Canterbury,  Bath, Merton, Stratford, Bury St. Edmonds, Glastonbury, and St.  Albans, suffered most, and many of those beautiful monuments of Gothic  architecture were levelled with the dust. Their destruction deprived  the people of many physical accommodations, for they had been  hospitals and caravansaries, as well as \"cages of unclean birds.\"  Neither the church nor the universities profited much from the  confiscation of so much property, and only six new bishoprics were  formed, and only fourteen abbeys were converted into cathedrals and  collegiate churches. The king and the nobles were the only gainers by  the spoil; the people obtained no advantage in that age, although they  have in succeeding ages.    After renouncing the pope's supremacy, and suppressing the  monasteries, where were collected the treasures of the middle ages,  one would naturally suppose that the king would have gone farther, and  changed the religion of his people. But Henry hated Luther and his  doctrines, and did not hate the pope, or the religion of which he was  the sovereign pontiff. He loved gold and new wives better than the  interests of the Catholic church. Reform proceeded no farther in his  reign; while, on the other hand, he caused a decree to pass both  houses of his timid, complying parliament, by which the doctrines of  transubstantiation, the communion of one kind, the celibacy of the  clergy, masses, and auricular confession, were established; and any  departure from, or denial of, these subjected the offender to the  punishment of death.    [Sidenote: Execution of Anne Boleyn.]    But Henry had new domestic difficulties long before the suppression of  monasteries--the great political act of Thomas Cromwell. His new wife,  Anne Boleyn, was suspected of the crime of inconstancy, and at the  very time when she had reached the summit of power, and the  gratification of all worldly wishes. She had been very vain, and fond  of display and of ornaments; but the latter years of her life were  marked by her munificence, and attachment to the reform doctrines. But  her power ceased almost as soon as she became queen. She could win,  but she could not retain, the affections of her royal husband. His  passion subsided into languor, and ended in disgust. The beauty of  Anne Boleyn was soon forgotten when Jane Seymour, her maid of honor,  attracted the attention of Henry. To make this lady his wife now  became the object of his life, and this could only be effected by the  divorce of his queen, who gave occasion for scandal by the levity and  freedom of her manners. Henry believed every insinuation against her,  because he wished to believe her guilty. There was but a step between  the belief of guilt and the resolution to destroy her. She was  committed to the Tower, impeached, brought to trial, condemned without  evidence, and executed without remorse. Even Cranmer, whom she had  honored and befriended, dared not defend her, although he must have  believed in her innocence. He knew the temper of the master whom he  served too well to risk much in her defence. She was the first woman  who had been beheaded in the annals of England. Not one of the  Plantagenet kings ever murdered a woman. But the age of chivalry was  past, and the sentiments it encouraged found no response in the bosom  of such a sensual and vindictive monarch as was Henry VIII.    The very day after the execution of that accomplished lady, for whose  sake the king had squandered the treasures of his kingdom, and had  kept Christendom in a ferment, he married Jane Seymour, \"the fairest,  discreetest, and most meritorious of all his wives,\" as the historians  say, yet a woman who did not hesitate to steal the affections of Henry  and receive his addresses, while his queen was devoted to her husband.  But Anne Boleyn had done so before her, and suffered a natural  retribution.    Jane Seymour lived only eighteen months after her marriage, and died  two days after giving birth to a son, afterwards Edward VI. She was  one of those passive women who make neither friends nor enemies. She  indulged in no wit or repartee, like her brilliant but less beautiful  predecessor, and she passed her regal life without uttering a sentence  or a sentiment which has been deemed worthy of preservation.    [Sidenote: Anne of Cleves--Catharine Howard.]    She had been dead about a month, when the king looked round for  another wife, and besought Francis I. to send the most beautiful  ladies of his kingdom to Calais, that he might there inspect them, and  select one according to his taste. But this Oriental notion was not  indulged by the French king, who had more taste and delicacy; and  Henry remained without a wife for more than two years, the princesses  of Europe not being very eager to put themselves in the power of this  royal Bluebeard. At last, at the suggestion of Cromwell, he was  affianced to Anne, daughter of the Duke of Cleves, whose home was on  the banks of the Rhine, in the city of Dusseldorf.    The king no sooner set his eyes on her than he was disappointed and  disgusted, and gave vent to his feelings before Cromwell, calling her  a \"great Flanders mare.\" Nevertheless, he consummated his marriage,  although his disgust constantly increased. This mistake of Cromwell  was fatal to his ambitious hopes. The king vented on him all the  displeasure which had been gathering in his embittered soul.  Cromwell's doom was sealed. He had offended an absolute monarch. He  was accused of heresy and treason,--the common accusations in that age  against men devoted to destruction,--tried by a servile board of  judges, condemned, and judicially murdered, in 1540. In his  misfortunes, he showed no more fortitude than Wolsey. The atmosphere  of a court is fatal to all moral elevation.    But, before his execution, Anne of Cleves, a virtuous and worthy  woman, was divorced, and Catharine Howard, granddaughter of the victor  of Flodden Field, became queen of England. The king now fancied that  his domestic felicity was complete; but, soon after his marriage, it  was discovered that his wife had formerly led a dissolute life, and  had been unfaithful also to her royal master. When the proofs of her  incontinence were presented to him, he burst into a flood of tears;  but soon his natural ferocity returned, and his guilty wife expiated  her crime by death on the scaffold, in 1542.    Henry's sixth and last wife was Catharine Parr, relict of Lord  Latimer, a woman of great sagacity, prudence, and good sense. She  favored the reformers, but had sufficient address to keep her opinions  from the king, who would have executed her, had he suspected her real  views. She survived her husband, who died four years after her  marriage, in 1547.    [Sidenote: Last Days of Henry.]    The last years of any tyrant are always melancholy, and those of Henry  were embittered by jealousies and domestic troubles. His finances were  deranged, his treasury exhausted, and his subjects discontented. He  was often at war with the Scots, and different continental powers. He  added religious persecution to his other bad traits, and executed, for  their opinions, some of the best people in the kingdom. His father had  left him the richest sovereign of Europe, and he had seized the abbey  lands, and extorted heavy sums from his oppressed people; and yet he  was poor. All his wishes were apparently gratified; and yet he was the  most miserable man in his dominions. He exhausted all the sources of  pleasure, and nothing remained but satiety and disgust. His mind and  his body were alike diseased. His inordinate gluttony made him most  inconveniently corpulent, and produced ulcers and the gout. It was  dangerous to approach this \"corrupt mass of dying tyranny.\" It was  impossible to please him, and the least contradiction drove him into  fits of madness and frenzy.    In his latter days, he ordered, in a fit of jealousy, the execution of  the Duke of Norfolk, the first nobleman of the kingdom, who had given  offence to the Earl of Hertford, uncle to the young prince of Wales,  and the founder of the greatness of the Seymours. But the tyrant died  before the sentence was carried into effect, much to the joy of the  good people of England, whom he had robbed and massacred. Several  thousands perished by the axe of the executioner during his  disgraceful reign, and some of them were the lights of the age, and  the glory of their country.    Tyrannical as was Henry VIII., still he ever ruled by the laws. He did  not abolish parliament, or retrench its privileges. The parliament  authorized all his taxes, and gave sanction to all his violent  measures. The parliament was his supple instrument; still, had the  parliament resisted his will, doubtless he would have dissolved it, as  did the Stuart princes. But it was not, in his reign, prepared for  resistance, and the king had every thing after his own way.    [Sidenote: Death of Henry VIII.]    By nature, he was amiable, generous, and munificent. But his temper  was spoiled by self-indulgence and incessant flattery. The moroseness  he exhibited in his latter days was partly the effect of physical  disease, brought about, indeed, by intemperance and gluttony. He was  faithful to his wives, so long as he lived with them; and, while he  doted on them, listened to their advice. But few of his advisers dared  tell him the truth; and Cranmer himself can never be exculpated from  flattering his perverted conscience. No one had the courage to tell  him he was dying but one of the nobles of the court. He died, in great  agony, June, 1547, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, and the  fifty-sixth of his age, and was buried, with great pomp, in St. George  Chapel, Windsor Castle.           *       *       *       *       *         REFERENCES.--The best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"Street, is an oaken figure called by the name of the notorious  tailor. It is in reality a statue of a man in armour, dating no further  back than the reign of Henry the Seventh; and, as a local antiquary  notes, \"to favour the posture of his leaning out of window, the arms  have been cut off at the elbows.\"[47] This statue, now generally  believed to have been intended for St. George, could not have been thus  appropriated and adapted to its present purpose until its original  design had been forgotten and the incongruity of its costume passed  unrecognized. This is said to have been in 1678, when a figure,  identified with the one in question, was put up in Grey Friars Lane by  Alderman Owen.    It must not be overlooked that there may have been from the first more  than one version of the legend, and that a version rejected by, or  perhaps unknown to, Roger of Wendover and the writers who followed him  may have always included the order to the inhabitants to keep within  doors, of which Peeping Tom would seem to be the necessary  accompaniment. Unfortunately, we have no evidence on this point. The  earliest record of such a version appears in one of the manuscript  volumes already alluded to. It has not been hitherto printed; and it is  so much at variance, alike with the legend preserved in the thirteenth  century, and the poem of the nineteenth century, that I quote it  entire:--\"The Franchisment and Freedome of Coventry was purchased in  manner Following. Godiva the wife of Leofric Earle of Chester and Duke  of March requesting of her Lord freedome for this That Towne, obtained  the same upon condition that she should ride naked through the same; who  for the Love she bare to the Inhabitants thereof, and the perpetuall  remembrance of her Great Affection thereunto, performed the same as  Followeth. In the forenoone all householders were Commanded to keep in  their Families shutting their doores and windows close whilst the  Dutchess performed this good deed, which done she rode naked through the  midst of the Towne, without any other Coverture save only her hair. But  about the midst of the Citty her horse neighed, whereat one desirous to  see the strange Case lett downe a Window, and looked out, for which fact  or for that the Horse did neigh, as the cause thereof, Though all the  Towne were Franchised, yet horses were not toll-free to this day.\"[48]    The manuscript in which this passage occurs is copied from an older  manuscript which appears to have been compiled in the sixteenth  century. Unfortunately, however, the latter is imperfect, a leaf having  been torn out at this very point. We cannot, therefore, say with  certainty that the account of the famous ride was ever comprised in it.  But the expressions made use of imply that the windows were closed with  shutters rather than glass, and that they were opened by letting down  the shutters, which were either loose or affixed by a hinge to the  bottom sills. It is a question exactly at what period glass came into  general use for windows in the burgesses' houses at Coventry. Down  almost to the middle of the fifteenth century all glass was imported;  and consequently it was not so common in the midlands as near the coast,  especially the south-eastern coast. We shall probably be on the safe  side if we assume that in the early years of the sixteenth century, at  all events, the ordinary dwelling-house at Coventry was no longer  destitute of this luxury. It would seem, therefore, that the story, in  the form here given, cannot be later, and may be much earlier, than the  latter years of the fifteenth century.    Failing definite evidence to carry us back further, it becomes of  importance to inquire whether there are any traditions in other places  from which we may reason. In the \"History of Gloucestershire,\" printed  by Samuel Rudder of Cirencester in 1779, we read that the parishioners  of St. Briavels, hard by the Forest of Dean, \"have a custom of  distributing yearly upon Whitsunday, after divine service, pieces of  bread and cheese to the congregation at church, to defray the expenses  of which every householder in the parish pays a penny to the  churchwardens; and this is said to be for the privilege of cutting and  taking the wood in Hudnolls. The tradition is that the privilege was  obtained of some Earl of Hereford, then lord of the Forest of Dean, at  the instance of his lady, upon the same hard terms that Lady Godiva  obtained the privileges for the citizens of Coventry.\" It appears that  Rudder, while in the main accurately relating both custom and tradition,  has made the mistake of supposing that the payment was made to the  churchwardens, whereas it was in all probability made to the constable  of the castle of St. Briavels as warden of the Forest of Dean. The  custom is now in a late stage of decadence, and local inquiries have  failed to elicit any further details throwing light on the point under  consideration.[49]    I am not aware of any other European tradition that will bear comparison  with that of Godiva, but Liebrecht relates that he remembers in his  youth, about the year 1820, in a German newspaper, a story according to  which a countess frees her husband's subjects from a heavy punishment  imposed by him. She undertakes to walk a certain course clad only in her  shift, and she performs it, but clad in a shift of iron.[50] The  condition is here eluded rather than fulfilled; and the point of the  story is consequently varied. It would be interesting to have the tale  unearthed from the old newspaper, and to know where its scene was laid,  and whether it was a genuine piece of folklore.    Eastern tales, however, furnish us repeatedly with incidents in which a  lady parades the streets of a city, and during her progress all folk are  bidden to close their shops and withdraw into their houses on pain of  death. The example of the Princess Badroulbadour will occur to every  reader of the \"Arabian Nights.\" This, however, is by no means a solitary  example. In the story of Kamar Al-Zaman and the Jeweller's Wife, one of  the stories of the \"Nights\" rejected on moral grounds by Lane, but  translated by Burton, a dervish relates that he chanced one Friday to  enter the city of Bassorah, and found the streets deserted. The shops  were open; but neither man nor woman, girl nor boy, dog nor cat was to  be seen. By and by he heard a sound of drums, and hiding himself in a  coffee-house, he looked out through a crevice and saw forty pairs of  slave girls, with uncovered heads and faces displayed, come walking  through the market, and in their midst a lady riding unveiled and  adorned with gold and gems. In front of her was a damsel bearing in  baldric a great sword with haft of emerald and tassels of  jewel-encrusted gold. Pausing close to the dervish, the lady said to her  maidens: \"I hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop; so do ye search  it, lest haply there be one hidden there, with intent to enjoy a look at  us while we have our faces unveiled.\" Accordingly they searched the shop  opposite the coffee-house, and brought forth a man. At the lady's  command the damsel with the sword smote off his head, and leaving the  corpse lying on the ground, the procession swept on. It turned out that  the lady was the wife of a jeweller to whom the King of Bassorah was  desirous of granting a boon, and at her request the boon obtained was a  proclamation commanding that all the townsfolk should every Friday enter  the mosques two hours before the hour of prayer, so that none might  abide in the town, great or small, unless they were in the mosques or in  the houses with the doors locked upon them; but all the shops were to be  left open. Then the lady had permission to ride with her slave-women  through the heart of the town, and none were to look on her from window  or lattice; and every one whom she found abroad she was at liberty to  kill. A similar incident is related in the life of Kurroglu, the  robber-poet of Persia, where a beautiful princess passes in state  through the bazaars every Friday on her way to the mosque, while all the  men are banished.[51] Here, again, some one was of course found playing  the spy.    A version of the incident, which can be traced further back in literary  form than either of the foregoing, occurs in the \"Ardshi-Bordshi.\" This  book is a Mongolian recension of a Sanskrit collection of stories  concerning Vikramaditya, a monarch who, if he ever lived, seems to have  flourished about the beginning of the Christian era. He was celebrated,  like Solomon, for his wisdom and his might; and his name became the  centre of a vast accretion of legends. Some of these legends were  translated into Mongolian late in the Middle Ages, and formed a small  collection called after Ardshi-Bordshi, the nominal hero. In the story  to which I wish to direct attention, a certain king has a daughter  bearing the name of Sunshine, of whom he was so jealous that if any one  looked upon her his eyes were put out, and the man who entered her  apartments had his legs broken. Naturally, the young lady got tired of  being thus immured, and complained to her father that, as she had no  opportunity of seeing man or beast, the time hung heavily on her hands;  and she begged him to let her go out on the fifteenth of the month and  look about her. The king agreed to this; but, the sly old rascal!  nothing was further from his intention than to gratify his daughter's  longing for masculine converse. Wherefore he issued a decree that all  objects for sale were to be exposed openly to the view, all cattle to be  left indoors, the men and women were to withdraw into their houses and  close their doors and windows, and if any one came forth he should be  severely punished. On the appointed day, Sunshine, surrounded by her  ladies, and seated in a brand-new chariot, drove through the town, and  viewed the merchandise and goods"]]]
