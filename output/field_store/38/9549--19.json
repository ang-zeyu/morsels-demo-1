[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#16)"],[1," My own views, that the great object on the part  of the Government, was to get these roads operated; and that to go  into an inquiry as to the cost of construction, would be impracticable,  either as to the cost of construction or as to any certain rule of  compensation, because many of them were constructed under the pressure  of war, and for temporary Purposes. The object of arriving at the cash  value or equivalent for the roads was not only impracticable, but really  of very little practical interest in comparison with the great end of  having the channels of commerce in the rebel states opened and carried  on, with a view of getting out their produce, furnishing supplies, and  getting commerce in its regular channels. In my own view, that appeared  to be the most, certain and most speedy system of reconstruction we  could adopt, and that it would tend more to establish harmony than any  other thing that could be done by the Government. In view of all this,  and after the most deliberate consideration we could give it, it was the  opinion of the Quartermaster General and myself--certainly my own--that  it would be impracticable to make any distinction: and so far as I know,  no distinction was made in any part of the country in reference to roads  built by the Government and roads that had been constructed by Companies  before the war commenced.    Mr. Stanton was asked this question:    Suppose the Government, at his own expense, had constructed seventy  miles of railroad in one of the rebel States, and that, at the close  of the war, a company should apply to the Executive Department of the  Government for a transfer of the road so constructed to it; by what  authority or provision of law would Executive Department be authorized  to transfer the road so constructed to the company making the  application?    Mr. Stanton answered:    I do not know of any act of Congress that directly, in terms, would  authorize any such transfer; but regarding the construction of the road,  in time of war, simply as a means, or instrument, of carrying on war,  when the war was over I would consider it strictly proven and within  the scope of the power of the General Commanding, or especially of the  President of the United States, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army,  to render that instrument as available for peace purposes as possible.  And inasmuch as the road would be entirely useless unless it was  operated, and it would be for the benefit and interest of the public,  to have it operated as speedily as possible, I think it would be in the  interest of a wise discretion, and exercising proper authority, to turn  over that road to any company or individual who would operate it; for,  in that way, he would be applying the war material to the only available  use to which it could be applied. * * * I would regard the rolling stock  as coming, to a certain extent, within the same principle. * * * No  transfer of title was at any time made, so far as I know, or could be  made, but only possession turned over. When the military use was no  longer required, the railroads were turned over to their original  owners, or their representatives, with permission to use them. These  railroads, their plant and track fixtures, real property, of which the  military authorities had only the possessory right and use, but the  rolling stock and equipments, and iron not laid down, were personal  property, which, by capture, or purchase, or construction, belonged to  the United States. Sale could be made, and was made, of the personal  property at values estimated by the proper officers. That which  constituted real estate, to-wit, the railroad track, fixtures, etc., the  military authorities might abandon altogether, or relinquish control and  turn over possession to those who would make a beneficial use of it by  working the road. Being in the nature of real estate, no title of  the Government or of other persons could be divested and conveyed  by military authority, but only the control relinquished and the use  permitted during the existence of military authority in the department  where the roads were situated.    The trend of a large portion of the testimony of witnesses called  by this committee to testify as to the charges preferred against Mr.  Johnson and relating to other allegations of the indictment, quite  clearly indicated that the charges were based solely upon common street  rumor, invented and given currency in partisan antagonism and for  partisan purposes, and that the witnesses were called in the hope and  expectation, on the part of the majority of the House, of developing  proof of disloyalty and corruption on the part of the President, and,  if not criminal connivance, at least, criminal knowledge of a conspiracy  for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.    But these expectations and hopes, in all respects, were so utterly  disappointed, that there was pathos, at least, as the investigation  was protracted from month to month, with no indication of the hoped for  development, in the despondent inquiry of Mr. Thaddeus Stevens to one of  his colleagues of the Impeachment Committee, as the inquest approached  a close without results--\"Well, HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING, ANYHOW?\" It was  more an ejaculation of anger and disgust at failure, than a query of one  seeking hoped for information.        CHAPTER V. --  THE TENURE-OF-OFFICE ACT.    ITS HISTORY AND PURPOSE--THE PRESIDENTS VETO MESSAGE.    Mr. Johnson's alleged violation of the act of Congress known as  the Tenure-of-Office Act, constituted the ostensible basis of his  impeachment in 1868. As stated, it had been passed for the purpose of  restricting the power of the President over Executive appointments. That  Act, therefore, becomes a very important and conspicuous incident in  the impeachment affair, as its alleged violation constituted the only  material accusation, set out in various forms, in the entire list of  charges.    The proceedings had on the passage of that bill are inserted at some  length here, as a technical knowledge of its history, character and  purpose, is essential to a correct apprehension of the controversy that  had arisen between the President and Congress.    The Tenure-of-Office bill was introduced in the Senate by Mr. Williams,  of Oregon, Dec. 3rd, 1866, and on the 5th was referred to the Committee  on Retrenchment. On the 10th Mr. Edmunds, in the name of the committee,  reported it back to the Senate with the following remarks:    The joint select Committee on Retrenchment, to whom was referred  the bill to regulate the tenure of offices, have had the same under  consideration, and have instructed me to report the bill back, with a  recommendation of certain amendments, which being adopted, the committee  are of the opinion that the bill ought to pass. I beg leave to say in  connection with this report that we have reported this bill and these  amendments regulating removals from office and appointments to office so  far as concerns officers whose nominations require the confirmation of  the Senate, and have adopted what appears to us to be a feasible  scheme in that respect, in no spirit of hostility to any party or  administration whatever, but in what we conceive to be the true  Republican interest of the country, under all administrations, under  the domination of all parties in the growth which is before us in the  future; and in that spirit I shall ask the attention of the Senate to  the bill when it comes to be considered. I move that the amendment be  printed, and that the bill be made the special order for Thursday next,  at one o'clock.    On the 10th of January, 1867, on motion of Mr. Edmunds, the bill was  taken up for consideration. As the first section of the bill was the  only portion over which there was any serious controversy, or pertinent  to this recital, only that section is produced here. It is as follows:    That every person (excepting the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury,  of War, of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster General, and  the Attorney General), holding any civil office to which he has been  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall  become duly qualified to act therein, is, and shall be, entitled to hold  such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed  and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided.    Mr. Howe objected to the exception of the Cabinet officers from the  operation of the bill, and Mr. Edmunds responded that:    It did seem to the Committee, after a great deal of consultation and  reflection, that it was right and just that the Chief Executive of the  Nation, in selecting these named Secretaries, who, by law, and by the  practice of the country, and officers analogous to whom by the practice  of all other countries, are the confidential advisers of the Executive  respecting the administration of all his Departments, should be persons  who were personally agreeable to him, in whom he could place entire  confidence and reliance, and that whenever it should seem to him that  the state of relations, between him and any of them had become such  as to render this relation of confidence and trust and personal esteem  inharmonious, HE SHOULD IN SUCH CASE BE ALLOWED TO DISPENSE WITH THE  SERVICES OF THAT OFFICER IN VACATION AND HAVE SOME OTHER PERSON ACT IN  HIS STEAD. We thought that so much discretion, so much confidence, so  much respect ought to be properly attributed to the Chief Magistrate of  the Nation. It may happen that at some particular time--some people  may suppose that it has happened now--the Chief Magistrate for the time  being ought not to be invested with such powers; but the Committee have  recommended the adoption of this rule respecting the tenure-of-office  as a permanent and systematic, and as they believe, an appropriate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#16)"],[1,"connected with Joe in  the translation and publication of the book.    In explanation of the change of plan necessarily adopted in the  translation, the following preface appeared in the first edition of the  book, but was dropped later:--    \"TO THE READER.    \"As many false reports have been circulated respecting the following  work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to  destroy me, and also the work, I would inform you that I translated,  by the gift and power of God, and caused to be written, one hundred  and sixteen pages, the which I took from the book of Lehi, which was an  account abridged from the plates of Lehi, by the hand of Mormon; which  said account, some person or persons have stolen and kept from me,  notwithstanding my utmost efforts to recover it again--and being  commanded of the Lord that I should not translate the same over again,  for Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God,  by altering the words; that they did read contrary from that which I  translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the  same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same  over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan  would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive  this work, but behold, the Lord said unto me, I will not suffer that  Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing; therefore thou  shalt translate from the plates of Nephi until ye come to that which ye  have translated, which ye have retained; and behold, ye shall publish it  as the record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered  my words. I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work; yea, I will  show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the Devil.  Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through  His grace and mercy, accomplished that which He hath commanded me  respecting this thing. I would also inform you that the plates of which  hath been spoken, were found in the township of Manchester, Ontario  County, New York.--THE AUTHOR.\"    In June, 1829, Smith accepted an invitation to change his residence to  the house of Peter Whitmer, who, with his sons, David, John, and Peter,  Jr., lived at Fayette, Seneca County, New York, the Whitmers promising  his board free and their assistance in the work of translation. There,  Smith says, they resided \"until the translation was finished and the  copyright secured.\"    As five of the Whitmers were \"witnesses\" to the existence of the plates,  and David continued to be a person of influence in Mormon circles  throughout his long life, information about them is of value. The  prophet's mother again comes to our aid, although her account conflicts  with her son's. The prophet says that David Whitmer brought the  invitation to take up quarters at his father's, and volunteered the  offer of free board and assistance. Mother Smith says that one day, as  Joe was translating the plates, he came, in the midst of the words  of the Holy Writ, to a commandment to write at once to David Whitmer,  requesting him to come immediately and take the prophet and Cowdery to  his house, \"as an evil-designing people were seeking to take away his  [Joseph's] life in order to prevent the work of God from going forth to  the world.\" When the letter arrived, David's father told him that,  as they had wheat sown that would require two days' harrowing, and a  quantity of plaster to spread, he could not go \"unless he could get a  witness from God that it was absolutely necessary.\" In answer to his  inquiry of the Lord on the subject, David was told to go as soon as his  wheat was harrowed in. Setting to work, he found that at the end of the  first day the two days' harrowing had been completed, and, on going out  the next morning to spread the plaster, he found that work done also,  and his sister told him she had seen three unknown men at work in the  field the day before: so that the task had been accomplished by \"an  exhibition of supernatural power.\"*         * \"Biographical Sketches,\" Lucy Smith, p. 135.      The translation being ready for the press, in June, 1829 (I follow  Tucker's account of the printing of the work), Joseph, his brother  Hyrum, Cowdery, and Harris asked Egbert B. Grandin, publisher of the  Wayne Sentinel at Palmyra, to give them an estimate of the cost of  printing an edition of three thousand copies, with Harris as security  for the payment. Grandin told them he did not want to undertake the job  at any price, and he tried to persuade Harris not to invest his money  in the scheme, assuring him that it was fraudulent. Application was next  made to Thurlow Weed, then the publisher of the Anti-Masonic Inquirer,  at Rochester, New York. \"After reading a few chapters,\" says Mr. Weed,  \"it seemed such a jumble of unintelligent absurdities that we refused  the work, advising Harris not to mortgage his farm and beggar his  family.\" Finally, Smith and his associates obtained from Elihu F.  Marshall, a Rochester publisher, a definite bid for the work, and with  this they applied again to Grandin, explaining that it would be much  more convenient for them to have the printing done at home, and pointing  out to him that he might as well take the job, as his refusal would not  prevent the publication of the book. This argument had weight with him,  and he made a definite contract to print and bind five thousand copies  for the sum of $3000, a mortgage on Harris's farm to be given him as  security. Mrs. Harris had persisted in her refusal to be in any way a  party to the scheme, and she and her husband had finally made a legal  separation, with a division of the property, after she had entered a  complaint against Joe, charging him with getting money from her husband  on fraudulent representation. At the hearing on this complaint, Harris  denied that he had ever contributed a dollar to Joe at the latter's  persuasion.    Tucker, who did much of the proof-reading of the new Bible, comparing it  with the manuscript copy, says that, when the printing began, Smith  and his associates watched the manuscript with the greatest vigilance,  bringing to the office every morning as much as the printers could set  up during the day, and taking it away in the evening, forbidding also  any alteration. The foreman, John H. Gilbert, found the manuscript  so poorly prepared as regards grammatical construction, spelling,  punctuation, etc., that he told them that some corrections must be made,  and to this they finally consented.    Daniel Hendrix, in his recollections, says in confirmation of this:--    \"I helped to read proof on many pages of the book, and at odd times set  some type.... The penmanship of the copy furnished was good, but the  grammar, spelling and punctuation were done by John H. Gilbert, who was  chief compositor in the office. I have heard him swear many a time at  the syntax and orthography of Cowdery, and declare that he would not set  another line of the type. There were no paragraphs, no punctuation and  no capitals. All that was done in the printing office, and what a  time there used to be in straightening sentences out, too. During the  printing of the book I remember that Joe Smith kept in the background.\"    The following letter is in reply to an inquiry addressed by me to Albert  Chandler, the only survivor, I think, of the men who helped issue the  first edition of Smith's book:--    \"COLDWATER, MICH., Dec. 22, 1898.    \"My recollections of Joseph Smith, Jr. and of the first steps taken in  regard to his Bible have never been printed. At the time of the printing  of the Mormon Bible by Egbert B. Grandin of the Sentinel I was an  apprentice in the bookbindery connected with the Sentinel office. I  helped to collate and stitch the Gold Bible, and soon after this was  completed, I changed from book-binding to printing. I learned my trade  in the Sentinel office.    \"My recollections of the early history of the Mormon Bible are vivid  to-day. I knew personally Oliver Cowdery, who translated the Bible,  Martin Harris, who mortgaged his farm to procure the printing, and  Joseph Smith Jr., but slightly. What I knew of him was from hearsay,  principally from Martin Harris, who believed fully in him. Mr. Tucker's  'Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism' is the fullest account I have  ever seen. I doubt if I can add anything to that history.    \"The whole history is shrouded in the deepest mystery. Joseph Smith Jr.,  who read through the wonderful spectacles, pretended to give the scribe  the exact reading of the plates, even to spelling, in which Smith was  woefully deficient. Martin Harris was permitted to be in the room with  the scribe, and would try the knowledge of Smith, as he told me, saying  that Smith could not spell the word February, when his eyes were off the  spectacles through which he pretended to work. This ignorance of Smith  was proof positive to him that Smith was dependent on the spectacles for  the contents of the Bible. Smith and the plates containing the original  of the Mormon Bible were hid from view of the scribe and Martin Harris  by a screen.    \"I should think that Martin Harris, after becoming a convert, gave up  his entire time to advertising the Bible to his neighbors and the public  generally in the vicinity of Palmyra. He would call public meetings and  address them himself. He was enthusiastic, and went so far as to say  that God, through the Latter Day Saints, was to rule the world. I heard  him make this statement, that there would never be another President of  the United States elected; that soon all temporal and spiritual power  would be given over to the prophet Joseph Smith and the Latter Day  Saints. His extravagant statements were the laughing stock of the people  of Palmyra. His stories were hissed at, universally. To give you an idea  of Mr. Harris's"]]]
