Another  point of importance in practising the exercise for strengthening the  opening and the closing muscles is the breathing after every tone; and  this must be done gently and without effort, the only perception which  the singer should have of it being a slight movement of the midriff.  When you can sing the exercise in this manner on _F_, your supposed  speaking tone, then go up the scale, semitone by semitone, to _B_ or _C_  above, and down again, semitone by semitone, to _B_ or _C_ below. Of the  quality of tone I will say nothing here, because that part of the  subject will be discussed later on in connection with the tongue and the  soft palate.    The next thing in connection with the physiology of the vocal organ from  which we can deduct a practical lesson is the action of the muscles  governing the pitch of the voice. This process is a very complex one,  and can be made clear only by _viva voce_ explanations, with the help of  good models and moving diagrams, by demonstrations with the  laryngoscope, and by carefully watching external signs. There is no  doubt, however, that a set of muscles, described as the \"Stretching and  Slackening Muscles,\" play the most important part in this matter, and I  advise the reader to study carefully the chapter on \"The Movements of  the Voicebox,\" and try the experiments mentioned in it. It will thus be  seen that the flexibility of the voice depends in a great measure upon  the control we have over the muscles governing the pitch; that is to  say, upon the readiness and exactness with which we are able to allow  them to contract or to relax.    Performers upon various instruments, as for instance the piano and the  violin, know that certain exercises are indispensable to brilliant  execution, because they strengthen the muscles of the wrist and of the  fingers, and make them obedient to the will. It has even been found that  simple finger gymnastics, exercising separately different sets of  muscles, and making them independent of each other, are of the greatest  value, and save long hours of tedious and wearisome practising. In a  similar manner we may spare ourselves much trouble and gain our end most  readily by vocal gymnastics, calculated to bring into play the  stretching and slackening muscles of the larynx. There is no difficulty  about it. Sing F, the same tone from which we started when exercising  the opening and the closing muscles, and add to it G. The alteration of  the pitch is brought about by a contraction of the stretching muscles  overcoming the resistance of the opposing slackening muscles, thereby  _tensing_ the vocal ligaments. If you again sing F, the case is  reversed, and the new alteration in pitch is brought about by a  contraction of the slackening muscles overcoming the resistance of the  opposing stretching muscles, thereby _relaxing_ the vocal ligaments.    [Illustration: musical notation    _o_         _o_  _ah_        _ah_  _ai_        _ai_    The above is an example. Take great care to render it perfectly. Sing  every tone clearly and distinctly, but without jerking, at the same time  _uniting_ all the tones, but without drawling. Do not try how quickly  you can sing, but rather how distinctly. Commence slowly, and be in no  hurry to increase the speed. Raise and lower the exercise semitone by  semitone within the medium part of your voice. A variety of exercises  founded upon the same principles may be introduced, and will serve to  increase the flexibility of the voice in a very short time.    Now we come to the \"Registers\" of the voice. I have defined a register  as \"a series of tones produced by the same mechanism.\" The five  registers of which the human voice, taken as a whole, consists, are  carefully described, and the means by which they are formed minutely  explained in a former part of this book. These registers, nevertheless,  continue to be a stumbling-stone to many, and the fact of the existence  in the throat of different actions for the production of different  series of tones has led some teachers into the deplorable mistake of  developing and exaggerating them, instead of, on the contrary, smoothing  them over and equalizing them. The result is that we often hear singers  who seem to have two or three different _voices_. They are growling in  the one, moaning in the second, and shrieking in the third; while it  should have been their aim so to blend and to unite the registers as to  make it difficult even for a practised ear to distinguish the one from  the other. Such singing is outrageous, and I protest against the opinion  expressed in some quarters that it is the natural outcome of the  teachings of the laryngoscope.    In developing and strengthening the registers I base my first exercises  upon the fact that the \"Vowel Scale\" goes from low to high in this  order; _oo_, _oh_, _ah_, _ai_, _ee_, so that consequently the highest  tones will be produced most readily when singing the vowels in the order  just given.    [Illustration: musical notation    _o_   _ah_   _ai_   _ee_   _ai_    _ah_   _o_  _oo_  _o_    _ah_   _ai_    _ah_    _o_    _oo_    Sing this exercise quite softly, strike each tone clearly and  distinctly, and take a _slight_ inspiration after every tone. Be careful  to take a full inflation only at the beginning, and afterwards to inhale  _less_ air than has been consumed in every preceding tone, or you will  after a while overcrowd the lungs, and experience a sensation of being  choked. This is a thing to be avoided in any case; but under present  circumstances it should be remembered that the short inspirations are  not taken for the purpose of re-filling the lungs, but simply to compel  the \"opening and closing muscles\" to do their work. By so doing we give  them six times more exercise than by breathing only once at the  beginning; and, what is more important still with regard to our  immediate object, we greatly facilitate the task of the vocal ligaments  to arrange themselves in different ways according to the registers they  are to produce.    It is self-evident that the danger of carrying the mechanism of a  register beyond its proper limit is greater if the vocal ligaments are  kept together, than it would be if they were made to separate, thereby  being enabled to close again under different conditions. It will be  seen, therefore, that the slight inspirations after every tone are an  essential part of the exercise, and must on no account be omitted. The  exercise is to be taken at a convenient pitch, and then to be raised  semitone by semitone in accordance with the requirements of individual  voices. It may, after some time, be taken right through upon the vowel  _ah_, and finally _legato_, gradually increasing the speed, to the  Italian word _scala_, singing the syllable _la_ to the last note.    The change from one register to another should always be made a couple  of tones below the extreme limit, so that there will be at the juncture  of every two registers a few \"optional\" tones which it is possible to  take with both mechanisms. The singer will be wise, however, to avail  himself of the power of producing an optional tone with the mechanism of  the lower register only on rare occasions. To force the register beyond  its natural limit is, of course, infinitely worse, and should never be  tolerated. The practice carries its own punishment, as it invariably  ruins the voice; and tones so produced always betray the effort  (frequently in a most painful degree), and are consequently never  beautiful.    It is to be observed that the exercise given above may be varied to any  extent, so long as it is based upon the principle which has been  explained. The beneficial results in the development of the voice will  speedily be noticed, and then sustained tones may be sung through the  whole compass after the orthodox fashion.    This brings me to the consideration of the \"mixed voice,\" which is  essential in bridging over the break between the \"upper thick\" and the  \"lower thin\" of the tenor, and which is also frequently made use of by  baritones and basses in the production of their highest tones.    The \"voce mista\" is \"mixed\" in this sense, that it combines the  _vibrating mechanism_ of the \"lower thin\" with the _position of the  larynx_ of the \"lower thick;\" that is to say, while the vibrations are  confined to the thin inner edges of the vocal ligaments, the larynx  itself takes a lower position in the throat than for the \"lower thin,\"  and the result is a remarkable increase of volume without any  corresponding additional effort in the production of tone. A few trials  before a looking-glass will at once prove the correctness of this  explanation, and, what is of more practical consequence, will enable the  student with a little practice to overcome the serious difficulty of  singing high tones without straining, yet with a fulness capable of  being increased or diminished at pleasure.    The last thing we have to consider is the \"resonator\" of the human  voice, namely, the upper part of the throat, the mouth, and the nose.  Whether we sing _ah_, _ai_, _ee_, _o_, or _oo_, the original tone  produced by the vibrations of the vocal ligaments is in either case  absolutely the same, and it takes the form of one vowel or another,  solely according to the shape which the \"resonator\" assumes, and which  may be described as a mould into which the tone is cast. The quality of  the voice also--its throatiness, its nasal twang, its shrillness,  harshness, and ugliness, or its purity, roundness, fulness, and  beauty--depend mainly upon the nature of the resonator, and upon the  way in which we work it. It is, therefore, a matter of the highest  importance to be fully acquainted with this part of the vocal apparatus,  and I hope my readers will follow me in a brief consideration of it with  the more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#16)"],[1,"was Uncle Roger's own room when he      stayed here; living in it for a few days served to give me more      insight to his character--or rather to his mind--than I could have      otherwise had.  It is just the kind of place I like myself; so,      naturally, I understand the other chap who liked it too.  It is a      fine big room, not quite within the Castle, but an outlying part of      it.  It is not detached, or anything of that sort, but is a sort of      garden-room built on to it.  There seems to have been always some      sort of place where it is, for the passages and openings inside seem      to accept or recognize it.  It can be shut off if necessary--it would      be in case of attack--by a great slab of steel, just like the door of      a safe, which slides from inside the wall, and can be operated from      either inside or outside--if you know how.  That is from my room or      from within the keep.  The mechanism is a secret, and no one but      Rooke and I know it.  The room opens out through a great French      window--the French window is modern, I take it, and was arranged by      or for Uncle Roger; I think there must have been always a large      opening there, for centuries at least--which opens on a wide terrace      or balcony of white marble, extending right and left.  From this a      white marble stair lies straight in front of the window, and leads      down to the garden.  The balcony and staircase are quite ancient--of      old Italian work, beautifully carved, and, of course, weather-worn      through centuries.  There is just that little tinging of green here      and there which makes all outdoor marble so charming.  It is hard to      believe at times that it is a part of a fortified castle, it is so      elegant and free and open.  The first glance of it would make a      burglar's heart glad.  He would say to himself: \"Here is the sort of      crib I like when I'm on the job.  You can just walk in and out as you      choose.\"  But, Aunt Janet, old Roger was cuter than any burglar.  He      had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled      burglar.  There are two steel shields which can slide out from the      wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window.      One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond-shaped      lozenges.  Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through; and yet      you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view--much the      same as you ladies can see through your veils.  The other is a great      sheet of steel, which slides out in a similar way in different      grooves.  It is not, of course, so heavy and strong as the safe-door      which covers the little opening in the main wall, but Rooke tells me      it is proof against the heaviest rifle-hall.        Having told you this, I must tell you, too, Aunt Janet, lest you      should be made anxious by the _arriere-pensee_ of all these warlike      measures of defence, that I always sleep at night with one of these      iron screens across the window.  Of course, when I am awake I leave      it open.  As yet I have tried only, but not used, the grille; and I      don't think I shall ever use anything else, for it is a perfect      guard.  If it should be tampered with from outside it would sound an      alarm at the head of the bed, and the pressing of a button would roll      out the solid steel screen in front of it.  As a matter of fact, I      have been so used to the open that I don't feel comfortable shut in.      I only close windows against cold or rain.  The weather here is      delightful--as yet, at all events--but they tell me that the rainy      season will be on us before very long.        I think you will like my den, aunty dear, though it will doubtless be      a worry to you to see it so untidy.  But that can't be helped.  I      must be untidy _somewhere_; and it is best in my own den!        Again I find my letter so long that I must cut it off now and go on      again to-night.  So this must go as it stands.  I shall not cause you      to wait to hear all I can tell you about our new home.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                           _January_ 29, 1907.        MY DEAR AUNT JANET,        My den looks out, as I told you in my last letter, on the garden, or,      to speak more accurately, on _one_ of the gardens, for there are      acres of them.  This is the old one, which must be almost as old as      the Castle itself, for it was within the defences in the old days of      bows.  The wall that surrounds the inner portion of it has long ago      been levelled, but sufficient remains at either end where it joined      the outer defences to show the long casemates for the bowmen to shoot      through and the raised stone gallery where they stood.  It is just      the same kind of building as the stone-work of the sentry's walk on      the roof and of the great old guard-room under it.        But whatever the garden may have been, and no matter how it was      guarded, it is a most lovely place.  There are whole sections of      garden here of various styles--Greek, Italian, French, German, Dutch,      British, Spanish, African, Moorish--all the older nationalities.  I      am going to have a new one laid out for you--a Japanese garden.  I      have sent to the great gardener of Japan, Minaro, to make the plans      for it, and to come over with workmen to carry it out.  He is to      bring trees and shrubs and flowers and stone-work, and everything      that can be required; and you shall superintend the finishing, if not      the doing, of it yourself.  We have such a fine head of water here,      and the climate is, they tell me, usually so lovely that we can do      anything in the gardening way.  If it should ever turn out that the      climate does not suit, we shall put a great high glass roof over it,      and _make_ a suitable climate.        This garden in front of my room is the old Italian garden.  It must      have been done with extraordinary taste and care, for there is not a      bit of it which is not rarely beautiful.  Sir Thomas Browne himself,      for all his _Quincunx_, would have been delighted with it, and have      found material for another \"Garden of Cyrus.\"  It is so big that      there are endless \"episodes\" of garden beauty I think all Italy must      have been ransacked in old times for garden stone-work of exceptional      beauty; and these treasures have been put together by some      master-hand.  Even the formal borders of the walks are of old porous      stone, which takes the weather-staining so beautifully, and are      carved in endless variety.  Now that the gardens have been so long      neglected or left in abeyance, the green staining has become perfect.      Though the stone-work is itself intact, it has all the picturesque      effect of the wear and ruin wrought by many centuries.  I am having      it kept for you just as it is, except that I have had the weeds and      undergrowth cleared away so that its beauties might be visible.        But it is not merely the architect work of the garden that is so      beautiful, nor is the assembling there of the manifold wealth of      floral beauty--there is the beauty that Nature creates by the hand of      her servant, Time.  You see, Aunt Janet, how the beautiful garden      inspires a danger-hardened old tramp like me to high-grade sentiments      of poetic fancy!  Not only have limestone and sandstone, and even      marble, grown green in time, but even the shrubs planted and then      neglected have developed new kinds of beauty of their own.  In some      far-distant time some master-gardener of the Vissarions has tried to      realize an idea--that of tiny plants that would grow just a little      higher than the flowers, so that the effect of an uneven floral      surface would be achieved without any hiding of anything in the      garden seen from anywhere.  This is only my reading of what has been      from the effect of what is!  In the long period of neglect the shrubs      have outlived the flowers.  Nature has been doing her own work all      the time in enforcing the survival of the fittest.  The shrubs have      grown and grown, and have overtopped flower and weed, according to      their inherent varieties of stature; to the effect that now you see      irregularly scattered through the garden quite a number--for it is a      big place--of vegetable products which from a landscape standpoint      have something of the general effect of statues without the cramping      feeling of detail.  Whoever it was that laid out that part of the      garden or made the choice of items, must have taken pains to get      strange specimens, for all those taller shrubs are in special      colours, mostly yellow or white--white cypress, white holly, yellow      yew, grey-golden box, silver juniper, variegated maple, spiraea, and      numbers of dwarf shrubs whose names I don't know.  I only know that      when the moon shines--and this, my dear Aunt Janet, is the very land      of moonlight itself!--they all look ghastly pale.  The effect is      weird to the last degree, and I am sure that you will enjoy it.  For      myself, as you know, uncanny things hold no fear.  I suppose it is      that I have been up against so many different kinds of fears, or,      rather, of things which for most people have terrors of their own,      that I have come to have a contempt--not an active contempt, you      know, but a tolerative contempt--for the whole family of them.  And      you, too, will enjoy yourself here famously, I know.  You'll have to      collect all the stories of such matters in "]]]
