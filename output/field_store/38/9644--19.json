Flattered by this artful speech,  Thor was induced to consent to a friendly journey to Joetun-heim,  and the two gods set out, leaving the three marvellous weapons at  home. They had not gone far, however, ere they came to the house of  the giantess Grid, one of Odin's many wives. Seeing Thor unarmed,  she warned him to beware of treachery and lent him her own girdle,  staff, and glove. Some time after leaving her, Thor and Loki came to  the river Veimer, which the Thunderer, accustomed to wading, prepared  to ford, bidding Loki and Thialfi cling fast to his belt.    In the middle of the stream, however, a sudden cloud-burst and freshet  overtook them; the waters began to rise and roar, and although Thor  leaned heavily upon his staff, he was almost swept away by the force  of the raging current.          \"Wax not, Veimer,      Since to wade I desire      To the realm of the giants!      Know, if thou waxest,      Then waxes my asa-might      As high as the heavens.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      Thor now became aware of the presence, up stream, of Geirrod's daughter  Gialp, and rightly suspecting that she was the cause of the storm, he  picked up a huge boulder and flung it at her, muttering that the best  place to dam a river was at its source. The missile had the desired  effect, for the giantess fled, the waters abated, and Thor, exhausted  but safe, pulled himself up on the opposite bank by a little shrub, the  mountain-ash or sorb. This has since been known as \"Thor's salvation,\"  and occult powers have been attributed to it. After resting awhile  Thor and his companions resumed their journey; but upon arriving at  Geirrod's house the god was so exhausted that he sank wearily upon  the only chair in sight. To his surprise, however, he felt it rising  beneath him, and fearful lest he should be crushed against the rafters,  he pushed the borrowed staff against the ceiling and forced the  chair downward with all his might. Then followed a terrible cracking,  sudden cries, and moans of pain; and when Thor came to investigate,  it appeared that the giant's daughters, Gialp and Greip, had slipped  under his chair with intent treacherously to slay him, and they had  reaped a righteous retribution and both lay crushed to death.          \"Once I employed      My asa-might      In the realm of giants,      When Gialp and Greip,      Geirrod's daughters,      Wanted to lift me to heaven.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      Geirrod now appeared and challenged Thor to a test of strength and  skill, but without waiting for a preconcerted signal, he flung a  red-hot wedge at him. Thor, quick of eye and a practised catcher,  caught the missile with the giantess's iron glove, and hurled it  back at his opponent. Such was the force of the god, that the missile  passed, not only through the pillar behind which the giant had taken  refuge, but through him and the wall of the house, and buried itself  deep in the earth without.    Thor then strode up to the giant's corpse, which at the blow from his  weapon had been petrified into stone, and set it up in a conspicuous  place, as a monument of his strength and of the victory he had won  over his redoubtable foes, the mountain giants.        The Worship of Thor    Thor's name has been given to many of the places he was wont to  frequent, such as the principal harbour of the Faroe Islands, and to  families which claim to be descended from him. It is still extant  in such names as Thunderhill in Surrey, and in the family names of  Thorburn and Thorwaldsen, but is most conspicuous in the name of one  of the days of the week, Thor's day or Thursday.          \"Over the whole earth      Still is it Thor's day!\"                Saga of King Olaf (Longfellow).      Thor was considered a pre-eminently benevolent deity, and it was for  that reason that he was so widely worshipped and that temples to his  worship arose at Moeri, Hlader, Godey, Gothland, Upsala, and other  places, where the people never failed to invoke him for a favourable  year at Yule-tide, his principal festival. It was customary on this  occasion to burn a great log of oak, his sacred tree, as an emblem of  the warmth and light of summer, which would drive away the darkness  and cold of winter.    Brides invariably wore red, Thor's favourite colour, which was  considered emblematical of love, and for the same reason betrothal  rings in the North were almost always set with a red stone.    Thor's temples and statues, like Odin's, were fashioned of wood,  and the greater number of them were destroyed during the reign of  King Olaf the Saint. According to ancient chronicles, this monarch  forcibly converted his subjects. He was specially incensed against  the inhabitants of a certain province, because they worshipped a  rude image of Thor, which they decked with golden ornaments, and  before which they set food every evening, declaring the god ate it,  as no trace of it was left in the morning.    The people, being called upon in 1030 to renounce this idol in favour  of the true God, promised to consent if the morrow were cloudy;  but when after a whole night spent by Olaf in ardent prayer, there  followed a cloudy day, the obstinate people declared they were not  yet convinced of his God's power, and would only believe if the sun  shone on the next day.    Once more Olaf spent the night in prayer, but at dawn, to his  great chagrin, the sky was overcast. Nevertheless, he assembled the  people near Thor's statue, and after secretly bidding his principal  attendant to smash the idol with his battle-axe if the people turned  their eyes away but for a moment, he began to address them. Suddenly,  while all were listening to him, Olaf pointed to the horizon, where  the sun was slowly breaking its way through the clouds, and exclaimed,  \"Behold our God!\" The people one and all turned to see what he meant,  and the attendant seized this opportunity for attacking the idol,  which yielded easily to his blows, and a host of mice and other vermin  scattered hastily from its hollow interior. Seeing now that the food  placed before their god had been devoured by noxious animals only,  the people ceased to revere Thor, and definitely accepted the faith  which King Olaf had so long and vainly pressed upon them.              CHAPTER V: TYR      The God of War    Tyr Tiu, or Ziu was the son of Odin, and, according to different  mythologists, his mother was Frigga, queen of the gods, or a beautiful  giantess whose name is unknown, but who was a personification of the  raging sea. He is the god of martial honour, and one of the twelve  principal deities of Asgard. Although he appears to have had no  special dwelling there, he was always welcome to Vingolf or Valhalla,  and occupied one of the twelve thrones in the great council hall  of Glads-heim.          \"The hall Glads-heim, which is built of gold;      Where are in circle, ranged twelve golden chairs,      And in the midst one higher, Odin's Throne.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      As the God of courage and of war, Tyr was frequently invoked by the  various nations of the North, who cried to him, as well as to Odin,  to obtain victory. That he ranked next to Odin and Thor is proved  by his name, Tiu, having been given to one of the days of the week,  Tiu's day, which in modern English has become Tuesday. Under the name  of Ziu, Tyr was the principal divinity of the Suabians, who originally  called their capital, the modern Augsburg, Ziusburg. This people,  venerating the god as they did, were wont to worship him under the  emblem of a sword, his distinctive attribute, and in his honour held  great sword dances, where various figures were performed. Sometimes  the participants forming two long lines, crossed their swords, point  upward, and challenged the boldest among their number to take a flying  leap over them. At other times the warriors joined their sword points  closely together in the shape of a rose or wheel, and when this  figure was complete invited their chief to stand on the navel thus  formed of flat, shining steel blades, and then they bore him upon it  through the camp in triumph. The sword point was further considered  so sacred that it became customary to register oaths upon it.          \"... Come hither, gentlemen,      And lay your hands again upon my sword;      Never to speak of this that you have heard,      Swear by my sword.\"                Hamlet (Shakespeare).      A distinctive feature of the worship of this god among the Franks and  some other Northern nations was that the priests called Druids or Godi  offered up human sacrifices upon his altars, generally cutting the  bloody- or spread-eagle upon their victims, that is to say, making a  deep incision on either side of the back-bone, turning the ribs thus  loosened inside out, and tearing out the viscera through the opening  thus made. Of course only prisoners of war were treated thus, and it  was considered a point of honour with north European races to endure  this torture without a moan. These sacrifices were made upon rude  stone altars called dolmens, which can still be seen in Northern  Europe. As Tyr was considered the patron god of the sword, it was  deemed indispensable to engrave the sign or rune representing him  upon the blade of every sword--an observance which the Edda enjoined  upon all those who were desirous of obtaining victory.          \"Sig-runes thou must know,      If victory (sigr) thou wilt have,      And on thy sword's hilt rist them;      Some on the chapes,      Some on the guard,      And twice name the name of Tyr.\"                Lay of Sigdrifa (Thorpe's tr.).      Tyr was identical with the Saxon god Saxnot (from sax, a sword),  and with Er, Heru, or Cheru, the chief divinity of the Cheruski,  who also considered him god of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#16)"],[1,"distances. He was also too hard  for the Jews, by the Romans' skill in the art of war; although they were  bold to the utmost degree, now they durst not come to a plain battle  with the Romans, which was certain death; but through their mines under  ground they would appear in the midst of them on the sudden, and before  they could batter down one wall, they built them another in its  stead; and to sum up all at once, they did not show any want either of  painstaking or of contrivances, as having resolved to hold out to the  very last. Indeed, though they had so great an army lying round about  them, they bore a siege of five months, till some of Herod's chosen men  ventured to get upon the wall, and fell into the city, as did Sosius's  centurions after them; and now they first of all seized upon what  was about the temple; and upon the pouring in of the army, there was  slaughter of vast multitudes every where, by reason of the rage the  Romans were in at the length of this siege, and by reason that the Jews  who were about Herod earnestly endeavored that none of their adversaries  might remain; so they were cut to pieces by great multitudes, as they  were crowded together in narrow streets, and in houses, or were running  away to the temple; nor was there any mercy showed either to infants, or  to the aged, or to the weaker sex; insomuch that although the king sent  about and desired them to spare the people, nobody could be persuaded  to withhold their right hand from slaughter, but they slew people of all  ages, like madmen. Then it was that Antigonus, without any regard to his  former or to his present fortune, came down from the citadel, and fell  at Sosius's feet, who without pitying him at all, upon the change of his  condition, laughed at him beyond measure, and called him Antigona. 26  Yet did he not treat him like a woman, or let him go free, but put him  into bonds, and kept him in custody.    3. But Herod's concern at present, now he had gotten his enemies under  his power, was to restrain the zeal of his foreign auxiliaries; for the  multitude of the strange people were very eager to see the temple, and  what was sacred in the holy house itself; but the king endeavored to  restrain them, partly by his exhortations, partly by his threatenings,  nay, partly by force, as thinking the victory worse than a defeat to  him, if any thing that ought not to be seen were seen by them. He also  forbade, at the same time, the spoiling of the city, asking Sosius in  the most earnest manner, whether the Romans, by thus emptying the city  of money and men, had a mind to leave him king of a desert,--and told  him that he judged the dominion of the habitable earth too small a  compensation for the slaughter of so many citizens. And when Sosius said  that it was but just to allow the soldiers this plunder as a reward for  what they suffered during the siege, Herod made answer, that he would  give every one of the soldiers a reward out of his own money. So he  purchased the deliverance of his country, and performed his promises to  them, and made presents after a magnificent manner to each soldier,  and proportionably to their commanders, and with a most royal bounty  to Sosius himself, whereby nobody went away but in a wealthy condition.  Hereupon Sosius dedicated a crown of gold to God, and then went away  from Jerusalem, leading Antigonus away in bonds to Antony; then did the  axe bring him to his end, 27 who still had a fond desire of life, and  some frigid hopes of it to the last, but by his cowardly behavior well  deserved to die by it.    4. Hereupon king Herod distinguished the multitude that was in the city;  and for those that were of his side, he made them still more his friends  by the honors he conferred on them; but for those of Antigonus's party,  he slew them; and as his money ran low, he turned all the ornaments he  had into money, and sent it to Antony, and to those about him. Yet could  he not hereby purchase an exemption from all sufferings; for Antony was  now bewitched by his love to Cleopatra, and was entirely conquered by  her charms. Now Cleopatra had put to death all her kindred, till no  one near her in blood remained alive, and after that she fell a slaying  those no way related to her. So she calumniated the principal men among  the Syrians to Antony, and persuaded him to have them slain, that so she  might easily gain to be mistress of what they had; nay, she extended her  avaricious humor to the Jews and Arabians, and secretly labored to have  Herod and Malichus, the kings of both those nations, slain by his order.    5. Now is to these her injunctions to Antony, he complied in part; for  though he esteemed it too abominable a thing to kill such good and great  kings, yet was he thereby alienated from the friendship he had for  them. He also took away a great deal of their country; nay, even the  plantation of palm trees at Jericho, where also grows the balsam tree,  and bestowed them upon her; as also all the cities on this side the  river Eleutherus, Tyre and Sidon 28 excepted. And when she was become  mistress of these, and had conducted Antony in his expedition against  the Parthians as far as Euphrates, she came by Apamia and Damascus  into Judea and there did Herod pacify her indignation at him by large  presents. He also hired of her those places that had been torn away from  his kingdom, at the yearly rent of two hundred talents. He conducted her  also as far as Pelusium, and paid her all the respects possible. Now it  was not long after this that Antony was come back from Parthia, and led  with him Artabazes, Tigranes's son, captive, as a present for Cleopatra;  for this Parthian was presently given her, with his money, and all the  prey that was taken with him.              CHAPTER 19.           How Antony At The Persuasion Of Cleopatra Sent Herod To       Fight Against The Arabians; And Now After Several Battles,       He At Length Got The Victory. As Also Concerning A Great       Earthquake.    1. Now when the war about Actium was begun, Herod prepared to come to  the assistance of Antony, as being already freed from his troubles in  Judea, and having gained Hyrcania, which was a place that was held by  Antigonus's sister. However, he was cunningly hindered from partaking of  the hazards that Antony went through by Cleopatra; for since, as we  have already noted, she had laid a plot against the kings [of Judea  and Arabia], she prevailed with Antony to commit the war against the  Arabians to Herod; that so, if he got the better, she might become  mistress of Arabia, or, if he were worsted, of Judea; and that she might  destroy one of those kings by the other.    2. However, this contrivance tended to the advantage of Herod; for at  the very first he took hostages from the enemy, and got together a great  body of horse, and ordered them to march against them about Diespous;  and he conquered that army, although it fought resolutely against him.  After which defeat, the Arabians were in great motion, and assembled  themselves together at Kanatha, a city of Celesyria, in vast multitudes,  and waited for the Jews. And when Herod was come thither, he tried to  manage this war with particular prudence, and gave orders that they  should build a wall about their camp; yet did not the multitude comply  with those orders, but were so emboldened by their foregoing victory,  that they presently attacked the Arabians, and beat them at the first  onset, and then pursued them; yet were there snares laid for Herod in  that pursuit; while Athenio, who was one of Cleopatra's generals, and  always an antagonist to Herod, sent out of Kanatha the men of that  country against him; for, upon this fresh onset, the Arabians took  courage, and returned back, and both joined their numerous forces about  stony places, that were hard to be gone over, and there put Herod's men  to the rout, and made a great slaughter of them; but those that escaped  out of the battle fled to Ormiza, where the Arabians surrounded their  camp, and took it, with all the men in it. 3. In a little time after  this calamity, Herod came to bring them succors; but he came too late.  Now the occasion of that blow was this, that the officers would not obey  orders; for had not the fight begun so suddenly, Athenio had not found  a proper season for the snares he laid for Herod: however, he was even  with the Arabians afterward, and overran their country, and did them  more harm than their single victory could compensate. But as he  was avenging himself on his enemies, there fell upon him another  providential calamity; for in the seventh 29 year of his reign, when the  war about Actium was at the height, at the beginning of the spring, the  earth was shaken, and destroyed an immense number of cattle, with thirty  thousand men; but the army received no harm, because it lay in the open  air. In the mean time, the fame of this earthquake elevated the Arabians  to greater courage, and this by augmenting it to a fabulous height, as  is constantly the case in melancholy accidents, and pretending that all  Judea was overthrown. Upon this supposal, therefore, that they should  easily get a land that was destitute of inhabitants into their power,  they first sacrificed those ambassadors who were come to them from the  Jews, and then marched into Judea immediately. Now the Jewish nation  were affrighted at this invasion, and quite dispirited at the greatness  of their calamities one after another; whom yet Herod got together, and  endeavored to encourage to defend themselves by the following speech  which he made to them:    4. \"The present dread you are under seems to me to have seized upon  you very unreasonably. It is true, you might justly be dismayed at  that providential chastisement which hath befallen you; but to suffer  yourselves to be equally terrified at the invasion of men is unmanly. As  for myself, I am so far from being"]]]
