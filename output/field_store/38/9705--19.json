On the other  hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one  myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as  you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have  found no cut underneath it.    \"Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then  get away where I could be joined by my 'widow' we should have a chance  at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils would  give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in the  papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all my  troubles. I hadn't much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my  wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all about  this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to connect  it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the  rest.    \"I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the  window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer  escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up there was  no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the bell for all  he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so, gentlemen, you  can do what you please; but I've told you the truth and the whole truth,  so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand by the English  law?\"    There was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.    \"The English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than  your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this  man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to  hide to get you?\"    \"I know nothing of this.\"    Holmes's face was very white and grave. \"The story is not over yet, I  fear,\" said he. \"You may find worse dangers than the English law, or  even than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr.  Douglas. You'll take my advice and still be on your guard.\"    And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me  for a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also  from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended  with the strange story of the man who had been known as John Douglas.  I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and westward some  thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular and  terrible narrative--so singular and so terrible that you may find it  hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it occur.    Do not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. As  you read on you will find that this is not so. And when I have detailed  those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we  shall meet once more in those rooms on Baker Street, where this, like so  many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.            Part 2--The Scowrers          Chapter 1--The Man        It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe  winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.  The steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening  train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working  settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which  lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which  lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps  downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural  county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at every  siding--and they were numerous--long lines of trucks piled with coal and  iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population  and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of  America.    For desolate it was! Little could the first pioneer who had traversed  it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water  pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and  tangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon  their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and  jagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous  valley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling.    The oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long,  bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The  greater number of these were workmen returning from their day's toil in  the lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces  and the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves  miners. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices,  glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose  uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen.    Several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might  have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company, with  the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It is with this  man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him; for he is worth it.    He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would  guess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray eyes  which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through  his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that he is of  a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to  all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and  communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. And yet  the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness  of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there  were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman  might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to  which he was introduced.    Having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and  receiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to  uncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading  landscape.    It was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed  the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of  slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts  of the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden  houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in  light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent  halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.    The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for  the leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the  crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong  workers who did it.    The young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of  mingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to  him. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he  referred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once from  the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have  expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It was  a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to the  light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum  showed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret  pocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had  seated himself upon the adjoining bench.    \"Hullo, mate!\" said he. \"You seem heeled and ready.\"    The young man smiled with an air of embarrassment.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"we need them sometimes in the place I come from.\"    \"And where may that be?\"    \"I'm last from Chicago.\"    \"A stranger in these parts?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You may find you need it here,\" said the workman.    \"Ah! is that so?\" The young man seemed interested.    \"Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?\"    \"Nothing out of the way.\"    \"Why, I thought the country was full of it. You'll hear quick enough.  What made you come here?\"    \"I heard there was always work for a willing man.\"    \"Are you a member of the union?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Then you'll get your job, I guess. Have you any friends?\"    \"Not yet; but I have the means of making them.\"    \"How's that, then?\"    \"I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen. There's no town without a  lodge, and where there is a lodge I'll find my friends.\"    The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round  suspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering  among themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across,  seated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.    \"Put it there,\" he said.    A hand-grip passed between the two.    \"I see you speak the truth,\" said the workman. \"But it's well to make  certain.\" He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller  at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.    \"Dark nights are unpleasant,\" said the workman.    \"Yes, for strangers to travel,\" the other answered.    \"That's good enough. I'm Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley.  Glad to see you in these parts.\"    \"Thank you. I'm Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J.H.  Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.\"    \"Well, there are plenty of us about. You won't find the order more  flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley.  But we could do with some lads like you. I can't understand a spry man  of the union finding no work to do in Chicago.\"    \"I found plenty of work to do,\" said McMurdo.    \"Then why did you leave?\"    McMurdo nodded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#16)"],[1,"goal ought to  be as to discover the best route thereto--often, indeed, through the  welcome stimulus which a clash of views gave to his reasoning powers.       * This was in the case of Ogden vs. Saunders, 12 Wheaton, 213  (1827).      Though the wealth of available legal talent at this period was  impressively illustrated in connection both with Chase's impeachment and  with Burr's trial, yet on neither of these occasions appeared William  Pinkney of Maryland, the attorney to whom Marshall acknowledged his  greatest indebtedness, and who was universally acknowledged to be the  leader of the American Bar from 1810 until his death twelve years later.  Besides being a great lawyer, Pinkney was also a notable personality, as  George Ticknor's sketch of him as he appeared before the Supreme Court  in 1815 goes to prove:    \"You must imagine, if you can, a man formed on nature's most liberal  scale, who at the age of 50 is possessed with the ambition of being a  pretty fellow, wears corsets to diminish his bulk, uses cosmetics, as  he told Mrs. Gore, to smooth and soften a skin growing somewhat wrinkled  and rigid with age, dresses in a style which would be thought foppish  in a much younger man. You must imagine such a man standing before  the gravest tribunal in the land, and engaged in causes of the deepest  moment; but still apparently thinking how he can declaim like a  practised rhetorician in the London Cockpit, which he used to frequent.  Yet you must, at the same time, imagine his declamation to be chaste and  precise in its language and cogent, logical and learned in its argument,  free from the artifice and affectation of his manner, and in short,  opposite to what you might fairly have expected from his first  appearance and tones. And when you have compounded these inconsistencies  in your imagination, and united qualities which on common occasions  nature seems to hold asunder, you will, perhaps, begin to form some idea  of what Mr. Pinkney is.\"    Such was the man whom Marshall, Story, and Taney all considered the  greatest lawyer who had ever appeared before the Supreme Court.    At the close of the War of 1812, Marshall, though he had decided many  important questions of International Law, * nevertheless found himself  only at the threshold of his real fame. Yet even thus early he had  indicated his point of view. Thus in the case of the United States vs.  Peters, * * which was decided in 1809, the question before the Court was  whether a mandamus should issue to the United States District Judge of  Pennsylvania ordering him to enforce, in the face of the opposition of  the state Government, a decision handed down in a prize case more than  thirty years before by the old Committee of Appeals of the Continental  Congress. Marshall answered the question affirmatively, saying: \"If the  legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of  the courts of the United States and destroy the rights acquired under  those judgments, the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery,  and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the  instrumentality of its own tribunals.\"       * Two famous decisions of Marshall's in this field are those in  the Schooner Exchange vs. McFaddon et al, 7 Cranch, 116, and the case of  the Nereide, 9 ib., 388.       * * 5 Cranch, 136.      Marshall's decision evoked a warm protest from the Pennsylvania  Legislature and led to a proposal of amendment to the Constitution  providing \"an impartial tribunal\" between the General Government and the  States; and these expressions of dissent in turn brought the Virginia  Assembly to the defense of the Supreme Court.    \"The commission to whom was referred the communication of the governor  of Pennsylvania [reads the Virginia document]... are of the opinion that  a tribunal is already provided by the Constitution of the United States,  to wit; the Supreme Court, more eminently qualified from their habits  and duties, from the mode of their selection, and from the tenure of  their offices, to decide the disputes aforesaid in an enlightened and  impartial manner than any other tribunal which could be created.    \"The members of the Supreme Court are selected from those in the United  States who are most celebrated for virtue and legal Learning.... The  duties they have to perform lead them necessarily to the most enlarged  and accurate acquaintance with the jurisdiction of the federal and  several State courts together, and with the admirable symmetry of our  government. The tenure of their offices enables them to pronounce the  sound and correct opinions they have formed, without fear, favor or  partiality.\"    Was it coincidence or something more that during Marshall's incumbency  Virginia paid her one and only tribute to the impartiality of the  Supreme Court while Burr's acquittal was still vivid in the minds  of all? Or was it due to the fact that \"the Great Lama of the  Little Mountain\"--to use Marshall's disrespectful appellation for  Jefferson--had not yet converted the Virginia Court of Appeals into  the angry oracle of his own unrelenting hatred of the Chief Justice?  Whatever the reason, within five years Virginia's attitude had again  shifted, and she had become once more what she had been in 1798-99, the  rallying point of the forces of Confederation and State Rights.        CHAPTER V. The Tenets Of Nationalism    \"John Marshall stands in history as one of that small group of men who  have founded States. He was a nation-maker, a state-builder. His monument  is in the history of the United States and his name is written upon the  Constitution of his country.\" So spoke Senator Lodge, on John Marshall  Day, February 4, 1901. \"I should feel a... doubt,\" declared Justice  Holmes on the same occasion, \"whether, after Hamilton and the  Constitution itself, Marshall's work proved more than a strong  intellect, a good style, personal ascendancy in his court, courage,  justice, and the convictions of his party.\" Both these divergent  estimates of the great Chief Justice have their value. It is well to  be reminded that Marshall's task lay within the four corners of the  Constitution, whose purposes he did not originate, especially since  no one would have been quicker than himself to disown praise implying  anything different. None the less it was no ordinary skill and courage  which, assisted by great office, gave enduring definition to the  purposes of the Constitution at the very time when the whole trend of  public opinion was setting in most strongly against them. It must not  be forgotten that Hamilton, whose name Justice Holmes invokes in  his somewhat too grudging encomium of Marshall, had pronounced the  Constitution \"a frail and worthless fabric.\"    Marshall's own outlook upon his task sprang in great part from a  profound conviction of calling. He was thoroughly persuaded that he knew  the intentions of the framers of the Constitution--the intentions  which had been wrought into the instrument itself--and he was equally  determined that these intentions should prevail. For this reason he  refused to regard his office merely as a judicial tribunal; it was a  platform from which to promulgate sound constitutional principles, the  very cathedra indeed of constitutional orthodoxy. Not one of the cases  which elicited his great opinions but might easily have been decided  on comparatively narrow grounds in precisely the same way in which he  decided it on broad, general principles, but with the probable result  that it would never again have been heard of outside the law courts. To  take a timid or obscure way to a merely tentative goal would have been  at variance equally with Marshall's belief in his mission and with his  instincts as a great debater. Hence he forged his weapon--the obiter  dictum--by whose broad strokes was hewn the highroad of a national  destiny.    Marshall's task naturally was not performed in vacuo: he owed much  to the preconceptions of his contemporaries. His invariable quest, as  students of his opinions are soon aware, was for the axiomatic, for  absolute principles, and in this inquiry he met the intellectual demands  of a period whose first minds still owned the sway of the syllogism and  still loved what Bacon called the \"spacious liberty of generalities.\" In  Marshall's method--as in the older syllogistic logic, whose phraseology  begins to sound somewhat strange to twentieth century ears--the  essential operation consisted in eliminating the \"accidental\" or  \"irrelevant\" elements from the \"significant\" facts of a case, and then  recognizing that this particular case had been foreseen and provided for  in a general rule of law. Proceeding in this way Marshall was able to  build up a body of thought the internal consistency of which, even  when it did not convince, yet baffled the only sort of criticism which  contemporaries were disposed to apply. Listen, for instance, to the  despairing cry of John Randolph of Roanoke: \"All wrong,\" said he of one  of Marshall's opinions, \"all wrong, but no man in the United States can  tell why or wherein.\"    Marshall found his first opportunity to elaborate the tenets of his  nationalistic creed in the case of M'Culloch vs. Maryland, which was  decided at the same term with the Dartmouth College case and that of  Sturges vs. Crowinshield--the greatest six weeks in the history of  the Court. The question immediately involved was whether the State of  Maryland had the right to tax the notes issued by the branch which the  Bank of the United States had recently established at Baltimore. But  this question raised the further one whether the United States had in  the first place the right to charter the Bank and to authorize it  to establish branches within the States. The outcome turned on the  interpretation to be given the \"necessary and proper\" clause of the  Constitution.    The last two questions were in 1819 by no"]]]
