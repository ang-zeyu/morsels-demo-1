[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#16)"],[1," thrill of discomfort. After all, he thought, vaguely,  very likely this unaccustomed night walk was all part of the Show  and its many novel experiences. There had been night walks at the  end of each show day. When Finn had had another morsel of the meat,  the friendly stranger put another collar on his neck, and removed  the green one. Then he began to trot, and Finn trotted with him,  quite contentedly. Finn was always glad to run.    So the two trotted for miles, through the mild, still October  night, the man breathing heavily. Once something made Finn pause  suddenly; and the pause let him into a secret. The collar he was  wearing now was different from any other he had known in his short  life. If you pulled against it, it slipped round your throat so  tightly as to stop your breathing instantly and absolutely. The  only thing to do was to go the way the collar and lead pulled;  then, immediately, the pressure relaxed. It was a collar that had  to be obeyed, that was evident. These \"slip-collars\" are well known  to some members of the Great Dane family, and particularly to those  who are owned by dealers; but their use came with rather a shock to  lordly young Finn, who, living the free and happy life he always  had lived, there beside the Sussex Downs, had rarely been asked to  wear a collar of any sort.    After a time, Finn and the stranger came to a little town, and  walked into the yard of an inn. There another man met them, to whom  Finn's friend said, hurriedly--    \"I'll walk straight on. You drive on with the cart after me. Don't  stop till you're clear of the village.\"    \"You've got him, then?\" said the second man.    \"Never you mind about that. Can't yer see I've got him? You get the  pony out.\"    And then Finn followed his leader out of the yard, and through the  quiet little village to the open country beyond. But by this time  Finn was beginning to feel that the night walk had been prolonged  far enough. There was no sign of any more of the aromatic meat  coming his way, and he had given up asking for it, and nosing the  man's pocket. He thought he would like to turn now, and get back to  Kathleen and Tara and the Master. The day, and its immediate  predecessors, had been tiring, and Finn thought with strong desire  of his fragrant wheaten straw bed in the coach-house at home. Yes,  it was certainly time to return.    Accordingly, Finn asked his leader to stop, and, finding that the  man took no notice, he asked again, through his nose, and urgently.  The man paid not the slightest heed to this, and that rather  angered Finn, who was not accustomed to being ignored; so he  planted his fore-feet firmly, and stopped dead. As the lead  tightened, the slip-collar pressed painfully on Finn's throat; but  he felt that the time had arrived to bring this excursion to an  end, and so steeled himself to ignore this pressure.    \"None o' that, now!\" said the man, with a new note in his voice, of  extreme harshness. \"Come along now; d'ye hear!\"    Finn's fore-legs remained rigid. He had made up his mind now, and  already he was beginning to regret having stayed so long with this  stranger.    The man now gave a powerful tug at the leather lead, and at that  the pressure of the slip-collar forced Finn's tongue out between  his teeth. This was really painful, but it was clear in Finn's mind  that he must go home, so he remained straining backward.    \"Come on 'ere, ye brute!\" growled the man savagely, and, with a  vicious jerk at the lead, he took a step to one side, and then  kicked Finn on the hind-quarters as hard as he could. That was the  first real blow Finn had ever received, and it taught him quite a  lot. Up till this point it had not occurred to him for a moment  that the man entertained any other than kindly, friendly feelings  for him. In fact, he supposed that every one entertained kindly  feelings towards him. He had never experienced any other sort of  attitude. But this savage kick was a revelation to him. Also, it  hurt. Finn turned in his tracks and plunged forward in the  direction from which, they had come with such sudden strength that  he almost dragged the lead from the man's strong hand, and would  undoubtedly have freed himself, but for the slip-collar. As it was,  the sudden jerk nearly throttled Finn, and brought him rolling on  his back with all four feet in the air. Before he could rise again,  the man had planted two ferocious kicks on his ribs; and Finn was  thankful then to draw a free breath by moving towards his  persecutor, so as to slacken the pressure on the lead. But, the  moment he had drawn breath, the desire to escape possessed him once  more, and he repeated his leap for freedom. This time the man was  prepared, and, in addition to the pressure brought about by Finn's  reaching the end of his tether, there was the savage extra pressure  of a quick backward jerk at the lead, to bring the hound on his  back a second time. This time the man kicked him very severely,  and, in addition, smote him violently on the nose with clenched  fist, as he staggered to his feet, gasping for breath.    Just then the dim, smoky lights of a cart appeared at the bend in  the road, twenty yards away, in the direction of the village.    \"That you, Bill?\" cried the man who held Finn, and an affirmative  answer reached him from the cart. \"Come on, then, and let's get  this stubborn beast into the cart.\" He gave a savage jerk at Finn's  slip-collar as he spoke, and once more his nailed boot crashed  against the bewildered Wolfhound's ribs. The man had an itch of  anger and brutality upon him by this time. Finn leaped sideways  with a quick gasp as the man's boot struck him and the cruel collar  tightened; and at this sharp movement of his great body, there in  the middle of the road, the pony shied violently, just as it was  being drawn in to a standstill; the cart swerved sharply into the  hedge, and a cracking sound betrayed the breaking of a shaft.    This was the finishing touch required to round off the naturally  vicious temper of the man who held Finn into a passion of sullen,  brutal anger. He cursed unceasingly while the man in the cart made  the necessary repairs with cord and a couple of sticks from the  hedge; and with every curse there was a kick, or a vicious blow, or  a savage jerk at the torturing slip-collar, and sometimes all three  together. Finn could have killed the man with ease; but, so far,  the thought of even biting him never occurred to the Wolfhound.  Every hour that he had spent in the world had taught him that  humans were his friends, his very kindly protectors, his guardians  and governors, so to say. Every hour of his mother's life, with but  very few exceptions, had borne the same belief in upon her, and her  nature was the sweetest and gentlest imaginable. With his father,  now, the case was somewhat otherwise. There were those who said  that the rather taciturn and shy Dermot owed some of his  wonderfully heavy coat to the mesalliance of a forbear of his with  a Tibetan Sheep Dog of a half-wild sort, with a temper far from  reliable. But, as yet at all events, Finn's temper was that of a  clean run, well-bred English boy; frank, open, trusting, and  kindly; and, sorely as he ached, sorely bewildered as he felt under  the rain of blows and kicks, curses and strangling tugs at his  collar, he had as yet no thought of vengeance. His only desire was  for escape, and a return to the sweet, free life he knew beside the  Downs.    The man who held Finn instinctively recognised all this, and the  knowledge whetted the savagery of his temper, and withdrew all  restraint from its cruel indulgence. He had no conscious wish to  injure the hound; quite the contrary, since Finn represented money  to him, and money was what he desired more than anything else; but  he was tired, things seemed to be going ill with him, his temper  was thoroughly roused, and the innocent cause of all this, a  sensitive, living creature, was tethered and helpless beside him;  and so he kicked and cursed, and jerked at the lead, and found  relief in Finn's gasps of pain and want of breath.    When the shaft was mended, the tail-board of the little cart was  let down, and, with a savage kick at Finn's hind-quarters, the man  bade him \"Get up, there, ---- ye! Get up, ye brute!\" Another kick.  Poor Finn tried to squirm forward under the cart to escape the  heavy boot of his persecutor. Then he was furiously jerked backward  and half throttled.    \"Steady with 'im, matey,\" said the other man. \"Don't knock the  dollars off of 'im.\"    \"Who asked you to shove your jaw in?\" snarled the first man. \"You  didn't get the brute, did ye--curse him!\"    Another kick.    The other man was used to his friend's temper, and said nothing;  but he hated to see a valuable animal knocked about, just as he  would have hated to see money thrown in the gutter instead of into  a publican's till; so he stooped down and lifted Finn's fore-feet  from the ground, and placed them on the floor of the cart.    \"My oath!\" he said, \"but 'e's a tidy weight, ain't he? Up ye go, my  bully boy!\" And up Finn went, on the spur of another violent kick,  which broke the skin across one of his hocks. The lead was now  fastened close down to a staple in the floor of the cart, Finn  being forced down on his side by the simple process of being knelt  upon by his persecutor. To make doubly sure of him, his fore-legs  were then tightly lashed together with his own green collar; and  then the two men mounted the front of the cart and drove off.    The memory of that night's drive burnt itself deep into Finn's  young mind. He never really forgot it; that is to say, its effect  upon his attitude toward men and life was never completely lost.  His skin was broken in three or four places; every bone in his body  ached from the heavy kicks he had received; an intolerable thirst  kept him gasping for every breath he drew; the cramp set up "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#16)"],[1,"for the second part to treat the  motive in _inverted_ form. The example cited from Bach's Fifth French  Suite (see Supplement No. 32) is unsurpassed for rhythmic energy; the  closing measures sound as if all the bells of heaven were ringing. The  example of Mozart (see Supplement No. 33) is noteworthy for its daring  use of the dissonant element and for its free modulations. Of the  counterparts of the gigue the following are excellent examples: The  Rigaudon--the Finale of Grieg's _Holberg Suite_, the vigorous one from  Rameau's opera _Dardanus_, and MacDowell's independent piece in this  form, op. 49, No. 2; the Furiant--the Finale of Dvo[vr]ak's _Suite for  Small Orchestra_, op. 30 (accessible in an effective pianoforte  arrangement for four hands); the _Tarantelle_--Chopin's independent  piece in this rhythm, op. 43, and the brilliant Finale of  Rheinberger's Pianoforte Sonata for four hands, op. 122; the  Saltarello--the last movement of Mendelssohn's _Italian Symphony_ and  the main portion of Berlioz's _Carnaval Romain Overture_. One  additional example is cited (see Supplement No. 34), a Courante by D.  Scarlatti, to give an example of his pianoforte style. In connection  with these dances, especially the Sarabande, Gavotte, Loure, Pavane,  Polonaise and Tarantelle, there should be read the articles treating  of each dance in Grove's Dictionary; for these dances are so closely  connected with human activity that a knowledge of their development  broadens our horizon in many matters pertaining to social life and  civilization in general. As to specific examples of the less usual  dances, many of the quaintest are found in the works of the early  English composers: Byrd, Bull, etc., in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book,  _e.g._, _The Lord of Salisbury his Pavan_. An excellent example of the  Loure is the well-known arrangement from Bach's third 'Cello sonata.  Chopin, in his works, has glorified both the Polonaise and the  Mazurka; Bizet, in his opera Carmen, has used the Habanera and the  Seguidilla, and there is a wonderful use of the Habanera rhythm in  Debussy's descriptive piece _Soiree dans Grenade_. The French composer  Ravel in his pianoforte piece _Pavane pour un enfant defunt_ has used  with remarkable effect the stately rhythm of that dance. The Spanish  composers, Albeniz and Granados, frequently employ national dance  rhythms in their pieces. The French composer Chabrier's _Bourree  Fantasque_ is a dazzling modernization of the old form; and his  _Espana_ for full orchestra fairly intoxicates us with its dashing  rhythms based upon the Jota and the Malaguena.[75] Debussy's  well-known piece _Hommage a Rameau_ is in the style of the Sarabande.  The allusions in literature to these dances are so frequent that only  a few can be cited. The very spirit of the Jig is given in Pope's line  \"Make the soul dance upon a jig to Heaven.\" In speaking of the antics  of Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night, Shakespeare remarks--\"I did  think by the excellent constitution of thy leg that it was formed  under the star of a Galliard.\" One of the most remarkable works of the  English composer John Dowland (born 1562) is entitled _Lachrymae, or  Seven Teares, figured in seven passionate Pavans_.    [Footnote 75: For a vivid description of these dances see Chabrier's  _Lettres a Nanette_, Paris, 1910.]    The Suite, by reason of its freedom in combining different rhythms and  moods, has appealed vividly to modern composers; and the literature of  our times contains a number of Suites which should be known to the  music-lover. In these modern Suites no attempt is made to conform to  the old conventional grouping of dances. The movements are in  different keys, are often based on rhythms of an exotic or  ultra-nationalistic type--as in Tchaikowsky and Dvo[vr]ak, or may  employ any material suggested by the fantastic imagination of the  composer--as in Debussy and Ravel. Among the most attractive modern  Suites may be cited: The _Peer Gynt_ (put together from incidental  music to Ibsen's play) and the _Holberg_ by Grieg; the two  _L'Arlesienne Suites_ by Bizet (written to illustrate Daudet's  romantic story)--the first, with its dainty Minuet and brilliant  Carillons (Peal of bells); Dvo[vr]ak's _Suite for Small Orchestra_,  op. 39, with its sprightly Polka and impassioned Furiant;  Tchaikowsky's five Orchestral Suites of which the best known are the  _Casse-Noisette_ with its exotic rhythms and novel orchestral effects,  the _Mozartiana_ and the third which closes with a brilliant  Polonaise; Brahms's _Serenades_ for orchestra; Charpentier's  _Impressions of Italy_ in which there is an effective use of Italian  rhythm and color; MacDowell's _Indian Suite_, with several of the  themes based on native tunes; the fascinating orchestral Suite  _Adventures in a Perambulator_ by John Alden Carpenter; Arthur  Whiting's _Suite Moderne_ for pianoforte; _Stevensoniana_, (based on  stanzas from Stevenson's _Child's Garden of Verses_) an orchestral  Suite in four movements by Edward B. Hill; Debussy's _Suite  Bergamasque_ in which is found the oft-played _Clair de Lune_;  Ravel's[76] _Mother Goose_, a delightful work--and by the same  composer the _Daphnis and Chloe_ Suite, the material drawn from an  opera of the same name. In modern literature easily the most  celebrated and brilliant example of this type is the _Scheherazade  Suite_ (based on the Arabian Nights) for full orchestra by  Rimsky-Korsakoff. This work in the genuine poetic quality of its  themes, in its marvellous descriptive power and in the boldness of its  orchestral effect remains unsurpassed.    [Footnote 76: See also _Le Tombeau de Couperin_ in which is a very  novel Rigaudon.]          CHAPTER VII    THE OLDER RONDO FORM      One of the earliest instrumental forms to be worked out[77] was the  Rondo, which is merely an extension of the _three-part_ principle of  \"restatement after contrast\" and which, by reason of its logical  appeal, has retained its place to this day. Originally the Rondo was a  combination of dance and song; that is, the performers sang and danced  in a circle--holding one another's hands. The music would begin with a  chorus in which all joined, one of the dancers would then sing a solo,  after which all would dance about and repeat the chorus; other solos  would follow, the chorus being repeated after each. The characteristic  feature, then, of this structure is the _continual recurrence_ to a  principal motive after intervening contrasts--hence the name Rondo  (French, Rondeau); exemplifying a principle found not only in  primitive folk-songs and dances but in literature, _e.g._, many of the  songs of Burns and the Rondeaux of Austin Dobson. For it is obvious  that the form answers to the simplest requirements of unity and  contrast. Frequent examples of the Rondo are found in all early  instrumental composers: Bach, _e.g._, the charming one in C minor in  his third Partita; Couperin, Rameau, Haydn and Mozart. It is found  also in vocal works, _e.g._, Purcell's well-known song \"I Attempt from  Love's Sickness to Fly.\" From the standpoint of modern taste, however,  Beethoven was--with few exceptions--the first to treat the form with  real genius; and so our illustrations are taken chiefly from his  works and from those of his successors. Although there need be no  arbitrary limit to the alternation of the chief part with the  subsidiary portions--in fact, Beethoven's humorous _Rondo Capriccio,  On a Lost Farthing_ has as many as _eleven_ sections--it gradually  became conventional for the form to consist of _five parts_: a first  presentation and two repetitions of the main theme together with two  contrasting portions called _Episodes_, to which a free Coda was often  added. The form would then be A, b, A', c, A'', Coda--A' and A''  indicating that the repetition need not be _literal_, but often varied  rhythmically and harmonically; not, however, so as to obliterate the  original outline. For in a well-constructed Rondo the main theme must  be one of such direct appeal that we _look forward_ to hearing it  _again_; and the successive repetitions must be so planned that we can  easily enjoy this pleasure of reminiscence. It also became customary  not to block off the sections with rigid cadences but often to insert  modulatory passages, thus securing a continuous flow of thought. This  practise we see particularly in Beethoven and Schumann. The form which  we are discussing is the so-called Older Rondo Form, clearly derived  from the dance described above. Beginning[78] with Beethoven, however,  we find numerous examples of a different kind of rondo treatment which  developed in connection with the Sonata Form--to be explained later.  The Rondo-Sonata Form, as it is generally called, is in fact a hybrid  type, with certain features derived from rondo structure and certain  from the pure sonata form. The Finales to Beethoven's Sonatas, when  entitled Rondos, are--with few exceptions--of this Rondo-Sonata type.  An excellent example, which should be well known, is the Finale of the  Sonata Pathetique. Although there are many cases of _free_ treatment  of the rondo principle, they are all based on one or the other of  these two fundamental types. Schumann was extremely fond of this Older  Rondo Form, as may be seen from his frequent practice of writing two  Trios to the Scherzos of his Symphonies. A moment's thought will make  clear that a Scherzo with two Trios and the customary repetitions will  conform exactly to the pattern given above, _i.e._, A, b, A', c, A''  Coda, _e.g._, Scherzo, First Trio = First Episode, First return,  Second Trio = Second Episode, Final return and Coda--five portions in  all, or six when there is a Coda. For convincing examples see the  Scherzos of the First and Second Symphonies. Schumann's well-known  _Arabesque_ for pianoforte, op. 18, is a beautiful, clear-cut example  of the form; with an"]]]
