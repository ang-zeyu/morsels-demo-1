Far from thee, son of Aegeus, be such fate!  But to the spot--the god within me goads--  Let us set forth no longer hesitate.  Follow me, daughters, this way.  Strange that I  Whom you have led so long should lead you now.  Oh, touch me not, but let me all alone  Find out the sepulcher that destiny  Appoints me in this land.  Hither, this way,  For this way Hermes leads, the spirit guide,  And Persephassa, empress of the dead.  O light, no light to me, but mine erewhile,  Now the last time I feel thee palpable,  For I am drawing near the final gloom  Of Hades.  Blessing on thee, dearest friend,  On thee and on thy land and followers!  Live prosperous and in your happy state  Still for your welfare think on me, the dead.  [Exit THESEUS followed by ANTIGONE and ISMENE]    CHORUS  (Str.)            If mortal prayers are heard in hell,            Hear, Goddess dread, invisible!            Monarch of the regions drear,                 Aidoneus, hear, O hear!            By a gentle, tearless doom            Speed this stranger to the gloom,            Let him enter without pain            The all-shrouding Stygian plain.            Wrongfully in life oppressed,            Be he now by Justice blessed.    (Ant.)            Queen infernal, and thou fell            Watch-dog of the gates of hell,            Who, as legends tell, dost glare,            Gnarling in thy cavernous lair            At all comers, let him go            Scathless to the fields below.            For thy master orders thus,            The son of earth and Tartarus;            In his den the monster keep,            Giver of eternal sleep.  [Enter MESSENGER]    MESSENGER  Friends, countrymen, my tidings are in sum  That Oedipus is gone, but the event  Was not so brief, nor can the tale be brief.    CHORUS  What, has he gone, the unhappy man?    MESSENGER                                     Know well  That he has passed away from life to death.    CHORUS  How?  By a god-sent, painless doom, poor soul?    MESSENGER  Thy question hits the marvel of the tale.  How he moved hence, you saw him and must know;  Without a friend to lead the way, himself  Guiding us all.  So having reached the abrupt  Earth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,  He paused at one of the converging paths,  Hard by the rocky basin which records  The pact of Theseus and Peirithous.  Betwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,  The hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,  Midway he sat and loosed his beggar's weeds;  Then calling to his daughters bade them fetch  Of running water, both to wash withal  And make libation; so they clomb the steep;  And in brief space brought what their father bade,  Then laved and dressed him with observance due.  But when he had his will in everything,  And no desire was left unsatisfied,  It thundered from the netherworld; the maids  Shivered, and crouching at their father's knees  Wept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.  He, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,  Folded his arms about them both and said,  \"My children, ye will lose your sire today,  For all of me has perished, and no more  Have ye to bear your long, long ministry;  A heavy load, I know, and yet one word  Wipes out all score of tribulations--_love_.  And love from me ye had--from no man more;  But now must live without me all your days.\"  So clinging to each other sobbed and wept  Father and daughters both, but when at last  Their mourning had an end and no wail rose,  A moment there was silence; suddenly  A voice that summoned him; with sudden dread  The hair of all stood up and all were 'mazed;  For the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.  \"Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?  Too long, too long thy passing is delayed.\"  But when he heard the summons of the god,  He prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when  The Prince came nearer:  \"O my friend,\" he cried,  \"Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand--  And, daughters, give him yours--and promise me  Thou never wilt forsake them, but do all  That time and friendship prompt in their behoof.\"  And he of his nobility repressed  His tears and swore to be their constant friend.  This promise given, Oedipus put forth  Blind hands and laid them on his children, saying,  \"O children, prove your true nobility  And hence depart nor seek to witness sights  Unlawful or to hear unlawful words.  Nay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,  Our ruler, to behold what next shall hap.\"  So we all heard him speak, and weeping sore  We companied the maidens on their way.  After brief space we looked again, and lo  The man was gone, evanished from our eyes;  Only the king we saw with upraised hand  Shading his eyes as from some awful sight,  That no man might endure to look upon.  A moment later, and we saw him bend  In prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.  But by what doom the stranger met his end  No man save Theseus knoweth.  For there fell  No fiery bold that reft him in that hour,  Nor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.  It was a messenger from heaven, or else  Some gentle, painless cleaving of earth's base;  For without wailing or disease or pain  He passed away--and end most marvelous.  And if to some my tale seems foolishness  I am content that such could count me fool.    CHORUS  Where are the maids and their attendant friends?    MESSENGER  They cannot be far off; the approaching sound  Of lamentation tells they come this way.  [Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]    ANTIGONE  (Str. 1)  Woe, woe! on this sad day       We sisters of one blasted stock       must bow beneath the shock,  Must weep and weep the curse that lay       On him our sire, for whom  In life, a life-long world of care       'Twas ours to bear,       In death must face the gloom       That wraps his tomb.  What tongue can tell  That sight ineffable?    CHORUS  What mean ye, maidens?    ANTIGONE                           All is but surmise.    CHORUS  Is he then gone?    ANTIGONE                      Gone as ye most might wish.  Not in battle or sea storm,  But reft from sight,  By hands invisible borne  To viewless fields of night.  Ah me! on us too night has come,  The night of mourning.  Wither roam  O'er land or sea in our distress  Eating the bread of bitterness?    ISMENE  I know not.  O that Death  Might nip my breath,  And let me share my aged father's fate.  I cannot live a life thus desolate.    CHORUS  Best of daughters, worthy pair,  What heaven brings ye needs must bear,  Fret no more 'gainst Heaven's will;  Fate hath dealt with you not ill.    ANTIGONE  (Ant. 1)  Love can turn past pain to bliss,       What seemed bitter now is sweet.  Ah me! that happy toil is sweet.       The guidance of those dear blind feet.  Dear father, wrapt for aye in nether gloom,       E'en in the tomb  Never shalt thou lack of love repine,       Her love and mine.    CHORUS  His fate--    ANTIGONE            Is even as he planned.    CHORUS  How so?    ANTIGONE  He died, so willed he, in a foreign land.  Lapped in kind earth he sleeps his long last sleep,       And o'er his grave friends weep.  How great our lost these streaming eyes can tell,       This sorrow naught can quell.  Thou hadst thy wish 'mid strangers thus to die,       But I, ah me, not by.    ISMENE  Alas, my sister, what new fate  *     *     *     *     *     *  *     *     *     *     *     *  Befalls us orphans desolate?    CHORUS  His end was blessed; therefore, children, stay  Your sorrow.  Man is born to fate a prey.    ANTIGONE  (Str. 2)  Sister, let us back again.    ISMENE  Why return?    ANTIGONE                 My soul is fain--  ISMENE  Is fain?    ANTIGONE            To see the earthy bed.    ISMENE  Sayest thou?    ANTIGONE                 Where our sire is laid.    ISMENE  Nay, thou can'st not, dost not see--    ANTIGONE  Sister, wherefore wroth with me?    ISMENE  Know'st not--beside--    ANTIGONE                      More must I hear?    ISMENE  Tombless he died, none near.    ANTIGONE  Lead me thither; slay me there.    ISMENE  How shall I unhappy fare,  Friendless, helpless, how drag on  A life of misery alone?    CHORUS  (Ant. 2)  Fear not, maids--    ANTIGONE                      Ah, whither flee?    CHORUS  Refuge hath been found.    ANTIGONE                           For me?    CHORUS  Where thou shalt be safe from harm.    ANTIGONE  I know it.    CHORUS            Why then this alarm?    ANTIGONE  How again to get us home  I know not.    CHORUS                 Why then this roam?    ANTIGONE  Troubles whelm us--    CHORUS                      As of yore.    ANTIGONE  Worse than what was worse before.    CHORUS  Sure ye are driven on the breakers' surge.    ANTIGONE  Alas! we are.    CHORUS                 Alas! 'tis so.    ANTIGONE  Ah whither turn, O Zeus?  No ray  Of hope to cheer the way  Whereon the fates our desperate voyage urge.  [Enter THESEUS]    THESEUS  Dry your tears; when grace is shed  On the quick and on the dead  By dark Powers beneficent,  Over-grief they would resent.    ANTIGONE  Aegeus' child, to thee we pray.    THESEUS  What the boon, my children, say.    ANTIGONE  With our own eyes we fain would see  Our father's tomb.    THESEUS                      That may not be.    ANTIGONE  What say'st thou, King?    THESEUS                           My children, he  Charged me straitly that no moral  Should approach the sacred portal,  Or greet with funeral litanies  The hidden tomb wherein he lies;  Saying, \"If thou keep'st my hest  Thou shalt hold thy realm at rest.\"  The God of Oaths this promise heard,  And to Zeus I pledged my word.    ANTIGONE  Well, if he would have it so,  We must yield.  Then let us go  Back to Thebes, if yet we may  Heal this mortal feud and stay  The self-wrought doom  That drives our brothers to their tomb.

When the families of the Amadei and the Uberti felt their honour wounded  in the affront the younger Buondelmonte had put upon them, in breaking  off his match with a young lady of their family, by marrying another, a  council was held, and the death of the young cavalier was proposed as  the sole atonement for their injured honour. But the consequences which  they anticipated, and which afterwards proved so fatal to the  Florentines, long suspended their decision. At length Moscha Lamberti  suddenly rising, exclaimed, in two proverbs, \"That those who considered  everything would never conclude on anything!\" closing with an ancient  proverbial saying--_cosa fatta capo ha!_ \"a deed done has an end!\" The  proverb sealed the fatal determination, and was long held in mournful  remembrance by the Tuscans; for, according to Villani, it was the cause  and beginning of the accursed factions of the Guelphs and the  Ghibellines. Dante has thus immortalised the energetic expression in a  scene of the \"Inferno.\"      Ed un, ch' avea l'una e l'altra man mozza,    Levando i moncherin per l'aura fosca,    Si che 'l sangue facea la faccia sozza,    Grido:--\"Ricorderati anche del Mosca,    Che dissi, lasso: _Capo ha cosa fatta_,    Che fu 'l mal seme della gente Tosca.\"                              ----Then one    Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom    The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots    Sullied his face, and cried--\"Remember thee    Of Mosca too--I who, alas! exclaim'd    'The deed once done, there is an end'--that proved    A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.\"         CARY'S _Dante_.    This Italian proverb was adopted by Milton; for when deeply engaged in  writing \"The Defence of the People,\" and warned that it might terminate  in his blindness, he resolvedly concluded his work, exclaiming with  great magnanimity, although the fatal prognostication had been  accomplished, _cosa fatta capo ha!_ Did this proverb also influence his  awful decision on that great national event, when the most  honest-minded fluctuated between doubts and fears?    Of a person treacherously used, the Italian proverb says that he has  eaten of      _Le frutte di fratre Alberigo._    The fruit of brother Alberigo.    Landino, on the following passage of Dante, preserves the tragic  story:--      ------Io son fratre Alberigo,    Io son quel dalle frutta del mal orto    Che qui reprendo, &c.         Canto xxxiii.      \"The friar Alberigo,\" answered he,    \"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd    Its fruitage, and am here repaid the date    More luscious for my fig.\"         CARY'S _Dante_.    This was Manfred, the Lord of Fuenza, who, after many cruelties, turned  friar. Reconciling himself to those whom he had so often opposed, to  celebrate the renewal of their friendship he invited them to a  magnificent entertainment. At the end of the dinner the horn blew to  announce the dessert--but it was the signal of this dissimulating  conspirator!--and the fruits which that day were served to his guests  were armed men, who, rushing in, immolated their victims.    Among these historical proverbs none are more entertaining than those  which perpetuate national events, connected with those of another  people. When a Frenchman would let us understand that he has settled  with his creditors, the proverb is _J'ai paye tous mes Anglois_: \"I have  paid all my English.\" This proverb originated when John, the French  king, was taken prisoner by our Black Prince. Levies of money were made  for the king's ransom, and for many French lords; and the French people  have thus perpetuated the military glory of our nation, and their own  idea of it, by making the _English_ and their _creditors_ synonymous  terms. Another relates to the same event--_Le Pape est devenu Francois,  et Jesus Christ Anglais_: \"Now the Pope is become French and Jesus  Christ English;\" a proverb which arose when the Pope, exiled from Rome,  held his court at Avignon in France; and the English prospered so well,  that they possessed more than half the kingdom. The Spanish proverb  concerning England is well known--      _Con todo el mondo guerra,    Y paz con Inglaterra!_      War with the world,    And peace with England!    Whether this proverb was one of the results of their memorable armada,  and was only coined after their conviction of the splendid folly which  they had committed, I cannot ascertain. England must always have been a  desirable ally to Spain against her potent rival and neighbour. The  Italians have a proverb, which formerly, at least, was strongly  indicative of the travelled Englishmen in their country, _Inglese  Italianato e un diavolo incarnato_; \"The Italianised Englishman is a  devil incarnate.\" Formerly there existed a closer intercourse between  our country and Italy than with France. Before and during the reigns of  Elizabeth and James the First that land of the elegant arts modelled our  taste and manners: and more Italians travelled into England, and were  more constant residents, from commercial concerns, than afterwards when  France assumed a higher rank in Europe by her political superiority.  This cause will sufficiently account for the number of Italian proverbs  relating to England, which show an intimacy with our manners that could  not else have occurred. It was probably some sarcastic Italian, and,  perhaps, horologer, who, to describe the disagreement of persons,  proverbed our nation--\"They agree like the clocks of London!\" We were  once better famed for merry Christmases and their pies; and it must have  been the Italians who had been domiciliated with us who gave currency to  the proverb--_Ha piu da fare che i forni di natale in Inghilterra_: \"He  has more business than English ovens at Christmas.\" Our pie-loving  gentry were notorious, and Shakspeare's folio was usually laid open in  the great halls of our nobility to entertain their attendants, who  devoured at once Shakspeare and their pasty. Some of those volumes have  come down to us, not only with the stains, but inclosing even the  identical piecrusts of the Elizabethan age.    I have thus attempted to develope THE ART OF READING PROVERBS; but have  done little more than indicate the theory, and must leave the skilful  student to the delicacy of the practice. I am anxious to rescue from  prevailing prejudices these neglected stores of curious amusement, and  of deep insight into the ways of man, and to point out the bold and  concealed truths which are scattered in these collections. There seems  to be no occurrence in human affairs to which some proverb may not be  applied. All knowledge was long aphoristical and traditional, pithily  contracting the discoveries which were to be instantly comprehended and  easily retained. Whatever be the revolutionary state of man, similar  principles and like occurrences are returning on us; and antiquity,  whenever it is justly applicable to our times, loses its denomination,  and becomes the truth of our own age. A proverb will often cut the knot  which others in vain are attempting to untie. Johnson, palled with the  redundant elegancies of modern composition, once said, \"I fancy mankind  may come in time to write all aphoristically, except in narrative; grow  weary of preparation, and connexion, and illustration, and all those  arts by which a big book is made.\" Many a volume indeed has often been  written to demonstrate what a lover of proverbs could show had long been  ascertained by a single one in his favourite collections.    An insurmountable difficulty, which every paraemiographer has  encountered, is that of forming an apt, a ready, and a systematic  classification: the moral Linnaeus of such a \"systema naturae\" has not yet  appeared. Each discovered his predecessor's mode imperfect, but each was  doomed to meet the same fate.[40] The arrangement of proverbs has  baffled the ingenuity of every one of their collectors. Our Ray, after  long premeditation, has chosen a system with the appearance of an  alphabetical order; but, as it turns out, his system is no system, and  his alphabet is no alphabet. After ten years' labour, the good man could  only arrange his proverbs by commonplaces--by complete sentences--by  phrases or forms of speech--by proverbial similes--and so on. All these  are pursued in alphabetical order, \"by the first letter of the most  'material word,' or if there be more words '_equally material_,' by that  which usually stands foremost.\" The most patient examiner will usually  find that he wants the sagacity of the collector to discover that word  which is \"the most material,\" or, \"the words equally material.\" We have  to search through all that multiplicity of divisions, or conjuring  boxes, in which this juggler of proverbs pretends to hide the ball.[41]    A still more formidable objection against a collection of proverbs, for  the impatient reader, is their unreadableness. Taking in succession a  multitude of insulated proverbs, their slippery nature resists all hope  of retaining one in a hundred; the study of proverbs must be a frequent  recurrence to a gradual collection of favourite ones, which we ourselves  must form. The experience of life will throw a perpetual freshness over  these short and simple texts; every day may furnish a new commentary;  and we may grow old, and find novelty in proverbs by their perpetual  application.    There are, perhaps, about twenty thousand proverbs among the nations of  Europe: many of these have spread in their common intercourse; many are  borrowed from the ancients, chiefly the Greeks, who themselves largely  took them from the eastern nations. Our own proverbs are too often  deficient in that elegance and ingenuity which are often found in the  Spanish and the Italian. Proverbs frequently enliven conversation, or  enter into the business of life in"]]]
