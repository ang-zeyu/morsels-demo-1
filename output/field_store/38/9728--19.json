For that matter, the fire was not exactly lit for us, but, above all, to  warm a row of three pots in which simmered the pigs' food, a mixture  of potatoes and bran. That, despite the tribute of a log, was the real  object of the brushwood fire. The two boarders, on their stools, in  the best places, and we others sitting on our heels formed a semicircle  around those big cauldrons, full to the brim and giving off little jets  of steam, with puff-puff-puffing sounds. The bolder among us, when the  master's eyes were engaged elsewhere, would dig a knife into a well  cooked potato and add it to their bit of bread; for I must say that, if  we did little work in my school, at least we did a deal of eating. It  was the regular custom to crack a few nuts and nibble at a crust while  writing our page or setting out our rows of figures.    We, the smaller ones, in addition to the comfort of studying with our  mouths full, had every now and then two other delights, which were quite  as good as cracking nuts. The back door communicated with the yard where  the hen, surrounded by her brood of chicks, scratched at the dung hill,  while the little porkers, of whom there were a dozen, wallowed in their  stone trough. This door would open sometimes to let one of us out, a  privilege which we abused, for the sly ones among us were careful not to  close it on returning. Forthwith, the porkers would come running in,  one after the other, attracted by the smell of the boiled potatoes. My  bench, the one where the youngsters sat, stood against the wall, under  the copper pail to which we used to go for water when the nuts had made  us thirsty, and was right in the way of the pigs. Up they came trotting  and grunting, curling their little tails; they rubbed against our legs;  they poked their cold pink snouts into our hands in search of a scrap  of crust; they questioned us with their sharp little eyes to learn if we  happened to have a dry chestnut for them in our pockets. When they  had gone the round, some this way and some that, they went back to the  farmyard, driven away by a friendly flick of the master's handkerchief.  Next came the visit of the hen, bringing her velvet-coated chicks to see  us. All of us eagerly crumbled a little bread for our pretty visitors.  We vied with one another in calling them to us and tickling with our  fingers their soft and downy backs. No, there was certainly no lack of  distractions.    What could we learn in such a school as that! Let us first speak of the  young ones, of whom I was one. Each of us had, or rather was supposed  to have, in his hands a little penny book, the alphabet, printed on gray  paper. It began, on the cover, with a pigeon, or something like it. Next  came a cross, followed by the letters in their order. When we turned  over, our eyes encountered the terrible ba, be, bi, bo, bu, the  stumbling block of most of us. When we had mastered that formidable  page, we were considered to know how to read and were admitted among the  big ones. But, if the little book was to be of any use, the least that  was required was that the master should interest himself in us to some  extent and show us how to set about things. For this, the worthy man,  too much taken up with the big ones, had not the time. The famous  alphabet with the pigeon was thrust upon us only to give us the air of  scholars. We were to contemplate it on our bench, to decipher it with  the help of our next neighbor, in case he might know one or two of the  letters. Our contemplation came to nothing, being every moment disturbed  by a visit to the potatoes in the stew pots, a quarrel among playmates  about a marble, the grunting invasion of the porkers or the arrival of  the chicks. With the aid of these distractions, we would wait patiently  until it was time for us to go home. That was our most serious work.    The big ones used to write. They had the benefit of the small amount  of light in the room, by the narrow window where the Wandering Jew and  ruthless Golo faced each other, and of the large and only table with its  circle of seats. The school supplied nothing, not even a drop of ink;  every one had to come with a full set of utensils. The inkhorn of those  days, a relic of the ancient pen case of which Rabelais speaks, was a  long cardboard box divided into two stages. The upper compartment held  the pens, made of goose or turkey quills trimmed with a penknife; the  lower contained, in a tiny well, ink made of soot mixed with vinegar.    The master's great business was to mend the pens--a delicate work, not  without danger for inexperienced fingers--and then to trace at the head  of the white page a line of strokes, single letters or words, according  to the scholar's capabilities. When that is over, keep an eye on the  work of art which is coming to adorn the copy! With what undulating  movements of the wrist does the hand, resting on the little finger,  prepare and plan its flight! All at once, the hand starts off, flies,  whirls; and, lo and behold, under the line of writing is unfurled  a garland of circles, spirals and flourishes, framing a bird with  outspread wings, the whole, if you please, in red ink, the only kind  worthy of such a pen. Large and small, we stood awestruck in the  presence of these marvels. The family, in the evening, after supper,  would pass from hand to hand the masterpiece brought back from school:  'What a man!' was the comment. 'What a man, to draw you a Holy Ghost  with a stroke of the pen!'    What was read at my school? At most, in French, a few selections from  sacred history. Latin recurred oftener, to teach us to sing vespers  properly. The more advanced pupils tried to decipher manuscript, a deed  of sale, the hieroglyphics of some scrivener.    And history, geography? No one ever heard of them. What difference did  it make to us whether the earth was round or square! In either case, it  was just as hard to make it bring forth anything.    And grammar? The master troubled his head very little about that; and we  still less. We should have been greatly surprised by the novelty and the  forbidding look of such words in the grammatical jargon as substantive,  indicative and subjunctive. Accuracy of language, whether of speech  or writing, must be learnt by practice. And none of us was troubled  by scruples in this respect. What was the use of all these subtleties,  when, on coming out of school, a lad simply went back to his flock of  sheep!    And arithmetic? Yes, we did a little of this but not under that learned  name. We called it sums. To put down rows of figures, not too long,  add them and subtract them one from the other was more or less familiar  work. On Saturday evenings, to finish up the week, there was a general  orgy of sums. The top boy stood up and, in a loud voice, recited the  multiplication table up to twelve times. I say twelve times, for in  those days, because of our old duodecimal measures, it was the custom to  count as far as the twelve times table, instead of the ten times of the  metric system. When this recital was over, the whole class, the little  ones included, took it up in chorus, creating such an uproar that chicks  and porkers took to flight if they happened to be there. And this went  on to twelve times twelve, the first in the row starting the next table  and the whole class repeating it as loud as it could yell. Of all that  we were taught in school, the multiplication table was what we knew  best, for this noisy method ended by dinning the different numbers  into our ears. This does not mean that we became skilful reckoners. The  cleverest of us easily got muddled with the figures to be carried in a  multiplication sum. As for division, rare indeed were they who reached  such heights. In short, the moment a problem, however insignificant, had  to be solved, we had recourse to mental gymnastics much rather than to  the learned aid of arithmetic.    When all is said, our master was an excellent man who could have kept  school very well but for his lack of one thing; and that was time. He  devoted to us all the little leisure which his numerous functions  left him. And, first of all, he managed the property of an absentee  landowner, who only occasionally set foot in the village. He had under  his care an old castle with four towers, which had become so many pigeon  houses; he directed the getting in of the hay, the walnuts, the apples  and the oats. We used to help him during the summer, when the school,  which was well attended in winter, was almost deserted. All that  remained, because they were not yet big enough to work in the fields,  were a few children, including him who was one day to set down these  memorable facts. Lessons at that time were less dull. They were often  given on the hay or on the straw; oftener still, lesson time was spent  in cleaning out the dovecote or stamping on the snails that had sallied  in rainy weather from their fortresses, the tall box borders of the  garden belonging to the castle.    Our master was a barber. With his light hand, which was so clever at  beautifying our copies with curlicue birds, he shaved the notabilities  of the place: the mayor, the parish priest, the notary. Our master was a  bell ringer. A wedding or a christening interrupted the lessons: he had  to ring a peal. A gathering storm gave us a holiday: the great bell must  be tolled to ward off the lightning and the hail. Our master was a choir  singer. With his mighty voice, he filled the church when he led the  Magnificat at vespers. Our master wound up and regulated the village  clock. This was his proudest function. Giving a glance at the sun, to  ascertain the time more or less nearly, he would climb to the top of  the steeple, open a huge cage of rafters and find himself in a maze of  wheels and springs whereof the secret"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#16)"],[1,"against--encouraged by the violent  excitement of the occasion--had attacked her at this supreme moment.  Deathly pale and sick, she reeled to the side of the cabin. There was  another shot, and a violent clashing of arms; and Frere, leaving the  miserable woman to her fate, leapt out on to the deck.          CHAPTER X. EIGHT BELLS.        At seven o'clock there had been also a commotion in the prison. The news  of the fever had awoke in the convicts all that love of liberty which  had but slumbered during the monotony of the earlier part of the voyage.  Now that death menaced them, they longed fiercely for the chance of  escape which seemed permitted to freemen. \"Let us get out!\" they said,  each man speaking to his particular friend. \"We are locked up here to  die like sheep.\" Gloomy faces and desponding looks met the gaze of each,  and sometimes across this gloom shot a fierce glance that lighted up  its blackness, as a lightning-flash renders luridly luminous the indigo  dullness of a thunder-cloud. By and by, in some inexplicable way, it  came to be understood that there was a conspiracy afloat, that they  were to be released from their shambles, that some amongst them had been  plotting for freedom. The 'tween decks held its foul breath in wondering  anxiety, afraid to breathe its suspicions. The influence of this  predominant idea showed itself by a strange shifting of atoms. The  mass of villainy, ignorance, and innocence began to be animated with  something like a uniform movement. Natural affinities came together,  and like allied itself to like, falling noiselessly into harmony, as the  pieces of glass and coloured beads in a kaleidoscope assume mathematical  forms. By seven bells it was found that the prison was divided into  three parties--the desperate, the timid, and the cautious. These three  parties had arranged themselves in natural sequence. The mutineers,  headed by Gabbett, Vetch, and the Moocher, were nearest to the door; the  timid--boys, old men, innocent poor wretches condemned on circumstantial  evidence, or rustics condemned to be turned into thieves for pulling  a turnip--were at the farther end, huddling together in alarm; and the  prudent--that is to say, all the rest, ready to fight or fly, advance or  retreat, assist the authorities or their companions, as the fortune of  the day might direct--occupied the middle space. The mutineers proper  numbered, perhaps, some thirty men, and of these thirty only half a  dozen knew what was really about to be done.    The ship's bell strikes the half-hour, and as the cries of the three  sentries passing the word to the quarter-deck die away, Gabbett, who has  been leaning with his back against the door, nudges Jemmy Vetch.    \"Now, Jemmy,\" says he in a whisper, \"tell 'em!\"    The whisper being heard by those nearest the giant, a silence ensues,  which gradually spreads like a ripple over the surface of the crowd,  reaching even the bunks at the further end.    \"Gentlemen,\" says Mr. Vetch, politely sarcastic in his own hangdog  fashion, \"myself and my friends here are going to take the ship for you.  Those who like to join us had better speak at once, for in about half an  hour they will not have the opportunity.\"    He pauses, and looks round with such an impertinently confident air,  that three waverers in the party amidships slip nearer to hear him.    \"You needn't be afraid,\" Mr. Vetch continues, \"we have arranged it all  for you. There are friends waiting for us outside, and the door will be  open directly. All we want, gentlemen, is your vote and interest--I mean  your--\"    \"Gaffing agin!\" interrupts the giant angrily. \"Come to business, carn't  yer? Tell 'em they may like it or lump it, but we mean to have the ship,  and them as refuses to join us we mean to chuck overboard. That's about  the plain English of it!\"    This practical way of putting it produces a sensation, and the  conservative party at the other end look in each other's faces with some  alarm. A grim murmur runs round, and somebody near Mr. Gabbett laughs a  laugh of mingled ferocity and amusement, not reassuring to timid people.  \"What about the sogers?\" asked a voice from the ranks of the cautious.    \"D--- the sogers!\" cries the Moocher, moved by a sudden inspiration.  \"They can but shoot yer, and that's as good as dyin' of typhus anyway!\"    The right chord had been struck now, and with a stifled roar the prison  admitted the truth of the sentiment. \"Go on, old man!\" cries Jemmy Vetch  to the giant, rubbing his thin hands with eldritch glee. \"They're all  right!\" And then, his quick ears catching the jingle of arms, he said,  \"Stand by now for the door--one rush'll do it.\"    It was eight o'clock and the relief guard was coming from the after  deck. The crowd of prisoners round the door held their breath to listen.  \"It's all planned,\" says Gabbett, in a low growl. \"W'en the door h'opens  we rush, and we're in among the guard afore they know where they are.  Drag 'em back into the prison, grab the h'arm-rack, and it's all over.\"    \"They're very quiet about it,\" says the Crow suspiciously. \"I hope it's  all right.\"    \"Stand from the door, Miles,\" says Pine's voice outside, in its usual  calm accents.    The Crow was relieved. The tone was an ordinary one, and Miles was the  soldier whom Sarah Purfoy had bribed not to fire. All had gone well.    The keys clashed and turned, and the bravest of the prudent party,  who had been turning in his mind the notion of risking his life for a  pardon, to be won by rushing forward at the right moment and alarming  the guard, checked the cry that was in his throat as he saw the men  round the door draw back a little for their rush, and caught a glimpse  of the giant's bristling scalp and bared gums.    \"NOW!\" cries Jemmy Vetch, as the iron-plated oak swung back, and with  the guttural snarl of a charging wild boar, Gabbett hurled himself out  of the prison.    The red line of light which glowed for an instant through the doorway  was blotted out by a mass of figures. All the prison surged forward, and  before the eye could wink, five, ten, twenty, of the most desperate  were outside. It was as though a sea, breaking against a stone wall,  had found some breach through which to pour its waters. The contagion  of battle spread. Caution was forgotten; and those at the back, seeing  Jemmy Vetch raised upon the crest of that human billow which reared its  black outline against an indistinct perspective of struggling figures,  responded to his grin of encouragement by rushing furiously forward.    Suddenly a horrible roar like that of a trapped wild beast was heard.  The rushing torrent choked in the doorway, and from out the lantern glow  into which the giant had rushed, a flash broke, followed by a groan, as  the perfidious sentry fell back shot through the breast. The mass in  the doorway hung irresolute, and then by sheer weight of pressure from  behind burst forward, and as it so burst, the heavy door crashed into  its jambs, and the bolts were shot into their places.    All this took place by one of those simultaneous movements which are so  rapid in execution, so tedious to describe in detail. At one instant the  prison door had opened, at the next it had closed. The picture which  had presented itself to the eyes of the convicts was as momentary as are  those of the thaumatoscope. The period of time that had elapsed between  the opening and the shutting of the door could have been marked by the  musket shot.    The report of another shot, and then a noise of confused cries, mingled  with the clashing of arms, informed the imprisoned men that the ship  had been alarmed. How would it go with their friends on deck? Would they  succeed in overcoming the guards, or would they be beaten back? They  would soon know; and in the hot dusk, straining their eyes to see each  other, they waited for the issue Suddenly the noises ceased, and a  strange rumbling sound fell upon the ears of the listeners.                *          *          *          *          *      What had taken place?    This--the men pouring out of the darkness into the sudden glare of  the lanterns, rushed, bewildered, across the deck. Miles, true to his  promise, did not fire, but the next instant Vickers had snatched the  firelock from him, and leaping into the stream, turned about and  fired down towards the prison. The attack was more sudden then he had  expected, but he did not lose his presence of mind. The shot would serve  a double purpose. It would warn the men in the barrack, and perhaps  check the rush by stopping up the doorway with a corpse. Beaten back,  struggling, and indignant, amid the storm of hideous faces, his humanity  vanished, and he aimed deliberately at the head of Mr. James Vetch; the  shot, however, missed its mark, and killed the unhappy Miles.    Gabbett and his companions had by this time reached the foot of the  companion ladder, there to encounter the cutlasses of the doubled guard  gleaming redly in the glow of the lanterns. A glance up the hatchway  showed the giant that the arms he had planned to seize were defended by  ten firelocks, and that, behind the open doors of the partition which  ran abaft the mizenmast, the remainder of the detachment stood to their  arms. Even his dull intellect comprehended that the desperate project  had failed, and that he had been betrayed. With the roar of despair  which had penetrated into the prison, he turned to fight his way back,  just in time to see the crowd in the gangway recoil from the flash of  the musket fired by Vickers. The next instant, Pine and two soldiers,  taking advantage of the momentary cessation of the press, shot the  bolts, and secured the prison.    The mutineers were caught in a trap.    The narrow space between the barracks and the barricade was choked with  struggling figures. Some twenty convicts, and half as many soldiers,  struck and stabbed at each other in"]]]
