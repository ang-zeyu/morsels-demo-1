Epithalamia were marriage songs, anciently sung in praise of the bride  or bridegroom, wishing them happiness, prosperity and a numerous issue.    Among the Romans there were three different kinds of marriage. The  ceremony of the first consisted in the young couple eating a cake  together made only of wheat, salt and water. The second kind was  celebrated by the parties solemnly pledging their faith to each other,  by giving and receiving a piece of money. This was the most common way  of marrying among the Romans. It continued in use, even after they  became Christians. When writings were introduced to testify that a man  and a woman had become husband and wife, and also, that the husband had  settled a dower upon his bride, these writings were called _Tabulae  Dotales_ (dowry tables;) and hence, perhaps the words in our marriage  ceremony, \"I thee endow.\"    The third kind of marriage was, when a man and woman, having cohabited  for some time and had children, found it expedient to continue together.  In this case, if they made up the matter between themselves, it became  a valid marriage, and the children were considered as legitimate.    Something similar to this is the present custom in Scotland. There, if a  man live with, and have children by a woman, though he do not marry her  till he be upon his death-bed, all the children are thereby legitimated  and become entitled to the honors and estates of their father. The case  is the same in Holland and some parts of Germany; with this difference  only, that all the children to be legitimated must appear with the  father and mother in church at the ceremony of their marriage.      FEMALE FRIENDSHIP.    It has long been a question, Which of the two sexes is most capable of  friendship? Montague, who is so much celebrated for his knowledge of  human nature, has given it positively against the women; and his opinion  has been generally embraced.    Friendship perhaps, in women, is more rare than among men; but, at the  same time, it must be allowed that where it is found, it is more tender.    Men, in general, have more of the parade than the graces of friendship.  They often wound while they serve; and their warmest sentiments are not  very enlightened, with respect to those minute sentiments which are of  so much value. But women have a refined sensibility, which makes them  see every thing; nothing escapes them. They divine the silent  friendship; they encourage the bashful or timid friendship; they offer  the sweetest consolations to friendship in distress. Furnished with  finer instruments, they treat more delicately a wounded heart. They  compose it, and prevent it from feeling its agonies. They know, above  all, how to give value to a thousand things, which have no value in  themselves.    We ought therefore, perhaps, to desire the friendship of a man upon  great occasions; but, for general happiness, we must prefer the  friendship of a woman.    With regard to female intimacies, it may be taken for granted that there  is no young woman who has not, or wishes not to have, a companion of her  own sex, to whom she may unbosom herself on every occasion. That there  are women capable of friendship with women, few impartial observers will  deny. There have been many evident proofs of it, and those carried as  far as seemed compatible with the imperfections of our common nature. It  is, however, questioned by some; while others believe that it happens  exceedingly seldom. Between married and unmarried women, it no doubt  happens very often; whether it does so between those that are single, is  not so certain. Young men appear more frequently susceptible of a  generous and steady friendship for each other, than females as yet  unconnected; especially, if the latter have, or are supposed to have,  pretensions to beauty, not adjusted by the public.    In the frame and condition of females, however, compared with those of  the other sex, there are some circumstances which may help towards an  apology for this unfavorable feature in their character.    The state of matrimony is necessary to the support, order, and comfort  of society. But it is a state that subjects the women to a great variety  of solicitude and pain. Nothing could carry them through it with any  tolerable satisfaction or spirit, but very strong and almost  unconquerable attachments. To produce these, is it not fit they should  be peculiarly sensible to the attention and regards of the men? Upon the  same ground, does it not seem agreeable to the purposes of Providence,  that the securing of this attention, and these regards, should be a  principal aim? But can such an aim be pursued without frequent  competition? And will not that too readily occasion jealousy, envy, and  all the unamiable effects of mutual _rivalship_? Without the restraints  of superior worth and sentiment, it certainly will. But can these be  ordinarily expected from the prevailing turn of female education; or  from the little pains that women, as well as other human beings,  commonly take to _control_ themselves, and to act nobly? In this _last_  respect, the sexes appear pretty much on the same footing.    This reasoning is not meant to justify the indulgence of those little  and sometimes base passions towards one another, with which females  have been so generally charged. It is only intended to represent such  passions in the first approach; and, while not entertained, as less  criminal than the men are apt to state them; and to prove that, in their  attachments to each other, the latter have not always that merit above  the women, which they are apt to claim. In the mean time, let it be the  business of the ladies, by emulating the gentlemen, where they appear  good-natured and disinterested, to disprove their imputation, and to  show a temper open to _friendship_ as well as to _love_.    To talk much of the latter is natural for both; to talk much of the  former, is considered by the men as one way of doing themselves honor.  Friendship, they well know, is that dignified form, which, in  speculation at least every heart must respect.    But in friendship, as in religion, which on many accounts it resembles,  speculation is often substituted in the place of practice. People fancy  themselves possessed of the thing, and hope that others will fancy so  too, because they are fond of the name, and have learned to talk about  it with plausibility. Such talk indeed imposes, till experience give it  the lie.    To say the truth, there seems in either sex but little of what a fond  imagination, unacquainted with the falsehood of the world, and  warmed by affections which its selfishness has not yet chilled, would  reckon friendship. In theory, the standard is raised too high; we ought  not, however, to wish it much lower. The honest sensibilities of  ingenuous nature should not be checked by the over-cautious maxims of  political prudence. No advantage, obtained by such frigidity, can  compensate for the want of those warm effusions of the heart into the  bosom of a friend, which are doubtless among the most exquisite  pleasures. At the same time, however, it must be owned, that they often  by the inevitable lot of humanity, make way for the bitterest pains  which the breast can experience. Happy beyond the common condition of  her sex, is she who has found a friend indeed; open hearted, yet  discreet; generously fervent, yet steady; thoroughly virtuous, but not  severe; wise, as well as cheerful! Can such a friend be loved too much,  or cherished too tenderly? If to excellence and happiness there be any  one way more compendious than another, next to friendship with the  Supreme Being, it is this.    But when a mixture of minds so beautiful and so sweet takes place, it is  generally, or rather always the result of early prepossession, casual  intercourse, or in short, a combination of such causes as are not to be  brought together by management or design. This noble plant may be  cultivated; but it must grow spontaneously.      ON THE CHOICE OF A HUSBAND.            Assist me, ye Nine,          While the youth I define,    With whom I in wedlock would class;          And ye blooming fair,          Lend a listening ear,    To approve of the man as you pass.            Not the changeable fry          Who love, nor know why,    But follow bedup'd by their passions:          Such votaries as these          Are like waves of the seas,    And steer'd by their own inclinations.            The hectoring blade          How unfit for the maid,    Where meekness and modesty reigns!          Such a blundering bully          I'll speak against truly,    Whatever I get for my pains.            Not the dogmatic elf,          Whose great all is himself,    Whose alone _ipse dixit_ is law:          What a figure he'll make,          How like Momus he'll speak    With sneering burlesque, a pshaw! pshaw!            Not the covetous wretch          Whose heart's at full stretch    To gain an inordinate treasure;          Him leave with the rest,          And such mortals detest,    Who sacrifice life without measure.            The fluttering fop,          How empty his top!    Nay, but some call him coxcomb, I trow;          But 'tis losing your time,          He's not worth half a rhyme,    Let the fag ends of prose bind his brow.

Sancroft had absented himself from  the Convention: he had refused to sit in the Privy Council: he had  ceased to confirm, to ordain, and to institute; and he was seldom  seen out of the walls of his palace at Lambeth. He, on all occasions,  professed to think himself still bound by his old oath of allegiance.  Burnet he regarded as a scandal to the priesthood, a Presbyterian in a  surplice. The prelate who should lay hands on that unworthy head would  commit more than one great sin. He would, in a sacred place, and before  a great congregation of the faithful, at once acknowledge an usurper  as a King, and confer on a schismatic the character of a Bishop. During  some time Sancroft positively declared that he would not obey the  precept of William. Lloyd of Saint Asaph, who was the common friend of  the Archbishop and of the Bishop elect, intreated and expostulated  in vain. Nottingham, who, of all the laymen connected with the new  government, stood best with the clergy, tried his influence, but to no  better purpose. The Jacobites said every where that they were sure of  the good old Primate; that he had the spirit of a martyr; that he was  determined to brave, in the cause of the Monarchy and of the Church, the  utmost rigour of those laws with which the obsequious parliaments of the  sixteenth century had fenced the Royal Supremacy. He did in truth hold  out long. But at the last moment his heart failed him, and he looked  round him for some mode of escape. Fortunately, as childish scruples  often disturbed his conscience, childish expedients often quieted it. A  more childish expedient than that to which he now resorted is not to be  found in all the tones of the casuists. He would not himself bear a part  in the service. He would not publicly pray for the Prince and Princess  as King and Queen. He would not call for their mandate, order it to be  read, and then proceed to obey it. But he issued a commission empowering  any three of his suffragans to commit, in his name, and as his  delegates, the sins which he did not choose to commit in person. The  reproaches of all parties soon made him ashamed of himself. He then  tried to suppress the evidence of his fault by means more discreditable  than the fault itself. He abstracted from among the public records of  which he was the guardian the instrument by which he had authorised his  brethren to act for him, and was with difficulty induced to give it up.  [79]    Burnet however had, under the authority of this instrument, been  consecrated. When he next waited on Mary, she reminded him of the  conversations which they had held at the Hague about the high duties and  grave responsibility of Bishops. \"I hope,\" she said, \"that you will put  your notions in practice.\" Her hope was not disappointed. Whatever  may be thought of Burnet's opinions touching civil and ecclesiastical  polity, or of the temper and judgment which he showed in defending those  opinions, the utmost malevolence of faction could not venture to deny  that he tended his flock with a zeal, diligence, and disinterestedness  worthy of the purest ages of the Church. His jurisdiction extended over  Wiltshire and Berkshire. These counties he divided into districts which  he sedulously visited. About two months of every summer he passed in  preaching, catechizing, and confirming daily from church to church. When  he died there was no corner of his diocese in which the people had not  had seven or eight opportunities of receiving his instructions and of  asking his advice. The worst weather, the worst roads, did not prevent  him from discharging these duties. On one occasion, when the floods were  out, he exposed his life to imminent risk rather than disappoint a rural  congregation which was in expectation of a discourse from the Bishop.  The poverty of the inferior clergy was a constant cause of uneasiness  to his kind and generous heart. He was indefatigable and at length  successful in his attempts to obtain for them from the Crown that  grant which is known by the name of Queen Anne's Bounty. [80] He was  especially careful, when he travelled through his diocese, to lay  no burden on them. Instead of requiring them to entertain him, he  entertained them. He always fixed his headquarters at a market town,  kept a table there, and, by his decent hospitality and munificent  charities, tried to conciliate those who were prejudiced against his  doctrines. When he bestowed a poor benefice, and he had many such to  bestow, his practice was to add out of his own purse twenty pounds a  year to the income. Ten promising young men, to each of whom he allowed  thirty pounds a year, studied divinity under his own eye in the close  of Salisbury. He had several children but he did not think himself  justified in hoarding for them. Their mother had brought him a good  fortune. With that fortune, he always said, they must be content: He  would not, for their sakes, be guilty of the crime of raising an estate  out of revenues sacred to piety and charity. Such merits as these will,  in the judgment of wise and candid men, appear fully to atone for every  offence which can be justly imputed to him. [81]    When he took his seat in the House of Lords, he found that assembly  busied in ecclesiastical legislation. A statesman who was well known  to be devoted to the Church had undertaken to plead the cause of the  Dissenters. No subject in the realm occupied so important and commanding  a position with reference to religious parties as Nottingham. To the  influence derived from rank, from wealth, and from office, he added  the higher influence which belongs to knowledge, to eloquence, and to  integrity. The orthodoxy of his creed, the regularity of his devotions,  and the purity of his morals gave a peculiar weight to his opinions on  questions in which the interests of Christianity were concerned. Of all  the ministers of the new Sovereigns, he had the largest share of the  confidence of the clergy. Shrewsbury was certainly a Whig, and probably  a freethinker: he had lost one religion; and it did not very clearly  appear that he had found another. Halifax had been during many years  accused of scepticism, deism, atheism. Danby's attachment to episcopacy  and the liturgy was rather political than religious. But Nottingham  was such a son as the Church was proud to own. Propositions, therefore,  which, if made by his colleagues, would infallibly produce a violent  panic among the clergy, might, if made by him, find a favourable  reception even in universities and chapter houses. The friends  of religious liberty were with good reason desirous to obtain his  cooperation; and, up to a certain point, he was not unwilling to  cooperate with them. He was decidedly for a toleration. He was even for  what was then called a comprehension: that is to say, he was desirous  to make some alterations in the Anglican discipline and ritual for the  purpose of removing the scruples of the moderate Presbyterians. But he  was not prepared to give up the Test Act. The only fault which he found  with that Act was that it was not sufficiently stringent, and that it  left loopholes through which schismatics sometimes crept into civil  employments. In truth it was because he was not disposed to part with  the Test that he was willing to consent to some changes in the Liturgy.  He conceived that, if the entrance of the Church were but a very little  widened, great numbers who had hitherto lingered near the threshold  would press in. Those who still remained without would then not be  sufficiently numerous or powerful to extort any further concession, and  would be glad to compound for a bare toleration. [82]    The opinion of the Low Churchmen concerning the Test Act differed widely  from his. But many of them thought that it was of the highest  importance to have his support on the great questions of Toleration and  Comprehension. From the scattered fragments of information which have  come down to us, it appears that a compromise was made. It is quite  certain that Nottingham undertook to bring in a Toleration Bill and a  Comprehension Bill, and to use his best endeavours to carry both bills  through the House of Lords. It is highly probable that, in return for  this great service, some of the leading Whigs consented to let the Test  Act remain for the present unaltered.    There was no difficulty in framing either the Toleration Bill or the  Comprehension Bill. The situation of the dissenters had been much  discussed nine or ten years before, when the kingdom was distracted  by the fear of a Popish plot, and when there was among Protestants a  general disposition to unite against the common enemy. The government  had then been willing to make large concessions to the Whig party, on  condition that the crown should be suffered to descend according to the  regular course. A draught of a law authorising the public worship of the  nonconformists, and a draught of a law making some alterations in the  public worship of the Established Church, had been prepared, and would  probably have been passed by both Houses without difficulty, had not  Shaftesbury and his coadjutors refused to listen to any terms, and, by  grasping at what was beyond their reach, missed advantages which might  easily have been secured. In the framing of these draughts, Nottingham,  then an active member of the House of Commons, had borne a considerable  part. He now brought them forth from the obscurity in which they had  remained since the dissolution of the Oxford Parliament, and laid them,  with some slight alterations, on the table of the Lords. [83]    The Toleration Bill passed both Houses with little debate. This  celebrated statute, long considered as the Great Charter of religious  liberty, has since been extensively modified, and is hardly known to  the present generation except by name.
