'However, Birmingham people have souls; and I have neither taste nor  talent for the sort of work which you cut out for me. And I beg to  decline your offer.    I am, yours truly,    JOHN H. NEWMAN.'    Such words were not the words of wisdom. It is easy to imagine the  feelings of Monsignor Talbot. 'Newman's work none here can understand,'  he burst out to his friend. 'Poor man, by living almost ever since he  has been a Catholic, surrounded by a set of inferior men who idolise  him, I do not think he has ever acquired the Catholic instincts.' As for  his views on the Temporal Power--'well, people said that he had actually  sent a subscription to Garibaldi. Yes, the man was incomprehensible,  heretical, dangerous; he was \"uncatholic and unchristian.\"' Monsignor  Talbot even trembled for the position of Manning in England.    'I am afraid that the old school of Catholics will rally round Newman in  opposition to you and Rome. Stand firm, do not yield a bit in the line  you have taken. As I have promised, I shall stand by you. You will have  battles to fight because every Englishman is naturally anti-Roman. To be  Roman is an effort to an Englishman an effort. Dr. Newman is more English than  the English. His spirit must be crushed.'    His spirit must be crushed! Certainly there could be no doubt of that.    'What you write about Dr Newman,' Manning replied, 'is true. Whether he  knows it or not, he has become the centre of those who hold low views  about the Holy See, are anti-Roman, cold and silent, to say no more,  about the Temporal Power; national, English, critical of Catholic  devotions, and always on the lower side.... You will take care,' he  concluded, 'that things are correctly known and understood where you  are.'    The confederates matured their plans. While Newman was making his  arrangements for the Oxford Oratory, Cardinal Reisach visited London.  'Cardinal Reisach has just left,' wrote Manning to Monsignor Talbot: 'he  has seen and understands all that is going on in England.' But Newman  had no suspicions. It was true that persistent rumours of his  unorthodoxy and his anti-Roman leanings had begun to float about, and  these rumours had been traced to Rome. But what were rumours? Then, too,  Newman found out that Cardinal Reisach had been to Oxford without his  knowledge, and had inspected the land for the Oratory. That seemed odd;  but all doubts were set at rest by the arrival from Propaganda of an  official ratification of his scheme. There would be nothing but plain  sailing now. Newman was almost happy; radiant visions came into his mind  of a wonderful future in Oxford, the gradual growth of Catholic  principles, the decay of liberalism, the inauguration of a second Oxford  Movement, the conversion--who knows?--of Mark Pattison, the triumph of  the Church.... 'Earlier failures do not matter now,' he exclaimed to a  friend. 'I see that I have been reserved by God for this.'    Just then a long blue envelope was brought into the room. Newman opened  it. 'All is over,' he said, 'I am not allowed to go.' The envelope  contained a letter from the Bishop announcing that, together with the  formal permission for an Oratory at Oxford, Propaganda had issued a  secret instruction to the effect that Newman himself was by no means to  reside there. If he showed signs of doing so, he was blandly and suavely  ('blande suaviterque' were the words of the Latin instrument) to be  prevented. And now the secret instruction had come into  operation--blande suaviterque: Dr. Newman's spirit had been crushed.    His friends made some gallant efforts to retrieve the situation; but, it  was in vain. Father St. John hurried to Rome and the indignant laity of  England, headed by Lord Edward Howard, the guardian of the young Duke of  Norfolk, seized the opportunity of a particularly virulent anonymous  attack upon Newman, to send him an address in which they expressed their  feeling that 'every blow that touches you inflicts a wound upon the  Catholic Church in this country'. The only result was an outburst of  redoubled fury upon the part of Monsignor Talbot. The address, he  declared, was an insult to the Holy See. 'What is the province of the  laity?' he interjected. 'To hunt, to shoot, to entertain. These matters  they understand, but to meddle with ecclesiastical matters they have no  right at all.' Once more he warned Manning to be careful.    'Dr. Newman is the most dangerous man in England, and you will see that  he will make use of the laity against your Grace. You must not be afraid  of him. It will require much prudence, but you must be firm. The Holy  Father still places his confidence in you; but if you yield and do not  fight the battle of the Holy See against the detestable spirit growing  up in England, he will begin to regret Cardinal Wiseman, who knew how to  keep the laity in order.' Manning had no thought of 'yielding'; but, he  pointed out to his agitated friend that an open conflict between himself  and Newman would be 'as great a scandal to the Church in England, and as  great a victory to the Anglicans, as could be'. He would act quietly,  and there would be no more difficulty. The Bishops were united, and the  Church was sound.    On this, Monsignor Talbot hurried to Father St. John's lodgings in Rome  to express his regret at the misunderstanding that had arisen, to wonder  how it could possibly have occurred, and to hope that Dr. Newman might  consent to be made a Protonotary Apostolic. That was all the  satisfaction that Father St. John was to obtain from his visit to Rome.  A few weeks later, the scheme of the Oxford Oratory was finally quashed.    When all was over, Manning thought that the time had come for a  reconciliation. He made advances through a common friend; what had he  done, he asked, to offend Dr. Newman? Letters passed, and, naturally  enough, they only widened the breach. Newman was not the man to be  polite.    'I can only repeat,' he wrote at last, 'what I said when you last heard  from me. I do not know whether I am on my head or my heels when I have  active relations with you. In spite of my friendly feelings, this is the  judgment of my intellect.' 'Meanwhile,' he concluded, 'I propose to say  seven masses for your intention amid the difficulties and anxieties of  your ecclesiastical duties.'    And Manning could only return the compliment.    At about this time, the Curate of Littlemore had a singular experience.  As he was passing by the Church he noticed an old man, very poorly  dressed in an old grey coat with the collar turned up, leaning over the  lych gate, in floods of tears. He was apparently in great trouble, and  his hat was pulled down over his eyes as if he wished to hide his  features. For a moment, however, he turned towards the Curate, who was  suddenly struck by something familiar in the face. Could it be--? A  photograph hung over the Curate's mantelpiece of the man who had made  Littlemore famous by his sojourn there more than twenty years ago--he  had never seen the original; but now, was it possible--? He looked  again, and he could doubt no longer. It was Dr. Newman. He sprang  forward, with proffers of assistance. Could he be of any use? 'Oh no,  no!' was the reply. 'Oh no, no!' But the Curate felt that he could not  run away and leave so eminent a character in such distress. 'Was it not  Dr. Newman he had the honour of addressing?' he asked, with all the  respect and sympathy at his command. 'Was there nothing that could be  done?' But the old man hardly seemed to understand what was being said  to him. 'Oh no, no!' he repeated, with the tears streaming down his  face, 'Oh no, no!'      VII    MEANWHILE, a remarkable problem was absorbing the attention of the  Catholic Church. Once more, for a moment, the eyes of all Christendom  were fixed upon Rome. The temporal Power of the Pope had now almost  vanished; but, as his worldly dominions steadily diminished, the  spiritual pretensions of the Holy Father no less steadily increased. For  seven centuries the immaculate conception of the Virgin had been highly  problematical; Pio Nono spoke, and the doctrine became an article of  faith. A few years later, the Court of Rome took another step: a  Syllabus Errorum was issued, in which all the favourite beliefs of the  modern world--the rights of democracies, the claims of science, the  sanctity of free speech, the principles of toleration--were  categorically denounced, and their supporters abandoned to the Divine  wrath.    Yet it was observed that the modern world proceeded as before. Something  more drastic appeared to be necessary--some bold and striking measure  which should concentrate the forces of the faithful, and confound their  enemies. The tremendous doctrine of Papal Infallibility, beloved of all  good Catholics, seemed to offer just the opening that was required. Let  that doctrine be proclaimed, with the assent of the whole Church, an  article of faith, and, in the face of such an affirmation, let the  modern world do its worst! Accordingly, a General Council--the first to  be held since the Council of Trent more than 300 years before--was  summoned to the Vatican, for the purpose, so it was announced, of  providing 'an adequate remedy to the disorders, intellectual and moral,  of Christendom'. The programme might seem a large one, even for a  General Council; but everyone knew what it meant.    Everyone, however, was not quite of one mind. There were those to whom  even the mysteries of infallibility caused some searchings of heart. It  was true, no doubt, that Our Lord, by saying to Peter, 'Thou art Cephas,  which is by interpretation a stone', thereby endowed that Apostle with  the supreme and full primacy and principality over the Universal  Catholic Church; it was equally certain that Peter afterwards became the  Bishop of Rome; nor could it be doubted that the Roman Pontiff was his  successor. Thus it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#16)"],[1,"such a kind that no  foresight could have been expected to look out for them, the  defendant is not to blame for having failed to do so. It seems to  be admitted by the English judges that, even on the question  whether the acts of leaving dry trimmings in hot weather by the  side of a railroad, and then sending an engine over the track,  are [93] negligent,--that is, are a ground of liability,--the  consequences which might reasonably be anticipated are material.  /1/ Yet these are acts which, under the circumstances, can hardly  be called innocent in their natural and obvious effects. The same  doctrine has been applied to acts in violation of statute which  could not reasonably have been expected to lead to the result  complained of. /2/    But there is no difference in principle between the case where a  natural cause or physical factor intervenes after the act in some  way not to be foreseen, and turns what seemed innocent to harm,  and the case where such a cause or factor intervenes, unknown, at  the time; as, for the matter of that, it did in the English cases  cited. If a man is excused in the one case because he is not to  blame, he must be in the other. The difference taken in Gibbons  v. Pepper, cited above, is not between results which are and  those which are not the consequences of the defendant's acts: it  is between consequences which he was bound as a reasonable man to  contemplate, and those which he was not. Hard spurring is just so  much more likely to lead to harm than merely riding a horse in  the street, that the court thought that the defendant would be  bound to look out for the consequences of the one, while it would  not hold him liable for those resulting merely from the other;  [94] because the possibility of being run away with when riding  quietly, though familiar, is comparatively slight. If, however,  the horse had been unruly, and had been taken into a frequented  place for the purpose of being broken, the owner might have been  liable, because \"it was his fault to bring a wild horse into a  place where mischief might probably be done.\"    To return to the example of the accidental blow with a stick  lifted in self-defence, there is no difference between hitting a  person standing in one's rear and hitting one who was pushed by a  horse within range of the stick just as it was lifted, provided  that it was not possible, under the circumstances, in the one  case to have known, in the other to have anticipated, the  proximity. In either case there is wanting the only element which  distinguishes voluntary acts from spasmodic muscular contractions  as a ground of liability. In neither of them, that is to say, has  there been an opportunity of choice with reference to the  consequence complained of,--a chance to guard against the result  which has come to pass. A choice which entails a concealed  consequence is as to that consequence no choice.    The general principle of our law is that loss from accident must  lie where it falls, and this principle is not affected by the  fact that a human being is the instrument of misfortune. But  relatively to a given human being anything is accident which he  could not fairly have been expected to contemplate as possible,  and therefore to avoid. In the language of the late Chief Justice  Nelson of New York: \"No case or principle can be found, or if  found can be maintained, subjecting an individual to liability  for [95] an act done without fault on his part.... All the cases  concede that an injury arising from inevitable accident, or,  which in law or reason is the same thing, from an act that  ordinary human care and foresight are unable to guard against, is  but the misfortune of the sufferer, and lays no foundation for  legal responsibility.\" /1/ If this were not so, any act would be  sufficient, however remote, which set in motion or opened the  door for a series of physical sequences ending in damage; such as  riding the horse, in the case of the runaway, or even coming to a  place where one is seized with a fit and strikes the plaintiff in  an unconscious spasm. Nay, why need the defendant have acted at  all, and why is it not enough that his existence has been at the  expense of the plaintiff? The requirement of an act is the  requirement that the defendant should have made a choice. But the  only possible purpose of introducing this moral element is to  make the power of avoiding the evil complained of a condition of  liability. There is no such power where the evil cannot be  foreseen. /2/ Here we reach the argument from policy, and I shall  accordingly postpone for a moment the discussion of trespasses  upon land, and of conversions, and will take up the liability for  cattle separately at a later stage.    A man need not, it is true, do this or that act, the term act  implies a choice,--but he must act somehow. Furthermore, the  public generally profits by individual activity. As action cannot  be avoided, and tends to the public good, there is obviously no  policy in throwing the hazard of what is at once desirable and  inevitable upon the actor. [96] The state might conceivably make  itself a mutual insurance company against accidents, and  distribute the burden of its citizens' mishaps among all its  members. There might be a pension for paralytics, and state aid  for those who suffered in person or estate from tempest or wild  beasts. As between individuals it might adopt the mutual  insurance principle pro tanto, and divide damages when both were  in fault, as in the rusticum judicium of the admiralty, or it  might throw all loss upon the actor irrespective of fault. The  state does none of these things, however, and the prevailing view  is that its cumbrous and expensive machinery ought not to be set  in motion unless some clear benefit is to be derived from  disturbing the status quo. State interference is an evil, where  it cannot be shown to be a good. Universal insurance, if desired,  can be better and more cheaply accomplished by private  enterprise. The undertaking to redistribute losses simply on the  ground that they resulted from the defendant's act would not only  be open to these objections, but, as it is hoped the preceding  discussion has shown, to the still graver one of offending the  sense of justice. Unless my act is of a nature to threaten  others, unless under the circumstances a prudent man would have  foreseen the possibility of harm, it is no more justifiable to  make me indemnify my neighbor against the consequences, than to  make me do the same thing if I had fallen upon him in a fit, or  to compel me to insure him against lightning.    I must now recur to the conclusions drawn from innocent  trespasses upon land, and conversions, and the supposed analogy  of those cases to trespasses against the person, lest the law  concerning the latter should be supposed to lie between two  antinomies, each necessitating with equal cogency an opposite  conclusion to the other.    [97] Take first the case of trespass upon land attended by actual  damage. When a man goes upon his neighbor's land, thinking it is  his own, he intends the very act or consequence complained of. He  means to intermeddle with a certain thing in a certain way, and  it is just that intended intermeddling for which he is sued. /1/  Whereas, if he accidentally hits a stranger as he lifts his staff  in self defence, the fact, which is the gist of the  action,--namely, the contact between the staff and his neighbor's  head,--was not intended, and could not have been foreseen. It  might be answered, to be sure, that it is not for intermeddling  with property, but for intermeddling with the plaintiff's  property, that a man is sued; and that in the supposed cases,  just as much as in that of the accidental blow, the defendant is  ignorant of one of the facts making up the total environment, and  which must be present to make his action wrong. He is ignorant,  that is to say, that the true owner either has or claims any  interest in the property in question, and therefore he does not  intend a wrongful act, because he does not mean to deal with his  neighbor's property. But the answer to this is, that he does  intend to do the damage complained of. One who diminishes the  value of property by intentional damage knows it belongs to  somebody. If he thinks it belongs to himself, he expects whatever  harm he may do to come out of his own pocket. It would be odd if  he were to get rid of the burden by discovering that it belonged  to his neighbor. It is a very different thing to say that he who  intentionally does harm must bear the loss, from saying that one  from whose acts harm follows accidentally, as [98] a consequence  which could not have been foreseen, must bear it.    Next, suppose the act complained of is an exercise of dominion  over the plaintiff's property, such as a merely technical  trespass or a conversion. If the defendant thought that the  property belonged to himself, there seems to be no abstract  injustice in requiring him to know the limits of his own titles,  or, if he thought that it belonged to another, in holding him  bound to get proof of title before acting. Consider, too, what  the defendant's liability amounts to, if the act, whether an  entry upon land or a conversion of chattels, has been unattended  by damage to the property, and the thing has come back to the  hands of the true owner. The sum recovered is merely nominal, and  the payment is nothing more than a formal acknowledgment of the  owner's title; which, considering the effect of prescription and  statutes of limitation upon repeated acts of dominion, is no more  than right. /1/ All semblance of injustice disappears when the  defendant is allowed to avoid the costs of an action by tender or  otherwise.    But suppose the property has not come back to the hands of the  true owner. If the thing remains in the hands of the defendant,  it is clearly right"]]]
