That could not be allowed to pass; the error  must be rectified.  And yet! . . . And yet this very error must be  cleared up before she could make her full wish apparent.  She seemed to  find herself compelled by inexorable circumstances into an unlooked-for  bluntness.  In any case she must face the situation.  Her pluck did not  fail her; it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that she  turned to her companion and said:    'Leonard, I did not quite mean that.  It would be a pleasure to me to be  of that or any other service to you, if I might be so happy!  But I never  meant to allude to your debts.   Oh! Leonard, can't you understand!  If  you were my husband--or--or going to be, all such little troubles would  fall away from you.  But I would not for the world have you think . . . '    Her very voice failed her.  She could not speak what was in her mind; she  turned away, hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to burn.  This, she thought, was the time for a true lover's opportunity!  Oh, if  she had been a man, and a woman had so appealed, how he would have sprung  to her side and taken her in his arms, and in a wild rapture of declared  affection have swept away all the pain of her shame!    But she remained alone.  There was no springing to her side; no rapture  of declared affection; no obliteration of her shame.  She had to bear it  all alone.  There, in the open; under the eyes that she would fain have  seen any other phase of her distress.  Her heart beat loud and fast; she  waited to gain her self-control.    Leonard Everard had his faults, plenty of them, and he was in truth  composed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen thought; but he  had been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk.  He did not  quite understand the cause or the amount of his companion's concern; but  he could not but recognise her distress.  He realised that it had  followed hard upon her most generous intention towards himself.  He could  not, therefore, do less than try to comfort her, and he began his task in  a conventional way, but with a blundering awkwardness which was all  manlike.  He took her hand and held it in his; this much at any rate he  had learned in sitting on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances.  He said as tenderly as he could, but with an impatient gesture unseen by  her:    'Forgive me, Stephen!  I suppose I have said or done something which I  shouldn't.  But I don't know what it is; upon my honour I don't.  Anyhow,  I am truly sorry for it.  Cheer up, old girl!  I'm not your husband, you  know; so you needn't be distressed.'    Stephen took her courage _a deux mains_.  If Leonard would not speak she  must.  It was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left in its  present state.    'Leonard,' she said softly and solemnly, 'might not that some day be?'    Leonard, in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of  selfishness, was a prig of the first water.  He had been reared  altogether in convention.  Home life and Eton and Christchurch had taught  him many things, wise as well as foolish; but had tended to fix his  conviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on adamantine lines  of conventional decorum.  It never even occurred to him that a lady could  so far step from the confines of convention as to take the initiative in  a matter of affection.  In his blind ignorance he blundered brutally.  He  struck better than he knew, as, meaning only to pass safely by an awkward  conversational corner, he replied:    'No jolly fear of that!  You're too much of a boss for me!'  The words  and the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as with a  whip.  She turned for an instant as pale as ashes; then the red blood  rushed from her heart, and face and neck were dyed crimson.  It was not a  blush, it was a suffusion.  In his ignorance Leonard thought it was the  former, and went on with what he considered his teasing.    'Oh yes!  You know you always want to engineer a chap your own way and  make him do just as you wish.  The man who has the happiness of marrying  you, Stephen, will have a hard row to hoe!'  His 'chaff' with its utter  want of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung earnest condition,  nothing short of brutal, and for a few seconds produced a feeling of  repellence.  But it is in the nature of things that opposition of any  kind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature.  She  lost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose; and as this  was to win the man to her way of thinking, she took the logical course of  answering his argument.  If Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to  stimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a  better way.  It came somewhat as a surprise to Stephen, when she heard  her own words:    'I would make a good wife, Leonard!  A husband whom I loved and honoured  would, I think, not be unhappy!'  The sound of her own voice speaking  these words, though the tone was low and tender and more self-suppressing  by far than was her wont, seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears.  Her last bolt seemed to have sped.  The blood rushed to her head, and she  had to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would have fallen  forward.    The time seemed long before Leonard spoke again; every second seemed an  age.  She seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of his  voice; it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say:    'You limit yourself wisely, Stephen!'    'How do you mean?' she asked, making a great effort to speak.    'You would promise to love and honour; but there isn't anything about  obeying.'    As he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously, and laughed with  the intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a joke, however  inferior, of his own manufacture.  Stephen looked at him with a long look  which began in anger--that anger which comes from an unwonted sense of  impotence, and ends in tolerance, the intermediate step being admiration.  It is the primeval curse that a woman's choice is to her husband; and it  is an important part of the teaching of a British gentlewoman, knit in  the very fibres of her being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand  years, that she be true to him.  The man who has in his person the  necessary powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife, even for a  passing moment, has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the  deadliest arts of mankind.    Leonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his ease  on that summer morning.  Tall, straight, supple; a typical British  gentleman of the educated class, with all parts of the body properly  developed and held in some kind of suitable poise.    As Stephen looked, the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed to  pass.  She realised that here was a nature different from her own, and  which should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself; and the  conviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more easy as  well as more natural to her.  Perhaps for the first time in her life  Stephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a  standard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment.  Her recognition might  have been summed up in the thought which ran through her mind:    'One must be a little lenient with a man one loves!'    Stephen, when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work  within her, felt immediately its calming influence.  It was with brighter  thoughts and better humour that she went on with her task.  A task only,  it seemed now; a means to an end which she desired.    'Leonard, tell me seriously, why do you think I gave you the trouble of  coming out here?'    'Upon my soul, Stephen, I don't know.'    'You don't seem to care either, lolling like that when I am serious!'  The  words were acid, but the tone was soft and friendly, familiar and  genuine, putting quite a meaning of its own on them.  Leonard looked at  her indolently:    'I like to loll.'    'But can't you even guess, or try to guess, what I ask you?'    'I can't guess.  The day's too hot, and that shanty with the drinks is  not built yet.'    'Or may never be!'  Again he looked at her sleepily.    'Never be!  Why not?'    'Because, Leonard, it may depend on you.'    'All right then.  Drive on!  Hurry up the architect and the  jerry-builder!'    A quick blush leaped to Stephen's cheeks.  The words were full of  meaning, though the tone lacked something; but the news was too good.  She  could not accept it at once; she decided to herself to wait a short time.  Ere many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went  on:    'I hope you'll give me a say before that husband of yours comes along.  He  might be a blue-ribbonite; and it wouldn't do to start such a shanty for  rot-gut!'    Again a cold wave swept over her.  The absolute difference of feeling  between the man and herself; his levity against her earnestness, his  callous blindness to her purpose, even the commonness of his words  chilled her.  For a few seconds she wavered again in her intention; but  once again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her  back to her path.  With chagrin she felt that her words almost stuck in  her throat, as summoning up all her resolution she went on:    'It would be for you I would have it built, Leonard!'  The man sat up  quickly.    'For me?' he asked in a sort of wonderment.    'Yes, Leonard, for you and me!'  She turned away; her blushes so overcame  her that she could not look at him.  When she faced round again he was  standing up, his back towards her.    She stood up also.  He was silent for a while; so long that the silence  became intolerable, and she spoke:    'Leonard, I am waiting!'  He turned round and said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#16)"],[1,"or pain, or  a mingling of these.    The man of desire wins from his works the reward of pleasure, or  incurs the penalty of pain; or, as so often happens in life, his guerdon,  like the passionate mood of the lover, is part pleasure and part pain.  Works done with self-seeking bear within them the seeds of future  sorrow; conversely, according to the proverb, present pain is future  gain.    But, for him who has gone beyond desire, whose desire is set on the  Eternal, neither pain to be avoided nor pleasure to be gained inspires  his work. He fears no hell and desires no heaven. His one desire is, to  know the will of the Father and finish His work. He comes directly in  line with the divine Will, and works cleanly and immediately, without  longing or fear. His heart dwells in the Eternal; all his desires are set  on the Eternal.    8. From the force inherent in works comes the manifestation of those  dynamic mind images which are conformable to the ripening out of  each of these works.    We are now to consider the general mechanism of Karma, in order  that we may pass on to the consideration of him who is free from  Karma. Karma, indeed, is the concern of the personal man, of his  bondage or freedom. It is the succession of the forces which built up  the personal man, reproducing themselves in one personality after  another.    Now let us take an imaginary case, to see how these forces may work  out. Let us think of a man, with murderous intent in his heart, striking  with a dagger at his enemy. He makes a red wound in his victim's  breast; at the same instant he paints, in his own mind, a picture of that  wound: a picture dynamic with all the fierce will-power he has put  into his murderous blow. In other words he has made a deep wound  in his own psychic body; and, when he comes to be born again, that  body will become his outermost vesture, upon which, with its wound  still there, bodily tissue will be built up. So the man will be born  maimed, or with the predisposition to some mortal injury; he is  unguarded at that point, and any trifling accidental blow will pierce the  broken Joints of his psychic armour. Thus do the dynamic  mind-images manifest themselves, coming to the surface, so that  works done in the past may ripen and come to fruition.    9. Works separated by different nature, or place, or time, are brought  together by the correspondence between memory and dynamic  impression.    Just as, in the ripening out of mind-images into bodily conditions, the  effect is brought about by the ray of creative force sent down by the  Self, somewhat as the light of the magic lantern projects the details of  a picture on the screen, revealing the hidden, and making secret things  palpable and visible, so does this divine ray exercise a selective power  on the dynamic mind-images, bringing together into one day of life the  seeds gathered from many days. The memory constantly exemplifies  this power; a passage of poetry will call up in the mind like passages  of many poets, read at different times. So a prayer may call up many  prayers.    In like manner, the same over-ruling selective power, which is a ray  of the Higher Self, gathers together from different births and times and  places those mind-images which are conformable, and may be grouped  in the frame of a single life or a single event. Through this grouping,  visible bodily conditions or outward circumstances are brought about,  and by these the soul is taught and trained.    Just as the dynamic mind-images of desire ripen out in bodily  conditions and circumstances, so the far more dynamic powers of  aspiration, wherein the soul reaches toward the Eternal, have their  fruition in a finer world, building the vesture of the spiritual man.    10. The series of dynamic mind-images is beginningless, because  Desire is everlasting.    The whole series of dynamic mind-images, which make up the entire  history of the personal man, is a part of the mechanism which the Self  employs, to mirror itself in a reflection, to embody its powers in an  outward form, to the end of self-expression, selfrealization,  self-knowledge. Therefore the initial impulse behind these dynamic  mind-images comes from the Self and is the descending ray of the  Self; so that it cannot be said that there is any first member of the  series of images, from which the rest arose. The impulse is  beginningless, since it comes from the Self, which is from everlasting.  Desire is not to cease; it is to turn to the Eternal, and so become  aspiration.    11. Since the dynamic mind-images are held together by impulses of  desire, by the wish for personal reward, by the substratum of mental  habit, by the support of outer things desired; therefore, when these  cease, the self reproduction of dynamic mind-images ceases.    We are still concerned with the personal life in its bodily vesture, and  with the process whereby the forces which have upheld it are  gradually transferred to the life of the spiritual man, and build up for  him his finer vesture in a finer world.    How is the current to be changed? How is the flow of  self-reproductive mind-images, which have built the conditions of life  after life in this world of bondage, to be checked, that the time of  imprisonment may come to an end, the day of liberation dawn?    The answer is given in the Sutra just translated. The driving-force is  withdrawn and directed to the upbuilding of the spiritual body.    When the building impulses and forces are withdrawn, the tendency  to manifest a new psychical body, a new body of bondage, ceases with  them.    12. The difference between that which is past and that which is not yet  come, according to their natures, depends on the difference of phase  of their properties.    Here we come to a high and difficult matter, which has always been  held to be of great moment in the Eastern wisdom: the thought that  the division of time into past, present and future is, in great measure,  an illusion; that past, present, future all dwell together in the eternal  Now.    The discernment of this truth has been held to be so necessarily a part  of wisdom, that one of the names of the Enlightened is: \"he who has  passed beyond the three times: past, present, future.\"    So the Western Master said: \"Before Abraham was, I am\"; and again,  \"I am with you always, unto the end of the world\"; using the eternal  present for past and future alike. With the same purpose, the Master  speaks of himself as \"the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the  end, the first and the last.\"    And a Master of our own days writes: \"I feel even irritated at having  to use these three clumsy words--past, present, and future. Miserable  concepts of the objective phases of the subjective whole, they are  about as ill adapted for the purpose, as an axe for fine carving.\"    In the eternal Now, both past and future are consummated.    Bjorklund, the Swedish philosopher, has well stated the same truth:    \"Neither past nor future can exist to God; He lives undividedly,  without limitations, and needs not, as man, to plot out his existence in  a series of moments. Eternity then is not identical with unending time;  it is a different form of existence, related to time as the perfect to the  imperfect ... Man as an entity for himself must have the natural  limitations for the part. Conceived by God, man is eternal in the divine  sense, but conceived, by himself, man's eternal life is clothed in the  limitations we call time. The eternal is a constant present without  beginning or end, without past or future.\"    13. These properties, whether manifest or latent, are of the nature of  the Three Potencies.    The Three Potencies are the three manifested modifications of the one  primal material, which stands opposite to perceiving consciousness.  These Three Potencies are called Substance, Force, Darkness; or  viewed rather for their moral colouring, Goodness, Passion, Inertness.  Every material manifestation is a projection of substance into the  empty space of darkness. Every mental state is either good, or  passional, or inert. So, whether subjective or objective, latent or  manifest, all things that present themselves to the perceiving  consciousness are compounded of these three. This is a fundamental  doctrine of the Sankhya system.    14. The external manifestation of an object takes place when the  transformations ore in the same phase.    We should be inclined to express the same law by saying, for example,  that a sound is audible, when it consists of vibrations within the  compass of the auditory nerve; that an object is visible, when either  directly or by reflection, it sends forth luminiferous vibrations within  the compass of the retina and the optic nerve. Vibrations below or  above that compass make no impression at all, and the object remains  invisible; as, for example, a kettle of boiling water in a dark room,  though the kettle is sending forth heat vibrations closely akin to light.    So, when the vibrations of the object and those of the perceptive  power are in the same phase, the external manifestation of the object  takes place.    There seems to be a further suggestion that the appearance of an  object in the \"present,\" or its remaining hid in the \"past,\" or \"future,\"  is likewise a question of phase, and, just as the range of vibrations  perceived might be increased by the development of finer senses, so  the perception of things past, and things to come, may be easy from  a higher point of view.    15. The paths of material things and of states of consciousness are  distinct, as is manifest from the fact that the same object may produce  different impressions in different minds.    Having shown that our bodily condition and circumstances depend on  Karma, while Karma depends on perception and will, the sage  recognizes the fact that from this may be drawn the false deduction  that material things are"]]]
