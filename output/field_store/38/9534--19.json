Buck's close association with church work has naturally led him  chiefly into sacred music, and in this class of composition he is by  many authorities accorded the very highest place among American  composers. He has also written many organ solos, sonatas, marches, a  pastorale, a rondo caprice, and many concert transcriptions, as well  as a group of etudes for pedal phrasing, and several important  treatises on various musical topics. His two \"Motett Collections\" were  a refreshing relief and inspiration to church choirs thirsty for  religious Protestant music of some depth and warmth.    In the cantata form Buck also holds a foremost place. In 1876 he was  honored with a commission to set to music \"The Centennial Meditation  of Columbia,\" a poem written for the occasion by the Southern poet,  Sidney Lanier. This was performed at the opening of the Philadelphia  Exhibition by a chorus of one thousand voices, an organ, and an  orchestra of two hundred pieces under the direction of Theodore  Thomas. In 1874 he made a metrical version of \"The Legend of Don  Munio\" from Irving's \"Alhambra,\" and set it to music for a small  orchestra and chorus. Its adaptability to the resources of the vocal  societies of smaller cities has made it one of his most popular works.    Another bit of Washington Irving is found in Buck's cantata, \"The  Voyage of Columbus,\" the libretto for which he has taken from Irving's  \"Life of Columbus.\" It consists of six night-scenes,--\"The Chapel of  St. George at Palos,\" \"On the Deck of the _Santa Maria_,\" \"The Vesper  Hymn,\" \"Mutiny,\" \"In Distant Andalusia,\" and \"Land and Thanksgiving.\"  The opportunities here for Buck's skilful handling of choruses and his  dramatic feeling in solos are obvious, and the work has been  frequently used both in this country and in Germany with much success.  Buck, in fact, made the German libretto as well as the English, and  has written the words for many of his compositions. His largest work  was \"The Light of Asia,\" composed in 1885 and based on Sir Edwin  Arnold's epic. It requires two and one-half hours for performance and  has met the usual success of Buck's music; it was produced in London  with such soloists as Nordica, Lloyd, and Santley. It has been  occasionally given here.    He has found the greater part of his texts in American poetry,  particularly in Lanier, Stedman, and Longfellow, whose \"King Olaf's  Christmas\" and \"Nun of Nidaros\" he has set to music, as well as his  \"Golden Legend,\" which won a prize of one thousand dollars at the  Cincinnati Festival in a large competition. His work is analyzed very  fully in A.J. Goodrich' \"Musical Analysis.\"    [Music:        High in the purer air,      High as the heart's desire,      In a passion of longing and fire,      A bird sings sweet and fair;      While a sunbeam, cheery and strong,      Answers the joy of the song,      And Spring, fair Spring is coming!    Copyright, 1893, by G. Schirmer.    FRAGMENT FROM \"SPRING'S AWAKENING,\" BY MR. BUCK.]    Here, as in his symphonic overture to Scott's \"Marmion,\" Buck has  adopted the Wagnerian idea of the _leit-motif_ as a vivid means of  distinguishing musically the various characters and their varying  emotions. His music is not markedly Wagnerian, however, in other  ways, but seems to show, back of his individuality, an assimilation of  the good old school of canon and fugue, with an Italian tendency to  the declamatory and well-rounded melodic period.    It might be wished that in his occasional secular songs Buck had  followed less in the steps of the Italian aria and the English ballad  and adopted more of the newer, nobler spirit of the _Lied_ as Schumann  and Franz represent it, and as many of our younger Americans have done  with thorough success and not a little of exaltation. Note for  instance the inadequacy of the old-style balladry to both its own  opportunity and the otherwise-smothered fire of such a poem as Sidney  Lanier's \"Sunset,\" which is positively Shakespearean in its passionate  perfection.    In religious music, however, Mr. Buck has made a niche of its own for  his music, which it occupies with grace and dignity.      _Horatio W. Parker._    [Illustration: Autograph of Horatio W. Parker]    [Illustration: HORATIO W. PARKER.]    When one considers the enormous space occupied by the hymn-tune in New  England musical activity, it is small wonder that most of its  composers should display hymnal proclivities. Both Buck and Parker  are natives of New England.    Parker was born, September 15, 1863, at Auburndale, Mass. His mother  was his first teacher of music. She was an organist, and gave him a  thorough technical schooling which won the highest commendation later  from Rheinberger, who entrusted to him the first performance of a new  organ concerto. After some study in Boston under Stephen A. Emery,  John Orth, and G.W. Chadwick, Parker went to Munich at the age of  eighteen, where he came under the special favor of Rheinberger, and  where various compositions were performed by the Royal Music School  orchestra. After three years of Europe, he returned to America and  assumed the direction of the music at St. Paul's school. He has held  various posts since, and has been, since 1894, the Battell Professor  of Music at Yale.    His rather imposing list of works includes a symphony (1885), an  operetta, a concert overture (1884), an overture, \"Regulus\" (1885),  performed in Munich and in London, and an overture, \"Count Robert of  Paris\" (1890), performed in New York, a ballad for chorus and  orchestra, \"King Trojan,\" presented in Munich in 1885, the  Twenty-third Psalm for female chorus and orchestra (1884), an \"Idylle\"  (1891); \"The Normans,\" \"The Kobolds,\" and \"Harold Harfager,\" all for  chorus and orchestra, and all dated 1891; an oratorio, three or more  cantatas, and various bits of chamber-music. His opus number has  already reached forty-three, and it is eked out to a very small degree  by such imponderous works as organ and piano solos, hymns, and songs.  In 1893, Parker won the National Conservatory prize for a cantata, and  in 1898 the McCagg prize for an a cappella chorus.    Parker's piano compositions and secular songs are not numerous. They  seem rather the incidental byplays and recreations of a fanry chiefly  turned to sacred music of the larger forms.    Opus 19 consists of \"Four Sketches,\" of which the \"Etude Melodieuse\"  is as good as is necessary in that overworked style, wherein a thin  melody is set about with a thinner ripple of arpeggios. The \"Romanza\"  is lyric and delightful, while the \"Scherzino\" is delicious and crisp  as celery; it is worthy of Schumann, whom it suggests, and many of  whose cool tones and mannerisms it borrows.    The \"5 Morceaux Characteristiques\" are on the whole better. The  \"Scherzo\" is shimmering with playfulness, and, in the Beethoven  fashion, has a tender intermezzo amoroso. This seriousness is enforced  with an ending of a most plaintive nature. The \"Caprice\" is brilliant  and whimsical, with some odd effects in accent. The \"Gavotte\" makes  unusual employment of triplets, but lacks the precious yeast of  enthusiasm necessary to a prime gavotte.    This enthusiasm is not lacking however from his \"Impromptu,\" and it  makes his \"Elegie\" a masterly work, possibly his best in the smaller  lines. This piece is altogether elegiac in spirit, intense in its  sombrest depths, impatient with wild outcries,--like Chopin's \"Funeral  March,\"--and working up to an immense passion at the end. This  subsides in ravishingly liquid arpeggios,--\"melodious tears\"?--which  obtain the kindred effect of Chopin's tinkling \"Berceuse\" in a  slightly different way. This notable work is marred by an interlude in  which the left hand mumbles harshness in the bass, while the right  hand is busy with airy fioriture. It is too close a copy of the finish  of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" sonata. The  lengthening skips of the left hand are also Beethovenesque trademarks.    Parker is rather old-fashioned in his forms of musical speech. That  is, he has what you might call the narrative style. He follows his  theme as an absorbing plot, engaging enough in itself, without  gorgeous digressions and pendent pictures. His work has something of  the Italian method. A melody or a theme, he seems to think, is only  marred by abstruse harmony, and is endangered by diversions. One might  almost say that a uniform lack of attention to color-possibilities and  a monotonous fidelity to a cool, gray tone characterize him. His  fondness for the plain, cold octave is notable. It is emphasized by  the ill-success of his \"Six Lyrics for Piano, without octaves.\" They  are all of thin value, and the \"Novelette\" is dangerously  Schumannesque.    The \"Three Love Songs\" are happy, \"Love's Chase\" keeping up the arch  raillery and whim of Beddoe's verse. \"Orsame's Song\" is smooth and  graceful, ending with a well-blurted, abrupt \"The devil take her!\" The  \"Night-piece to Julia\" is notable. We have no poet whose lyrics are  harder to set to music than good Robin Herrick's. They have a lilt of  their own that is incompatible with ordinary music. Parker has,  however, been completely successful in this instance. A mysterious,  night-like carillon accompaniment, delicate as harebells, gives sudden  way to a superb support of a powerful outburst at the end of the song.    [Music:        The stars of the night      Will lend thee their light,      Like tapers without number.      Then, Julia let me woo thee,      Thus to come unto me;      And when I shall meet      Thy silvery feet      My soul I'll pour into thee,      My soul I'll pour into thee, into thee.

The selling of goods or property which is _unsound and defective_,  under direct professions that it is sound and good, is another variety  of this species of fraud. It is sometimes done by direct lying, and  sometimes by indefinite and hypocritical insinuations. Agents, and  retailers often assert their wares to be good, because those of whom  they have received them _declare_ them to be such. These declarations  are often believed, because the seller appears or professes to believe  them; while in truth, he may not give them the least credit.    One of the grossest impositions of this kind--common as it is--is  practised upon the public in advertising and selling nostrums as safe  and valuable medicines. These are ushered into newspapers with a long  train of pompous declarations, almost always false, and _always_  delusive. The silly purchaser buys and uses the medicine chiefly or  solely because it is sold by a respectable man, under the sanction of  advertisements to which that respectable man lends his countenance.  Were good men to decline this wretched employment, the medicines would  probably soon fall into absolute discredit; and health and limbs and  life would, in many instances, be preserved from unnecessary  destruction.    4. Another species of fraud consists in _concealing the defects_ of  what we sell. This is the general art and villany of that class of men,  commonly called _jockeys_; a class which, in reality, embraces some who  would startle at the thought of being such;--and whole multitudes who  would receive the appellation with disdain.    The common subterfuge of the jockey is, that he gives no false  accounts; that the purchaser has eyes of his own, and must judge of the  goods for himself. No defence can be more lame and wretched; and hardly  any more impudent.    No purchaser can possibly discover many of the defects in commodities;  he is therefore obliged to depend on the seller for information  concerning them. All this the seller well knows, and if an honest man,  will give the information. Now as no purchaser would buy the articles,  if he knew their defects, except at a reduced price, whenever the  seller does not give this information, and the purchaser is _taken in_,  it is by downright villany, whatever some may pretend to the contrary.  Nor will the common plea, that if they buy a bad article, they have a  right to sell it again as well as they can, ever justify the wretched  practice of selling defective goods, at the full value of those which  are more perfect.    5. A fraud, still meaner, is practised, when we endeavor to _lower the  value of such commodities as we wish to buy_. 'It is naught, it is  naught, says the buyer, but when he hath gone his way he boasteth,' is  as applicable to our times, as to those of Solomon. The ignorant, the  modest, and the necessitous--persons who should be the last to suffer  from fraud,--are, in this way, often made victims. A decisive tone and  confident airs, in men better dressed, and who are sometimes supposed  to know better than themselves, easily bear down persons so  circumstanced, and persuade them to sell their commodities for less  than they are really worth.    Young shopkeepers are often the dupes of this species of treatment.  Partly with a view to secure the future custom of the stranger, and  partly in consequence of his statements that he can buy a similar  article elsewhere at a much lower price, (when perhaps the quality of  the other is vastly inferior) they not unfrequently sell goods at a  positive sacrifice--and what do they gain by it? The pleasure of being  laughed at by the purchaser, as soon as he is out of sight, for  suffering themselves to be _beaten down_, as the phrase is; and of  having him boast of his bargain, and trumpet abroad, without a blush,  the value of the articles which he had just been decrying!    6. I mention the use of _false weights and measures_ last, not because  it is a less heinous fraud, but because I hope it is less frequently  practised than many others. But it is a lamentable truth that weights  and measures are _sometimes_ used when they are _known_ to be false;  and quite often when they are _suspected_ to be so. More frequently  still, they are used when they have been permitted to become defective  through inattention. They are often formed of perishable materials. To  meet this there are in most of our communities, officers appointed to  be sealers of weights and measures. When the latter are made of  substances known to be liable to decay or wear, the proprietor is  unpardonable if he does not have them frequently and thoroughly  examined.    I have only adverted to some of the more common kinds of fraud; such as  the young are daily, and often hourly exposed to, and against which it  is especially important, not only to their own reputation, but to their  success in business, that they should be on their guard. I will just  _enumerate_ a few others, for my limits preclude the possibility of any  thing more than a bare enumeration.    1. Suffering borrowed articles to be injured by our negligence. 2.  Detaining them in our possession longer than the lender had reason to  expect. 3. Employing them for purposes not contemplated by the lender.  4. The returning of an article of inferior value, although in  _appearance_ like that which was borrowed. 5. Passing suspected bank  bills, or depreciated counterfeit or clipped coin. Some persons are so  conscientious on this point, that they will sell a clipped piece for  _old metal_, rather than pass it. But such rigid honesty is rather  rare. 6. The use of pocket money, by the young, in a manner different  from that which was known to be contemplated by the parent, or master  who furnished it. 7. The employment of time in a different manner from  what was intended; the mutilating, by hacking, breaking, soiling, or in  any other manner wantonly injuring buildings, fences, and other  property, public or private;--and especially crops and fruit trees. 8.  Contracting debts, though ever so small, without the almost certain  prospect of being able to pay them. 9. Neglecting to pay them at the  time expected. 10. Paying in something of less value than we ought. 11.  Breaches of trust. 12. Breaking of promises. 13. Overtrading by means  of borrowed capital.      SECTION III. _Method in Business._    There is one class of men who are of inestimable value to society--and  the more so from their scarcity;--I mean _men of business_. It is true  you could hardly offer a greater insult to most persons than to say  they are not of this class; but you cannot have been very observing not  to have learned, that they who most deserve the charge will think  themselves the most insulted by it.    Nothing contributes more to despatch, as well as safety and success in  business, than method and regularity. Let a person set down in his  memorandum book, every morning, the several articles of business that  ought to be done during the day; and beginning with the first person he  is to call upon, or the first place he is to go to, finish that affair,  if possible, before he begins another; and so on with the rest.    A man of business, who observes this method, will hardly ever find  himself hurried or disconcerted by forgetfulness. And he who sets down  all his transactions in writing, and keeps his accounts, and the whole  state of his affairs, in a distinct and accurate order, so that at any  time, by looking into his books, he can see in what condition his  concerns are, and whether he is in a thriving or declining way;--such a  one, I say, deserves properly the character of a man of business; and  has a pretty fair prospect of success in his plans.[6] But such  exactness seldom suits the man of pleasure. He has other things in his  head.    The way to transact a great deal of business in a little time, and to  do it well, is to observe three rules. 1. Speak to the point. 2. Use no  more words than are necessary, fully to express your meaning. 3. Study  beforehand, and set down in writing afterwards, a sketch of the  transaction.    To enable a person to _speak_ to the point, he must have acquired, as  one essential pre-requisite, the art of _thinking_ to the point. To  effect these objects, or rather _this_ object, as they constitute in  reality but _one_, is the legitimate end of the study of grammar; of  the importance of which I am to speak elsewhere. This branch is almost  equally indispensable in following the other two rules; but here, a  thorough knowledge of numbers, as well as of language, will be demanded.          [6] A gentleman of my acquaintance assures me that he always        leaves his books, accounts, &c., in so complete a state, on going        to bed, that if he should die during the night, every thing could        be perfectly understood. This rule he adheres to, as a matter of        duty; not only to his fellow men, but to God.      SECTION IV. _Application to Business._    There is one piece of prudence, above all others, absolutely necessary  to those who expect to raise themselves in the world by an employment  of any kind; I mean a constant, unwearied application to the main  pursuit. By means of persevering diligence, joined to frugality, we see  many people in the lowest and most laborious stations in life, raise  themselves to such circumstances as will allow them, in their old age,  that relief from _excessive_ anxiety and toil which are necessary to  make the decline of life easy and comfortable.    Burgh mentions a merchant, who, at first setting out, opened and shut  his shop every day for several weeks together, without selling goods to  the value of two cents; who by the force of application for a course of  years, rose, at last, to a handsome fortune. But I have known many who  had a variety of opportunities for settling themselves comfortably in  the world, yet, for want of steadiness to carry any scheme"]]]
