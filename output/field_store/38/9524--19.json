Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, but his eye was  not dim nor had he lost his strength. The Israelites wept for Moses on  the plain of Moab thirty days, and then the days of weeping and mourning  for Moses were ended.    Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses  had laid his hands upon him; and the Israelites listened to him and did  as Jehovah commanded Moses. But in Israel no prophet had yet arisen whom  Jehovah knew as well as he did Moses.      CROSSING THE RIVER JORDAN    After the death of Moses, Jehovah said to Joshua, Moses' helper, \"Moses  my servant is dead: Now arise, go over the Jordan with all this people  to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites. As long as you  live no one will be able to stand against you. As I was with Moses, so I  shall be with you: I will not fail you nor forsake you. Be brave and  strong, for you shall give this people the land which I solemnly  promised their fathers I would give them. Only be brave and strong to  keep faithfully all the law, as Moses my servant commanded you. Turn not  from it to the right nor to the left, and you shall have success  wherever you go. Have I not commanded you? Be brave and strong; fear not  nor be afraid, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.\"    Then Joshua gave this order to the officers who were over the people:  \"Go through all the camp and give this command: 'Prepare food for  yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in  and take the land which Jehovah your God has given you as your own.'\"    While Joshua was at Shittim, he secretly sent two men as spies, with the  command: \"Go, explore the land and especially Jericho.\" So they went and  entered the house of a woman named Rahab, and stayed there.    It was reported to the king of Jericho, \"Some men came here to-night  from the Israelites to explore the land.\" Therefore the king of Jericho  sent to Rahab and said, \"Bring out the men who entered your house, for  they have come to explore all the land.\"    Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; so she said, \"It is  true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from. When  the time came to shut the gate at night, the men went out and I do not  know where they have gone. Follow after them quickly, for you may  overtake them.\" She, however, had brought them up to the roof and hidden  them with the stalks of flax which she had spread out there. So the men  of Jericho followed after them in the direction of the fords of the  Jordan; and as soon as the men of Jericho had gone out, the gate was  closed.    The spies had hardly lain down when Rahab came up to them on the roof  and said, \"I know that Jehovah has given you the land and that fear of  you has seized us and that because of you all who live in the land are  losing heart. Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have treated  you with kindness, that you will also treat my family kindly, and  promise me that you will save the lives of my father, my mother, my  brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will not  put us to death.\" The men said to her, \"We are ready to give our lives  for you, if you do not tell what we are doing; and when Jehovah gives us  the land, we will treat you kindly and faithfully.\"    Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house in  which she lived was built into the city wall. She said to them, \"Go  into the hills, that the men who are looking for you may not find you,  and hide yourselves there three days until they have returned. Then you  may go on your way.\"    The men said to her, \"We shall be free from our solemn promise to you,  unless, when we come into the land, you bind this cord of scarlet thread  in the window through which you let us down and gather your father, your  mother, your brothers, and all your family into your house. If any one  goes out of the doors of your house into the street, he shall be  responsible for his death and we shall be innocent. If any one stays  with you in the house, we will be responsible for his death if any one  lays hands on him. But if you tell what we are doing, we shall be free  from our solemn promise to you.\" She replied, \"It shall be as you say.\"  So she sent them away. And when they were gone, she bound the scarlet  cord in the window.    So they left and went into the hills and stayed there three days until  those who were looking for them had returned. They sought for them in  every direction but did not find them. Then the two men came down from  the hills, crossed the river, and came to Joshua and told him all that  had happened to them.    Joshua rose up early in the morning and set out from Shittim. And he and  all the Israelites came to the Jordan and spent the night there before  crossing. And Joshua said to the people, \"Consecrate yourselves, for  to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders among you. Come and hear the words of  Jehovah your God. By this you shall know that a living God is with you:  the ark of the Lord of all the earth is about to pass over before you  into the Jordan. When the priests who bear the ark of the Lord of all  the earth step into the waters of the Jordan, its waters shall be cut  off, so that the waters that come down from above will stand still in a  heap.\"    So when the people left their tents to pass over the Jordan, the  priests, who were carrying the ark were in front of them. And when the  bearers of the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who  were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water--for the Jordan  overflows all its banks during the harvest time--the waters that came  down from above stood still and its waters rose in a heap a long  distance up the river at Adam, the city that is near Zarethan. The  waters that went down toward the Dead Sea were wholly cut off, while the  people crossed over opposite Jericho. The priests who were carrying the  ark of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan,  while all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until the whole  nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan.    When they had all crossed, Jehovah said to Joshua, \"Command them to take  from the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet  stood, twelve stones and carry them over with you and lay them down in  the camping-place, where you pass the night, that this may be a reminder  to them. Then when your children ask from time to time: 'What do these  stones mean to you?' you shall say to them, 'They are reminders that the  waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of Jehovah, when it  passed over the Jordan.' These stones shall be a constant reminder to  the Israelites.\"    So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded and took up out of the middle  of the Jordan twelve stones corresponding to the number of the tribes of  the Israelites. They carried them over with them to the place where they  camped and laid them down there.    Then the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and the river  overflowed all its banks as before.      THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO AND AI    Now Jericho had closed its gates because of the Israelites, and no one  went in or out. But Jehovah said to Joshua, \"See, I have given Jericho  to you with its king and its able warriors. You shall march around the  city, all the soldiers going about the city once. You shall do this for  six days, and on the seventh day the people shall make the attack, each  man going up straight before him.\"    Then Joshua said to the people, \"March around the city and let the armed  men pass on before the ark of Jehovah. You shall not shout the  battle-cry nor let your voice be heard; not a word shall escape from  your mouth until the day I say to you, 'Shout the battle-cry'; then you  shall shout!\"    So he had the ark of Jehovah carried around the city once; then they  returned to the camp and spent the night there. The second day they also  marched around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six  days. The seventh day they rose early at dawn and made the circuit of  the city in the same way, only on that day they marched about the city  seven times. The seventh time the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua  said to the people, \"Shout the battle-cry; for Jehovah has given you the  city. The city and all that is in it shall be sacrificed to Jehovah;  only Rahab and those who are with her in her house shall live, because  she hid the messengers whom we sent.\"    So the people shouted the battle-cry and the wall fell down and they  went straight up into the city and captured it. But Joshua spared the  lives of Rahab and her father's family and all that she had, because she  hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to explore Jericho; and they have  lived among the Israelites even to this day.    Then Joshua set out with all the warriors to go up to Ai. And he  selected thirty thousand brave soldiers and sent them out at night with  this command, \"Hide somewhere beyond the town, not very far from it, but  be ready to act. I and all the people who are with me will go toward the  town, but when they come out against us, we will flee before them. They  will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the town; for  they will say, 'They are fleeing before us.' Then you shall rise up from  where you are hiding, and take the town. When you have captured it, set  it on fire.\"    So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place where they were to  hide and placed themselves on the west side of Ai. Joshua spent that  night among the people, and rose early the next morning and gathered  them, and he went up, together with the rulers of Israel, before the  people to Ai. And the warriors who were with him went up and came before  the town. When the king of Ai saw it, the men of the town quickly rose  up and went out to fight against the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#16)"],[1,"--_Ornamentation should be natural_,--that is to  say, should in some degree express or adopt the beauty of natural  objects. This law, together with its ultimate reason, is expressed in  the statement given in the \"Stones of Venice,\" vol. i. p. 211: \"All  noble ornament is the expression of man's delight in God's work.\"    Observe, it does not hence follow that it should be an exact imitation  of, or endeavor in anywise to supersede, God's work. It may consist only  in a partial adoption of, and compliance with, the usual forms of  natural things, without at all going to the point of imitation; and it  is possible that the point of imitation may be closely reached by  ornaments, which nevertheless are entirely unfit for their place, and  are the signs only of a degraded ambition and an ignorant dexterity. Bad  decorators err as easily on the side of imitating nature, as of  forgetting her; and the question of the exact degree in which imitation  should be attempted under given circumstances, is one of the most subtle  and difficult in the whole range of criticism. I have elsewhere examined  it at some length, and have yet much to say about it; but here I can  only state briefly that the modes in which ornamentation _ought_ to fall  short of pure representation or imitation are in the main three,  namely:--    A. Conventionalism by cause of color.    B. Conventionalism by cause of inferiority.    C. Conventionalism by cause of means.    69. A. Conventionalism by cause of color.--Abstract color is not an  imitation of nature, but _is_ nature itself; that is to say, the  pleasure taken in blue or red, as such, considered as hues merely, is  the same, so long as the brilliancy of the hue is equal, whether it be  produced by the chemistry of man, or the chemistry of flowers, or the  chemistry of skies. We deal with color as with sound--so far ruling the  power of the light, as we rule the power of the air, producing beauty  not necessarily imitative, but sufficient in itself, so that, wherever  color is introduced, ornamentation may cease to represent natural  objects, and may consist in mere spots, or bands, or flamings, or any  other condition of arrangement favorable to the color.    70. B. Conventionalism by cause of inferiority.--In general,  ornamentation is set upon certain services, subjected to certain  systems, and confined within certain limits; so that its forms require  to be lowered or limited in accordance with the required relations. It  cannot be allowed to assume the free outlines, or to rise to the  perfection of imitation. Whole banks of flowers, for instance, cannot be  carved on cathedral fronts, but only narrow moldings, having some of the  characters of banks of flowers. Also, some ornaments require to be  subdued in value, that they may not interfere with the effect of others;  and all these necessary _inferiorities_ are attained by means of  departing from natural forms--it being an established law of human  admiration that what is most representative of nature shall, _caeteris  paribus_, be most attractive.    All the various kinds of ornamentation, consisting of spots, points,  twisted bands, abstract curves, and other such, owe their peculiar  character to this conventionalism \"by cause of inferiority.\"    71. C. Conventionalism by cause of means.--In every branch of art, only  so much imitation of nature is to be admitted as is consistent with the  ease of the workman and the capacities of the material. Whatever  shortcomings are appointed (for they are more than permitted, they are  in such cases appointed, and meritorious) on account of the  untractableness of the material, come under the head of \"conventionalism  by cause of means.\"    These conventionalities, then, being duly understood and accepted, in  modification of the general law, that law will be, that the glory of all  ornamentation consists in the adoption or imitation of the beauties of  natural objects, and that no work can be of high value which is not full  of this beauty. To this fourth proposition, modern architects have not  ventured to make any serious resistance. On the contrary, they seem to  be, little by little, gliding into an obscure perception of the fact,  that architecture, in most periods of the world, had sculpture upon it,  and that the said sculpture generally did represent something  intelligible. For instance, we find Mr. Huggins, of Liverpool, lately  lecturing upon architecture \"in its relations to nature and the  intellect,\"[25] and gravely informing his hearers, that \"in the Middle  Ages angels were human figures;\" that \"some of the richest ornaments of  Solomon's temple were imitated from the palm and pomegranate,\" and that  \"the Greeks followed the example of the Egyptians in selecting their  ornaments from the _plants_ of their own country.\" It is to be presumed  that the lecturer has never been in the Elgin or Egyptian room of the  British Museum, or it might have occurred to him that the Egyptians and  Greeks sometimes also selected their ornaments from the _men_ of their  own country. But we must not expect too much illumination at once; and  as we are told that, in conclusion, Mr. Huggins glanced at \"the error of  architects in neglecting the fountain of wisdom thus open to them in  nature,\" we may expect in due time large results from the discovery of a  source of wisdom so unimagined.    [Footnote 25: See \"The Builder,\" for January 12, 1854.]    72. Proposition 5th.--_Ornamentation should be thoughtful._ That is to  say, whenever you put a chisel or a pencil into a man's hand for the  purpose of enabling him to produce beauty, you are to expect of him that  he will think about what he is doing, and feel something about it, and  that the expression of this thought or feeling will be the most noble  quality in what he produces with his chisel or brush, inasmuch as the  power of thinking and feeling is the most noble thing in the man. It  will hence follow that as men do not commonly think the same thoughts  twice, you are not to require of them that they shall do the same thing  twice. You are to expect another and a different thought of them, as  soon as one thought has been well expressed.    73. Hence, therefore, it follows also that all noble ornamentation is  perpetually varied ornamentation, and that the moment you find  ornamentation unchanging, you may know that it is of a degraded kind or  degraded school. To this law, the only exceptions arise out of the uses  of monotony, as a contrast to change. Many subordinate architectural  moldings are severely alike in their various parts (though never unless  they are thoroughly subordinate, for monotony is always deathful  according to the degree of it), in order to set off change in others;  and a certain monotony or similarity must be introduced among the most  changeful ornaments in order to enhance and exhibit their own changes.    The truth of this proposition is self-evident; for no art can be noble  which is incapable of expressing thought, and no art is capable of  expressing thought which does not change. To require of an artist that  he should always reproduce the same picture, would be not one whit more  base than to require of a carver that he should always reproduce the  same sculpture.    The principle is perfectly clear and altogether incontrovertible. Apply  it to modern Greek architecture, and that architecture must cease to  exist; for it depends absolutely on copyism.    74. The sixth proposition above stated, that _Gothic ornamentation is  nobler than Greek ornamentation_, etc., is therefore sufficiently proved  by the acceptance of this one principle, no less important than  unassailable. Of all that I have to bring forward respecting  architecture, this is the one I have most at heart; for on the  acceptance of this depends the determination whether the workman shall  be a living, progressive, and happy human being, or whether he shall be  a mere machine, with its valves smoothed by heart's blood instead of  oil,--the most pitiable form of slave.    And it is with especial reference to the denial of this principle in  modern and Renaissance architecture, that I speak of that architecture  with a bitterness which appears to many readers extreme, while in  reality, so far from exaggerating, I have not grasp enough of thought  to embrace, the evils which have resulted among all the orders of  European society from the introduction of the Renaissance schools of  building, in turning away the eyes of the beholder from natural beauty,  and reducing the workman to the level of a machine. In the Gothic times,  writing, painting, carving, casting,--it mattered not what,--were all  works done by thoughtful and happy men; and the illumination of the  volume, and the carving and casting of wall and gate, employed, not  thousands, but millions, of true and noble _artists_ over all Christian  lands. Men in the same position are now left utterly without  intellectual power or pursuit, and, being unhappy in their work, they  rebel against it: hence one of the worst forms of Unchristian Socialism.  So again, there being now no nature or variety in architecture, the  multitude are not interested in it; therefore, for the present, they  have lost their taste for art altogether, so that you can no longer  trust sculpture within their reach. Consider the innumerable forms of  evil involved in the temper and taste of the existing populace of London  or Paris, as compared with the temper of the populace of Florence, when  the quarter of Santa Maria Novella received its title of \"Joyful  Quarter,\" from the rejoicings of the multitude at getting a new picture  into their church, better than the old ones;--all this difference being  exclusively chargeable on the Renaissance architecture. And then,  farther, if we remember, not only the revolutionary ravage of sacred  architecture, but the immeasurably greater destruction effected by the"]]]
