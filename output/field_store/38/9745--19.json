Once, as he passed out from the doors of the Greater  Testimony, the rector heard some one say: \"The Church would be all right  if that old mugwump was out of the pulpit.\" It went to his heart like a  barbed thorn, and stayed there.    You know, perhaps, how a remark of that sort can stay and rankle,  and make you wish you could hear it again to make sure of it, because  perhaps you didn't hear it aright, and it was a mistake after all.  Perhaps no one said it, anyway. You ought to have written it down at the  time. I have seen the Dean take down the encyclopaedia in the rectory,  and move his finger slowly down the pages of the letter M, looking for  mugwump. But it wasn't there. I have known him, in his little study  upstairs, turn over the pages of the \"Animals of Palestine,\" looking for  a mugwump. But there was none there. It must have been unknown in the  greater days of Judea.      So things went on from month to month, and from year to year, and the  debt and the charges loomed like a dark and gathering cloud on the  horizon. I don't mean to say that efforts were not made to face the  difficulty and to fight it. They were. Time after time the workers of  the congregation got together and thought out plans for the extinction  of the debt. But somehow, after every trial, the debt grew larger  with each year, and every system that could be devised turned out more  hopeless than the last.    They began, I think, with the \"endless chain\" of letters of appeal. You  may remember the device, for it was all-popular in clerical circles some  ten or fifteen years ago. You got a number of people to write each of  them three letters asking for ten cents from three each of their friends  and asking each of them to send on three similar letters. Three each  from three each, and three each more from each! Do you observe the  wonderful ingenuity of it? Nobody, I think, has forgotten how the  Willing Workers of the Church of England Church of Mariposa sat down  in the vestry room in the basement with a pile of stationery three  feet high, sending out the letters. Some, I know, will never forget it.  Certainly not Mr. Pupkin, the teller in the Exchange Bank, for it was  here that he met Zena Pepperleigh, the judge's daughter, for the  first time; and they worked so busily that they wrote out ever so many  letters--eight or nine--in a single afternoon, and they discovered  that their handwritings were awfully alike, which was one of the most  extraordinary and amazing coincidences, you will admit, in the history  of chirography.    But the scheme failed--failed utterly. I don't know why. The letters  went out and were copied broadcast and recopied, till you could see the  Mariposa endless chain winding its way towards the Rocky Mountains.  But they never got the ten cents. The Willing Workers wrote for it in  thousands, but by some odd chance they never struck the person who had  it.    Then after that there came a regular winter of effort. First of all they  had a bazaar that was got up by the Girls' Auxiliary and held in the  basement of the church. All the girls wore special costumes that were  brought up from the city, and they had booths, where there was every  imaginable thing for sale--pincushion covers, and chair covers, and sofa  covers, everything that you can think of. If the people had once started  buying them, the debt would have been lifted in no time. Even as it was  the bazaar only lost twenty dollars.    After that, I think, was the magic lantern lecture that Dean Drone gave  on \"Italy and her Invaders.\" They got the lantern and the slides up from  the city, and it was simply splendid. Some of the slides were perhaps  a little confusing, but it was all there,--the pictures of the dense  Italian jungle and the crocodiles and the naked invaders with their  invading clubs. It was a pity that it was such a bad night, snowing  hard, and a curling match on, or they would have made a lot of money  out of the lecture. As it was the loss, apart from the breaking of the  lantern, which was unavoidable, was quite trifling.      I can hardly remember all the things that there were after that. I  recollect that it was always Mullins who arranged about renting the hall  and printing the tickets and all that sort of thing. His father, you  remember, had been at the Anglican college with Dean Drone, and though  the rector was thirty-seven years older than Mullins, he leaned upon  him, in matters of business, as upon a staff; and though Mullins was  thirty-seven years younger than the Dean, he leaned against him, in  matters of doctrine, as against a rock.    At one time they got the idea that what the public wanted was not  anything instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said  that people loved to laugh. He said that if you get a lot of people all  together and get them laughing you can do anything you like with them.  Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the  English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of  readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came  mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had  once started laughing it would have been all over with them. As it was I  heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter:  they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all  the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like  bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from  smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives  not to smile.    In fact the chairman said when he put the vote of thanks that he was  sure if people had known what the lecture was to be like there would  have been a much better \"turn-out.\" But you see all that the people  had to go on was just the announcement of the name of the lecturer,  Mr. Dreery, and that he would lecture on English Humour All Seats  Twenty-five Cents. As the chairman expressed it himself, if the people  had had any idea, any idea at all, of what the lecture would be like  they would have been there in hundreds. But how could they get an idea  that it would be so amusing with practically nothing to go upon?      After that attempt things seemed to go from bad to worse. Nearly  everybody was disheartened about it. What would have happened to the  debt, or whether they would have ever paid it off, is more than I  can say, if it hadn't occurred that light broke in on Mullins in the  strangest and most surprising way you can imagine. It happened that he  went away for his bank holidays, and while he was away he happened to  be present in one of the big cities and saw how they went at it there  to raise money. He came home in such a state of excitement that he went  straight up from the Mariposa station to the rectory, valise and all,  and he burst in one April evening to where the Rural Dean was sitting  with the three girls beside the lamp in the front room, and he cried  out:    \"Mr. Drone, I've got it,--I've got a way that will clear the debt before  you're a fortnight older. We'll have a Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa!\"    But stay! The change from the depth of depression to the pinnacle of  hope is too abrupt. I must pause and tell you in another chapter of the  Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa.          FIVE. The Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa    It was Mullins, the banker, who told Mariposa all about the plan of a  Whirlwind Campaign and explained how it was to be done. He'd happened to  be in one of the big cities when they were raising money by a Whirlwind  Campaign for one of the universities, and he saw it all.    He said he would never forget the scene on the last day of it, when the  announcement was made that the total of the money raised was even more  than what was needed. It was a splendid sight,--the business men of the  town all cheering and laughing and shaking hands, and the professors  with the tears streaming down their faces, and the Deans of the  Faculties, who had given money themselves, sobbing aloud.    He said it was the most moving thing he ever saw.    So, as I said, Henry Mullins, who had seen it, explained to the others  how it was done. He said that first of all a few of the business men  got together quietly,--very quietly, indeed the more quietly the  better,--and talked things over. Perhaps one of them would dine,--just  quietly,--with another one and discuss the situation. Then these two  would invite a third man,--possibly even a fourth,--to have lunch with  them and talk in a general way,--even talk of other things part of the  time. And so on in this way things would be discussed and looked at  in different lights and viewed from different angles and then when  everything was ready they would go at things with a rush. A central  committee would be formed and sub-committees, with captains of each  group and recorders and secretaries, and on a stated day the Whirlwind  Campaign would begin.    Each day the crowd would all agree to meet at some stated place and  each lunch together,--say at a restaurant or at a club or at some eating  place. This would go on every day with the interest getting keener and  keener, and everybody getting more and more excited, till presently the  chairman would announce that the campaign had succeeded and there would  be the kind of scene that Mullins had described.    So that was the plan that they set in motion in Mariposa.      I don't wish to say too much about the Whirlwind Campaign itself. I  don't mean to say that it was a failure. On the contrary, in many ways  it couldn't have been a greater success, and yet somehow it didn't seem  to work out just as Henry Mullins had said it would.

You are bound together as      the three witnesses were, you, notwithstanding can part and meet      and meet and part again till your heads are silvered o'er with      age.\"    He then took them separately by the hand and said: \"Do you with full  purpose of heart take part in this ministry, to proclaim the Gospel  with all diligence with those your brethren, according to the tenor  and intent of the charge you have received.\" Each of them answered in  the affirmative.    Thus were chosen the first Twelve Apostles of the last dispensation.  The first quorum of Seventies, their co-laborers in the ministry, was  called into existence about the same time, its members being selected,  as the Twelve had been, from the survivors of Zion's Camp, whose faith  and integrity had been tried and proven.    The Apostles assembled from time to time to receive instructions from  the Prophet, and strengthen each other in the Lord. One evening when  they had met together for this purpose, the grand revelation on  Priesthood (now forming the first half of Section 107 of the book of  Doctrine and Covenants) was given.    Sunday, April 5th, 1835. Says Heber: \"The Twelve had not all, as yet,  been together, and as the time drew near that we should travel to the  east, we appointed this day to bear our testimony unto our brethren  and friends. We were all assembled together with the exception of  Brother Orson Pratt, who had not yet been with us. We proceeded to  speak according to our ages, the oldest speaking first. This day  Brothers Thomas B. Marsh, David W. Patten, Brigham Young and Heber C.  Kimball spoke. Sunday, 12th, Brothers Orson Hyde, William E. McLellin,  Parley P. Pratt, and Luke S. Johnson spoke. Sunday, 19th, Brothers  William Smith, John F. Boynton and Lyman E. Johnson spoke, closing the  testimony of the Twelve Apostles to the people in Kirtland at that  time. Sunday, 26th, Brother Orson Pratt entered the house while we  were opening the meeting and praying and wishing for his arrival. He  was ordained an apostle, and we received our charge from Joseph Smith,  the Prophet.\"    The eldest of the Apostles, Thos. B. Marsh, thus became president of  the quorum; though the Twelve were all equal in authority. This order  was agreeable to the will of Heaven.          CHAPTER XI.    FIRST MISSION OF THE TWELVE--HEBER REVISITS THE SCENES OF HIS  CHILDHOOD--MOBBING AN ABOLITIONIST--\"THE ACCUSER OF THE  BRETHREN\"--DAYS OF REPENTANCE AND REFORMATION.      The Apostles started on their first mission, May 4th, 1835. They  traveled through the eastern states and Upper Canada, preaching,  baptizing, setting in order the branches of the Church, counseling the  Saints to gather westward, and collecting means for the purchase of  lands in Missouri and the completion of the Lord's House in Kirtland.  Like the Apostles anciently, they went forth two by two, traveling  \"without purse or scrip,\" and preaching by the way. Heber's first  companion was William Smith, brother to the Prophet.    Separating at Dunkirk, New York, on the 5th of May, the Apostles met  in conference on the 9th, at Westfield, Chautauqua County. Here they  sat in council upon the first case brought before them for  adjudication. A local traveling Elder named Joseph Rose had been  teaching erroneous doctrine and perverting the word of God, in that he  spiritualized the literal promise of the Savior; that before His  second coming the sun should be darkened and the moon turned to blood.  Rose asserted that the Jewish church was the sun, darkened, and the  Gentile church, the moon, which should be turned to blood. He was  shown his error and reproved sharply, whereupon he humbly acknowledged  his fault.    At Mendon, his former home, Heber and his companion, Elder Orson Hyde,  were confronted by a Baptist priest named Fulton, who withstood them  harshly. Says Heber: \"He called us false prophets, and, rejecting our  testimony, advised us to go home. We declared unto him that we should  go forth preaching the Gospel, and no power should stay us. I told him  if he did not repent of his sins and be baptized for the remission of  them, he would be damned; which made him angry. We then passed on  until we came to a pure stream of water, and there cleansed our feet,  bearing testimony against him, as the Lord commanded.\"    At the Lyonstown conference, on the 6th of June, it was Heber's turn  to preside; the Twelve having been instructed by the Prophet to  preside in turn at their meetings according to their ages. From here  Elder Kimball traveled in company with Elder Luke Johnson towards  Pillowpoint, the place of the next conference. In the town of Rose  they were cordially received, but in Hewton were turned away from  twelve houses, where they had solicited entertainment. At midnight  they put up at an inn, retiring supperless to bed, as they had but one  shilling with which to pay for their lodging. A walk of six miles  before breakfast next morning brought them to Esquire David  Ellsworth's where they were warmly welcomed and hospitably  entertained. The Apostles blessed the kind souls who thus administered  to their wants, and who, on bidding them farewell, gave them money,  wished them God-speed and wept at their departure. About one year  later the whole family embraced the Gospel.    At Pillowpoint, Jefferson County, a conference was held on the 19th of  June. Here the council tried John Elmer, a member of the Church, for  holding views and doctrines opposed to the principles of truth. \"When  called upon, he stated that he had had many visions and revelations,  and that the Lord had revealed to him of a certainty that He would  make His second appearance within fifteen years; also that the Spirit  of God often came upon him and threw him down, and caused him to  disfigure himself, or die the death of the righteous, or of the  wicked, and then come to life again in the presence of others, to  convince them that he was a man of God and had great power. He also  stated that in one of his visions the Lord Jesus appeared personally  and laid His hands upon him and sanctified him, both soul and body,  and that he was now immortal or changed, so that he would never die.  He stated that he could hold red-hot iron or live coals of fire in his  hands without receiving any injury; together with other curious  notions and vagaries, ascribing them all to the power of God; and that  he never would deny them, although the Council and whole Church should  decide against him. The Council endeavored to show him that he was  deceived by the adversary, but to no effect. He said he would rather  be expelled from the Church than give up any of his views or say they  were not of God. Consequently the Church lifted their hands against  him.\"    While at Sackett's Harbor, Heber received a letter from his wife,  apprising him of the birth of his son, Heber P., at Kirtland, on the  1st of June. His joy found vent in a characteristic burst of humor. He  propounded the following riddle to the brethren: \"I have three  children now, and have not seen one of them.\" This was quite a puzzle  to them, until he explained that the _one_ he referred to was the  infant born since he left home.    He next visited his native state, Vermont, and remained several days  among the scenes of his childhood, visiting and preaching to his  relatives and acquaintances, and wherever opportunity arose. Some  believed, but did not obey the Gospel. A false prophet named Davison  had gone through the country some time before, deceiving the people  with pretended miracles. They were therefore prejudiced against the  true faith, with its new and strange promises of spiritual gifts and  blessings.    Crossing over the Green Mountains, taking a bypath through a lonely  and densely timbered wilderness, his only companions the wild animals  and screech-owls inhabiting those solitudes, he arrived at St.  Johnsbury, and met in council with his brethren on the 17th of July.  They held their meetings in a large barn belonging to a Mr. Snow. It  was in this neighborhood that the Snow, Farr, Badger and Bingham  families embraced the Gospel. Apostle Erastus Snow was born at St.  Johnsbury, November 9th, 1818.    With sore and blistered feet, Heber now traveled alone down the  Connecticut river into New Hampshire, visiting the town of Plainfield,  where his mother was born. He met with considerable opposition, even  among his own kindred. At Bradford the Twelve sat in council and tried  Elder Gladden Bishop for teaching false doctrine. He was suspended  from fellowship. Heber next visited Boston, in company with Apostles  Thomas B. Marsh and Brigham Young, and after spending several days  with the Saints in that city, where each was presented with a new suit  of clothes by Sisters Fanny Brewer, Polly Voce and others, they went  northward to the state of Maine. On the way they stopped at Dover, and  were shown through a large cotton factory, the work-hands all  suspending operations and gazing with much curiosity at the \"Mormon  Apostles.\"    The last conference of the year 1835 was held at Farmington, Maine, on  the 28th of August. Having fulfilled their mission, the Apostles  agreed to return to Kirtland, and separated with that understanding,  after appointing a day and hour to meet upon the steamboat wharf in  Buffalo.    At Concord, New Hampshire, under date of September 3rd, Heber writes  thus in his journal: \"Here I understood an Abolitionist named Davis  was going to deliver a lecture at the Court House. I went with the  other stage passengers to hear his principles. After waiting some time  for the gentleman, instead of seeing his person as we anticipated, we  beheld an uproar among the people, and our ears were saluted with the  howls of three or four hundred demons in human shape who were in  search of the Abolitionist; and not finding him in the"]]]
