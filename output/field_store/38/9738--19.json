The  golden redhorse also increased in abundance from 1957 to 1959, but was  most numerous at the upper Neosho station, whereas the other species  occurred mainly at the lower stations.    The mimic shiner, spotted bass, smallmouth, and fan-tailed darter are  characteristic of upstream habitats with clear water (tributaries,  rather than the mainstream), and were taken in the Neosho River only in  1957 or became less abundant from 1957 to 1959.    The silver chub, slender madtom and tadpole madtom were taken in the  Marais des Cygnes River only in 1957 and were not taken in the Neosho  River.    The following species, common to both rivers, were more abundant in the  Neosho: long-nosed gar, short-nosed gar, river carpsucker, creek chub,  sucker-mouthed minnow, red-finned shiner, red shiner, ghost shiner,  blunt-nosed minnow, fat-headed minnow, stoneroller, yellow bullhead,  channel catfish, flathead, stonecat, largemouth, long-eared sunfish,  slender-headed darter, and freshwater drum. These species, collectively,  reflect the more diversified habitats (more gravel-bottom, more  riffle-areas, more gradient, greater range of stream-size sampled) in  the Neosho River.    The following species, common to both rivers, were more abundant in the  Marais des Cygnes: gizzard shad, carp, sand shiner, black bullhead and  white crappie. These species (with the exception of sand shiner)  emphasize the fact that the Marais des Cygnes is a sluggish stream with  large areas of mud bottom. Differences in the abundance of the sand  shiner in the two rivers are part of taxonomic and distributional  studies being conducted by Mr. Bernard C. Nelson.    The following species were not consistently more abundant in one river  than the other: big-mouthed buffalo, black buffalo, small-mouthed  buffalo, short-headed redhorse, green sunfish, orange-spotted sunfish  and orange-throated darter. These species, excepting the orange-throated  darter and short-headed redhorse, occurred in a wide variety of  habitats.          FAUNAL CHANGES, 1957 THROUGH 1959      The following species increased in abundance from 1957 to 1959 (Tables  10 and 11): long-nosed gar, short-nosed gar, river carpsucker, creek  chub, gravel chub, sucker-mouthed minnow, mountain minnow, blunt-nosed  minnow, parrot minnow, stoneroller, stonecat, Neosho madtom, green  sunfish, slender-headed darter, and orange-throated darter.    These species can be separated into three groups, characteristic of  different habitats but having in common a preference for permanent flow.  One group, composed of long-nosed gar, short-nosed gar, river  carpsucker, gravel chub, mountain minnow, parrot minnow, and Neosho  madtom, prefers streams of moderate to large size.    A second group composed of creek chub, sucker-mouthed minnow,  stoneroller, and orange-throated darter occurs most abundantly in small,  permanent streams. The green sunfish may be included here on the basis  of its abundance at the upper Neosho station; however, this is a pioneer  species and does not require permanent flow.    The third group is characteristic of continuously flowing water, but in  both upstream and downstream situations. The species in this group  (blunt-nosed minnow, stonecat, and slender-headed darter), increased in  response to a resumption of permanent flow, but did not respond as  quickly as did channel catfish, flatheads and freshwater drum, which are  discussed subsequently.    The fact that riffle-insects were abundant throughout my study convinces  me that food was not a limiting factor in the re-establishment of the  fish-fauna on riffles of the Neosho River.    The following species decreased in abundance during my study (Tables 10  and 11): gizzard shad, carp, rosy-faced shiner, blunt-faced shiner, red  shiner, mimic shiner, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, channel catfish,  flathead, slender madtom, tadpole madtom, freckled madtom, spotted bass,  largemouth, black crappie, fan-tailed darter, and freshwater drum.    Among the species that decreased, three groups, characteristic of  different habitats, can be distinguished. The first group occurs most  commonly in ponded conditions or in slowly flowing streams. Species in  this group are: shad, carp, black bullhead, tadpole madtom, largemouth,  black crappie, and white crappie. Bullhead, bass and crappie commonly  occur in farm ponds and lakes in Kansas and seem less well adapted to  streams. It is therefore not surprising to find that these species  decreased in abundance when flow was resumed.    A second group, composed of rosy-faced shiner, blunt-faced shiner, mimic  shiner, slender madtom, freckled madtom, spotted bass, and fan-tailed  darter, normally is characteristic of clear tributaries rather than the  mainstream of rivers. These species probably used the mainstream as a  refugium during drought; with the resumption of flow, conditions became  unsuitable for these populations in the mainstream. At the same time,  conditions probably became favorable to the re-establishment of these  species in tributaries. Metcalf (1959:396) listed the rosy-faced shiner,  blunt-faced shiner and mimic shiner as species that were characteristic  of upland tributaries in the Flint Hills and Chautauqua Hills of  Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk counties in Kansas. The slender madtom and  fan-tailed darter are more common in clear streams of southeast Kansas  than in other areas of the state (Cross, personal communication and data  of the State Biological Survey of Kansas). Both species are recorded by  Hall (1952:57-58) only in upland tributaries on the east side of Grand  (Neosho) River in the Fort Gibson Reservoir area of Oklahoma. Neither  species was taken in faunal studies of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma  (Wallen, 1958), in the Verdigris and Fall rivers in Kansas (Schelske,  1957), or by Metcalf (1959).    The spotted bass is not so restricted in its distribution and its  habitat-requirements as are other species in this group; but, in Kansas,  spotted bass are most abundant in clear creeks in the southeast part of  the state.    The freckled madtom was taken in most of the studies cited above and is  most common in the smaller streams of the southeast one-fourth of Kansas  and the northeast one-fourth of Oklahoma. Schelske (1957:47) reports  that the freckled madtom was taken only in March, April, October and  November in the Verdigris River, Kansas. My only record of this species  was obtained in the Neosho River in April, 1958.    The third group is composed of channel catfish, flathead, and freshwater  drum. This group represents that element of the population that  responded most quickly to the resumption of continuous flow. The fact  that adult channel catfish and flatheads live in pools and do not  require flowing water to spawn gives these species a survival advantage  as well as a reproductive advantage over obligatory riffle fishes (such  as most darters) in the highly variable conditions found in Kansas  streams. These factors resulted in unusually high reproductive success  in 1957. Subsequent survival of fry was excellent; however, some  mortality in the highly-dominant 1957 year-class became apparent in the  1958 and 1959 collections, accounting for a numerical decline in these  species. The ability to respond immediately to increased flow is an  adaptive feature that allows these species to maintain high levels of  abundance in the highly fluctuating streams of Kansas.    The continuous flow that occurred in 1957 in the Neosho and Marais des  Cygnes rivers, for the first time in four years, provided the necessary  habitat for survival of young catfish hatched in that year. The nearly  complete absence of other species on the riffles, and the abundant  populations of riffle-insects that I observed in the summer of 1957,  were undoubtedly factors contributing to the survival of young.    The decrease in abundance of the red shiner may be partially due to an  increase in the numbers of other species that are well adapted to  conditions of permanent flow. At the completion of my study, the red  shiner was still the most abundant minnow in both rivers. In 1957 this  species was common in many habitats, including swift riffles, that were  later occupied by madtoms, darters, the gravel chub, mountain minnow and  sucker-mouthed minnow.    The basic pattern of change was clearly an increase in the species that  are characteristic of permanently flowing waters, and a decrease in the  species that are characteristic of ponds or small, clear streams.

And they  remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder  and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge  Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and  immortals.    (ll. 507-543) Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled mad Clymene,  daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him  a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and  clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus  who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he  who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed. But  Menoetius was outrageous, and far-seeing Zeus struck him with a lurid  thunderbolt and sent him down to Erebus because of his mad presumption  and exceeding pride. And Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide  heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of  the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; for this lot wise Zeus  assigned to him. And ready-witted Prometheus he bound with inextricable  bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through his middle, and set on  him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by  night the liver grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird  devoured in the whole day. That bird Heracles, the valiant son of  shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from the  cruel plague, and released him from his affliction--not without the  will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the  Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous  earth. This, then, he regarded, and honoured his famous son; though  he was angry, he ceased from the wrath which he had before because  Prometheus matched himself in wit with the almighty son of Cronos.  For when the gods and mortal men had a dispute at Mecone, even then  Prometheus was forward to cut up a great ox and set portions before  them, trying to befool the mind of Zeus. Before the rest he set flesh  and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox  paunch; but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art  and covered with shining fat. Then the father of men and of gods said to  him:    (ll. 543-544) 'Son of Iapetus, most glorious of all lords, good sir, how  unfairly you have divided the portions!'    (ll. 545-547) So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him.  But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not forgetting his  cunning trick:    (ll. 548-558) 'Zeus, most glorious and greatest of the eternal gods,  take which ever of these portions your heart within you bids.' So he  said, thinking trickery. But Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and  failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief  against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he  took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his  spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out: and because  of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless  gods upon fragrant altars. But Zeus who drives the clouds was greatly  vexed and said to him:    (ll. 559-560) 'Son of Iapetus, clever above all! So, sir, you have not  yet forgotten your cunning arts!'    (ll. 561-584) So spake Zeus in anger, whose wisdom is everlasting; and  from that time he was always mindful of the trick, and would not give  the power of unwearying fire to the Melian [1621] race of mortal men who  live on the earth. But the noble son of Iapetus outwitted him and stole  the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk. And Zeus  who thunders on high was stung in spirit, and his dear heart was angered  when he saw amongst men the far-seen ray of fire. Forthwith he made an  evil thing for men as the price of fire; for the very famous Limping  God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos  willed. And the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with  silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a  broidered veil, a wonder to see; and she, Pallas Athene, put about her  head lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs. Also she put upon her  head a crown of gold which the very famous Limping God made himself and  worked with his own hands as a favour to Zeus his father. On it was much  curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many creatures which the  land and sea rear up, he put most upon it, wonderful things, like living  beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it.    (ll. 585-589) But when he had made the beautiful evil to be the price  for the blessing, he brought her out, delighting in the finery which  the bright-eyed daughter of a mighty father had given her, to the place  where the other gods and men were. And wonder took hold of the deathless  gods and mortal men when they saw that which was sheer guile, not to be  withstood by men.    (ll. 590-612) For from her is the race of women and female kind: of her  is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men  to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful poverty, but only in  wealth. And as in thatched hives bees feed the drones whose nature is to  do mischief--by day and throughout the day until the sun goes down the  bees are busy and lay the white combs, while the drones stay at home  in the covered skeps and reap the toil of others into their own  bellies--even so Zeus who thunders on high made women to be an evil to  mortal men, with a nature to do evil. And he gave them a second evil  to be the price for the good they had: whoever avoids marriage and  the sorrows that women cause, and will not wed, reaches deadly old age  without anyone to tend his years, and though he at least has no lack of  livelihood while he lives, yet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide  his possessions amongst them. And as for the man who chooses the lot  of marriage and takes a good wife suited to his mind, evil continually  contends with good; for whoever happens to have mischievous children,  lives always with unceasing grief in his spirit and heart within him;  and this evil cannot be healed.    (ll. 613-616) So it is not possible to deceive or go beyond the will of  Zeus; for not even the son of Iapetus, kindly Prometheus, escaped his  heavy anger, but of necessity strong bands confined him, although he  knew many a wile.    (ll. 617-643) But when first their father was vexed in his heart with  Obriareus and Cottus and Gyes, he bound them in cruel bonds, because he  was jealous of their exceeding manhood and comeliness and great size:  and he made them live beneath the wide-pathed earth, where they were  afflicted, being set to dwell under the ground, at the end of the earth,  at its great borders, in bitter anguish for a long time and with great  grief at heart. But the son of Cronos and the other deathless gods whom  rich-haired Rhea bare from union with Cronos, brought them up again to  the light at Earth's advising. For she herself recounted all things  to the gods fully, how that with these they would gain victory and a  glorious cause to vaunt themselves. For the Titan gods and as many as  sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with  heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othyrs, but the gods,  givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Cronos, from  Olympus. So they, with bitter wrath, were fighting continually with  one another at that time for ten full years, and the hard strife had  no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly  balanced. But when he had provided those three with all things fitting,  nectar and ambrosia which the gods themselves eat, and when their  proud spirit revived within them all after they had fed on nectar and  delicious ambrosia, then it was that the father of men and gods spoke  amongst them:    (ll. 644-653) 'Hear me, bright children of Earth and Heaven, that I  may say what my heart within me bids. A long while now have we, who are  sprung from Cronos and the Titan gods, fought with each other every  day to get victory and to prevail. But do you show your great might  and unconquerable strength, and face the Titans in bitter strife; for  remember our friendly kindness, and from what sufferings you are come  back to the light from your cruel bondage under misty gloom through our  counsels.'    (ll. 654-663) So he said. And blameless Cottus answered him again:  'Divine one, you speak that which we know well: nay, even of ourselves  we know that your wisdom and understanding is exceeding, and that you  became a defender of the deathless ones from chill doom. And through  your devising we are come back again from the murky gloom and from our  merciless bonds, enjoying what we looked not for, O lord, son of Cronos.  And so now with fixed purpose and deliberate counsel we will aid your  power in dreadful strife and will fight against the Titans in hard  battle.'    (ll. 664-686) So he said: and the gods, givers of good things, applauded  when they heard his word, and their spirit longed for war even more than  before, and they all, both male and female, stirred up hated battle  that day, the Titan gods, and all that were born of Cronos together with  those dread, mighty ones of overwhelming strength whom Zeus brought up  to the light from Erebus beneath the earth. An hundred arms sprang from  the shoulders of all alike, and each had fifty heads growing upon his  shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the Titans in  grim strife, holding huge rocks in their strong hands. And on the other  part the Titans eagerly strengthened their ranks, and both sides at one  time showed the work of their hands and their might. The"]]]
