It then far outshone  Rigel in Orion, and on the 2nd of January following it very nearly  matched Alpha Centauri. From that date it declined; but a second  and even brighter maximum occurred in April, 1843, when Maclear, then  director of the Cape Observatory, saw it blaze out with a splendour  approaching that of Sirius. Its waxings and wanings were marked by  curious \"trepidations\" of brightness extremely perplexing to theory. In  1863 it had sunk below the fifth magnitude, and in 1869 was barely  visible to the naked eye; yet it was not until eighteen years later that  it touched a minimum of 7.6 magnitude. Soon afterwards a recovery of  brightness set in, but was not carried very far; and the star now shines  steadily as of the seventh magnitude, its reddish light contrasting  effectively with the silvery rays of the surrounding nebula. An attempt  to include its fluctuations within a cycle of seventy years[125] has  signally failed; the extent and character of the vicissitudes to which  it is subject stamping it rather as a species of connecting link between  periodic and temporary stars.[126]    Among the numerous topics which engaged Herschel's attention at the Cape  was that of relative stellar brightness. Having contrived an  \"astrometer\" in which an \"artificial star,\" formed by the total  reflection of moonlight from the base of a prism, served as a standard  of comparison, he was able to estimate the lustre of the _natural_ stars  examined by the distances at which the artificial object appeared equal  respectively to each. He thus constructed a table of 191 of the  principal stars,[127] both in the northern and southern hemispheres,  setting forth the numerical values of their apparent brightness  relatively to that of Alpha Centauri, which he selected as a unit  of measurement. Further, the light of the full moon being found by him  to exceed that of his standard star 27,408 times, and Dr. Wollaston  having shown that the light of the full moon is to that of the sun as  1:801,072[128] (Zoellner made the ratio 1:618,000), it became possible to  compare stellar with solar radiance. Hence was derived, in the case of  the few stars at ascertained distances, a knowledge of real lustre.  Alpha Centauri, for example, emits less than twice, Capella one hundred  times as much light as our sun; while Arcturus, at its enormous  distance, must display the splendour of 1,300 such luminaries.    Herschel returned to England in the spring of 1838, bringing with him a  wealth of observation and discovery such as had perhaps never before  been amassed in so short a time. Deserved honours awaited him. He was  created a baronet on the occasion of the Queen's coronation (he had been  knighted in 1831); universities and learned societies vied with each  other in showering distinctions upon him; and the success of an  enterprise in which scientific zeal was tinctured with an attractive  flavour of adventurous romance, was justly regarded as a matter of  national pride. His career as an observing astronomer was now virtually  closed, and he devoted his leisure to the collection and arrangement of  the abundant trophies of his father's and his own activity. The  resulting great catalogue of 5,079 nebulae (including all then certainly  known), published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1864, is, and  will probably long remain, the fundamental source of information on the  subject;[129] but he unfortunately did not live to finish the companion  work on double stars, for which he had accumulated a vast store of  materials.[130] He died at Collingwood in Kent, May 11, 1871, in the  eightieth year of his age, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close  beside the grave of Sir Isaac Newton.    The consideration of Sir John Herschel's Cape observations brings us to  the close of the period we are just now engaged in studying. They were  given to the world, as already stated, three years before the middle of  the century, and accurately represent the condition of sidereal science  at that date. Looking back over the fifty years traversed, we can see at  a glance how great was the stride made in the interval. Not alone was  acquaintance with individual members of the cosmos vastly extended, but  their mutual relations, the laws governing their movements, their  distances from the earth, masses, and intrinsic lustre, had begun to be  successfully investigated. _Begun to be_; for only regarding a scarcely  perceptible minority had even approximate conclusions been arrived at.  Nevertheless the whole progress of the future lay in that beginning; it  was the thin end of the wedge of exact knowledge. The principle of  measurement had been substituted for that of probability; a basis had  been found large and strong enough to enable calculation to ascend from  it to the sidereal heavens; and refinements had been introduced,  fruitful in performance, but still more in promise. Thus, rather the  kind than the amount of information collected was significant for the  time to come--rather the methods employed than the results actually  secured rendered the first half of the nineteenth century of epochal  importance in the history of our knowledge of the stars.

[Illustration: M. Raymond Poincare, President of France.]    The courage which every Continental army has exhibited has forever  destroyed the idea that universal service weakens the valor of an  army. Millionaire and peasant, nobleman and workman fighting side by  side in the ranks, and doing all the drudgery of the trenches in  common, develop a democracy which means that a man appreciates his  fellow man for his own sake.    The old idea that wars must be frequent in order to keep up a  nation's virility has also been disproved. Universal service both in  France and Germany through forty years of peace, had been an  important influence in the better physical development of the race,  which led to the fortitude, precision, and courage exhibited. At the  same time, a realization of the seriousness of war on the part of  all men, because they knew before this war began the punishing  effect of rifle or machine-gun and artillery fire, is a powerful  deterrent to making war in any spasm of emotion.    There is no more glory, there is no more sport to war. It has become  scientific, businesslike, and commonplace. Never has an unprepared  nation been so helpless against the prepared as to-day. The American  Revolution could never have been won by untrained levies to-day  against the British regulars if they possessed modern weapons. Our  forefathers had their fowling pieces, taken from the walls in the  days when the cannon fired a solid shot for a few hundred yards, and  there were few cannon; and so far as weapons were concerned, they  were almost on a level with their enemy, the enemy's only  superiority being that of their drill and organization. Now the  enemy would have guns and rifles which it takes many months to make,  even if you have the plants.    In an era of sanitation and bodily cleanliness and popular education,  it has been shown that far from men having lost their virility, they  fought far better than the so-called \"strong\" and primitive man, and  those soldiers of former ages who \"drank hard six days a week and  fought like the devil on Sunday\" and would look down upon this age as  effeminate. Physically, mentally, and morally, the soldiers who sprang  to arms in the beginning of this war were superior unquestionably to  any soldiers who have ever gone into any war in Europe. They had more  skill, more courage, more determination. Their pride was greater, and  that alone made them more gallant. Those who wanted to know what war  was like, to have the experience of their first baptism of fire, soon  had it in the swift processes of mobilization and attack. Then, in  their stubbornness, they settled down to the long, grim business of  seeing through a task that was begun. The trenches were the last  places where you would hear the advocacy of war as war. There the  sentiment was simply of duty that must go on until a decision was  reached.    Never has war been more savagely fought, possibly because the modern  mind reasons that war being force and violence and killing, this  principle should be applied to the limit. Yet never have the wounded  been so tenderly cared for, never has the hospital organization been  so complete. Never probably in the history of European warfare have  prisoners, once they were taken, been so well treated. In other wars  100,000 survivors or so returned home when the struggle was over.  Here millions will go. Every home will either have its dead hero or  its living veteran. These are the men who will rule Europe in the  future. Behind the lines, among the civilian population, the war has  acted as a scourge. It has submerged self into the whole. Fatty  degeneration of the heart of the body politic has been cut away to  the muscle.          THE THEATRES OF THE WAR'S CAMPAIGNS    By F. H. SIMONDS    MAIN MILITARY FEATURES      The purpose of this review is to summarize briefly the main military  phases of the first year and a half of the Great War. To do this it  is perhaps simplest to accept the unity supplied by the three major  campaigns of the Central Powers, that of Germany against France,  that of Austria and Germany against Russia, and that of Germany,  Austria, and Bulgaria against Serbia.    There is no intention of discussing here any ethical or political  considerations. Certain historical details are, however, of real  interest and value. Thus it is worth while to recall that the  present conflict differs little, if at all, from the earlier  coalition wars of Europe, in which one nation, numerically weaker,  has sought to impose its will upon a group of nations collectively  larger, richer, and potentially capable of employing greater numbers  of men. In a word, the present war is a pretty accurate repetition  of the wars of Louis XIV and Napoleon I, with Germany playing the  French role.    Now in such struggles it had always been true, and German writers,  notably Bernhardi, insisted it would be true of any future war, that  the single chance for a decisive victory for the smaller nation lay  in crushing the several foes before they were able to get their  collective strength in the field, while the superior preparedness,  training, general military efficiency of the smaller nation still  enabled it to put the superior numbers at the decisive point at the  crucial moment.    This whole conception is made perfectly clear by a glance at the  familiar and classic parallel of the Napoleonic wars. In 1805  Napoleon, facing a European coalition, which included Russia, Great  Britain, and Austria, and was bound to enlist Prussia ultimately,  quite as the present anti-German group enlisted Italy, had to solve  the same military problem.    Consider what he did. Breaking his camp at Boulogne, which he left  in September, 1805, he sent his Grand Army into southern Germany and  against Ulm. On October 20 he captured Mack's army at Ulm. On  December 2 he routed the Austrian and Russian armies at Austerlitz,  and on December 26 there was signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which  eliminated Austria from the war. Prussia now intervening, he  destroyed the Prussian armies at Jena and Auerstaedt on October 14,  1806. In June, 1807, he completed his task by defeating the Russians  at Friedland. The Peace of Tilsit, which followed immediately,  removed Russia and Prussia from the fighting line, as Austria had  already been removed. Between the capitulation of Ulm and the  victory of Friedland there intervened nineteen months. More than  eighteen have now passed since the fall of Liege in the present war.    The Peace of Tilsit made Napoleon the master of Europe with only  Great Britain left in the field against him. The subsequent military  and political history which led to Napoleon's downfall has no  pertinence in the present discussion. What it is essential to  recognize is that the German high command in August, 1914,  approached a Napoleonic problem in the Napoleonic fashion.    In German quarters there had been before the war, and there has been  since, a debate as to the comparative advantage of making the first  campaign against France or against Russia. The fact that the attack  on France failed has doubtless contributed to strengthen the case of  those who held the view of the elder Moltke and advocated an eastern  offensive. But this is merely an academic discussion. What is of  interest to us now is to recognize that Germany did decide to attack  France, that she did direct against the republic the first and  necessarily the greatest blow she could deliver. It was not until  April, 1915, that she actually undertook an attack upon Russia, and  then the prospect of a decisive victory, on the Napoleonic order,  had practically disappeared.      THE ATTACK UPON FRANCE    Turning now to the first campaign, the attack upon France, it is to  be recognized at the outset that the German purpose was to dispose  of France in the military sense for the period of the war by a  campaign that should repeat the success of 1870. It was essential  that this victory should be achieved before France could profit by  Russian activity in the east and before Great Britain could render  material military assistance to her French ally. It was equally  essential that the blow should be so swift and heavy that it would  crush the French before they could equip and organize their great  reserves, for whom, thanks to legislative folly and pacifist  agitation, there was lacking equipment and arms.    For the accomplishment of this great task, Germany counted upon her  superior numbers, the greater speed of her mobilization, and the  excess of her population over France to give her a decisive  advantage. She counted also upon her advantage in heavy artillery  and machine guns, on her organization of motor transport, which was  to establish new records in invasion. Only in field artillery, in  the now famous \"seventy-fives,\" could France claim any advantage.    In 1870 Sedan had come four weeks after the first German troops had  entered France. For the new campaign the Germans allowed six weeks.  For this time German high command reckoned that Russia could be  mobilized in the east, and that any incidental Russian success in  East Prussia or Silesia would be counterbalanced by the tremendous  victories to be won in northern France. Paris itself would be a  sufficient counterprize for Posen, Breslau, or Cracow.    The time limit, however, imposed certain other conditions. The  Franco-German frontier from Luxemburg to Switzerland had been  transformed into one long barrier, garnished with detached forts  and resting upon the first-class fortresses of Verdun, Toul, Epinal,  and Belfort. To pierce such a barrier was not impossible but to  break through in three weeks, with the whole French army before the  forts and the shortness of the front offering the Germans no  opportunity to take advantage of their superior numbers, was  recognized as next "]]]
