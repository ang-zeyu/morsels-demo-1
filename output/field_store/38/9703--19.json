Motteville, of Paris, but you did not know that the  chief of my personal property was invested in his hands. I had great  confidence in him, and I am yet willing to believe, that he is not  wholly unworthy of my esteem. A variety of circumstances have concurred  to ruin him, and--I am ruined with him.'    St. Aubert paused to conceal his emotion.    'The letters I have just received from M. Quesnel,' resumed he,  struggling to speak with firmness, 'enclosed others from Motteville,  which confirmed all I dreaded.'    'Must we then quit La Vallee?' said Emily, after a long pause of  silence. 'That is yet uncertain,' replied St. Aubert, 'it will depend  upon the compromise Motteville is able to make with his creditors. My  income, you know, was never large, and now it will be reduced to  little indeed! It is for you, Emily, for you, my child, that I am most  afflicted.' His last words faltered; Emily smiled tenderly upon him  through her tears, and then, endeavouring to overcome her emotion, 'My  dear father,' said she, 'do not grieve for me, or for yourself; we may  yet be happy;--if La Vallee remains for us, we must be happy. We will  retain only one servant, and you shall scarcely perceive the change in  your income. Be comforted, my dear sir; we shall not feel the want of  those luxuries, which others value so highly, since we never had a taste  for them; and poverty cannot deprive us of many consolations. It cannot  rob us of the affection we have for each other, or degrade us in our own  opinion, or in that of any person, whose opinion we ought to value.'    St. Aubert concealed his face with his handkerchief, and was unable  to speak; but Emily continued to urge to her father the truths, which  himself had impressed upon her mind.    'Besides, my dear sir, poverty cannot deprive us of intellectual  delights. It cannot deprive you of the comfort of affording me examples  of fortitude and benevolence; nor me of the delight of consoling a  beloved parent. It cannot deaden our taste for the grand, and the  beautiful, or deny us the means of indulging it; for the scenes  of nature--those sublime spectacles, so infinitely superior to all  artificial luxuries! are open for the enjoyment of the poor, as well as  of the rich. Of what, then, have we to complain, so long as we are not  in want of necessaries? Pleasures, such as wealth cannot buy, will still  be ours. We retain, then, the sublime luxuries of nature, and lose only  the frivolous ones of art.'    St. Aubert could not reply: he caught Emily to his bosom, their tears  flowed together, but--they were not tears of sorrow. After this language  of the heart, all other would have been feeble, and they remained silent  for some time. Then, St. Aubert conversed as before; for, if his mind  had not recovered its natural tranquillity, it at least assumed the  appearance of it.    They reached the romantic town of Leucate early in the day, but St.  Aubert was weary, and they determined to pass the night there. In the  evening, he exerted himself so far as to walk with his daughter to view  the environs that overlook the lake of Leucate, the Mediterranean, part  of Rousillon, with the Pyrenees, and a wide extent of the luxuriant  province of Languedoc, now blushing with the ripened vintage, which the  peasants were beginning to gather. St. Aubert and Emily saw the busy  groups, caught the joyous song, that was wafted on the breeze, and  anticipated, with apparent pleasure, their next day's journey over this  gay region. He designed, however, still to wind along the sea-shore.  To return home immediately was partly his wish, but from this he was  withheld by a desire to lengthen the pleasure, which the journey gave  his daughter, and to try the effect of the sea air on his own disorder.    On the following day, therefore, they recommenced their journey through  Languedoc, winding the shores of the Mediterranean; the Pyrenees still  forming the magnificent back-ground of their prospects, while on their  right was the ocean, and, on their left, wide extended plains melting  into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was pleased, and conversed much with  Emily, yet his cheerfulness was sometimes artificial, and sometimes a  shade of melancholy would steal upon his countenance, and betray him.  This was soon chased away by Emily's smile; who smiled, however, with an  aching heart, for she saw that his misfortunes preyed upon his mind, and  upon his enfeebled frame.    It was evening when they reached a small village of Upper Languedoc,  where they meant to pass the night, but the place could not afford  them beds; for here, too, it was the time of the vintage, and they  were obliged to proceed to the next post. The languor of illness and of  fatigue, which returned upon St. Aubert, required immediate repose,  and the evening was now far advanced; but from necessity there was no  appeal, and he ordered Michael to proceed.    The rich plains of Languedoc, which exhibited all the glories of the  vintage, with the gaieties of a French festival, no longer awakened St.  Aubert to pleasure, whose condition formed a mournful contrast to the  hilarity and youthful beauty which surrounded him. As his languid eyes  moved over the scene, he considered, that they would soon, perhaps, be  closed for ever on this world. 'Those distant and sublime mountains,'  said he secretly, as he gazed on a chain of the Pyrenees that stretched  towards the west, 'these luxuriant plains, this blue vault, the cheerful  light of day, will be shut from my eyes! The song of the peasant, the  cheering voice of man--will no longer sound for me!'    The intelligent eyes of Emily seemed to read what passed in the mind of  her father, and she fixed them on his face, with an expression of such  tender pity, as recalled his thoughts from every desultory object of  regret, and he remembered only, that he must leave his daughter without  protection. This reflection changed regret to agony; he sighed deeply,  and remained silent, while she seemed to understand that sigh, for  she pressed his hand affectionately, and then turned to the window to  conceal her tears. The sun now threw a last yellow gleam on the waves of  the Mediterranean, and the gloom of twilight spread fast over the scene,  till only a melancholy ray appeared on the western horizon, marking the  point where the sun had set amid the vapours of an autumnal evening. A  cool breeze now came from the shore, and Emily let down the glass; but  the air, which was refreshing to health, was as chilling to sickness,  and St. Aubert desired, that the window might be drawn up. Increasing  illness made him now more anxious than ever to finish the day's journey,  and he stopped the muleteer to enquire how far they had yet to go to the  next post. He replied, 'Nine miles.' 'I feel I am unable to proceed much  further,' said St. Aubert; 'enquire, as you go, if there is any house on  the road that would accommodate us for the night.' He sunk back in  the carriage, and Michael, cracking his whip in the air, set off, and  continued on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almost fainting, called  to him to stop. Emily looked anxiously from the window, and saw a  peasant walking at some little distance on the road, for whom they  waited, till he came up, when he was asked, if there was any house in  the neighbourhood that accommodated travellers. He replied, that he knew  of none. 'There is a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right,'  added he, 'but I believe it receives nobody, and I cannot show you the  way, for I am almost a stranger here.' St. Aubert was going to ask  him some further question concerning the chateau, but the man abruptly  passed on. After some consideration, he ordered Michael to proceed  slowly to the woods. Every moment now deepened the twilight, and  increased the difficulty of finding the road. Another peasant soon after  passed. 'Which is the way to the chateau in the woods?' cried Michael.    'The chateau in the woods!' exclaimed the peasant--'Do you mean that  with the turret, yonder?'    'I don't know as for the turret, as you call it,' said Michael, 'I mean  that white piece of a building, that we see at a distance there, among  the trees.'    'Yes, that is the turret; why, who are you, that you are going thither?'  said the man with surprise.    St. Aubert, on hearing this odd question, and observing the peculiar  tone in which it was delivered, looked out from the carriage. 'We are  travellers,' said he, 'who are in search of a house of accommodation for  the night; is there any hereabout?'    'None, Monsieur, unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder,'  replied the peasant, pointing to the woods, 'but I would not advise you  to go there.'    'To whom does the chateau belong?'    'I scarcely know myself, Monsieur.'    'It is uninhabited, then?' 'No, not uninhabited; the steward and  housekeeper are there, I believe.'    On hearing this, St. Aubert determined to proceed to the chateau, and  risque the refusal of being accommodated for the night; he therefore  desired the countryman would shew Michael the way, and bade him expect  reward for his trouble. The man was for a moment silent, and then said,  that he was going on other business, but that the road could not be  missed, if they went up an avenue to the right, to which he pointed. St.  Aubert was going to speak, but the peasant wished him good night, and  walked on.    The carriage now moved towards the avenue, which was guarded by a gate,  and Michael having dismounted to open it, they entered between rows of  ancient oak and chesnut, whose intermingled branches formed a lofty arch  above. There was something so gloomy and desolate in the appearance of  this avenue, and its lonely silence, that Emily almost shuddered as  she passed along; and, recollecting the manner in which the peasant had  mentioned the chateau, she gave a mysterious meaning to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#16)"],[1,"planted?\"    \"Never, I'm afraid,\" he said glumly, and she stared. \"So I'll have to  start slugging with at least one foot in the air.\"    That startled her. \"Explain, please?\"    \"I wanted _proof_. Stuff that I could take to the District--that I could  use to tack some hides out flat on a barn door with. Do I get it? I do  not. Not a shred. Neither can you. What chance do you think there is of  ever getting any real proof?\"    \"Very little,\" Celeste admitted. \"But you can at least smash Pettler,  Wilson, and that crowd. _How_ I hate those slimy snakes! I wish that you  could smash Tom Keller, the poisonous moron!\"    \"Not so much moron--although he acts like one at times--as an ignorant  puppet with a head swelled three sizes too big for his hat. But you can  quit yapping about slugging--fireworks are due to start at two o'clock  tomorrow afternoon, when Drake is going to reject tonight's run of  shell.\"    \"Really? But I don't see how either Pettler or Wilson come in.\"    \"They don't. A fight with those small fry--even smashing them--wouldn't  make enough noise. Keller.\"    \"Keller!\" Celeste squealed. \"But you'll....\"    \"I know I'll get fired. So what? By tackling him I can raise enough hell  so that the Big Shots will have to cut out at least some of the rough  stuff. You'll probably get fired too, you know--you've been too close to  me for your own good.\"    \"Not me.\" She shook her head vigorously. \"The minute they terminate you,  I quit. Poof! Who cares? Besides, I can get a better job in Townville.\"    \"Without leaving the Project. That's what I figured. It's the boys I'm  worried about. I've been getting them ready for this for weeks.\"    \"But they will quit, too. Your Siberians--your Inspectors--of a surety  they will quit, every one!\"    \"They won't release them; and what Stoner and Black will do to them,  even after the war, if they quit without releases, shouldn't be done to  a dog. They won't quit, either--at least if they don't try to push them  around too much. Keller's mouth is watering to get hold of Siberia, but  he'll never make it, nor any one of his stooges.... I'd better dictate a  memorandum to Black on that now, while I'm calm and collected; telling  him what he'll have to do to keep my boys from tearing Entwhistle  apart.\"    \"But do you think he will pay any attention to it?\"    \"I'll say he will!\" Kinnison snorted. \"Don't kid yourself about Black,  Celeste. He's a smart man, and before this is done he'll know that he'll  have to keep his nose clean.\"    \"But you--how can you do it?\" Celeste marveled. \"Me, I would urge them  on. Few would have the patriotism....\"    \"Patriotism, hell! If that were all, I would have stirred up a  revolution long ago. It's for the boys, in years to come. They've got to  keep _their_ noses clean, too. Get your notebook, please, and take this  down. Rough draft--I'm going to polish it up until it has teeth and  claws in every line.\"    And that evening, after supper, he informed Eunice of all the new  developments.    \"Is it still O.K. with you,\" he concluded, \"for me to get myself fired  off of this high-salaried job of mine?\"    \"Certainly. Being you, how can you do anything else? Oh, how I wish I  could wring their necks!\" That conversation went on and on, but  additional details are not necessary here.    Shortly after two o'clock of the following afternoon, Celeste took a  call; and listened shamelessly.    \"Kinnison speaking.\"    \"Tug, Uncle Ralph. The casts sectioned just like we thought they would.  Dead ringers for Plate D. So Drake hung a red ticket on every tray.  Piddy was right there, waiting, and started to raise hell. So I chipped  in, and he beat it so fast that I looked to see his coat-tail catch  fire. Drake didn't quite like to call you, so I did. If Piddy keeps on  going at the rate he left here, he'll be in Keller's office in nothing  flat.\"    \"O.K., Tug. Tell Drake that the shell he rejected are going to stay  rejected, and to come in right now with his report. Would you like to  come along?\"    \"_Would_ I!\" Tugwell hung up and:    \"But do you want _him_ here, Doc?\" Celeste asked, anxiously, without  considering whether or not her boss would approve of her eavesdropping.    \"I certainly do. If I can keep Tug from blowing his top, the rest of the  boys will stay in line.\"    A few minutes later Tugwell strode in, bringing with him Drake, the  Chief Line Inspector of the Nine Line. Shortly thereafter the office  door was wrenched open. Keller had come to Kinnison, accompanied by the  Superintendent whom the Siberians referred to, somewhat contemptuously,  as \"Piddy.\"    \"Damn your soul, Kinnison, come out here--I want to talk to you!\" Keller  roared, and doors snapped open up and down the long corridor.    \"Shut up, you God damned louse!\" This from Tugwell, who, black eyes  almost emitting sparks, was striding purposefully forward. \"I'll sock  you so damned hard that....\"    \"Pipe down, Tug, I'll handle this.\" Kinnison's voice was not loud, but  it had then a peculiarly carrying and immensely authoritative quality.  \"Verbally or physically; however he wants to have it.\"    He turned to Keller, who had jumped backward into the hall to avoid the  young Siberian.    \"As for you, Keller, if you had the brains that God gave bastard geese  in Ireland, you would have had this conference in private. Since you  started it in public, however, I'll finish it in public. How you came to  pick _me_ for a yes-man I'll never know--just one more measure of your  stupidity, I suppose.\"    \"Those shell are perfect!\" Keller shouted. \"Tell Drake here to pass  them, right now. If you don't, by God I'll....\"    \"Shut up!\" Kinnison's voice cut. \"I'll do the talking--you listen. The  spec says quote shall be free from objectionable cavitation unquote. The  Line Inspectors, who know their stuff, say that those cavitations are  objectionable. So do the Chemical Engineers. Therefore, as far as I am  concerned, they are objectionable. Those shell are rejected, and they  will _stay_ rejected.\"    \"That's what _you_ think,\" Keller raged. \"But there'll be a new Head of  Inspection, who will pass them, tomorrow morning!\"    \"In that you may be half right. When you get done licking Black's boots,  tell him that I am in my office.\"    Kinnison re-entered his suite. Keller, swearing, strode away with Piddy.  Doors clicked shut.    \"I _am_ going to quit, Uncle Ralph, law or no law!\" Tugwell stormed.  \"They'll run that bunch of crap through, and then....\"    \"Will you promise not to quit until they do?\" Kinnison asked, quietly.    \"Huh?\" \"What?\" Tugwell's eyes--and Celeste's--were pools of  astonishment. Celeste, being on the inside, understood first.    \"Oh--to keep his nose clean--I see!\" she exclaimed.    \"Exactly. Those shell will not be accepted, nor any like them. On the  surface, we got licked. I will get fired. You will find, however, that  we won this particular battle. And if you boys stay here and hang  together and keep on slugging you can win a lot more.\"    \"Maybe, if we raise enough hell, we can make them fire us, too?\" Drake  suggested.    \"I doubt it. But unless I'm wrong, you can just about write your own  ticket from now on, if you play it straight.\" Kinnison grinned to  himself, at something which the young people could not see.    \"You told me what Stoner and Black would do to us,\" Tugwell said,  intensely. \"What I'm afraid of is that they'll do it to you.\"    \"They can't. Not a chance in the world,\" Kinnison assured him. \"You  fellows are young--not established. But I'm well-enough known in my own  field so that if they tried to black-ball me they'd just get themselves  laughed at, and they know it. So beat it back to the Nine, you kids, and  hang red tickets on everything that doesn't cross-section up to  standard. Tell the gang goodbye for me--I'll keep you posted.\"    In less than an hour Kinnison was called into the Office of the  President. He was completely at ease; Black was not.    \"It has been decided to ... uh ... ask for your resignation,\" the  President announced at last.    \"Save your breath,\" Kinnison advised. \"I came down here to do a job, and  the only way you can keep me from doing that job is to fire me.\"    \"That was not ... uh ... entirely unexpected. A difficulty arose,  however, in deciding what reason to put on your termination papers.\"    \"I can well believe that. You can put down anything you like,\" Kinnison  shrugged, \"with one exception. Any implication of incompetence and  you'll have to prove it in court.\"    \"Incompatibility, say?\"    \"O.K.\"    \"Miss Briggs--'Incompatibility with the highest echelon of Stoner and  Black, Inc.,' please. You may as well wait, Dr. Kinnison; it will take  only a moment.\"    \"Fine. I've got a couple of things to say. First, I know as well as you  do that you're between Scylla and Charybdis--damned if you do and damned  if you don't.\"    \"Certainly not! Ridiculous!\" Black blustered, but his eyes wavered.  \"Where did you get such a preposterous idea? What do you mean?\"    \"If you ram those sub-standard H.E.A.T. shell through, you are going to  have some more prematures. Not many--the stuff is actually almost good  enough--one in ten thousand, say: perhaps one in fifty thousand. But you  know damned well that you can't afford _any_. What my Siberians and  Inspectors know about you and Keller and Piddy and the Nine Line would  be enough; but to cap the climax that brainless jackal of yours let the  cat completely out of the bag this afternoon, and everybody in Building  One was listening. One more premature would blow Entwhistle wide  open--would start something that not all the politicians in Washington  could stop. On the other hand, if you scrap those lots and go back to  pouring good loads, your Mr. Stoner, of New York and Washington, will be  very unhappy and will scream bloody murder. I'm sure, however, that you  won't offer any Plate D loads to Ordnance--in view of the temper of my  boys"]]]
