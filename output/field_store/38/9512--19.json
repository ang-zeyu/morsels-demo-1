According to the custom and conscience of the time, the insolvent young  merchant was under no obligation whatever to pay liabilities contracted  by the other men, but Lincoln could never be induced even to compromise  any of the accounts the others had gone off and left him to settle.  \"Honest Abe\" paid the last cent of his \"national debt\" nearly twenty  years later, after much toil, self-denial and hardship.      POSTMASTER LINCOLN AND JACK ARMSTRONG'S FAMILY    Again out of employment, Abe was forced to accept the hospitality of his  friends of whom he now had a large number. While in business with Berry  he received the appointment as postmaster. The pay of the New Salem post  office was not large, but Lincoln, always longing for news and  knowledge, had the privilege of reading the newspapers which passed  through his hands. He took so much pains in delivering the letters and  papers that came into his charge as postmaster that he anticipated the  \"special delivery\" and \"rural free delivery\" features of the postal  service of the present day.      \"A. LINCOLN, DEPUTY SURVEYOR\"    Later John Calhoun, the county surveyor, sent word to Lincoln that he  would appoint him deputy surveyor of the county if he would accept the  position. The young man, greatly astonished, went to Springfield to call  on Calhoun and see if the story could be true. Calhoun knew that Lincoln  was utterly ignorant of surveying, but told him he might take time to  study up. As soon as Lincoln was assured that the appointment did not  involve any political obligation--for Calhoun was a Jackson Democrat,  and Lincoln was already a staunch Whig--he procured a copy of Flint and  Gibson's \"Surveying\" and went to work with a will. With the aid of  Mentor Graham, and studying day and night, he mastered the subject and  reported to Calhoun in six weeks. The county surveyor was astounded, but  when Lincoln gave ample proofs of his ability to do field work, the  chief surveyor appointed him a deputy and assigned him to the northern  part of Sangamon County.    Deputy Surveyor Lincoln had to run deeper in debt for a horse and  surveying instruments in order to do this new work. Although he made  three dollars a day at it--a large salary for that time--and board and  expenses were cheap, he was unable to make money fast enough to satisfy  one creditor who was pushing him to pay one of the old debts left by the  failure of Berry & Lincoln. This man sued Lincoln and, getting judgment,  seized the deputy's horse and instruments. This was like \"killing the  goose that laid the golden egg.\" Lincoln was in despair. But a friend,  as a surprise, bought in the horse and instruments for one hundred and  twenty dollars and presented them to the struggling surveyor.    President Lincoln, many years afterward, generously repaid this man,  \"Uncle Jimmy\" Short, for his friendly act in that hour of need.    Lincoln's reputation as a story teller and wrestler had spread so that  when it became known that he was to survey a tract in a certain district  the whole neighborhood turned out and held a sort of picnic. Men and  boys stood ready to \"carry chain,\" drive stakes, blaze trees, or work  for the popular deputy in any capacity--just to hear his funny stories  and odd jokes. They had foot races, wrestling matches and other  athletic sports, in which the surveyor sometimes took part.    But Lincoln's honesty was as manifest in \"running his lines\" as in his  weights and measures while he was a clerk and storekeeper. In whatever  he attempted he did his best. He had that true genius, which is defined  as \"the ability to take pains.\" With all his jokes and fun Abraham  Lincoln was deeply in earnest. Careless work in making surveys involved  the landholders of that part of the country in endless disputes and  going to law about boundaries. But Lincoln's surveys were recognized as  correct always, so that, although he had mastered the science in six  weeks, lawyers and courts had such confidence in his skill, as well as  his honesty, that his record as to a certain corner or line was accepted  as the true verdict and that ended the dispute.      ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE    Hampered though he was by unjust debts and unreasonable creditors,  Postmaster and Surveyor Lincoln gained an honorable reputation  throughout the county, so that when he ran for the State Legislature,  in 1834, he was elected by a creditable majority.          CHAPTER XIII    THE YOUNG LEGISLATOR IN LOVE      SMOOT'S RESPONSIBILITY    Paying his debts had kept Lincoln so poor that, though he had been  elected to the Legislature, he was not properly clothed or equipped to  make himself presentable as the people's representative at the State  capital, then located at Vandalia. One day he went with a friend to call  on an older acquaintance, named Smoot, who was almost as dry a joker as  himself, but Smoot had more of this world's goods than the young  legislator-elect. Lincoln began at once to chaff his friend.    \"Smoot,\" said he, \"did you vote for me?\"    \"I did that very thing,\" answered Smoot.    \"Well,\" said Lincoln with a wink, \"that makes you responsible. You must  lend me the money to buy suitable clothing, for I want to make a decent  appearance in the Legislature.\"    \"How much do you want?\" asked Smoot.    \"About two hundred dollars, I reckon.\"    For friendship's sake and for the honor of Sangamon County the young  representative received the money at once.      ANN RUTLEDGE--\"LOVED AND LOST\"    Abe Lincoln's new suit of clothes made him look still more handsome in  the eyes of Ann, the daughter of the proprietor of Rutledge's Tavern,  where Abe was boarding at that time. She was a beautiful girl who had  been betrothed to a young man named McNamar, who was said to have  returned to New York State to care for his dying father and look after  the family estate. It began to leak out that this young man was going  about under an assumed name and certain suspicious circumstances came to  light. But Ann, though she loved the young legislator, still clung to  her promise and the man who had proved false to her. As time went on,  though she was supposed to be betrothed to Mr. Lincoln, the treatment  she had received from the recreant lover preyed upon her mind so that  she fell into a decline in the summer of 1835, about a year after her  true lover's election to the Legislature.    William O. Stoddard, one of the President's private secretaries, has  best told the story of the young lover's despair over the loss of his  first love:    \"It is not known precisely when Ann Rutledge told her suitor that her  heart was his, but early in 1835 it was publicly known that they were  solemnly betrothed. Even then the scrupulous maiden waited for the  return of the absent McNamar, that she might be formally released from  the obligation to him which he had so recklessly forfeited. Her friends  argued with her that she was carrying her scruples too far, and at last,  as neither man nor letter came, she permitted it to be understood that  she would marry Abraham Lincoln as soon as his legal studies should be  completed.    \"That was a glorious summer for him; the brightest, sweetest, most  hopeful he yet had known. It was also the fairest time he was ever to  see; for even now, as the golden days came and went, they brought an  increasing shadow on their wings. It was a shadow that was not to pass  away. Little by little came indications that the health of Ann Rutledge  had suffered under the prolonged strain to which she had been subjected.  Her sensitive nature had been strung to too high a tension and the  chords of her life were beginning to give way.    \"There were those of her friends who said that she died of a broken  heart, but the doctors called it 'brain fever.'    \"On the 25th of August, 1835, just before the summer died, she passed  away from earth. But she never faded from the heart of Abraham  Lincoln. . . . In her early grave was buried the best hope he ever knew,  and the shadow of that great darkness was never entirely lifted from  him.    \"A few days before Ann's death a message from her brought her betrothed  to her bedside, and they were left alone. No one ever knew what passed  between them in the endless moments of that last sad farewell; but  Lincoln left the house with inexpressible agony written upon his face.  He had been to that hour a man of marvelous poise and self-control, but  the pain he now struggled with grew deeper and more deep, until, when  they came and told him she was dead, his heart and will, and even his  brain itself gave way. He was utterly without help or the knowledge of  possible help in this world or beyond it. He was frantic for a time,  seeming even to lose the sense of his own identity, and all New Salem  said that he was insane. He piteously moaned and raved:    \"'I never can be reconciled to have the snow, rain, and storms beat upon  her grave.'    \"His best friends seemed to have lost their influence over him, . . . all  but one; for Bowling Green . . . managed to entice the poor fellow to his  own home, a short distance from the village, there to keep watch and  ward over him until the fury of his sorrow should wear away. There were  well-grounded fears lest he might do himself some injury, and the watch  was vigilantly kept.    \"In a few weeks reason again obtained the mastery, and it was safe to  let him return to his studies and his work. He could indeed work again,  and he could once more study law, for there was a kind of relief in  steady occupation and absorbing toil, but he was not, could not ever be  the same man. . . .    \"Lincoln had been fond of poetry from boyhood, and had gradually made  himself familiar with large parts of Shakespeare's plays and the works  of other great writers. He now discovered, in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#16)"],[1," of Scripture. Then there were individual  prayers by one and another of the congregation, and then some more  singing. The only hymn I could find in the book that I knew was the fine  old hymn, \"How Firm a Foundation,\" and that was sung heartily to the  \"Adeste Fideles.\" They are naturally a musical race, picking up airs  with great facility, and they thoroughly enjoy singing.    [Sidenote: THE \"DOUBLE STANDARD\"]    After the service the missionary confided some of his troubles to me. He  had lately learned through his interpreter that the burden of most of  the individual prayers was that the supplicator might \"catch plenty  skins\" and be more successful in hunting than his fellows; and though he  had done his best to impress upon them the superior importance of making  request for spiritual benefit, he was afraid they had made no change.  \"Our people 'outside,'\" he said, \"don't understand these folk, and I'm  not sure that I thoroughly understand them myself.\" \"They're all  'converted,'\" he said; \"they all claim to have experienced a change of  heart, but some of them I know are not living like converted people, and  sometimes I have my doubts about most of them.\" My sympathy went out to  him in his loneliness and his earnestness and his disappointments. I  pointed out that the emotional response to emotional preaching was  comparatively easy to get from any primitive people, but that to change  their whole lives, to uproot old customs of sensual indulgence, to  engraft new ideas of virtue and chastity was a long, slow process  anywhere in the world. It was chiefly in the matter of sexual morality  that his doubts and difficulties lay, and I was able to assure him that  his experience was but the common experience of all those who had  laboured for the uplifting of savage people. Indeed, how should it be  otherwise? Until quite lately there was almost promiscuous use of women.  A man receiving a traveller in his dwelling overnight proffered his wife  as a part of his hospitality; the temporary interchange of wives was  common; young men and young women gratified themselves without rebuke;  children were valuable however come by, and there was no special  distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring. As one  reflects on these conditions and then looks back upon conditions amongst  white people, it would seem that all the civilised races have done is to  set up a double standard of sexual morality as against the single  standard of the savage. It can hardly be claimed that the average white  man is continent, or even much more continent than the average Esquimau,  but he has forced continence upon the greater part of his women,  reserving a dishonoured remnant for his own irresponsible use. And there  are signs that some of those who nowadays inveigh against the white  man's double standard are in reality desirous of substituting, not the  single standard of the Christian ideal, but the single standard of the  savage. In the mining camps the prostitute has a sort of  half-way-recognised social position, and in polite parlance is referred  to as a \"sporting lady\"--surely the most horribly incongruous phrase  ever coined; she often marries a miner who will tell you that she is as  good as he is, and she is received afterwards by all but a few as a  \"respectable married woman.\"    There had been some trouble of this sort at this mission. The great  northern gold seekers' wave of '97 and '98 threw a numerous band of  prospectors up the Kobuk as well as up the Koyukuk. The wave had receded  and left on the Kobuk but one little pool behind it, a handful of men  who found something better than \"pay\" on the Shungnak, a few miles away.  And there was much criticism of the missionary's methods amongst them.  Word of the arrival of strangers had brought some of them to Long Beach,  and on Sunday night I had opportunity of addressing them, with a view to  enlisting their sympathy, if possible. What if mistakes were made, what  if some of the methods employed were open to question? Here was a man  who beyond doubt was earnestly labouring in the best way he knew for the  improvement of these natives. Such an effort demanded the co-operation  of every right-feeling man.    [Sidenote: PERSONAL CLEANLINESS]    After all, however grand the physical scenery, the meteorological  phenomena, may be, the people of any country are the most interesting  thing in it, and we found these Esquimaux extraordinarily interesting.  Dirty they certainly are; it is almost impossible for dwellers in the  arctic regions to be clean in the winter, and the winter lasts so long  that the habit of winter becomes the habit of the year. White and native  alike accept a lower standard of personal cleanliness than is tolerated  outside. I remember asking Bishop Rowe, before I came to Alaska: \"What  do you do about bathing when you travel in the winter?\" To which he  replied laconically: \"Do without.\" It is even so; travellers on the  Alaskan trails as well as natives belong to the \"great unwashed.\" In the  very cold weather the procuring of water in any quantity is a very  difficult thing even for house dwellers. Every drop of it has to be  carried from a water-hole cut far out on the ice, up a steep grade, and  then quite a little distance back to the dwelling--for we do not build  directly upon these eroding banks. The water-hole is continually  freezing up and has to be continually hewed free of ice, and as the  streams dwindle with the progress of winter, new holes must be cut  farther and farther out. On the trail, where snow must usually be melted  for water, it is obvious that bathing is out of the question; even the  water for hands and face is sparingly doled by the cook, and two people  will sometimes use the same water rather than resort to the painful  though efficient expedient of washing with snow. If this be so despite  aluminum pots and a full kit of camp vessels, it is much more so with  the native, whose supply of pots and pans is very limited. I have seen a  white man melt snow in a frying-pan, wash hands and face in it, throw it  out, fry bacon and beans in it, then melt more snow and wash his cup and  plate in it. There is, however, this to be said anent the disuse of the  bath in this country, that in cold weather most men perspire very little  indeed, and the perspiration that is exuded passes through to the outer  garments and is immediately deposited upon them as frost; and there is  this further to be said about dirt in general, that one blessed property  of the cold is to kill all odours.    One grows tolerant of dirt in this country; there is no denying it, and  it is well that it is so; otherwise one would be in a chronic state of  disgust with oneself and every one else. So the dirt of the native,  unless specially prominent and offensive, is accepted as a matter of  course and ignored. This obstacle overcome, the Esquimaux are an  attractive and most interesting race, and compare to advantage with the  Indians in almost every particular. They are a very industrious people.  Go into an Esquimau's hut at almost any time when they are not sleeping,  and you will find every individual occupied at some task. Here is a man  working in wood or bone with the ingenious tools they have evolved; here  are women working in skin or fur, and some of them are admirable  needlewomen; here, perhaps, is another woman chewing mukluks--and many a  white man who has kept his feet dry in overflow water is grateful to the  teeth that do not disdain this most effective way of securing an  intimate union between sole and upper. Even the children are busy: here  is a boy whittling out bow and arrow--and they do great execution  amongst rabbits and ptarmigan with these weapons that entail no cost of  powder and shot; here is a girl beating out threads from sinew with a  couple of flat stones. Some of us, troubled with unconscientious  tailors, wish that a law could be passed requiring all buttons to be  sewn on with sinew--they never come off.    [Sidenote: A LIGHT-HEARTED FOLK]    They are a very light-hearted people, easily amused, bubbling over with  laughter and merriment, romping and skylarking with one another at every  intermission of labour. One of my white travelling companions on this  journey was in the habit of using a little piece of rabbit skin to  protect his nose in cold or windy weather. The care of the nose is  sometimes very troublesome indeed, it freezes more readily than any  other portion of the body; and a little piece of rabbit skin, moistened  and applied to the nose, will stay there and keep it warm and  comfortable all day. But it does not exactly enhance one's personal  attractions.    We had stopped for camp and were all together for the first time in four  or five hours, when Roxy noticed this rabbit-skin nose protector, upon  which the breath had condensed all the afternoon until two long icicles  depended from it, one on each side, reaching down below the mouth; and  he fell straightway into a fit of laughter that grew uncontrollable; he  rolled on the snow and roared. A little annoyed at this exhibition, I  spoke sharply: \"What's the matter with you, Roxy; what on earth are you  cutting up like that for?\" Checking himself for a moment, he pointed to  my companion and said, \"Alleesame _walrus_,\" and went off into another  paroxysm of laughter, rolling about and roaring. At intervals all the  evening he would break out again, and when we sat down to eat it  overcame him once more and he rushed outside where he could give vent to  his mirth with less offence.    The boy was straightforward and conscientious. We were camped over  Sunday once, and Roxy had noticed many marten tracks in the  neighbourhood. He had brought a few traps along with him to set out as  we went and pick up on his return, and he wanted to know if I thought he  might set some that day, although it was the day of rest.
