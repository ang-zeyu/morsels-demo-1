Plunging into the gloom of the firs, where the trail led over a  snow-covered chaos of boulders and tangled windfalls, she came  presently to a spot where the snow was disturbed and scratched. Her  eyes sparkled greedily. There were spatters of blood about the place,  and she realized that here the lynx had buried, for a future meal,  the remnant of his kill.    Her keen nose speedily told her just where the treasure was hidden,  and she fell to digging furiously with her short, powerful fore paws.  It was a bitter and lean season, and the lynx, after eating his fill,  had taken care to bury the remnant deep. The carcajou burrowed down  till only the tip of her dingy tail was visible before she found the  object of her search. It proved to be nothing but one hind quarter of  a little blue fox. Angrily she dragged it forth and bolted it in a  twinkling, crunching the slim bone between her powerful jaws. It was  but a morsel to such a hunger as hers. Licking her chops, and passing  her black paws hurriedly over her face, as a cat does, she forsook the  trail of the lynx and wandered on deeper into the soundless gloom.  Several rabbit-tracks she crossed, and here and there the dainty trail  of a ptarmigan, or the small, sequential dots of a weasel's foot. But  a single glance or passing twitch of her nostril told her these were  all old, and she vouchsafed them no attention. It was not till she had  gone perhaps a quarter of a mile through the fir-glooms that she came  upon a trail which caused her to halt.    It was the one trail, this, among all the tracks that traversed the  great snow, which could cause her a moment's perturbation. For the  trail of the wolf-pack she had small concern--for the hungriest wolves  could never climb a tree. But this was the broad snowshoe trail, which  she knew was made by a creature even more crafty than herself. She  glanced about keenly, peering under the trees--because one could never  judge, merely by the direction of the trail, where one of those  dangerous creatures was going. She stood almost erect on her haunches  and sniffed the air for the slightest taint of danger. Then she  sniffed at the tracks. The man-smell was strong upon them, and  comparatively, but not dangerously, fresh. Reassured on this point,  she decided to follow the man and find out what he was doing. It was  only when she did not know what he was about that she so dreaded him.  Given the opportunity to watch him unseen, she was willing enough to  pit her cunning against his, and to rob him as audaciously as she  would rob any of the wilderness kindreds.    Hunting over a wide range as she did, the carcajou was unaware till  now that a man had come upon her range that winter. To her experience  a man meant a hunter--and--trapper, with emphasis distinctly upon the  trapper. The man's gun she feared--but his traps she feared not at  all. Indeed, she regarded them rather with distinct favour, and was  ready to profit by them at the first opportunity. Having only strength  and cunning, but no speed to rely upon, she had learned that traps  could catch all kinds of swift creatures, and hold them inexorably.  She had learned, too, that there was usually a succession of traps and  snares set along a man's trail. It was with some exciting expectation,  now, that she applied herself to following this trail.    Within a short distance the track brought her to a patch of trampled  snow, with tiny bits of frozen fish scattered about. She knew at once  that somewhere in this disturbed area a trap was hidden, close to the  surface. Stepping warily, in a circle, she picked up and devoured the  smallest scraps. Near the centre lay a fragment of tempting size; but  she cunningly guessed that close beside that morsel would be the  hiding-place of the trap. Slowly she closed in upon it, her nose close  to the snow, sniffing with cautious discrimination. Suddenly she  stopped short. Through the snow she had detected the man-smell, and  the smell of steel, mingling with the savour of the dried fish. Here,  but a little to one side, she began to dig, and promptly uncovered a  light chain. Following this she came presently to the trap itself,  which she cautiously laid bare. Then, without misgiving, she ate the  big piece of fish. Both her curiosity and her hunger, however, were  still far from satisfied, so she again took up the trail.    The next trap she came to was an open snare--a noose of bright wire  suspended near the head of a cunningly constructed alley of fir  branches, leading up to the foot of a big hemlock. Just behind this  noose, and hardly to be reached save through the noose, the bait had  evidently been fixed. But the carcajou saw that some one little less  cunning than herself had been before her. Such a snare would have  caught the fierce, but rather stupid, lynx; but a fox had been the  first arrival. She saw his tracks. He had carefully investigated the  alley of fir branches from the outside. Then he had broken through it  behind the noose, and safely made off with the bait. Rather  contemptuously the old wolverene went on. She did not understand this  kind of trap, so she discreetly refrained from meddling with it.    [Illustration: \"CREPT SLOWLY AROUND THE RAGING AND SNARLING CAPTIVE.\"]    Fully a quarter mile she had to go before she came to another; but  here she found things altogether different and more interesting. As  she came softly around a great snow-draped boulder there was a snarl,  a sharp rattle of steel, and a thud. She shrank back swiftly, just  beyond reach of the claws of a big lynx. The lynx had been ahead of  her in discovering the trap, and with the stupidity of his tribe had  got caught in it. The inexorable steel jaws had him fast by the left  fore leg. He had heard the almost soundless approach of the strange  prowler, and, mad with pain and rage, had sprung to the attack without  waiting to see the nature of his antagonist.    Keeping just beyond the range of his hampered leap, the carcajou now  crept slowly around the raging and snarling captive, who kept pouncing  at her in futile fury every other moment. Though his superior in sheer  strength, she was much smaller and lighter than he, and less  murderously armed for combat; and she dreaded the raking, eviscerating  clutch of his terrible hinder claws. In defence of her burrow and her  litter, she would have tackled him without hesitation; but her sharp  teeth and bulldog jaw, however efficient, would not avail, in such a  combat, to save her from getting ripped almost to ribbons. She was far  too sagacious to enter upon any such struggle unnecessarily. Prowling  slowly and tirelessly, without effort, around and around the excited  prisoner, she trusted to wear him out and then take him at some deadly  disadvantage.    Weighted with the trap, and not wise enough to refrain from wasting  his strength in vain struggles, the lynx was strenuously playing his  cunning antagonist's game, when a sound came floating on the still air  which made them both instantly rigid. It was a long, thin, wavering  cry that died off with indescribable melancholy in its cadence. The  lynx crouched, with eyes dilating, and listened with terrible  intentness. The carcajou, equally interested but not terrified, stood  erect, ears, eyes and nose alike directed to finding out more about  that ominous voice. Again and again it was repeated, swiftly coming  nearer; and presently it resolved itself into a chorus of voices. The  lynx made several convulsive bounds, wrenching desperately to free his  imprisoned limb; then, recognizing the inevitable, he crouched again,  shuddering but dangerous, his tufted ears flattened upon his back,  his eyes flickering green, every tooth and claw bared for the last  battle. But the carcajou merely stiffened up her fur, in a rage at the  prospective interruption of her hunting. She knew well that the  dreadful, melancholy cry was the voice of the wolf-pack. But the  wolves were not on _her_ trail, that she was sure of; and possibly  they might pass at a harmless distance, and not discover her or her  quarry.    The listeners were not kept long in suspense. The pack, as it chanced,  was on the trail of a moose which, labouring heavily in the deep snow,  had passed, at a distance of some thirty or forty yards, a few minutes  before the carcajou's arrival. The wolves swept into view through the  tall fir trunks--five in number, and running so close that a  table-cloth might have covered them. They knew by the trail that the  quarry must be near, and, urged on by the fierce thrust of their  hunger, they were not looking to right or left. They were almost past,  and the lynx was beginning to take heart again, when, out of the tail  of his eye, the pack-leader detected something unusual on the snow  near the foot of the big rock. One fair look explained it all to him.  With an exultant yelp he turned, and the pack swept down upon the  prisoner; while the carcajou, bursting with indignation, slipped up  the nearest tree.    The captive was not abject, but game to the last tough fibre. All  fangs and rending claws, with a screech and a bound he met the  onslaught of the pack; and, for all the hideous handicap of that thing  of iron on his leg, he gave a good account of himself. For a minute or  two the wolves and their victim formed one yelling, yelping heap. When  it disentangled itself, three of the wolves were badly torn, and one  had the whole side of his face laid open. But in a few minutes there  was nothing left of the unfortunate lynx but a few of the heavier  bones--to which the pack might return later--and the scrap of fur and  flesh that was held in the jaws of the trap.    [Illustration: \"SNAPPED BACK AT HIM WITH A VICIOUS GROWL.\"]    As the carcajou saw her prospective meal disappearing, her rage became  almost uncontrollable, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#16)"],[1," The habits  and nesting habits of the Ring-neck do not differ from those of the  other Scaups. They lay from six to twelve eggs. Size 2.25 x 1.60.  Data.--Cape Bathurst, N. Y. T., June 18, 1901. Ten eggs in a slight  hollow in the moss, lined with down. Collector, Captain Bodfish.    [Illustration 100: Lesser Scaup Duck. Ring-necked Duck.]  [Illustration: Lead gray.]  [Illustration: deco-photo.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 99    151. GOLDEN-EYE. _Clangula clangula americana._    Range.--North America, breeding both on the coast and in the interior,  from the northern border of the United States northward to the Arctic  Ocean.    These are handsome Ducks known as \"Whistlers\" from the noise of their  wings when flying, and \"Greatheads\" because of the puffy crest. The head  is greenish with a large round white spot in front of, and a little  below the eye. The rest of the plumage is black and white. This species  nests in hollow trees near the water, lining the cavity with grass, moss  and leaves, and lining the nest with down from their breasts. In May and  June they lay from six to ten eggs of a grayish green color. Size 2.30 x  1.70.      152. BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE. _Clangula islandica._    Range.--Northern North America, breeding north of the United States  except from the mountainous portions of Colorado northward.    This Golden-eye differs from the preceding chiefly in the shape of the  white spot before the eye, which in this species is in the form of a  crescent. The size is the same, about 20 inches in length. The  reflections on the head are purplish rather than greenish as in the  preceding. The nesting habits are the same, they building in hollow  trees near water. The six to ten eggs are not different from the  preceding. Size 2.30 x 1.65. Data.--Alfusa, Iceland, June 30, 1900.  Seven eggs. Nest of grass and down in a box attached to a tree by an  islander.    [Illustration 101: Grayish green.]  [Illustration: American Golden-eye. Barrow Golden-eye.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 100    153. BUFFLE-HEAD. _Charitonetta albeola._    Range.--North America, breeding from United States northward. Winters  south to Mexico.    Gunners know this handsome little duck by the names of \"Butter-ball,\"  and \"Dipper,\" a name also given to Grebes. It is also quite similar, but  smaller (15 in. long), to the American Golden-eye but has a large white  patch on the back of the head, from eye to eye. It is an active bird  and, like the two preceding, is capable of diving to a great depth to  get its food. Its nesting habits are like the preceding. Eggs eight to  fourteen. Size 2 x 1.40. Data.--Alberta, Canada, June 6, 1899. Seven  eggs. Nest in hole in tree stump, lined with down. Collector, Dr.  George.      154. OLD-SQUAW. _Harelda hyemalis._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the Arctic regions; south in  winter to New Jersey and Illinois.    The Long-tailed Duck, as it is called, is especially noticeable because  the breeding plumage of the male differs markedly from that in the  winter. In summer their general plumage is blackish brown, with a white  patch around the eye, and white belly. In winter they are largely white.  The central tail feathers are much lengthened. They breed abundantly in  Greenland, Alaska and the Hudson Bay Territory, placing their nests of  grasses and weeds on the ground near the water. It is generally  concealed in the long grass. The eggs number from six to twelve. Size 2.  x 1.50. Data.--N. Iceland, June 10, 1900. Nest on ground, lined with  down. Collector, S. H. Wallis.    [Illustration 102: Dull buff.]  [Illustration: Buffle-head. Old-squaw.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 101    155. HARLEQUIN DUCK. _Histrionicus histrionicus._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere in America, breeding from Newfoundland and  the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, northward. South in winter to  California and New England.    A beautiful and most gorgeous bird, not in colors, but in the oddity of  the markings, the colors only including black, white, gray and chestnut.  Either sex can be recognized by the small short bill. They breed mostly  in single pairs along swiftly running streams, placing their nest, which  is woven of weeds and grasses, in the ground near the water. It is also  claimed that they sometimes nest in hollow trees. They lay from five to  eight eggs, yellowish or greenish buff in color. Size 2.30 x 1.60.  Data.--Peel River, Alaska, June 13, 1898. Seven eggs in a hollow in  river bank, lined with down. Collector, C. E. Whittaker.      156. LABRADOR DUCK. _Camptorhynchus labradorius._    This bird, whose range was from Labrador to New Jersey in the winter,  has probably been extinct since 1875, when the last authentic capture  was made. It is a strange fact that a bird of this character should have  been completely exterminated, even though they were often sold in the  markets. Only forty-one specimens are known to be preserved at present  and nothing is known in regard to their nesting habits or eggs.    [Illustration 103: Greenish buff.]  [Illustration: Harlequin Duck. Labrador Duck.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 102    157. STELLER'S DUCK. _Polysticta stelleri._    Range.--Arctic regions in America, chiefly on the Aleutian Islands and  northwest coast of Alaska.    A very beautiful species eighteen inches long; head white, washed with  greenish on the forehead and nape; chin, throat, neck, back, tail and  crissum, black; underparts chestnut; wing coverts white, the long  scapulars black and white. It breeds on the rocky coasts and islands of  Bering Sea. The six to nine eggs are pale olive green in color. Size  2.25 x 1.60. Data.--Admiralty Bay, Alaska, June 22, 1898. Nest on a  hummock of the tundra, near a small pool, lined with grass and down.  Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.      158. SPECTACLED EIDER. _Arctonetta fischeri._    Range.--Coast of Alaska from the Aleutians to Point Barrow.    Like the rest of the true Eiders, this species is black beneath and  mostly white above. The head is largely washed with sea green, leaving a  large patch of white, narrowly bordered by black around each eye, thus  resembling a pair of spectacles. The nests are made of grass and seaweed  and lined with down; they are placed on the ground in clumps of grass or  beneath overhanging stones. The five to nine eggs are an olive drab or  greenish color. Size 2.70 x 1.85. Data.--Point Barrow, Alaska, June 15,  1898. Six eggs. Nest of moss and down in a hollow in dry tundra.  Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.      159. NORTHERN EIDER. _Somateria mollissima borealis._    Range.--North Atlantic coast, breeding from Labrador to Greenland and  wintering south to New England.    A large Duck similar to the next species, but with the base of the bill  differing, as noted in the description of the following species, and  with a more northerly distribution. The nesting habits are the same as  those of the other Eiders. Six to ten eggs generally of a greenish drab  color. Size 3. x 2.    [Illustration 104: Steller's Duck. Spectacled Eider.]  [Illustration: Pale olive green.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 103    160. EIDER. _Somateria dresseri._    Range.--Atlantic coast, breeding from Maine to Labrador and wintering  south to Delaware.    This species differs from the preceding only in the fleshy part of the  base of the bill, which extends back on each side of the forehead, it  being broad and rounded in this species and narrow and pointed in the  Northern or Greenland Eider. This species, but more especially the  Northern Eider, are the ones chiefly used for the eider-down of  commerce. The preceding species is often semi-domesticated in Greenland,  the people protecting them and encouraging them to nest in the  neighborhood. They make their nests of seaweed and grass and warmly line  it with down from their breast; this down is continually added to the  nest during incubation until there is a considerable amount in each  nest, averaging about an ounce in weight. The birds are among the  strongest of the sea ducks and get their food in very deep water. Their  flesh is not good eating. Their eggs number from five to ten and are  greenish drab. Size 3. x 2.      161. PACIFIC EIDER. _Somateria v-nigra._    Range.--North Pacific from the Aleutian Islands northward, and east to  Great Slave Lake.    This bird is, in plumage, like the Northern Eider, except that it has a  black V-shaped mark on the throat. They nest sparingly on the Aleutian  Islands, but in great numbers farther north on the coast about Point  Barrow. Their habits, nests and eggs are precisely the same as those of  the eastern forms. Their eggs number from five to ten and are of olive  greenish color. Size 3. x 2. Data.--Cape Smythe, Alaska, June 8, 1900.  Eight eggs. Nest a hollow in the moss, lined with grass and down.    [Illustration 105: Greenish drab.]  [Illustration: Eider. Pacific Eider.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 104    162. KING EIDER. _Somateria spectabilis._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America from Labrador to  Greenland and the Arctic Ocean; south in winter to the New England  States and rarely farther on the eastern side, and to the Aleutians on  the Pacific; also casually to the Great Lakes in the interior.    A handsome and very different species from any of the foregoing, having  the crown ashy blue, and the long scapulars black instead of white. It  also has a broad V-shaped mark on the throat. Like all the other Eiders,  the female is mottled brown and black, the different species being very  difficult to separate. The nests are sunk in the ground and lined with  down. Eggs number from six to ten. Size 2.80 x 1.80. Data.--Point  Barrow, Alaska, July 5, 1898. Five eggs. Nest a hollow in the moss on  tundra lined with moss and down. Collector, E. A.
