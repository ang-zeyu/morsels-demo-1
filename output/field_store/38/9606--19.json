The only answer to this question seems to be  that Chephren built the second pyramid in hopes of finding out why his  brother had built the first, and this answer is simply absurd. It is  clear enough that whatever purpose Cheops had in building the first  pyramid, Chephren must have had a similar purpose in building the  second; and we require a theory which shall at least explain why the  first pyramid did not subserve for Chephren the purpose which it  subserved or was meant to subserve for Cheops. The same reasoning may be  extended to the third pyramid, to the fourth, and in fine to all the  pyramids, forty or so in number, included under the general designation  of the Pyramids of Ghizeh or Jeezeh. The extension of the principle to  pyramids later than the second is especially important as showing that  the difference of religion insisted on by Smyth has no direct bearing on  the question of the purpose for which the Great Pyramid itself was  constructed. For Mycerinus either never left or else returned to the  religion of the Egyptians. Yet he also built a pyramid, which, though  far inferior in size to the pyramids built by his father and uncle, was  still a massive structure, and relatively more costly even than theirs,  because built of expensive granite. The pyramid built by Asychis, though  smaller still, was remarkable as built of brick; in fact, we are  expressly told that Asychis desired to eclipse all his predecessors in  such labours, and accordingly left this brick pyramid as a monument of  his reign.    We are forced, in fact, to believe that there was some special relation  between the pyramid and its builder, seeing that each one of these kings  wanted a pyramid of his own. This applies to the Great Pyramid quite as  much as to the others, despite the superior excellence of that  structure. Or rather, the argument derives its chief force from the  superiority of the Great Pyramid. If Chephren, no longer perhaps having  the assistance of the shepherd-architects in planning and superintending  the work, was unable to construct a pyramid so perfect and so stately as  his brother's, the very fact that he nevertheless built a pyramid shows  that the Great Pyramid did not fulfil for Chephren the purpose which it  fulfilled for Cheops. But, if Smyth's theory were true, the Great  Pyramid would have fulfilled finally and for all men the purpose for  which it was built. Since this was manifestly not the case, that theory  is, I submit, demonstrably erroneous.    It was probably the consideration of this point, viz. that each king had  a pyramid constructed for himself, which led to the theory that the  pyramids were intended to serve as tombs. This theory was once very  generally entertained. Thus we find Humboldt, in his remarks on American  pyramids, referring to the tomb theory of the Egyptian pyramids as  though it were open to no question. 'When we consider,' he says, 'the  pyramidical monuments of Egypt, of Asia, and of the New Continent, from  the same point of view, we see that, though their form is alike, their  destination was altogether different. The group of pyramids of Ghizeh  and at Sakhara in Egypt; the triangular pyramid of the Queen of the  Scythians, Zarina, which was a stadium high and three in circumference,  and which was decorated with a colossal figure; the fourteen Etruscan  pyramids, which are said to have been enclosed in the labyrinth of the  king Porsenna, at Clusium--were reared to serve as the sepulchres of the  illustrious dead. Nothing is more natural to men than to commemorate the  spot where rest the ashes of those whose memory they cherish whether it  be, as in the infancy of the race, by simple mounds of earth, or, in  later periods, by the towering height of the tumulus. Those of the  Chinese and of Thibet have only a few metres of elevation. Farther to  the west the dimensions increase; the tumulus of the king Alyattes,  father of Croesus, in Lydia, was six stadia, and that of Ninus was  more than ten stadia in diameter. In the north of Europe the sepulchre  of the Scandinavian king Gormus and the queen Daneboda, covered with  mounds of earth, are three hundred metres broad, and more than thirty  high.'    But while we have abundant reason for believing that in Egypt, even in  the days of Cheops and Chephren, extreme importance was attached to the  character of the place of burial for distinguished persons, there is  nothing in what is known respecting earlier Egyptian ideas to suggest  the probability that any monarch would have devoted many years of his  subjects' labour, and vast stores of material, to erect a mass of  masonry like the Great Pyramid, solely to receive his own body after  death. Far less have we any reason for supposing that many monarchs in  succession would do this, each having a separate tomb built for him. It  might have been conceivable, had only the Great Pyramid been erected,  that the structure had been raised as a mausoleum for all the kings and  princes of the dynasty. But it seems utterly incredible that such a  building as the Great Pyramid should have been erected for one king's  body only--and that, not in the way described by Humboldt, when he  speaks of men commemorating the spot where rest the remains of those  whose memory they cherish, but at the expense of the king himself whose  body was to be there deposited. Besides, the first pyramid, the one  whose history must be regarded as most significant of the true purpose  of these buildings, was not built by an Egyptian holding in great favour  the special religious ideas of his people, but by one who had adopted  other views and those not belonging, so far as can be seen, to a people  among whom sepulchral rites were held in exceptional regard.    A still stronger objection against the exclusively tombic theory  resides in the fact that this theory gives no account whatever of the  characteristic features of the pyramids themselves. These buildings are  all, without exception, built on special astronomical principles. Their  square bases are so placed as to have two sides lying east and west, and  two lying north and south, or, in other words, so that their four faces  front the four cardinal points. One can imagine no reason why a tomb  should have such a position. It is not, indeed, easy to understand why  any building at all, except an astronomical observatory, should have  such a position. A temple perhaps devoted to sun-worship, and generally  to the worship of the heavenly bodies, might be built in that way. For  it is to be noticed that the peculiar figure and position of the  pyramids would bring about the following relations:--When the sun rose  and set south of the east and west points, or (speaking generally)  between the autumn and the spring equinoxes, the rays of the rising and  setting sun illuminated the southern face of the pyramid; whereas during  the rest of the year, that is, during the six months between the spring  and autumn equinoxes, the rays of the rising and setting sun illuminated  the northern face. Again, all the year round the sun's rays passed from  the eastern to the western face at solar noon. And lastly, during seven  months and a half of each year, namely, for three months and three  quarters before and after midsummer, the noon rays of the sun fell on  all four faces of the pyramid, or, according to a Peruvian expression  (so Smyth avers), the sun shone on the pyramid 'with all his rays.' Such  conditions as these might have been regarded as very suitable for a  temple devoted to sun-worship. Yet the temple theory is as untenable as  the tomb theory. For, in the first place, the pyramid form--as the  pyramids were originally built, with perfectly smooth slant-faces, not  terraced into steps as now through the loss of the casing-stones--was  entirely unsuited for all the ordinary requirements of a temple of  worship. And further, this theory gives no explanation of the fact that  each king built a pyramid, and each king only one. Similar difficulties  oppose the theory that the pyramids were intended to serve as  astronomical observatories. For while their original figure, however  manifestly astronomical in its relations, was quite unsuited for  observatory work, it is manifest that if such had been the purpose of  pyramid-building, so soon as the Great Pyramid had once been built, no  other would be needed. Certainly none of the pyramids built afterwards  could have subserved any astronomical purpose which the first did not  subserve, or have subserved nearly so well as the Great Pyramid those  purposes (and they are but few) which that building may be supposed to  have fulfilled as an astronomical observatory.    Of the other theories mentioned at the beginning of this paper none seem  to merit special notice, except perhaps the theory that the pyramids  were made to receive the royal treasures, and this theory rather because  of the attention it received from Arabian literati, during the ninth and  tenth centuries, than because of any strong reasons which can be  suggested in its favour. 'Emulating,' says Professor Smyth, 'the  enchanted tales of Bagdad,' the court poets of Al Mamoun (son of the  far-famed Haroun al Raschid) 'drew gorgeous pictures of the contents of  the pyramid's interior.... All the treasures of Sheddad Ben Ad the great  Antediluvian king of the earth, with all his medicines and all his  sciences, they declared were there, told over and over again. Others,  though, were positive that the founder-king was no other than Saurid Ibn  Salhouk, a far greater one than the other; and these last gave many more  minute particulars, some of which are at least interesting to us in the  present day, as proving that, amongst the Egypto-Arabians of more than  a thousand years ago, the Jeezeh pyramids, headed by the grand one,  enjoyed a pre-eminence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#16)"],[1," and coarse-grained. Best developed in the lower basin of the  Ohio, but found from Minnesota to Florida.    =87. Live Oak= (_Quercus virens_) (Maul Oak). Medium- to large-sized  tree. Grows from Maryland to the Gulf of Mexico, and often attains a  height of 60 feet and 4 feet in diameter. The wood is hard, strong,  and durable, but of rather rapid growth, therefore not as good quality  as _Quercus alba_. The live oak of Florida is now reserved by the  United States Government for Naval purposes. Used for mauls and  mallets, tool handles, etc., and locally for construction. Scattered  along the coast from Maryland to Texas.    =88. Live Oak= (_Quercus chrysolepis_) (Maul Oak, Valparaiso Oak).  Medium- to small-sized tree. California.                                   OSAGE ORANGE    =89. Osage Orange= (_Maclura aurantiaca_) (Bois d'Arc). A small-sized  tree of fairly rapid growth. Wood very heavy, exceedingly hard,  strong, not tough, of moderately coarse texture, and very durable and  elastic. Sapwood yellow, heartwood brown on the end face, yellow on  the longitudinal faces, soon turning grayish brown if exposed. It  shrinks considerably in drying, but once dry it stands unusually well.  Much used for wheel stock, and wagon framing; it is easily split, so  is unfit for wheel hubs, but is very suitable for wheel spokes. It is  considered one of the timbers likely to supply the place of black  locust for insulator pins on telegraph poles. Seems too little  appreciated; it is well suited for turned ware and especially for  woodcarving. Used for spokes, insulator pins, posts, railway ties,  wagon framing, turnery, and woodcarving. Scattered through the rich  bottoms of Arkansas and Texas.                                       PAPAW    =90. Papaw= (_Asimina triloba_) (Custard Apple). Small-sized tree, often  only a shrub, Heartwood pale, yellowish green, sapwood lighter color.  Wood light, soft, coarse-grained, and spongy. Not used to any extent  in manufacture. Occurs in eastern and central Pennsylvania, west as  far as Michigan and Kansas, and south to Florida and Texas. Often  forming dense thickets in the lowlands bordering the Mississippi  River.                                     PERSIMMON    =91. Persimmon= (_Diospyros Virginiana_). Small to medium-sized tree.  Wood very heavy, and hard, strong and tough; resembles hickory, but is  of finer texture and elastic, but liable to split in working. The  broad sapwood cream color, the heartwood brown, sometimes almost  black. The persimmon is the Virginia date plum, a tree of 30 to 50  feet high, and 18 to 20 inches in diameter; it is noted chiefly for  its fruit, but it produces a wood of considerable value. Used in  turnery, for wood engraving, shuttles, bobbins, plane stock, shoe lasts,  and largely as a substitute for box (_Buxus sempervirens_)--especially  the black or Mexican variety,--also used for pocket rules and drawing  scales, for flutes and other wind instruments. Common, and best  developed in the lower Ohio Valley, but occurs from New York to Texas  and Missouri.                           POPLAR (See also Tulip Wood)    Wood light, very soft, not strong, of fine texture, and whitish,  grayish to yellowish color, usually with a satiny luster. The wood  shrinks moderately (some cross-grained forms warp excessively), but  checks very little in seasoning; is easily worked, but is not durable.  Used in cooperage, for building and furniture lumber, for crates and  boxes (especially cracker boxes), for woodenware, and paper pulp.    =92. Cottonwood= (_Populus monilifera_, var. _angulata_) (Carolina  Poplar). Large-sized tree, forms considerable forests along many of  the Western streams, and furnishes most of the cottonwood of the  market. Heartwood dark brown, sapwood nearly white.

Very common. Heartwood dull brown, sapwood lighter brown.  Wood soft, close-grained. Is now manufactured into lumber in the West  and South, and used in interior finish of buildings. Northern Rocky  Mountains and Pacific region.    =95. Poplar= (_Populus grandidentata_) (Large-Toothed Aspen).  Medium-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood  soft and close-grained, neither strong nor durable. Chiefly used for  wood pulp. Maine to Minnesota and southward along the Alleghanies.    =96. White Poplar= (_Populus alba_) (Abele-Tree). Small to medium-sized  tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to the preceding. Found  principally along banks of streams, never forming forests. Widely  distributed in the United States.    =97. Lombardy Poplar= (_Populus nigra italica_). Medium-to large-sized  tree. This species is the first ornamental tree introduced into the  United States, and originated in Afghanistan. Does not enter into the  markets. Widely planted in the United States.    =98. Balsam= (_Populus balsamifera_) (Balm of Gilead, Tacmahac). Medium-  to large-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood  light, soft, not strong, close-grained. Used extensively in the  manufacture of paper pulp.

Heartwood reddish brown,  sapwood lighter color. Wood heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, and  takes a fine polish. Ranges from Pennsylvania, along the Alleghanies,  to Florida and Alabama, westward through Ohio to southern Indiana and  southward through Arkansas and Louisiana to the Coast.                                SWEET GUM (See Gum)                                     SYCAMORE    =102. Sycamore= (_Platanus occidentalis_) (Buttonwood, Button-Ball Tree,  Plane Tree, Water Beech). A large-sized tree, of rapid growth. One of  the largest deciduous trees of the United States, sometimes attaining  a height of 100 feet. It produces a timber that is moderately heavy,  quite hard, stiff, strong, and tough, usually cross-grained; of coarse  texture, difficult to split and work, shrinks moderately, but warps  and checks considerably in seasoning, but stands well, and is not  considered durable for outside work, or in contact with the soil. It  has broad medullary rays, and much of the timber has a beautiful  figure. It is used in slack cooperage, and quite extensively for  drawers, backs, and bottoms, etc., in furniture work. It is also used  for cabinet work, for tobacco boxes, crates, desks, flooring,  furniture, ox-yokes, butcher blocks, and also for finishing lumber,  where it has too long been underrated. Common and largest in the Ohio  and Mississippi Valleys, at home in nearly all parts of the eastern  United States.    =103. Sycamore= (_Platanus racemosa_). The California species,  resembling in its wood the Eastern form. Not used to any great extent.                                    TULIP TREE    =104. Tulip Tree= (_Liriodendron tulipifera_) (Yellow Poplar, Tulip  Wood, White Wood, Canary Wood, Poplar, Blue Poplar, White Poplar,  Hickory Poplar). A medium- to large-sized tree, does not form forests,  but is quite common, especially in the Ohio basin. Wood usually light,  but varies in weight, it is soft, tough, but not strong, of fine  texture, and yellowish color. The wood shrinks considerably, but  seasons without much injury, and works and stands extremely well.  Heartwood light yellow or greenish brown, the sapwood is thin, nearly  white, and decays rapidly. The heartwood is fairly durable when  exposed to the weather or in contact with the soil. It bends readily  when steamed, and takes stain and paint well. The mature forest-grown  tree has a long, straight, cylindrical bole, clear of branches for at  least two thirds of its length, surmounted by a short, open, irregular  crown. When growing in the open, the tree maintains a straight stem,  but the crown extends almost to the ground, and is of conical shape.  Yellow poplar, or tulip wood, ordinarily grows to a height of from 100  to 125 feet, with a diameter of from 3 to 6 feet, and a clear length  of about 70 feet. Trees have been found 190 feet high and ten feet in  diameter. Used in cooperage, for siding, for panelling and finishing  lumber in houses, car- and shipbuilding, for sideboards, panels of  wagons and carriages, for aeroplanes, for automobiles, also in the  manufacture of furniture farm implements, machinery, for pump logs,  and almost every kind of"]]]
