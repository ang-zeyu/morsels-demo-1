The black buck (Antilope cerricapra) can still  be shot in many places. The graceful little _chinkara_ or ravine deer  (Gazella Bennetti) is found in sandy tracts, and the hogdeer or _parha_  (Cervus porcinus) near rivers. The _nilgai_ (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is  less common. Monkeys abound in the hills and in canal-irrigated tracts  in the Eastern districts, where their sacred character protects them  from destruction, though they do much damage to crops. Peafowl are to be  seen in certain tracts, especially in the eastern Panjab. They should  not be shot where the people are Hindus or anywhere near a Hindu shrine.  The great and lesser bustards and several kinds of sand grouse are to be  found in sandy districts. The grey partridge is everywhere, and the  black can be got near the rivers. The _sisi_ and the _chikor_ are the  partridges of the hills, which are also the home of fine varieties of  pheasants including the _monal_. Quail frequent the ripening fields in  April and late in September. Duck of various kinds abound where there  are _jhils_, and snipe are to be got in marshy ground. The green  parrots, crows, and vultures are familiar sights. Both the sharp-nosed  (Garialis Gangetica, vern. _gharial_) and the blunt-nosed (Crocodilus  palustris, vern. magar) crocodiles haunt the rivers. The fish are  tasteless; the _rohu_ and _mahseer_ are the best. Poisonous snakes are  the _karait_, the _cobra_, and Russell's viper. The first is sometimes  an intruder into houses. Lizards and mongooses are less unwelcome  visitors. White ants attack timber and ruin books, and mosquitoes and  sandflies add to the unpleasant features of the hot weather. The best  known insect pest is the locust, but visitations on a large scale are  rare. Of late years much more damage has been done by an insect which  harbours in the cotton bolls.

Some areas and the heights at which  the game is to be found are noted below:      (_a_) Goats and goat-antelopes:      1. Ibex (Capra Sibirica) 10,000-14,000 ft.    Kashmir, Lahul, Bashahr.      2. Markhor (Capra Falconeri). Kashmir, Astor,    Gilgit, Suliman hills.      3. Thar (Hemitragus jemlaicus), 9000-14,000    ft. Kashmir, Chamba.      4. Gural (Cemas goral), 3000-8000 ft. Kashmir,    Chamba, Simla hills, Bashahr.      5. Serow (Nemorhaedus bubalinus), 6000-12,000    ft. From Kashmir eastwards.      (_b_) Sheep:      1. Bharal (Ovis nahura), 10,000-12,000 ft. and    over. Ladakh, Bashahr.      2. Argali (Ovis Ammon). Ladakh.      3. Urial (Ovis Vignei)  Salt Range, Suliman    hills.      (_c_) Antelopes:      1. Chiru or Tibetan Antelope (Pantholops hodgsoni).    Ladakh.      (_d_) Oxen--Yak (Bos grunniens). Ladakh.  The    domesticated _yak_ is invaluable as a beast of    burden in the Trans-Himalayan tract. The    royal fly whisk or _chauri_ is made from pure    white yak tails.    [Illustration: Fig. 25. Yaks.]      (_e_) Stag:      1. Barasingha (Cervus Duvanceli). Foot of    Himalaya in Kashmir.      (_f_) Bears:      1. Red or Brown (Ursus Arctos), 10,000-13,000    ft. Kashmir, Chamba, Bashahr, etc.      2. Black (Ursus torquatus), 6000-12,000 ft.    Same regions, but at lower elevations.    The small bear of the southern Suliman    hills known as _mam_ is now considered a    variety of the black bear.      (_g_) Leopards:      1. Snow Leopard (Felis Uncia), 9000-15,000 ft.    Kashmir, Chamba, Bashahr.      2. Ordinary Leopard (Felis Pardus). Lower    hills.      SHOOTING IN HILLS    ~Shooting in Hills.~--The finest shooting in the north-west Himalaya is  probably to be got in Ladakh and Baltistan, but the trip is somewhat  expensive and requires more time than may be available. In many areas  licenses have to be obtained, and the conditions limit the number of  certain animals, and the size of heads, that may be shot. For example,  the permit in Chamba may allow the shooting of two red bear and two  _thar_, and when these have been got the sportsman must turn his  attention to black bear and _gural_. Any one contemplating a shooting  expedition in the Himalaya should get from one who has the necessary  experience very complete instructions as to weapons, tents, clothing,  stores, etc.      SPORT IN THE PLAINS    (_a_) ~Black Buck Shooting.~--To get a good idea of what shooting in the  plains is like Major Glasford's _Rifle and Romance in the Indian Jungle_  may be consulted. As regards larger game the favourite sport is black  buck shooting. A high velocity cordite rifle is dangerous to the country  people, and some rifle firing black powder should be used. It is well to  reach the home of the herd soon after sunrise while it is still in the  open, and not among the crops. There will usually be one old buck in  each herd. He himself is not watchful, but his does are, and the herd  gallops off with great leaps at the first scent of danger, the does  leading and their lord and master bringing up the rear. If by dint of  careful and patient stalking you get to some point of vantage, say 100  yards from the big buck, it is worth while to shoot. Even if the bullet  finds its mark the quarry may gallop 50 yards before it drops. Good  heads vary from 20\" to 24\" or even more.    [Illustration: Fig. 26. Black buck.]    (_b_) ~Small game in Plains.~--The cold weather shooting begins with the  advent of the quail in the end of September and ends when they reappear  among the ripening wheat in April. The duck arrive from the Central  Asian lakes in November and duck and snipe shooting lasts till February  in districts where there are _jhils_ and swampy land. For a decent shot  30 couple of snipe is a fair bag. To get duck the _jhil_ should be  visited at dawn and again in the evening, and it is well to post several  guns in favourable positions in the probable line of flight. 40 or 50  birds would be a good morning's bag. In drier tracts the bag will  consist of partridges and a hare or two, or, if the country is sandy,  some sand-grouse and perhaps a bustard.          CHAPTER IX    THE PEOPLE: NUMBERS, RACES, AND LANGUAGES      ~Growth of Population.~--It is probable that in the 64 years since  annexation the population of the Panjab has increased by from 40 to 50  per cent. The first reliable census was taken in 1881. The figures for  the four decennial enumerations are:      |-------------------------------------------------------------|    |     |                                  |          |         |    |     |              Panjab              |  N.W.F.  | Kashmir |    |Year |----------------------------------| Province |         |    |     | British   |  Native  |  Total    |          |         |    |     |           |  States  |           |          |         |    |-------------------------------------------------------------|    |1881 |17,274,597 |3,861,683 |21,136,280 |1,543,726 |         |    |1891 |19,009,368 |4,263,280 |23,272,648 |1,857,504 |2,543.952|    |1901 |20,330,337 |4,424,398 |24,754,735 |2,041,534 |2,905,578|    |1911 |19,974,956 |4,212,974 |24,187,730 |2,196,933 |3,158,126|    |-------------------------------------------------------------|    ~Incidence of Population in Panjab.~--The estimated numbers of independent  tribes dwelling within the British sphere of influence is 1,600,000. The  incidence of the population on the total area of the Panjab including  native States is 177 per square mile, which may be compared with 189 in  France and 287 in the British Isles. As the map shows, the density is  reduced by the large area of semi-desert country in the south-west and  by the mountainous tract in the north-east. The distribution of the  population is the exact opposite of that which prevails in Great  Britain. There are only 174 towns as compared with 44,400 villages, and  nearly nine-tenths of the people are to be found in the latter. Some of  the so-called towns are extremely small, and the average population per  town is but 14,800 souls. There are no large towns in the European  sense. The biggest, Delhi and Lahore, returned respectively 232,837 and  228,687 persons.    [Illustration: Fig. 27. Map showing density of population.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28. Map showing increase and decrease of  population.]    ~Growth stopped by Plague.~--The growth of the population between 1881 and  1891 amounted to 10 p.c. Plague, which has smitten the Panjab more  severely than any other province, appeared in 1896, and its effect was  seen in the lower rate of expansion between 1891 and 1901.  Notwithstanding great extensions of irrigation and cultivation in the  Rechna Doab the numbers declined by 2 p.c. between 1901 and 1911. In the  ten years from 1901 to 1910 in the British districts alone over two  million people died of plague and the death-rate was raised to 12 p.c.  above the normal. It actually exceeded the birth-rate by 2 p.c. Of the  total deaths in the decade nearly one in four was due to plague. The  part which has suffered most is the rich submontane tract east of the  Chenab, Lahore and Gujranwala, and some of the south-eastern districts.  A glance at the map will show how large the loss of population has been  there. It is by no means entirely due to plague. The submontane  districts were almost over-populated, and many of their people have  emigrated as colonists, tenants, and labourers to the waste tracts  brought under cultivation by the excavation of the Lower Chenab and  Jhelam canals. The districts which have received very marked additions  of population from this cause are Jhang (21 p.c.), Shahpur (30 p.c.), and  Lyallpur (45 p.c.). Deaths from plague have greatly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#16)"],[1,"POLLEN, OR BEE-BREAD.      This substance is gathered by the bees from the flowers, or blossoms,  and is used _for the nourishment of their young_. Repeated experiments  have proved that no brood can be raised in a hive, unless the bees are  supplied with it. It contains none of the elements of wax, but is rich  in what chemists call nitrogenous substances, which are not contained in  honey, and which furnish ample nourishment for the development of the  growing bee. Dr. Hunter dissected some immature bees, and found their  stomachs to contain farina, but not a particle of honey.    We are indebted to Huber for the discovery of the use made by the bees  of pollen. That it did not serve as food for the mature bees, was  evident from the fact that large supplies are often found in hives whose  inmates have starved to death. It was this fact which led the old  observers to conclude that it was gathered for the purpose of building  comb. After Huber had demonstrated that wax is secreted from an entirely  different substance, he was soon led to conjecture that the bee-bread  must be used for the nourishment of the embryo bees. By rigid  experiments he proved the truth of this supposition. Bees were confined  to their hive without any pollen, after being supplied with honey, eggs  and larvae. In a short time the young all perished. A fresh supply of  brood was given to them, with an ample allowance of pollen, and the  development of the larvae then proceeded in the natural way.    When a colony is actively engaged in carrying in this article, it may be  taken for granted that they have a fertile queen, and are busy in  breeding. On the contrary, if any colony is not gathering pollen when  others are, the queen is either dead, or diseased, and the hive should  at once be examined.    In the backward spring of 1852, I had an excellent opportunity of  testing the value of this substance. In one of my hives, was an  artificial swarm of the previous year. The hive was well protected,  being double, and the situation was warm. I opened it on the 5th of  February, and although the weather, until within a week of that time,  had been unusually cold, I found many of the cells filled with brood. On  the 23d, the combs were again examined, and found to contain, neither  eggs, brood, nor bee bread. The bees were then supplied with bee bread  taken from another hive: the next day, this was found to have been used  by them, and a large number of eggs had been deposited in the cells.  When this supply was exhausted, egg-laying ceased, and was again renewed  when more was furnished them.    During all the time of these experiments, the weather was unpromising,  and as the bees were unable to go out for water, they were supplied at  home with this important article.    Dzierzon is of opinion that the bees are able to furnish food for the  young, without the presence of pollen in the hive; although he admits  that they can do this only for a short time, and at a great expense of  vital energy; just as the strength of an animal nursing its young is  rapidly reduced, when for want of proper food, the very substance of  its own body as it were, is converted into milk. My experiments do not  corroborate this theory, but tend to confirm the views of Huber, and to  show the absolute necessity of pollen to the development of brood. The  same able contributor to Apiarian science, thinks that pollen is used by  the bees when they are engaged in comb-building; and that unless they  are well supplied with it, they cannot rapidly secrete wax, without very  severely taxing their strength. But as all the elements of wax are found  in honey, and none of them in pollen, this opinion does not seem to me,  to be entitled to much weight. That bees cannot live upon pollen without  any honey, is proved by the fact, that large stores of it are often  found, in hives whose occupants have died of starvation; that they can  live without it, is equally well known; but that the full grown bees  make some use of it in connection with honey, for their own nourishment,  I believe to be highly probable.    The bees prefer to gather _fresh_ bee-bread, even when there are large  accumulations of old stores in the cells. Hence, the great importance of  being able to make the _surplus_ of old colonies supply the _deficiency_  of young ones. (See No. 28, in the Chapter \"On the advantages which  ought to be found in an Improved Hive.\")    If both honey and pollen can be obtained from the same flower, then a  load of _each_ will be secured by the industrious insect. Of this, any  one may convince himself, who will dissect a few pollen gatherers at the  time when honey is plenty: he will generally find their honey-bags full.    The mode of gathering is very interesting. The body of the bee appears,  to the naked eye, to be covered with fine hairs; to these, when the bee  alights on a flower, the farina adheres. With her legs, she brushes it  off from her body, and packs it in two hollows or _baskets_, one on each  of her thighs: these baskets are surrounded by stouter hairs which hold  the load in its place.    When the bee returns with pollen, she often makes a singular, dancing or  vibratory motion, which attracts the attention of the other bees, who at  once nibble away from her thighs what they want for immediate use; the  rest she deposits in a cell for future need, where it is carefully  packed down, and often sealed over with wax.    It has been observed that a bee, in gathering pollen, always confines  herself to the same kind of flower on which she begins, even when that  is not so abundant as some others. Thus if you examine a ball of this  substance taken from her thigh, it is found to be of one uniform color  throughout: the load of one will be yellow, another red, and a third  brown; the color varying according to that of the plant from which it  was obtained. It is probable that the pollen of different kinds of  flowers would not pack so well together. It is certain that if they flew  from one species to another, there would be a much greater mixture of  different varieties than there now is, for they carry on their bodies  the pollen or fertilizing principle, and thus aid most powerfully in the  impregnation of plants.    This is one reason why it is so difficult to preserve pure, the  different varieties of the same vegetables whose flowers are sought by  the bee.    He must be blind indeed, who will not see, at every step in the natural  history of this insect, the plainest proofs of the wisdom of its  Creator.    I cannot resist the impression that the honey bee was made for the  especial service and instruction of man. At first the importance of its  products, when honey was the only natural sweet, served most powerfully  to attract his attention to its curious habits; and now since the  cultivation of the sugar cane has diminished the relative value of its  luscious sweets, the superior knowledge which has been obtained of its  instincts, is awakening an increasing enthusiasm in its cultivation.    Virgil in the fourth book of his Georgics, which is entirely devoted to  bees, speaks of them as having received a direct emanation from the  Divine Intelligence. And many modern Apiarians are almost disposed to  rank the bee for sagacity, as next in the scale of creation to man.    The importance of pollen to the nourishment of the brood, has long been  known, and of late, successful attempts have been made to furnish a  _substitute_. The bees in Dzierzon's Apiary were observed by him, early  in the spring before the time for procuring pollen, to bring rye meal to  their hives from a neighboring mill. It is now a common practice on the  continent of Europe, where bee keeping is extensively carried on, to  supply the bees, in early spring, with this article. Shallow troughs are  set in front of the Apiaries, which are filled, about two inches deep,  with _finely ground, dry, unbolted rye meal_. Thousands of bees resort  eagerly to them when the weather is favorable, roll themselves in the  meal, and return heavily laden to their hives. In fine, mild weather,  they labor at this work with astonishing industry; and seem decidedly to  prefer the meal to the _old_ pollen stored in their combs. By this  means, the bees are induced to commence breeding _early_, and rapidly  recruit their numbers. The feeding is continued till the bees cease to  carry away the meal; that is, until the natural supplies furnish them  with a preferable article. The average consumption of each colony is  about two pounds of meal!    At the last annual Apiarian Convention in Germany, a cultivator  recommended wheat flour as an excellent substitute for pollen. He says  that in February, 1852, he used it with the best results. The bees  _forsook the honey_ which had been set out for them, and engaged  actively in carrying in large quantities of the wheat flour, which was  placed about twenty paces in front of the hives.    The construction of my hives, permits the flour to be placed, at once,  where the bees can take it, without being compelled to waste their time  in going out for it, or to suffer for the want of it, when the weather  confines them at home.    The discovery of this substitute, removes a serious obstacle to the  successful culture of bees. In many districts, there is a great  abundance of honey for a few weeks in the season; and almost any number  of colonies, which are strong when the honey harvest commences, will, in  a good season, lay up sufficient stores for themselves, and a large  surplus for their owners. In many of these districts, however, the  supply of pollen is often so insufficient, that the new colonies of the  previous year are found destitute of this article in the spring; and  unless the season is early, and the weather unusually favorable, the  production of brood is most seriously interfered with; thus the colony  becomes strong too late to avail"]]]
