And, deep into the fur and skin and  flesh of his shoulder her furious teeth shore their way.    It would have been child's play for him to have shaken her off and to  have leaped to safety, alone, through the sash-less window.    Yet he stood where he was; his sorrowful eyes looking tenderly down  upon the maddened youngster who was tearing into him so ferociously.    And that was the picture the Master beheld; as he flung open the door  and blinked gaspingly through the smoke for the dog he had locked in.    Brought out of bed, on the jump, by Lad's unearthly wolf howl, he had  smelt the smoke and had run out to investigate. But, not until he  unbarred the tool-house door did he guess that Lady was not the burning  shack's only prisoner.    \"It'll be another six months before your wonderful coat grows out  again, Laddie dear,\" observed the Mistress, next day, as she renewed  the smelly wet cloths on Lad's burned and glass-cut body. \"Dr. Hopper  says so. But he says the rest of you will be as well as ever, inside of  a fortnight. And he says Lady will be well, before you will. But,  honestly, you'll never look as beautiful, again, to me, as you do this  very minute. He--he said you look like a scarecrow. But you don't. You  look like a--like a--a-What gorgeously splendid thing DOES he look  like, dear?\" she appealed to her husband.    \"He looks,\" replied the Master, after deep thought, \"he looks like LAD.  And that's about the highest praise I know how to give him;--or give to  anyone.\"        CHAPTER V. The Stowaway    There were but three collies on the Place, in those days. Lad; his  dainty gold-and-white mate, Lady; and their fluffy and fiery wisp of a  son, little Wolf.    When Wolf was a spoiled and obstreperous puppy of three months or so,  Lady was stricken with distemper and was taken to a veterinary  hospital. There, for something more than three months she was nursed  through the scourging malady and through the chorea and pneumonia which  are so prone to follow in distemper's dread wake.    Science amuses itself by cutting up and otherwise torturing helpless  dogs in the unholy name of vivisection. But Science has not yet  troubled itself to discover one certain cure or preventive for the  distemper which yearly robs thousands of homes of their loved canine  pets and guards. Apparently it is pleasanter for scientists to watch a  screaming dog writhe under the knife in a research laboratory than to  trouble about finding a way to abolish distemper; and thus of ridding  the dog world of its worst scourge.    This is a digression from our story. But perhaps it is worth your  remembering,--you who care about dogs.    Altogether, Lady was away from the Place for fifteen weeks.    And, in her absence, the unhappy Lad took upon himself the task of  turning little Wolf from a pest into something approaching a decent  canine citizen. It was no sinecure, this educating of the hot-tempered  and undisciplined youngster. But Lad brought to it an elephantine  patience and an uncannily wise brain. And, by the time Lady was brought  back, cured, the puppy had begun to show the results of his sire's  stern teachings.    Indeed, Lady's absence was the best thing that could have befallen  Wolf. For, otherwise, his training must needs have devolved upon the  Mistress and the Master. And no mere humans could have done the job  with such grimly gentle thoroughness as did Lad. Few dogs, except  pointers or setters or collies, will deign to educate their puppies to  the duties of life and of field and of house. But Lad had done the work  in a way that left little to be asked for.    When Lady came home, her flighty brain seemed to have forgotten the  fact that young Wolf was her once-adored son. Of her earlier capricious  devotion to him, no trace remained. She sniffed in stand-offish inquiry  at him; as at a stranger. And the scatterbrain pup remembered her no  better than she remembered him. There is a wide gulf in intelligence  between a three-month puppy and one six months old.    Yet,--perhaps because they were both excitable and mischievous and  loved romping,--and because each was a novelty to the other--mother and  son quickly formed a new friendship. From the more sedate and  discipline-enforcing Lad, the youngster turned eagerly to chum-ship  with this flighty gold-white stranger. And Lady, for similar reason,  seemed to find ten times as much congeniality and fun in romping with  Wolf as in playing with the less galvanically agile Lad.    In brief, Lady and little Wolf became inseparable companions;--this to  the semi-exclusion of Lad.    The great collie did not resent this exclusion; nor did he try to  regain his fast-slipping hold on Wolf's affections. Yet, in fashion  that was more pathetic than ludicrous, he sought to win back Lady's  waning affection. A bit clumsily, he tried to romp and gambol with her,  as did Wolf. He tried to interest her, as of yore, in following his  lead in break-neck forest gallops after rabbits or in gloriously  exhilarating swims in the fire-blue lake at the foot of the lawn. To  the pityingly on-looking Mistress and Master, he seemed like some  general or statesman seeking to unbend in the games and chatter of a  party of high school boys and girls.    But it was no use.    True, in the cross-country runs or the swirling charges after rabbits,  neither Lady nor Wolf could keep up with Lad's flying stride. And a  long swim, which scarce breathed Lad, would exhaust either or both of  them.    But, they were young; and he was middle-aged. And, as in human  relationships, that one sentence told the whole tragic story.    As well expect a couple of flyaway children to give up a game of tag in  order to listen to the solemn discourse of an elderly uncle; as to make  the fun-loving Lady and Wolf widen their selfish comradeship to include  in it the steadier and older and infinitely wiser Lad.    Perforce, Lad was thrown more and more on the society of the Mistress  and the Master. And, in their friendship, he was happy;--until he would  chance to see his mate and his little son playing in wild ecstasy with  a stick or ball, and would frisk bulkily over to join them. In a bare  second or two, the demeanor of both showed him just what a grossly  unwelcome interloper he was.    Whereat, after a wistfully miserable glance from one to the other of  the exclusive pair, Lad would trot slowly back to his human deities;  and, with a queerly sobbing little sigh, he would curl up at the  Mistress's feet.    \"It's a shame, Laddie!\" declared the Mistress, at one such time. \"It's  a SHAME! Why, you are worth a million of those crazy playdogs! You're a  million times wiser and beautifuller and more lovable. Why do you  bother with them? Master and I are ever so much better company for you;  and we love to have you with us. Stay right here, and forget them.\"    Lad, perhaps, understood the actual meaning of one word in ten of the  advice. But he understood and loved the Mistress's sweet voice and the  caress of her cool little hand; and the sympathy in her tone. It all  meant much to Laddie. Very much indeed. And he laid his mighty head  against her knee; happy in the comfort of touch and voice.    Nevertheless, that wistful glint was ever lurking in his deep-set eyes,  nowadays. And his gayly trumpeting bark rang out less often and less  jubilantly than of old. He took to moping. And he spent more time than  before in his beloved \"cave,\" under the music-room piano.    Moping and solitude are no more beneficial to dogs than to humans. The  Master racked his brain for some way of bringing the splendid collie  back to his olden spirits.    Luck, or fate, took the matter out of his hands.    The Mistress and the Master were invited to spend a week with some  friends whose house stood in an ultra-restricted residential park, high  up in the Catskills. By leaving the Place at sunrise, they could reach  the Park, by motor, in time for afternoon tea.    At dawn, the car was brought to the door. Its tonneau was piled with  luggage; and all was ready for a start as soon as the unappetizingly  early breakfast could be swallowed.    Wolf and Lady, after following the car from the garage to the door,  wearied of the uninspiring wait; and set forth at a hand-gallop for the  woods. There, at dawning, the dew would lie heavy. And wet ground ever  holds scent better than does dry. It would be easy to pick up and  follow rabbit trails, through the damp.    Lad made as though to follow them. He ran out of the house and half-way  up the drive in pursuit of their flashing gold-and-white flight.  Neither turned a head at sound of his following steps. Neither  slackened pace to include him in the hunt.    Always abnormally sensitive, the big collie noted this aloofness. And  he came to an irresolute halt. For a moment, he stared after the two  vanishing runaways; his plumed tail swaying ever so little, in  groundless expectation of an invitingly glance or yelp from Lady. Then,  tail and crest adroop, he turned slowly back toward the house.    From puppyhood, an odd trait of Lad's had caused amusement at the  Place. Whenever he was unhappy or considered himself ill-treated, it  was his way to hunt for something wherewith he might comfort himself.  For instance, as a pup, a scolding for some petty misdeed would send  him in search of his cherished flannel doll or his squeaking ball. In  later years, the car had taken the place of these babyhood comforters.    Lad cared more for motoring than for any other amusement. In moments of  stress he sometimes ran to the garage and curled himself up in the  tonneau; as though in hope someone might take pity on his unhappiness  and give him a drive. And, usually, somebody did.    Now, turning back, rebuffed, from the forest gallop, he caught sight of  the car. Not in the garage, either; but at the front door; where its  presence could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#16)"],[1,"however peaceful and free from danger the country might seem, the black  always marched about shouldering his spear and watching that this was  done, while after noting how careful the man was, the doctor gave him a  few words of praise and left these precautions to him, while these  safeguards always included the collecting of a supply of wood sufficient  to keep up a good blazing fire till morning.    \"I suppose this is all right,\" said Mark, who was extra tired and had  several times yawned widely after partaking of an ample supper, \"but all  these days we have been travelling farther and farther into the depth of  the country we haven't seen a single big beast, let alone a lion.\"    \"Only the one you shot at, Mark,\" said his cousin.    \"You don't seem as if you could forget about my mistake, Dean,\" said  Mark peevishly.  \"Here, I think I shall lie down and go to sleep.\"    \"And forget all about its being your turn to take first watch?\" said the  doctor, smiling.    \"What, again?\" cried the boy peevishly, \"Oh, how soon the nights do come  round!  Well, I don't have to go on duty for hours yet, so I shall have  my nap first.  But I say, doctor, I thought that we should always be  seeing lions and elephants and giraffes, besides rhinoceroses, which  would come charging at the waggons whenever they saw them.\"    \"I daresay you did,\" said the doctor quietly.    \"And here we haven't seen one--nothing but those little--well, some of  them were big--bucks.\"    \"Why, we saw a drove of zebras the other day.\"    \"Yes, we did see them,\" replied Mark.  \"But I wanted to have a shot at  an elephant or a giraffe.\"    \"Yes; I suppose you expected to find South Africa a sort of  over-abundant Zoological Gardens.\"    \"No, I didn't,\" said Mark; \"but I did expect that as soon as we began  burning fires to keep off the wild beasts, there would be some to keep  off.\"    \"Patience, my dear boy; patience.  We have only come a little way into  the country as yet.\"    \"A little way!\" cried Mark.  \"Why, you forget, doctor, how many weary  days we have been tramping since we left the soldiers' station.\"    \"Oh, no, I do not, my dear boy.  It is a very little way compared with  the vastness of this great solid continent.  We have not seen a lion  yet, but that does not show that we may not have been passing through  open country where they are abundant; and very likely if we had omitted  to start this blazing fire to-night we might have had a visit from  several.\"    \"I vote, then,\" cried Mark, whose sleepy fit seemed to have passed over,  \"that we put the fire out with a few buckets of water and then sit up  and watch.\"    \"No,\" said Sir James drowsily; \"I forbid it.  You are not going to allow  that, doctor?\"    \"Certainly not, sir; and even if I felt so disposed the black would not  allow it.  You must be patient, Mark.  I dare say we shall meet with  more wild beasts than we care for before long, and wild men too.\"    \"I am ready,\" said Mark, rather bumptiously; \"but I am disappointed, all  the same.\"    \"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"no doubt you are; but you must curb your  impatience till we reach the part of the country where the lions are.  I  thought you were going to have your nap.\"    \"No,\" said Mark; \"Dean and I are going to have a chat with the men.  Dance says he wouldn't have believed there could have been so many `come  backs' in all the world--I say, what's that?\" he cried.  \"That wasn't a  lion?\"    \"No,\" said the doctor, for a long, low, dismal and penetrating howl had  gone out upon the night.    \"What is it, then?  There it goes again.\"    \"I form my own idea of what it is,\" said the doctor.  \"You two can go  and tell the men to throw some more wood on the fire.\"    He had hardly spoken when the low and doleful howl rang out again from  the distance, and the fire blazed up under the influence of an armful of  dead boughs which the Hottentot and the black foreloper had just thrown  on, the clear, bright flame showing out the big, heavy figure of Buck  Denham and lighting up his face as he turned round to tell the men to  bring up more wood for the night supply.    The boys sprang up from where they were seated, and hurried round to the  other side of the blazing heap where their men had gathered together to  sit and have their evening smoke.    \"Hear that howling?\" cried Mark.  \"You, Pete--Bob--\"    \"Yes, sir; we couldn't help it,\" said the latter.  \"I was asking Buck  Denham what it was, thinking it was one of them great tom cats; but he  says it's only a hy-he--something.\"    \"Hyhaena, my lad--hyhaena.\"    \"Yes, that's it.  Well, it made noise enough for t'other, didn't it?\"    \"Made noise enough for t'other!\" growled the driver.  \"You wait till you  hear the real thing, and you won't ask questions again like that.\"    Dance took his pipe out of his mouth and opened his eyes, for he too had  grown drowsy in the warmth of the fire, after his long day's tramp.    \"I 'eerd it too, and thought it must be a big howl a-howling.  You have  got howls out here, haven't you, mate?\"    \"Oh, yes; plenty.  But that's what I said.\"    The big driver having noted that the men had brought up a plentiful  supply of wood sufficient to keep up the beast-scaring beacon, subsided  heavily in the full light of the fire and began to fill his pipe.    \"Now you two,\" he said to the Hottentot and the foreloper, \"just take a  quiet walk round the bullocks, and then you can come back and smoke your  pipe of peace.\"    The Hottentot's voice sounded very unpleasant and very clicky as he  replied sharply, and though it was almost unintelligible Mark made out  from it and the driver's answers that Dunn Brown was already performing  that duty.    \"Oh,\" said Buck, \"then you needn't go.  That will be all right.  Well,  Illaka, aren't you coming to sit down?\"  For the boys suddenly noticed  the black shadowy figure of the guide glide into the firelight, his  appearance being emphasised by a flash where the flame played upon the  polished leaf-shaped blade of his spear.    The man nodded, shook his head, and disappeared again.    \"What sort of fish do you think there are out in the river here?\" asked  Bob Bacon.    \"I don't know their names,\" said Buck Denham quietly, as he went on  filling his pipe very slowly; and the two boys sat down one on either  side, pricking up their ears at the words \"river\" and \"fish.\"    The big driver leaned forward, drew out an incandescent piece of wood  and quite ceremoniously held it to the bowl of his pipe.    \"I don't think you will find any trout,\" he said, \"like you have at  home, but there's plenty of fish there, I should say, just as there is  lower down near Illakaree, and up here I should reckon there's plenty to  fish for.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Mark eagerly, as he glanced round at the picturesque group  seated in the full blaze of the fire, while the reflections played upon  the dark edge of the forest, piercing the great overhanging branches  from among which a few startled birds dashed out, winged their way round  the circle of light and disappeared again.    \"Look, Dean; isn't it beautiful now!\"    \"Thought you wanted to go to sleep,\" said his cousin.    \"Not I!  I leave that to you.\"    \"Yes,\" continued the big driver, repeating his words, \"and I should say  there's plenty up here to fish for.\"    \"I say, Buck, are there so many blacks about here, then?\"    \"Sometimes, sir.\"    \"And do they go fishing?\"    \"No, sir; they may do, but I don't know as I ever saw a black go  fishing.  You've been to 'Stralia, Dan; do the black fellows out there  fish much?\"    \"Much?\" said Dan, showing his white teeth.  \"Yes, and hunt and knock the  big kangaroos over with their nulla-nullas and boomerangs.  Wittles are  precious scarce there, and they have had a hard time of it to get enough  grub, and I suppose that's why they pick holes in the softy wood trees  to get the big fat grubs out of them.\"    \"Ugh!  Horrid!\" said Dean.    \"No, sir,\" said Dean, smiling.  \"It don't sound nice, but I know a  little about cooking, and when them 'Stralian grubs are nicely cooked  over the fire they are not to be sneezed at.  There's another thing too  that's very nice eating, baked or roasted, and that's a locus', and I  shouldn't wonder if you could find them out here, for they come in  clouds up in the north and eat everything they find.\"    \"Well, don't cook any for us, Dan,\" said Mark.    \"There's no need, sir, with such a good supply of venison, as you gents  call it, and game birds.\"    \"But I should like you to try your hand with the frying-pan and some  fish.\"    \"You catch the fish, Mr Mark, sir, and leave it to me, and I'll promise  to fry it to rights, egged and crumbed and all.\"    \"What!\" cried Dean.    \"Well, no, that arn't right, sir.  Allers speak the truth, Dan, my boy,  my grandmother used to say; and I will if I can.  I could clean and  scale and egg the fish to rights.  We can get plenty of them comebacks'  eggs, but the crumbing of them would rather bother me, and I should have  to do it with mealie flour.\"    There was a short silence as the men sat smoking, and then Mark broke  out with, \"We will have a try for some fish; but who is it does the  fishing up here, then, Buck?\"    The big driver chuckled, and his eyes twinkled in the firelight.    \"The whoppers, sir.\"    \"The whoppers!\"    \"Yes, sir; the crocs.  I daresay if you went down by the river and  listened just at daybreak you would hear them at it, flapping the river  with their tails to stun the fish.\"    \"But that wouldn't stun the fish,\" cried Dean.  \"Oh, come, I say, what a  traveller's tale!\"  And Mark laughed as if agreeing with his cousin.    \"Well, it may be a traveller's tale, sir, but if you was there you'd see  the fish come to the top upside down, I mean, white side up'ards, and  the crocs shovelling them down as fast as you like.  That's all I know  about it.\"    \"But is that true, Buck?\"    \"Yes, sir; true enough, for I have seen it.  I wouldn't "]]]
