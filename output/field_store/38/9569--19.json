Lilian had not  promised more than she could perform, and her customers were  satisfied. In a short time she found herself with a regular and  growing business on her hands, for new customers were gradually added  and always came to stay.    People who gave parties found it very convenient to follow Mrs.  Saunders's example and order their supplies from Lilian. She had a  very busy winter and, of course, it was not all plain sailing. She had  many difficulties to contend with. Sometimes days came on which  everything seemed to go wrong--when the stove smoked or the oven  wouldn't heat properly, when cakes fell flat and bread was sour and  pies behaved as only totally depraved pies can, when she burned her  fingers and felt like giving up in despair.    Then, again, she found herself cut by several of her old  acquaintances. But she was too sensible to worry much over this. The  friends really worth having were still hers, her mother's face had  lost its look of care, and her business was prospering. She was  hopeful and wide awake, kept her wits about her and looked out for  hints, and learned to laugh over her failures.    During the winter she and her mother had managed to do most of the  work themselves, hiring little Mary Robinson next door on especially  busy days, and now and then calling in the assistance of Jimmy Bowen  and his hand sled to carry orders to customers. But when spring came  Lilian prepared to open up her summer campaign on a much larger scale.  Mary Robinson was hired for the season, and John Perkins was engaged  to act as carrier with his express wagon. A summer kitchen was boarded  in in the backyard, and a new range bought; Lilian began operations  with a striking advertisement in the Willington _News_ and an  attractive circular sent around to all her patrons. Picnics and summer  weddings were frequent. In bread and rolls her trade was brisk and  constant. She also took orders for pickles, preserves, and jellies,  and this became such a flourishing branch that a second assistant had  to be hired.    It was a cardinal rule with Lilian never to send out any article that  was not up to her standard. She bore the loss of her failures, and  sometimes stayed up half of the night to fill an order on time.  \"Prompt and perfect\" was her motto.    The long hot summer days were very trying, and sometimes she got very  tired of it all. But when on the anniversary of her first venture she  made up her accounts she was well pleased. To be sure, she had not  made a fortune; but she had paid all their expenses, had a hundred  dollars clear, and had laid the solid foundations of a profitable  business.    \"Mother,\" she said jubilantly, as she wiped a dab of flour from her  nose and proceeded to concoct the icing for Blanche Remington's  wedding cake, \"don't you think my business venture has been a decided  success?\"    Mrs. Mitchell surveyed her busy daughter with a motherly smile. \"Yes,  I think it has,\" she said.          Miriam's Lover      I had been reading a ghost story to Mrs. Sefton, and I laid it down at  the end with a little shrug of contempt.    \"What utter nonsense!\" I said.    Mrs. Sefton nodded abstractedly above her fancywork.    \"That is. It is a very commonplace story indeed. I don't believe the  spirits of the departed trouble themselves to revisit the glimpses of  the moon for the purpose of frightening honest mortals--or even for  the sake of hanging around the favourite haunts of their existence in  the flesh. If they ever appear, it must be for a better reason than  that.\"    \"You don't surely think that they ever do appear?\" I said  incredulously.    \"We have no proof that they do not, my dear.\"    \"Surely, Mary,\" I exclaimed, \"you don't mean to say that you believe  people ever do or can see spirits--ghosts, as the word goes?\"    \"I didn't say I believed it. I never saw anything of the sort. I  neither believe nor disbelieve. But you know queer things do happen at  times--things you can't account for. At least, people who you know  wouldn't lie say so. Of course, they may be mistaken. And I don't  think that everybody can see spirits either, provided they are to be  seen. It requires people of a certain organization--with a spiritual  eye, as it were. We haven't all got that--in fact, I think very few of  us have. I dare say you think I'm talking nonsense.\"    \"Well, yes, I think you are. You really surprise me, Mary. I always  thought you the least likely person in the world to take up with such  ideas. Something must have come under your observation to develop such  theories in your practical head. Tell me what it was.\"    \"To what purpose? You would remain as sceptical as ever.\"    \"Possibly not. Try me; I may be convinced.\"    \"No,\" returned Mrs. Sefton calmly. \"Nobody ever is convinced by  hearsay. When a person has once seen a spirit--or thinks he has--he  thenceforth believes it. And when somebody else is intimately  associated with that person and knows all the circumstances--well, he  admits the possibility, at least. That is my position. But by the time  it gets to the third person--the outsider--it loses power. Besides, in  this particular instance the story isn't very exciting. But then--it's  true.\"    \"You have excited my curiosity. You must tell me the story.\"    \"Well, first tell me what you think of this. Suppose two people, both  sensitively organized individuals, loved each other with a love  stronger than life. If they were apart, do you think it might be  possible for their souls to communicate with each other in some  inexplicable way? And if anything happened to one, don't you think  that that one could and would let the spirit of the other know?\"    \"You're getting into too deep waters for me, Mary,\" I said, shaking my  head. \"I'm not an authority on telepathy, or whatever you call it. But  I've no belief in such theories. In fact, I think they are all  nonsense. I'm sure you must think so too in your rational moments.\"    \"I dare say it is all nonsense,\" said Mrs. Sefton slowly, \"but if you  had lived a whole year in the same house with Miriam Gordon, you would  have been tainted too. Not that she had 'theories'--at least, she  never aired them if she had. But there was simply something about the  girl herself that gave a person strange impressions. When I first met  her I had the most uncanny feeling that she was all spirit--soul--what  you will! no flesh, anyhow. That feeling wore off after a while, but  she never seemed like other people to me.    \"She was Mr. Sefton's niece. Her father had died when she was a child.  When Miriam was twenty her mother had married a second time and went  to Europe with her husband. Miriam came to live with us while they  were away. Upon their return she was herself to be married.    \"I had never seen Miriam before. Her arrival was unexpected, and I was  absent from home when she came. I returned in the evening, and when I  saw her first she was standing under the chandelier in the drawing  room. Talk about spirits! For five seconds I thought I had seen one.    \"Miriam was a beauty. I had known that before, though I think I  hardly expected to see such wonderful loveliness. She was tall and  extremely graceful, dark--at least her hair was dark, but her skin was  wonderfully fair and clear. Her hair was gathered away from her face,  and she had a high, pure, white forehead, and the straightest, finest,  blackest brows. Her face was oval, with very large and dark eyes.    \"I soon realized that Miriam was in some mysterious fashion different  from other people. I think everyone who met her felt the same way. Yet  it was a feeling hard to define. For my own part I simply felt as if  she belonged to another world, and that part of the time she--her  soul, you know--was back there again.    \"You must not suppose that Miriam was a disagreeable person to have in  the house. On the contrary, it was the very reverse. Everybody liked  her. She was one of the sweetest, most winsome girls I ever knew, and  I soon grew to love her dearly. As for what Dick called her 'little  queernesses'--well, we got used to them in time.    \"Miriam was engaged, as I have told you, to a young Harvard man named  Sidney Claxton. I knew she loved him very deeply. When she showed me  his photograph, I liked his appearance and said so. Then I made some  teasing remark about her love-letters--just for a joke, you know.  Miriam looked at me with an odd little smile and said quickly:    \"'Sidney and I never write to each other.'    \"'Why, Miriam!' I exclaimed in astonishment. 'Do you mean to tell me  you never hear from him at all?'    \"'No, I did not say that. I hear from him every day--every hour. We  do not need to write letters. There are better means of communication  between two souls that are in perfect accord with each other.'    \"'Miriam, you uncanny creature, what do you mean?' I asked.    \"But Miriam only gave another queer smile and made no answer at all.  Whatever her beliefs or theories were, she would never discuss them.    \"She had a habit of dropping into abstracted reveries at any time or  place. No matter where she was, this, whatever it was, would come over  her. She would sit there, perhaps in the centre of a gay crowd, and  gaze right out into space, not hearing or seeing a single thing that  went on around her.    \"I remember one day in particular; we were sewing in my room. I looked  up and saw that Miriam's work had dropped on her knee and she was  leaning forward, her lips apart, her eyes gazing upward with an  unearthly expression.    \"'Don't look like that, Miriam!' I said, with a little shiver. 'You  seem to be looking at something a thousand miles away!'    \"Miriam came out of her trance or reverie and said, with a little  laugh:    \"'How do you know but that I was?'    \"She bent her head for a minute or two. Then she lifted it again and  looked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#16)"],[1,"aback by her coolness that he asked almost meekly what was her reason  for doing such a fool trick.    \"Because he turned John Osborne out of house and home,\" returned Nan  composedly. \"If he hadn't done that there is no telling what might  have happened. I might even have married him, because I liked him very  well and it would have pleased you. At any rate, I wouldn't have  married John when you were against him. Now I mean to.\"    Old Abe stormed furiously at this, but Nan kept so provokingly cool  that he was conscious of wasting breath. He went off in a rage, but  Nan did not feel particularly anxious now that the announcement was  over. He would cool down, she knew. John Osborne worried her more. She  didn't see clearly how she was to marry him unless he asked her, and  he had studiously avoided her since the foreclosure.    But Nan did not mean to be baffled or to let her lover slip through  her fingers for want of a little courage. She was not old Abe  Stewart's daughter for nothing.    One day Ned Bennett dropped in and said that John Osborne would start  for the west in three days. That evening Nan went up to her room and  dressed herself in the prettiest dress she owned, combed her hair  around her sparkling face in bewitching curls, pinned a cluster of  apple blossoms at her belt, and, thus equipped, marched down in the  golden sunset light to the Mill Creek Bridge. John Osborne, on his  return from Thornhope half an hour later, found her there, leaning  over the rail among the willows.    Nan started in well-assumed surprise and then asked him why he had not  been to see her. John blushed--stammered--didn't know--had been busy.  Nan cut short his halting excuses by demanding to know if he were  really going away, and what he intended to do.    \"I'll go out on the prairies and take up a claim,\" said Osborne  sturdily. \"Begin life over again free of debt. It'll be hard work, but  I'm not afraid of that. I will succeed if it takes me years.\"    They walked on in silence. Nan came to the conclusion that Osborne  meant to hold his peace.    \"John,\" she said tremulously, \"won't--won't you find it very lonely  out there?\"    \"Of course--I expect that. I shall have to get used to it.\"    Nan grew nervous. Proposing to a man was really very dreadful.    \"Wouldn't it be--nicer for you\"--she faltered--\"that is--it wouldn't  be so lonely for you--would it--if--if you had me out there with you?\"    John Osborne stopped squarely in the dusty road and looked at her.  \"Nan!\" he exclaimed.    \"Oh, if you can't take a hint!\" said Nan in despair.    It was all of an hour later that a man drove past them as they  loitered up the hill road in the twilight. It was Bryan Lee; he had  taken from Osborne his house and land, but he had not been able to  take Nan Stewart, after all.          Natty of Blue Point      Natty Miller strolled down to the wharf where Bliss Ford was tying up  the _Cockawee_. Bliss was scowling darkly at the boat, a trim new one,  painted white, whose furled sails seemed unaccountably wet and whose  glistening interior likewise dripped with moisture. A group of  fishermen on the wharf were shaking their heads sagely as Natty drew  near.    \"Might as well split her up for kindlings, Bliss,\" said Jake McLaren.  \"You'll never get men to sail in her. It passed the first time, seeing  as only young Johnson was skipper, but when a boat turns turtle with  Captain Frank in command, there's something serious wrong with her.\"    \"What's up?\" asked Natty.    \"The _Cockawee_ upset out in the bay again this morning,\" answered  Will Scott. \"That's the second time. The _Grey Gull_ picked up the men  and towed her in. It's no use trying to sail her. Lobstermen ain't  going to risk their lives in a boat like that. How's things over at  Blue Point, Natty?\"    \"Pretty well,\" responded Natty laconically. Natty never wasted words.  He had not talked a great deal in his fourteen years of life, but he  was much given to thinking. He was rather undersized and insignificant  looking, but there were a few boys of his own age on the mainland who  knew that Natty had muscles.    \"Has Everett heard anything from Ottawa about the lighthouse business  yet?\" asked Will.    Natty shook his head.    \"Think he's any chance of getting the app'intment?\" queried Adam  Lewis.    \"Not the ghost of a chance,\" said Cooper Creasy decidedly. \"He's on  the wrong side of politics, that's what. Er rather his father was. A  Tory's son ain't going to get an app'intment from a Lib'ral  government, that's what.\"    \"Mr. Barr says that Everett is too young to be trusted in such a  responsible position,\" quoted Natty gravely.    Cooper shrugged his shoulders.    \"Mebbe--mebbe. Eighteen is kind of green, but everybody knows that  Ev's been the real lighthouse keeper for two years, since your father  took sick. Irving Elliott wants that light--has wanted it for  years--and he's a pretty strong pull at headquarters, that's what.  Barr owes him something for years of hard work at elections. I ain't  saying anything against Elliott, either. He's a good man, but your  father's son ought to have that light as sure as he won't get it,  that's what.\"    \"Any of you going to take in the sports tomorrow down at Summerside?\"  asked Will Scott, in order to switch Cooper away from politics, which  were apt to excite him.    \"I'm going, for one,\" said Adam. \"There's to be a yacht race atween  the Summerside and Charlottetown boat clubs. Yes, I am going. Give you  a chance down to the station, Natty, if you want one.\"    Natty shook his head.    \"Not going,\" he said briefly.    \"You should celebrate Victoria Day,\" said Adam, patriotically.  \"'Twenty-fourth o' May's the Queen's birthday, Ef we don't get a  holiday we'll all run away,' as we used to say at school. The good old  Queen is dead, but the day's been app'inted a national holiday in  honour of her memory and you should celebrate it becoming, Natty-boy.\"    \"Ev and I can't both go, and he's going,\" explained Natty. \"Prue and  I'll stay home to light up. Must be getting back now. Looks squally.\"    \"I misdoubt if we'll have Queen's weather tomorrow,\" said Cooper,  squinting critically at the sky. \"Looks like a northeast blow, that's  what. There goes Bliss, striding off and looking pretty mad. The  _Cockawee's_ a dead loss to him, that's what. Nat's off--he knows how  to handle a boat middling well, too. Pity he's such a puny youngster.  Not much to him, I reckon.\"    Natty had cast loose in his boat, the _Merry Maid_, and hoisted his  sail. In a few minutes he was skimming gaily down the bay. The wind  was fair and piping and the _Merry Maid_ went like a bird. Natty, at  the rudder, steered for Blue Point Island, a reflective frown on his  face. He was feeling in no mood for Victoria Day sports. In a very  short time he and Ev and Prue must leave Blue Point lighthouse, where  they had lived all their lives. To Natty it seemed as if the end of  all things would come then. Where would life be worth living away from  lonely, windy Blue Point Island?    David Miller had died the preceding winter after a long illness. He  had been lighthouse keeper at Blue Point for thirty years. His three  children had been born and brought up there, and there, four years  ago, the mother had died. But womanly little Prue had taken her place  well, and the boys were devoted to their sister. When their father  died, Everett had applied for the position of lighthouse keeper. The  matter was not yet publicly decided, but old Cooper Creasy had sized  the situation up accurately. The Millers had no real hope that Everett  would be appointed.    Victoria Day, while not absolutely stormy, proved to be rather  unpleasant. A choppy northeast wind blew up the bay, and the water was  rough enough. The sky was overcast with clouds, and the May air was  raw and chilly. At Blue Point the Millers were early astir, for if  Everett wanted to sail over to the mainland in time to catch the  excursion train, no morning naps were permissible. He was going alone.  Since only one of the boys could go, Natty had insisted that it should  be Everett, and Prue had elected to stay home with Natty. Prue had  small heart for Victoria Day that year. She did not feel even a thrill  of enthusiasm when Natty hoisted a flag and wreathed the Queen's  picture with creeping spruce. Prue felt as badly about leaving Blue  Point Island as the boys did.    The day passed slowly. In the afternoon the wind fell away to a dead  calm, but there was still a heavy swell on, and shortly before sunset  a fog came creeping up from the east and spread over the bay and  islands, so thick and white that Prue and Natty could not even see  Little Bear Island on the right.    \"I'm glad Everett isn't coming back tonight,\" said Prue. \"He could  never find his way cross the harbour in that fog.\"    \"Isn't it thick, though,\" said Natty. \"The light won't show far  tonight.\"    At sunset they lighted the great lamps and then settled down to an  evening of reading. But it was not long before Natty looked up from  his book to say, \"Hello, Prue, what was that? Thought I heard a  noise.\"    \"So did I,\" said Prue. \"I sounded like someone calling.\"    They hurried to the door, which looked out on the harbour. The night,  owing to the fog, was dark with a darkness that seemed almost  tangible. From somewhere out of that darkness came a muffled shouting,  like that of a person in distress.    \"Prue, there's somebody in trouble out there!\" exclaimed Natty.    \"Oh, it's surely never Ev!\" cried Prue.    Natty shook his head.    \"Don't think so. Ev had no intention of coming back tonight. Get that  lantern, Prue. I must go and see what and who it is.\"    \"Oh, Natty, you mustn't,\" cried Prue in distress. \"There's a heavy  swell on yet--and the fog--oh, if you get lost--\"    \"I'll not get lost, and I must go, Prue. Maybe somebody is drowning  out there. It's not Ev, of course, but suppose it were!"]]]
