No doubt semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton  records (2/25. 'Essays on Natural History' 2nd series page 161.) the case  of a mare which produced successively three foals without tails; so that a  tailless race might have been formed like the tailless races of dogs and  cats. A Russian breed of horses is said to have curled hair, and Azara  (2/26. 'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 page 333. Dr. Canfield informs me  that a breed with curly hair was formed by selection at Los Angeles in  North America.) relates that in Paraguay horses are occasionally born, but  are generally destroyed, with hair like that on the head of a negro; and  this peculiarity is transmitted even to half-breeds: it is a curious case  of correlation that such horses have short manes and tails, and their hoofs  are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.    It is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection of  qualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the formation of  the several breeds of the horse. Look at a dray-horse, and see how well  adapted he is to draw heavy weights, and how unlike in appearance to any  allied wild animal. The English race-horse is known to be derived from the  commingled blood of Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection, which was  carried on during very early times in England (2/27. See the evidence on  this head in 'Land and Water' May 2, 1868.), together with training, have  made him a very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a writer in  India, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now, \"looking at  our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that they were the  result of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?\" The improvement is  so marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup \"the first descendants of  Arabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are allowed a discount of 18 pounds  weight; and when both parents are of these countries a discount of 36  pounds (2/28. Prof. Low 'Domesticated Animals' page 546. With respect to  the writer in India see 'India Sporting Review' volume 2 page 181. As  Lawrence has remarked ('The Horse' page 9), \"perhaps no instance has ever  occurred of a three-part bred horse (i.e. a horse, one of whose  grandparents was of impure blood) saving his distance in running two miles  with thoroughbred racers.\" Some few instances are on record of seven-eights  racers having been successful.) It is notorious that the Arabs have long  been as careful about the pedigree of their horses as we are, and this  implies great and continued care in breeding. Seeing what has been done in  England by careful breeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have  produced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of  their horses? But we may go much farther back in time, for in the Bible we  hear of studs carefully kept for breeding, and of horses imported at high  prices from various countries. (2/29. Prof. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome  2 page 144 has collected many facts on this head. For instance Solomon (1  Kings x. 28) bought horses in Egypt at a high price.) We may therefore  conclude that, whether or not the various existing breeds of the horse have  proceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks, yet that a great amount of  change has resulted from the direct action of the conditions of life, and  probably a still greater amount from the long-continued selection by man of  slight individual differences.    With several domesticated quadrupeds and birds, certain coloured marks are  either strongly inherited or tend to reappear after having been lost for a  long time. As this subject will hereafter be seen to be of importance, I  will give a full account of the colouring of horses. All English breeds,  however unlike in size and appearance, and several of those in India and  the Malay archipelago, present a similar range and diversity of colour. The  English race-horse, however, is said (2/30. 'The Field' July 13, 1861 page  42.) never to be dun-coloured; but as dun and cream-coloured horses are  considered by the Arabs as worthless, \"and fit only for Jews to ride\"  (2/31. E. Vernon Harcourt 'Sporting in Algeria' page 26.), these tints may  have been removed by long-continued selection. Horses of every colour, and  of such widely different kinds as dray-horses, cobs, and ponies, are all  occasionally dappled (2/32. I state this from my own observations made  during several years on the colours of horses. I have seen cream-coloured,  light-dun and mouse-dun horses dappled, which I mention because it has been  stated (Martin 'History of the Horse' page 134) that duns are never  dappled. Martin (page 205) refers to dappled asses. In the 'Farrier'  (London 1828 pages 453, 455) there are some good remarks on the dappling of  horses; and likewise in Col. Hamilton Smith on 'The Horse.'), in the same  manner as is so conspicuous with grey horses. This fact does not throw any  clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse, but is a case of  analogous variation, for even asses are sometimes dappled, and I have seen,  in the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its  hinder quarters. By the expression analogous variation (and it is one that  I shall often have occasion to use) I mean a variation occurring in a  species or variety which resembles a normal character in another and  distinct species or variety. Analogous variations may arise, as will be  explained in a future chapter, from two or more forms with a similar  constitution having been exposed to similar conditions,--or from one of two  forms having reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the  other form from their common progenitor,--or from both forms having  reverted to the same ancestral character. We shall immediately see that  horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over a large part  of their bodies; and as we know that in the varieties of the domestic cat  and in several feline species stripes readily pass into spots and cloudy  marks--even the cubs of the uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with dark  marks on a lighter ground--we may suspect that the dappling of the horse,  which has been noticed by some authors with surprise, is a modification or  vestige of a tendency to become striped.    (FIGURE 1. DUN DEVONSHIRE PONY, with shoulder, spinal, and leg stripes.)    [This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects an  interesting fact. Horses of all colours, of the most diverse breeds, in  various parts of the world, often have a dark stripe extending along the  spine, from the mane to the tail; but this is so common that I need enter  into no particulars. (2/33. Some details are given in 'The Farrier' 1828  pages 452, 455. One of the smallest ponies I ever saw, of the colour of a  mouse, had a conspicuous spinal stripe. A small Indian chestnut pony had  the same stripe, as had a remarkably heavy chestnut cart-horse. Race-horses  often have the spinal stripe.) Occasionally horses are transversely barred  on the legs, chiefly on the under side; and more rarely they have a  distinct stripe on the shoulder, like that on the shoulder of the ass, or a  broad dark patch representing a stripe. Before entering on any details I  must premise that the term dun-coloured is vague, and includes three groups  of colours, viz., that between cream-colour and reddish-brown, which  graduates into light-bay or light-chestnut--this, I believe is often called  fallow-dun; secondly, leaden or slate-colour or mouse-dun, which graduates  into an ash-colour; and, lastly, dark-dun, between brown and black. In  England I have examined a rather large, lightly-built, fallow-dun  Devonshire pony (Figure 1), with a conspicuous stripe along the back, with  light transverse stripes on the under sides of its front legs, and with  four parallel stripes on each shoulder. Of these four stripes the posterior  one was very minute and faint; the anterior one, on the other hand, was  long and broad, but interrupted in the middle, and truncated at its lower  extremity, with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point. I  mention this latter fact because the shoulder-stripe of the ass  occasionally presents exactly the same appearance. I have had an outline  and description sent to me of a small, purely-bred, light fallow-dun Welch  pony, with a spinal stripe, a single transverse stripe on each leg, and  three shoulder-stripes; the posterior stripe corresponding with that on the  shoulder of the ass was the longest, whilst the two anterior parallel  stripes, arising from the mane, decreased in length, in a reversed manner  as compared with the shoulder-stripes on the above-described Devonshire  pony. I have seen a bright fallow-dun cob, with its front legs transversely  barred on the under sides in the most conspicuous manner; also a dark-  leaden mouse-coloured pony with similar leg stripes, but much less  conspicuous; also a bright fallow-dun colt, fully three-parts thoroughbred,  with very plain transverse stripes on the legs; also a chestnut-dun cart-  horse with a conspicuous spinal stripe, with distinct traces of shoulder-  stripes, but none on the legs; I could add other cases. My son made a  sketch for me of a large, heavy, Belgian cart-horse, of a fallow-dun, with  a conspicuous spinal stripe, traces of leg-stripes, and with two parallel  (three inches apart) stripes about seven or eight inches in length on both  shoulders. I have seen another rather light cart-horse, of a dirty dark  cream-colour, with striped legs, and on one shoulder a large ill-defined  dark cloudy patch, and on the opposite shoulder two parallel faint stripes.

In the midst of the rejoicing, Robin bade the foresters farewell,  clasped his cousin in his arms, the Sheriff was properly punished, and  the merriest of operas came to an end.          FLOTOW      There has never been more uncertainty and disagreement about the  production, composition, and source of any opera than about the opera  of \"Martha.\" Among the reasonable guesses as to its source is one that  Flotow found the theme for the story in a French ballet named \"Lady  Henriette, ou la Foire de Richmond,\" also, \"Lady Harriette, ou la  Servante de Greenwich.\" Among the German titles we find \"Martha, oder  der Markt zu Richmond,\" and \"Martha, oder der Maegdemarkt zu Richmond.\"  When all is said and done, it is still a German opera.    Flotow belonged to the petty nobility of Mecklenburg. He was destined  for the diplomatic profession and his art work was continually  interrupted by revolutions in his own country and in France.    He had already written a number of unimportant pieces before he  undertook \"Martha.\" This opera was made under particularly interesting  circumstances, being originally the work of three composers. The  Marquis Saint-Georges--the librettist of the day--asked Flotow to  undertake the music of one act only, as the other two had already been  assigned to two different composers. This proved to be on account of a  contract made by the manager of the Grand Opera with the French  Government to produce a new ballet in three acts every year--and the  Marquis had tried to evade the contract on the ground that it would  bankrupt him. The manager's _Premiere_ heard of this appeal, and she  in her turn went to headquarters, asking that the manager be compelled  to put on the piece as agreed. The next day he received an offer of  100,000 francs to mount the new ballet if he would put the dancer,  Mlle. Dumilatre, into the leading part, and do it in an incredibly  short time. This was how three composers brought into being the piece  that one day was to become the \"Martha\" with which we are now  familiar. After Flotow had written \"Stradella\" he was asked to write  an opera for the court, and remembering the peculiarly carpentered  piece, \"Martha,\" he went to Saint-Georges's ballet for his court-opera  theme. When finished it was \"Martha.\"    The librettist for \"Martha\" and another Flotow piece was Reise, but he  wrote under the name of W. Friedrich. Balfe used the story for an  opera which he called \"The Maid of Honour.\" The opera was about ten  years in gaining popularity outside of Germany. It was perhaps  somewhat longer than that in reaching Paris and London. It was known  in New York, having been presented at Niblo's Garden, before it was  known in Paris or London, and Madame Anna Bishop sang it. The great  singers who have appeared in the cast are Anna Bishop, Mario, Lehman,  Nilsson, Patti, Brignoli, and others.    Flotow's best claim to distinction lies in this opera of \"Martha.\" He  was not a special favourite nor a genius, but in \"Martha\" he turned  out a number of fascinating tunes of a humable sort. One of them has  been adapted to sacred words, and is much used in churches, but for  the most part \"Martha\" is made of a series of jiggy choruses. Berlioz,  who especially hated Flotow, declared that the \"introduction of the  Irish melody ('Last Rose of Summer') served to disinfect the  rottenness of the Martha music.\"    Flotow was born April 27, 1812.

Composer: Friedrich Freiherr von Flotow.  Author: W. Friedrich (F.W. Riese).      ACT I    One morning during fair time in Richmond the Lady Harriet, maid of  honour to her Majesty Queen Anne, was sitting in her boudoir at her  toilet table. She and all her maids and women friends who were  attending at her toilet were bored to death.    \"Did any one ever know such a stupid, dismal life as we are leading?\"  they declared. \"In heaven's name, why doesn't some one think of  something to do that will vary the monotony of this routine existence?  We rise in the morning, make a toilet, go to her Majesty, make a  toilet, breakfast, read to her Majesty, make a toilet, dine, walk with  her Majesty, sup, unmake a toilet and go to bed! Of all the awful  existences I really believe ours has become the most so.\"    \"It is as you say, but we cannot improve matters by groaning about it.  Lady Harriet, Sir Tristram has sent you some flowers,\" Nancy, Lady  Harriet's favourite, cried, handing them to her ladyship.    \"Well, do you call that something new? because I don't! Why doesn't  the cook send me some flowers--or maybe the hostler--somebody,  something new? Take them out of my sight--and Sir Tristram with them,  in case he appears.\"    \"Look at these diamonds: they sparkle like morning showers on the  flowers. The sight of them is enough to please any one!\"    \"It is not enough to please me,\" Lady Harriet declared petulantly,  determined to be pleased with nothing.    \"Who is that? There is some one who wishes an audience with me! I'll  see no one.\"    \"Ah,\" a man's voice announced from the curtains, \"but I have come to  tell you of something new, Lady Harriet!\"    \"You? Sir Tristram? Is there anything new under the sun? If you really  have something to suggest that is worth hearing, you may come in.\"    \"Listen, ladies! and tell me if I haven't conceived a clever thought.  The fair is on at Richmond----\"    \"Well--it is always on, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, no, ladies. Only once a year--this is the time. There is a fair  and there are cock-fights----\"    \"Ah--that sounds rather thrilling.\"    \"And donkeys----\"    \"Oh, there are always donkeys--always!\" the ladies cried, looking  hopelessly at poor Sir Tristram.    \"I mean _real_ donkeys,\" the poor man explained patiently.    \"So do we mean _real_ donkeys,\" they sighed.    \"And there are the races--and--well, if you will come I am certain  there are several new attractions. Let me take you, Lady Harriet, and  I promise to make you forget your _ennui_ for once. Cock-fights  and----\"    \"Donkeys,\" she sighed, rising. \"Very well, one might as well die of  donkeys and cock-fights as of nothing at all. It is too hot, open the  window----\"    \"I fly.\"    \"Oh, heavens! now it is too cold--shut it----\"    \"I fly,\" the unhappy Sir Tristram replied.    \"Give me my fan----\"    \"I fly.\" He flies.    \"O lord, I don't want it----\"    \"I fl--oh!\" he sighed and sank into a chair, exhausted.    [Music:         Come away,       Maidens gay,       To the fair       All repair,       Let us go,       Let us show       Willing hearts,       Fair deserts!]    \"What is that?\" Harriet asked impatiently, as she heard this gay  chorus sung just outside her windows.    \"A gay measure: the girls and lads going to the fair,\" Nancy replied.    \"Servant girls and stable boys--bah!\"    \"Yes--shocking! Who would give them a thought?\" Sir Tristram rashly  remarked.    \"Why, I don't know! after all, they sound very gay indeed. You haven't  very good taste, Sir Tristram, I declare.\" And at this the poor old  fop should have seen that she would contradict anything that he said.    \"Oh, I remember now! Fair day is the day when all the pretty girls  dress in their best and go to the fair to seek for places, to get  situations. They hire themselves out for a certain length of  time!--till next year, I think. Meantime they dance in their best  dresses and have a very gay day of it.\"    \"That sounds to me rather attractive,\" Lady Harriet remarked  thoughtfully.    \"A foolish fancy, your ladyship,\" the unfortunate Sir Tristram put in.    \"Now I am resolved to go! Get me that bodice I wore at the fancy dress  ball, Nancy. We shall all go--I shall be Martha,--Nancy, and old Rob.\"    \"And--and who may be 'old Rob,' your ladyship?\" Sir Tristram asked,  feeling much pained at this frivolity.    \"Why, you, to be sure. Come! No mumps! No dumps! We are off!\"    \"Oh, this is too much.\"    \"What, Sir Tristram, is that the extent of your love for me?\"    \"No, no--I shall do as you wish--but,\" the poor old chap sighed  heavily.    \"To be sure you will--so now, Nancy, teach old Rob how the yokels  dance, and we'll be off.\"    \"This is too much. I can't dance in that manner.\"    \"Dance--or leave me! Dance--or stay at home, sir!\" Harriet cried  sternly.    \"O heaven--I'll dance,\" and so he tried, and the teases put him  through all the absurd paces they knew, till he fell exhausted into a  seat.    \"That was almost true to nature,\" they laughed. \"You will do, so come  along. But don't forget your part. Don't let us see any of the airs of  a nobleman or you shall leave us. We'll take you, but if you forget  your part we shall certainly leave you,\" and they dragged him off  recklessly.    At the fair, ribbons were flying, bands were playing, lads and lasses  were dancing, and farmers were singing:    [Music:         Bright and buxom lasses,         Come, the fair shall now begin,       Show your rosy faces         And our hearts ye soon shall win.]         Fleet of foot, and clad with neatness,         Come and let the master choose;       Sweet of temper, all discreetness,         Who a prize like this would lose?         Done is the bargain if the maid is trusty,         blythe and willing;       Done is the bargain if she accepts the master's         proffered shilling!    Thus, the farmers who had come to the fair to choose a maid-servant,  sang together. The maid-servants were"]]]
