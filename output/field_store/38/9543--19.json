CHAPTER III    THE INFLUENCE OF THE WEST      The influence of the West is the great dynamic in the modern  transformation of the East. The ubiquitous impact of Westernism is  modifying not merely the Islamic world but all non-Moslem Asia and  Africa,[72] and in subsequent pages we shall examine the effects of  Western influence upon the non-Moslem elements of India. Of course  Western influence does not entirely account for Islam's recent  evolution. We have already seen that, for the last hundred years, Islam  itself has been engendering forces which, however quickened by external  Western stimuli, are essentially internal in their nature, arising  spontaneously and working toward distinctive, original goals. It is not  a mere copying of the West that is to-day going on in the Moslem world,  but an attempt at a new synthesis--an assimilation of Western methods to  Eastern ends. We must always remember that the Asiatic stocks which  constitute the bulk of Islam's followers are not primitive savages like  the African negroes or the Australoids, but are mainly peoples with  genuine civilizations built up by their own efforts from the remote  past. In view of their historic achievements, therefore, it seems safe  to conclude that in the great ferment now stirring the Moslem world we  behold a real _Renaissance_, whose genuineness is best attested by the  fact that there have been similar movements in former times.    The modern influence of the West on the East is quite unprecedented in  both intensity and scope. The far more local, partial influence of  Greece and Rome cannot be compared to it. Another point to be noted is  that this modern influence of the West upon the East is a very recent  thing. The full impact of Westernism upon the Orient as a whole dates  only from about the middle of the nineteenth century. Since then,  however, the process has been going on by leaps and bounds. Roads and  railways, posts and telegraphs, books and papers, methods and ideas,  have penetrated, or are in process of penetrating, every nook and cranny  of the East. Steamships sail the remotest seas. Commerce drives forth  and scatters the multitudinous products of Western industry among the  remotest peoples. Nations which only half a century ago lived the life  of thirty centuries ago, to-day read newspapers and go to business in  electric tram-cars. Both the habits and thoughts of Orientals are being  revolutionized. To a discussion of the influence of the West upon the  Moslem world the remainder of this book will be devoted. The chief  elements will be separately analysed in subsequent chapters, the present  chapter being a general survey of an introductory character.    The permeation of Westernism is naturally most advanced in those parts  of Islam which have been longest under Western political control. The  penetration of the British \"Raj\" into the remotest Indian jungles, for  example, is an extraordinary phenomenon. By the coinage, the  post-office, the railroads, the administration of justice, the  encouragement of education, the relief of famine, and a thousand other  ways, the great organization has penetrated all India. But even in  regions where European control is still nominal, the permeation of  Westernism has gone on apace. The customs and habits of the people have  been distinctly modified. Western material improvements and comforts  like the kerosene-oil lamp and the sewing-machine are to-day part and  parcel of the daily life of the people. New economic wants have been  created; standards of living have been raised; canons of taste have been  altered.[73]    In the intellectual and spiritual fields, likewise, the leaven of  Westernism is clearly apparent. We have already seen how profoundly  Moslem liberal reformers have been influenced by Western ideas and the  spirit of Western progress. Of course in these fields Westernism has  progressed more slowly and has awakened much stronger opposition than it  has on the material plane. Material innovations, especially mechanical  improvements, comforts, and luxuries, make their way much faster than  novel customs or ideas, which usually shock established beliefs or  ancestral prejudices. Tobacco was taken up with extraordinary rapidity  by every race and clime, and the kerosene-lamp has in half a century  penetrated the recesses of Central Asia and of China; whereas customs  like Western dress and ideas like Western education encounter many  setbacks and are often adopted with such modifications that their  original spirit is denatured or perverted. The superior strength and  skill of the West are to-day generally admitted throughout the East, but  in many quarters the first receptivity to Western progress and zeal for  Western ideas have cooled or have actually given place to a reactionary  hatred of the very spirit of Western civilization.[74]    Western influences are most apparent in the upper and middle classes,  especially in the Western-educated _intelligentsia_ which to-day exists  in every Eastern land. These elites of course vary greatly in numbers  and influence, but they all possess a more or less definite grasp of  Western ideas. In their reactions to Westernism they are sharply  differentiated. Some, while retaining the fundamentals of their  ancestral philosophy of life, attempt a genuine assimilation of Western  ideals and envisage a higher synthesis of the spirits of East and West.  Others break with their traditional pasts, steep themselves in  Westernism, and become more or less genuinely Westernized. Still others  conceal behind their Western veneer disillusionment and detestation.[75]    Of course it is in externals that Westernization is most pronounced.

If I should write to       you of all the reviling speeches and filthie language she hath vsed       towards me I should but grieve you. My husband hath vsed all meanes       for to reforme her, reasons and perswasions, but shee doth profess       that her heart and her nature will not suffer her to confesse her       faults. If I tell my husband of her behavior towards me, vpon       examination she will denie all she hath done or spoken, so that we       know not how to proceed against her.\"    We must not forget that the Winthrops had the best opportunity of any in  the land to have good servants; for not only were help placed in their  families, but the best of English servants were consigned to them; yet  neither the Governor's sister, Madam Downing, nor his daughter, Madam  Dudley, could be \"suited.\" And hear the plaint of John Winthrop to his  father in 1717:         \"It is not convenient now to write the trouble and plague we have       had with this Irish creature the year past. Lying and unfaithfull;       w'd doe things on purpose in contradiction and vexation to her       mistress; lye out of the house anights and have contrivances w'th       fellows that have been stealing from o'r estate and gett drink out       of ye cellar for them; saucy and impudent, as when we have taken       her to task for her wickedness she has gone away to complain of       cruell usage. I can truly say we have used this base creature w'th       a great deal of kindness and lenity. She w'd frequently take her       mistresses capps and stockins, hankerchers etc., to dresse herselfe       and away without leave among her companions. I may have said some       time or other when she has been in fault that she was fitt to live       nowhere but in Virginia, and if she w'd not mend her ways I should       send her thither tho I am sure nobody w'd give her passage thither       to have her service for twenty yeares she is such a high-spirited       pirnicious jade. Robin has been run away neare ten dayes as you       will see by the inclosed and this creature know of his going and of       his carrying out 4 dozen bottles of cyder, metheglin and palme wine       out of the cellar among the servants of the town and meat and I       know not w't. The bottles they broke and threw away after they had       drunk up the liquor, and they got up o'r sheep anight, killed a       fatt one, roasted and made merry w'th it before morning.\"    This wild Irish girl was indentured to the unfortunate Winthrop and his  more unfortunate wife for four years, and was to have fifty shillings  and some other start in the world when her time was up.    Out-of-the-way plantations fared no better in the question of service.  John Wynter, the head agent of the settlement at Richmonds Island in  Maine, wrote thus resentfully in 1639, to Mr. Trelawny, of the London  company, of his maid, one Priscilla Beckford:         \"You write of some yll reports is given of my Wyfe for beatinge the       maide: yf a faire waye will not doe yt, beatinge must sometimes       vppon such Idlle girrels as she is. Yf you think yt fitte for my       Wyfe to do all the work, and the maide sitt still, and she must       forbear her hands to strike, then the work will ly vndonn. She hath       bin now 2-1/2 yeares in the house & I do not thinke she hath risen       20 tymes before my Wyfe hath bin vp to Call her, and many tymes       light the fire before she comes out of her bed. She hath twice gone       a mechinge in the woodes which we have bin fain to send all our       Company to seek her. We can hardly keep her within doors after we       are gonn to bed except we carry the kay of the door to bed with vs.       She coulde never milke Cow nor Goate since she came hither. Our men       do not desire to have her boyl the kittle for them she is so       sluttish. She cannot be trusted to serve a few piggs but my Wyfe       must commonly be with her. She hath written home I heare that she       was fain to ly vppon goates skinns. She might take some goates       skinns to ly in her bedd but not given to her for her lodginge. For       a yeare & quarter or more she lay with my daughter vppon a good       feather bed; before my daughter being lacke 3 or 4 days to Sacco       the maid goes into bed with her cloths & stockins & would not take       the paines to pluck off her Cloths; her bed after was a doust bedd       & shee had 2 Coverletts to ly on her, but Sheets she had none,       after that tyme she was found to be so sluttish. Her beatinge that       she hath had hath never hurt her body nor limes. She is so fatt &       soggy she can hardly do any worke. Yf this maide at her lazy tymes       when she hath bin found in her yll accyons do not deserve 2 or 3       blowes I pray you who hath the most reason to complain my Wyfe or       maide. My Wyfe hath an Vnthankefull office. Yt does not please me       well, being she hath taken so much paines and care to order things       as well as she could, and ryse in the morning rath & go to bed soe       latte, and have hard speeches for yt.\"    We can well imagine his exhausted patience, and that of poor overworked  Mistress Wynter, at that fat soggy thing, that lag-last, so shiftless  and useless about the house, lazing from rath to latte, and then to  complete their exasperation, miching off into the woods to shirk her  work so that the whole company had to turn out with a mort of trouble to  hunt for the leg-trape. We cannot marvel at the beating, but simply  wonder at its being remarked in those days of many and hard beatings,  when scholars, servants, soldiers, and college students were well  whipped, and, in Old England, wives also.    Wynter had no better fortune without doors with his men-servants and  workmen; they proved kittle cattle. He found them not \"plyable\" or  \"condishionabell,\" that they \"spoke Fair to the Face and Colloged behind  the back.\" Of one malcontent he wrote,         \"He is verry vnwilling to do vs servize, he is alwaies too hard       labored, he cares not what Spoyle he makes, and will not be       commanded but when he list. He is such a talkinge Fellow as makes       our company worse than would be.\"    He says his bound servants ran away at their pleasure, worked when they  pleased, and led others off to their lure, and should be punished if  they had returned to England. One only was \"frace\" of his ways and  promised to do better. Not only do we gain from Wynter's letters a  knowledge of the pains of colonial domestic service, but I know among  New England historical collections no other such well of good old  English words and phrases.    The Declaration of Independence did not better the aspect of the servant  question. The _Providence Gazette_ advertised in 1796 that a reward of  five hundred dollars and the \"warmest blessings of abused householders\"  would be given to any restoring the conditions of the good old times, or  rather what they fancied was        \"The constant service of the antique world       When service sweat for duty not for meed.\"    The notice opens thus:         \"Was mislaid or taken away by mistake, soon after the formation of       the abolition society, from the servant girls in this town all       inclination to do any kind of work, and left in lieu thereof an       independent appearance, a strong and continued thirst for high       wages, a gossiping disposition for every sort of amusement, a       leering and hankering after persons of the other sex, a desire of       finery and fashion, a never-ceasing trot after new places, more       advantageous for stealing, with a number of contingent       accomplishments that do not suit the wearers.\"    President Dwight wrote that the servants of that day were \"distinguished  for vice and profligacy;\" so the nineteenth century opened no more  promisingly than the eighteenth.    The pious colonists felt that great spiritual, as well as temporal  responsibility rested upon them in regard to their bond-servants. We  find in contemporary letters frequent reference to the souls of the  indentured ones; Englishmen at the old home wrote to the settlers to  remember well their religious, their proselyting duties; and they  faithfully reminded each other of their accountability for souls. For  instance, when a smart young Irishman came over with some Irish hounds,  his consigner besought the New Englanders to remember that it was as  godly to \"winne this fellowes soule out of the subtillest snare of  Sathan, Romes pollitick religion, as to winne an Indian soule out of the  Dieuells clawes;\" and he urged them to watch the Papist narrowly as to  his carriage in Puritandom, his attitude toward Protestantism. This was  the same religious zeal that led the Boston elders to send missionaries  from New England to convert the heathen of the Established Church in  Virginia.    The moral and religious condition of these servants was truly of great  importance in the preservation of such a theocracy as was New England,  since few of them returned to England, but after serving out their time  became freemen with homes and land and votes of their own; and the  commonwealth could not live as a religious organization unless it  thrived through the religious spirit of its citizens.    One other form of domestic service existed until this century. A limited  amount of assistance was given in some households by those unhappy  wights, the town-poor. These wretched paupers were sold to the lowest  bidder. Sometimes the buyer received but a few shillings a year from the  town for the \"keep\" of one of these helpless souls. We may be sure that  he got some work out of the pauper to pay"]]]
