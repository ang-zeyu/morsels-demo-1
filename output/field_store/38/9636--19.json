It is possible, therefore, from the measurements of this chamber,  to compute with considerable accuracy the absolute volume. The apparent  volume has been calculated to be 1,347 liters.      OPENINGS IN THE CHAMBER.    In order to communicate with the interior of the chamber, maintain a  ventilating air-current, and provide for the passage of the current of  water for the heat-absorber system and the large number of electrical  connections, a number of openings through the walls of the chamber were  necessary. The great importance of maintaining this chamber absolutely  air-tight renders it necessary to minimize the number of these openings,  to reduce their size as much as possible, and to take extra precaution  in securing their closure during an experiment. The largest opening is  obviously the trap-door at the top through which the subject enters,  shown in dotted outline in fig. 7. While somewhat inconvenient to enter  the chamber in this way, the entrance from above possesses many  advantages. It is readily closed and sealed by hot wax and rarely is a  leakage experienced. The trap-door is constructed on precisely the same  plan as the rest of the calorimeter, having its double walls of copper  and zinc, its thermal-junction system, its heating wires and  connections, and its cooling pipes. When closed and sealed, and the  connections made with the cooling pipes and heating wires, it presents  an appearance not differing from any other portion of the calorimeter.    The next largest opening is the food-aperture, which is a large  sheet-copper tube, somewhat flattened, thus giving a slightly oval form,  closed with a port, such as is used on vessels. The door of the port  consists of a heavy brass frame with a heavy glass window and it can be  closed tightly by means of a rubber gasket and two thumbscrews. On the  outside is used a similar port provided with a tube somewhat larger in  diameter than that connected with the inner port. The annular space  between these tubes is filled with a pneumatic gasket which can be  inflated and thus a tight closure may be maintained. When one door is  closed and the other opened, articles can be placed in and taken out of  the chamber without the passage of a material amount of air from the  chamber to the room outside or into the chamber from outside.    The air-pipes passing through the wall of the calorimeter are of  standard 1-inch piping. The insulation from the copper wall is made by a  rubber stopper through which this piping is passed, the stopper being  crowded into a brass ferule which is stoutly soldered to the copper  wall. This is shown in detail in fig. 25, in which N is the brass ferule  and M the rubber stopper through which the air-pipe passes. The closure  is absolutely air-tight and a minimum amount of heat is conducted out of  the chamber, owing to the insulation of the rubber stopper M. The  water-current enters and leaves the chamber through two pipes insulated  in two similar brass ferules soldered to the copper and zinc walls. The  insulation between the water-pipe and the brass ferule has been the  subject of much experimenting and is discussed on page 24. The best  insulation was secured by a vacuum-jacketed glass tube, although the  special hard-rubber tubes surrounding the electric-resistance  thermometers have proven very effective as insulators in the bed  calorimeter.    A series of small brass tubes, from 10 to 15 millimeters in diameter,  are soldered into the copper wall in the vicinity of the water-pipes.  These are used for electrical connections and for connections with the  manometer, stethoscope, and pneumograph. All of these openings are  tested carefully and shown to be absolutely air-tight before being put  in use.    In the dome of the calorimeter, and directly over the head of the  subject, is the opening for the weighing apparatus. This consists of a  hard-rubber tube, threaded at one end and screwed into a brass flange  heavily soldered to the copper wall (fig. 9). When not in use, a solid  rubber stopper on a brass rod is drawn into this opening, thus  producing an air-tight closure. When in actual use during the process of  weighing, a thin rubber diaphragm prevents leakage of air through this  opening. The escape of heat through the weighing-tube is minimized by  having this tube of hard rubber.      VENTILATING AIR-CURRENT.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Diagram of ventilation of respiration  calorimeter. The air is taken out at lower right-hand corner and forced  by the blower through the apparatus for absorbing water and carbon  dioxide. It returns to the calorimeter at the top. Oxygen can be  introduced into the chamber itself as need is shown by the tension  equalizer.]    The ventilating air-current is so adjusted that the air which leaves the  chamber is caused to pass through purifiers, where the water-vapor and  the carbon dioxide are removed, and then, after being replenished with  fresh oxygen, it is returned to the chamber ready for use. The general  scheme of the respiration apparatus is shown in fig. 27. The air leaving  the chamber contains carbon dioxide and water-vapor and the original  amount of nitrogen and is somewhat deficient in oxygen. In order to  purify the air it must be passed through absorbents for carbonic acid  and water-vapor and hence some pressure is necessary to force the gas  through these purifying vessels. This pressure is obtained by a small  positive rotary blower, which has been described previously in  detail.[18] The air is thus forced successively through sulphuric acid,  soda or potash-lime, and again sulphuric acid. Finally it is directed  back to the respiration chamber free from carbon dioxide and water and  deficient in oxygen. Pure oxygen is admitted to the chamber to make up  the deficiency, and the air thus regenerated is breathed again by the  subject.      BLOWER.    The rotary blower used in these experiments for maintaining the  ventilating current of air has given the greatest satisfaction. It is a  so-called positive blower and capable of producing at the outlet  considerable pressure and at the inlet a vacuum of several inches of  mercury. At a speed of 230 revolutions per minute it delivers the air at  a pressure of 43 millimeters of mercury, forcing it through the  purifying vessels at the rate of 75 liters per minute. This rate of  ventilation has been established as being satisfactory for all  experiments and is constant. Under the pressure of 43 millimeters of  mercury there are possibilities of leakage of air from the blower  connections and hence, to note this immediately, the blower system is  immersed in a tank filled with heavy lubricating oil. The connections  are so well made, however, that leakage rarely occurs, and, when it  does, a slight tightening of the stuffing-box on the shaft makes the  apparatus tight again.      ABSORBERS FOR WATER-VAPOR.    To absorb 25 to 40 grams of water-vapor in an hour from a current of air  moving at the rate of 75 liters per minute and leaving the air  essentially dry under these conditions has been met by the apparatus  herewith described. The earlier attempts to secure this result involved  the use of enameled-iron soup-stock pots, fitted with special  enameled-iron covers and closed with rubber gaskets. For the preliminary  experimenting and for a few experiments with man these proved  satisfactory, but in spite of their resistance to the action of  sulphuric acid, it was found that they were not as desirable as they  should be for continued experimenting from year to year. Recourse was  then had to a special form of chemical pottery, glazed, and a type that  usually gives excellent satisfaction in manufacturing concerns was used.    This special form of absorbers presented many difficulties in  construction, but the mechanical difficulties were overcome by the  potter's skill and a number of such vessels were furnished by the  Charles Graham Chemical Pottery Works. Here again these vessels served  our purpose for several months, but unfortunately the glaze used did not  suffice to cover them completely and there was a slight, though  persistent, leakage of sulphuric acid through the porous walls. To  overcome this difficulty the interior of the vessels was coated with hot  paraffin after a long-continued washing to remove the acid and after  they had been allowed to dry thoroughly. The paraffin-treated absorbers  continued to give satisfaction, but it was soon seen that for permanent  use something more satisfactory must be had. After innumerable trials  with glazed vessels of different kinds of pottery and glass,  arrangements were made with the Royal Berlin Porcelain Works to mold and  make these absorbers out of their highly resistant porcelain. The result  thus far leaves nothing to be desired as a vessel for this purpose. A  number of such absorbers were made and have been constantly used for a  year and are absolutely without criticism.    Fig. 28 shows the nature of the interior of the apparatus. The air  enters through one opening at the top, passes down through a bent pipe,  and enters a series of roses, consisting of inverted circular saucers  with holes in the rims. The position of the holes is such that when the  vessel is one-fourth to one-third full of sulphuric acid the air must  pass through the acid three times. To prevent spattering, a small  cup-shaped arrangement, provided with holes, is attached to the opening  through which the air passes out of the absorber, and for filling the  vessel with acid a small opening is made near one edge. The  specifications required that the apparatus should be made absolutely  air-tight to pressures of over 1 meter of water, and that there is no  porosity in these vessels under these conditions is shown by the fact  that such a pressure is held indefinitely.
