As the  final state is being approached, and as the velocity of the earth's  rotation is approximating to the angular velocity with which the moon  revolves around it, the ebbing and the flowing of the lunar tides must  become of evanescent importance; and this indeed for a double reason,  partly on account of the moon's greatly augmented distance, and  partly on account of the increasing length of the lunar day, and the  extremely tardy movements of ebb and flow that the lunar tides will  then have. Thus the lunar tides, so far as their dynamical importance  is concerned, will ultimately become zero, while the solar tides  retain all their pristine efficiency.    We have therefore to examine the dynamical effects of solar tides on  the earth and moon in the critical stage to which the present course  of things tends. The earth will then rotate in a period of about  fifty-seven of its present days; and considering that the length of  the day, though so much greater than our present day, is still much  less than the year, it follows that the solar tides must still  continue so as to bring the earth's velocity of rotation to a point  even lower than it has yet attained. In fact, if we could venture to  project our glance sufficiently far into the future, it would seem  that the earth must ultimately have its velocity checked by the  sun-raised tides, until the day itself had become equal to the year.  The dynamical considerations become, however, too complex for us to  follow them, so that I shall be content with merely pointing out that  the influence of the solar tides will prevent the earth and moon from  eternally preserving the relations of bending the same face towards  each other; the earth's motion will, in fact, be so far checked, that  the day will become _longer_ than the month.    Thus the doctrine of tidal evolution has conducted us to a prospect of  a condition of things which will some time be reached, when the moon  will have receded to a distance in which the month shall have become  about fifty-seven days, and when the earth around which this moon  revolves shall actually require a still longer period to accomplish  its rotation on its axis. Here is an odd condition for a planet with  its satellite; indeed, until a dozen years ago it would have been  pronounced inconceivable that a moon should whirl round a planet so  quickly that its journey was accomplished in less than one of the  planet's own days. Arguments might be found to show that this was  impossible, or at least unprecedented. There is our own moon, which  now takes twenty-seven days to go round the earth; there is Jupiter,  with four moons, and the nearest of these to the primary goes round  in forty-two and a half hours. No doubt this is a very rapid motion;  but all those matters are much more lively with Jupiter than they are  here. The giant planet himself does not need ten hours for a single  rotation, so that you see his nearest moon still takes between two and  three Jovian days to accomplish a single revolution. The example of  Saturn might have been cited to show that the quickest revolution that  any satellite could perform must still require at least twice as long  as the day in which the planet performed its rotation. Nor could the  rotation of the planets around the sun afford a case which could be  cited. For even Mercury, the nearest of all the planets to the sun of  which the existence is certainly known, and therefore the most rapid  in its revolution, requires eighty-eight days to get round once; and  in the mean time the sun has had time to accomplish between three and  four rotations. Indeed, the analogies would seem to have shown so  great an improbability in the conclusion towards which tidal evolution  points, that they would have contributed a serious obstacle to the  general acceptance of that theory.    But in 1877 an event took place so interesting in astronomical  history, that we have to look back to the memorable discovery of  Uranus in 1781 before we can find a parallel to it in importance. Mars  had always been looked upon as one of the moonless planets, though  grounds were not wanting for the surmise that probably moons to Mars  really existed. It was under the influence of this belief that an  attempt was made by Professor Asaph Hall at Washington to make a  determined search, and see if Mars might not be attended by satellites  large enough to be discoverable. The circumstances under which this  memorable inquiry was undertaken were eminently favourable for its  success. The orbit of Mars is one which possesses an exceptionally  high eccentricity; it consequently happens that the oppositions during  which the planet is to be observed vary very greatly in the facilities  they afford for a search like that contemplated by Professor Hall. It  is obviously advantageous that the planet should be situated as near  as possible to the earth, and in the opposition in 1877 the distance  was almost at the lowest point it is capable of attaining; but this  was not the only point in which Professor Hall was favoured; he had  the use of a telescope of magnificent proportions and of consummate  optical perfection. His observatory was also placed in Washington, so  that he had the advantage of a pure sky and of a much lower latitude  than any observatory in Great Britain is placed at. But the most  conspicuous advantage of all was the practised skill of the astronomer  himself, without which all these other advantages would have been but  of little avail. Great success rewarded his well-designed efforts; not  alone was one satellite discovered which revolved around the planet in  a period conformable with that of other similar cases, but a second  little satellite was found, which accomplished its revolution in a  wholly unexpected and unprecedented manner. The day of Mars himself,  that is, the period in which he can accomplish a rotation around his  axis, very closely approximates to our own day, being in fact half an  hour longer. This little satellite, the inner and more rapid of the  pair, requires for a single revolution a period of only seven hours  thirty-nine minutes, that is to say, the little body scampers more  than three times round its primary before the primary itself has  finished one of its leisurely rotations. Here was indeed a striking  fact, a unique fact in our system, which riveted the attention of  astronomers on this most beautiful discovery.    You will now see the bearing which the movement of the inner satellite  of Mars has on the doctrine of tidal evolution. As a legitimate  consequence of that doctrine, we came to the conclusion that our  earth-moon system must ultimately attain a condition in which the day  is longer than the month. But this conclusion stood unsupported by any  analogous facts in the more anciently-known truths of astronomy. The  movement of the satellite of Mars, however, affords the precise  illustration we want; and this fact, I think, adds an additional  significance to the interest and the beauty of Professor Hall's  discovery.    It is of particular interest to investigate the possible connection  which the phenomena of tidal evolution may have had in connection with  the geological phenomena of the earth. We have already pointed out the  greater closeness of the moon to us in times past. The tides raised by  the moon on the earth must therefore have been greater in past ages  than they are now, for of course the nearer the moon the bigger the  tide. As soon as the earth and the moon had separated to a  considerable distance we may say that the height of the tide will vary  inversely as the cube of the moon's distance; it will therefore  happen, that when the moon was at half its present distance from us,  his tide-producing capacity was not alone twice as much or four times  as much, but even eight times as much as it is at present; and a much  greater rate of tidal rise and fall indicates, of course, a  preponderance in every other manifestation of tidal activity. The  tidal currents, for instance, must have been much greater in volume  and in speed; even now there are places in which the tidal currents  flow at four or more miles per hour. We can imagine, therefore, the  vehemence of the tidal currents which must have flowed in those days  when the moon was a much smaller distance from us. It is interesting  to view these considerations in their possible bearings on geological  phenomena. It is true that we have here many elements of uncertainty,  but there is, however, a certain general outline of facts which may  be laid down, and which appears to be instructive, with reference to  the past history of our earth.    I have all through these lectures indicated a mighty system of  chronology for the earth-moon system. It is true that we cannot give  our chronology any accurate expression in years. The various stages of  this history are to be represented by the successive distances between  the earth and the moon. Each successive epoch, for instance, may be  marked by the number of thousands of miles which separate the moon  from the earth.    But we have another system of chronology derived from a wholly  different system of ideas; it too relates to periods of vast duration,  and, like our great tidal periods, extends to times anterior to human  history, or even to the duration of human life on this globe. The  facts of geology open up to us a majestic chronology, the epochs of  which are familiar to us by the succession of strata forming the crust  of the earth, and by the succession of living beings whose remains  these strata have preserved. From the present or recent age our  retrospect over geological chronology leads us to look through a  vista embracing periods of time overwhelming in their duration, until  at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24388"],[0,"Squirrels and Other Fur-Bearers (#16)"],[1,"and burrowed in the sand, and stole  some of the wool and feathers from hibernator to line his own nest. But  the jumping mouse went in with him, enlarged the nest, and cuddled down  to him. They were great friends. But the baby smelled dreadfully, as all  house-mice do, and I took him out. Then the hibernator curled up again  and went into winter quarters.    \"When the warm weather came on, she uncurled and ate and drank. She  preferred pecan nuts and shredded-wheat biscuit, and ate corn. I tried  to tame her. I took a strong feather and played with her. At first she  resisted and was frightened, but after a while she 'stood it,' and would  even eat and clean herself while I scratched her with this feather. But  she was always terribly frightened, when coming out of her day's sleep,  if I began to play with her. After being thoroughly waked up, she did  not mind it. She would let me smooth her with my finger, and she would  smell of my finger and go on eating, keeping an eye out. Three times she  had a perfect fit of fright, lying on her back, and kicking and  trembling violently. On these occasions she made a scuttling noise or  cry, and I thought each time she would die, so I grew more and more  cautious about meddling with her. There was one interesting thing about  it,--she rose from these fits and ate heartily, and cleaned herself  with great unconcern. I was tempted to believe that she shammed dying.    \"The most interesting thing I ever saw her do was to climb up on her  glass of water, sit on the rim, and put both little paws down and scoop  up a big double-handful of water and wash her face and head. She made  her face very wet, just like a person washing his face. She ate  sunflower seeds, and often kept one eye shut a long time on first waking  up. After the apple-blossoms came, I kept her box supplied with flowers,  such as apple-blossoms, cherry, spruce, maple, and so on. Also I kept  her box disinfected, with plenty of good, fresh country dirt. But she  stuck to the old wool and feathers, and the little piano-duster.\"    The mouse continued hibernating at intervals till May. One damp, chilly  morning Miss Burt thought she would add to her pet's coverings, the  creature seemed so cold to the touch. \"Little by little, much of her  bedding of wool had been removed, although she had a pretty good blanket  of it left, and the feather duster over her, which she appropriated long  ago. So I resolved to carry some bits of flannel to school and, when I  went to her box to give her the extra clothing, again found her as you  saw her, rolled up in a ball. I covered her carefully, wrapped her all  up, and put her back. Later in the day I peeped in, and she was awake.  In the afternoon I took her out in her little blanket and looked at her.  She was asleep, but started up, and, seeing herself out of her box, put  up her little paw in fright. She trembled violently, and I hastily  returned her to her box, but before I could cover her she fell back dead  of fright.\" Miss Burt adds: \"I have had her put in alcohol. One tiny paw  is raised imploringly, suggestive of the sensitive nerves that caused  her death.\"          XIV    GLIMPSES OF WILD LIFE      So fond am I of seeing Nature reassert herself that I even found some  compensation in the loss of my chickens that bright November night when  some wild creature, coon or fox, swept two of them out of the  evergreens, and their squawking as they were hurried across the lawn  called me from my bed to shout good-by after them. It gave a new  interest to the hen-roost, this sudden incursion of wild nature. I feel  bound to caution the boys about disturbing the wild rabbits that in  summer breed in my currant-patch, and in autumn seek refuge under my  study floor. The occasional glimpses I get of them about the lawn in the  dusk, their cotton tails twinkling in the dimness, afford me a genuine  pleasure. I have seen the time when I would go a good way to shoot a  partridge; but I would not have killed, if I could, the one that started  out of the vines that cover my rustic porch, as I approached that side  of the house one autumn morning. How much of the woods, and of the  untamable spirit of wild nature, she brought to my very door! It was  tonic and exhilarating to see her whirl away toward the vineyard. I also  owe a moment's pleasure to the gray squirrel that, finding my  summer-house in the line of his travels one summer day, ran through it  and almost over my feet as I sat idling with a book.    I am sure my power of digestion was improved that cold winter morning  when, just as we were sitting down to breakfast about sunrise, a red fox  loped along in front of the window, looking neither to the right nor to  the left, and disappeared amid the currant-bushes. What of the wild and  the cunning did he not bring! His graceful form and motion were in my  mind's eye all day. When you have seen a fox loping along in that way,  you have seen the poetry there is in the canine tribe. It is to the eye  what a flowing measure is to the mind, so easy, so buoyant; the furry  creature drifting along like a large red thistledown, or like a plume  borne by the wind. It is something to remember with pleasure, that a  muskrat sought my door one December night when a cold wave was swooping  down upon us. Was he seeking shelter, or had he lost his reckoning? The  dogs cornered him in the very doorway, and set up a great hubbub. In the  darkness, thinking it was a cat, I put my hand down to feel it. The  creature skipped to the other corner of the doorway, hitting my hand  with its cold, rope-like tail. Lighting a match, I had a glimpse of him  sitting up on his haunches like a woodchuck, confronting his enemies. I  rushed in for the lantern, with the hope of capturing him alive, but  before I returned, the dogs, growing bold, had finished him.    I have had but one call from a coon, that I am aware of, and I fear we  did not treat him with due hospitality. He took up his quarters for the  day in a Norway spruce, the branches of which nearly brushed the house.  I had noticed that the dog was very curious about that tree all the  afternoon. After dinner his curiosity culminated in repeated loud and  confident barking. Then I began an investigation, expecting to find a  strange cat, or at most a red squirrel. But a moment's scrutiny revealed  his coonship. Then how to capture him became the problem. A long pole  was procured, and I sought to dislodge him from his hold. The skill with  which he maintained himself amid the branches excited our admiration.  But after a time he dropped lightly to the ground, not in the least  disconcerted, and at once on his guard against both man and beast. The  dog was a coward, and dared not face him. When the coon's attention was  diverted, the dog would rush in; then one of us would attempt to seize  the coon's tail, but he faced about so quickly, his black eyes gleaming,  that the hand was timid about seizing him. But finally in his  skirmishing with the dog I caught him by the tail, and bore him safely  to an open flour-barrel, and he was our prisoner.    Much amusement my little boy and I anticipated with him. He partook of  food that same day, and on the second day would eat the chestnuts in our  presence. Never did he show the slightest fear of us or of anything, but  he was unwearied in his efforts to regain his freedom. After a few days  we put a strap upon his neck and kept him tethered by a chain. But in  the night, by dint of some hocus-pocus, he got the chain unsnapped and  made off, and he is now, I trust, a patriarch of his tribe, wearing a  leather necktie.    The skunk visits every farm sooner or later. One night I came near  shaking hands with one on my very door-stone. I thought it was the cat,  and put down my hand to stroke it, when the creature, probably  appreciating my mistake, moved off up the bank, revealing to me the  white stripe on its body and the kind of cat I had saluted. The skunk is  not easily ruffled, and seems to employ excellent judgment in the use of  its terrible weapon.    Several times I have had calls from woodchucks. One looked in at the  open door of my study one day, and, after sniffing a while, and not  liking the smell of such clover as I was compelled to nibble there,  moved on to better pastures. Another one invaded the kitchen door while  we were at dinner. The dogs promptly challenged him, and there was a  lively scrimmage upon the door-stone. I thought the dogs were fighting,  and rushed to part them. The incident broke in upon the drowsy summer  noon, as did the appearance of the muskrat upon the frigid December  night.    The woodchuck episode that afforded us the most amusement occurred one  midsummer. We were at work in a newly-planted vineyard, when the man  with the cultivator saw, a few yards in front of him, some large gray  object that at first puzzled him. He approached it, and found it to be  an old woodchuck with a young one in her mouth. She was carrying her  kitten as does a cat, by the nape of the neck. Evidently she was moving  her family to pastures new. As the man was in the line of her march, she  stopped and considered what was to be done. He called to me, and I  approached slowly. As the mother saw me closing in on her flank, she was  suddenly seized with a panic, and, dropping her young, she fled  precipitately for the cover of a large pile of grape-posts some ten or  twelve rods distant. We pursued hotly, and overhauled her as she was  within one jump of the house of refuge. Taking her by the tail, I  carried her back to her baby; but she heeded it not. It was only her own  bacon now that she was solicitous about. The young one remained where he  had been dropped, keeping up a brave, reassuring whistle that was in  ludicrous contrast to his exposed and helpless condition. He was the  smallest woodchuck I had ever seen, not much larger than a large rat.  His head"]]]
