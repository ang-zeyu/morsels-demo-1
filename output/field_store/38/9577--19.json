We heard something calling behind the  mountains.\"    Soon the quails called again: \"Coyote, you ate your own meat.\"    \"What did you say?\"    \"Oh, nothing. We heard somebody pounding his grinding-stone.\"    So Coyote went on. But at last he began to feel where he had been cut.  Then he knew what the quails meant. He turned back down the trail and  told Quails he would eat them up. He began to chase them. The quails  flew above ground and Coyote ran about under them. At last they got  tired, but Coyote did not because he was so angry.    By and by Quails came to a hole, and one of the keenest-witted picked up  a piece of prickly cholla cactus and pushed it into the hole; then they  all ran in after it. But Coyote dug out the hole and reached them. When  he came to the first quail he said,    \"Was it you who told me I ate my own flesh?\"    Quail said, \"No.\"    So Coyote let him go and he flew away. When Coyote came to the second  quail, he asked the same question. Quail said, \"No,\" and then flew away.  So Coyote asked every quail, until the last quail was gone, and then he  came to the cactus branch. Now the prickly cactus branch was so covered  with feathers that it looked just like a quail. Coyote asked it the same  question, but the cactus branch did not answer. Then Coyote said,    \"I know it was you because you do not answer.\"    So Coyote bit very hard into the hard, prickly branch, and it killed  him.          Coyote and the Fawns  Sia (New Mexico)    Another day when he was travelling around, Coyote met a deer with two  fawns. The fawns were beautifully spotted, and he said to the deer, \"How  did you paint your children? They are so beautiful!\"    Deer replied, \"I painted them with fire from the cedar.\"    \"And how did you do the work?\" asked Coyote.    \"I put my children into a cave and built a fire of cedar in front of it.  Every time a spark flew from the fire it struck my children, making a  beautiful spot.\"    \"Oh,\" said Coyote, \"I will do the same thing. Then I will make my  children beautiful.\"    He hurried to his house and put his children in a cave. Then he built a  fire of cedar in front of it and stood off to watch the fire. But the  children cried because the fire was very hot. Coyote kept calling to  them not to cry because they would be beautiful like the deer. After a  time the crying ceased and Coyote was pleased. But when the fire died  down, he found they were burned to death. Coyote expected to find them  beautiful, but instead they were dead.    Then he was enraged with the deer and ran away to hunt her, but he could  not find her anywhere. He was much distressed to think the deer had  fooled him so easily.          How the Bluebird Got its Color  Pima (Arizona)    A long time ago, the bluebird was a very ugly color. But Bluebird knew  of a lake where no river flowed in or out, and he bathed in this four  times every morning for four mornings. Every morning he sang a magic  song:                   \"There's a blue water. It lies there.                 I went in.                 I am all blue.\"    On the fourth morning Bluebird shed all his feathers and came out of the  lake just in his skin. But the next morning when he came out of the lake  he was covered with blue feathers.    Now all this while Coyote had been watching Bluebird. He wanted to jump  in and get him to eat, but he was afraid of the water. But on that last  morning Coyote said,    \"How is it you have lost all your ugly color, and now you are blue and  gay and beautiful? You are more beautiful than anything that flies in  the air. I want to be blue, too.\" Now Coyote at that time was a bright  green.    \"I only went in four times on four mornings,\" said Bluebird. He taught  Coyote the magic song, and he went in four times, and the fifth time he  came out as blue as the little bird.    Then Coyote was very, very proud because he was a blue coyote. He was so  proud that as he walked along he looked around on every side to see if  anybody was looking at him now that he was a blue coyote and so  beautiful. He looked to see if his shadow was blue, too. But Coyote was  so busy watching to see if others were noticing him that he did not  watch the trail. By and by he ran into a stump so hard that it threw him  down in the dirt and he was covered with dust all over. You may know  this is true because even to-day coyotes are the color of dirt.          Coyote's Eyes  Pima (Arizona)    When Coyote was travelling about one day, he saw a small bird. The bird  was hopping about contentedly and Coyote thought,    \"What a beautiful bird. It moves about so gracefully.\"    He drew nearer to the bird and asked, \"What beautiful things are you  working with?\" but the bird could not understand Coyote. After a while  the bird took out his two eyes and threw them straight up into the air,  like two stones. It looked upward but had no eyes. Then the bird said,    \"Come, my eyes. Come quickly, down into my head.\" The eyes fell down  into the bird's head, just where they belonged, but were much brighter  than before.    Coyote thought he could brighten his eyes. He asked the bird to take out  his eyes. The bird took out Coyote's eyes, held them for a moment in his  hands, and threw them straight up into the air. Coyote looked up and  called,    \"Come back, my eyes. Come quickly.\" They at once fell back into his head  and were much brighter than before. Coyote wanted to try it again, but  the bird did not wish to. But Coyote persisted. Then the bird said,    \"Why should I work for you, Coyote? No, I will work no more for you.\"  But Coyote still persisted, and the bird took out his eyes and threw  them up. Coyote cried,    \"Come, my eyes, come back to me.\"    But his eyes continued to rise into the air, and the bird began to go  away. Coyote began to weep. But the bird was annoyed, and called back,    \"Go away now. I am tired of you. Go away and get other eyes.\"    But Coyote refused to go and entreated the bird to find eyes for him. At  last the bird gathered gum from a pinon tree and rolled it between his  hands and put it in Coyote's eye holes, so that he could see. But his  eyes had been black and very bright. His new eyes were yellow.    \"Now,\" said the bird, it \"go away. You cannot stay here any longer.\"          Coyote and the Tortillas  Pima (Arizona)    Once upon a time, a river rose very high and spread all over the land.  An Indian woman was going along the trail by the river side with a  basket of tortillas on her head, but she was wading in water up to her  waist. Now Coyote was afraid of the water, so he had climbed into a  cottonwood tree. When the woman came up the trail, Coyote called,    \"Oh, come to this tree and give me some of those nice tortillas.\"    The woman said, \"No. I can't give them to you; they are for somebody  else.\"    \"If you do not come here I will shoot you,\" said Coyote, and the woman  really thought he had a bow. So she came to the tree and said, \"You must  come down and get them. I can't climb trees.\"    Coyote came down as far as he dared, but he was afraid of the deep  water. The woman laughed at him. She said, \"Just see how shallow it is.  It's only up to my ankles.\" But she was standing on a big stump. Coyote  looked at the water. It seemed shallow and safe enough, so he jumped.  But the water was deep and he was drowned. Then the woman went on up the  trail.          Coyote as a Hunter  Sia (New Mexico)    Coyote travelled a long distance and in the middle of the day it was  very hot. He sat down and rested, and thought, as he looked up to Tinia,  \"How I wish the Cloud People would freshen my path and make it cool.\"    In just a little while the Cloud People gathered over the trail Coyote  was following and he was glad that his path was to be cool and shady.    After he travelled some distance further, he sat down again and looking  upward said, \"I wish the Cloud People would send rain. My road would be  cooler and fresher.\" In a little while a shower came and Coyote was  contented.    But in a short time he again sat down and wished that the road could be  very moist, that it would be fresh to his feet, and almost immediately  the trail was as wet as though a river had passed over it. Again Coyote  was contented.    But after a while he took his seat again. He said to himself, \"I guess I  will talk again to the Cloud People.\" Then he looked up and said to  them,    \"I wish for water over my road-water to my elbows, that I may travel on  my hands and feet in the cool waters; then I shall be refreshed and  happy.\"    In a short time his road was covered with water, and he moved on. But  again he wished for something more, and said to the Cloud People,    \"I wish much for water to my shoulders. Then I will be happy and  contented.\"    In a moment the waters arose as he wished, yet after a while he looked  up and said, \"If you will only give me water so high that my eyes, nose,  mouth and ears are above it, I will be happy. Then indeed my road will  be cool.\"    But even this did not satisfy him, and after travelling a while longer  he implored the Cloud People to give him a river that he might float  over the trail, and immediately a river appeared and Coyote floated down  stream. Now he had been high in the mountains and wished to go to Hare  Land.    After floating a long distance, he at last came to Hare Land and saw  many Hares a little distance off, on both sides of the river. Coyote lay  down in the mud as though he were dead and listened. Soon a woman  ka-wate (mephitis) came along with a vase and a gourd for water.    She said, \"Here is a dead coyote. Where did he come from? I guess from  the mountains above. I guess he fell into the water and died.\"    Coyote looked up and said, \"Come here, woman.\"    She said, \"What do you want?\"    Coyote said, \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#16)"],[1,"British friends.    After a while General Botha rode up. He offered a far from cordial  welcome to the deputation.    Dr. Scholtz produced a piece of paper and said Lord Roberts had sent  him to enquire why Botha insisted on more unnecessary bloodshed, and  why he did not come in to make peace, and that sort of thing.    Botha asked if Scholtz held an authoritative letter or document from  the English general, to which the Doctor replied in the negative.    Smit now suggested that he should be allowed to see Mr. Kruger, but  Botha declared, with considerable emphasis, \"Look here, your conduct  is nothing less than execrable, and I shall not allow you to see Mr.  Kruger. You are a couple of contemptible scoundrels, and as for Dr.  Scholtz, his certificate looks rather dubious. You will go back and  give the following message to Lord Roberts:--         \"That this is not the first time messages of this       description are sent to me in an unofficial manner; that       these overtures have also sometimes been made in an       insulting form, but always equally unofficially. I have to       express my surprise at such tactics on the part of a man in       Lord Roberts' position. His Lordship may think that our       country is lost to us, but I shall do my duty towards it all       the same. They can shoot me for it or imprison me, or banish       me, but my principles and my character they cannot assail.\"    One could plainly see that the conscience-stricken messengers winced  under the reproach. Not another word was said, and the noble trio  turned on their heels and took their white flag back to Pretoria.    Whether Botha was right in allowing these \"hands-uppers\" to return, is  a question I do not care to discuss, but many burghers had their own  opinion about it. Still, if they had been detained by us and shot for  high treason, what would not have been said by those who did not  hesitate to send our own unfaithful burghers to us to induce us to  surrender.    I cannot say whether Lord Roberts was personally responsible for the  sending of these messengers, but that such action was extremely  improper no one can deny. It was a specially stupendous piece of  impudence on the part of these men, J. S. Smit and J. F. de Beer,  burghers both, and highly placed officials of the S. A. Republic. They  had thrown down their arms and sworn allegiance to an enemy, thereby  committing high treason in the fullest sense of the word. They now  came through the fighting lines of their former comrades to ascertain  from the commanders of the republican army why the whole nation did  not follow their example, why they would not surrender their liberty  and very existence as a people and commit the most despicable act  known to mankind.    \"Pretoria was in British hands!\" As if, forsooth, the existence of our  nationality began and ended in Pretoria! Pretoria was after all only a  village where \"patriots\" of the Smit and de Beer stamp had for years  been fattening on State funds, and, having filled their pockets by  means of questionable practices, had helped to damage the reputation  of a young and virile nation.    Not only had they enjoyed the spoils of high office in the State  Service offices, to which a fabulous remuneration was attached, but  they belonged to the Boer aristocracy, members of honourable families  whose high birth and qualities had secured for them preference over  thousands of other men and the unlimited confidence of the Head of  State. Little wonder these gentlemen regarded the fall of Pretoria as  the end of the war!    The battle continued the whole day; it was fiercest on our left flank,  where General French and his cavalry charged the positions of the  Ermelo and Bethel burghers again and again, each time to be repulsed  with heavy losses. Once the lancers attacked so valiantly that a  hand-to-hand fight ensued. The commandant of the Bethel burghers  afterwards told me that during the charge his kaffir servant got among  the lancers and called upon them to \"Hands up!\" The unsophisticated  native had heard so much about \"hands up,\" and \"hands-uppers,\" that he  thought the entire English language consisted of those two simple  words, and when one lancer shouted to him \"Hands up,\" he echoed \"Hands  up.\" The British cavalryman thrust his lance through the nigger's  arm, still shouting \"Hands up,\" the black man retreating, also  vociferously shrieking \"Hands up, boss; hands up!\"    When his master asked him why he had shouted \"Hands up\" so  persistently though he was running away, he answered: \"Ah, boss, me  hear every day people say, 'Hands up;' now me think this means kaffir  'Soebat' (to beg). I thought it mean, 'Leave off, please,' but the  more I shouted 'Hands up' English boss prod me with his assegai all  the same.\"    On our right General De la Rey had an equally awkward position; the  British here also made several determined attempts to turn his flank,  but were repulsed each time. Once during an attack on our right, their  convoy came so close to our position that our artillery and our  Mausers were enabled to pour such a fire into them that the mules  drawing the carts careered about the veldt at random, and the greatest  confusion ensued. British mules were \"pro-Boer\" throughout the War.  The ground, however, was not favourable for our operations, and we  failed to avail ourselves of the general chaos. Towards the evening of  the second day General Tobias Smuts made an unpardonable blunder in  falling back with his commandos. There was no necessity for the  retreat; but it served to show the British that there was a weak point  in our armoury. Indeed, the following day the attack in force was made  upon this point. The British had meantime continued pouring in  reinforcements, men as well as guns.    About two o clock in the afternoon Smuts applied urgently for  reinforcements, and I was ordered by the Commandant-General to go to  his position. A ride of a mile and a half brought us near Smuts; our  horses were put behind a \"randje,\" the enemy's bullets and shells  meantime flying over their heads without doing much harm. We then  hurried up on foot to the fighting line, but before we could reach the  position General Smuts and his burghers had left it. At first I was  rather in the dark as to what it all meant until we discovered that  the British had won Smuts' position, and from it were firing upon us.  We fell down flat behind the nearest \"klips\" and returned the fire,  but were at a disadvantage, since the British were above us. I never  heard where General Smuts and his burghers finally got to. On our left  we had Commandant Kemp with the Krugersdorpers; on the right  Field-Cornet Koen Brits. The British tried alternately to get through  between one of my neighbours and myself, but we succeeded,  notwithstanding their fierce onslaught, in turning them back each  time. All we could do, however, was to hold our own till dark. Then  orders were given to \"inspan\" all our carts and other conveyances as  the commandos would all have to retire.    I do not know the extent of the British losses in that engagement. My  friend Conan Doyle wisely says nothing about them, but we knew they  had suffered very severely indeed. Our losses were not heavy; but we  had to regret the death of brave Field-Cornet Roelf Jansen and some  other plucky burghers. Dr. Doyle, referring to the engagement, says:    \"'The two days' prolonged struggle (Diamond Hill) showed that there  was still plenty of fight in the burghers. Lord Roberts had not routed  them,\" etc.    Thus ended the battle of Donkerhoek, and next day our commandos were  falling back to the north.          CHAPTER XVII.    I BECOME A GENERAL.      In our retreat northwards the English did not pursue us. They  contented themselves by fortifying the position we had evacuated  between Donkerhoek and Wonderboompoort. Meantime our commandos  proceeded along the Delagoa Bay Railway until we reached Balmoral  Station, while other little divisions of ours were at Rhenosterkop,  north of Bronkhorst Spruit.    I may state that this general retreat knocked the spirit out of some  of our weaker brethren. Hundreds of Boers rode into Pretoria with the  white flag suspended from their Mauser barrels. In Pretoria there were  many prominent burghers who had readily accepted the new conditions,  and these were employed by the British to induce other Boers within  reach, by manner of all sorts of specious promises, to lay down their  arms. Many more western district Boers quietly returned to their  homes. Luckily, the Boer loves his Mauser too well to part with it,  except on compulsion, and although the majority of these western Boers  handed in their weapons, some retained them.    They retained their weapons by burying them, pacifying the confiding  British officer in charge of the district by handing in rusty and  obsolete Martini-Henris or a venerable blunderbuss which nobody had  used since ancestral Boer shot lions with it in the mediaeval days of  the first great trek. The buried Mausers came in very useful  afterwards.    About this time General Buller entered the Republic from the Natal  side, and marched with his force through the southern districts of  Wakkerstroom, Standerton, and Ermelo. Hundreds of burghers remained on  their farms and handed their weapons to the British. In some  districts, for instance, at Standerton, the commandant and two out of  his three field-cornets surrendered. Thus, not only were some  commandos without officers, but others entirely disappeared from our  army. Still, at the psychological moment a Joshua would appear, and  save the situation, as, for instance, in the Standerton district,  where Assistant-Field-Cornet Brits led a forlorn hope and saved a  whole commando from extinction. The greatest mischief was done by many  of our landdrosts, who, after having surrendered, sent out  communications to officers and"]]]
