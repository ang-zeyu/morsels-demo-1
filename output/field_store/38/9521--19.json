It is most valuable       for horses and mules which are not at heavy work, such as brood       mares and work horses during the slack season. With plenty of       grain on the cornstalks, horses will keep in good condition on       a ration of 20 pounds of silage and 10 pounds of hay for each       1,000 pounds of live weight.      PREPARATION OF FEEDS.    Feed is prepared for any of the following reasons: To render it more  easily eaten; to make it more digestible; to economize in amount; to  give it some new property; and to preserve it. We have already spoken of  the preparation of drying, and need not revert to this again, as it only  serves to preserve the different feeds. Drying does, however, change  some of the properties of feed, _i. e._, removes the laxative tendency  of most of them.    The different grains are more easily eaten when ground, crushed, or even  boiled. Rye or wheat should never be given whole, and even of corn it is  found that there is less waste when ground, and, in common with all  other grains, it is more easily digested than when fed whole.    Hay and fodder are economized when cut in short pieces. Not only will  the horse eat the necessary quantity in a shorter time, but it will be  found that there is less waste, and the mastication of the grains (whole  or crushed) fed with them is insured.    Reference has already been made to those horses that bolt their feed,  and we need only remark here that the consequences of such ravenous  eating may be prevented if the grains are fed with cut hay, straw, or  fodder. Long or uncut hay should also be fed, even though a certain  quantity of hay or straw is cut and fed mixed with grain.    One objection to feeding cut hay mixed with ground or crushed grains,  and wetted, must not be overlooked during the hot months. Such feed is  liable to undergo fermentation if not fed directly after it is mixed;  even the mixing trough, unless frequently scalded and cleaned, becomes  sour and enough of its scrapings are given with the feed to produce  flatulent (wind) colic. A small quantity of salt should always be mixed  with such feed. Bad hay should never be cut simply because it insures a  greater consumption of it; bad feeds are dear at any price, and should  never be fed.    The advantage of boiling roots has been mentioned. Not only does this  render them less liable to produce digestive disorders, but it also  makes them clean. Boiling or steaming grains is to be recommended when  the teeth are poor, or when the digestive organs are weak.      DISEASES OF THE TEETH.    _Dentition._--This covers the period during which the young horse is  cutting his teeth--from birth to the age of 5 years. With the horse more  difficulty is experienced in cutting the second or permanent teeth than  with the first or milk teeth. There is a tendency among farmers and many  veterinarians to pay too little attention to the teeth of young horses.  Percivall relates an instance illustrative of this that is best told in  his own words:         I was requested to give my opinion concerning a horse, then in       his fifth year, who had fed so sparingly for the last       fortnight, and so rapidly declined in condition in consequence,       that his owner, a veterinary surgeon, was under no light       apprehensions about his life. He had himself examined his mouth       without having discovered any defect or disease, though another       veterinary surgeon was of opinion that the difficulty or       inability manifested in mastication, and the consequent       cudding, arose from preternatural bluntness of the surfaces of       the molar teeth, which were, in consequence, filed, but without       beneficial result. It was after this that I saw the horse, and       I confess I was, at my first examination, quite as much at a       loss to offer any satisfactory interpretation as others had       been. While meditating, however, after my inspection, on the       apparently extraordinary nature of the case, it struck me that       I had not seen the tusks. I went back into the stable and       discovered two little tumors, red and hard, in the situation of       the inferior tusks, which, when pressed, gave the animal       insufferable pain. I instantly took out my pocketknife and made       crucial incisions through them both, down to the coming teeth,       from which moment the horse recovered his appetite and, by       degrees, his wonted condition.    The mouths of young horses should be examined from time to time to see  whether one or more of the milk teeth are not remaining too long,  causing the second teeth to grow in crooked, in which case the first  teeth should be removed with the forceps.    _Irregularities of teeth._--There is a fashion of late years, especially  in large cities, to have horses' teeth regularly \"floated,\" or \"rasped,\"  by \"veterinary dentists.\" In some instances this is very beneficial,  while in most cases it is entirely unnecessary. From the character of  the feed, the rubbing, or grinding, surface of the horse's teeth should  be rough. Still, we must remember that the upper jaw is somewhat wider  than the lower, and that, from the fact of the teeth not being perfectly  apposed, a sharp ridge is left unworn on the inside of the lower molars  and on the outside of the upper, which may excoriate the tongue or  cheeks to a considerable extent. This condition may readily be felt by  the hand, and these sharp ridges when found should be rasped down by a  guarded rasp. In some instances the first or last molar tooth is  unnaturally long, owing to the fact that its fellow in the opposite jaw  has been lost or does not close perfectly against it. Should it be the  last molar that is thus elongated, it will require the aid of the  veterinary surgeon, who has the necessary forceps or chisel for cutting  it. The front molar may be rasped down, if much patience is taken. In  decay of the teeth it is quite common to find the tooth corresponding to  the decayed one on the opposite jaw very much elongated, sometimes to  such an extent that the mouth can not be perfectly closed. Such teeth  must also be shortened by the tooth forceps, chisel, tooth saw, or rasp.  In all instances in which horses \"quid\" their feed, if they are  slobbering, or evince pain in mastication, shown by holding the head to  one side while chewing, the teeth should be carefully examined. Horses  whose teeth have unduly sharp edges are liable to drive badly; they pull  to one side, do not bear on the bit, or bear on too hard and \"big,\" toss  the head, and start suddenly when a tender spot is touched. If, as is  mostly the case, all the symptoms are referable to sharp corners or  projections, these must be removed by the rasp. If decayed teeth ere  found, or other serious difficulty detected, or if the cause of the  annoying symptoms is not discovered, an expert should be called.      [Illustration: PLATE IV.    AGE OF HORSES AS INDICATED BY TEETH.

Toothache is  to be discovered in the horse by the pain expressed by him while feeding  or drinking cold water. I have seen horses, affected with toothache,  that would suddenly stop chewing, throw the head to one side, and  slightly open the mouth. They behave as though some sharp body had  punctured the mouth. If upon examination, no foreign body is found, we  must then carefully examine each tooth. If this can not be done with the  hand in the mouth, we can, in most instances, discover the aching tooth  by pressing each tooth from without. By tapping the teeth in succession  with a hard object, such as a small hammer, the one that is tender may  be identified. The horse will flinch when the sore tooth is pressed or  tapped upon. In most cases there is nothing to be done but extract the  decayed tooth, and this, of course, is to be attempted by the  veterinarian only.    _Deformity._--There is a deformity, known as parrot-mouth, that  interferes with prehension, mastication, and, indirectly, with  digestion. The upper incisors project in front of and beyond the lower  ones. The teeth of both jaws become unusually long, as they are not worn  down by friction. Such horses experience much difficulty in grazing.  Little can be done except to examine the teeth occasionally, and if  those of the lower jaw become so long that they bruise the \"bars\" of the  upper jaw, they must be shortened by the rasp or saw. Horses with this  deformity should never be left entirely at pasture.    The method of determining the age of a horse by the teeth is illustrated  in Plate IV.      DISEASES OF THE MOUTH.      LAMPAS.    Lampas is the name given to a swelling of the mucous membrane covering  the hard palate and projecting in a more or less prominent ridge  immediately behind the upper incisors. The hard palate is composed of  spongy tissue that fills with blood when the horse is feeding, which  causes the ridges to become prominent, and they then help to keep feed  from dropping from the mouth. This swelling is entirely natural and  occurs in every healthy horse. Where there is some irritation in the  mouth, as in stomatitis or during teething, the prominence of the hard  palate may persist, owing to the increased blood supply. In such cases  the cause of the irritation should be nought for and removed. By way of  direct treatment, slight scarification is the most that will be  required. Burning the lampas is barbarous and injurious, and it should  never be tolerated.    It is a quite common opinion among owners of horses and stablemen that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

How many a year has passed[27],      Though we are still so young, since we have met,      Which I have worn in widowhood of heart.      He loved me not: yet he seems little changed--      Changed to me only--would the change were mutual!      He speaks not--scarce regards me--not a word,                      240      Nor look--yet he _was_ soft of voice and aspect,      Indifferent, not austere. My Lord!        _Sar._                            Zarina!        _Zar._ No, _not_ Zarina--do not say Zarina.      That tone--That word--annihilate long years,      And things which make them longer.        _Sar._                             'Tis too late      To think of these past dreams. Let's not reproach--      That is, reproach me not--for the _last_ time----        _Zar._ And _first_, I ne'er reproached you.        _Sar._                                     'Tis most true;      And that reproof comes heavier on my heart      Than----But our hearts are not in our own power.                  250        _Zar._ Nor hands; but I gave both.        _Sar._                            Your brother said      It was your will to see me, ere you went      From Nineveh with----(_He hesitates_.)        _Zar._               Our children: it is true.      I wish to thank you that you have not divided      My heart from all that's left it now to love--      Those who are yours and mine, who look like you,      And look upon me as you looked upon me      Once----but _they_ have not changed.        _Sar._                                Nor ever will.      I fain would have them dutiful.        _Zar._                         I cherish      Those infants, not alone from the blind love                       260      Of a fond mother, but as a fond woman.      They are now the only tie between us.        _Sar._                               Deem not      I have not done you justice: rather make them      Resemble your own line than their own Sire.      I trust them with you--to you: fit them for      A throne, or, if that be denied----You have heard      Of this night's tumults?        _Zar._                  I had half forgotten,      And could have welcomed any grief save yours,      Which gave me to behold your face again.        _Sar._ The throne--I say it not in fear--but 'tis                  270      In peril: they perhaps may never mount it:      But let them not for this lose sight of it.      I will dare all things to bequeath it them;      But if I fail, then they must win it back      Bravely--and, won, wear it wisely, not as I[ag]      Have wasted down my royalty.        _Zar._                      They ne'er      Shall know from me of aught but what may honour      Their father's memory.        _Sar._                 Rather let them hear      The truth from you than from a trampling world.      If they be in adversity, they'll learn                             280      Too soon the scorn of crowds for crownless Princes,      And find that all their father's sins are theirs.      My boys!--I could have borne it were I childless.        _Zar._ Oh! do not say so--do not poison all      My peace left, by unwishing that thou wert      A father. If thou conquerest, they shall reign,      And honour him who saved the realm for them,      So little cared for as his own; and if----        _Sar._ 'Tis lost, all Earth will cry out, \"thank your father!\"      And they will swell the echo with a curse.                         290        _Zar._ That they shall never do; but rather honour      The name of him, who, dying like a king,      In his last hours did more for his own memory      Than many monarchs in a length of days,      Which date the flight of time, but make no annals.        _Sar._ Our annals draw perchance unto their close;      But at the least, whate'er the past, their end      Shall be like their beginning--memorable.        _Zar._ Yet, be not rash--be careful of your life,      Live but for those who love.        _Sar._                       And who are they?                     300      A slave, who loves from passion--I'll not say      Ambition--she has seen thrones shake, and loves;      A few friends who have revelled till we are      As one, for they are nothing if I fall;      A brother I have injured--children whom      I have neglected, and a spouse----        _Zar._                             Who loves.        _Sar._ And pardons?        _Zar._               I have never thought of this,      And cannot pardon till I have condemned.        _Sar._ My wife!        _Zar._          Now blessings on thee for that word!      I never thought to hear it more--from thee.                        310        _Sar._ Oh! thou wilt hear it from my subjects. Yes--      These slaves whom I have nurtured, pampered, fed,      And swoln with peace, and gorged with plenty, till      They reign themselves--all monarchs in their mansions--      Now swarm forth in rebellion, and demand      His death, who made their lives a jubilee;      While the few upon whom I have no claim      Are faithful! This is true, yet monstrous.        _Zar._                                    'Tis      Perhaps too natural; for benefits      Turn poison in bad minds.        _Sar._                    And good ones make                       320      Good out of evil.

Be satisfied--you are not all abandoned.        _Sar._ My life insures me that. How long, bethink you,      Were not I yet a king, should I be mortal;      That is, where mortals _are_, not where they must be?        _Zar._ I know not. But yet live for my--that is,      Your children's sake!        _Sar._                My gentle, wronged Zarina!      I am the very slave of Circumstance                                330      And Impulse--borne away with every breath!      Misplaced upon the throne--misplaced in life.      I know not what I could have been, but feel      I am not what I should be--let it end.      But take this with thee: if I was not formed      To prize a love like thine, a mind like thine,      Nor dote even on thy beauty--as I've doted      On lesser charms, for no cause save that such      Devotion was a duty, and I hated      All that looked like a chain for me or others                      340      (This even Rebellion must avouch); yet hear      These words, perhaps among my last--that none      E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not      To profit by them--as the miner lights      Upon a vein of virgin ore, discovering      That which avails him nothing: he hath found it,      But 'tis not his--but some superior's, who      Placed him to dig, but not divide the wealth      Which sparkles at his feet; nor dare he lift      Nor poise it, but must grovel on, upturning                        350      The sullen earth.        _Zar._            Oh! if thou hast at length      Discovered that my love is worth esteem,      I ask no more--but let us hence together,      And _I_--let me say _we_--shall yet be happy.      Assyria is not all the earth--we'll find      A world out of our own--and be more blessed      Than I have ever been, or thou, with all      An empire to indulge thee.                                _Enter_ SALEMENES.        _Sal._                    I must part ye--      The moments, which must not be lost, are passing.        _Zar._ Inhuman brother! wilt thou thus weigh out                   360      Instants so high and blest?        _Sal._                      Blest!        _Zar._                             He hath been      So gentle with me, that I cannot think      Of quitting.        _Sal._       So--this feminine farewell      Ends as such partings end, in _no_ departure.      I thought as much, and yielded against all      My better bodings. But it must not be.        _Zar._ Not be?        _Sal._         Remain, and perish----        _Zar._                               With my husband----        _Sal._ And children.        _Zar._                Alas!        _Sal._                       Hear me, sister, like      _My_ sister:--all's prepared to make your safety      Certain, and of the boys too, our last hopes;                      370      'Tis not a single question of mere feeling,      Though that were much--but 'tis a point of state:      The rebels would do more to seize upon      The offspring of their sovereign, and so crush----        _Zar._ Ah! do not name it.        _Sal._                      Well, then, mark me: when      They are safe beyond the Median's grasp, the rebels      Have missed their chief aim--the extinction of      The line of Nimrod. Though the present King      Fall, his sons live--for victory and vengeance.        _Zar._ But could not I remain, alone?        _Sal._                                What! leave                  380      Your children, with two parents and yet orphans--      In a strange land--so young, so distant?        _Zar._                                   No--      My heart will break.        _Sal._               Now you know all--decide.        _Sar._ Zarina, he hath spoken well, and we      Must yield awhile to this necessity.      Remaining here, you may lose all; departing,      You save the better part of what is left,      To both of us, and to such loyal hearts      As yet beat in these kingdoms.        _Sal._                         The time presses.        _Sar._ Go, then. If e'er we meet again, perhaps                    390      I may be worthier of you--and, if not,      Remember that my faults, though not atoned for,      Are _ended_. Yet, I dread thy nature will      Grieve more above the blighted name and ashes      Which once were mightiest in Assyria--than----      But I grow womanish again, and must not;      I must learn sternness "]]]
