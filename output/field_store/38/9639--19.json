The  basis on which such ideas as these are built is not to be narrowed  down to poetic fancy and transformed metaphor. They rest upon a  broad philosophy of nature; early and crude, indeed, but thoughtful,  consistent, and quite really and seriously meant.\"(1)      (1) Primtive Culture, i. 285.      For the sake of illustration, some minor examples must next be given  of this confusion between man and other things in the world, which  will presently be illustrated by the testimony of a powerful and long  diffused set of institutions.    The Christian Quiches of Guatemala believe that each of them has a beast  as his friend and protector, just as in the Highlands \"the dog is  the friend of the Maclaines\". When the Finns, in their epic poem the  Kalewala, have killed a bear, they implore the animal to forgive them.  \"Oh, Ot-so,\" chant the singers, \"be not angry that we come near thee.  The bear, the honey-footed bear, was born in lands between sun and moon,  and he died, not by men's hands, but of his own will.\"(1) The Red Men of  North America(2) have a tradition showing how it is that the bear does  not die, but, like Herodotus with the sacred stories of the Egyptian  priests, Mr. Schoolcraft \"cannot induce himself to write it out\".(3) It  is a most curious fact that the natives of Australia tell a similar tale  of THEIR \"native bear\". \"He did not die\" when attacked by men.(4) In  parts of Australia it is a great offence to skin the native bear,  just as on a part of the west coast of Ireland, where seals are  superstitiously regarded, the people cannot be bribed to skin them. In  New Caledonia, when a child tries to kill a lizard, the men warn him to  \"beware of killing his own ancestor\".(5) The Zulus spare to destroy a  certain species of serpents, believed to be the spirits of kinsmen, as  the great snake which appeared when Aeneas did sacrifice was held to  be the ghost of Anchises. Mexican women(6) believed that children born  during an eclipse turn into mice. In Australia the natives believe  that the wild dog has the power of speech; whoever listens to him is  petrified; and a certain spot is shown where \"the wild dog spoke and  turned the men into stone\";(7) and the blacks run for their lives as  soon as the dog begins to speak. What it said was \"Bones\".      (1) Kalewala, in La Finlande, Leouzon Le Duc (1845), vol. ii. p. 100;  cf. also the Introduction.    (2) Schoolcraft, v. 420.

These are minor examples of a form of opinion which is so strong that  it is actually the chief constituent in savage society. That society,  whether in Ashantee or Australia, in North America or South Africa,  or North Asia or India, or among the wilder tribes of ancient Peru,  is based on an institution generally called \"totemism\". This very  extraordinary institution, whatever its origin, cannot have arisen  except among men capable of conceiving kinship and all human  relationships as existing between themselves and all animate and  inanimate things. It is the rule, and not the exception, that savage  societies are founded upon this belief. The political and social conduct  of the backward races is regulated in such matters as blood-feud and  marriage by theories of the actual kindred and connection by descent, or  by old friendship, which men have in common with beasts, plants, the sun  and moon, the stars, and even the wind and the rain. Now, in whatever  way this belief in such relations to beasts and plants may have arisen,  it undoubtedly testifies to a condition of mind in which no hard and  fast line was drawn between man and animate and inanimate nature. The  discovery of the wide distribution of the social arrangements based  on this belief is entirely due to Mr. J. F. M'Lennan, the author of  Primitive Marriage. Mr. M'Lennan's essays (\"The Worship of Plants and  Animals,\" \"Totems and Totemism\") were published in the Fortnightly  Review, 1869-71. Any follower in the footsteps of Mr. M'Lennan has it  in his power to add a little evidence to that originally set forth, and  perhaps to sift the somewhat uncritical authorities adduced.(1)      (1) See also Mr. Frazer's Totemism, and Golden Bough, with chapter on  Totemism in Modern Mythology.      The name \"Totemism\" or \"Totamism\" was first applied at the end of the  last century by Long(1) to the Red Indian custom which acknowledges  human kinship with animals. This institution had already been recognised  among the Iroquois by Lafitau,(2) and by other observers. As to the  word \"totem,\" Mr. Max Muller(3) quotes an opinion that the interpreters,  missionaries, Government inspectors, and others who apply the name  totem to the Indian \"family mark\" must have been ignorant of the Indian  languages, for there is in them no such word as totem. The right word,  it appears, is otem; but as \"totemism\" has the advantage of possessing  the ground, we prefer to say \"totemism\" rather than \"otemism\". The facts  are the same, whatever name we give them. As Mr. Muller says himself,(4)  \"every warrior has his crest, which is called his totem\";(5) and he  goes on to describe a totem of an Indian who died about 1793. We may  now return to the consideration of \"otemism\" or totemism. We approach  it rather as a fact in the science of mythology than as a stage in the  evolution of the modern family system. For us totemism is interesting  because it proves the existence of that savage mental attitude which  assumes kindred and alliance between man and the things in the world.  As will afterwards be seen, totemism has also left its mark on the  mythologies of the civilised races. We shall examine the institution  first as it is found in Australia, because the Australian form of  totemism shows in the highest known degree the savage habit of confusing  in a community of kinship men, stars, plants, beasts, the heavenly  bodies, and the forces of Nature. When this has once been elucidated, a  shorter notice of other totemistic races will serve our purpose.      (1) Voyages and Travels, 1791.    (2) Moeurs des Sauvages (1724), p. 461.    (3) Academy, December 15, 1883.    (4) Selected Essays (1881), ii. 376.    (5) Compare Mr. Max Muller's Contributions to the Science of Mythology.      The society of the Murri or black fellows of Australia is divided into  local tribes, each of which possesses, or used to possess, and hunt  over a considerable tract of country. These local tribes are united by  contiguity, and by common local interests, but not necessarily by blood  kinship. For example, the Port Mackay tribe, the Mount Gambier tribe,  the Ballarat tribe, all take their names from their district. In the  same way we might speak of the people of Strathclyde or of Northumbria  in early English history. Now, all these local tribes contain an  indefinite number of stocks of kindred, of men believing themselves to  be related by the ties of blood and common descent. That descent the  groups agree in tracing, not from some real or idealised human parent,  but from some animal, plant, or other natural object, as the kangaroo,  the emu, the iguana, the pelican, and so forth. Persons of the pelican  stock in the north of Queensland regard themselves as relations of  people of the same stock in the most southern parts of Australia. The  creature from which each tribe claims descent is called \"of the same  flesh,\" while persons of another stock are \"fresh flesh\". A native may  not marry a woman of \"his own flesh\"; it is only a woman of \"fresh\" or  \"strange\" flesh he may marry. A man may not eat an animal of \"his own  flesh\"; he may only eat \"strange flesh\". Only under great stress of need  will an Australian eat the animal which is the flesh-and-blood cousin  and protector of his stock.(1) (These rules of marriage and blood,  however, do not apply among the Arunta of Central Australia, whose  Totems (if Totems they should be called) have been developed on very  different lines.(2)) Clearer evidence of the confusion between man and  beast, of the claiming of kin between man and beast, could hardly be.      (1) Dawson, Aborigines, pp. 26, 27; Howitt and Fison, Kamilaroi and  Kurnai, p. 169.    (2) Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes of Central Australia.      But the Australian philosophy of the intercommunion of Nature goes still  farther than this. Besides the local divisions and the kindred  stocks which trace their descent from animals, there exist among many  Australian tribes divisions of a kind still unexplained. For example,  every man of the Mount Gambier local tribe is by birth either a Kumite  or a Kroki. This classification applies to the whole of the sensible  universe. Thus smoke and honeysuckle trees belong to the division  Kumite, and are akin to the fishhawk stock of men. On the other hand,  the kangaroo, summer, autumn, the wind and the shevak tree belong to  the division Kroki, and are akin to the black cockatoo stock of men. Any  human member of the Kroki division has thus for his brothers the sun,  the wind, the kangaroo, and the rest; while any man of the Kumite  division and the crow surname is the brother of the rain, the thunder,  and the winter.

When the necessity of a thing is generally felt they  usually manage to accomplish it; but they seem to feel pretty  comfortable about waiting till then. I certainly feel more at home among  them than I expected to when I first came over; I suppose it's because  I've had a considerable degree of success. When you're successful you  naturally feel more at home.\"    \"Do you suppose that if I'm successful I shall feel at home?\" Isabel  asked.    \"I should think it very probable, and you certainly will be successful.  They like American young ladies very much over here; they show them  a great deal of kindness. But you mustn't feel too much at home, you  know.\"    \"Oh, I'm by no means sure it will satisfy me,\" Isabel judicially  emphasised. \"I like the place very much, but I'm not sure I shall like  the people.\"    \"The people are very good people; especially if you like them.\"    \"I've no doubt they're good,\" Isabel rejoined; \"but are they pleasant  in society? They won't rob me nor beat me; but will they make themselves  agreeable to me? That's what I like people to do. I don't hesitate to  say so, because I always appreciate it. I don't believe they're very  nice to girls; they're not nice to them in the novels.\"    \"I don't know about the novels,\" said Mr. Touchett. \"I believe the  novels have a great deal but I don't suppose they're very accurate.  We once had a lady who wrote novels staying here; she was a friend  of Ralph's and he asked her down. She was very positive, quite up to  everything; but she was not the sort of person you could depend on  for evidence. Too free a fancy--I suppose that was it. She afterwards  published a work of fiction in which she was understood to have given  a representation--something in the nature of a caricature, as you might  say--of my unworthy self. I didn't read it, but Ralph just handed me  the book with the principal passages marked. It was understood to be  a description of my conversation; American peculiarities, nasal twang,  Yankee notions, stars and stripes. Well, it was not at all accurate;  she couldn't have listened very attentively. I had no objection to her  giving a report of my conversation, if she liked but I didn't like the  idea that she hadn't taken the trouble to listen to it. Of course I talk  like an American--I can't talk like a Hottentot. However I talk, I've  made them understand me pretty well over here. But I don't talk like the  old gentleman in that lady's novel. He wasn't an American; we wouldn't  have him over there at any price. I just mention that fact to show you  that they're not always accurate. Of course, as I've no daughters,  and as Mrs. Touchett resides in Florence, I haven't had much chance  to notice about the young ladies. It sometimes appears as if the young  women in the lower class were not very well treated; but I guess their  position is better in the upper and even to some extent in the middle.\"    \"Gracious,\" Isabel exclaimed; \"how many classes have they? About fifty,  I suppose.\"    \"Well, I don't know that I ever counted them. I never took much notice  of the classes. That's the advantage of being an American here; you  don't belong to any class.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Isabel. \"Imagine one's belonging to an English class!\"    \"Well, I guess some of them are pretty comfortable--especially towards  the top. But for me there are only two classes: the people I trust and  the people I don't. Of those two, my dear Isabel, you belong to the  first.\"    \"I'm much obliged to you,\" said the girl quickly. Her way of taking  compliments seemed sometimes rather dry; she got rid of them as rapidly  as possible. But as regards this she was sometimes misjudged; she was  thought insensible to them, whereas in fact she was simply unwilling to  show how infinitely they pleased her. To show that was to show too much.  \"I'm sure the English are very conventional,\" she added.    \"They've got everything pretty well fixed,\" Mr. Touchett admitted. \"It's  all settled beforehand--they don't leave it to the last moment.\"    \"I don't like to have everything settled beforehand,\" said the girl. \"I  like more unexpectedness.\"    Her uncle seemed amused at her distinctness of preference. \"Well, it's  settled beforehand that you'll have great success,\" he rejoined. \"I  suppose you'll like that.\"    \"I shall not have success if they're too stupidly conventional. I'm not  in the least stupidly conventional. I'm just the contrary. That's what  they won't like.\"    \"No, no, you're all wrong,\" said the old man. \"You can't tell what  they'll like. They're very inconsistent; that's their principal  interest.\"    \"Ah well,\" said Isabel, standing before her uncle with her hands  clasped about the belt of her black dress and looking up and down the  lawn--\"that will suit me perfectly!\"        CHAPTER VII    The two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of the attitude  of the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to  appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present  profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped  her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England. Her gouty  uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having  cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was not warranted  in expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiar taste; she  liked to receive cards. For what is usually called social intercourse  she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find  her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. She  flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the  sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. She had  played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and it was not to be  supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be  kept of her comings and goings. But it is by no means certain that she  did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and  that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in  the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions  to her husband's adopted country. Isabel presently found herself in the  singular situation of defending the British constitution against her  aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this  venerable instrument. Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the  pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old  parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use  of her sharpness. She was very critical herself--it was incidental to  her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as  well, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her  own moral fountains flowing.    \"Now what's your point of view?\" she asked of her aunt. \"When you  criticise everything here you should have a point of view. Yours doesn't  seem to be American--you thought everything over there so disagreeable.  When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!\"    \"My dear young lady,\" said Mrs. Touchett, \"there are as many points of  view in the world as there are people of sense to take them. You may  say that doesn't make them very numerous! American? Never in the world;  that's shockingly narrow. My point of view, thank God, is personal!\"    Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a  tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not  have sounded well for her to say so. On the lips of a person less  advanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchett  such a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance. She  risked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked a  great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a  large licence to extravagance. Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to  chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating  everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges  such a reputation conferred. She accused him of an odious want of  seriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself. Such  slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his  father; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his  father's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, his  fantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted,  and his native country, his charming new-found cousin. \"I keep a band  of music in my ante-room,\" he said once to her. \"It has orders to play  without stopping; it renders me two excellent services. It keeps the  sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, and it makes  the world think that dancing's going on within.\" It was dance-music  indeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shot of Ralph's  band; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air. Isabel often  found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; she would have liked  to pass through the ante-room, as her cousin called it, and enter the  private apartments. It mattered little that he had assured her they were  a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them  and set them in order. It was but half-hospitality to let her remain  outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps  with the ferule of her straight young wit. It must be said that her wit  was exercised to a large extent in self-defence, for her cousin amused  himself with calling her \"Columbia\" and accusing her of a patriotism so  heated that it scorched. He drew a caricature of her in which she was  represented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the  prevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner.
