Amid the thickening  shadows they could see the statues gleam white and motionless.  But Eliza saw other things. She watched in silence presently, and  they watched silently, and the evening fell like a veil that grew  heavier and blacker. And it was night. And the moon came up  above the trees.    \"Oh,\" cried Eliza suddenly, \"here's the dear little boy with the deer  he's coming right for me, bless his heart!\"    Next moment she was screaming, and her screams grew fainter  and there was the sound of swift boots on gravel.    \"Come on!\" cried Gerald; \"she touched it, and then she was  frightened, Just like I was. Run! she'll send everyone in the town  mad if she gets there like that. Just a voice and boots! Run! Run!    They ran. But Eliza had the start of them. Also when she ran on the  grass they could not hear her footsteps and had to wait for the  sound of leather on far-away gravel. Also she was driven by fear,  and fear drives fast.    She went, it seemed, the nearest way, invisibly through the waxing  moonlight, seeing she only knew what amid the glades and groves.    \"I'll stop here; see you tomorrow,\" gasped Mabel, as the loud  pursuers followed Eliza's clatter across the terrace. \"She's gone  through the stable yard.\"    \"The back way,\" Gerald panted as they turned the corner of their  own street, and he and Jimmy swung in past the water-butt.    An unseen but agitated presence seemed to be fumbling with the  locked back-door. The church clock struck the half-hour.    \"Half-past nine,\" Gerald had just breath to say. \"Pull at the ring.  Perhaps it'll come off now.\"    He spoke to the bare doorstep. But it was Eliza, dishevelled,  breathless, her hair coming down, her collar crooked, her dress  twisted and disordered, who suddenly held out a hand a hand that  they could see; and in the hand, plainly visible in the moonlight,  the dark circle of the magic ring.    \"Alf a mo!\" said Eliza's gentleman friend next morning. He was  waiting for her when she opened the door with pail and  hearthstone in her hand. \"Sorry you couldn't come out yesterday.\"    \"So'm I.\" Eliza swept the wet flannel along the top step. \"What did  you do?\"    \"I 'ad a bit of a headache,\" said the gentleman friend. \"I laid down  most of the afternoon. What were you up to?\"    \"Oh, nothing pertickler,\" said Eliza.    \"Then it was all a dream, she said, when he was gone; \"but it'll be  a lesson to me not to meddle with anybody's old ring again in a  hurry.\"    \"So they didn't tell 'er about me behaving like I did,\" said he as he  went \"sun, I suppose like our Army in India. I hope I ain't going to  be liable to it, that's all!\"    Johnson was the hero of the hour. It was he who had tracked the  burglars, laid his plans, and recovered the lost silver. He had not  thrown the stone public opinion decided that Mabel and her aunt  must have been mistaken in supposing that there was a stone at all.  But he did not deny the warning letter. It was Gerald who went out  after breakfast to buy the newspaper, and who read aloud to the  others the two columns of fiction which were the Liddlesby  Observer's report of the facts. As he read every mouth opened  wider and wider, and when he ceased with \"this gifted  fellow-townsman with detective instincts which out-rival those of  Messrs. Lecoq and Holmes, and whose promotion is now assured,\"  there was quite a blank silence.    \"Well,\" said Jimmy, breaking it, \"he doesn't stick it on neither,  does he?\"    \"I feel,\" said Kathleen, \"as if it was our fault as if it was us had told  all these whoppers; because if it hadn't been for you they couldn't  have, Jerry. How could he say all that?\"    \"Well,\" said Gerald, trying to be fair, \"you know, after all, the chap  had to say something. I'm glad I \" He stopped abruptly.    \"You're glad you what?\"    \"No matter,\" said he, with an air of putting away affairs of state.  \"Now, what are we going to do today? The faithful Mabel  approaches; she will want her ring. And you and Jimmy want it  too. Oh, I know. Mademoiselle hasn't had any attention paid to her  for more days than our hero likes to confess.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't always call yourself 'our hero', said Jimmy;  \"you aren't mine, anyhow.\"    \"You're both of you mine,\" said Kathleen hastily.    \"Good little girl.\" Gerald smiled annoyingly. \"Keep baby brother in  a good temper till Nursie comes back.\"    \"You're not going out without us?\" Kathleen asked in haste.    \"I haste away,    'Tis market day,\"    sang Gerald,    \"And in the market there    Buy roses for my fair.    If you want to come too, get your boots on, and look slippy about  it.\"    \"I don't want to come,\" said Jimmy, and sniffed.    Kathleen turned a despairing look on Gerald.    \"Oh, James, James,\" said Gerald sadly, \"how difficult you make it  for me to forget that you're my little brother! If ever I treat you like  one of the other chaps, and rot you like I should Turner or  Moberley or any of my pals well, this is what comes of it.\"    \"You don't call them your baby brothers,\" said Jimmy, and truly.    \"No; and I'll take precious good care I don't call you it again. Come  on, my hero and heroine. The devoted Mesrour is your salaaming  slave.\"    The three met Mabel opportunely at the corner of the square where  every Friday the stalls and the awnings and the green umbrellas  were pitched, and poultry, pork, pottery, vegetables, drapery,  sweets, toys, tools, mirrors, and all sorts of other interesting  merchandise were spread out on trestle tables, piled on carts whose  horses were stabled and whose shafts were held in place by piled  wooden cases, or laid out, as in the case of crockery and hardware,  on the bare flag-stones of the market-place.    The sun was shining with great goodwill, and, as Mabel remarked,  \"all Nature looked smiling and gay.\" There were a few bunches of  flowers among the vegetables, and the children hesitated, balanced  in choice.    \"Mignonette is sweet,\" said Mabel.    \"Roses are roses,\" said Kathleen.    \"Carnations are tuppence,\" said Jimmy; and Gerald, sniffing  among the bunches of tightly-tied tea-roses, agreed that this settled  it.    So the carnations were bought, a bunch of yellow ones, like  sulphur, a bunch of white ones like clotted cream, and a bunch of  red ones like the cheeks of the doll that Kathleen never played  with. They took the carnations home, and Kathleen's green  hair-ribbon came in beautifully for tying them up, which was  hastily done on the doorstep.    Then discreetly Gerald knocked at the door of the drawing-room,  where Mademoiselle seemed to sit all day.    \"Entrez!\" came her voice; and Gerald entered. She was not  reading, as usual, but bent over a sketch-book; on the table was an  open colour-box of un-English appearance, and a box of that  slate-coloured liquid so familiar alike to the greatest artist in  watercolours and to the humblest child with a sixpenny paintbox.    \"With all of our loves,\" said Gerald, laying the flowers down  suddenly before her.    \"But it is that you are a dear child. For this it must that I embrace  you no?\" And before Gerald could explain that he was too old, she  kissed him with little quick French pecks on the two cheeks.    \"Are you painting?\" he asked hurriedly, to hide his annoyance at  being treated like a baby.    \"I achieve a sketch of yesterday,\" she answered; and before he had  time to wonder what yesterday would look like in a picture she  showed him a beautiful and exact sketch of Yalding Towers.    \"Oh, I say ripping!\" was the critic's comment. \"I say, mayn't the  others come and see?\" The others came, including Mabel, who  stood awkwardly behind the rest, and looked over Jimmy's  shoulder.    \"I say, you are clever,\" said Gerald respectfully.    \"To what good to have the talent, when one must pass one's life at  teaching the infants?\" said Mademoiselle.    \"It must be fairly beastly,\" Gerald owned.    \"You, too, see the design?\" Mademoiselle asked Mabel, adding: \"A  friend from the town, yes?\"    \"How do you do?\" said Mabel politely. \"No, I'm not from the town.  I live at Yalding Towers.\"    The name seemed to impress Mademoiselle very much. Gerald  anxiously hoped in his own mind that she was not a snob.    \"Yalding Towers,\" she repeated, \"but this is very extraordinary. Is  it possible that you are then of the family of Lord Yalding?\"    \"He hasn't any family,\" said Mabel; \"he's not married.\"    \"I would say are you how you say? cousin sister  niece?\"    \"No,\" said Mabel, flushing hotly, \"I'm nothing grand at all. I'm  Lord Yalding's housekeeper's niece.\"    \"But you know Lord Yalding, is it not?\"    \"No,\" said Mabel, \"I've never seen him.\"    \"He comes then never to his chateau?\"    \"Not since I've lived there. But he's coming next week.\"    \"Why lives he not there?\" Mademoiselle asked.    \"Auntie says he's too poor,\" said Mabel, and proceeded to tell the  tale as she had heard it in the housekeeper's room: how Lord  Yalding's uncle had left all the money he could leave away from  Lord Yalding to Lord Yalding's second cousin, and poor Lord  Yalding had only just enough to keep the old place in repair, and  to live very quietly indeed somewhere else, but not enough to keep  the house open or to live there; and how he couldn't sell the house  because it was \"in tale .    \"What is it then in tail?\" asked Mademoiselle.    \"In a tale that the lawyers write out,\" said Mabel, proud of her  knowledge and flattered by the deep interest of the French  governess; \"and when once they've put your house in one of their  tales you can't sell it or give it away, but you have to leave it to  your son, even if you don't want to.\"    \"But how his uncle could he be so cruel to leave him the chateau  and no money?\" Mademoiselle asked; and Kathleen and Jimmy  stood amazed at the sudden keenness of her interest in what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#16)"],[1,"the rattling of a carriage over the stones, to be grand or  sublime; which, nevertheless, they must be, if grandeur or sublimity  belong at all to the sensation of loudness. But artillery and lightning  are powerful engines of destruction; and with their power we sympathize,  whenever the sound of them excites any sentiments of sublimity.\"    Now, all this is directly opposed to the doctrine it is meant to support.  It distinctly implies that loudness is so natural and so frequent a result  of the violent contact of bodies, that we sometimes mistakenly ascribe  power to objects, of which we have not correctly distinguished the sounds,  owing to imitation, distance, &c. The occasional mistake implies the  general truth.    Alison, himself, notwithstanding his doctrine of association, is  accordingly led to observe, that \"there are some philosophers who consider  these as the natural signs of passion or affection, and who believe that  it is not from experience, but by means of an original faculty, that we  interpret them: and this opinion is supported by great authorities.\"    He adds the following observations, which, notwithstanding the error they  involve, are too much to the purpose to be omitted here, and which in  reality illustrate a natural and true theory, better than they do his  own:--    \"It is natural, however, to suppose, that in this, as in every case, our  experience should gradually lead to the formation of some general rules,  with regard to this expression.    \"The great divisions of sound are into loud and low, grave and acute, long  and short, increasing and diminishing. The two first divisions are  expressive in themselves: the two last, only in conjunction with others.    \"Loud sound is connected with ideas of power and danger. Many objects in  nature which have such qualities, are distinguished by such sounds; and  this association is farther confirmed from the human voice, in which all  violent and impetuous passions are expressed in loud tones.    \"Low sound has a contrary expression, and is connected with ideas of  weakness, gentleness, and delicacy. This association takes its rise, not  only from the observation of inanimate nature, or of animals, where, in a  great number of cases, such sounds distinguish objects with such  qualities, but particularly from the human voice, where all gentle, or  delicate, or sorrowful affections are expressed by such tones.    \"Grave sound is connected with ideas of moderation, dignity, solemnity,  &c., principally, I believe, from all moderate, or restrained, or  chastened affections being distinguished by such tones in the human voice.    \"Acute sound is expressive of pain, or fear, or surprise, &c., and  generally operates by producing some degree of astonishment. This  association, also, seems principally to arise from our experience of such  connexions in the human voice.    \"Long or lengthened sound seems to me to have no expression in itself, but  only to signify the continuance of that quality which is signified by  other qualities of sound. A loud or a low, a grave or an acute sound  prolonged expresses to us no more than the continuance of the quality  which is generally signified by such sounds.    \"Short or abrupt sound has a contrary expression, and signifies the sudden  cessation of the quality thus expressed.    \"Increasing sound signifies, in the same manner, the increase of the  quality expressed.    \"Decreasing sound signifies the gradual diminution of such qualities.    \"Motion furnishes another sort of beauty.    \"Figure, color, and motion, readily blend in one object, and one general  perception of beauty. In many beautiful objects they all unite, and  render the beauty greater.\"    These characteristics are too universal not to support the doctrine of  natural appropriation and power, of which association is merely a  consequence.    It may be said, that all this chiefly regards mere geometrical forms, not  objects in nature. But, on referring to inanimate objects, it will be  found that they everywhere present these forms.    The round, the simplest form appears to characterize all elementary bodies  and all that are free from compression, to be in fact the most elementary  and the most readily assumed in nature. This form, accordingly, is  presented by the drops of water and of every liquid, by every atom  probably of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote, by the smallest as well as the  largest bodies, even the innumerable celestial orbs.    All the other, the angular forms are presented by inanimate bodies under  compression, or by mineral crystals.    Thus, then, do these simple geometrical forms characterize the simplest  bodies in nature; and it appears that this first kind of beauty is  peculiarly their own. It will, in the sequel, be as clearly seen, that  each of the other classes of natural beings presents beauty of a different  kind, which similarly characterizes it. Hence, no rational theory of  beauty could be formed by writers, who indiscriminatingly jumbled together  the characteristics of all the kinds of beauty, and expected to find them  everywhere.    As, then, from all that has been said, it appears that all the elements of  beauty which have thus been noticed, belong to inanimate beings, and as  this is shown by the passages I have quoted from the best writers, it  seems surprising, not merely that they should not have seen this to be the  case, but, that it should not have led them to observe, that there exists  also a second beauty, of living beings, and third, of thinking beings, as  well as others of the useful, the ornamental, and the intellectual arts  respectively, in each of which some new element was only added to the  characters of the preceding species.    It seems still more surprising that Alison, who deviates so widely from  all fundamental principles, should have actually stumbled upon an  observation of a few of the characteristics of inanimate beings, and  traced them as they pass upward through some living and thinking  beings--whose new characteristics, however, he did not discriminate. He  observes, that \"the greater part of those bodies in nature, which possess  hardness, strength, or durability, are distinguished by angular forms. The  greater part of those bodies, on the contrary, which possess weakness,  fragility, or delicacy, are distinguished by winding or curvilinear forms.  In the mineral kingdom, all rocks, stones, and metals, the hardest and  most durable bodies we know, assume universally angular forms. In the  vegetable kingdom, all strong and durable plants are in general  distinguished by similar forms. The feebler and more delicate race of  vegetables, on the contrary, are mostly distinguished by winding forms. In  the animal kingdom, in the same manner, strong and powerful animals are  generally characterized by angular forms; feeble and delicate animals, by  forms of the contrary kind.\"[13]      SECTION II.    ELEMENTS OF BEAUTY IN LIVING BEINGS.    I have now to show that, in living beings, while the characters of the  first and fundamental beauty, that of inanimate beings, are still  partially continued, new characteristics are added to them.    Plants accordingly possess both rigid parts, like some of those described  in the preceding section, and delicate parts, which, in ascending through  the classes of natural beings from the simplest to the most complex, are  the very first to present to us new and additional characters totally  distinct from those of the preceding class.    I. To begin as nature does, then, we find the trunks and stems of plants,  which are near the ground, resembling most in character the inanimate  bodies from among which they spring. They assume the simplest and most  universal form in nature, the round one; but as growth is their great  function, they extend in height and become cylindrical.    Even the branches, the twigs, and the tendrils, continue this elementary  character; but it is in them, or in the stem when, like them, it is  tender, that such elementary characters give way to the purposes of life,  namely, growth and reproduction, and that we discover the new and  additional characters of beauty which this class presents to us.    II. To render this matter plain, I must observe that the formation of  rings, which unite in tubes, appears to be almost universally the material  condition of growth and reproduction. Every new portion of these tubes,  moreover, and every superadded ring, is less than that which preceded it.    It is from this that results the first characteristic of this second kind  of beauty, namely, fineness or delicacy. Hence, Burke made the possession  of a delicate frame, without any remarkable appearance of strength, his  fifth condition in beauty; and he here erred only from that want of  discrimination which led him to confound together all the conditions of  beauty, and prevented his seeing that they belonged to different genera.    Now, as fine and delicate bodies, which are growing, will shoot in that  direction where space, air, and light, can best be had, and as this, amid  other twigs and tendrils, will greatly vary, so will their productions  rarely continue long in the same straight line, but will, on the contrary,  bend. Hence, the curved or bending form is the second characteristic of  this kind of beauty.    It is worthy of remark, that, as the trunks, stems, twigs, and tendrils,  of plants assume the simplest and most universal form in nature, the round  one, so their more delicate parts have again the tendency to bend into a  similar form.    In the young and feeble branches of plants, it is observed by Alison, that  the bending form is \"beautiful, when we perceive that it is the  consequence of the delicacy of their texture, and of their being  overpowered by the weight of the flower.... In the smaller and feebler  tribe of flowers, as in the violet, the daisy, or the lily of the valley,  the bending"]]]
