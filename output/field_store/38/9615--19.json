They therefore entered the house of one Jean Bernoin, cut  off his ears and further mutilated him, and then bled him to death like  a pig. On coming out of this house they met Jacques Clas, and shot him  in the abdomen, so that his intestines obtruded; pushing them back, he  reached his house in a terrible condition, to the great alarm of his  wife, who was near her confinement, and her children, who hastened to  the help of husband and father. But the murderers appeared on the  threshold, and, unmoved by the cries and tears of the unfortunate wife  and the poor little children, they finished the wounded man, and as the  wife made an effort to prevent them, they murdered her also, treating  her dead body, when they discovered her condition, in a manner too  revolting for description; while a neighbour, called Marie Silliot, who  tried to rescue the children, was shot dead; but in her case they did  not pursue their vengeance any further. They then went into the open  country and meeting Pierre and Jean Bernard, uncle and nephew, one aged  forty-five and the other ten, seized on them both, and putting a pistol  into the hands of the child, forced him to shoot his uncle. In the  meantime the boy's father had come up, and him they tried to constrain  to shoot his son; but finding that no threats had any effect, they ended  by killing both, one by the sword, the other by the bayonet.    \"The reason why they put an end to father and son so quickly was that  they had noticed three young girls of Bagnols going towards a grove of  mulberry trees, where they were raising silk-worms. The men followed  them, and as it was broad daylight and the girls were therefore not  afraid, they soon came up with them. Having first violated them, they  hung them by the feet to a tree, and put them to death in a horrible  manner.\"    All this took place in the reign of Louis the Great, and for the greater  glory of the Catholic religion.    History has preserved the names of the five wretches who perpetrated  these crimes: they were Pierre Vigneau, Antoine Rey, Jean d'Hugon,  Guillaume, and Gontanille.          CHAPTER III      Such crimes, of which we have only described a few, inspired horror in  the breasts of those who were neither maddened by fanaticism nor  devoured by the desire of vengeance. One of these, a Protestant, Baron  d'Aygaliers, without stopping to consider what means he had at his  command or what measures were the best to take to accomplish his object,  resolved to devote his life to the pacification of the Cevennes. The  first thing to be considered was, that if the Camisards were ever  entirely destroyed by means of Catholic troops directed by de Baville,  de Julien, and de Montrevel, the Protestants, and especially the  Protestant nobles who had never borne arms, would be regarded as  cowards, who had been prevented by fear of death or persecution from  openly taking the part of the Huguenots: He was therefore convinced that  the only course to pursue was to get, his co-religionists to put an end  to the struggle themselves, as the one way of pleasing His Majesty and  of showing him how groundless were the suspicions aroused in the minds  of men by the Catholic clergy.    This plan presented, especially to Baron d'Aygaliers, two apparently  insurmountable difficulties, for it could only be carried out by  inducing the king to relax his rigorous measures and by inducing the  Camisards to submit. Now the baron had no connection with the court, and  was not personally acquainted with a single Huguenot chief.    The first thing necessary to enable the baron to begin his efforts was a  passport for Paris, and he felt sure that as he was a Protestant neither  M. de Baville nor M. de Montrevel would give him one. A lucky accident,  however, relieved his embarrassment and strengthened his resolution, for  he thought he saw in this accident the hand of Providence.    Baron d'Aygaliers found one day at the house of a friend a M. de  Paratte, a colonel in the king's army, and who afterwards became  major-general, but who at the time we are speaking of was commandant at  Uzes. He was of a very impulsive disposition, and so zealous in matters  relating to the Catholic religion and in the service of the king, that  he never could find himself in the presence of a Protestant without  expressing his indignation at those who had taken up arms against their  prince, and also those who without taking up arms encouraged the rebels  in their designs. M. d'Aygaliers understood that an allusion was meant  to himself, and he resolved to take advantage of it.    So the next day he paid a visit to M. de Paratte, and instead of  demanding satisfaction, as the latter quite expected, for the rudeness  of his remarks on the previous day, he professed himself very much  obliged for what he had said, which had made such a deep impression on  him that he had made up his mind to give proof of his zeal and loyalty  by going to Paris and petitioning the king for a position at court. De  Paratte, charmed with what he had heard, and enchanted with his convert,  embraced d'Aygaliers, and gave him, says the chronicler, his blessing;  and with the blessing a passport, and wished him all the success that a  father could wish for his son. D'Aygaliers had now attained his object,  and furnished with the lucky safe-conduct, he set out for Paris, without  having communicated his intentions to anyone, not even to his mother.    On reaching Paris he put up at a friend's house, and drew up a statement  of his plan: it was very short and very clear.    \"The undersigned has the honour to point out humbly to His Majesty:    \"That the severities and the persecutions which have been employed by  some of the village priests have caused many people in the country  districts to take up arms, and that the suspicions which new converts  excited have driven a great many of them to join the insurgents. In  taking this step they were also impelled by the desire to avoid  imprisonment or removal from their homes, which were the remedies chosen  to keep them in the old faith. This being the case, he thinks that the  best means of putting an end to this state of things would be to take  measures exactly the contrary of those which produced it, such as  putting an end to the persecutions and permitting a certain number of  those of the Reformed religion to bear arms, that they might go to the  rebels and tell them that far from approving of their actions the  Protestants as a whole wished to bring them back to the right way by  setting them a good example, or to fight against them in order to show  the king and France, at the risk of their lives, that they disapproved  of the conduct of their co-religionists, and that the priests had been  in the wrong in writing to the court that all those of the Reformed  religion were in favour of revolt.\"    D'Aygaliers hoped that the court would adopt this plan; for if they did,  one of two things must happen: either the Camisards, by refusing to  accept the terms offered to them, would make themselves odious to their  brethren (for d'Aygaliers intended to take with him on his mission of  persuasion only men of high reputation among the Reformers, who would be  repelled by the Camisards if they refused to submit), or else; by laying  down their arms and submitting, they would restore peace to the South of  France, obtain liberty of worship, set free their brethren from the  prisons and galleys, and come to the help of the king in his war against  the allied powers, by supplying him in a moment with a large body of  disciplined troops ready to take the field against his enemies; for not  only would the Camisards, if they were supplied with officers, be  available for this purpose, but also those troops which were at the  moment employed in hunting down the Camisards would be set free for this  important duty.    This proposition was so clear and promised to produce such useful  results, that although the prejudice against the Reformers was very  strong, Baron d'Aygaliers found supporters who were at once intelligent  and genuine in the Duke de Chevreuse and the Duke de Montfort, his son.  These two gentlemen brought about a meeting between the baron and  Chamillard, and the latter presented him to the Marechal de Villars, to  whom he showed his petition, begging him to bring it to the notice of  the king; but M. de Villars, who was well acquainted with the obstinacy  of Louis, who, as Baron de Peken says, \"only saw the Reformers through  the spectacles of Madame de Maintenon,\" told d'Aygaliers that the last  thing he should do would be to give the king any hint of his plans,  unless he wished to see them come to nothing; on the contrary, he  advised him to go at once to Lyons and wait there for him, M. de  Villars; for he would probably be passing through that town in a few  days, being almost certain to be appointed governor of Languedoc in  place of M. de Montrevel, who had fallen under the king's displeasure  and was about to be recalled. In the course of the three interviews  which d'Aygaliers had had with M. de Villars, he had become convinced  that de Villars was a man capable of understanding his object; he  therefore followed his advice, as he believed his knowledge of the king  to be correct, and left Paris for Lyons.    The recall of M. de Montrevel had been brought about in the following  manner:--M. de Montrevel having just come to Uzes, learned that Cavalier  and his troops were in the neighbourhood of Sainte-Chatte; he  immediately sent M. de La Jonquiere, with six hundred picked marines and  some companies of dragoons from the regiment of Saint-Sernin, but half  an hour later, it having occurred to him that these forces were not  sufficient, he ordered M. de Foix, lieutenant of the dragoons of  Fimarqon, to join M. de La Jonquiere at Sainte-Chatte with a hundred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#16)"],[1,"ace, not with the empty ceremonial of the court, but with the  consideration which Lady Lochleven owes to everyone who has received  hospitality in her castle.\"    \"Our good hostess mistakes our intention,\" Mary answered, with affected  good-nature; \"and the regent himself can bear witness to the pleasure we  have always had in bringing nearer to us the persons who can recall to  us, even indirectly, our well-beloved father, James V. It will be  therefore unjustly that Lady Douglas will interpret in a manner  disagreeable to herself our surprise at seeing her; and the hospitality  that she offers us so obligingly does not promise us, in spite of her  goodwill, sufficient distractions that we should deprive ourselves of  those that her visits cannot fail to procure us.\"    \"Unfortunately, madam,\" replied Lady Lochleven, whom Mary was keeping  standing before her, \"whatever pleasure I myself derive from these  visits, I shall be obliged to deprive myself of, except at the times I  have mentioned. I am now too old to bear fatigue, and I have, always  been too proud to endure sarcasms.\"    \"Really, Seyton,\" cried Mary, seeming to recollect herself, \"we had not  dreamed that Lady Lochleven, having won her right to a stool at the  court of the king my father, would have need to preserve it in the  prison of the queen his daughter. Bring forward a seat, Seyton, that we  be not deprived so soon, and by a failure of memory on our part, of our  gracious hostess's company; or even,\" went on Mary, rising and pointing  out her own seat to Lady Lochleven, who was making a motion to withdraw,  \"if a stool does not suit you, my lady, take this easy-chair: you will  not be the first member of your family to sit in my place.\"    At this last allusion, which recalled to her Murray's usurpation, Lady  Lochleven was no doubt about to make some exceedingly bitter reply, when  the young man with the dark hair appeared on the threshold, without  being announced, and, advancing towards Lady Lochleven, without saluting  Mary--    \"Madam,\" said he, bowing to the former, \"the boat which took my brother  has just returned, and one of the men in it is charged with a pressing  charge that Lord William forgot to make to you himself.\"    Then, saluting the old lady with the same respect, he immediately went  out of the room, without even glancing at the queen, who, hurt by this  impertinence, turned round to Mary Seyton, and, with her usual calm--    \"What have they told us, Seyton, of injurious rumours which were spread  about our worthy hostess apropos of a child with a pale face and dark  hair? If this child, as I have every reason to believe, has become the  young man who just went out of the room, I am ready to affirm to all the  incredulous that he is a true Douglas, if not for courage, of which we  cannot judge, then for insolence, of which he has just given us proofs.  Let us return, darling,\" continued the queen, leaning on Mary Seyton's  arm; \"for our good hostess, out of courtesy, might think herself obliged  to keep us company longer, while we know that she is impatiently awaited  elsewhere.\"    With these words, Mary went into her bedroom; while the old lady, still  quite stunned with the shower of sarcasms that the queen had rained on  her, withdrew, murmuring, \"Yes, yes, he is a Douglas, and with God's  help he will prove it, I hope.\"    The queen had had strength as long as she was sustained by her enemy's  presence, but scarcely was she alone than she sank into a chair, and no  longer having any witness of her weakness than Mary Seyton, burst into  tears. Indeed, she had just been cruelly wounded: till then no man had  come near her who had not paid homage either to the majesty of her rank  or to the beauty of her countenance. But precisely he, on whom she had  reckoned, without knowing why, with instinctive hopes, insulted her at  one and the same time in her double pride of queen and woman: thus she  remained shut up till evening.    At dinner-time, just as Lady Lochleven had informed Mary, she ascended  to the queen's apartment, in her dress of honour, and preceding four  servants who were carrying the several dishes composing the prisoner's  repast, and who, in their turn, were followed by the old castle steward,  having, as on days of great ceremony, his gold chain round his neck and  his ivory stick in his hand. The servants placed the dishes on the  table, and waited in silence for the moment when it should please the  queen to come out of her room; but at this moment the door opened, and  in place of the queen Mary Seyton appeared.    \"Madam,\" said she on entering, \"her grace was indisposed during the day,  and will take nothing this evening; it will be useless, then, for you to  wait longer.\"    \"Permit me to hope,\" replied Lady Lochleven, \"that she will change her  decision; in any case, see me perform my office.\"    At these words, a servant handed Lady Lochleven bread and salt on a  silver salver, while the old steward, who, in the absence of William  Douglas, fulfilled the duties of carver, served to her on a plate of the  same metal a morsel from each of the dishes that had been brought; then,  this transaction ended.    \"So the queen will not appear to-day?\" Lady Lochleven inquired.    \"It is her Majesty's resolve,\" replied Mary Seyton.    \"Our presence is then needless,\" said the old lady; \"but in any case the  table is served, and if her grace should have need of anything else, she  would have but to name it.\"    With these words, Lady Lochleven, with the same stiffness and the same  dignity with which she had come, withdrew, followed by her four servants  and her steward.    As Lady Lochleven had foreseen, the queen, yielding to the entreaties of  Mary Seyton, came out of her room at last, towards eight o'clock in the  evening, sat down to table, and, served by the only maid of honour left  her, ate a little; then, getting up, she went to the window.    It was one of those magnificent summer evenings on which the whole of  nature seems making holiday: the sky was studded with stars, which were  reflected in the lake, and in their midst, like a more fiery star, the  flame of the chafing-dish shone, burning at the stern of a little boat:  the queen, by the gleam of the light it shed, perceived George Douglas  and Little Douglas, who were fishing. However great her wish to profit  by this fine evening to breathe the pure night air, the sight of this  young man who had so grossly insulted her this very day made such a keen  impression on her that she shut her window directly, and, retiring into  her room, went to bed, and made her companion in captivity read several  prayers aloud; then, not being able to sleep, so greatly was she  agitated, she rose, and throwing on a mantle went again to the window.  The boat had disappeared.    Mary spent part of the night gazing into the immensity of the heavens,  or into the depths of the lake; but in spite of the nature of the  thoughts agitating her, she none the less found very great physical  alleviation in contact with this pure air and in contemplation of this  peaceful and silent night: thus she awoke next day calmer and more  resigned. Unfortunately, the sight of Lady Lochleven, who presented  herself at breakfast-time, to fulfil her duties as taster, brought back  her irritability. Perhaps, however, things would have gone on smoothly  if Lady Lochleven, instead of remaining standing by the sideboard, had  withdrawn after having tasted the various dishes of the courses; but  this insisting on remaining throughout the meal, which was at bottom a  mark of respect, seemed to the queen unbearable tyranny.    \"Darling,\" said she, speaking to Mary Seyton, \"have you already  forgotten that our good hostess complained yesterday of the fatigue she  felt in standing? Bring her, then, one of the two stools which compose  our royal furniture, and take care that it is not the one with the leg  broken\". \"If the furniture of Lochleven Castle is in such bad condition,  madam,\" the old lady replied, \"it is the fault of the kings of Scotland:  the poor Douglases for nearly a century have had such a small part of  their sovereigns' favour, that they have not been able to keep up the  splendour of their ancestors to the level of that of private  individuals, and because there was in Scotland a certain musician, as I  am informed, who spent their income for a whole year in one month.\"    \"Those who know how to take so well, my lady,\" the queen answered, \"have  no need of being given to: it seems to me the Douglases have lost  nothing by waiting, and there is not a younger son of this noble family  who might not aspire to the highest alliances; it is truly vexatious  that our sister the queen of England has taken a vow of virginity; as is  stated.\"    \"Or rather,\" interrupted Lady Lochleven, \"that the Queen of Scotland is  not a widow by her third husband. But,\" continued the old lady,  pretending to recollect herself, \"I do not say that to reproach your  grace. Catholics look upon marriage as a sacrament, and on this head  receive it as often as they can.\"    \"This, then,\" returned Mary, \"is the difference between them and the  Huguenots; for they, not having the same respect for it, think it is  allowed them to dispense with it in certain circumstances.\"    At this terrible sarcasm Lady Lochleven took a step towards Mary Stuart,  holding in her hand the knife which she had just been using to cut off a  piece of meat brought her to taste; but the queen rose up with so great  a calm and with such majesty, that either from involuntary respect or  shame of her first impulse, she let fall the weapon she was holding, and  not finding anything sufficiently strong in reply to express her  feelings, she signed to the servants to follow her, and went out of the  apartment with all the dignity that anger permitted her to summon to her  aid.    Scarcely had Lady Lochleven left the room than the"]]]
