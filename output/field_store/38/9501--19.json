[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#16)"],[1,"Cambridge, was issued by the  Clarendon Press, 1907. It is the standard work upon this subject; and  therein one can find all about everything pertaining to the Greek theatre  and the actual presentation of the play. A useful little guide to the  study of ancient Greece and Italy is Dr. J. B. Mayer's 'Guide to the  Choice of Classical Books,' a small octavo of which a third edition  appeared in 1885. In 1896 a 'new supplement' was published, and this  contains fifty pages of 'Helps to the Study of Ancient Authors'--the best  books which had appeared up to 1896 on the Art, Coins, Law, History,  Philosophy, Religion, Science, Domestic Life, Amusements, and almost  every aspect of life in ancient Rome and Athens. Copies of this  invaluable reference book are probably in most of the public libraries  throughout the kingdom.    With regard to some of the other great world-classics, Boccaccio has been  attempted by many translators, none of whom can be said to have  succeeded, and I forbear to recommend any English version. He is  straightforward and not difficult to read in the original, and it is well  worth learning sufficient Italian to enable one to explore his rich charm  for oneself.    As to Calderon, eight of his plays have been rendered in English by that  prince of translators Edward Fitzgerald, though his version is not, nor  did he pretend it to be, a close translation. Yet it is more in the  spirit of the dramatist than one would deem possible in an English  version of a Spanish author. Six of these plays were first published by  Fitzgerald in 1853, and this volume was reprinted in the series known as  'The King's Classics' in 1903. The complete set of eight may be obtained  in one small octavo volume, in the beautiful 'Eversley' series published  by Macmillan. But you may read seventeen of Calderon's plays, in the  French of Damas Hinard, in the 'Chef d'oeuvre du Theatre Espagnol,'  1841-3, which also includes the works of Lope de Vega: in all five small  octavo volumes--if you are so lucky as to find them.    With regard to Don Quixote, as a boy our book-hunter made more than one  attempt to explore 'the ingenious gentleman' but always gave it up after  proceeding less than half-way through the first volume. It was all so dry  and outlandish, and the version he possessed was written in such stilted  language. There were no notes to his edition, and whole passages and  allusions were beyond his comprehension. Looking back now I more than  suspect that they were beyond the comprehension of the translator as  well. 'Rocinante,' spelt 'Rosinante,' he thought was rather a pretty name  for the Don's charger; but he saw no humour in it until he discovered,  many years later, that _rocin_ means a 'cart-horse' and _ante_,  'previously.' Nor could he see anything amusing in the landlord's boast  that he too had been a knight-errant in his time, roaming the Isles of  Riaran in quest of adventures--until he learnt that this was a city slum,  the resort of thieves and cut-throats. The whole work abounds with local  and topical allusions, and it is essential that our edition be well  supplied with notes. There is one which fulfils this condition and in  addition provides a most scholarly text, more closely approaching the  original than any other which has appeared hitherto. This is the masterly  translation of John Ormsby, which appeared in four octavo volumes in  1885. It contains a valuable history of the work, together with a life of  Cervantes, and the appendices to the last volume contain a bibliography  of the immortal book.    Dante must be read in the original tongue. There is a lofty and spiritual  grandeur in the language of the three great epics which one can never  hope to realise in reading translations, be they never so good.  Nevertheless those versions which are most in favour among students are  of considerable value as commentaries, and are of great assistance in  reading the original. One cannot do better at the outset of one's  acquaintance with the great poet than to procure Dr. J. A. Carlyle's  excellent version of the 'Inferno.' A third edition was published in  1882. It has explanatory notes and a prose translation, in measured,  dignified language, above the text of the original; forming in all  respects a handy and convenient volume. Dr. A. J. Butler's versions of  the 'Purgatory' and 'Paradise' were issued, in octavo, in 1880 and 1885  respectively. Aids to the study of Dante are legion. The fourth edition  of Professor J. Addington Symond's 'Introduction to the Study of Dante'  appeared in 1899; whilst Lord Vernon's 'Readings in Dante,' six octavo  volumes, is said to have occupied that great scholar for more than  twenty-five years of his life.    Goethe is known to English readers chiefly by the immortal _Faust_; and  this work alone has engaged the attention of numerous scholars. A volume  containing seven of Goethe's plays in English was published in Bohn's  Standard Library in 1879. It included Sir Walter Scott's version of  'Goetz von Berlichingen,' the remainder being translated by Miss Swanwick  and E. A. Bowring. Miss Swanwick's 'Faust' is well known and has often  been reprinted; a beautiful edition illustrated by Mr. Gilbert James  appeared in 1906. There is a version, however, which stands far above the  rest, a version which the writer for his part has always considered to  rank with the greatest translations. This is the 'Faust' of Bayard  Taylor, which indeed may be read as a poem in itself. But then Taylor had  advantages possessed by few translators. An American by birth, his mother  was a German, and he spent a part of his life in Germany. From his birth  he was bilinguous; and added to this linguistic advantage were his  profound scholarship and poetic gift. There are numerous editions of his  work, but only one--so far as I am aware, in this country at  least--worthy of its great merit, namely, that which appeared in two  octavo volumes in 1871. It is an edition somewhat hard to obtain.    For Schiller's dramatic works we must have recourse to Coleridge, who has  given us versions of both parts of the 'Wallenstein' and 'William Tell.'  The Poems and Ballads were rendered in English by Sir E. Bulwer Lytton  (Lord Lytton): two volumes, 1844. Heine's short four-line verses do not  lend themselves to translating and though many have attempted it, the  results are almost always a jingle, often approaching doggerel. The prose  works have recently been translated by Mr. C. G. Leland, and the 'Atta  Troll' by Miss Armour, both forming part of a twelve volume edition  published between 1892 and 1905.    The mention of Rabelais conjures up one of those extremely rare instances  where a translation constitutes as great a classic as the original work.  Whether it was the difficulty of translation, or the despair of eclipsing  so notable a success as had been achieved by their predecessor, that  deterred other scholars from making the attempt, we know not; but certain  it is that the version put forth by Sir Thomas Urquhart in 1653 has  remained, and seems likely to remain, the standard representation of the  fantastic 'Doctor in Physick' in this language. Urquhart, that polished  and gifted Scottish d'Artagnan, translated the first three books only;  the last two were added by Motteux, a French refugee, in 1694. Urquhart's  work, 'precise, elegant, and very faithful,' comes as near perfection as  any translation can hope to be. Motteux's rendering was revised by Ozell;  but unfortunately it falls far short of the version of Sir Thomas, who,  with a longer life, might perhaps have undertaken these last two books as  well.    Of these five books of Master Francis Rabelais thus english'd, there  have been, of course, numerous editions. Our book-hunter prefers that  which appeared in three quarto volumes in 1904, with photogravure  illustrations by M. Louis Chalon. Both from a scholarly and a  bibliographical standpoint it is all that can be desired, and one can  have a copy for less than a pound.    Why is it that we all have some acquaintance at least with the Arabian  Nights? What have these purely Eastern tales to do with us? Both  questions may be answered at once. It is because they contain the very  essence of oriental thought, manners, customs, habits, speech, and deeds:  because we can learn from them more of the everyday life of the orient,  both of to-day and of a thousand years ago, than an entire library of  travels can teach us. Surely it is more than mere curiosity that urges us  to know something at least of the manner in which so many millions of our  fellow-beings live.    Who has not read at least some of these glorious tales? Who has not heard  of Sinbad or the Roc, of Scheherazade or of Haroun al Raschid? Truly they  are        'The tales that charm away the wakeful night       In Araby, romances';    Wordsworth himself came early under their spell. He tells how as a young  child        'A precious treasure had I long possessed,       A little yellow, canvas-covered book,       A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;       And, from companions in a new abode,       When first I learnt that this dear prize of mine       Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry--       That there were four large volumes, laden all       With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,       A promise scarcely earthly.'    And so he makes a covenant 'with one not richer than myself' that each  should save up until their joint savings were sufficient to purchase the  complete work. But alas!                          'Through several months,      In spite of all temptation, we preserved      Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,      Nor were we ever masters of our wish.'    There must be few books in the world from which we may learn so much  while being so rapturously entertained. Burton's edition is perhaps the  best known to English readers, though Lane's version is much to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"this church. In the midst of his delighted study he suddenly felt the  attraction of a pair of watchful eyes, and turned to find a peasant  woman gazing fixedly at him. In her strange fascination she had placed  beside her, on the ground, two huge melons and a mammoth cabbage, and  her wizened hands were folded before her, Sunday-fashion. She was a  little witch of a woman, old and bent and brown.    \"Yes, my good gentleman,\" she said, \"I have been looking at you,--five  whole minutes of the clock, and much good it has done me. In these days  of books and such fine learning there is not enough time spent before  our door; and I who pass by it every day, year in, year out, I have  watched well, and only two except yourself have ever studied it. The  foreigners come with red books and look at them more than at the door  itself,--they stay perhaps three minutes, and go off, shaking their wise  heads. Our people, passing every day, see but a door, a place for going  in and coming out.\" She paused for breath.    \"And what do you see?\" asked the traveller.    \"You ask me?\" She smiled wisely. \"But you know, since you are standing  here and looking too. Listen!\" And her old eyes began to gleam. \"I'll  tell you of a time before you were born. I was a child then; and we  marched here every Sunday, other little girls and myself, and we stood  before this door. And the nuns--it was often Sister Mary Dolorosa--told  us the stories of these stones. See! Here is Our Lord Who loves all  mankind, but has to judge us too;--and there is Saint-Trophime. But I  cannot read, Monsieur. An old peasant woman has no time for such fine  things, and you will laugh at me for telling you what you have in your  books,--but I have them all here, here in my heart, and many a time I  too come to refresh my old memory, and to pray. Those pictures tell  great lessons to those that have eyes to see them. Well, well-a-day, I  must pick up my melons and begone, for I have taken up your time and  said too much. But you will excuse it in an old woman who is good for  little else than talking now.\"    They parted in true French fashion, with \"expressions of mutual esteem,\"  and the traveller turned to the portal which was still fulfilling its  ancient mission of teaching and of making beautiful the House of God.  Applied to a severe facade typical of the plainness of Provencal outer  walls, this is one of the noblest works of Mediaevalism, the richest and  most beautiful portal of the South of France; and no others in the Midi,  except those of Saint-Gilles-du-Gard and Moissac, are worthy of  comparison with it. In boldness and intellectuality of conception it  excels many of the northern works and equals the finest of them. For the  builder of the northern portal seems to have held closely to one  architectural form, the beautiful convention of the Gothic style; and  within that door he placed, in a more or less usual way, the subjects  which the Church had sanctioned. In nearly every case the treatment of  the subject is subordinated to the general architectural plan and  symmetry. At Saint-Trophime there was the limit of space, the axiom that  a door must be a door, and doubtless many allowable subjects. But within  these necessary bounds the unknown sculptor recognised few  conventionalities. The usual place for the portrayal of the Last  Judgment, the tympanum, was too small for his conception of the scene;  the pier that divides his door-way was not built to support the statue  of the church's patron saint; he had a multitude of fancies, and instead  of curbing them in some beautiful conventionality of form, as one feels  great northern builders often did, this artist made a frame within which  his ideas found free play, and, forcing conventionality to its will, his  genius justified itself. For not only is the portal as a whole, full of  dignity and true symmetry, but its details are thoughtfully worked out.  They show, with the old scholastic form of his Faith, the grasp of the  unknown master's mind, the intellectuality of his symbolism, and few  portals grow in fascination as this one, few have so interesting an  originality.    [Illustration: RIGHT DETAIL, PORTAL.--ARLES.]    In design it is simple, in execution incomparably rich. The principal  theme of the Last Judgment has Christ seated on a throne as the central  figure, and about him are the symbols of the four Evangelists. This is  the treatment of the tympanum. Underneath, Patriarchs, Saints, Just, and  Condemned form the beautiful frieze. The Apostles are seated; and to  their left is an angel guarding the gates of Paradise against two  Bishops and a crowd of laymen who have yet to fully expiate their sins  in Purgatory. Behind them, naked, with their feet in the flames, are  those condemned to everlasting Hell; and still beyond is a lower depth  where souls are already half-consumed in hideous fires. On the Apostles'  extreme right is the beginning of our human history, the Temptation of  Adam and Eve; and marching toward the holy men, on this same side, is  the long procession of those Redeemed from Adam's fall, clothed in  righteousness. An angel goes before them, and hands a small child--a  ransomed soul--to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The end panels treat the  last phases of the dominant theme;--a mammoth angel in the one weighs  the souls of the dead; and an equally awe-inspiring devil in the other  is preparing to cast two of the Lost into a sea of fire.    The remainder of the portal tells of many subjects, and represents much  of the theological symbolism of its time. Light, graceful columns, with  delicately foliated capitals and bases rich with meaning sculptures,  divide the lower spaces into niches, and in these niches stand statues  of Apostles and of Saints, each having his story, each his peculiar  attributes; and about these chief figures are carved rich designs,  strange animals, and numberless short stories of the Bible. Above there  is a small, subsidiary frieze; below, the pedestals which tell the tale  of those who stand upon them. The figures have life and meaning, if not  a true plasticity; and in this portal there is instruction, variety, and  majesty, wealth of allegory and subtle symbols for those who love  religious mysteries, and splendour of sculpture for those who come in  search of Art.    There are those to whom a simple beauty does not appeal. After the  richness of the portal's carving, the interior of Saint-Trophime is to  them \"far too plain;\" in futile comparison with the Cloister's grace, it  is found \"too severe;\" and one author has written that only \"when the  refulgence of a Mediterranean sun glances through a series of long  lances, ... then and then only does the Cathedral of Saint-Trophime  offer any inducement to linger within its non-impressive walls.\"    It may not be denied that, together with nearly all the Cathedrals of  Provence, this interior has suffered from the addition of inharmonious  styles. The most serious of these is its Gothic choir of the XV century,  which a certain Cardinal Louis Allemand applied to the narrower  Romanesque naves. With irregular ambulatory, chapels of various sizes,  and a general incongruity of plan, this construction has no  architectural importance except that of a prominent place in the  church's worship. The remaining excrescences, Gothic chapels, Ionic  pilasters, elliptical tribune, and the like, are happily hidden along  the side aisles or in the transepts; and during the restoration of  Revoil the naves were relieved of the disfiguring \"improvements\" of the  XVII century, and stand to-day in much of their fine old simplicity.  Beyond the fifth bay, and rising in the tower, is the dome of dignified  Provencal form that rests on the lower arches of the crossing. Small  clerestory windows cast sheets of pale light on the plain piers,  rectangular and heavy, that rise to support a tunnel vault and divide  the church into three naves of great and slender height.    The stern, ascetic style of the XI and XII centuries has given the nave  piers mere small, plain bands as capitals, and for churchly decoration  has allowed only a moulding of acanthus leaves placed high and unnoticed  at the vaulting's base. There is no pleasing detail and no charming  fancy; but a fine, exquisite loftiness, a faultless balance of  proportion, are in this severe interior, and its solemn and majestic  beauty is not surpassed in the Southern Romanesque.    [Illustration: LEFT DETAIL, PORTAL.--ARLES.]    Beyond the south transept, a short passage and a few steps lead to the  Cloisters, the most famous of Provence, perhaps of France. Large,  graceful, and magnificent in wealth of carving, they have yet none of  the poetic charms that linger around many a smaller Cloister. The  vaultings are not more beautiful than other vaults less known; although  they have the help of the great piers, the little, slender columns seem  too light to support so much expanse of roof, and even the church's  tower, square and high, looks dwarfed when seen across the close. The  very spaciousness is solitary, and the long vista of the walks conduces  to vague wonderings rather than to peaceful hours of thought. It has not  the dreamy solitude of Vaison, nor the bright beauty of Elne's little  close, nor any of the sunny cheerfulness that brightens the decaying  walls of Cahors.    [Illustration: THROUGH THE CLOISTER-ARCHES.--ARLES.]    The marvel of these Cloisters is the sculptured decorations of their  piers and columns. Those of the XII century are the richest, but each of  the later builders seems to have vied as best he might, in wealth of  conception and in lavishness of detail, with those who went before, and,  even in enforced re-building, the addition of the Gothic to the  Romanesque has not destroyed the harmony of the effect. In all the  sculptors' schemes, the outer of the double columns were given foliated  patterns or a few,"]]]
