Hic viridem Aeneas frondenti ex ilice metam    constituit signum nautis pater, unde reverti    scirent, et longos ubi circumflectere cursus.    Tum loca sorte legunt, ipsique in puppibus auro    ductores longe effulgent ostroque decori;    cetera populea velatur fronde iuventus,    nudatosque umeros oleo perfilsa nitescit.    Considunt transtris, intentaque brachia remis;    intenti exspectant signum, exsultantiaque haurit    corda pavor pulsans, laudumque arrecta cupido.    Inde, ubi clara dedit sonitum tuba, finibus omnes,    haud mora, prosiluere suis; ferit aethera clamor    nauticus, adductis spumant freta versa lacertis.    Infindunt pariter sulcos, totumque dehiscit    convulsum remis rostrisque tridentibus aequor.    Non tam praecipites biiugo certamine campum    corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere currus,    nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora    concussere iugis pronique in verbera pendent.    Tum plausu fremituque virum studiisque faventum    consonat omne nemus, vocemque inclusa volutant    litora, pulsati colles clamore resultant.      Effugit ante alios primisque elabitur undis    turbam inter fremitumque Gyas; quem deinde Cloanthus    consequitur, melior remis, sed pondere pinus    tarda tenet.  Post hos aequo discrimine Pristis    Centaurusque locum tendunt superare priorem;    et nunc Pristis habet, nunc victam praeterit ingens    Centaurus, nunc una ambae iunctisque feruntur    frontibus, et longa sulcant vada salsa carina.    Iamque propinquabant scopulo metamque tenebant,    cum princeps medioque Gyas in gurgite victor    rectorem navis compellat voce Menoeten:    'Quo tantum mihi dexter abis?  Huc dirige gressum;    litus ama, et laevas stringat sine palmula cautes;    altum alii teneant.'  Dixit; sed caeca Menoetes    saxa timens proram pelagi detorquet ad undas.    'Quo diversus abis?' iterum 'Pete saxa, Menoete!'    cum clamore Gyas revocabat; et ecce Cloanthum    respicit instantem tergo, et propiora tenentem.    Ille inter navemque Gyae scopulosque sonantes    radit iter laevum interior, subitoque priorem    praeterit, et metis tenet aequora tuta relictis.    Tum vero exarsit iuveni dolor ossibus ingens,    nec lacrimis caruere genae, segnemque Menoeten,    oblitus decorisque sui sociumque salutis,    in mare praecipitem puppi deturbat ab alta;    ipse gubernaclo rector subit, ipse magister,    hortaturque viros, clavumque ad litora torquet.    At gravis, ut fundo vix tandem redditus imo est,    iam senior madidaque fluens in veste Menoetes    summa petit scopuli siccaque in rupe resedit.    Ilium et labentem Teucri et risere natantem,    et salsos rident revomentem pectore fluctus.      Hic laeta extremis spes est accensa duobus,    Sergesto Mnestheique, Gyan superare morantem.    Sergestus capit ante locum scopuloque propinquat,    nec tota tamen ille prior praeeunte carina;    parte prior, partem rostro premit aemula Pristis.    At media socios incedens nave per ipsos    hortatur Mnestheus:  'Nunc, nunc insurgite remis,    Hectorei socii, Troiae quos sorte suprema    delegi comites; nunc illas promite vires,    nunc animos, quibus in Gaetulis Syrtibus usi,    Ionioque mari Maleaeque sequacibus undis.    Non iam prima peto Mnestheus, neque vincere certo;    quamquam O!---sed superent, quibus hoc, Neptune, dedisti;    extremos pudeat rediisse; hoc vincite, cives,    et prohibete nefas.'  Olli certamine summo    procumbunt; vastis tremit ictibus aerea puppis,    subtrahiturque solum; tum creber anhelitus artus    aridaque ora quatit, sudor fluit undique rivis.    Attulit ipse viris optatum casus honorem.    Namque furens animi dum proram ad saxa suburguet    interior, spatioque subit Sergestus iniquo,    infelix saxis in procurrentibus haesit.    Concussae cautes, et acuto in murice remi    obnixi crepuere, inlisaque prora pependit.    Consurgunt nautae et magno clamore morantur,    ferratasque trudes et acuta cuspide contos    expediunt, fractosque legunt in gurgite remos.    At laetus Mnestheus successuque acrior ipso    agmine remorum celeri ventisque vocatis    prona petit maria et pelago decurrit aperto.    Qualis spelunca subito commota columba,    cui domus et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi,    fertur in ana volans, plausumque exterrita pennis    dat tecto ingentem, mox aere lapsa quieto    radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas:    sic Mnestheus, sic ipsa fuga secat ultima Pristis    aequora, sic illam fert impetus ipse volantem.    Et primum in scopulo luctantem deserit alto    Sergestum, brevibusque vadis frustraque vocantem    auxilia, et fractis discentem currere remis    Inde Gyan ipsamque ingenti mole Chimaeram    consequitur; cedit, quoniam spoliata magistro est.      Solus iamque ipso superest in fine Cloanthus:    quem petit, et summis adnixus viribus urguet.    Tum vero ingeminat clamor, cunctique sequentem    instigant studiis, resonatque fragoribus aether.    Hi proprium decus et partum indignantur honorem    ni teneant, vitamque volunt pro laude pacisci;    hos successus alit:  possunt, quia posse videntur.    Et fors aequatis cepissent praemia rostris,    ni palmas ponto tendens utrasque Cloanthus    fudissetque preces, divosque in vota vocasset:    Di, quibus imperium est pelagi, quorum aequora curro,    vobis laetus ego hoc candentem in litore taurum    constituam ante aras, voti reus, extaque salsos    porriciam in fluctus et vina liquentia fundam.'    Dixit, eumque imis sub fluctibus audiit omnis    Nereidum Phorcique chorus Panopeaque virgo,    et pater ipse manu magna Portunus euntem    impulit; illa Noto citius volucrique sagitta    ad terram fugit, et portu se condidit alto.      Tum satus Anchisa, cunctis ex more vocatis,    victorem magna praeconis voce Cloanthum    declarat viridique advelat tempora lauro,    muneraque in naves ternos optare iuvencos,    vinaque et argenti magnum dat ferre talentum.    Ipsis praecipuos ductoribus addit honores:    victori chlamydem auratam, quam plurima circum    purpura maeandro duplici Meliboea cucurrit,    intextusque puer frondosa regius Ida    veloces iaculo cervos cursuque fatigat,    acer, anhelanti similis, quem praepes ab Ida    sublimem pedibus rapuit Iovis armiger uncis;    longaevi palmas nequiquam ad sidera tendunt    custodes, saevitque canum latratus in auras.    At qui deinde locum tenuit virtute secundum,    levibus huic hamis consertam auroque trilicem    loricam, quam Demoleo detraxerat ipse    victor apud rapidum Simoenta sub Ilio alto,    donat habere viro, decus et tutamen in armis.    Vix illam famuli Phegeus Sagarisque ferebant    multiplicem, conixi umeris; indutus at olim    Demoleos cursu palantes Troas agebat.    Tertia dona facit geminos ex aere lebetas,    cymbiaque argento perfecta atque aspera signis.    Iamque adeo donati omnes opibusque superbi    puniceis ibant evincti tempora taenis,    cum saevo e scopulo multa vix arte revolsus,    amissis remis atque ordine debilis uno,    inrisam sine honore ratem Sergestus agebat.    Qualis saepe viae deprensus in aggere serpens,    aerea quem obliquum rota transiit, aut gravis ictu    seminecem liquit saxo lacerumque viator;    nequiquam longos fugiens dat corpore tortus,    parte ferox, ardensque oculis, et sibila colla    arduus attollens, pars volnere clauda retentat    nexantem nodis seque in sua membra plicantem:    tali remigio navis se tarda movebat;    vela facit tamen, et velis subit ostia plenis.    Sergestum Aeneas promisso munere donat,    servatam ob navem laetus sociosque reductos.    Olli serva datur, operum haud ignara Minervae,    Cressa genus, Pholoe, geminique sub ubere nati.      Hoc pius Acneas misso certamine tendit    gramineum in campum, quem collibus undique curvis    cingebant silvae, mediaque in valle theatri    circus erat; quo se multis cum milibus heros    consessu medium tulit exstructoque resedit.    Hic, qui forte velint rapido contendere cursu,    imitat pretiis animos, et praemia ponit.    Undique conveniunt leucri mixtique Sicani,    Nisus et Euryalus primi,    Euryalus forma insignis viridique iuventa,    Nisus amore pio pueri; quos deinde secutus    regius egregia Priami de stirpe Diores;    hunc Salius simul et Patron, quorum alter Acarnan,    alter ab Arcadio Tegeaeae sanguine gentis;    tum duo Trinacrii iuvenes, Helymus Panopesque,    adsueti silvis, comites senioris Acestae;    multi praeterea, quos fama obscura recondit.    Aeneas quibus in mediis sic deinde locutus:    'Accipite haec animis, laetasque advertite mentes:    nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit.    Gnosia bina dabo levato lucida ferro    spicula caelatamque argento ferre bipennem;    omnibus hic erit unus honos.  Tres praemia primi    accipient flavaque caput nectentur oliva.    Primus equum phaleris insignem victor habeto;    alter Amazoniam pharetram plenamque sagittis    Threiciis, lato quam circum amplectitur auro    balteus et tereti subnectit fibula gemma;    tertius Argolica hac galea contentus abito.'      Haec ubi dicta, locum capiunt, signoque repente    corripiunt spatia audito, limenque relinquunt,    effusi nimbo similes, simul ultima signant.    Primus abit longeque ante omnia corpora Nisus    emicat, et ventis et fulminis ocior alis;    proximus huic, longo sed proxumus intervallo,    insequitur Salius; spatio post deinde relicto    tertius Euryalus:    Euryalumque Helymus sequitur; quo deinde sub ipso    ecce volat calcemque terit iam calce Diores,    incumbens umero, spatia et si plura supersint,    transeat elapsus prior, ambiguumque relinquat.

With its coral-red stalks and snowy flowers it has a  very pretty appearance growing, and is the first care of the Breton  farmer--          \"Ah! que la sombre nue aux funestes lueurs,        Planant sur la campagne,      Epargne les bles-noirs, les bles aux blanches fleurs,        Ce pain de la Bretagne.\"\" --STEPHANE HALGAN.      This plant, a native of Asia Minor, was evidently, from its French name,  \"sarrazin,\" introduced into Europe by the Saracens or Moors. We proceeded  by rail to Brest, passing under the foot of the abrupt rock upon which  stand the picturesque ruins of the ancient castle of La Roche Maurice and  the church of La Roche. The rail runs along the banks of the Elorn through  a narrow wooded valley; the windings of the river are very picturesque,  and formerly a steamer ran from Landerneau to Brest, affording the  opportunity of seeing them.    Brest, the first harbour in France, is Breton only in name and locality;  it is built in an amphitheatre on the slopes of two hills divided by the  river Penfeld, which forms the port. On the right is the suburb  Recouvrance, on the left Brest proper. This irregular site often causes  the second floor of the houses in one street to be on a line with the  ground floor of another. Brest is clean and well built, and consists of  three long parallel streets. The principal one, called the Rue de Siam, in  commemoration of the Siamese Ambassadors sent to Louis XIV., who landed  here, runs the whole length of the town, ending at the fine iron bridge  called the Pont Imperiale, the largest swing-bridge ever constructed. You  descend by a flight of steps from the Rue de Siam to the lower streets.  Running along the bay, of considerable extent, and well planted with  trees, is the magnificent promenade called the Cours d'Ajot, from the name  of the officer of the Engineers by whom it was laid out and planted a  century back. Well sheltered by its trees and refreshed by the sea  breezes, it commands a fine view over the new \"port de commerce,\" and the  whole extent of the harbour of Brest, which is capable of containing 500  ships of the line, and is, with the exception of those of Rio Janeiro and  Constantinople, the largest and most beautiful in the world.    Brest harbour has only one entrance, which is to the west, through a  narrow channel called Le Goulet, less than a mile in width, and cut into  two by the Mingant rock. In the year 1796 the 'Republican' was lost here.  Sailing out of the harbour, with a contrary wind and snow, the pilot  thought he had passed the Mingant rock, when the ship struck, and went  down with 800 men on board. Brest Castle in the Middle Ages was a place of  such strength and importance that John IV., who had four times besieged it  fruitlessly, when it was under the English dominion, was wont to say \"Ce  n'est duc de Bretagne, qui n'est pas sire de Brest.\" It had been held by  Sir Robert Knolles against the army of the King of France under Du  Guesclin, who was obliged to raise the siege. The donjon was built by King  Richard II. during the War of Succession. The making Brest an important  naval station was the thought of Richelieu, and the work of Louis XIV.,  who built the arsenal.    Next day we made an excursion to see the church of Notre Dame-du-Folgoet  or the Fool of the Wood, celebrated in legendary lore: the tale is so old  and often told, we have some scruples in repeating it.    Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, there lived in the woods of  Lesneven, a poor idiot boy, called Salaun (Solomon), better known under  the name of the Fool of the Wood (Folgoet). He was miserably clad, had no  bed but the ground; no pillow, but a stone; no roof, but the tree which  gave him shelter. He went every day to Lesneven to seek his daily bread,  but he never begged; he uttered the simple words \"Ave Maria! Solomon could  eat bread,\" and returned with whatever pittance was given him to his tree  near the fountain, into which he dipped his crusts, and plunged even in  the depth of winter, for his bath, always repeating the words, \"Hail,  Maria!\"  One day a party of marauding soldiers accosted him. In answer to  their questions, he replied, \"I am neither for Blois nor Montfort, I am  the servant of the Lady Mary.\" This simple life he led for nearly forty  years, when at last he fell ill and died, repeating his favourite words  \"Ave Maria.\" He was found dead near the fountain, and was buried by his  neighbours. After a time, when the memory of the poor idiot boy had nearly  passed away, there suddenly sprung up from his grave a white lily with the  words \"Ave Maria\" inscribed in letters of gold upon its petals. The news  of the miracle spread throughout all Brittany, Duke John sent  commissioners; the grave was opened, and it was found the lily proceeded  from the mouth of Salaun,--\"ceste royale fleur sortait par sa bouche du  creux de son estomach\"--a testimony of the innocence and piety \"du plus  beau mignon de la reine des Cieux.\" Duke John vowed to erect a church to  our Lady over the fountain of the poor mendicant, whose faith had been  thus recognised;(12) and, faithful to his promise, the first stone was  laid by him in 1366, as a thank-offering for his success the previous year  at the battle of Auray, which had fixed the crown upon his head. His wife,  Joan of Navarre, not only made a pilgrimage to the Folgoet in 1396, but  also contributed to the building of the church. It was completed by John  V., about 1419. The Queen-Duchess Anne of Brittany went there in  pilgrimage after the recovery from illness of Louis XIII. Anne of Austria  founded six masses at the Folgoet, in gratitude for the birth of Louis  XIV., and several popes granted indulgences to those who made pilgrimages  to this shrine. This church is one of the finest in Brittany. Its colour  is sombre; it is the oldest monument in Brittany in which the Kersanton  stone is employed.  This stone is a volcanic rock called hornblende, of  very fine grain, with minute specks of mica. There is a large quarry near  St. Pol de Leon; but it is found principally on the west of the harbour of  Brest, near a village from which it takes its name. Kersanton stone is of  a dark-green colour, approaching to bronze, gives out a metallic sound  when struck, and is easily worked in the quarry, in blocks of from twenty  to forty feet cube, but hardens on exposure to the air. Time has no  destructive effect on it; the most delicate, lightest, and most ornamental  sculptures executed in it remain uninjured, while the hardest granites,  erected at the same time, are friable and decomposed. The Kersanton stone  cuts glass like a diamond.    The architecture of the Folgoet is distinguished for the elegance and  richness of its ornamentation: the softness of the Kersanton stone, when  fresh taken from the quarry fits it specially for the deeply cut,  lace-like works of the artists of the flamboyant school, and the church is  remarkable for the skill with which the productions of the vegetable  kingdom are represented both within and without. It has no transepts, but  to the south is a projection formed by the treasure chamber. The modern  pulpit has a series of medallion bas-reliefs representing the legend of  Solomon.    The jube, or roodloft, is a perfect lacework of stone. Above three arches,  decorated with vine-leaves, is an open-worked gallery of pierced  quatre-foils surpassing in exuberance of ornament any other known.    To the east are five altars, all of Kersanton stone, most delicately  sculptured--the under-cutting of the foliage most wonderful. They are in  the shape of tombs or sarcophagi, the form generally adopted for altars in  the sixteenth century. Round the \"autel des anges,\" richest of them all,  is a row of eighteen niches, filled in with the figures of angels, holding  alternately phylacteries and escutcheons; round the top is a cornice of  thistle-leaves--on the cut stalk of one hangs a dew-drop perfect to nature.    The high altar is decorated with vine-leaves, birds pecking the grapes,  and the ermine, with its motto \"A ma vie,\" introduced. The altar of the  rosary has also a cornice of vine-leaves modelled evidently after the high  altar.    [Illustration: 24. The Fool's Well, Folgoet.]    The fine flamboyant rose window at the east of the church resembles that  of St. Pol de Leon, and below it is the fountain of Salaun. The spring is  concealed under the high altar, and flows into a basin without, preserved  by a kind of Gothic porch sculptured with thistle-leaves and crockets, and  within it, on a bracket, is a delicately chiseled image of the Virgin.  Some children round the fountain offered us pins, the use of which we did  not understand. We afterwards learned that it is the custom in Brittany  for girls to take a pin from their bodice, and throw it into a sacred  well, to ascertain, by its manner of sinking, when they would be married.  If the pin falls head foremost, then there is no present hope of  matrimony, but if the point goes first, it is a sure sign of being married  that year.    On the new year, in some parts of Brittany, pieces of bread-and-butter are  thrown into the fountains, and from the way in which they swim the future  is foretold. If the buttered side turns under, it forebodes death; if two  pieces adhere together, it is a sign of sickness; and if the piece floats,  it is an assurance of long life and happiness.    The veneration for springs and healing wells is of very ancient date, and  was prohibited by early councils of the Church; but the worship of that  element from which suffering humanity seeks for relief in all its ailments  has"]]]
