An attack of typhoid fever reduced him to a state of great  weakness, which was still further increased by erysipelas--a common  complaint in the mountains--in its most virulent form. The latter  disease, settling in the fractured leg, rendered a cure utterly  hopeless. His sufferings have been of the most intense description.  Through all the blossoming spring, and a summer as golden as its own  golden self, of our beautiful California he has languished away  existence in a miserable cabin, his only nurses men, some of them, it  is true, kind and good, others neglectful and careless. A few weeks  since, F. was called in to see him. He decided immediately that nothing  but an amputation would save him. A universal outcry against it was  raised by nearly all the other physicians on the Bar.    They agreed, _en masse_, that he could live but a few weeks unless the  leg--now a mere lump of disease--was taken off. At the same time, they  declared that he would certainly expire under the knife, and that it  was cruel to subject him to any further suffering. You can perhaps  imagine F.'s anxiety. It was a great responsibility for a young  physician to take. Should the patient die during the operation, F.'s  professional reputation would, of course, die with him; but he felt it  his duty to waive all selfish considerations, and give W. that one  chance, feeble as it seemed, for his life. Thank God, the result was  most triumphant. For several days existence hung upon a mere thread. He  was not allowed to speak or move, and was fed from a teaspoon, his only  diet being milk, which we obtained from the Spanish Rancho, sending  twice a week for it. I should have mentioned that F. decidedly refused  to risk an operation in the small and miserable tent in which W. had  languished away nearly half a year, and he was removed to the Empire  the day previous to the amputation. It is almost needless to tell you  that the little fortune, to accumulate which he suffered so much, is  now nearly exhausted. Poor fellow! the philosophy and cheerful  resignation with which he has endured his terrible martyrdom is  beautiful to behold. My heart aches as I look upon his young face and  think of \"his gentle dark-eyed mother weeping lonely at the North\" for  her far-away and suffering son.    As I sat by the bedside of our poor invalid, yielding myself up to a  world of dreamy visionings suggested by the musical sweep of the pine  branch which I waved above his head, and the rosy sunset flushing the  western casement with its soft glory, he suddenly opened his languid  eyes and whispered, \"The Chileno procession is returning. Do you not  hear it?\" I did not tell him--        That the weary sound, and the heavy breath,      And the silent motions of passing death,      And the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank,      Sent through the pores of the coffin-plank,    had already informed me that a far other band than that of the noisy  South Americans was solemnly marching by. It was the funeral train of a  young man who was instantly killed, the evening before, by falling into  one of those deep pits, sunk for mining purposes, which are scattered  over the Bar in almost every direction. I rose quietly and looked from  the window. About a dozen persons were carrying an unpainted coffin,  without pall or bier (the place of the latter being supplied by ropes),  up the steep hill which rises behind the Empire, on the top of which is  situated the burial-ground of Rich Bar. The bearers were all neatly and  cleanly dressed in their miner's costume, which, consisting of a  flannel shirt (almost always of a dark-blue color), pantaloons with the  boots drawn up over them, and a low-crowned broad-brimmed black felt  hat (though the fashion of the latter is not invariable), is not,  simple as it seems, so unpicturesque as you might perhaps imagine. A  strange horror of that lonely mountain graveyard came over me as I  watched the little company wending wearily up to the solitary spot. The  \"sweet habitude of being\"--not that I fear _death_, but that I love  _life_ as, for instance, Charles Lamb loved it--makes me particularly  affect a cheerful burial-place. I know that it is dreadfully  unsentimental, but I should like to make my last home in the heart of a  crowded city, or, better still, in one of those social homes of the  dead, which the Turks, with a philosophy so beautiful and so poetical,  make their most cheerful resort. Singularly enough, Christians seem to  delight in rendering death particularly hideous, and graveyards  decidedly disagreeable. I, on the contrary, would \"plant the latter  with laurels, and sprinkle it with lilies.\" I would wreathe \"sleep's  pale brother\" so thickly with roses that even those rabid moralists who  think that it makes us better to paint him as a dreadful fiend, instead  of a loving friend, could see nothing but their blushing radiance. I  would alter the whole paraphernalia of the coffin, the shroud, and the  bier, particularly the first, which, as Dickens says, \"looks like a  high-shouldered ghost with its hands in its breeches-pockets.\" Why  should we endeavor to make our entrance into a glorious immortality so  unutterably ghastly? Let us glide into the \"fair shadowland\" through a  \"gate of flowers,\" if we may no longer, as in the majestic olden time,  aspire heavenward on the wings of perfumed flame.    How oddly do life and death jostle each other in this strange world of  ours! How nearly allied are smiles and tears! My eyes were yet moist  from the egotistical _pitie de moi-meme_ in which I had been indulging  at the thought of sleeping forever amid these lonely hills, which in a  few years must return to their primeval solitude, perchance never again  to be awakened by the voice of humanity, when the Chileno procession,  every member of it most intensely drunk, really _did_ appear. I never  saw anything more diverting than the whole affair. Of course, _selon  les regles_, I ought to have been shocked and horrified, to have shed  salt tears, and have uttered melancholy jeremiads over their miserable  degradation; but the world is so full of platitudes, my dear, that I  think you will easily forgive me for not boring you with a temperance  lecture, and will good-naturedly let me have my laugh, and not think me  _very_ wicked, after all.    You must know that to-day is the anniversary of the independence of  Chile. The procession got up in honor of it consisted, perhaps, of  twenty men, nearly a third of whom were of that class of Yankees who  are particularly noisy and particularly conspicuous in all celebrations  where it is each man's most onerous duty to get what is technically  called \"tight.\" The man who headed the procession was a complete comic  poem in his own individual self. He was a person of Falstaffian  proportions and coloring, and if a brandy-barrel ever _does_ \"come  alive,\" and, donning a red shirt and buckskin trousers, betake itself  to pedestrianism, it will look more like my hero than anything else  that I can at present think of. With that affectionateness so peculiar  to people when they arrive at the sentimental stage of intoxication,  although it was with the greatest difficulty that he could sustain his  own corporosity, he was tenderly trying to direct the zigzag footsteps  of his companion, a little withered-up, weird-looking Chileno. Alas for  the wickedness of human nature! The latter, whose drunkenness had taken  a Byronic and misanthropical turn, rejected with the basest ingratitude  these delicate attentions. Do not think that my incarnated brandy-cask  was the only one of the party who did unto others as he would they  should do unto him, for the entire band were officiously tendering to  one another the same good-Samaritan-like assistance. I was not  astonished at the Virginia-fence-like style of their marching when I  heard a description of the feast of which they had partaken a few hours  before. A friend of mine, who stepped into the tent where they were  dining, said that the board--really, _board_--was arranged with a  bottle of claret at each plate, and, after the cloth (metaphorically  speaking, I mean, for table-linen is a mere myth in the mines) was  removed, a twenty-gallon keg of brandy was placed in the center, with  quart dippers gracefully encircling it, that each one might help  himself as he pleased. Can you wonder, after that, that every man vied  with his neighbor in illustrating Hogarth's line of beauty? It was  impossible to tell which nation was the more gloriously drunk; but this  I _will_ say, even at the risk of being thought partial to my own  beloved countrymen, That, though the Chilenos reeled with a better  grace, the Americans did it more _naturally_!

Unless I miss my guess, they are a  slick pair.\"    The two strangers had looked to be about forty years of age. Each was  tall and rather stout, with a clean-shaven, florid face and close-cut,  sandy hair. Their eyes had had a shifty snake-like look, and this it  was, as much as anything, which set Andy against them.    The doors to the Martell offices were two in number, one marked  \"Private\" and the other, \"Entrance.\" The boys waited for a few  seconds, and then walked softly over to the latter door. They heard a  murmur of voices, but could not make out what was being said.    \"Perhaps they are in the office marked 'Private,'\" whispered Jack, and  tiptoed his way in that direction, followed by his cousins.    In front of the door to this office they could hear slightly better.  The murmur of voices was at times quite distinct, and they caught the  words: \"Supplies,\" \"Canned goods,\" \"Immediate delivery,\" \"Motor  trucks,\" \"Machinery,\" \"Cash payment,\" \"Night work,\" and a number of  others. Then the murmur of voices grew a little more animated, and  finally they heard Nelson Martell exclaim: \"I think we ought to have a  thousand dollars at least in advance!\"    \"Better make it two thousand,\" came from Slogwell Brown.    There was an exclamation from the strange men, and then the voices  sounded lower so that the Rovers could not hear what was being said.  Suddenly, however, one of the strangers cried out:    \"Oh, I forgot! I have an important engagement in less than half an  hour. I must go at once.\"    \"I guess it's time we got out of here!\" exclaimed Jack, and started to  retreat, as did the others.    The Rover boys had just reached a place in front of the elevators when  the door to one of the back offices opened and much to their surprise  Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown came out. Evidently they had been sent  off by their fathers while their parents had been doing business with  the two strange men.    \"Hello! what are you fellows doing here?\" grumbled Nappy, gazing at  them suspiciously.    \"Did my father come up here?\" questioned Randy, before the others  could speak. \"We want to see him,\" continued the quick-witted Rover.  \"Maybe he's in Mr. Benson's office, fellows,\" he added. \"Come on.\"    There was a Mr. Benson on that floor with an office in the rear.  Without saying another word to Nappy or Slugger, the Rover boys  marched to the door of the Benson place, knocked, and went in.    \"Say, that was a neat trick, all right enough,\" whispered Jack to  Randy. \"But now you've got us into it, you'll have to get us out.\"    \"Humph! that's easy enough,\" was the ready reply. \"Just leave it to  me.\"    A clerk came up, looking inquiringly at the boys.    \"Excuse me, but did my father come up here?\" questioned Randy  innocently. And then, as the clerk looked puzzled, he added: \"I am  Randy Rover. My father is Thomas Rover of The Rover Company.\"    \"Oh, I see!\" and the clerk smiled. \"No, I don't think your father came  up here, but I'll ask Mr. Benson.\" The clerk disappeared into an inner  office, to reappear a moment later. \"Sorry, but your father hasn't  been up here to-day.\"    \"Thank you,\" returned Randy; and then he and the others backed  themselves out.    The stairway was close at hand, and a few seconds later the four Rover  boys were on the fourth floor. Here they waited for the elevator, and  soon found themselves on the ground floor, and from that walked to the  street.    \"Let's hang around and see if that fellow really goes away,\" advised  Fred.    This they did, and in a few minutes saw the two German-looking men  come from the building. They seemed to be in a great hurry, and lost  no time in disappearing up Wall Street in the direction of Broadway.    \"I wonder if we hadn't better follow them?\" said Fred.    \"It might be rather a long-winded job, and we haven't time,\" answered  Jack.    \"Let us stay around until my father is at leisure,\" said Randy. \"Then  we can tell him what we have heard and see what he thinks of it.\" And  so it was decided.          CHAPTER XIII    FUN AT THE RAILROAD STATION      \"There may be a good deal in this, and there may be nothing at all,\"  were Tom Rover's words, after he had listened to the story the boys  had to tell. \"This may be a perfectly legitimate business transaction,  although, as I have said before, Nelson Martell has been known to go  into more than one shady transaction here in Wall Street. Generally,  however, he just manages to escape falling into the clutches of the  law.\"    \"Yes, but Dad! you must remember how Mr. Brown tried to treat old  Barney Stevenson,\" broke in Randy.    \"Yes, I remember that,\" answered his father. \"And I have heard that  Brown is no more reliable than is Martell. But to know a fact is one  thing, to prove it in a court of law is another.\"    \"And those two strangers were certainly Germans,\" said Andy.    \"I'll look into this a little further as soon as I get time,\" said Tom  Rover, after a moment of thought. \"And perhaps I'll speak to one of  the Secret Service men about it. It certainly will do no harm to have  these men watched for a few days.\"    A little later Tom Rover was through with his labors at his office,  and then he and the boys returned to the homes on Riverside Drive. The  father of the twins had to go out in the evening, and the boys spent  the time at home with their mothers and the girls.    \"We can't go straight through to Haven Point this morning,\" announced  Jack, on the following day, when they had arrived at the railroad  terminal. \"They are shipping some soldiers and some naval supplies,  and the road is somewhat balled up. The gateman told me we should have  to make two changes.\"    All of the mothers had come down to see the young folks off. Jack and  Fred, as well as their sisters, felt particularly sorry for their  parents, now left entirely alone so far as their own families were  concerned.    \"But never mind, Ma,\" said Martha. \"The term at Clearwater Hall will  soon be at an end, and then we'll be home again.\"    \"And don't forget that we are to pay a visit to Camp Huxwell if the  authorities will permit it and dad is still there,\" added Mary to her  parent.    \"Sure! we'll all go,\" cried Fred.    Owing to war conditions, there was no parlor car on the train, but the  boys and girls managed to get seats together, for which they were  thankful. They made themselves as comfortable as possible, and then  settled down to read their newspapers and magazines, or gaze out of  the window at the scenes which were flashing by.    There was no dining car on this train, but from the conductor the  young folks learned that they would have to change at a place called  Raymonton, and they would there have half an hour in which to get  lunch.    \"I can get all I want in less time than that, provided it's to be  had,\" said Fred. \"We can go to the lunch room just as soon as the  train gets in.\"    Raymonton was nothing but an overgrown village containing but a  handful of stores, a church, a garage, and a canning factory, with the  houses occupying half a dozen straggly-looking streets. There was only  a small and not an altogether inviting-looking lunch room, and here  the bill-of-fare was decidedly meagre.    A tall, angular Irish girl waited on them. She was pleasant enough,  and smiled broadly at the twins' jokes. She served them with  sandwiches, cake, pie, and hot chocolate, and they also purchased from  her a bag of grapes and pears.    \"I told you we'd have plenty of time,\" remarked Fred, looking at a  clock on the wall. \"We have still ten minutes to spare.\"    \"I think I'll get a shoe-shine,\" said Jack. \"I saw a bootblack outside  roaming around doing nothing. If I give him work it may keep him out  of mischief.\"    At the end of the railroad platform was a stand devoted to the sale of  newspapers and periodicals, chewing gum and candy. There was also a  rack with postcards, and the girls busied themselves at this, picking  out such cards as they desired. Not far from where the stand was  located stood a long auto-stage, marked \"_Raymonton to Clappville.  Fare 10 Cents._\" On the seat of the stage sat an elderly driver,  smoking, and the bus contained one or two men and several women and  children, evidently waiting for the stage to start on its journey.    Jack had just finished having his shoes polished when he and the other  boys noticed a man at the newsstand talking to the proprietor. Both  men appeared to be out of sorts.    \"Sorry, Sir, but you can't have that magazine!\" they heard the stand  keeper exclaim.    \"I'd like to know why not!\" demanded the would-be customer. \"I am  ready to pay for it.\"    \"That's all right--but you can't have it! I get only two copies of  that magazine, and one is for the hotel and the other for Doctor  Johnson's daughter. They both take it regular.\"    \"Humph! I guess you don't want any customers,\" growled the other man  savagely. \"Well, if you don't want to sell me any of your old  magazines you can keep them! I guess I can get all the magazines I  want elsewhere.\" And the man stalked off in haughty anger.    The boys had watched this scene and listened to the talk with much  interest. They had recognized in the would-be customer Asa Lemm, the  professor who previous to his discharge from that institution had made  life so miserable for them at Colby Hall.    \"I'm glad the fellow didn't let him have the magazine,\" said Fred.    \"Gee, I wish we could put one over on old Lemm!\" whispered Andy.    \"I wonder what he is doing in this town?\" queried Randy.    \"I think I can answer that,\" replied Jack. \"I once heard that he had  some relative--a brother I think--living at Clappville. Maybe he came  from there, or is going over to that town in the stage.\"    Without allowing themselves to be noticed, Andy and Randy kept their  eyes on Asa Lemm and saw him hurry over to one of"]]]
