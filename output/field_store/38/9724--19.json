They were at one time quite numerous in Wisconsin and  Minnesota, as well as others of the Northern and Central States, but  today are found but rarely in those sections. Wisconsin is sometimes  called the \"Badger State\" because of the numbers of these animals  found there by the early settlers.    The badger is an animal of peculiar build, having a heavy, broad  body, at times appearing almost flat, as when it crouches close to  the ground, and the legs are short and stout. The feet are furnished  with long, strong claws, adapted for digging. The tail is short, the  ears short and round, the eyes small and black. A full grown specimen  will measure about two feet or more from the end of the nose to the  base of the tail.    The color is a grizzly, yellowish grey, being darker on the back. A  white line traverses the face, head and neck, bordered with black,  which latter marking extends around the eyes. The sides of the face  and the throat are white, and there is a black patch in front of each  ear. The legs and feet are black. The back and sides of the body are  mottled somewhat by narrow streaks of darker fur.    The fur, or more properly speaking, the hair, is long and appears to  be parted on the back as it hangs off to either side from a line down  the center of the back. Each separate hair shows a number of colors  and it is this which gives the animal the peculiar grizzled  appearance. Although the animal is, as before stated, of a heavy  build, the casual observer would scarcely credit the animal with the  great strength which it really possesses, because of the apparently  soft and flabby body, however, the strength of the animal is  surprising. They are slow moving creatures and were it not for their  strength and powers of digging, they would have difficulty in  procuring a sufficient amount of food.    They feed on the small burrowing animals mainly, such as the prairie  dog, the gopher and the pouched rat, and they are enabled to capture  many of these animals by digging them out of the dens. They also eat  mice and reptiles and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds.    Being such an expert digger, the badger makes a deep den. The  entrance to the den is wide and surrounded by a mound of earth. In  addition to the main den the animal has a number of others nearby, so  that one would scarcely know which of them is the main burrow. They  are hibernating animals and remain in the dens during the cold  portion of the winter.    The animal is of a rather timid nature, and when alarmed seeks safety  in the den if possible, but when surprised far from the den, will  hide wherever possible and failing to find cover will flatten down  close to the ground and by remaining very quiet, will try to escape  notice. However when pursued, and finding escape impossible, they  will fight desperately.    The young are born in early spring, there being as a rule three or  four in a litter.    The fur of the badger is used for making brushes of various kinds,  its peculiar texture making it especially desirable for this purpose.  It is not used for wearing apparel.    The No. 3 trap is the proper size to use for this animal, and only  the stronger ones should be used. They are caught and held  occasionally in smaller and weaker traps, yet such cases are  exceptional.    As the animal is not a valuable one and is not found in large numbers  in any one locality, they are not much sought by the trappers and the  most of the Skins which reach the market are from the animals caught  in traps set for other game. The wolf and coyote trappers catch them  occasionally, as they may be captured by any of the methods used for  those animals.    Perhaps the best way in which to capture the badger is to set the  trap at the entrance to the main burrow, that is, the one showing the  most use. The trap should be set just outside of the entrance and  should be securely staked, using a long stake driven out of sight in  the ground. The jaws of the trap should be parallel with the passage,  so that the badger will step between the jaws, and not over them. It  should be bedded down so that the covering will be flush with the  surroundings.    Traps may also be set with bait. On the plains, material for  enclosures can not be found but the traps may be set between clumps  of sage brush or cactus, placing the bait behind the trap, the  setting being so arranged that the badger will be obliged to walk  over the trap in order to reach the bait. The trap should be securely  staked in all cases. For bait, rabbit, sage hen, prairie dog or  almost any kind of fresh meat may be used.      [Illustration: The Opossum.]        CHAPTER XV.    THE OPOSSUM.    The opossum is the only American member of the family of pouched  animals. Only one species is found in this country although others  are found in other parts of the world. Of the American species,  naturalists have discovered three varieties, namely the Virginia  opossum, the Florida opossum and the Texas opossum, all very similar.    The Virginia opossum is the most common and the most widely  distributed, being found as far north as Pennsylvania and Ohio and  from there westward to Nebraska and southward. In the southwest the  Texas opossum is found.    In general form the opossum resembles the house rat but is much  larger. The tail is almost bare and is prehensile, that is, it is  capable of holding on to anything which it encircles. The muzzle is  long and pointed, the ears bare.    In color this animal is generally a grizzly gray but some specimens  are much darker than others. The fur is long, soft and fluffy.    The opossum dens in the ground and the abode is usually located under  a stump or rock. The burrows are shallow and terminate in a larger  cavity lined with dry leaves. They also sometimes locate in hollow  logs. They are found only in timbered districts and are active  climbers. Their food consists mainly of mice, eggs and young birds  and insects, but they are also fond of poultry and almost any kind of  flesh, fresh or tainted. They are not strictly carnivorous as they  feed on persimmons, paw-paws, polk berries and other wild fruits.    They are slow moving and stupid creatures and have no means of  defending themselves against their enemies. It is true that they do  have a habit of feigning death when frightened but this trick is of  no value in case of an attack from other animals, for no wild animal  would be deceived, and even if it were, there would be no hope for  the opossum for it would only be a case of a meal already prepared  for the attacking animal. On other occasions instead of feigning  death the animal will open its mouth and present a rather fierce  appearance, but there is little danger of them biting.    While the opossum is not a hibernating animal it remains in its den  during cold weather. It is a southern animal and the severe winters  in the northern parts of its range are not to the animal's liking,  They are most active on warm, damp nights for they do not like to  move about when the weather is dry and the leaves are rustly.    They are very prolific, bringing forth from six to twelve young at a  litter and in some cases even more. When newly born they are very  small and imperfectly formed and are carried by the mother in the  pouch on the under side of the body until large enough to travel.    They become prime about the second week of November in the North and  remain in good condition until March. In the South they do not become  prime until about December 1st and commence to shed much earlier than  in the North. The fur is not a very valuable one but there is a  growing demand for the flesh which is used as food and in many places  will meet with ready sale.    I recommend the No. 1 trap for this animal and those of medium  strength of spring only, as the opossum's foot and leg is tender, and  if the bones are broken the animal is likely to escape. They do not  struggle much, however, and comparatively few escape from the traps.    I set my traps in the thick woods, usually in the gullies also along  the edges of the woods, along fences, etc. The opossum is possessed  of no cunning whatever, and no special care is needed in setting the  traps if this animal alone is expected, however, it is always best to  use care in setting for the most stupid animals, as one never knows  what animal may pass that way. Whenever possible I place the trap in  a natural enclosure, such as a hollow in the side of a stump or tree,  a hollow between two spreading roots, an opening among rocks or in a  hollow log. Failing to find any such place I construct a small  enclosure of stakes, bark, stones or pieces of rotten wood, whichever  is most convenient, and set the trap in the entrance nesting it down  and covering with whatever is found nearby.    The trap may be staked, stapled or fastened to a clog. For bait I use  rabbit, fowl, muskrat or small birds of any kind. Bait may be fresh  or tainted as the opossum is not particular. I have heard of many  fancy sets and baits and have given some of them a trial, but find  the method given above to be the most satisfactory.    Opossums will sometimes be caught in traps set for skunks, foxes and  other animals and there are probably more of them caught in such sets  than in any other. They may also be caught in wooden traps.    I have caught these animals in traps set on logs spanning the  streams, also at the entrance of the dens, but if I were setting  many traps for opossums I would use the above method mostly. The  opossum makes a wandering, aimless sort of trail, quite broad for  an animal of its size and the toes are turned outward in walking.  The footprints of the average opossum will measure about one and  one-fourth inch in diameter--that is, the front foot--the print of  the hind foot being from one-fourth to one-half inch larger.

THE "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#16)"],[1,"center of the village) to determine upon their next raid,  and plan for a horse stealing trip, Mr. Crow was always nearby to hear  all their plans discussed. He would then fly away to his master (the  Chief) and tell him all that he had learned.    The Chief would then send a band of his warriors to lie in ambush for  the raiding party, and, as the enemy would not suspect anything they  would go blindly into the pitfall of death thus set for them. Thus the  crow was the scout of this chief, whose reputation as a Wakan (Holy man)  soon reached all of the different tribes. The Chief's warriors would  intercept, ambush and annihilate every war party headed for his camp.    So, finally learning that they could not make war on this chief's people  unbeknown to them, they gave up making war on this particular band. When  meat was running low in the camp this chief would send the crow out to  look for buffalo. When he discovered a herd he would return and report  to his master; then the chief would order out the hunters and they  would return laden with meat. Thus the crow kept the camp all the time  informed of everything that would be of benefit to them.    One day the crow disappeared, over which there was great grief among the  tribe. A week had passed away, when Mr. Crow reappeared. There was  great rejoicing upon his return, but the crow was downcast and would not  speak, but sat with a drooping head perched at the top of the chief's  tepee, and refused all food that was offered to him.    In vain did the chief try to get the crow to tell him the cause of his  silence and seeming grief. The crow would not speak until the chief  said: \"Well, I will take a few of my warriors and go out and try to  ascertain what has happened to cause you to act as you do.\"    Upon hearing this, the crow said: \"Don't go. I dreaded to tell you what  I know to be a fact, as I have heard it from some great medicine men.  I was traveling over the mountains west of here, when I spied three old  men sitting at the top of the highest peak. I very cautiously dropped  down behind a rock and listened to their talk. I heard your name  mentioned by one of them, then your brother's name was mentioned. Then  the third, who was the oldest, said: 'in three days from today the  lightning will kill those two brothers whom all the nations fear.'\"    Upon hearing what the crow stated the tribe became grief stricken. On  the morning of the third day the chief ordered a nice tepee placed upon  the highest point, far enough away from the village, so that the peals  of thunder would not alarm the babies of the camp.    A great feast was given, and after the feasting was over there came in  six young maidens leading the war horses of the two brothers. The horses  were painted and decorated as if for a charge on the enemy. One maiden  walked ahead of the chief's horse bearing in her hands the bow and  arrows of the great warrior. Next came two maidens, one on either side  of the prancing war steed, each holding a rein. Behind the chief's horse  came the fourth maiden. Like the first, she bore in her hands the bow  and arrows of the chief's brother. Then the fifth and sixth maidens  each holding a rein, walked on either side of the prancing horse of  the chief's brother. They advanced and circled the large gathering and  finally stopped directly in front of the two brothers, who immediately  arose and taking their bows and arrows vaulted lightly upon their war  steeds, and singing their death song, galloped off amid a great cry of  grief from the people who loved them most dearly.    Heading straight for the tepee that had been placed upon the highest  point, adjacent to the village, they soon arrived at their destination  and, dismounting from their horses, turned, waved their hands to their  band, and disappeared within the tepee. Scarcely had they entered the  lodge when the rumblings of distant thunder could be heard. Nearer, and  nearer, came the sound, until at last the storm overspread the locality  in all its fury. Flash upon flash of lightning burst forth from the  heavens. Deafening peals of thunder followed each flash. Finally, one  flash brighter than any of the others, one peal more deafening than  those preceding it, and the storm had passed.    Sadly the warriors gathered together, mounted their horses and slowly  rode to the tepee on the high point. Arriving there they looked inside  the lodge and saw the two brothers lying cold and still in death, each  holding the lariat of his favorite war horse. The horses also lay dead  side by side in front of the tent. (From this came the custom of killing  the favorite horse of a dead warrior at the burial of the owner).    As the Indians sadly left the hill to return home, they heard a noise at  the top of the tepee, and looking up they saw the crow sitting on one  of the splintered tepee poles. He was crying most pitifully, and as they  rode off he flew up high in the air and his pitiful \"caw\" became fainter  and fainter till at last they heard it no more. And from that day, the  story goes, no crow ever goes near the village of that band of Indians.              THE \"WASNA\" (PEMMICAN) MAN AND THE UNKTOMI (SPIDER)    Once upon a time there appeared from out of a large belt of timber a  man attired in the fat of the buffalo. On his head he wore the honeycomb  part of the stomach. To this was attached small pieces of fat. The fat  which covered the stomach he wore as a cloak. The large intestines he  wore as leggings, and the kidney fat as his moccasins.    As he appeared he had the misfortune to meet \"Unktomi\" (spider) with  his hundreds of starving children. Upon seeing the fat, Unktomi and his  large family at once attacked the man, who, in order to save his life,  started to run away, but so closely did Unktomi and his family pursue  him that in order to make better time and also get a little better  start, he threw off his head covering, which the Unktomi family hastily  devoured, and were again closing in upon him. He then threw off his  cloak and they devoured that, and were close upon him again, when he  threw off his leggings. These were hastily eaten up, and, as they drew  near to a lake, the man threw off the kidney fat, and, running to  the edge of the lake, dived down into the water and kept beneath the  surface, swimming to the opposite shore. After the Unktomi family had  eaten the kidney fat they came to the water's edge, and the grease was  floating on the surface of the water which they lapped up, until there  was not a grease spot left floating on the surface.    The small morsels had only sharpened their appetites, and as they saw  the man sitting on the opposite shore, Unktomi and his family proceeded  around the lake and came upon two men sitting on the shore. Unktomi saw  that the other man was \"Wakapapi\" (pounded beef). The family surrounded  the two and Unktomi ordered them to fight. Fearing Unktomi and his  large family, they at once commenced to fight and Pounded Meat was soon  killed. The hungry family at once fell to eating him. So busy were they  that none noticed the fat man sneak off and disappear.    When they had finished the pounded beef man they looked around to fall  upon the fat man, but nowhere could he be seen. Unktomi said, \"I will  track him and when I find him, I will return for you, so stay here and  await my return.\"    He followed the fat man's tracks until farther east on the shore of the  lake he found the fat man in the act of skinning a deer, which he had  killed. (He had held on to his bow and arrows when he jumped into the  lake). \"My,\" said Unktomi, \"this will make a fine meal for my hungry  children. I will go after them, so hurry and cut the meat up into small  pieces so they each can have a piece.\"    \"All right, go ahead and get your family,\" said Fat Man. During  Unktomi's absence, the fat man hurriedly cut the meat up into small  pieces and carried them up into a tree that stood near to the shore.  When he had carried it all up he threw sand and dirt upon the blood, and  so left no trace of the deer.    On the arrival of Unktomi and his family, no signs of the fat man or  the deer could be found. They wandered about the spot looking for tracks  which might lead them to where the fat man had cached the meat, as  Unktomi said he could not have carried it very far. Now the fat man was  up in the tree and sat watching them. The reflection of the tree was in  the water, and some of the children going close to the shore, discovered  it as they looked at the reflection. The fat man cut a piece of meat and  extending it towards them, drew back his hand and put the meat into his  mouth.    \"Come quick, father, here he is eating the meat,\" said the children.  Unktomi came and seeing the reflection, thought the fat man was down in  the lake. \"Wait, I will bring him up for you.\" So saying, he dived down,  but soon arose without anything. Again and again he tried, but could not  reach the bottom. He told the children to gather rock for him. These  he tied around his neck and body, and dived down for the last time. The  last the children saw of their father was the bubbles which arose to the  surface of the lake. The rocks being too heavy for him, held him fast  to the bottom, and some hungry fish soon made a feast out of the body of  poor \"Unktomi.\"              THE RESUSCITATION OF THE ONLY DAUGHTER    There once lived an old couple who had an only daughter. She was a  beautiful girl, and was very much courted by the young men of the  tribe, but she said that she preferred single life, and to all their  heart-touching tales of deep affection for her she always had one  answer. That was \"No.\"    One day this maiden fell ill and day after day grew worse. All the best  medicine men were called in, but their medicines were of no avail, and  in two weeks from the day that she was taken ill she lay a corpse. Of  course there was great mourning in the"]]]
