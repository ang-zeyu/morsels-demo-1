My boy! my boy!\" And the  struggling little wild thing in her arms grew quiet, his animal anger  died away, his raucous hissing gave place to a short panting, and that  to a low sobbing that ended in a flood of tears and a passionate \"Mamma,  mamma, mamma!\" as the veil of a different life was rolled away, and he  clung to his mother's bosom.    [Illustration]    But even as she cooed to him, and stroked his brow and won him back  again, there was a strange sound, a snarling hiss at the open door. All  turned to see a great Badger standing there with its front feet on the  threshold. Father and cousin exclaimed, \"Look at that Badger!\" and  reached for the ready gun, but the boy screamed again. He wriggled from  his mother's arms and rushing to the door, cried, \"My Badgie! my  Badgie!\" He flung his arms about the savage thing's neck, and it  answered with a low purring sound as it licked its lost companion's  face. The men were for killing the Badger, but it was the mother's  keener insight that saved it, as one might save a noble dog that had  rescued a child from the water.    It was some days before the child would let the father come near. \"I  hate that man; he passed me every day and would not look at me,\" was the  only explanation. Doubtless the first part was true, for the Badger den  was but two miles from the house and the father rode past many times in  his radiating search, but the tow-topped head had escaped his eye.    It was long and only by slow degrees that the mother got the story that  is written here, and parts of it were far from clear. It might all have  been dismissed as a dream or a delirium but for the fact that the boy  had been absent two weeks; he was well and strong now, excepting that  his lips were blackened and cracked with the muddy water, the Badger had  followed him home, and was now his constant friend.    [Illustration]    It was strange to see how the child oscillated between the two lives,  sometimes talking to his people exactly as he used to talk, and  sometimes running on all fours, growling, hissing, and tussling with the  Badger. Many a game of \"King of the Castle\" they had together on the low  pile of sand left after the digging of a new well. Each would climb to  the top and defy the other to pull him down, till a hold was secured and  they rolled together to the level, clutching and tugging, Harry  giggling, the Badger uttering a peculiar high-pitched sound that might  have been called snarling had it not been an expression of good nature.  Surely it was a Badger laugh. There was little that Harry could ask  without receiving, in those days, but his mother was shocked when he  persisted that the Badger must sleep in his bed; yet she so arranged it.  The mother would go in the late hours and look on them with a little  pang of jealousy as she saw her baby curled up, sleeping soundly with  that strange beast.    It was Harry's turn to feed his friend now, and side by side they sat to  eat. The Badger had become an established member of the family. But  after a month had gone by an incident took place that I would gladly  leave untold.      THE HUMAN BRUTE    Grogan, the unpleasant neighbour, who had first frightened Harry into  the den, came riding up to the Service homestead. Harry was in the house  for the moment. The Badger was on the sand pile. Instantly on catching  sight of it, Grogan unslung his gun and exclaimed, \"A Badger!\" To him a  Badger was merely something to be killed. \"Bang!\" and the kindly animal  rolled over, stung and bleeding, but recovered and dragged herself  toward the house. \"Bang!\" and the murderer fired again, just as the  inmates rushed to the door--too late. Harry ran toward the Badger  shouting, \"Badgie! my Badgie!\" He flung his baby arms around the  bleeding neck. It fawned on him feebly, purring a low, hissing purr,  then mixing the purrs with moans, grew silent, and slowly sank down, and  died in his arms. \"My Badgie! my Badgie!\" the boy wailed, and all the  ferocity of his animal nature was directed against Grogan.    \"You better get out of this before I kill you!\" thundered the father,  and the hulking halfbreed sullenly mounted his horse and rode away.    A great part of his life had been cut away and it seemed as though a  deathblow had been dealt the boy. The shock was more than he could  stand. He moaned and wept all day, he screamed himself into  convulsions, he was worn out at sundown and slept little that night.  Next morning he was in a raging fever and ever he called for \"My  Badgie!\" He seemed at death's door the next day, but a week later he  began to mend and in three weeks was strong as ever and childishly gay,  with occasional spells of sad remembering that gradually ceased.    He grew up to early manhood in a land of hunters, but he took no  pleasure in the killing that was such sport to his neighbour's sons, and  to his dying day he could not look on the skin of a Badger without  feelings of love, tenderness, and regret.    This is the story of the Badger as it was told me, and those who wish to  inquire further can do so at Winnipeg, if they seek out Archbishop  Matheson, Dr. R. M. Simpson, or Mrs. George A. Frazer of Kildonan. These  witnesses may differ as to the details, but all have assured me that in  its main outlines this tale is true, and I gladly tell it, for I want  you to realize the kindly disposition that is in that sturdy, harmless,  noble wild animal that sits on the low prairie mounds, for then I know  that you will join with me in loving him, and in seeking to save his  race from extermination.                 *       *       *       *       *    VIII    The Squirrel and His Jerky-tail Brothers           *       *       *       *       *          VIII    The Squirrel and His Jerky-tail Brothers      You remember that Hiawatha christened the Squirrel  \"Adjidaumo\"--\"Tail-in-air\" and this Tail-in-air was chattering overhead  as I sat, some twenty-five years ago, on the shore of the Lake of the  Woods with an Ojibwa Indian, checking up the animals' names in the  native tongue. Of course the Red-squirrel was early in our notice.    \"Ad-je-_daw_-mo\" I called it, but the Indian corrected me;  \"Ah-chit-aw-_mo_\" he made it; and when I translated it \"Tail-in-air\" he  said gravely, \"No, it means head downward.\" Then noting my surprise, he  added, with characteristic courtesy, \"Yes, yes, you are right; if his  head is down, his tail must be up.\" Thoreau talks of the Red-squirrel  flicking his tail like a whip-lash, and the word \"Squirrel,\" from the  Latin \"_Sciurus_\" and Greek \"_Skia-oura_\" means \"shady tail.\" Thus all  of its names seem to note the wonderful banner that serves the animal  in turn as sun-shade, signal-flag, coverlet, and parachute.      THE CHEEKY PINE SQUIRREL    [Illustration]    A wonderfully extensive kingdom has fallen to Adjidaumo of the shady  tail; all of Canada and most of the Rockies are his. He is at home  wherever there are pine forests and a cool climate; and he covers so  many ranges of diverse conditions that, responding to the new  environments in lesser matters of makeup, we have a score of different  Squirrel races from this parent stock. In size, in tail, in kind or  depth of coat they differ to the expert eye, but so far as I can see  they are exactly alike in all their ways, their calls and their  dispositions.    The Pine Squirrel is the form found in the Rockies about the Yellowstone  Park. It is a little darker in colour than the Red-squirrel of the East,  but I find no other difference. It has the same aggressive, scolding  propensities, the same love of the pinyons and their product, the same  friends and the same foes, with one possible partial exception in the  list of habits, and that is in its method of storing up mushrooms.    [Illustration]    The pinyons, or nuts of the pinyon pine, are perhaps the most delicious  nuts in all the lap of bountiful dame Nature, from fir belt in the  north to equatorial heat and on to far Fuego. All wild creatures revel  in the pinyons. To the Squirrels they are more than the staff of life;  they are meat and potatoes, bread and honey, pork and beans, bread and  cake, sugar and chocolate, the sum of comfort, and the promise of  continuing joy. But the pinyon does not bear every year; there are off  years, as with other trees, and the Squirrels might be in a bad way if  they had no other supply of food to lay up for the winter.    [Illustration: XXV. Red-squirrel storing mushrooms for winter use  _Sketched from life in the Selkirk Mountains, by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: XXVI. Chink stalking the Picket-pin  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    A season I spent in the Southern Rockies was an off year for pinyons,  and when September came I was shown what the Squirrels do in such an  emergency. All through autumn the slopes of the hills were dotted with  the umbrellas of countless toadstools or mushrooms, representing many  fat and wholesome species. It is well known that while a few of them are  poisonous, a great many are good food. Scientists can find out which is  which only by slow experiment. \"Eat them; if you live they are good, if  you die they are poisonous\" has been suggested as a certain method. The  Squirrels must have worked this out long ago, for they surely know the  good ones; and all through late summer they are at work gathering them  for winter use in place of the pine-nuts.    [Illustration]    Now if the provident Squirrel stored these up as he does the pinyons, in  holes or underground, they would surely go to mush in a short time and  be lost. He makes no such mistake. He stores them in the forked branches  of trees, where they dry out and remain good until needed; and wisely  puts them high enough up to be out of reach of the Deer and low enough  to avoid being dislodged by the wind.

Judaism has preserved the Jews! Judaism, that is, the Law with its  development and ramifications of a great religious thought, was the  sustaining power of the Jewish people under its burden of misery,  suffering, torture, and oppression, enabling it to survive its  tormentors. The Jews were the nation of hope. Like hope this people is  eternal. The storms of fanaticism and race hatred may rage and roar, the  race cannot be destroyed. Precisely in the days of its abject  degradation, when its suffering was dire, how marvellous the conduct of  this people! The conquered were greater than their conquerors. From  their spiritual height they looked down compassionately on their  victorious but ignorant adversaries, who, feeling the condescension of  the victims, drove their irons deeper. The little nation grew only the  stronger, and its religion, the flower of hope and trust, developed the  more sturdily for its icy covering. Jews were mowed down by fire and  sword, but Judaism continued to live. From the ashes of every pyre  sprang the Jewish Law in unfading youth--that indestructible,  ineradicable mentality and hope, which opponents are wont to call  unconquerable Jewish defiance.    The men of this great little race were preserved by the Law, the spirit,  and the influences and effects of this same Law transformed weak women  into God-inspired martyrs, dowered the daughters of Israel with courage  to sacrifice life for the glory of the God-idea confessed by their  ancestors during thousands of years. Purity of morals, confiding  domesticity, were the safeguards against storm and stress. The outside  world presented a hostile front to the Jew of the middle ages. Every  step beyond Ghetto precincts was beset with peril. So his home became  his world, his sanctuary, in whose intimate seclusion the blossom of  pure family love unfolded. While spiritual darkness brooded over the  nations, the great Messianic God-idea took refuge from the icy chill of  the middle ages in his humble rooms, where it was cherished against the  coming of a glorious future.    \"Every Jew has the making of a Messiah in him,\" says a clever modern  author,[25] \"and every Jewess of a _mater dolorosa_,\" of which the first  part is only an epigram, the second, a truth, an historic fact.  Mediaeval Judaism knew many \"sorrowful mothers,\" whose heroism passes  our latter-day conception. Greece and Rome tell tales upon tales of  womanly bravery under suffering and pain--Jewish history buries in  silence the names of its thousands of woman and maiden martyrs, joyously  giving up life in the vindication of their faith. Perhaps, had one woman  been too weak to resist, too cowardly to court and embrace death, her  name might have been preserved. Such, too, fail to appear in the Jewish  annals, which contain but few women's names of any kind. Inspired  devotion of strength and life to Judaism was as natural with a Jewess as  quiet, unostentatious activity in her home. No need, therefore, to make  mention of act or name.    Jewish woman, then, has neither found, nor sought, and does not need, a  Frauenlob, historian or poet, to proclaim her praise in the gates, to  touch the strings of his lyre in her honor. Her life, in its simplicity  and gentleness, its patience and exalted devotion, is itself a Song of  Songs, more beautiful than poet ever composed, a hymn more joyous than  any ever sung, on the prophetess's sublime and touching text, _Em  beyisrael_, \"a mother in Israel.\"    As Miriam and Deborah are representative of womanhood during Israel's  national life, so later times, the Talmudic periods, produced women with  great and admirable qualities. Prominent among them was Beruriah, the  gentle wife of Rabbi Meir, the Beruriah whose heart is laid bare in the  following touching story from the Talmud:[26]    One Sabbath her husband had been in the academy all day teaching the  crowds that eagerly flocked to his lectures. During his absence from  home, his two sons, distinguished for beauty and learning, died suddenly  of a malignant disease. Beruriah bore the dear bodies into her sleeping  chamber, and spread a white cloth over them. When the rabbi returned in  the evening, and asked for his boys that, according to wont, he might  bless them, his wife said, \"They have gone to the house of God.\"    She brought the wine-cup, and he recited the concluding prayer of the  Sabbath, drinking from the cup, and, in obedience to a hallowed custom,  passing it to his wife. Again he asked, \"Why are my sons not here to  drink from the blessed cup?\" \"They cannot be far off,\" answered the  patient sufferer, and suspecting naught, Rabbi Meir was happy and  cheerful. When he had finished his meal, Beruriah said: \"Rabbi, allow me  to ask you a question.\" With his permission, she continued: \"Some time  ago a treasure was entrusted to me, and now the owner demands it. Shall  I give it up?\" \"Surely, my wife should not find it necessary to ask this  question,\" said the rabbi. \"Can you hesitate about returning property to  its rightful owner?\" \"True,\" she replied, \"but I thought best not to  return it until I had advised you thereof.\" And she led him into the  chamber to the bed, and withdrew the cloth from the bodies. \"O, my sons,  my sons,\" lamented the father with a loud voice, \"light of my eyes, lamp  of my soul. I was your father, but you taught me the Law.\" Her eyes  suffused with tears, Beruriah seized her grief-stricken husband's hand,  and spoke: \"Rabbi, did you not teach me to return without reluctance  that which has been entrusted to our safekeeping? See, 'the Lord gave,  and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'\"  \"'Blessed be the name of the Lord,'\" repeated the rabbi, accepting her  consolation, \"and blessed, too, be His name for your sake; for, it is  written: 'Who can find a virtuous woman? for far above pearls is her  value.... She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is  upon her tongue.'\"    Surrounded by the halo of motherhood, richly dowered with intellectual  gifts, distinguished for learning, gentleness, and refinement, Beruriah  is a truly poetic figure. Incensed at the evil-doing of the unrighteous,  her husband prayed for their destruction. \"How can you ask that, Rabbi?\"  Beruriah interrupted him; \"do not the Scriptures say: 'May _sins_ cease  from off the earth, and the wicked will be no more'? When _sin_ ceases,  there will be no more _sinners_. Pray rather, my rabbi, that they  repent, and amend their ways.\"[27]    That a woman could attain to Beruriah's mental poise, and make her voice  heard and heeded in the councils of the teachers of the Law, and that  the rabbis considered her sayings and doings worthy of record, would of  itself, without the evidence of numerous other learned women of Talmud  fame, prove, were proof necessary, the honorable position occupied by  Jewish women in those days. Long before Schiller, the Talmud said:[28]  \"Honor women, because they bring blessing.\" Of Abraham it is said: \"It  was well with him, because of his wife Sarah.\" Again: \"More glorious is  the promise made to women, than that to men: In Isaiah (xxxii. 9) we  read: 'Ye women that are at ease, hear my voice!' for, with women it  lies to inspire their husbands and sons with zeal for the study of the  Law, the most meritorious of deeds.\" Everywhere the Talmud sounds the  praise of the virtuous woman of Proverbs and of the blessings of a happy  family life.    A single Talmudic sentence, namely, \"He who teaches his daughter the  Law, teaches her what is unworthy,\" torn from its context, and falsely  interpreted, has given rise to most absurd theories with regard to the  views of Talmudic times on the matter of woman's education. It should be  taken into consideration that its author, who is responsible also for  the sentiment that \"woman's place is at the distaff,\" was the husband of  Ima Shalom, a clever, highly cultured, but irascible woman, who was on  intimate terms with Jewish Christians, and was wont to interfere in the  disputations carried on by men--in short, a representative Talmudic  blue-stocking, with all the attributes with which fancy would be prone  to invest such a one.[29]    Elsewhere the Talmud tells about Rabbi Nachman's wife Yaltha, the proud  and learned daughter of a princely line. Her guest, the poor itinerant  preacher Rabbi Ulla, expressed the opinion that according to the Law it  was not necessary to pass the wine-cup over which the blessing has been  said to women. The opinion, surely not the withheld wine, so angered his  hostess, that she shivered four hundred wine-pitchers, letting their  contents flow over the ground.[30] If the rabbis had such incidents in  mind, crabbed utterances were not unjustifiable. Perhaps every  rabbinical antagonist to woman's higher education was himself the victim  of a learned wife, who regaled him, after his toilsome research at the  academy, with unpalatable soup, or, worse still, with Talmudic  discussions. Instances are abundant of erudite rabbis tormented by their  wives. One, we are told, refused to cook for her husband, and another,  day after day, prepared a certain dish, knowing that he would not touch  it.    But this is pleasantry. It would betray total ignorance of the Talmud  and the rabbis to impute to them the scorn of woman prevalent at that  time. The Talmud and its sages never weary of singing the praise of  women, and at every occasion inculcate respect for them, and devotion to  their service. The compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud, Rabbi Jochanan,  whose life is crowned with the aureole of romance, pays a delicate  tribute to woman by the question: \"Who directed the"]]]
