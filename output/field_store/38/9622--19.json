Rich in natural    resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products,    minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for more    than 80% of the value of total exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a    downturn in world commodity prices can have a big impact on the    economy. The government is pushing for increased exports of    manufactured goods, but competition in international markets    continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low growth    and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the early    1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the prolonged    recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak world    demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so strongly in 1994    that the government felt the need for fiscal and monetary tightening    by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994, largely due to    increases in industrial output and business investment. A severe    drought in 1994 reduced the value of Australia's net farm    production, but rising world commodity prices are likely to boost    commodity exports by 15% to $42.4 billion in 1995/96, according to    government statistics. Short-term economic problems include a    balancing of output growth and inflationary pressures and the    stimulation of exports to offset rising imports.

The economy, and especially    the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the    effects of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996.    Increased activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the    growth of the construction sector, contributed to economic growth in    1997-98. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into    developing the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of    financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the    medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism    sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the    industrialized nations.
