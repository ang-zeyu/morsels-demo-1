Among the young princes of his  household there was one, Crimthann, son of Ae, King of Leinster, whom  the High King preferred to the others over whom he held fatherly sway.  Nor was this wonderful, for the lad loved him also, and was as eager and  intelligent and modest as becomes a prince.    The High King and Crimthann would often set out from Tara to hunt and  hawk, sometimes unaccompanied even by a servant; and on these excursions  the king imparted to his foster-son his own wide knowledge of forest  craft, and advised him generally as to the bearing and duties of a  prince, the conduct of a court, and the care of a people.    Dermod mac Ae delighted in these solitary adventures, and when he  could steal a day from policy and affairs he would send word privily to  Crimthann. The boy, having donned his hunting gear, would join the king  at a place arranged between them, and then they ranged abroad as chance  might direct.    On one of these adventures, as they searched a flooded river to find the  ford, they saw a solitary woman in a chariot driving from the west.    \"I wonder what that means?\" the king exclaimed thoughtfully.    \"Why should you wonder at a woman in a chariot?\" his companion inquired,  for Crimthann loved and would have knowledge.    \"Good, my Treasure,\" Dermod answered, \"our minds are astonished when we  see a woman able to drive a cow to pasture, for it has always seemed to  us that they do not drive well.\"    Crimthann absorbed instruction like a sponge and digested it as rapidly.    \"I think that is justly said,\" he agreed.    \"But,\" Dermod continued, \"when we see a woman driving a chariot of two  horses, then we are amazed indeed.\"    When the machinery of anything is explained to us we grow interested,  and Crimthann became, by instruction, as astonished as the king was.    \"In good truth,\" said he, \"the woman is driving two horses.\"    \"Had you not observed it before?\" his master asked with kindly malice.    \"I had observed but not noticed,\" the young man admitted.    \"Further,\" said the king, \"surmise is aroused in us when we discover a  woman far from a house; for you will have both observed and noticed that  women are home-dwellers, and that a house without a woman or a woman  without a house are imperfect objects, and although they be but half  observed, they are noticed on the double.\"    \"There is no doubting it,\" the prince answered from a knitted and  thought-tormented brow.    \"We shall ask this woman for information about herself,\" said the king  decidedly.    \"Let us do so,\" his ward agreed    \"The king's majesty uses the words 'we' and 'us' when referring to  the king's majesty,\" said Dermod, \"but princes who do not yet  rule territories must use another form of speech when referring to  themselves.\"    \"I am very thoughtless,\" said Crimthann humbly.    The king kissed him on both cheeks.    \"Indeed, my dear heart and my son, we are not scolding you, but you must  try not to look so terribly thoughtful when you think. It is part of the  art of a ruler.\"    \"I shall never master that hard art,\" lamented his fosterling.    \"We must all master it,\" Dermod replied. \"We may think with our minds  and with our tongues, but we should never think with our noses and with  our eyebrows.\"    The woman in the chariot had drawn nigh to the ford by which they were  standing, and, without pause, she swung her steeds into the shallows and  came across the river in a tumult of foam and spray.    \"Does she not drive well?\" cried Crimthann admiringly.    \"When you are older,\" the king counselled him, \"you will admire that  which is truly admirable, for although the driving is good the lady is  better.\"    He continued with enthusiasm.    \"She is in truth a wonder of the world and an endless delight to the  eye.\"    She was all that and more, and, as she took the horses through the river  and lifted them up the bank, her flying hair and parted lips and all the  young strength and grace of her body went into the king's eye and could  not easily come out again.    Nevertheless, it was upon his ward that the lady's gaze rested, and if  the king could scarcely look away from her, she could, but only with an  equal effort, look away from Crimthann.    \"Halt there!\" cried the king.    \"Who should I halt for?\" the lady demanded, halting all the same, as is  the manner of women, who rebel against command and yet receive it.    \"Halt for Dermod!\"    \"There are Dermods and Dermods in this world,\" she quoted.    \"There is yet but one Ard-Ri',\" the monarch answered.    She then descended from the chariot and made her reverence.    \"I wish to know your name?\" said he.    But at this demand the lady frowned and answered decidedly:    \"I do not wish to tell it.\"    \"I wish to know also where you come from and to what place you are  going?\"    \"I do not wish to tell any of these things.\"    \"Not to the king!\"    \"I do not wish to tell them to any one.\"    Crimthann was scandalised.    \"Lady,\" he pleaded, \"you will surely not withhold information from the  Ard-Ri'?\"    But the lady stared as royally on the High King as the High King did on  her, and, whatever it was he saw in those lovely eyes, the king did not  insist.    He drew Crimthann apart, for he withheld no instruction from that lad.    \"My heart,\" he said, \"we must always try to act wisely, and we should  only insist on receiving answers to questions in which we are personally  concerned.\"    Crimthann imbibed all the justice of that remark.    \"Thus I do not really require to know this lady's name, nor do I care  from what direction she comes.\"    \"You do not?\" Crimthann asked.    \"No, but what I do wish to know is, Will she marry me?\"    \"By my hand that is a notable question,\" his companion stammered.    \"It is a question that must be answered,\" the king cried triumphantly.  \"But,\" he continued, \"to learn what woman she is, or where she comes  from, might bring us torment as well as information. Who knows in what  adventures the past has engaged her!\"    And he stared for a profound moment on disturbing, sinister horizons,  and Crimthann meditated there with him.    \"The past is hers,\" he concluded, \"but the future is ours, and we shall  only demand that which is pertinent to the future.\"    He returned to the lady.    \"We wish you to be our wife,\" he said. And he gazed on her benevolently  and firmly and carefully when he said that, so that her regard could  not stray otherwhere. Yet, even as he looked, a tear did well into those  lovely eyes, and behind her brow a thought moved of the beautiful boy  who was looking at her from the king's side.    But when the High King of Ireland asks us to marry him we do not refuse,  for it is not a thing that we shall be asked to do every day in the  week, and there is no woman in the world but would love to rule it in  Tara.    No second tear crept on the lady's lashes, and, with her hand in the  king's hand, they paced together towards the palace, while behind them,  in melancholy mood, Crimthann mac Ae led the horses and the chariot.        CHAPTER II    They were married in a haste which equalled the king's desire; and as he  did not again ask her name, and as she did not volunteer to give it, and  as she brought no dowry to her husband and received none from him, she  was called Becfola, the Dowerless.    Time passed, and the king's happiness was as great as his expectation  of it had promised. But on the part of Becfola no similar tidings can be  given.    There are those whose happiness lies in ambition and station, and to  such a one the fact of being queen to the High King of Ireland is a  satisfaction at which desire is sated. But the mind of Becfola was not  of this temperate quality, and, lacking Crimthann, it seemed to her that  she possessed nothing.    For to her mind he was the sunlight in the sun, the brightness in the  moonbeam; he was the savour in fruit and the taste in honey; and when  she looked from Crimthann to the king she could not but consider that  the right man was in the wrong place. She thought that crowned only with  his curls Crlmthann mac Ae was more nobly diademed than are the masters  of the world, and she told him so.    His terror on hearing this unexpected news was so great that he  meditated immediate flight from Tara; but when a thing has been uttered  once it is easier said the second time and on the third repetition it is  patiently listened to.    After no great delay Crimthann mac Ae agreed and arranged that he and  Becfola should fly from Tara, and it was part of their understanding  that they should live happily ever after.    One morning, when not even a bird was astir, the king felt that his dear  companion was rising. He looked with one eye at the light that stole  greyly through the window, and recognised that it could not in justice  be called light.    \"There is not even a bird up,\" he murmured.    And then to Becfola.    \"What is the early rising for, dear heart?\"    \"An engagement I have,\" she replied.    \"This is not a time for engagements,\" said the calm monarch.    \"Let it be so,\" she replied, and she dressed rapidly.    \"And what is the engagement?\" he pursued.    \"Raiment that I left at a certain place and must have. Eight silken  smocks embroidered with gold, eight precious brooches of beaten gold,  three diadems of pure gold.\"    \"At this hour,\" said the patient king, \"the bed is better than the  road.\"    \"Let it be so,\" said she.    \"And moreover,\" he continued, \"a Sunday journey brings bad luck.\"    \"Let the luck come that will come,\" she answered.    \"To keep a cat from cream or a woman from her gear is not work for a  king,\" said the monarch severely.    The Ard-Ri' could look on all things with composure, and regard all  beings with a tranquil eye; but it should be known that there was one  deed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#16)"],[1,"roll, registrat in the books of Assembly, whereof the  tennour followeth.                      -------------------------------------    _The order of the Provincial Assemblies in_ Scotland, _according to the  Presbyteries therein contained._    1. _The Provincial Assembly of_ Mers _and_ Tividail.

And ordains the Commmissioners of this Assemblie to meane      the same to his Majestie, and to desire that a pecuniall paine may      be injoyned upon the contraveeners of this present act._\"          Act Sess. 14.

The clause touching the civill places and  power of Kirk-men, was referred unto the tryal of this Assembly; entered  into a serious search thereof, especially of their sitting on the bench,  as Justices of peace, their sitting in Session and Councel, their riding  and voting in Parlament: and considering how this vote in Parliament, was  not at first sought nor requyred by this Kirk, or worthy men of the  Ministerie, but being obtruded upon them, was disallowed for such reasons  as could not well be answered (as appeareth by the conference, holden at  _Halyrude-house_ 1599. which with the reasons therein contained was read  in the face of the Assembly) & by plurality of voices nor being able to  resist that enforced favour, they foreseeing the dangerous consequences  thereof, in the Assembly at _Montrose_ did limitate the same by many  necessare cautions: Considering also the protestation made in the  Parliament 1606 by Commissioners from Presbyteries, and provincial  Assemblies, against this restitution of Bishops to vote in Parliament, and  against all civil offices in the persons of Pastors, separate unto the  Gospel, as incompatible with their spiritual function; with the manifold  reasons of that Protestation from the word of God, ancient Councels,  ancient and moderne Divines, from the Doctrine, discipline and Confession  of Faith of the Kirk of _Scotland_, which are extant in print, and were  read in the audience of the Assembly: Considering also from their own  experience the bad fruits and great evils, which have been the inseparable  consequents of these offices, and that power in the persons of Pastors  separate to the Gospel, to the great prejudice of the freedome and  libertie of the Kirk, the jurisdiction of her Assemblies, and the powerful  fruits of their spiritual Ministerie; The Assembly most unanimously in one  voice, with the hesitation of two allanerly, declared, that as on the one  part the Kirk and the Ministers thereof are oblidged to give their advise  and good counsel in matters concerning the Kirk or the Conscience of any  whatsomever, to his Majestie, to the Parliament, to the Councel, or to any  members thereof, for their resolutions from the word of God, So on the  other part, that it is both in-expedient, and unlawful in this Kirk, for  Pastors separate unto the Gospel to brook civil places, and offices, as to  be Justices of peace; sit and decerne in Councel, Session, or Exchecker;  to ride or vote in Parliament, to be Judges or Assessors in any Civil  Judicatorie: and therefore rescinds and annuls, all contrarie acts of"]]]
