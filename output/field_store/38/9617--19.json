But the chief-justice  seized these men and had them tortured; and on their confession that  they also were implicated in Andre's murder, he condemned them to the  same punishment as the others. Dona Cancha alone, by reason of her  situation, escaped the torture, and her sentence was deferred till the  day of her confinement.    As this beautiful girl was returning to prison, with many a smile for  all the handsomest cavaliers she could see in the crowd, she gave a sign  to Charles of Durazzo as she neared him to come forward, and since her  tongue had not been pierced (for the same reason) with an iron  instrument, she said some words to him a while in a low voice.    Charles turned fearfully pale, and putting his hand to his sword,  cried--    \"Wretched woman!\"    \"You forget, my lord, I am under the protection of the law.\"    \"My mother!--oh, my poor mother!\" murmured Charles in a choked voice,  and he fell backward.    The next morning the people were beforehand with the executioner, loudly  demanding their prey. All the national troops and mercenaries that the  judicial authorities could command were echelonned in the streets,  opposing a sort of dam to the torrent of the raging crowd. The sudden  insatiable cruelty that too often degrades human nature had awaked in  the populace: all heads were turned with hatred and frenzy; all  imaginations inflamed with the passion for revenge; groups of men and  women, roaring like wild beasts, threatened to knock down the walls of  the prison, if the condemned were not handed over to them to take to the  place of punishment: a great murmur arose, continuous, ever the same,  like the growling of thunder: the queen's heart was petrified with  terror.    But, in spite of the desire of Bertram de Baux to satisfy the popular  wish, the preparations for the solemn execution were not completed till  midday, when the sun's rays fell scorchingly upon the town. There went  up a mighty cry from ten thousand palpitating breasts when a report  first ran through the crowd that the prisoners were about to appear.  There was a moment of silence, and the prison doors rolled slowly back  on their hinges with a rusty, grating noise. A triple row of horsemen,  with lowered visor and lance in rest, started the procession, and amid  yells and curses the condemned prisoners came out one by one, each tied  upon a cart, gagged and naked to the waist, in charge of two  executioners, whose orders were to torture them the whole length of  their way. On the first cart was the former laundress of Catana,  afterwards wife of the grand seneschal and governess to the queen,  Philippa of Cabane: the two executioners at right and left of her  scourged her with such fury that the blood spurting up from the wounds  left a long track in all the streets passed by the cortege.    Immediately following their mother on separate carts came the Countesses  of Terlizzi and Morcone, the elder no more than eighteen years of age.  The two sisters were so marvellously beautiful that in the crowd a  murmur of surprise was heard, and greedy eyes were fixed upon their  naked trembling shoulders. But the men charged to torture them gazed  with ferocious smiles upon their forms of seductive beauty, and, armed  with sharp knives, cut off pieces of their flesh with a deliberate  enjoyment and threw them out to the crowd, who eagerly struggled to get  them, signing to the executioners to show which part of the victims'  bodies they preferred.    Robert of Cabane, the grand seneschal, the Counts of Terlizzi and  Morcone, Raymond Pace, brother of the old valet who had been executed  the day before, and many more, were dragged on similar carts, and both  scourged with ropes and slashed with knives; their flesh was torn out  with red-hot pincers, and flung upon brazen chafing-dishes. No cry of  pain was heard from the grand seneschal, he never stirred once in his  frightful agony; yet the torturers put such fury into their work that  the poor wretch was dead before the goal was reached.    In the centre of the square of Saint Eligius an immense stake was set  up: there the prisoners were taken, and what was left of their mutilated  bodies was thrown into the flames. The Count of Terlizzi and the grand  seneschal's widow were still alive, and two tears of blood ran down the  cheeks of the miserable mother as she saw her son's corpse and the  palpitating remains of her two daughters cast upon the fire--they by  their stifled cries showed that they had not ceased to suffer. But  suddenly a fearful noise overpowered the groans of the victims; the  enclosure was broken and overturned by the mob. Like madmen, they rushed  at the burning pile,--armed with sabres, axes, and knives, and snatching  the bodies dead or alive from the flames, tore them to pieces, carrying  off the bones to make whistles or handles for their daggers as a  souvenir of this horrible day.          CHAPTER VI      The spectacle of this frightful punishment did not satisfy the revenge  of Charles of Durazzo. Seconded by the chief-justice, he daily brought  about fresh executions, till Andre's death came to be no more than a  pretext for the legal murder of all who opposed his projects. But Louis  of Tarentum, who had won Joan's heart, and was eagerly trying to get the  necessary dispensation for legalising the marriage, from this time  forward took as a personal insult every act of the high court of justice  which was performed against his will and against the queen's  prerogative: he armed all his adherents, increasing their number by all  the adventurers he could get together, and so put on foot a strong  enough force to support his own party and resist his cousin. Naples was  thus split up into hostile camps, ready to come to blows on the smallest  pretext, whose daily skirmishes, moreover, were always followed by some  scene of pillage or death.    But Louis had need of money both to pay his mercenaries and to hold his  own against the Duke of Durazzo and his own brother Robert, and one day  he discovered that the queen's coffers were empty. Joan was wretched and  desperate, and her lover, though generous and brave and anxious to  reassure her so far as he could, did not very clearly see how to  extricate himself from such a difficult situation. But his mother  Catherine, whose ambition was satisfied in seeing one of her sons, no  matter which, attain to the throne of Naples, came unexpectedly to their  aid, promising solemnly that it would only take her a few days to be  able to lay at her niece's feet a treasure richer than anything she had  ever dreamed of, queen as she was.    The empress then took half her son's troops, made for Saint Agatha, and  besieged the fortress where Charles and Bertrand of Artois had taken  refuge when they fled from justice. The old count, astonished at the  sight of this woman, who had been the very soul of the conspiracy, and  not in the least understanding her arrival as an enemy, sent out to ask  the intention of this display of military force. To which Catherine  replied in words which we translate literally:    \"My friends, tell Charles, our faithful friend, that we desire to speak  with him privately and alone concerning a matter equally interesting to  us both, and he is not to be alarmed at our arriving in the guise of an  enemy, for this we have done designedly, as we shall explain in the  course of our interview. We know he is confined to bed by the gout, and  therefore feel no surprise at his not coming out to meet us. Have the  goodness to salute him on our part and reassure him, telling him that we  desire to come in, if such is his good pleasure, with our intimate  counsellor, Nicholas Acciajuoli, and ten soldiers only, to speak with  him concerning an important matter that cannot be entrusted to  go-betweens.\"    Entirely reassured by these frank, friendly explanations, Charles of  Artois sent out his son Bertrand to the empress to receive her with the  respect due to her rank and high position at the court of Naples.  Catherine went promptly to the castle with many signs of joy, and  inquiring after the count's health and expressing her affection, as soon  as they were alone, she mysteriously lowered her voice and explained  that the object of her visit was to consult a man of tried experience on  the affairs of Naples, and to beg his active cooperation in the queen's  favour. As, however, she was not pressed for time, she could wait at  Saint Agatha for the count's recovery to hear his views and tell him of  the march of events since he left the court. She succeeded so well in  gaining the old man's confidence and banishing his suspicions, that he  begged her to honour them with her presence as long as she was able, and  little by little received all her men within the walls. This was what  Catherine was waiting for: on the very day when her army was installed  at Saint Agatha, she suddenly entered the count's room, followed by four  soldiers, and seizing the old man by the throat, exclaimed wrathfully--    \"Miserable traitor, you will not escape from our hands before you have  received the punishment you deserve. In the meanwhile, show me where  your treasure is hidden, if you would not have me throw your body out to  feed the crows that are swooping around these dungeons.\"    The count, half choking, the dagger at his breast, did not even attempt  to call for help; he fell on his knees, begging the empress to save at  least the life of his son, who was not yet well from the terrible attack  of melancholia that had shaken his reason ever since the catastrophe.  Then he painfully dragged himself to the place where he had hidden his  treasure, and pointing with his finger, cried--    \"Take all; take my life; but spare my son.\"    Catherine could not contain herself for joy when she saw spread out at  her feet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1," 0-14 years: 44.6% (male 7,095,117/female 6,763,759)    15-64 years: 53% (male 8,436,716/female 8,008,463)    65 years and over: 2.4% (male 366,642/female 386,300) (2006 est.)
