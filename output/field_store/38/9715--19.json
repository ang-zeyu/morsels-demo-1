If, on  the other hand, we survey the species, we find it in every variety of  size, and shape, and disposition, according to the various services of  which it is capable. The division of labor is almost as complete, among  the different species of the dog, as among men themselves. It, like its  masters, gives up the exercise of one faculty that it may bring another  to a greater perfection.    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--The anecdotes which go to display the  intelligence and fidelity of dogs, are almost innumerable. Of these, we  can give only a few specimens. \"My dog Sirrah,\" says the Ettrick  shepherd, \"was, beyond all comparison, the best dog I ever saw. He was  of a surly and unsocial temper. Disdaining all flattery, he refused to  be caressed; but his attention to my commands and interests will never  again, perhaps, be equalled by any of the canine race. When I first saw  him, a drover was leading him in a rope. He was both lean and hungry,  and far from being a beautiful animal, for he was almost all black, and  had a grim face, striped with dark-brown. The man had bought him of a  boy, somewhere on the Border, for three shillings, and had fed him  very ill on his journey. I thought I discovered a sort of sullen  intelligence in his countenance, notwithstanding his dejected and  forlorn appearance. I gave the drover a guinea for him, and I believe  there never was a guinea so well laid out; at least, I am satisfied I  never laid one out to so good a purpose. He was scarcely a year old,  and knew so little of herding, that he had never turned a sheep in his  life; but as soon as he discovered that it was his duty to do so, and  that it obliged me, I can never forget with what anxiety and eagerness  he learned his different evolutions. He would try every way  deliberately, till he found out what I wanted him to do; and, when I  once made him understand a direction, he never forgot or mistook it  again. Well as I knew him, he often astonished me; for, when hard  pressed in accomplishing the task that he was put to, he had expedients  of the moment that bespoke a great share of the reasoning faculty.\"    Among other remarkable exploits of Sirrah, illustrative of his  sagacity, Mr. Hogg relates that, upon one occasion, about seven hundred  lambs, which were under his care at weaning time, broke up at midnight,  and scampered off, in three divisions, across the neighboring hills, in  spite of all that he and an assistant could do to keep them together.  The night was so dark that he could not see Sirrah; but the faithful  animal heard his master lament their absence in words which, of all  others, were sure to set him most on the alert; and, without more ado,  he silently set off in quest of the recreant flock. Meanwhile, the  shepherd and his companion did not fail to do all in their power to  recover their lost charge; they spent the whole night in scouring the  hills for miles round, but of neither the lambs nor Sirrah could they  obtain the slightest trace. It was the most extraordinary circumstance  that had ever occurred in the annals of pastoral life. They had nothing  to do, as day had dawned, but to return to their master, and inform him  that they had lost his whole flock of lambs, and knew not what was  become of one of them. \"On our way home, however,\" says Mr. Hogg, \"we  discovered a lot of lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine called the  Flesh Cleuch, and the indefatigable Sirrah standing in front of them,  looking round for some relief, but still true to his charge. The sun  was then up; and when we first came in view, we concluded that it was  one of the divisions, which Sirrah had been unable to manage until he  came to that commanding situation. But what was our astonishment when  we discovered that not one lamb of the whole flock was wanting! How he  had got all the divisions collected in the dark is beyond my  comprehension. The charge was left entirely to himself from midnight  until the rising sun; and if all the shepherds in the Forest had been  there to have assisted him, they could not have effected it with  greater propriety. All that I can further say is, that I never felt so  grateful to any creature under the sun, as I did to my honest Sirrah  that morning.\"    Sir Walter Scott has furnished an anecdote on this subject, concerning  a dog, which, though meritorious in himself, must ever deserve the  greatest share of fame and interest from the circumstance of having  belonged to such a master. \"The wisest dog,\" says Sir Walter, \"I ever  had, was what is called the bull-dog terrier. I taught him to  understand a great many words, insomuch that I am positive that the  communication betwixt the canine species and ourselves might be greatly  enlarged. Camp once bit the baker, who was bringing bread to the  family. I beat him, and explained the enormity of his offence; after  which, to the last moment of his life, he never heard the least  allusion to the story, in whatever voice or tone it was mentioned,  without getting up and retiring into the darkest corner of the room,  with great appearance of distress. Then, if you said, 'The baker was  well paid,' or 'The baker was not hurt after all,' Camp came forth from  his hiding-place, capered, barked, and rejoiced. When he was unable,  towards the end of his life, to attend me when on horseback, he used to  watch for my return, and the servant used to tell him 'his master was  coming down the hill, or through the moor;' and although he did not use  any gesture to explain his meaning, Camp was never known to mistake  him, but either went out at the front to go up the hill, or at the back  to get down to the moor-side. He certainly had a singular knowledge of  spoken language.\"    It has been made a question, whether the dog remembers his master after  a long period of separation. The voice of antiquity favors the  affirmative. Homer makes the dog of Ulysses to recognize him after many  years' absence, and describes Eumenes, the swineherd, as being thus led  to apprehend, in the person before him, the hero, of seeing whom he had  long despaired. Byron, on the other hand, was skeptical on this point.  Writing to a friend, who had requested the results of his experience on  the subject,--he states that, on seeing a large dog, which had belonged  to him, and had formerly been a favorite, chained at Newstead, the  animal sprang towards him, as he conceived, in joy--but he was glad to  make his escape from it, with the comparatively trivial injury of the  loss of the skirts of his coat. Perhaps this circumstance may have  suggested the following verses of the poet:--        \"And now I'm in the world alone,        Upon the wide, wide sea;      But why should I for others groan,        When none will sigh for me?      Perchance my dog will whine in vain,        Till fed by stranger hands;      But long ere I come back again,        He'd tear me where he stands.\"    The affection of the dog for his master does not end with his life; and  innumerable are the anecdotes on record of dogs, which have continued  to pine after their master's death, or died immediately after. We shall  select but one or two well-authenticated instances, for they are all so  much alike, that it is unnecessary to produce many. It is said, in the  Life of Mary, Queen of Scots, lately published at Glasgow, that, after  her head was cut off, her little favorite lapdog, which had  affectionately followed her, and unobserved had nestled among her  clothes, now continued to caress her, and would not leave the body till  forced away, and then died two days afterwards.    Mr. Renton, of Lammerton, had a herdsman, who, pursuing a sheep that  had run down the steep bank of Blackadder Water, fell into the river  and was drowned. His dog, a common shepherd's dog, returned home next  morning, and led his wife to the spot, holding her by the apron. The  body was found. The dog followed it even to the grave, and died in a  few days.    A mastiff dog belonging to the Honorable Peter Bold, England, attended  his master in his chamber during the tedious sickness consequent on a  pulmonary consumption. After the gentleman expired, and his corpse had  been removed, the dog repeatedly entered the apartment, making a  mournful, whining noise; he continued his researches for several days  through all the rooms of the house, but in vain. He then retired to his  kennel, which he could not be induced to leave; refusing all manner of  sustenance, he soon died. Of this fact, and his previous affection, the  surgeon who attended his master was an eye-witness.    The regret of the dog for its master's death is not confined to  inactive sorrow; if his death has been caused by violence, it discovers  a singular and persevering hatred of the murderers, which in some cases  has led to their detection. The following instance is related in a  letter, written in 1764, by a gentleman at Dijon, in France, to his  friend in London: \"Since my arrival here, a man has been broken on the  wheel, with no other proof to condemn him than that of a water-spaniel.  The circumstances attending it being so very singular and striking, I  beg leave to communicate them to you. A farmer, who had been to receive  a sum of money, was waylaid, robbed, and murdered, by two villains. The  farmer's dog returned with all speed to the house of the person who had  paid the money, and expressed such amazing anxiety that he would follow  him, pulling him several times by the sleeve and skirt of the coat,  that at length the gentleman yielded to his importunity. The dog led  him to the field, a little from the roadside, where the body lay. From  thence the gentleman went to a public house, in order to alarm the  country. The moment he entered, (as the two villains were there  drinking,) the dog seized the murderer by the throat, and the other  made his escape. This man "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#16)"],[1," currently recognized range of a  single subspecies of Caribou (_Rangifer arcticus arcticus_), as follows:  _Canis lupus arctos_, Prince of Wales and Somerset islands; _Canis lupus  manningi_, Baffin Island; _Canis lupus bernardi_, Victoria Island;  _Canis lupus hudsonicus_, Keewatin, eastern Mackenzie, northern  Manitoba, and northeastern Saskatchewan; _Canis lupus mackenzii_,  northern Mackenzie; _Canis lupus occidentalis_, southern Mackenzie and  northern Alberta and Saskatchewan.    The Keewatin Tundra Wolf (_C. l. hudsonicus_) is presumably the only one  that concerns us here. However, its extension into the forested zone of  northern Manitoba and northeastern Saskatchewan, as indicated on  Goldman's map, is still problematical. Goldman's text (1944: 428-429) is  quite indefinite on this point. There are such distinct differences  between the general fauna of the Arctic Zone and that of the Hudsonian  Zone that the Wolf of the latter zone may well prove to be  differentiable from _hudsonicus_, whose type locality is at Schultz Lake  in west central Keewatin. It is an interesting question whether any  Wolves of the Barren Grounds follow the Caribou southward into the  timbered country in the fall; likewise, whether any individual Wolves of  the latter region accompany the Caribou on their spring migration out  into the Barrens. Little light on the subject seems available at  present. There is no doubt, however, that a good many Wolves remain  during the winter on parts of the Barren Grounds that have been deserted  by the Caribou at that season. Furthermore, at the time of the spring  migration, mature Wolves of the forest zone would be restricted to their  home territory by the necessity of caring for their young ones.    A Wolf is by no means able to capture a Caribou at will. During the  season of open water the latter may effect a ready escape by plunging  into the nearest river or lake and crossing to the other side. There is  reason to believe that islands provide a good sanctuary during the  summer (Seton, 1929, +3+: 108-109; Gavin, 1945: 228). In the winter the  Caribou must depend primarily on its fleetness of foot. Even the fawns  are reputed to be able to outdistance Wolves in a chase that is not too  prolonged. An adult, if brought to bay after a long chase, is probably  able to stand off a single Wolf indefinitely. Its powerful hoofs are its  principal means of defense. Even if the antlers are brought into play,  they are effective only during the limited period when they are  fullgrown, hard, and free of velvet. When two or more Wolves manage to  bring a Caribou to bay, the outcome is probably almost invariably in  their favor. Charles Schweder has never known a Caribou to kill one of  these predators in defending itself. In several cases reported by Fred  Schweder, Jr., the last stand was made on the ice of lakes. The Caribou  itself may choose such a place, as if aware that it may be more  sure-footed on the ice than its enemy.    After listening to wolf tales by residents of the frontier settlements  rather than by real men of the \"bush,\" one might almost expect to see a  couple of these bloodthirsty animals harrying the rear of every band of  Caribou and keeping up a relentless pursuit. However, during a sojourn  of six months on one of the best Caribou ranges in Keewatin, where  trapping has very little effect on Wolves, I saw just one of these  animals alive, heard the howling on several occasions, and noted a  single Caribou that had probably been killed by them. It is far from a  common experience for the resident trappers to witness actual pursuit by  Wolves or even to find their kills. The following instances, related by  Fred Schweder, Jr., comprised his only direct observations on Wolves in  pursuit of Caribou up to and including 1947, when he was eighteen years  old.    During the northward migration in May, 1945, a silent black Wolf pursued  a band of 100 Caribou over the ice of Windy Bay. At one time it came  within 100 feet, but thereafter they forged ahead. After half a mile the  band split up, and the Wolf desisted. In October, 1946, Fred noticed a  Caribou fighting off two Wolves on the ice of Nueltin Lake near its  outlet. It used both horns and hoofs against its attackers. While one  Wolf was in front, the other would try to get in the rear of the Caribou  and hamstring it. This went on for two hours until darkness hid the  scene. The next morning the Caribou was dead and half eaten. On October  16, 1947, a white Wolf was seen in pursuit of four fast-moving Caribou  near Simons' Lake. It was about half a mile in their rear, and presently  halted, probably by reason of catching sight of Fred.    November 7, 1947, was a blizzardy day; the air was full of drifting  snow. Under these conditions a gray Wolf chased a buck and a doe right  into the dooryard of one of Fred's trapping camps 10 miles north of  Windy River. It was only about 30 feet behind them. When the buck broke  through the ice of a little creek, the Wolf went right past it in  pursuit of the doe. The latter nearly ran into Fred's toboggan, and he  shot it at a distance of 20 feet. The Wolf came within 40 feet, but by  the time it was recognized as not just another Caribou, it was 100 feet  away. Fred then shot but merely wounded it, the sight being off his  rifle. Meanwhile the buck escaped, but 3 miles away Fred met with it  again and secured it. He recognized it as the same animal because at  both encounters it was limping from a previous wound and was hornless as  well.    In late November Fred found two fullgrown bucks and a doe on the ice of  Windy Lake, where they had been killed by Wolves. The bucks were  antlered and had probably met their end several weeks previously. Yet  their flesh was so musky and unpalatable, in consequence of the rutting  season, that it had not been devoured. A long trail of blood and hair  led to the spot where the doe had fallen, apparently a couple of weeks  previously; it was still only half eaten.    In Fred's opinion, Caribou are apprehensive of sandy eskers as the haunt  of Wolves, and do not linger there.    On October 15 Charles Schweder pointed out the body of a Caribou in a  little pond in the delta area at the head of Simons' Lake. He considered  it killed by Wolves some weeks previously; its antlers were in the  velvet, and it had been eaten only about the head and hind quarters as  it lay in the water.    Joe Chambers, a trapper of Goose Creek (south of Churchill), stated that  Wolves select the fattest Caribou, and that during the winter of 1946-47  they had been devouring only such choice parts as the tongue and the  unborn young.    Caribou bodies are the primary bait for Wolves and Foxes on the Barren  Grounds. Two traps are commonly placed at each carcass.    Up to a couple of centuries ago, when the baneful effect of civilized  man began to be felt, the Caribou throve and multiplied to a point where  they probably strained the grazing capacity of the Barren Grounds.  Neither primitive man nor the Wolf had any serious effect on the size or  condition of the herds. The Caribou were numbered by millions, and they  doubtless owed their vigor and their success as a species in no small  measure to their friendly enemy, the Wolf. Through long ages the latter  had tended to eliminate the weaklings, the sickly, and the less alert  individuals, leaving the fitter animals to propagate their kind. Here  was a fine example of natural selection operating to the advantage of  the Caribou. Thus the Wolf may be safely considered a benefactor of the  species as a whole--a regulator and protector of its vitality.    There are only two regions of the world where Caribou (or Reindeer) have  not long shared their territory with the Wolf--Spitsbergen and the Queen  Charlotte Islands. And what sort of situation do we find there? Instead  of thriving in the absence of such a natural predator, the animals of  both regions are the runts of the whole Caribou-Reindeer tribe, and  those of the Queen Charlottes have become virtually or wholly extinct  (_cf._ Banfield, 1949: 481-482). Furthermore, the Newfoundland Caribou  suffered a very serious decline after the Newfoundland Wolf became  extinct at about the beginning of the present century. The lesson is  obvious: it is folly for man to imagine that he can benefit the Caribou  by eliminating the Wolves.    It is virtually axiomatic that no predatory species (other than modern  man) exterminates its own food supply. Long ago nature must have  established a fairly definite ratio between the populations of the Wolf  and the Caribou. Although a certain fluctuation of that ratio could be  expected from time to time, each fluctuation would be followed by a  return to more or less normal conditions. The trend of evolution has  doubtless been toward perfecting the Wolf in its ability to capture the  Caribou, but at the same time toward perfecting the Caribou in its  ability to escape the Wolf. Unequal progress of this sort on the part of  the two species would presumably have been rather disastrous to the one  or the other. But it is nature's way to have preserved a proper balance  between the abilities of the two species, and thus between their  populations. This balance (a rather delicate one) has probably been  upset to some extent by the advent of civilized man with his devices to  the Barren Grounds.    The Caribou \"exemplify the survival of the fittest; none but the perfect  are allowed to live and breed, hence their perfection. We believe that  the wolf is in no small degree responsible for this high standard,  and that were he killed off the species as a whole would suffer.\"  (Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 161.)    \"It is doubtful if the efforts of white or native hunters are of any  importance whatever in the control of wolves in the caribou country, or  could, under present circumstances ever be of any importance.\" (Clarke,  1940: 109).
