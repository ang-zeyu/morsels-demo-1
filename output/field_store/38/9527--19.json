She sat with Constance and Marjorie in the  first row of the gallery, while beside her sat none other than Miss  Archer, whom they had encountered on their way to the high school and  who had invited them to take seats in the front row with her. She had  already met Mrs. Dean at the church which both women attended and had  conceived an instant liking for the pretty, gracious woman who looked  little older than her daughter.    \"Wasn't it nice of Miss Archer to ask us to sit here?\" whispered  Marjorie in her friend's ear. \"We have mother to thank for it. She is so  dear that no one can help liking her.\" Marjorie looked adoring  admiration at her mother's clear-cut profile. \"Do you suppose anyone  will mistake us for faculty?\"    Both girls giggled softly at such an improbability.    \"I never went to a basketball game before,\" confessed Constance after a  time. \"What are those girls over there in the red paper hats and big red  bows going to do?\"    \"Oh, that's the sophomore class. They lead their class in the songs. The  green and purple girls are the freshman chorus.\"    \"I didn't even know our class colors were green and purple.\"    \"You didn't! Why, that's the reason you and I wore violets to the dance.  Almost every freshman had them.\"    \"Oh, look!\" Constance's eyes were fixed upon a tiny purple figure that  had just emerged from a side door in the gymnasium and was walking  slowly across the big floor. Immediately afterward a door opened on the  opposite side and a diminutive scarlet-clad boy flashed forth.    \"They are the mascots,\" explained Marjorie, her gaze on the two children  who advanced to the center of the room and gravely shook hands. Then the  boy in red announced in a high, clear treble: \"Ladies and gentlemen, the  noble sophomores!\"    The door swung wide and a band of lithe blue figures, bearing a huge  letter \"S\" done in scarlet on the fronts of their blouses, pattered into  the gymnasium, amid loud applause.    \"The valiant freshmen!\" piped the purple-clad youngster.    There was a rush of black-clad girls, with resplendent violet \"F's\"  ornamenting their breasts, another volley of cheers from the audience,  then a shrill blast from the referee's whistle rent the air, the teams  dropped into their places, the umpire, time-keeper and scorer took  their stations, and a tense silence settled over the audience.    The referee balanced the ball. Ellen Seymour and Mignon La Salle  gathered themselves for the toss. Up it went. The two players leaped for  it. The referee's whistle sounded again. The struggle for basketball  honors began.    A jubilant shout swelled from the throats of the watching freshmen and  their fans. Mignon had caught the ball. She sent it speeding toward  Helen Thornton, who fumbled it, and losing her head, threw it away  from, instead of to the basket. An audible sigh of disapproval came from  the freshman contingent as they beheld the ball pass into the hands of  the sophomores, who scored shortly afterward.    Now that the ball was in their hands the sophomores proceeded to show  their friends and opponents a few things about playing. They had the  advantage and they kept it. Try as the freshmen might, they could not  score. The first unlucky error on the part of Helen Thornton had seemed  to turn the tide against them. Toward the close of the first half they  managed to score, but all too soon the whistle blew, with the score 8 to  2 in favor of the sophomores.    Their fans went wild with delight and their chorus sang or rather  shouted gleefully their pet song, beginning,        \"Hail the sophomores, gallant band!      See how bold they take their stand!\"    to the tune of \"Hail Columbia,\" coming out noisily on the concluding  lines,        \"Firm and steadfast shall they be,      Marching on to victory;      As a band of players, they      Shall be conquerors to-day.\"    The freshmen answered with their song, \"The Freshmen's Brave Banner,\"  but they did not sing as spiritedly as they had before the beginning of  the game.    \"I wonder what Jerry and Irma think,\" commented Marjorie. Their two  chums had been detailed to sing in the freshman chorus, which accounted  for their absence from the Dean party.    \"Jerry looks awfully cross,\" returned Constance, scanning the opposite  side of the gallery where Jerry was singing lustily, her straight, heavy  brows drawn together in a savage scowl.    \"There goes the whistle!\" Marjorie leaned eagerly forward to see the  freshman team come in from the side room which they were using. Her  alert eyes noted that Muriel looked sulky, Mignon stormy, Susan Atwell  belligerent, Harriet Delaney offended, and that Helen Thornton, the  substitute who had replaced her, had been crying.    Marjorie felt a thrill of pity for the unfortunate substitute. It looked  as though she had spent an unhappy quarter of an hour in the little side  room.    The teams changed sides and hastened to their places. Again Mignon and  Ellen faced each other. Then the whistle shrilled and the second half of  the game was on.    From the beginning of the second half it looked as though the freshmen  might retrieve their early losses. They worked with might and main and  made no false moves. Slowly their score climbed to six. So far the  sophomores had gained nothing. Then Ellen Seymour made a spectacular  throw to the basket and brought her team up two points. With the  realization that they were facing defeat the freshmen rallied and made a  desperate effort to hold their own, bringing their count up to eight.    Two more points were gained and the score was tied, but the time was  growing short. Helen Thornton had the ball and was plainly trying to  elude the tantalizing sophomore who barred her way. She made a clumsy  feint of throwing the ball. It slipped from her fingers and rolled along  the floor. There was a mad scramble for it. Mignon and Ellen Seymour  leaped forward simultaneously.    The crowd in the gallery was aroused to the height of excitement.  Marjorie, breathless, leaned far over the gallery rail. She knew every  detail of the dear old game. She saw Mignon's and Ellen's heads close  together as they sprang; then she saw Mignon give a sly, vicious side  lunge which threw Ellen almost off her feet. In the instant it took  Ellen to recover herself the French girl had seized the ball and was off  with it. Eluding her pursuers, she balanced herself on her toes, and  threw her prize toward the freshman basket. But it never reached there.  A long blue figure shot straight up into the air. Elizabeth Corey, a  girl whose sensational plays had made her a lion during her freshman  year, had intercepted the flying ball. She sent it spinning through the  air toward the sophomore nearest their basket, whose willing hands  received it and threw it home.    Mignon's trickery had availed her little. The sophomores had won.          CHAPTER XIV    WHAT HAPPENED ON BLUE MONDAY      For the next ten minutes the air was rent with the lusty voices of the  sophomore chorus and the joyous cheers of their fans. No echoing song  arose from freshman lips. The vanquished team had already betaken  themselves to their quarters, but the sophomore players were holding an  impromptu reception on the ground they had so hotly contested.    Marjorie and Constance watched them eagerly.    \"Go downstairs, girls, and join the hero worshipers,\" smiled Miss  Archer. \"We will excuse you, won't we, Mrs. Dean?\"    \"Yes; after the fervent manner in which they hung over the railing it  would be cruel to keep them with us,\" smiled Mrs. Dean.    \"Let's find Jerry and Irma,\" said Marjorie, as they paused in the open  doorway of the gymnasium.    Hardly had she spoken, when Jerry's unmistakable tones rose behind her.  The stout girl was talking excitedly, a rising note of indignation in  her voice.    \"I tell you I saw her push against Ellen Seymour,\" she declared. \"You  must have seen her, too, Irma.\"    \"I thought so,\" admitted Irma, \"but I wasn't sure.\"    \"Well, I was. Oh, girls, we were just going upstairs to find you! Now  that you're here, let's go into the gym, and join the celebration. I  don't know how you feel about it, but I'm glad the sophomores won,\"  Jerry ended, with an emphatic wag of her head.    \"Listen, Jerry,\" said Marjorie, earnestly, \"you were talking so loudly  when you were behind us that I couldn't help hearing you. Did it seem to  you as though Mignon deliberately pushed against Ellen Seymour?\"    \"I know she did,\" reiterated Jerry. \"I watched her, for she is always  unfair and tricky. Anyone who has ever played on a team could tell. I'm  surprised that you----\" She stopped abruptly. \"I believe you saw her,  too. Confess, you did see her; now, didn't you?\"    Marjorie nodded.    \"Now's your chance to get even with her. Let's go to Miss Archer and  tell her,\" proposed the stout girl. \"She'll send for Ellen Seymour and  then, good-bye freshman basketball for a while. But what do you care?  You aren't on the team any more. It would serve them right at that.\"    \"Oh, no,\" Marjorie looked her horror at the bare idea of tale-bearing.    \"Just as you say,\" shrugged Jerry. They were still standing just inside  the door watching the sophomore team receiving congratulations, when  they beheld a familiar figure in a black gymnasium suit pause squarely  in front of Ellen Seymour. They saw Ellen start angrily, then a confused  murmur of voices arose and the circle of fans and players closed in  about the two girls.    \"What's happened?\" demanded Jerry. \"Come on, girls.\" She hurried toward  the crowd, the three girls at her heels. Even as they joined the throng  they heard Mignon declare in a tone freighted with malice! \"You  purposely pushed against me when we ran for the ball in our last play  and nearly threw me off my feet. You know that deliberate pushing,  striking or any kind of roughness is forbidden, and you could be  disqualified as a player. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#16)"],[1,"and believed this,  that France had had great wars, and wars cost a great deal. And so,  because he was the King, he had asked money of his subjects, just as  had always been done by other Kings.    \"Oh, but papa,\" cried the Dauphin, \"why did you do that? Why did you  not take my purse and pay out of that? You know that I receive every  day my purse filled with bright new francs and I could have helped you  easily. And, oh papa, do your people have more money than you have  yourself?\"    King Louis answered that a king receives all his money from the people,  but gives it all back to them again, that he governs those people, and  they owe him respect and obedience and have to pay taxes to him, and so  if he needs money he raises it by laying extra taxes upon them. Then he  asked, \"do you understand that, little Louis?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeed!\" The Dauphin was breathless with interest now, \"I  have been told about that, but I don't like it. It seems to me that if  a man is the king, he ought to have all the money and give it to the  people when they need it. They ought to ask him for it, not he ask  them.\"    To this the king agreed, but added with a sigh, that kings had so  misused their power and authority that the people no longer trusted  them, and that now a king could not pay out money unless the people  knew what it was to be used for, and were willing.    \"Have you used people's money, papa, without asking their leave?\" cried  Louis eagerly. \"Was that why they came to Versailles yesterday and were  so wicked to us? For those bad men and women were the people, weren't  they?\"    King Louis shook his head. \"No, my son,\" he said. \"The people can not  come to me in such great masses. They have to send representatives.  Those representatives I called to me at Versailles and asked of them  money for the outlays I had to make, but they asked things in return,  of me which I could not grant, either for my own sake or for yours, my  son, who are some day to be my successor. Then the people were led to  believe that I did not love them, but I am determined to show them that  I do love them and am ready to share everything with them. That is why  we have left lovely Versailles and come to live here, where we have to  do without so much that we enjoy. And we must try to be contented here  and share all the disagreeable things that the people have to bear,  which is what a true King should do.\"    The Dauphin had sat like an old man, listening, and now as his father  stopped speaking, the boy laid a hand on his breast, saying solemnly:    \"Papa, I have understood everything, and I am very much ashamed that I  complained at all. And I promise you I will take pains to give  everybody a good example. I will be happy and contented here.\"    And the Dauphin kept his word; he took pains to be contented, and never  said another word about Versailles, but tried to get all the pleasure  he could from the dreary old palace and its garden, so different from  that at Versailles, where the Dauphin had so much ground in which to  work. Here in the garden, there was only one small corner set aside for  the use of the royal family. This was surrounded by iron palings,  through which faces full of hate and malice would often peer at the  little Dauphin while he was busy gardening. One day he heard such words  and saw such threatening faces that he shrank back and ran to his  mother, who comforted him as best she could and said that he must be  brave and strong, or she would cry too, and that she must not do this  because it was exactly what the men who were trying to hurt their  feelings, wanted to see her do.    The boy's eyes flashed.    \"I will never complain again,\" he cried, \"and they shall never again  have the pleasure of seeing you or me cry if I can help it. But, mamma,  tell me--are there no good men in the world?\"    \"Yes, Louis,\" answered the queen. \"You must believe that all men are  good and treat them courteously, until you have proved the contrary. If  they refuse your friendly kindness, it will not be your fault, and you  will have done what is right, no matter what others do.\"    A shadow passed over the child's lovely face.    \"But, mamma,\" he said, \"all men are not good. The men who abused and  cursed us so were not good, and I could never be friendly to them,  never!\"    \"We will hope that we shall never see them again,\" said the queen, \"and  I wish you to be so kind and polite to everyone who comes here, that  all men may admire and respect their future king, even though he is  still a child.\"    \"I will be,\" cried the boy with spirit, \"so that you may be satisfied  with me, mamma. Just for that I will be so!\"    As Marie Antoinette was kissing the pretty boy who was her comforter,  the mayor of Paris and General Lafayette were announced, and the  Dauphin whispered to his mother:    \"That general was at Versailles with the bad men. I can _never_ be  kind to him.\"    \"Hush,\" whispered the Queen--\"For God's sake, do not let anybody hear  that. No--no--he does not belong to our enemies. He wishes us well.  Treat him kindly, my child.\"    And then Marie Antoinette took her son by the hand, and together they  met their distinguished guests, who had come with the unwelcome news  that, according to the old custom of the days of Henry the Fourth, the  people wished to have free access to the gardens of the Tuileries,  which freedom had been denied them since the coming of King Louis and  his family.    The queen was bitterly opposed to this, for it meant that, for her own  comfort and protection, she must only walk in the garden at certain  times and under escort, and she was speaking with proud and angry  fearlessness to the general about the matter, when the Dauphin left her  side and running forward, extended his hand to Lafayette, crying:    \"General, I should like to salute you. Mamma told me I must be polite  and kind to all who are good to us, and she said that you wish us well.  Let me, therefore, greet you kindly, and give you my hand.\"    As he spoke, he raised his blue eyes and looked smilingly and  trustingly into those of the general and then at his mother; and his  hearer, whose heart had just kindled with anger against Marie  Antoinette and her rebellious words, felt anger melt into admiration,  together with reverence and astonishment at the words of the manly  little Dauphin. Bending his knee, in stately grace, he pressed the  Dauphin's small hand to his lips and said gravely as to a comrade:    \"My prince, you have spoken as with the tongue of an angel, and I swear  to you and to your royal mother that I will never forget this moment.  The kiss I have impressed upon the hand of my future king is at once  the seal of a solemn vow and the oath of unchangeable fidelity and  devotion to my king and the royal family. Dauphin of France, you have  to-day gained a soldier for your throne who is prepared to shed his  last drop of blood for you and your house, and on whose loyalty you may  always count.\"    General Lafayette had tears in his eyes, and his noble face glowed with  emotion, while the child before him looked at him with wistful eyes and  a happy smile. Close by stood Marie Antoinette, her air of proud  defiance turned to one of gentle sweetness. She knew what that moment  meant in the history of France, and her heart thrilled with pride in  her little son, the Dauphin. Stooping, she kissed his golden hair, and  then, without an attempt to conceal the emotion, she finished her  conversation with the general and mayor, and then, making her adieus to  them beckoned to the Dauphin to go with her from the pavilion in which  the interview had taken place, and to return to the palace.    Instead of walking beside her, the Dauphin paused and asked:    \"Mamma, please let me walk alone. I want the people to see I am not  afraid, as they may think if I let you lead me. I want to be like the  Chevalier Bayard, that the Abbe talked to me about the other day. I  want to be _sans peur et sans reproche_--like Bayard.\"    The queen smiled through tears.    \"Very well, my chevalier,\" she said. \"You shall walk alone.\"    \"And before you, please. The knights always walk in advance of the  ladies, to protect them from danger. I am your knight, mamma, and I  want to be, as long as I live.\" And he added with a pretty, playful  bow, \"Will you allow it, my royal lady?\"    \"I allow it! So go in front, chevalier, little Louis. We will take the  same way we came.\"    The Dauphin sprang along the path for quite a distance, when he stopped  suddenly and turned round to the queen, who with her two footmen was  walking quietly behind him.    \"Well, Chevalier Bayard, what are you stopping for?\" asked the queen  with a smile.    \"I am waiting for you,\" he said gravely, \"because this is where my  knightly service commences, for it is here that danger begins.\"    \"It is true,\" said the Queen, and even as she spoke, there came to her  ears a sound of shouting as loud as the booming of cannon. \"Oh, my  child,\" cried Marie Antoinette, \"the sound is like the thundering of a  storm at sea! But such storms lie in God's hand and He protects those  who trust Him. Think of that, little Louis, and do not be afraid!\"    \"Oh, I am not afraid!\" cried Louis, running happily on. And yet,  outside the fence behind which they were walking, was a dense mass of  angry people muttering curses on the queen and the Dauphin.    All at once, the mother's heart almost stopped beating from fright and  horror. A man had extended his bare, powerful arm through the paling of  the fence, to bar the Dauphin's way when he should try to pass it.    The boy saw the arm, hesitated a little, then went bravely forward. The  queen hurried that she might be near him when he reached the danger  point. On walked the Dauphin in proud courage. On hurried the queen and  as she reached him, she cried:    \"Come here, my son. Give me your hand.\"    But instead of responding to"]]]
