The _criminality_ of our times, as a matter of fact, has been compared  to a form of _barbarism_ surviving in the midst of civilized peoples.  It is, therefore, through the better organization of work that society  will probably attain to a further purification, and in the meanwhile  it seems unconsciously to be seeking the overthrow of the last  barriers between itself and liberty.    If this is what we learn from society, how great should be the results  among little children from three to six years of age if the  organization of their work is complete, and their freedom absolute? It  is for this reason that to us they seem so good, like heralds of hope  and of redemption.    If men, walking as yet so painfully and imperfectly along the road of  work and of freedom, have become better, why should we fear that the  same road will prove disastrous to the children?    Yet, on the other hand, I would not say that the goodness of our  little ones in their freedom will solve the problem of the absolute  goodness or wickedness of man. We can only say that we have made a  contribution to the cause of goodness by removing obstacles which were  the cause of violence and of rebellion.    Let us \"render, therefore, unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and  unto God the things that are God's.\"          THE END          Transcriber's Note:      Illustrations have been moved closer to their relevant paragraphs.

II      [3] ROMAN VERMOUTH    _ABSINTHIUM ROMANUM_ [1]    ROMAN VERMOUTH [or Absinth] IS MADE THUS: ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE OF  CAMERINUM [2] YOU NEED WORMWOOD FROM SANTO [3] FOR ROMAN VERMOUTH OR,  AS A SUBSTITUTE, WORMWOOD FROM THE PONTUS [4] CLEANED AND CRUSHED, 1  THEBAN OUNCE [5] OF IT, 6 SCRUPLES OF MASTICH, 3 EACH OF [nard]  LEAVES, COSTMARY [6] AND SAFFRON AND 18 QUARTS OF ANY KIND OF MILD  WINE. [Filter cold] CHARCOAL IS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE  BITTERNESS.        [1] G.-V. _Apsinthium_.        [2] The mention of a name in a recipe is very      infrequent. Camerinum is a town in Umbria.        [3] Now Saintonge, Southern France.        [4] Black Sea Region.        [5] Weight of indefinite volume, from Thebae, one of the      several ancient cities by that name. List. thinks it is      an Egyptian ounce, and that the author of the recipe      must be an African.        [6] Wanting in Tor.; G.-V. _costi scripulos senos_.        III      [4] ROSE WINE [1]    _ROSATUM_    MAKE ROSE WINE IN THIS MANNER: ROSE PETALS, THE LOWER WHITE PART  REMOVED, SEWED INTO A LINEN BAG AND IMMERSED IN WINE FOR SEVEN DAYS.  THEREUPON ADD A SACK OF NEW PETALS WHICH ALLOW TO DRAW FOR ANOTHER  SEVEN DAYS. AGAIN REMOVE THE OLD PETALS AND REPLACE THEM BY FRESH ONES  FOR ANOTHER WEEK; THEN STRAIN THE WINE THROUGH THE COLANDER. BEFORE  SERVING, ADD HONEY SWEETENING TO TASTE. TAKE CARE THAT ONLY THE BEST  PETALS FREE FROM DEW BE USED FOR SOAKING.        [1] Used principally as a laxative medicine. List. These      wines compounded of roses and violets move the bowels      strongly.      [5] VIOLET WINE    _VIOLATIUM_    IN A SIMILAR WAY AS ABOVE LIKE THE ROSE WINE VIOLET WINE IS MADE OF  FRESH VIOLETS, AND TEMPERED WITH HONEY, AS DIRECTED.      [6] ROSE WINE WITHOUT [1] ROSES    _ROSATUM SINE ROSA_    ROSE WINE WITHOUT ROSES IS MADE IN THIS FASHION: A PALM LEAF BASKET  FULL OF FRESH CITRUS LEAVES IS IMMERSED IN THE VAT OF NEW WINE BEFORE  FERMENTATION HAS SET IN. AFTER FORTY DAYS RETIRE THE LEAVES, AND, AS  OCCASION ARISES, SWEETEN THE WINE WITH HONEY, AND PASS IT UP FOR ROSE  WINE.        [1] A substitute.        IV      [7] LIBURNIAN OIL    _OLEUM LIBURNICUM_    IN ORDER TO MAKE AN OIL SIMILAR TO THE LIBURNIAN OIL PROCEED AS  FOLLOWS: IN SPANISH OIL PUT [the following mixture of] ELECAMPANE,  CYPRIAN RUSH AND GREEN LAUREL LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TOO OLD, ALL OF IT  CRUSHED AND MACERATED AND REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER. SIFT THIS IN AND  ADD FINELY GROUND SALT AND STIR INDUSTRIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE.  THEN ALLOW TO SETTLE. EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THIS FOR LIBURNIAN OIL. [1]        [1] Like the above a flagrant case of food adulteration.        V      [8] TO CLARIFY MUDDY WINE    _VINUM EX ATRO CANDIDUM FACIES_    PUT BEAN MEAL AND THE WHITES OF THREE EGGS IN A MIXING BOWL. MIX  THOROUGHLY WITH A WHIP AND ADD TO THE WINE, STIRRING FOR A LONG TIME.  THE NEXT DAY THE WINE WILL BE CLEAR [1]. ASHES OF VINES HAVE THE SAME  EFFECT.        [1] Ex Lister whose version we prefer. He says, _Alias      die erit candidum_ while Tor. adds white salt, saying,      _sal si adieceris candidum_, same as Tac. This is      unusual, although the ancients have at times treated      wine with sea water.        VI      [9] TO IMPROVE A BROTH [1]    _DE LIQUAMINE EMENDANDO_ [2]    IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND  FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT,  POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND  IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO  IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE  [6].        [1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.        [2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.        [3] Dann. Ventilate it. Goll. Whip the sauce in fresh      air.        [4] List., G.-V. _si salsum fuerit_--if this makes it      too salty--Tor. _si hoc nihil effecerit_.        [5] Tor. _novem spicam immittas_; List. _Move spica_;      Goll.-Dann. stir with a whip.        [6] A classic example of Apician confusion when one      interpreter reads \"s\" for \"f\" and \"_novem_\" for \"_move_\"      and another reads something else. Tor. is more correct      than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption.      Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be      discarded.        VII      [10] TO KEEP MEATS FRESH WITHOUT SALT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME     _UT CARNES SINE SALE QUOVIS TEMPORE RECENTES SINT_    COVER FRESH MEAT WITH HONEY, SUSPEND IT IN A VESSEL. USE AS NEEDED; IN  WINTER IT WILL KEEP BUT IN SUMMER IT WILL LAST ONLY A FEW DAYS. COOKED  MEAT MAY BE TREATED LIKEWISE.      [11] TO KEEP COOKED SIDES OF PORK OR BEEF OR TENDERLOINS     _CALLUM PORCINUM VEL BUBULUM ET UNGUELLAE COCTAE UT DIU DURENT_    PLACE THEM IN A PICKLE OF MUSTARD, VINEGAR, SALT AND HONEY, COVERING  MEAT ENTIRELY, AND WHEN READY TO USE YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.        V. Method still popular today for pickling raw meats.      The originals treat of cooked meats (Tor. _nucula      elixa_; G.-V. _unguellae coctae_; Tac. _nucella cocta_).      Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole      pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root      vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added      to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and      the Germans _Sauerbraten-Einlage_.        VIII      [12] TO MAKE SALT MEAT SWEET     _UT CARNEM SALSAM DULCEM FACIAS_    YOU CAN MAKE SALT MEATS SWEET BY FIRST BOILING THEM IN MILK AND THEN  FINISHING THEM IN WATER.        V. Method still in practice today. Salt mackerel, finnan      haddie, etc., are parboiled in milk prior to being      boiled in water or broiled or fried.        IX      [13] TO KEEP FRIED FISH     _UT PISCES FRICTI DIU DURENT_    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE FRIED POUR HOT VINEGAR OVER THEM.        Dann. Exactly as we today with fried herring and river      lamprey.      [14] TO KEEP OYSTERS     _OSTREA UT DIU DURENT_    FUMIGATE A VINEGAR BARREL WITH PITCH [1], WASH IT OUT WITH VINEGAR AND  STACK THE OYSTERS IN IT [2]        [1] Tor. _vas ascernum_, corrected on margin, _ab      aceto_. List. _vas ab aceto_, which is correct. G.-V.      _lavas ab aceto_; V. the oysters? unthinkable! Besides      it would do no good.        [2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in      vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt,      close tight. V. Goll's authority for this version is      not found in our originals.        V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in      their natural habitat--salt water. Today we pack them in      barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them--of      no avail. The only way English oysters could have      arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially      constructed bottoms of the galleys.        X      [15] MAKING A LITTLE LASER GO A LONG WAY     _UT NUCIA _[1]_ LASERIS TOTO TEMPORE UTARIS_    PUT THE LASER [2] IN A SPACIOUS GLASS VESSEL; IMMERSE ABOUT 20 PINE  KERNELS [pignolia nuts]    IF YOU NEED LASER FLAVOR, TAKE SOME NUTS, CRUSH THEM; THEY WILL IMPART  TO YOUR DISH AN ADMIRABLE FLAVOR. REPLACE THE USED NUTS WITH A LIKE  NUMBER OF FRESH ONES [3]        [1] List. and G.-V. _uncia_--ounce. Making an ounce of      laser go a long way. Tor. _nucea_; Tac. _nucia_. Lister,      fond of hair-splitting, is irreconcilably opposed to      Tor., and berates Caspar Barthius for defending Tor.      List. _Quam futilis sit in multis labor C. Barthii ut      menda Torini passim sustineat, vel ex hoc loco      intelligere licet: Et enim lege modo uncia pro nucea cum      Humelbergio, & ista omnia glossemata vana sunt._        V. both readings, _uncia_ or _nucia_ are permissible,      and make very little difference. We side with Tor. and      Tac. because it takes more than an ounce of laser to      carry out this experiment.        [2] _Laser_, _laserpitium_, cf. dictionary.        [3] V. This article illustrates how sparingly the      ancients used the strong and pungent laser flavor [by      some believed to be _asa foetida_] because it was very      expensive, but principally because the Roman cooks      worked economically and knew how to treat spices and      flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse      for all time all stories of ancient Rome's extravagance      in flavoring and seasoning dishes. It reminds of the      methods used by European cooks to get the utmost use out      of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a      can of powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only      which has soon acquired a delicate vanilla perfume, and      will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is      by far a superior method to using the often rank and      adulterated \"vanilla extract\" readily bottled. It is      more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial      extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that      any of them impart to the dishes the true flavor desired      is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption of      such extracts however, is characteristic of our      industrialized barbarism which is so utterly indifferent      to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for      the public to obtain a real vanilla bean.        Cf. also notes regarding flavoring to Nos. 276-7, 345      and 385.        XI      [16] TO MAKE HONEY CAKES LAST     _UT DULCIA DE MELLE DIU DURENT_    TO MAKE HONEY CAKES THAT WILL KEEP TAKE WHAT THE GREEKS CALL YEAST [1]  AND MIX IT WITH THE FLOUR AND THE HONEY AT THE TIME WHEN MAKING THE  COOKY DOUGH.        [1] Tor. and Tac. _nechon_; G.-V. _cnecon_; Dann.      _penion_.      [17] SPOILED HONEY MADE GOOD     _UT MEL MALUM BONUM FACIAS_    HOW BAD HONEY MAY BE TURNED INTO A SALEABLE ARTICLE IS TO MIX ONE PART  OF THE SPOILED HONEY WITH TWO PARTS OF GOOD HONEY.        List. _indigna fraus_! V. We all agree with Lister that      this is contemptible business. This casts another light"]]]
