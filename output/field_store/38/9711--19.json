[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#16)"],[1,"life.\"    Rev. A. G. Bulfinch (brother of the author).    Morris tells the story of Pygmalion and the Image in some of the  most beautiful verses of the Earthly Paradise.    This is Galatea's description of her metamorphosis:      \"'My sweet,' she said, 'as yet I am not wise,    Or stored with words aright the tale to tell,    But listen: when I opened first mine eyes    I stood within the niche thou knowest well,    And from my hand a heavy thing there fell    Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear,    But with a strange confused noise could hear.      \"'At last mine eyes could see a woman fair,    But awful as this round white moon o'erhead,    So that I trembled when I saw her there,    For with my life was born some touch of dread,    And therewithal I heard her voice that said,    \"Come down and learn to love and be alive,    For thee, a well-prized gift, today I give.\"'\"        DRYOPE    Dryope and Iole were sisters.  The former was the wife of  Andraemon, beloved by her husband, and happy in the birth of her  first child.  One day the sisters strolled to the bank of a  stream that sloped gradually down to the water's edge, while the  upland was overgrown with myrtles.  They were intending to gather  flowers for forming garlands for the altars of the nymphs, and  Dryope carried her child at her bosom, a precious burden, and  nursed him as she walked.  Near the water grew a lotus plant,  full of purple flowers.  Dryope gathered some and offered them to  the baby, and Iole was about to do the same, when she perceived  blood dropping from the places where her sister had broken them  off the stem.  The plant was no other than the Nymph Lotis, who,  running from a base pursuer, had been changed into this form.  This they learned from the country people when it was too late.    Dryope, horror-struck when she perceived what she had done, would  gladly have hastened from the spot, but found her feet rooted to  the ground.  She tried to pull them away, but moved nothing but  her arms.  The woodiness crept upward, and by degrees invested  her body.  In anguish she attempted to tear her hair, but found  her hands filled with leaves.  The infant felt his mother's bosom  begin to harden, and the milk cease to flow.  Iole looked on at  the sad fate of her sister, and could render no assistance.  She  embraced the growing trunk, as if she would hold back the  advancing wood, and would gladly have been enveloped in the same  bark.  At this moment Andraemon, the husband of Dryope, with her  father, approached; and when they asked for Dryope, Iole pointed  them to the new-formed lotus.  They embraced the trunk of the yet  warm tree, and showered their kisses on its leaves.    Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her face.  Her tears  still flowed and fell on her leaves, and while she could she  spoke.  \"I am not guilty.  I deserve not this fate.  I have  injured no one.  If I speak falsely, may my foliage perish with  drought and my trunk be cut down and burned.  Take this infant  and give him to a nurse.  Let him often be brought and nursed  under my branches, and play in my shade; and when he is old  enough to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and to say  with sadness, 'My mother lies hid under this bark' But bid him be  careful of river banks, and beware how he plucks flowers,  remembering that every bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise.  Farewell, dear husband, and sister, and father.  If you retain  any love for me, let not the axe wound me, nor the flocks bite  and tear my branches.  Since I cannot stoop to you, climb up  hither and kiss me; and while my lips continue to feel, lift up  my child that I may kiss him.  I can speak no more, for already  the bark advances up my neck, and will soon shoot over me.  You  need not close my eyes; the bark will close them without your  aid.\"  Then the lips ceased to move, and life was extinct; but  the branches retained, for some time longer the vital heat.    Keats, in Endymion, alludes to Dryope thus:      \"She took a lute from which there pulsing came    A lively prelude, fashioning the way    In which her voice should wander.  'Twas a lay    More subtle-cadenced, more forest-wild    Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child.\"      VENUS AND ADONIS    Venus, playing one day with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with  one of his arrows.  She pushed him away, but the wound was deeper  than she thought.  Before it healed she beheld Adonis, and was  captivated with him.  She no longer took any interest in her  favorite resorts,   Paphos, and Cnidos, and Amathos, rich in  metals.  She absented herself even from Olympus, for Adonis was  dearer to her than heaven.  Him she followed and bore him  company.  She who used to love to recline in the shade, with no  care but to cultivate her charms, now rambled through the woods  and over the hills, dressed like the huntress Diana.  She called  her dogs, and chased hares and stags, or other game that it is  safe to hunt, but kept clear of the wolves and bears, reeking  with the slaughter of the herd.  She charged Adonis, too, to  beware of such dangerous animals.  \"Be brave towards the timid,\"  said she; \"courage against the courageous is not safe.  Beware  how you expose yourself to danger, and put my happiness to risk.  Attack not the beasts that Nature has armed with weapons.  I do  not value your glory so highly as to consent to purchase it by  such exposure.  Your youth, and the beauty that charms Venus,  will not touch the hearts of lions and bristly boars.  Think of  their terrible claws and prodigious strength!  I hate the whole  race of them.  Do you ask why?\"  Then she told him the story of  Atalanta and Hippomenes, who were changed into lions for their  ingratitude to her.    Having given him this warning, she mounted her chariot drawn by  swans, and drove away through the air.  But Adonis was too noble  to heed such counsels.  The dogs had roused a wild boar from his  lair, and the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with a  sidelong stroke.  The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws,  and rushed after Adonis, who turned and ran; but the boar  overtook him, and buried his tusks in his side, and stretched him  dying upon the plain.    Venus, in her swan-drawn chariot, had not yet reached Cyprus,  when she heard coming up through mid air the groans of her  beloved, and turned her white-winged coursers back to earth.  As  she drew near and saw from on high his lifeless body bathed in  blood, she alighted, and bending over it beat her breast and tore  her hair.  Reproaching the Fates, she said, \"Yet theirs shall be  but a partial triumph; memorials of my grief shall endure, and  the spectacle of your death, my Adonis, and of my lamentation  shall be annually renewed.  Your blood shall be changed into a  flower; that consolation none can envy me.\"  Thus speaking, she  sprinkled nectar on the blood; and as they mingled, bubbles rose  as in a pool on which raindrops fall, and in an hour's time there  sprang up a flower of bloody hue like that of a pomegranate.  But  it is short-lived.  It is said the wind blows the blossoms open,  and afterwards blows the petals away; so it is called Anemone, or  wind Flower, from the cause which assists equally in its  production and its decay.    Milton alludes to the story of Venus and Adonis in his Comus:      \"Beds of hyacinth and roses    Where young Adonis oft reposes,    Waxing well of his deep wound    In slumber soft, and on the ground    Sadly sits th'Assyrian queen.\"    And Morris also in Atalanta's Race:      \"There by his horn the Dryads well might know    His thrust against the bear's heart had been true,    And there Adonis bane his javelin slew\"      APOLLO AND HYACINTHUS    Apollo was passionately fond of a youth named Hyacinthus.  He  accompanied him in his sports, carried the nets when he went  fishing, led the dogs when he went to hunt, followed him in his  excursions in the mountains, and neglected for him his lyre and  his arrows.  One day they played a game of quoits together, and  Apollo, heaving aloft the discus, with strength mingled with  skill, sent it high and far.  Hyacinthus watched it as it flew,  and excited with the sport ran forward to seize it, eager to make  his throw, when the quoit bounded from the earth and struck him  in the forehead.  He fainted and fell.  The god, as pale as  himself, raised him and tried all his art to stanch the wound and  retain the flitting life, but all in vain; the hurt was past the  power of medicine.  As, when one has broken the stem of a lily in  the garden, it hangs its head and turns its flowers to the earth,  so the head of the dying boy, as if too heavy for his neck, fell  over on his shoulder.  \"Thou diest, Hyacinth,\" so spoke Phoebus,  \"robbed of thy youth by me.  Thine is the suffering, mine the  crime.  Would that I could die for thee!  But since that may not  be thou shalt live with me in memory and in song.  My lyre shall  celebrate thee, my song shall tell thy fate, and thou shalt  become a flower inscribed with my regrets.\"  While Apollo spoke,  behold the blood which had flowed on the ground and stained the  herbage, ceased to be blood; but a flower of hue more beautiful  than the Tyrian sprang up, resembling the lily, if it were not  that this is purple and that silvery white (it is evidently not  our modern hyacinth that is here described.  It is perhaps some  species of iris, or perhaps of larkspur, or of pansy.)  And this  was not enough for Phoebus; but to confer still grater honor, he  marked the petals with his sorrow, and inscribed \"Ah!  Ah!\" upon  them, as we see to this day.  The flower bears the name of  Hyacinthus, and with every returning spring revives the memory of  his fate.    It was said that Zephyrus (the West-wind), who was also fond of  Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the  quoit out of its course to make it strike"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#16)"],[1,"insect at rest.\"    \"So they do to me,\" answered Bee. \"That is the reason I chose them for  the flowers.\" She had filled a vase with the blossoms upon which two  large artificial butterflies rested, apparently partaking of the sweets  of the flowers.    \"'The Sulphurs,'\" read a second, picking up the menu card which Bee had  carefully written for each plate. \"Gentlemen, I am afraid that we are  in for it.\"    \"Miss Raymond intends for us to eat our own words--no; that is not  exactly what I mean, although some of us have written upon the subject  of Lepidoptera,\" said the third one, a small man in spectacles.    Beatrice could not repress a little laugh at the look of relief that  flashed across each man's face as Tillie, the \"likely gal\" of whom Aunt  Fanny had spoken, appeared with \"The Sulphurs\" which proved to be yellow  cantaloupes, ice cold.    \"After all you are not the first martyrs to science,\" she told them  merrily. \"Luther had to partake of a diet of worms, I believe.\"    \"So he did,\" observed the scientist on her right. \"Let me see. How does  the rhyme go?        \"'Instead of butter on his bread      A sauce of butterflies was spread.'    \"Are we to have that next? I see what is in store for us. 'All life is  from an egg,'\" reading aloud from the menu. \"That sounds interesting.\"    With an eagerness that was almost boyish they awaited Tillie's coming  with the next course which developed into egg soup accompanied by hot  wafers. A laugh of pure enjoyment went up as Scale insects with  chrysalids and some green hair streaks was seen to be baked fish with  shrimp salad, dressed with cucumbers.    An entree--\"Scarce clouded yellows,\" mushrooms on toast--was provocative  of so much merriment that Bee gave herself up to the fun, assured that  the dinner was a success. Stiffness could not exist under such  conditions, and the grave scientists unbent from their dignity, and  jested and made merry like a lot of school-boys. There was admiration in  the look that Doctor Raymond bestowed upon his daughter as course  followed course, each bearing the name of a certain species of  butterfly, evolved from a resemblance of color or form to the viands.  The dessert, \"The Arctics with Boisduval Marble,\" was ice cream frozen  in butterfly moulds and marble cake; while \"Wooded Nymphs\" were salted  almonds.    \"Gentlemen,\" said one, rising as the last course--'The Mourning Cloak'  which meant black coffee--was served, \"let us toast our hostess. This  has been one of the most ingenious as well as one of the most enjoyable  dinners I ever attended. It has the merit of originality, and puts to  blush the efforts of older but not wiser ladies. Doctor Raymond, I  congratulate you upon your daughter. You should be proud of her, sir.\"    Doctor Raymond bowed his acknowledgments, while Bee sat, so proud and  happy that she was almost overcome.    \"I confess that I was a little dubious when I first saw that menu card,\"  confessed her father with a smile as he finished his coffee.    \"Do you mean that you did not aid her? That she did in truth plan this  alone?\" exclaimed the shy gentleman in surprise. \"Where then did she get  her knowledge of the subject?\"    \"Beatrice studied it while I was away,\" explained Doctor Raymond. \"It  was done in order to help me in my work, I believe; and she has  certainly proved to be a very enthusiastic assistant. She is helping me  in my cataloguing this summer. Shall we go to the piazza, gentlemen?  There is just time for a cigar before your train.\"    They passed from the dining room, leaving Bee flushed and happy to  report their success to Aunt Fanny. Presently Joel came with the  carriage and the Lepidopterists took their departure. Doctor Raymond  laid his hand lightly upon his daughter's arm, and turned her toward  him.    \"Was that entirely your own idea about the dinner?\" he asked.    \"Yes, father. Did you like it?\"    \"Very much indeed. It was admirably conceived, and most admirably  executed. Did you have no assistance beside Aunt Fanny?\"    \"Only Tillie,\" responded Bee. \"Aunt Fanny didn't want any 'udder worman  traipesing erbout her kitchen.'\" Bee laughed a little at the remembrance  of the negress' indignation. \"She said that she could cook for men even  though they were 'satanic;' so I did the planning, and she did the  cooking. You must praise her too, father. I never could have done it  without her.\"    \"I am glad to hear you say that, Beatrice. I was afraid that you might  take all the credit to yourself, but I see that you are willing to share  honors.\"    Beatrice drew closer to him. There were times when she would have dearly  loved to have thrown her arms about his neck as she had seen Adele do  with her father, but Doctor Raymond was not a demonstrative man, and she  stood too much in awe of him to take the initiative. Just at the present  she felt closer to him than she had done since his return. He was proud  of her and showed it plainly. He was coming to care for her, even though  she was not pretty. He had been right. Beauty did not matter after all.  Oh, she would be so good, so good, and study so hard that he could not  help but love her. She was so happy. His hand still lay on her arm as if  he liked it to be there. A mist came into her eyes, and a lump into her  throat that caused her to breathe quickly.    \"Beatrice!\"    \"Yes, father?\"    \"Did you know that your Uncle Henry was very ill?\"    \"No; I am sorry to hear it. Are they at home?\"    \"Yes; they returned from Annie's mother's just as soon as Henry began to  feel bad. He must have the utmost quiet. Even I am not allowed to see  him. And, Beatrice--\"    \"Yes, father?\" spoke Bee again.    \"Adele must go away while he is so ill.\" Doctor Raymond spoke with some  hesitation. \"Her mother wished her to stay with her grandmother, but she  is very unhappy at her separation from you, and she wishes to come here.  I wished to bring her with me today, but Annie insisted that you should  be consulted upon the matter first. You can have no objection, surely.\"    \"Father!\" Anguish and appeal were in Bee's voice. She turned from him  and covered her face with her hands.    \"My daughter, are you still harboring resentment against your cousin on  account of my mistake? That would be unworthy of you.\"    \"Don't,\" cried Bee, brokenly. \"Don't, father!\"    There was surprise and grave displeasure in Doctor Raymond's face. That  he was more than pained was evident. His daughter had never seemed so  womanly as she had that day, and now--he was perplexed. The man was more  acquainted with the ways of insects than he was with girls, and had Bee  been a butterfly rather than a most miserable girl he would have known  just what to do. As it was he stood in what seemed to Beatrice cold  disapproval.    \"He wants her to come,\" she thought with a pang of bitterness. \"And I  was so happy only a moment ago. Oh, if I could only have him to myself a  little longer, I wouldn't care. I know that I could win him to like me  best if I only had a little longer. She will spoil everything.\" She gave  a little sob.    Dr. Raymond gave an impatient movement.    \"Beatrice,\" he said, \"I confess that I do not see why this should cause  you so much grief. It distresses me very much. You should remember that  you shared your cousin's home for many years. It is ungracious to  hesitate for a moment.\"    \"They were well paid for their care of me,\" flashed Beatrice with  passionate anger. \"And they never allowed me to come between them and  Adele. Aunt Annie said that it was natural and right that Adele should  be first in her own home, and I agreed with her. I gave up in everything  to her when I was there. Now, I want to be first in my home. It is not  right for her to come here when I haven't had you for so long. Adele  only cares to come because you admire her. It isn't at all because she  cares for me. And she ought not to leave her father! Oh! it isn't--it  isn't--\" She burst into tears, unable to finish.    There followed a long silence eloquent with the grief of the daughter,  and the unspoken censure of the father. Beatrice felt his disapproval,  and she could not bear it. At length, feeling that even Adele's presence  could be borne better than his displeasure, she lifted her tear-stained  face, and said in a trembling voice:    \"Bring her when you wish, father, but, but--\" She could say no more.    \"That is my own daughter,\" he exclaimed approvingly. \"That was a real  victory over unworthy feelings, Beatrice. And there is no cause for any  jealousy toward your cousin. Remember that, and conquer whatever of ill  feeling toward her may lurk in your breast.\"    \"Yes, father,\" said Bee, trying not to sob.    \"I can not bear it,\" she told herself as she went finally to her room.  \"He wants her to come. He loves her best after all. And I meant to be so  good, so good! But it's no use. No use!\"    And so what had been a happy day closed with unpleasantness and she went  to bed feeling that all her good times with her father were ended.          Chapter XIV    A Little Sermon        \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all      Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"        --_Keats._      \"I shall go to Henry's today, Beatrice,\" Doctor Raymond informed his  daughter the next morning. \"Adele will return with me.\"    \"Very well, father,\" acquiesced Beatrice apathetically. She was pale,  with deep circles under her eyes, and looked as though she had not  slept.    \"I am afraid that you worked too hard on that dinner,\" commented the  naturalist with solicitude. \"Do you not feel well?\"    \"I am quite well, thank you, father,\" returned the girl gravely.    \"I shall be glad when your cousin comes,\" remarked he. \"I fear that I  have kept you too close to study this summer.\"    \"No, no,\" denied Bee. \"I am just tired, that is all.\"    What difference did it make to him whether she had worked too hard or  not, she asked herself with all the injustice of "]]]
