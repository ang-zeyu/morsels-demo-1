(#16)"],[1,"years I  may perhaps have fostered too earnestly, and which as I grew older I tried  my utmost to combat, did not seem becoming in the man, and I therefore had  to strive to attain to more complete freedom.\" Conclusion?--I have had to  do the same.        8.      He who wakes us always wounds us.        9.      I do not possess the talent of being loyal, and what is still worse, I  have not even the vanity to try to appear as if I did.        10.      He who accomplishes anything that lies beyond the vision and the  experience of his acquaintances,--provokes envy and hatred masked as  pity,--prejudice regards the work as decadence, disease, seduction. Long  faces.        11.      I frankly confess that I had hoped that by means of art the Germans would  become thoroughly disgusted with _decaying Christianity_--I regarded German  mythology as a solvent, as a means of accustoming people to polytheism.    What a fright I had over the Catholic revival!!        12.      It is possible neither to suffer sufficiently acutely from life, nor to be  so lifeless and emotionally weak, as to have _need_ of Wagner's art, as to  require it as a medium. This is the principal reason of one's _opposition_  to it, and not baser motives; something to which we are not driven by any  personal need, and which we do not _require_, we cannot esteem so highly.        13.      It is a question either of no longer _requiring_ Wagner's art, or of still  requiring it.    Gigantic forces lie concealed in it: _it drives one beyond its own  domain_.        14.      _Goethe_ said: \"Are not Byron's audacity, sprightliness and grandeur all  creative? We must beware of always looking for this quality in that which  is perfectly pure and moral. All _greatness_ is creative the moment we  realise it.\" This should be applied to Wagner's art.        15.      We shall always have to credit Wagner with the fact that in the second  half of the nineteenth century he impressed art upon our memory as an  important and magnificent thing. True, he did this in his own fashion, and  this was not the fashion of upright and far-seeing men.        16.      Wagner _versus_ the cautious, the cold and the contented of the world--in  this lies his greatness--he is a stranger to his age--he combats the  frivolous and the super-smart--But he also fights the just, the moderate,  those who delight in the world (like Goethe), and the mild, the people of  charm, the scientific among men--this is the reverse of the medal.        17.      Our youth was up in arms against the _soberness_ of the age. It plunged  into the cult of excess, of passion, of ecstasy, and of the blackest and  most austere conception of the world.        18.      Wagner pursues one form of madness, the age another form. Both carry on  their chase at the same speed, each is as blind and as unjust as the  other.        19.      It is very difficult to trace the course of Wagner's inner development--no  trust must be placed in his own description of his soul's experiences. He  writes party-pamphlets for his followers.        20.      It is extremely doubtful whether Wagner is able to bear witness about  himself.        21.      There are men who try in vain to make a principle out of _themselves_.  This was the case with Wagner.        22.      Wagner's obscurity concerning final aims; his non-antique fogginess.        23.      All Wagner's ideas straightway become manias; he is _tyrannised_ over by  them. How can _such a man allow himself to be tyrannised over in this __  way_! For instance by his hatred of Jews. He _kills_ his themes like his  \"ideas,\" by means of his violent love of repeating them. The problem of  excessive length and breadth; he bores us with his raptures.        24.      \"_C'est la rage de voulour penser et sentir au dela de sa force_\"  (Doudan). The Wagnerites.        25.      Wagner whose ambition far exceeds his natural gifts, has tried an  incalculable number of times to achieve what lay beyond his powers--but it  almost makes one shudder to see some one assail with such persistence that  which defies conquest--the fate of his constitution.        26.      He is always thinking of the most _extreme_ expression,--in every word. But  in the end superlatives begin to pall.        27.      There is something which is in the highest degree suspicious in Wagner,  and that is Wagner's suspicion. It is such a strong trait in him, that on  two occasions I doubted whether he were a musician at all.        28.      The proposition: \"in the face of perfection there is no salvation save  love,\"(16) is thoroughly Wagnerian. Profound jealousy of everything great  from which he can draw _fresh_ ideas. Hatred of all that which he cannot  approach, the Renaissance, French and Greek art in style.        29.      Wagner is jealous of all periods that have shown _restraint_: he despises  beauty and grace, and finds only his own _virtues_ in the \"Germans,\" and  even attributes all his failings to them.        30.      Wagner has not the power to unlock and liberate the soul of those he  frequents. Wagner is not sure of himself, but distrustful and arrogant.  His _art_ has this effect upon artists, it is envious of all rivals.        31.      _Plato's Envy._ He would fain monopolise Socrates. He saturates the latter  with himself, pretends to adorn him ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}), and tries to  separate all Socratists from him in order himself to appear as the only  true apostle. But his historical presentation of him is false, even to a  parlous degree: just as Wagner's presentation of Beethoven and Shakespeare  is false.        32.      When a dramatist speaks about himself he plays a part: this is inevitable.  When Wagner speaks about Bach and Beethoven he speaks like one for whom he  would fain be taken. But he impresses only those who are already  convinced, for his dissimulation and his genuine nature are far too  violently at variance.        33.      Wagner struggles against the \"frivolity\" in his nature, which to him the  ignoble (as opposed to Goethe) constituted the joy of life.        34.      Wagner has the mind of the ordinary man who prefers to trace things to  _one_ cause. The Jews do the same: one _aim_, therefore one Saviour. In  this way he simplifies German and culture; wrongly but strongly.        35.      Wagner admitted all this to himself often enough when in private communion  with his soul. I only wish he had also admitted it publicly. For what  constitutes the greatness of a character if it is not this, that he who  possesses it is able to take sides even against himself in favour of  truth.          _Wagner's Teutonism._        36.      That which is un-German in Wagner. He lacks the German charm and grace of  a Beethoven, a Mozart, a Weber; he also lacks the flowing, cheerful fire  (_Allegro con brio_) of Beethoven and Weber. He cannot be free and easy  without being grotesque. He lacks modesty, indulges in big drums, and  always tends to surcharge his effect. He is not the good official that  Bach was. Neither has he that Goethean calm in regard to his rivals.        37.      Wagner always reaches the high-water mark of his vanity when he speaks of  the German nature (incidentally it is also the height of his imprudence);  for, if Frederick the Great's justice, Goethe's nobility and freedom from  envy, Beethoven's sublime resignation, Bach's delicately transfigured  spiritual life,--if steady work performed without any thought of glory and  success, and without envy, constitute the true _German_ qualities, would  it not seem as if Wagner almost wished to prove he is no German?        38.      Terrible wildness, abject sorrow, emptiness, the shudder of joy,  unexpectedness,--in short all the qualities peculiar to the Semitic race! I  believe that the Jews approach Wagner's art with more understanding than  the Aryans do.        39.      A passage concerning the Jews, taken from Taine.--As it happens, I have  misled the reader, the passage does not concern Wagner at all.--But can it  be possible that Wagner is a Jew? In that case we could readily understand  his dislike of Jews.(17)        40.      Wagner's art is absolutely the _art of the age_: an aesthetic age would  have rejected it. The more subtle people amongst us actually do reject it  even now. The _coarsifying_ of everything aesthetic.--Compared with Goethe's  ideal it is very far behind. The moral contrast of these self-indulgent  burningly loyal creatures of Wagner, acts like a _spur_, like an irritant  and even this sensation is turned to account in obtaining an _effect_.        41.      What is it in our age that Wagner's art expresses? That brutality and most  delicate weakness which exist side by side, that running wild of natural  instincts, and nervous hyper-sensitiveness, that thirst for emotion which  arises from fatigue and the love of fatigue.--All this is understood by the  Wagnerites.        42.      _Stupefaction or intoxication_ constitute all Wagnerian art. On the other  hand I could mention instances in which Wagner stands _higher_, in which  real joy flows from him.        43.      The reason why the figures in Wagner's art behave so madly, is because he  greatly feared lest people would doubt that they were alive.        44.      Wagner's art is an appeal to inartistic people; all means are welcomed  which help towards obtaining an effect. It is calculated not to produce an  _artistic effect_ but an effect upon the _nerves in general_.        45.      Apparently in Wagner we have an art _for everybody_, because coarse and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#16)"],[1,"about him; he  heard the hum of their talk, as they disputed concerning politics, and  the man next to him, who came from Acton, asked him what he thought of  the Government now. There was a discussion, and a loud and excited one,  just in front, as to whether rhubarb was a fruit or vegetable, and in  his ear he heard Redman, who was a near neighbour, praising the economy  of 'the wife.'    'I don't know how she does it. Look here; what do you think we had  yesterday? Breakfast: fish-cakes, beautifully fried--rich, you know,  lots of herbs, it's a receipt of her aunt's; you should just taste 'em.  Coffee, bread, butter, marmalade, and, of course, all the usual  etceteras. Dinner: roast beef, Yorkshire, potatoes, greens, and  horse-radish sauce, plum tart, cheese. And where will you get a better  dinner than that? Well, I call it wonderful, I really do.'    But in spite of these distractions he fell into a dream as the 'bus  rolled and tossed on its way Citywards, and still he strove to solve the  enigma of his vigil of the night before, and as the shapes of trees and  green lawns and houses passed before his eyes, and as he saw the  procession moving on the pavement, and while the murmur of the streets  sounded in his ears, all was to him strange and unaccustomed, as if he  moved through the avenues of some city in a foreign land. It was,  perhaps, on these mornings, as he rode to his mechanical work, that  vague and floating fancies that must have long haunted his brain began  to shape themselves, and to put on the form of definite conclusions,  from which he could no longer escape, even if he had wished it. Darnell  had received what is called a sound commercial education, and would  therefore have found very great difficulty in putting into articulate  speech any thought that was worth thinking; but he grew certain on these  mornings that the 'common sense' which he had always heard exalted as  man's supremest faculty was, in all probability, the smallest and  least-considered item in the equipment of an ant of average  intelligence. And with this, as an almost necessary corollary, came a  firm belief that the whole fabric of life in which he moved was sunken,  past all thinking, in the grossest absurdity; that he and all his  friends and acquaintances and fellow-workers were interested in matters  in which men were never meant to be interested, were pursuing aims which  they were never meant to pursue, were, indeed, much like fair stones of  an altar serving as a pigsty wall. Life, it seemed to him, was a great  search for--he knew not what; and in the process of the ages one by one  the true marks upon the ways had been shattered, or buried, or the  meaning of the words had been slowly forgotten; one by one the signs had  been turned awry, the true entrances had been thickly overgrown, the  very way itself had been diverted from the heights to the depths, till  at last the race of pilgrims had become hereditary stone-breakers and  ditch-scourers on a track that led to destruction--if it led anywhere at  all. Darnell's heart thrilled with a strange and trembling joy, with a  sense that was all new, when it came to his mind that this great loss  might not be a hopeless one, that perhaps the difficulties were by no  means insuperable. It might be, he considered, that the stone-breaker  had merely to throw down his hammer and set out, and the way would be  plain before him; and a single step would free the delver in rubbish  from the foul slime of the ditch.    It was, of course, with difficulty and slowly that these things became  clear to him. He was an English City clerk, 'flourishing' towards the  end of the nineteenth century, and the rubbish heap that had been  accumulating for some centuries could not be cleared away in an instant.  Again and again the spirit of nonsense that had been implanted in him as  in his fellows assured him that the true world was the visible and  tangible world, the world in which good and faithful letter-copying was  exchangeable for a certain quantum of bread, beef, and house-room, and  that the man who copied letters well, did not beat his wife, nor lose  money foolishly, was a good man, fulfilling the end for which he had  been made. But in spite of these arguments, in spite of their acceptance  by all who were about him, he had the grace to perceive the utter  falsity and absurdity of the whole position. He was fortunate in his  entire ignorance of sixpenny 'science,' but if the whole library had  been projected into his brain it would not have moved him to 'deny in  the darkness that which he had known in the light.' Darnell knew by  experience that man is made a mystery for mysteries and visions, for the  realization in his consciousness of ineffable bliss, for a great joy  that transmutes the whole world, for a joy that surpasses all joys and  overcomes all sorrows. He knew this certainly, though he knew it dimly;  and he was apart from other men, preparing himself for a great  experiment.    With such thoughts as these for his secret and concealed treasure, he  was able to bear the threatened invasion of Mrs. Nixon with something  approaching indifference. He knew, indeed, that her presence between  his wife and himself would be unwelcome to him, and he was not without  grave doubts as to the woman's sanity; but after all, what did it  matter? Besides, already a faint glimmering light had risen within him  that showed the profit of self-negation, and in this matter he had  preferred his wife's will to his own. _Et non sua poma_; to his  astonishment he found a delight in denying himself his own wish, a  process that he had always regarded as thoroughly detestable. This was a  state of things which he could not in the least understand; but, again,  though a member of a most hopeless class, living in the most hopeless  surroundings that the world has ever seen, though he knew as much of the  _askesis_ as of Chinese metaphysics; again, he had the grace not to deny  the light that had begun to glimmer in his soul.    And he found a present reward in the eyes of Mary, when she welcomed him  home after his foolish labours in the cool of the evening. They sat  together, hand in hand, under the mulberry tree, at the coming of the  dusk, and as the ugly walls about them became obscure and vanished into  the formless world of shadows, they seemed to be freed from the bondage  of Shepherd's Bush, freed to wander in that undisfigured, undefiled  world that lies beyond the walls. Of this region Mary knew little or  nothing by experience, since her relations had always been of one mind  with the modern world, which has for the true country an instinctive and  most significant horror and dread. Mr. Reynolds had also shared in  another odd superstition of these later days--that it is necessary to  leave London at least once a year; consequently Mary had some knowledge  of various seaside resorts on the south and east coasts, where  Londoners gather in hordes, turn the sands into one vast, bad  music-hall, and derive, as they say, enormous benefit from the change.  But experiences such as these give but little knowledge of the country  in its true and occult sense; and yet Mary, as she sat in the dusk  beneath the whispering tree, knew something of the secret of the wood,  of the valley shut in by high hills, where the sound of pouring water  always echoes from the clear brook. And to Darnell these were nights of  great dreams; for it was the hour of the work, the time of  transmutation, and he who could not understand the miracle, who could  scarcely believe in it, yet knew, secretly and half consciously, that  the water was being changed into the wine of a new life. This was ever  the inner music of his dreams, and to it he added on these still and  sacred nights the far-off memory of that time long ago when, a child,  before the world had overwhelmed him, he journeyed down to the old grey  house in the west, and for a whole month heard the murmur of the forest  through his bedroom window, and when the wind was hushed, the washing of  the tides about the reeds; and sometimes awaking very early he had heard  the strange cry of a bird as it rose from its nest among the reeds, and  had looked out and had seen the valley whiten to the dawn, and the  winding river whiten as it swam down to the sea. The memory of all this  had faded and become shadowy as he grew older and the chains of common  life were riveted firmly about his soul; all the atmosphere by which he  was surrounded was well-nigh fatal to such thoughts, and only now and  again in half-conscious moments or in sleep he had revisited that valley  in the far-off west, where the breath of the wind was an incantation,  and every leaf and stream and hill spoke of great and ineffable  mysteries. But now the broken vision was in great part restored to him,  and looking with love in his wife's eyes he saw the gleam of water-pools  in the still forest, saw the mists rising in the evening, and heard the  music of the winding river.    They were sitting thus together on the Friday evening of the week that  had begun with that odd and half-forgotten visit of Mrs. Nixon, when, to  Darnell's annoyance, the door-bell gave a discordant peal, and Alice  with some disturbance of manner came out and announced that a gentleman  wished to see the master. Darnell went into the drawing-room, where  Alice had lit one gas so that it flared and burnt with a rushing sound,  and in this distorting light there waited a stout, elderly gentleman,  whose countenance was altogether unknown to him. He stared blankly, and  hesitated, about to speak, but the visitor began.    'You don't know who I am, but I expect you'll know my name. It's Nixon.'    He did not wait to be interrupted. He sat down and plunged into  narrative, and after the first few words, Darnell, whose mind was not  altogether unprepared, listened without much astonishment.    'And the"]]]
