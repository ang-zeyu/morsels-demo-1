I guess I will go to bed--I will sleep well  to-night--Thursday.    \"I did not hear from the Naval Secretary, Tuesday, so yesterday morning  I went up to the Admiralty and sent in my card. He came out and received  me very well--said I had passed a 'very splendid examination'; had been  recommended very strongly to the Viceroy, who was very much pleased;  that the Director of the Naval College over at the Arsenal had wanted me  and would I go over at once? I _would_. It was about five miles. We (a  friend, who is a great rider here) went on steeplechase ponies--we were  ferried across the Pei Ho in a small scow and then had a long ride.  There _is_ a path--but Pritchard insisted on taking all the ditches,  and as my pony jumped like a cat, it wasn't nice at first, but I didn't  squeal and kept my seat and got the swing of it at last and rather liked  it. I think I will keep a horse here--you can hire one and a servant  together for $7 a month; that is $5.60 of our money, and pony and man  found in everything.    \"Well--at last we got to the Arsenal--a place about four miles around,  fortified, where all sorts of arms--cartridges, shot and shell, engines,  and _everything_--are made. The Naval College is inside surrounded by  a moat and wall. I thought to myself, if the cadet here is like to the  thing I used to be at the U. S. N. A. _that_ won't keep him in. I went  through a lot of yards till I was ushered into a room finished in black  ebony and was greeted very warmly by the Director. We took seats on a  raised platform--Chinese style and pretty soon an interpreter came, one  of the Chinese professors, who was educated abroad, and we talked and  drank tea. He said I had done well, that he had the authority of the  Viceroy to take me there as 'Professor' of seamanship and gunnery; in  addition I might be required to teach navigation or nautical astronomy,  or drill the cadets in infantry, artillery, and fencing. For this I was  to receive what would be in our money $1,800 per annum, as near as we  can compare it, paid in gold each month. Besides, I will have a house  furnished for my use, and it is their intention, as soon as I _show_  that I _know_ something, to considerably increase my pay. They asked  the Viceroy to give me 130 T per month (about $186) and house, but the  Viceroy said I was _but a boy_; that I had seen no years and had only  come here a week ago with no one to vouch for me, and that I might turn  out an impostor. But he would risk 100 T on me anyhow, and as soon as  I was reported favorably on by the college I would be raised--the  agreement is to be for three years. For a few months I am to command  a training ship--an ironclad that is in dry dock at present, until a  captain in the English Navy comes out, who has been sent for to command  her.    \"_So Here I am_--twenty-four years old and captain of a man-of-war--a  better one than any in our own navy--only for a short time, of course,  but I would be a pretty long time before I would command one at home.  Well--I accepted and will enter on my duties in a week, as soon as my  house is put in order. I saw it--it has a long veranda, very broad; with  flower garden, apricot trees, etc., just covered with blossoms; a wide  hall on the front, a room about 18x15, with a 13-foot ceiling; then back  another rather larger, with a cupola skylight in the centre, where I  am going to put a shelf with flowers. The Government is to furnish the  house with bed, tables, chairs, sideboards, lounges, stove for kitchen.  I have grates (American) in the room, but I don't need them. We have  snow, and a good deal of ice in winter, but the thermometer never gets  below zero. I have to supply my own crockery. I will have two servants  and cook; I will only get one and the cook first--they only cost $4  to $5.50 per month, and their board amounts to very little. I can get  along, don't you think so? Now I want you to get Jim to pack up all  my professional works on gunnery, surveying, seamanship, mathematics,  astronomy, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, conic sections, calculus,  mechanics, and _every_ book of that description I own, including those  paperbound 'Naval Institute' papers, and put them in a box, together  with any photos, etc., you think I would like--I have none of you or Pa  or the family (including Carrie)--and send to me.    \"I just got in in time--didn't I? Another week would have been too late.  My funds were getting low; I would not have had _anything_ before long.  The U. S. Consul, General Bromley, is much pleased. The interpreter says  it was all in the way I did with the Viceroy in the interview.    \"I will have a chance to go to Peking and later to a tiger hunt in  Mongolia, but for the present I am going to study, work, and _stroke_  these mandarins till I get a raise. I am the only instructor in both  seamanship and gunnery, and I must know _everything_, both practically  and theoretically. But it will be good for me and the only thing is,  that if I were put back into the Navy I would be in a dilemma. I think  I will get my 'influence' to work, and I want you people at home to  look out, and in case I _am_--if it were represented to the Sec. that  my position here was giving me an immense lot of practical knowledge  professionally--more than I could get on a ship at sea--I think he would  give me two years' leave on half or quarter pay. Or, I would be willing  to do without pay--only to be kept on the register in my rank.    \"I will write more about this. Love to all.\"      It is characteristic of McGiffin that in the very same letter in which  he announces he has entered foreign service he plans to return to  that of his own country. This hope never left him. You find the same  homesickness for the quarterdeck of an American man-of-war all through  his later letters. At one time a bill to reinstate the midshipmen who  had been cheated of their commissions was introduced into Congress. Of  this McGiffin writes frequently as \"our bill.\" \"It may pass,\" he writes,  \"but I am tired hoping. I have hoped so long. And if it should,\" he adds  anxiously, \"there may be a time limit set in which a man must rejoin, or  lose his chance, so do not fail to let me know as quickly as you can.\"  But the bill did not pass, and McGiffin never returned to the navy that  had cut him adrift. He settled down at Tien-Tsin and taught the young  cadets how to shoot. Almost all of those who in the Chinese-Japanese War  served as officers were his pupils. As the navy grew, he grew with  it, and his position increased in importance. More Mexican dollars per  month, more servants, larger houses, and buttons of various honorable  colors were given him, and, in return, he established for China a modern  naval college patterned after our own. In those days throughout China  and Japan you could find many of these foreign advisers. Now, in Japan,  the Hon. W. H. Dennison of the Foreign Office, one of our own people, is  the only foreigner with whom the Japanese have not parted, and in China  there are none. Of all of those who have gone none served his employers  more faithfully than did McGiffin. At a time when every official  robbed the people and the Government, and when \"squeeze\" or \"graft\"  was recognized as a perquisite, McGiffin's hands were clean. The shells  purchased for the Government by him were not loaded with black sand,  nor were the rifles fitted with barrels of iron pipe. Once a year he  celebrated the Thanksgiving Day of his own country by inviting to a  great dinner all the Chinese naval officers who had been at least in  part educated in America. It was a great occasion, and to enjoy  it officers used to come from as far as Port Arthur, Shanghai, and  Hong-Kong. So fully did some of them appreciate the efforts of their  host that previous to his annual dinner, for twenty-four hours, they  delicately starved themselves.    During ten years McGiffin served as naval constructor and professor  of gunnery and seamanship, and on board ships at sea gave practical  demonstrations in the handling of the new cruisers. In 1894 he applied  for leave, which was granted, but before he had sailed for home war with  Japan was declared and he withdrew his application. He was placed  as second in command on board the _Chen Yuen_, a seven-thousand-ton  battleship, a sister ship to the _Ting Yuen_, the flagship of Admiral  Ting Ju Chang. On the memorable 17th of September, 1894, the battle of  the Yalu was fought, and so badly were the Chinese vessels hammered that  the Chinese navy, for the time being, was wiped out of existence.    From the start the advantage was with the Japanese fleet. In heavy guns  the Chinese were the better armed, but in quick-firing guns the Japanese  were vastly superior, and while the Chinese battleships _Ting Yuen_ and  _Chen Yuen_, each of 7,430 tons, were superior to any of the Japanese  warships, the three largest of which were each of 4,277 tons, the gross  tonnage of the Japanese fleet was 36,000 to 21,000 of the Chinese.  During the progress of the battle the ships engaged on each side  numbered an even dozen, but at the very start, before a decisive shot  was fired by either contestant, the _Tsi Yuen_, 2,355 tons, and _Kwan  Chiae_, 1,300 tons, ran away, and before they had time to get into the  game the _Chao Yung_ and _Yang Wei_ were in flames and had fled to the  nearest land. So the battle was fought by eight Chinese ships against  twelve of the Japanese. Of the Chinese vessels, the flagship, commanded  by Admiral Ting, and her sister ship, which immediately after the  beginning of the fight was for four hours commanded by McGiffin, were  the two chief aggressors, and in consequence received the fire of the  entire Japanese squadron. Toward the end of the fight, which without  interruption lasted for five long hours, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031"],[0,"Wild Animals I Have Known (#16)"],[1,"of the  other creatures and to make up for their own by defter play where they  are strong.    From their parents they learned the chief axioms of the fox world. How,  is not easy to say. But that they learned this in company with their  parents was clear.    Here are some that foxes taught me, without saying a word:--    Never sleep on your straight track.    Your nose is before your eyes, then trust it first.    A fool runs down the wind.    Running rills cure many ills.    Never take the open if you can keep the cover.    Never leave a straight trail if a crooked one will do.    If it's strange, it's hostile.    Dust and water burn the scent.    Never hunt mice in a rabbit-woods, or rabbits in a henyard.    Keep off the grass.    Inklings of the meanings of these were already entering the little ones'  minds--thus, 'Never follow what you can't smell,' was wise, they could  see, because if you can't smell it, then the wind is so that it must  smell you.    One by one they learned the birds and beasts of their home woods, and  then as they were able to go abroad with their parents they learned new  animals. They were beginning to think they knew the scent of everything  that moved. But one night the mother took them to a field where there  was a strange black flat thing on the ground. She brought them on  purpose to smell it, but at the first whiff their every hair stood on  end, they trembled, they knew not why--it seemed to tingle through their  blood and fill them with instinctive hate and fear.    And when she saw its full effect she told them--    \"That is man-scent.\"    III    Meanwhile the hens continued to disappear. I had not betrayed the den  of cubs. Indeed, I thought a good deal more of the little rascals than  I did of the hens; but uncle was dreadfully wrought up and made most  disparaging remarks about my woodcraft. To please him I one day took  the hound across to the woods and seating myself on a stump on the open  hillside, I bade the dog go on. Within three minutes he sang out in the  tongue all hunters know so well, \"Fox! fox! fox! straight away down the  valley.\"    After awhile I heard them coming back. There I saw the  fox--Scarface--loping lightly across the river-bottom to the stream. In  he went and trotted along in the shallow water near the margin for two  hundred yards, then came out straight toward me. Though in full view,  he saw me not but came up the hill watching over his shoulder for the  hound. Within ten feet of me he turned and sat with his back to me  while he craned his neck and showed an eager interest in the doings  of the hound. Ranger came bawling along the trail till he came to the  running water, the killer of scent, and here he was puzzled; but there  was only one thing to do; that was by going up and down both banks find  where the fox had left the river.    The fox before me shifted his position a little to get a better view and  watched with a most human interest all the circling of the hound. He was  so close that I saw the hair of his shoulder bristle a little when the  dog came in sight. I could see the jumping of his heart on his ribs,  and the gleam of his yellow eye. When the dog was wholly baulked by the  water trick, it was comical to see:--he could not sit still, but rocked  up and down in glee, and reared on his hind feet to get a better view  of the slow-plodding hound. With mouth opened nearly to his ears, though  not at all winded, he panted noisily for a moment, or rather he laughed  gleefully, just as a dog laughs by grinning and panting.    Old Scarface wriggled in huge enjoyment as the hound puzzled over the  trail so long that when he did find it, it was so stale he could barely  follow it, and did not feel justified in tonguing on it at all.    As soon as the hound was working up the hill, the fox quietly went into  the woods. I had been sitting in plain view only ten feet away, but I  had the wind and kept still and the fox never knew that his life had for  twenty minutes been in the power of the foe he most feared.    Ranger also would have passed me as near as the fox, but I spoke to him,  and with a little nervous start he quit the trail and looking sheepish  lay down by my feet.    This little comedy was played with variations for several days, but  it was all in plain view from the house across the river. My uncle,  impatient at the daily loss of hens, went out himself, sat on the open  knoll, and when old Scarface trotted to his lookout to watch the dull  hound on the river flat below, my uncle remorselessly shot him in the  back, at the very moment when he was grinning over a new triumph.    IV    But still the hens were disappearing. My uncle was wrathy. He determined  to conduct the war himself, and sowed the woods with poison baits,  trusting to luck that our own dogs would not get them. He indulged in  contemptuous remarks on my by-gone woodcraft, and went out evenings with  a gun and the two dogs, to see what he could destroy.    Vix knew right well what a poisoned bait was; she passed them by or else  treated them with active contempt, but one she dropped down the hole  of an old enemy, a skunk, who was never afterward seen. Formerly old  Scarface was always ready to take charge of the dogs, and keep them out  of mischief. But now that Vix had the whole burden of the brood, she  could no longer spend time in breaking every track to the den, and was  not always at hand to meet and mislead the foes that might be coming too  near.    The end is easily foreseen. Ranger followed a hot trail to the den, and  Spot, the fox-terrier, announced that the family was at home, and then  did his best to go in after them.    The whole secret was now out, and the whole family doomed. The hired man  came around with pick and shovel to dig them out, while we and the dogs  stood by. Old Vix soon showed herself in the near woods, and led the  dogs away off down the river, where she shook them off when she thought  proper, by the simple device of springing on a sheep's back. The  frightened animal ran for several hundred yards, then Vix got off,  knowing that there was now a hopeless gap in the scent, and returned to  the den. But the dogs, baffled by the break in the trail, soon did the  same, to find Vix hanging about in despair, vainly trying to decoy us  away from her treasures.    Meanwhile Paddy plied both pick and shovel with vigor and effect. The  yellow, gravelly sand was heaping on both sides, and the shoulders of  the sturdy digger were sinking below the level. After an hour's digging,  enlivened by frantic rushes of the dogs after the old fox, who hovered  near in the woods, Pat called:    \"Here they are, sot!\"    It was the den at the end of the burrow, and cowering as far back as  they could, were the four little woolly cubs.    Before I could interfere, a murderous blow from the shovel, and a sudden  rush for the fierce little terrier, ended the lives of three. The fourth  and smallest was barely saved by holding him by his tail high out of  reach of the excited dogs.    He gave one short squeal, and his poor mother came at the cry, and  circled so near that she would have been shot but for the accidental  protection of the dogs, who somehow always seemed to get between, and  whom she once more led away on a fruitless chase.    The little one saved alive was dropped into a bag, where he lay quite  still. His unfortunate brothers were thrown back into their nursery bed,  and buried under a few shovelfuls of earth.    We guilty ones then went back into the house, and the little fox was  soon chained in the yard. No one knew just why he was kept alive, but  in all a change of feeling had set in, and the idea of killing him was  without a supporter.    He was a pretty little fellow, like a cross between a fox and a lamb.  His woolly visage and form were strangely lamb-like and innocent, but  one could find in his yellow eyes a gleam of cunning and savageness as  unlamb-like as it possibly could be.    As long as anyone was near he crouched sullen and cowed in his  shelter-box, and it was a full hour after being left alone before he  ventured to look out.    My window now took the place of the hollow bass wood. A number of hens  of the breed he knew so well were about the cub in the yard. Late that  afternoon as they strayed near the captive there was a sudden rattle of  the chain, and the youngster dashed at the nearest one and would have  caught him but for the chain which brought him up with a jerk. He got on  his feet and slunk back to his box, and though he afterward made several  rushes he so gauged his leap as to win or fail within the length of the  chain and never again was brought up by its cruel jerk.    As night came down the little fellow became very uneasy, sneaking out of  his box, but going back at each slight alarm, tugging at his chain, or  at times biting it in fury while he held it down with his fore paws.  Suddenly he paused as though listening, then raising his little black  nose he poured out a short quavering cry. Once or twice this was  repeated, the time between being occupied in worrying the chain and  running about. Then an answer came. The far-away Yap-yurrr of the old  fox. A few minutes later a shadowy form appeared on the wood-pile. The  little one slunk into his box, but at once returned and ran to meet his  mother with all the gladness that a fox could show. Quick as a flash  she seized him and turned to bear him away by the road she came. But the  moment the end of the chain was reached the cub was rudely jerked from  the old one's mouth, and she, scared by the opening of a window, fled  over the wood-pile.    An hour afterward the cub had ceased to run about or cry. I peeped out,  and by the light of the moon saw the form of the mother at full length  on the ground by the little one, gnawing at something--the clank of iron  told what, it was that cruel chain. And Tip, the little one, meanwhile "]]]
