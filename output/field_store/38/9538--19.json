XXXVIII    No one the contrary will urge,  Though for his Helen Menelaus  Again a century should scourge  Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;  Though around honoured Priam's throne  Troy's sages should in concert own  Once more, when she appeared in sight,  Paris and Menelaus right.  But as to fighting--'twill appear!  For patience, reader, I must plead!  A little farther please to read  And be not in advance severe.  There'll be a fight. I do not lie.  My word of honour given have I.    XXXIX    The tea, as I remarked, appeared,  But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en  When in the grand saloon was heard  Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.  His soul by crash of music fired,  His tea with rum no more desired,  The Paris of those country parts  To Olga Petoushkova darts:  To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,  A marriageable maid matured,  The poet from Tamboff secured,  Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.  All to the grand saloon are gone--  The ball in all its splendour shone.    XL    I tried when I began this tale,  (See the first canto if ye will),  A ball in Peter's capital,  To sketch ye in Albano's style.(60)  But by fantastic dreams distraught,  My memory wandered wide and sought  The feet of my dear lady friends.  O feet, where'er your path extends  I long enough deceived have erred.  The perfidies I recollect  Should make me much more circumspect,  Reform me both in deed and word,  And this fifth canto ought to be  From such digressions wholly free.    [Note 60: Francesco Albano, a celebrated painter, styled the \"Anacreon  of Painting,\" was born at Bologna 1578, and died in the year 1666.]    XLI    The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,  Undeviating and insane  As giddy youth's hilarity--  Pair after pair the race sustain.  The moment for revenge, meanwhile,  Espying, Eugene with a smile  Approaches Olga and the pair  Amid the company career.  Soon the maid on a chair he seats,  Begins to talk of this and that,  But when two minutes she had sat,  Again the giddy waltz repeats.  All are amazed; but Lenski he  Scarce credits what his eyes can see.    XLII    Hark! the mazurka. In times past,  When the mazurka used to peal,  All rattled in the ball-room vast,  The parquet cracked beneath the heel,  And jolting jarred the window-frames.  'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames  We glide along a floor of wax.  However, the mazurka lacks  Nought of its charms original  In country towns, where still it keeps  Its stamping, capers and high leaps.  Fashion is there immutable,  Who tyrannizes us with ease,  Of modern Russians the disease.    XLIII    Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,  Unto the hero of this lay  Olga and Tania led. Malign,  Oneguine Olga bore away.  Gliding in negligent career,  He bending whispered in her ear  Some madrigal not worth a rush,  And pressed her hand--the crimson blush  Upon her cheek by adulation  Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath  Seen all, beside himself with wrath,  And hot with jealous indignation,  Till the mazurka's close he stays,  Her hand for the cotillon prays.    XLIV    She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--  She promised Eugene, or she would  With great delight.--O God on high!  Heard he the truth? And thus she could--  And can it be? But late a child  And now a fickle flirt and wild,  Cunning already to display  And well-instructed to betray!  Lenski the stroke could not sustain,  At womankind he growled a curse,  Departed, ordered out his horse  And galloped home. But pistols twain,  A pair of bullets--nought beside--  His fate shall presently decide.      END OF CANTO THE FIFTH        CANTO THE SIXTH    The Duel    'La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi,  Nasce una gente a cui 'l morir non duole.'                                     Petrarch    Canto The Sixth    [Mikhailovskoe, 1826: the two final stanzas were, however,  written at Moscow.]    I    Having remarked Vladimir's flight,  Oneguine, bored to death again,  By Olga stood, dejected quite  And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.  Olga began to long likewise  For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,  And endless the cotillon seemed  As if some troubled dream she dreamed.  'Tis done. To supper they proceed.  Bedding is laid out and to all  Assigned a lodging, from the hall(61)  Up to the attic, and all need  Tranquil repose. Eugene alone  To pass the night at home hath gone.    [Note 61: Hospitality is a national virtue of the Russians. On  festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually  accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights  as desired, within the house of the entertainer. This of  course is rendered necessary by the great distances which  separate the residences of the gentry. Still, the alacrity with  which a Russian hostess will turn her house topsy-turvy for  the accommodation of forty or fifty guests would somewhat  astonish the mistress of a modern Belgravian mansion.]    II    All slumber. In the drawing-room  Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff  With better half as cumbersome;  Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff  And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,  On chairs in the saloon reposed,  Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet  In jersey and in nightcap lay.  In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms  Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,  Except one by the window placed  Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--  My poor Tattiana cannot sleep  But stares into the darkness deep.    III    His visit she had not awaited,  His momentary loving glance  Her inmost soul had penetrated,  And his strange conduct at the dance  With Olga; nor of this appeared  An explanation: she was scared,  Alarmed by jealous agonies:  A hand of ice appeared to seize(62)  Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit  Beneath her roaring opened wide:  \"I shall expire,\" Tattiana cried,  \"But death from him will be delight.  I murmur not! Why mournfulness?  He _cannot_ give me happiness.\"    [Note 62: There must be a peculiar appropriateness in this expression  as descriptive of the sensation of extreme cold. Mr. Wallace  makes use of an identical phrase in describing an occasion  when he was frostbitten whilst sledging in Russia. He says  (vol. i. p. 33): \"My fur cloak flew open, the cold seemed to  _grasp me in the region of the heart_, and I fell insensible.\"]    IV    Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!  A new acquaintance we must scan.  There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,  Vladimir's property, a man  Who thrives this moment as I write,  A philosophic anchorite:  Zaretski, once a bully bold,  A gambling troop when he controlled,  Chief rascal, pot-house president,  Now of a family the head,  Simple and kindly and unwed,  True friend, landlord benevolent,  Yea! and a man of honour, lo!  How perfect doth our epoch grow!    V    Time was the flattering voice of fame,  His ruffian bravery adored,  And true, his pistol's faultless aim  An ace at fifteen paces bored.  But I must add to what I write  That, tipsy once in actual fight,  He from his Kalmuck horse did leap  In mud and mire to wallow deep,  Drunk as a fly; and thus the French  A valuable hostage gained,  A modern Regulus unchained,  Who to surrender did not blench  That every morn at Verrey's cost  Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.    VI    Time was, his raillery was gay,  He loved the simpleton to mock,  To make wise men the idiot play  Openly or 'neath decent cloak.  Yet sometimes this or that deceit  Encountered punishment complete,  And sometimes into snares as well  Himself just like a greenhorn fell.  He could in disputation shine  With pungent or obtuse retort,  At times to silence would resort,  At times talk nonsense with design;  Quarrels among young friends he bred  And to the field of honour led;    VII    Or reconciled them, it may be,  And all the three to breakfast went;  Then he'd malign them secretly  With jest and gossip gaily blent.  _Sed alia tempora_. And bravery  (Like love, another sort of knavery!)  Diminishes as years decline.  But, as I said, Zaretski mine  Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,  From storms protection having sought,  Lived as a really wise man ought,  Like Horace, planted cabbages,  Both ducks and geese in plenty bred  And lessons to his children read.    VIII    He was no fool, and Eugene mine,  To friendship making no pretence,  Admired his judgment, which was fine,  Pervaded with much common sense.  He usually was glad to see  The man and liked his company,  So, when he came next day to call,  Was not surprised thereby at all.  But, after mutual compliments,  Zaretski with a knowing grin,  Ere conversation could begin,  The epistle from the bard presents.  Oneguine to the window went  And scanned in silence its content.    IX    It was a cheery, generous  Cartel, or challenge to a fight,  Whereto in language courteous  Lenski his comrade did invite.  Oneguine, by first impulse moved,  Turned and replied as it behoved,  Curtly announcing for the fray  That he was \"ready any day.\"  Zaretski rose, nor would explain,  He cared no longer there to stay,  Had much to do at home that day,  And so departed. But Eugene,  The matter by his conscience tried,  Was with himself dissatisfied.    X    In fact, the subject analysed,  Within that secret court discussed,  In much his conduct stigmatized;  For, from the outset, 'twas unjust  To jest as he had done last eve,  A timid, shrinking love to grieve.  And ought he not to disregard  The poet's madness? for 'tis hard  At eighteen not to play the fool!  Sincerely loving him, Eugene  Assuredly should not have been  Conventionality's dull tool--  Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,  But man of sense and probity.    XI    He might his motives have narrated,  Not bristled up like a wild beast,  He ought to have conciliated  That youthful heart--\"But, now at least,  The opportunity is flown.  Besides, a duellist well-known  Hath mixed himself in the affair,  Malicious and a slanderer."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2400"],[0,"Vikram and the Vampire: Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance (#16)"],[1," time that  month, \"Where, O jay, is there a husband worthy of me?\"    \"Princess,\" replied Madan-manjari, \"I am happy at length to be able  as willing to satisfy your just curiosity. For just it is, though the  delicacy of our sex--\"    \"Now, no preaching!\" said the maiden; \"or thou shalt have salt instead  of sugar for supper.\"    Jays, your Rajaship, are fond of sugar. So the confidante retained a  quantity of good advice which she was about to produce, and replied,    \"I now see clearly the ways of Fortune. Raja Ram, king of Bhogavati, is  to be thy husband. He shall be happy in thee and thou in him, for he is  young and handsome, rich and generous, good-tempered, not too clever,  and without a chance of being an invalid.\"    Thereupon the princess, although she had never seen her future husband,  at once began to love him. In fact, though neither had set eyes upon the  other, both were mutually in love.    \"How can that be, sire?\" asked the young Dharma Dhwaj of his father. \"I  always thought that--\"    The great Vikram interrupted his son, and bade him not to ask silly  questions. Thus he expected to neutralize the evil effects of the  Baital's doctrine touching the amiability of parents unlike himself.    Now, as both these young people (resumed the Baital) were of princely  family and well to do in the world, the course of their love was  unusually smooth. When the Brahman sent by Raja Ram had reached Magadh,  and had delivered his King's homage to the Raja Magadheshwar, the latter  received him with distinction, and agreed to his proposal. The beautiful  princess's father sent for a Brahman of his own, and charging him with  nuptial gifts and the customary presents, sent him back to Bhogavati in  company with the other envoy, and gave him this order, \"Greet Raja Ram,  on my behalf, and after placing the tilak or mark upon his forehead,  return here with all speed. When you come back I will get all things  ready for the marriage.\"    Raja Ram, on receiving the deputation, was greatly pleased, and  after generously rewarding the Brahmans and making all the necessary  preparations, he set out in state for the land of Magadha, to claim his  betrothed.    In due season the ceremony took place with feasting and bands of  music, fireworks and illuminations, rehearsals of scripture, songs,  entertainments, processions, and abundant noise. And hardly had the  turmeric disappeared from the beautiful hands and feet of the bride,  when the bridegroom took an affectionate leave of his new parents--he  had not lived long in the house--and receiving the dowry and the bridal  gifts, set out for his own country.    Chandravati was dejected by leaving her mother, and therefore she  was allowed to carry with her the jay, Madanmanian. She soon told her  husband the wonderful way in which she had first heard his name, and  he related to her the advantage which he had derived from confabulation  with Churaman, his parrot.    \"Then why do we not put these precious creatures into one cage,  after marrying them according to the rites of the angelic marriage  (Gandharva-lagana)?\" said the charming queen. Like most brides, she was  highly pleased to find an opportunity of making a match.    \"Ay! why not, love? Surely they cannot live happy in what the world  calls single blessedness,\" replied the young king. As bridegrooms  sometimes are for a short time, he was very warm upon the subject of  matrimony.    Thereupon, without consulting the parties chiefly concerned in their  scheme, the master and mistress, after being comfortably settled at the  end of their journey, caused a large cage to be brought, and put into it  both their favourites.    Upon which Churaman the parrot leaned his head on one side and directed  a peculiar look at the jay. But Madan-manjari raised her beak high in  the air, puffed through it once or twice, and turned away her face in  extreme disdain.    \"Perhaps,\" quoth the parrot, at length breaking silence, \"you will tell  me that you have no desire to be married?\"    \"Probably,\" replied the jay.    \"And why?\" asked the male bird.    \"Because I don't choose,\" replied the female.    \"Truly a feminine form of resolution this,\" ejaculated the parrot. \"I  will borrow my master's words and call it a woman's reason, that is to  say, no reason at all. Have you any objection to be more explicit?\"    \"None whatever,\" retorted the jay, provoked by the rude innuendo into  telling more plainly than politely exactly what she thought; \"none  whatever, sir parrot. You he-things are all of you sinful, treacherous,  deceitful, selfish, devoid of conscience, and accustomed to sacrifice  us, the weaker sex, to your smallest desire or convenience.\"    \"Of a truth, fair lady,\" quoth the young Raja Ram to his bride, \"this  pet of thine is sufficiently impudent.\"    \"Let her words be as wind in thine ear, master,\" interrupted the parrot.  \"And pray, Mistress Jay, what are you she-things but treacherous, false,  ignorant, and avaricious beings, whose only wish in this world is to  prevent life being as pleasant as it might be?\"    \"Verily, my love,\" said the beautiful Chandravati to her bridegroom,  \"this thy bird has a habit of expressing his opinions in a very free and  easy way.\"    \"I can prove what I assert,\" whispered the jay in the ear of the  princess.    \"We can confound their feminine minds by an anecdote,\" whispered the  parrot in the ear of the prince.    Briefly, King Vikram, it was settled between the twain that each should  establish the truth of what it had advanced by an illustration in the  form of a story.    Chandravati claimed, and soon obtained, precedence for the jay. Then the  wonderful bird, Madan-manjari, began to speak as follows:--    I have often told thee, O queen, that before coming to thy feet, my  mistress was Ratnawati, the daughter of a rich trader, the dearest, the  sweetest, the----    Here the jay burst into tears, and the mistress was sympathetically  affected. Presently the speaker resumed----    However, I anticipate. In the city of Ilapur there was a wealthy  merchant, who was without offspring; on this account he was continually  fasting and going on pilgrimage, and when at home he was ever engaged in  reading the Puranas and in giving alms to the Brahmans.    At length, by favour of the Deity, a son was born to this merchant, who  celebrated his birth with great pomp and rejoicing, and gave large gifts  to Brahmans and to bards, and distributed largely to the hungry, the  thirsty, and the poor. When the boy was five years old he had him taught  to read, and when older he was sent to a guru, who had formerly himself  been a student, and who was celebrated as teacher and lecturer.    In the course of time the merchant's son grew up. Praise be to Brahma!  what a wonderful youth it was, with a face like a monkey's, legs like a  stork's, and a back like a camel's. You know the old proverb:--              Expect thirty-two villanies from the limping, and eighty  from the one-eyed man,            But when the hunchback comes, say \"Lord defend us!\"    Instead of going to study, he went to gamble with other ne'er-do-weels,  to whom he talked loosely, and whom he taught to be bad-hearted as  himself. He made love to every woman, and despite his ugliness, he was  not unsuccessful. For they are equally fortunate who are very handsome  or very ugly, in so far as they are both remarkable and remarked. But  the latter bear away the palm. Beautiful men begin well with women, who  do all they can to attract them, love them as the apples of their eyes,  discover them to be fools, hold them to be their equals, deceive them,  and speedily despise them. It is otherwise with the ugly man, who, in  consequence of his homeliness, must work his wits and take pains with  himself, and become as pleasing as he is capable of being, till women  forget his ape's face, bird's legs, and bunchy back.    The hunchback, moreover, became a Tantri, so as to complete his  villanies. He was duly initiated by an apostate Brahman, made a  declaration that he renounced all the ceremonies of his old religion,  and was delivered from their yoke, and proceeded to perform in token  of joy an abominable rite. In company with eight men and eight women-a  Brahman female, a dancing girl, a weaver's daughter, a woman of ill  fame, a washerwoman, a barber's wife, a milkmaid, and the daughter of a  land-owner--choosing the darkest time of night and the most secret part  of the house, he drank with them, was sprinkled and anointed, and went  through many ignoble ceremonies, such as sitting nude upon a dead body.  The teacher informed him that he was not to indulge shame, or aversion  to anything, nor to prefer one thing to another, nor to regard caste,  ceremonial cleanness or uncleanness, but freely to enjoy all the  pleasures of sense-that is, of course, wine and us, since we are the  representatives of the wife of Cupid, and wine prevents the senses from  going astray. And whereas holy men, holding that the subjugation or  annihilation of the passions is essential to final beatitude, accomplish  this object by bodily austerities, and by avoiding temptation, he  proceeded to blunt the edge of the passions with excessive indulgence.  And he jeered at the pious, reminding them that their ascetics are safe  only in forests, and while keeping a perpetual fast; but that he could  subdue his passions in the very presence of what they most desired.    Presently this excellent youth's father died, leaving him immense  wealth. He blunted his passions so piously and so vigorously, that in  very few years his fortune was dissipated. Then he turned towards  his neighbour's goods and prospered for a time, till being discovered  robbing, he narrowly escaped the stake. At length he exclaimed, \"Let the  gods perish! the rascals send me nothing but ill luck!\" and so saying he  arose and fled from his own country.    Chance led that villain hunchback to "]]]
