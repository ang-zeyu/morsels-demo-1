She  grew weak. It seemed at moments to her that she would faint, and then  something terrible would happen. She knew that, under penalty of Caesar's  anger, it was not permitted any one to rise till Caesar rose; but even  were that not the case, she had not strength now to rise.    Meanwhile it was far to the end of the feast yet. Slaves brought new  courses, and filled the goblets unceasingly with wine; before the table,  on a platform open at one side, appeared two athletes to give the guests  a spectacle of wrestling.    They began the struggle at once, and the powerful bodies, shining from  olive oil, formed one mass; bones cracked in their iron arms, and from  their set jaws came an ominous gritting of teeth. At moments was heard  the quick, dull thump of their feet on the platform strewn with saffron;  again they were motionless, silent, and it seemed to the spectators that  they had before them a group chiselled out of stone. Roman eyes followed  with delight the movement of tremendously exerted backs, thighs, and  arms. But the struggle was not too prolonged; for Croton, a master,  and the founder of a school of gladiators, did not pass in vain for the  strongest man in the empire. His opponent began to breathe more and more  quickly: next a rattle was heard in his throat; then his face grew blue;  finally he threw blood from his mouth and fell.    A thunder of applause greeted the end of the struggle, and Croton,  resting his foot on the breast of his opponent, crossed his gigantic  arms on his breast, and cast the eyes of a victor around the hall.    Next appeared men who mimicked beasts and their voices, ball-players  and buffoons. Only a few persons looked at them, however, since wine had  darkened the eyes of the audience. The feast passed by degrees into a  drunken revel and a dissolute orgy. The Syrian damsels, who appeared  at first in the bacchic dance, mingled now with the guests. The music  changed into a disordered and wild outburst of citharas, lutes, Armenian  cymbals, Egyptian sistra, trumpets, and horns. As some of the guests  wished to talk, they shouted at the musicians to disappear. The air,  filled with the odor of flowers and the perfume of oils with which  beautiful boys had sprinkled the feet of the guests during the feast,  permeated with saffron and the exhalations of people, became stifling;  lamps burned with a dim flame; the wreaths dropped sidewise on the heads  of guests; faces grew pale and were covered with sweat. Vitelius rolled  under the table. Nigidia, stripping herself to the waist, dropped  her drunken childlike head on the breast of Lucan, who, drunk in like  degree, fell to blowing the golden powder from her hair, and raising  his eyes with immense delight. Vestinius, with the stubbornness of  intoxication, repeated for the tenth time the answer of Mopsus to the  sealed letter of the proconsul. Tullius, who reviled the gods,  said, with a drawling voice broken by hiccoughs,--\"If the spheros of  Xenophanes is round, then consider, such a god might be pushed along  before one with the foot, like a barrel.\"    But Domitius Afer, a hardened criminal and informer, was indignant at  the discourse, and through indignation spilled Falernian over his whole  tunic. He had always believed in the gods. People say that Rome will  perish, and there are some even who contend that it is perishing  already. And surely! But if that should come, it is because the youth  are without faith, and without faith there can be no virtue. People have  abandoned also the strict habits of former days, and it never occurs  to them that Epicureans will not stand against barbarians. As for him,  he--As for him, he was sorry that he had lived to such times, and that  he must seek in pleasures a refuge against griefs which, if not met,  would soon kill him.    When he had said this, he drew toward him a Syrian dancer, and kissed  her neck and shoulders with his toothless mouth. Seeing this, the consul  Memmius Regulus laughed, and, raising his bald head with wreath awry,  exclaimed,--\"Who says that Rome is perishing? What folly! I, a consul,  know better. Videant consules! Thirty legions are guarding our pax  romana!\"    Here he put his fists to his temples and shouted, in a voice heard  throughout the triclinium,--\"Thirty legions! thirty legions! from  Britain to the Parthian boundaries!\" But he stopped on a sudden, and,  putting a finger to his forehead, said,--\"As I live, I think there are  thirty-two.\" He rolled under the table, and began soon to send forth  flamingo tongues, roast and chilled mushrooms, locusts in honey, fish,  meat, and everything which he had eaten or drunk.    But the number of the legions guarding Roman peace did not pacify  Domitius.    No, no! Rome must perish; for faith in the gods was lost, and so were  strict habits! Rome must perish; and it was a pity, for still life was  pleasant there. Caesar was gracious, wine was good! Oh, what a pity!    And hiding his head on the arm of a Syrian bacchanal, he burst into  tears. \"What is a future life! Achilles was right,--better be a slave  in the world beneath the sun than a king in Cimmerian regions. And  still the question whether there are any gods--since it is unbelief--is  destroying the youth.\"    Lucan meanwhile had blown all the gold powder from Nigidia's hair, and  she being drunk had fallen asleep. Next he took wreaths of ivy from  the vase before him, put them on the sleeping woman, and when he had  finished looked at those present with a delighted and inquiring glance.  He arrayed himself in ivy too, repeating, in a voice of deep conviction,  \"I am not a man at all, but a faun.\"    Petronius was not drunk; but Nero, who drank little at first, out of  regard for his \"heavenly\" voice, emptied goblet after goblet toward the  end, and was drunk. He wanted even to sing more of his verses,--this  time in Greek,--but he had forgotten them, and by mistake sang an ode of  Anacreon. Pythagoras, Diodorus, and Terpnos accompanied him; but failing  to keep time, they stopped. Nero as a judge and an aesthete was enchanted  with the beauty of Pythagoras, and fell to kissing his hands in ecstasy.  \"Such beautiful hands I have seen only once, and whose were they?\" Then  placing his palm on his moist forehead, he tried to remember. After a  while terror was reflected on his face.    Ah! His mother's--Agrippina's!    And a gloomy vision seized him forthwith.    \"They say,\" said he, \"that she wanders by moonlight on the sea around  Baiae and Bauli. She merely walks,--walks as if seeking for something.  When she comes near a boat, she looks at it and goes away; but the  fisherman on whom she has fixed her eye dies.\"    \"Not a bad theme,\" said Petronius.    But Vestinius, stretching his neck like a stork, whispered  mysteriously,--\"I do not believe in the gods; but I believe in  spirits--Oi!\"    Nero paid no attention to their words, and continued,--\"I celebrated the  Lemuria, and have no wish to see her. This is the fifth year--I had  to condemn her, for she sent assassins against me; and, had I not been  quicker than she, ye would not be listening to-night to my song.\"    \"Thanks be to Caesar, in the name of the city and the world!\" cried  Domitius Afer.    \"Wine! and let them strike the tympans!\"    The uproar began anew. Lucan, all in ivy, wishing to outshout him, rose  and cried,--\"I am not a man, but a faun; and I dwell in the forest.  Eho-o-o-oo!\" Caesar drank himself drunk at last; men were drunk, and  women were drunk. Vinicius was not less drunk than others; and in  addition there was roused in him, besides desire, a wish to quarrel,  which happened always when he passed the measure. His dark face became  paler, and his tongue stuttered when he spoke, in a voice now loud and  commanding,--\"Give me thy lips! To-day, to-morrow, it is all one! Enough  of this!    \"Caesar took thee from Aulus to give thee to me, dost understand?  To-morrow, about dusk, I will send for thee, dost understand? Caesar  promised thee to me before he took thee. Thou must be mine! Give me thy  lips! I will not wait for to-morrow,--give thy lips quickly.\"    And he moved to embrace her; but Acte began to defend her, and she  defended herself with the remnant of her strength, for she felt that she  was perishing. But in vain did she struggle with both hands to remove  his hairless arm; in vain, with a voice in which terror and grief were  quivering, did she implore him not to be what he was, and to have pity  on her. Sated with wine, his breath blew around her nearer and nearer,  and his face was there near her face. He was no longer the former kind  Vinicius, almost dear to her soul; he was a drunken, wicked satyr, who  filled her with repulsion and terror. But her strength deserted her  more and more. In vain did she bend and turn away her face to escape his  kisses. He rose to his feet, caught her in both arms, and drawing her  head to his breast, began, panting, to press her pale lips with his.    But at this instant a tremendous power removed his arms from her neck  with as much ease as if they had been the arms of a child, and pushed  him aside, like a dried limb or a withered leaf. What had happened?  Vinicius rubbed his astonished eyes, and saw before him the gigantic  figure of the Lygian, called Ursus, whom he had seen at the house of  Aulus.    Ursus stood calmly, but looked at Vinicius so strangely with his blue  eyes that the blood stiffened in the veins of the young man; then the  giant took his queen on his arm, and walked out of the triclinium with  an even, quiet step.    Acte in that moment went after him.    Vinicius sat for the twinkle of an eye as if petrified; then he sprang  up and ran toward the entrance crying,--\"Lygia! Lygia!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#16)"],[1,"heaven.\"    We know what the \"similitude\" of the sun and the moon were like among  the surrounding nations. We see their \"hieroglyphs\" on numberless seals  and images from the ruins of Nineveh or Babylon. That of the sun was  first a rayed star or disc, later a figure, rayed and winged. That of  the moon was a crescent, one lying on its back, like a bowl or cup, the  actual attitude of the new moon at the beginning of the new year. Just  such moon similitudes did the soldiers of Gideon take from off the  camels of Zebah and Zalmunna; just such were the \"round tires like the  moon\" that Isaiah condemns among the bravery of the daughters of Zion.    The similitude or token of Ashtoreth, the paramount goddess of the  Zidonians, was the _ashera_, the \"grove\" of the Authorized Version,  probably in most cases merely a wooden pillar. This goddess, \"the  abomination of the Zidonians,\" was a moon-goddess, concerning whom  Eusebius preserves a statement by the Phoenician historian,  Sanchoniathon, that her images had the head of an ox. In the wars in  the days of Abraham we find Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with  him, smiting the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, that is, in the  Ashtoreths \"of the horns.\" It is impossible to decide at this date  whether the horns which gave the distinctive title to this shrine of  Ashtoreth owed their origin to the horns of the animal merged in the  goddess, or to the horns of the crescent moon, with which she was to  some extent identified. Possibly there was always a confusion between  the two in the minds of her worshippers. The cult of Ashtoreth was  spread not only among the Hebrews, but throughout the whole plain of  Mesopotamia. In the times of the Judges, and in the days of Samuel, we  find continually the statement that the people \"served Baalim and  Ashtaroth\"--the plurals of Baal and Ashtoreth--these representing the  sun and moon, and reigning as king and queen in heaven. When the  Philistines fought with Saul at Mount Gilboa, and he was slain, they  stripped off his armour and put it \"in the house of Ashtaroth.\" Yet  later we find that Solomon loved strange women of the Zidonians, who  turned his heart after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and he  built a high place for her on the right hand of the Mount of Olives,  which remained for some three and a half centuries, until Josiah, the  king, defiled it. Nevertheless, the worship of Ashtoreth continued, and  the prophet Jeremiah describes her cult:--         \"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,       and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of       heaven.\"    This was done in the cities of Judah and streets of Jerusalem, but the  Jews carried the cult with them even when they fled into Egypt, and  whilst there they answered Jeremiah--         \"We will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our       own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to       pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and       our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of       Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty       of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left       off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out       drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have       been consumed by the sword and by the famine.\"    _Ashtoreth_, according to Pinches[90:1] is evidently a lengthening of  the name of the Assyrio-Babylonian goddess I[vs]tar, and the Babylonian  legend of the Descent of I[vs]tar may well have been a myth founded on  the varying phases of the moon. But it must be remembered that, though  Ashtoreth or I[vs]tar might be the queen of heaven, the moon was not  necessarily the only aspect in which her worshippers recognized her. In  others, the planet Venus may have been chosen as her representative; in  others the constellation Taurus, at one time the leader of the Zodiac;  in others, yet again, the actual form of a material bull or cow.    The Hebrews recognized the great superiority in brightness of the sun  over the moon, as testified in their names of the \"greater\" and \"lesser\"  lights, and in such passages as that already quoted from Isaiah (xxx.  26). The word here used for moon is the poetic one, _lebanah_. Of course  no argument can be founded on the parallelism employed so as to lead to  the conclusion that the Hebrews considered that the solar light exceeded  the lunar by only seven times, instead of the 600,000 times indicated by  modern photometric measurement.    In only one instance in Scripture--that already quoted of the moon  withdrawing itself--is there even an allusion to the changing phases of  the moon, other than that implied in the frequent references to the new  moons. The appointment of certain feasts to be held on the fifteenth day  of the month is a confirmation of the supposition that their months were  truly lunar, for then the moon is fully lighted, and rides the sky the  whole night long from sunset to sunrise. It is clear, therefore, that  the Hebrews, not only noticed the phases of the moon, but made regular  use of them. Yet, if we adopted the argument from silence, we should  suppose that they had never observed its changes of shape, for there is  no direct allusion to them in Scripture. We cannot, therefore, argue  from silence as to whether or no they had divined the cause of those  changes, namely that the moon shines by reflecting the light of the sun.    Nor are there any references to the markings on the moon. It is quite  obvious to the naked eye that there are grey stains upon her silver  surface, that these grey stains are always there, most of them forming a  chain which curves through the upper hemisphere. Of the bright parts of  the moon, some shine out with greater lustre than others, particularly  one spot in the lower left-hand quadrant, not far from the edge of the  full disc. The edges of the moon gleam more brightly as a rule than the  central parts. All this was apparent to the Hebrews of old, as it is to  our unassisted sight to-day.    The moon's influence in raising the tides is naturally not mentioned.  The Hebrews were not a seafaring race, nor are the tides on the coast of  Palestine pronounced enough to draw much attention. One influence is  ascribed to the moon; an influence still obscure, or even disputed. For  the promise that--         \"The sun shall not smite thee by day,          Nor the moon by night,\"    quite obvious in its application to the sun, with the moon seems to  refer to its supposed influence on certain diseases and in causing  \"moon-blindness.\"    The chief function of the moon, as indicated in Scripture, is to  regulate the calendar, and mark out the times for the days of solemnity.  In the words of the 104th Psalm:--         \"He (God) appointed the moon for seasons:        The sun knoweth his going down.        Thou makest darkness, and it is night;        Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.        The young lions roar after their prey,        And seek their meat from God.        The sun ariseth, they get them away,        And lay them down in their dens.        Man goeth forth unto his work        And to his labour until the evening.        O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!        In wisdom hast Thou made them all:        The earth is full of Thy riches.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [81:1] How the little children must have revelled in that yearly  holiday!    [90:1] T. G.

The \"America Nebula\": photographed by Dr. Max Wolf, at Heidelberg.]          CHAPTER VIII    THE STARS      The stars and the heaven, whose host they are, were used by the Hebrew  writers to express the superlatives of number, of height, and of  expanse. To an observer, watching the heavens at any particular time and  place, not more than some two thousand stars are separately visible to  the unassisted sight. But it was evident to the Hebrew, as it is to any  one to-day, that the stars separately visible do not by any means make  up their whole number. On clear nights the whole vault of heaven seems  covered with a tapestry or curtain the pattern of which is formed of  patches of various intensities of light, and sprinkled upon this  patterned curtain are the brighter stars that may be separately seen.  The most striking feature in the pattern is the Milky Way, and it may be  easily discerned that its texture is made up of innumerable minute  points of light, a granulation, of which some of the grains are set more  closely together, forming the more brilliant patches, and some more  loosely, giving the darker shades. The mind easily conceives that the  minute points of light whose aggregations make up the varying pattern of  the Milky Way, though too small to be individually seen, are also  stars, differing perhaps from the stars of the Pleiades or the Bears  only in their greater distance or smaller size. It was of all these that  the Lord said to Abram--         \"Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able       to number them: and He said unto him, So shall thy seed be.\"    The first catalogue of the stars of which we have record was that of  Hipparchus in 129 B.C. It contained 1,025 stars, and Ptolemy brought  this catalogue up to date in the Almagest of 137 A.D. Tycho Brahe in  1602 made a catalogue of 777 stars, and Kepler republished this in 1627,  and increased the number to 1,005. These were before the invention of  the telescope, and consequently contained only naked-eye stars. Since  astronomers have been able to sound the heavens more deeply, catalogues  have increased in size and number. Flamsteed, the first Astronomer  Royal, made one of 3,310 stars; from the observations of Bradley, the  third, a yet more"]]]
