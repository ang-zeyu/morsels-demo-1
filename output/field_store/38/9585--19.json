The mothers wailed aloud, the children cried, and the tumult  grew until Constantine heard it, where he sat lonely and wretched in  his darkened room. He looked out of his window on the mournful sight  in the courtyard, and was roused as from a trance, saying to himself:  \"O Divine Providence, who hast formed all men alike, lo! the poor man  is born, lives, suffers, and dies, just as does the rich; to wise man  and fool alike come sickness and health; and no man may avoid that  fortune which Nature's law hath ordained for him. Likewise to all men  are Nature's gifts of strength and beauty, of soul and reason, freely  and fully given, so that the poor child is born as capable of virtue  as the king's son; and to each man is given free will to choose virtue  or vice. Yet thou givest to men diversity of rank, wealth or poverty,  lordship or servitude, not always according to their deserts; so much  the more virtuous should that man be to whom thou hast put other men  in subjection, men who are nevertheless his fellows and wear his  likeness. Thou, O God, who hast put Nature and the whole universe  under law, wouldst have all men rule themselves by law, and thou hast  said that a man must do to others such things as he would have done to  himself.\"      His Noble Resolve    Thus Constantine spoke within himself as he stood by the window and  looked upon the weeping mothers and children, the very sentinels of  his palace pitying them, and trying in vain to comfort them; and a  strife grew strong within him between his natural longing for healing  and deliverance from this loathsome disease which had darkened his  life, and the pity he felt for these poor creatures, and his horror at  the thought of so much human blood to be shed for himself alone. The  great moaning of the woeful mothers came to him and the pitiful crying  of the children, and he thought: \"What am I that my health is to  outweigh the lives and happiness of so many of my people? Is my life  of more value to the world than those of all the children who must  shed their blood for my healing? Surely each babe is as precious as  Constantine the Emperor!\" Thus his heart grew so tender and so full of  compassion that he chose rather to die by this terrible sickness than  to commit so great a slaughter of innocent children, and he renounced  all other physicians, and trusted himself wholly to God's care.      He Announces his Determination    He at once summoned his council, and announced to them his resolution,  giving as his reason, \"He that will be truly master must be ever  servant to pity!\" and without delay the anxious mothers were told  that their children were free and safe, for the emperor had renounced  the cure, and needed their blood no longer. What raptures of rejoicing  there were, what outpouring of blessing on the emperor, what songs of  praise and thanks from the women wild with joy, cannot be fully told;  and yet greater grew their joy and thankfulness when Constantine,  calling his high officials, bade them take all his gathered treasures  and distribute them among the poor women, that they might feed and  clothe their children, and so return home untouched by any loss, and  recompensed in some degree for their sufferings. Thus did Constantine  obey the behests of pity, and try to atone for the wrong to which he  had consented in his heart, and which he had so nearly done to his  people.      The Victims Sent Home Happy    Home to all parts of the Roman Empire went the women, bearing with  them their happy children, and the rich gifts they had received. Each  one thanked and blessed the emperor, and sang his praises, where  before she had passed with tears and bitter curses on his head; each  woman shared her joy with her neighbours; and the very children learnt  from their mothers and fathers to pray for the healing of their great  lord, who had given up his own will and sacrificed his own cure for  gentle pity's sake. Thus the whole world prayed for Constantine's  healing.      A Vision    Lo! it never yet was known that charity went unrequited and this  Constantine now learnt in his own glad experience; for that same  night, as he lay asleep, God sent to him a vision of two strangers,  men of noble face and form, whom he reverenced greatly, and who said  to him: \"O Constantine, because thou hast obeyed the voice of pity,  thou hast deserved pity; therefore shalt thou find such mercy, that  God, in His great pity, will save thee. Double healing shalt thou  receive, first for thy body, and next for thy woeful soul; both alike  shall be made whole. And that thou mayst not despair, God will grant  thee a sign--thy leprosy shall not increase till thou hast sent to  Mount Celion, to Sylvester and all his clergy. There they dwell in  secret for dread of thee, who hast been a foe to the law of Christ,  and hast destroyed those who preach in His Holy Name. Now thou hast  appeased God somewhat by thy good deed, since thou hast had pity on  the innocent blood, and hast spared it; for this thou shalt find  teaching, from Sylvester, to the salvation of both body and soul. Thou  wilt need no other leech.\" The emperor, who had listened with  eagerness and awe, now spoke: \"Great thanks I owe to you, my lords,  and I will indeed do as ye have said; but one thing I would pray  you--what shall I tell Sylvester of the name or estate of those who  send me to him?\" The two strangers said: \"We are the Apostles Peter  and Paul, who endured death here in thy city of Rome for the Holy Name  of Christ, and we bid Sylvester teach and baptize thee into the true  faith. So shall the Roman Empire become the kingdom of the Lord and of  His Christ.\" So saying, they blessed him, and passed into the heavens  out of his sight, and Constantine awoke from his slumber and knew that  he had seen a vision. He called aloud eagerly, and his servants  waiting in an outer room ran in to him quickly, for there was urgency  in his voice. To them Constantine told his vision and the command  which was laid upon him.      Sylvester Summoned    Messengers rode in hot haste to Mount Celion, and inquired long and  anxiously for Sylvester. At last they found him, a holy and venerable  man, and summoned him, saying: \"The Emperor calls for thee: come,  therefore, at once.\" Sylvester's clergy were greatly affrighted, not  knowing what this summons might mean, and dreading the death of their  dear bishop and master; but he went forth gladly, not knowing to what  fate he was going. When he was brought to the palace the emperor  greeted him kindly, and told him all his dream, and the command of the  Apostles Peter and Paul, and ended with these words: \"Now I have done  as the vision bade, and have fetched thee here: tell me, I pray, the  glad tidings which shall bring healing to my body and soul.\" When  Sylvester heard this speech he was filled with joy and wonder, and  thanked God for the vision He had sent to the emperor, and then he  began to preach to him the Christian faith: he told of the Fall of  Man, and the redemption of the world by the death and resurrection of  Jesus Christ, of the Ascension of Jesus and His return at the Day of  Judgment, of the justice of God, who will judge all men impartially  according to their works, good or bad, and of the life of joy or  misery to come. As Sylvester taught, the monarch listened and  believed, and, when the tale was ended, announced his conversion to  the true faith, and said he was ready, with his whole heart and soul,  to be baptized.      Constantine Baptized    At the emperor's command, they took the great vessel of silver which  had been made for the children's blood, and Sylvester bade them fill  it with pure water from the well. When that was done with all haste,  he bade Constantine stand therein, so that the water reached his chin.  As the holy rite began a great light like the sun's rays shone from  heaven into the place, and upon Constantine; and as the sacred words  were being read there fell now and again from his body scales like  those of a fish, till there was nothing left of his horrible disease;  and thus in baptism Constantine was purified in body and soul.    [Illustration: They filled the great vessel of silver with pure water]          CHAPTER V: HAVELOK THE DANE      The Origin of the Story    The Danish occupation of England has left a very strong mark on our  country in various ways--on its place-names, its racial  characteristics, its language, its literature, and, in part, on its  ideals. The legend of Havelok the Dane, with its popularity and  widespread influence, is one result of Danish supremacy. It is thought  that the origin of the legend, which contains a twofold version of the  common story of the cruel guardian and the persecuted heir, is to be  found in Wales; but, however that may be, it is certain that in the  continual rise and fall of small tribal kingdoms, Celtic or Teutonic,  English or Danish, the circumstances out of which the story grew must  have been common enough. Kings who died leaving helpless heirs to the  guardianship of ambitious and wicked nobles were not rare in the early  days of Britain, Wales, or Denmark; the murder of the heir and the  usurpation of the kingdom by the cruel regent were no unusual  occurrences. The opportunity of localising the early legend seems to  have come with the growing fame of Anlaf, or Olaf, Sihtricson, who was  known to the Welsh as Abloec or Habloc. His adventurous life included  a threefold expulsion from his inheritance of Northumbria, a marriage  with the daughter of King Constantine III. of Scotland, and a family  kinship with King Athelstan of England. In Anlaf Curan (as he was  called) we have an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#16)"],[1,"certain.    \"This is a thing which we must hold council over,\" Menlik continued.  \"But it is an idea of power. Yes, one to think about, Lord. And I shall  think....\"    He got up and moved away. Travis blinked at the fire. He was very tired,  and he disliked sleeping in this camp. But he must not go without the  rest his body needed to supply him with a clear head in the morning. And  not showing uneasiness might be one way of winning Menlik's confidence.          9      Travis settled his back against the spire of rock and raised his right  hand into the path of the sun, cradling in his palm a disk of glistening  metal. Flash ... flash ... he made the signal pattern just as his  ancestors a hundred years earlier and far across space had used trade  mirrors to relay war alerts among the Chiricahua and White Mountain  ranges. If Tsoay had returned safely, and if Buck had kept the agreed  lookout on that peak a mile or so ahead, then the clan would know that  he was coming and with what escort.    He waited now, rubbing the small metal mirror absently on the loose  sleeve of his shirt, waiting for a reply. Mirrors were best, not smoke  fires which would broadcast too far the presence of men in the hills.  Tsoay must have returned....    \"What is it that you do?\"    Menlik, his shaman's robe pulled up so that his breeches and boots were  dark against the golden rock, climbed up beside the Apache. Menlik,  Hulagur, and Kaydessa were riding with Travis, offering him one of  their small ponies to hurry the trip. He was still regarded warily by  the Tatars, but he did not blame them for their cautious attitude.    \"Ah--\" A flicker of light from the point ahead. One ... two ... three  flashes, a pause, then two more together. He had been read. Buck had  dispatched scouts to meet them, and knowing his people's skill at the  business, Travis was certain the Tatars would never suspect their  flanking unless the Apaches purposefully revealed themselves. Also the  Tatars were not to go to the rancheria, but would be met at a mid-point  by a delegation of Apaches. This was no time for the Tatars to learn  just how few the clan numbered.    Menlik watched Travis flash an acknowledgment to the sentry ahead. \"In  this way you speak to your men?\"    \"This way I speak.\"    \"A thing good and to be remembered. We have the drum, but that is for  the ears of all with hearing. This is for the eyes only of those on  watch for it. Yes, a good thing. And your people--they will meet with  us?\"    \"They wait ahead,\" Travis confirmed.    It was close to midday and the heat, gathered in the rocky ways, was  like a heaviness in the air itself. The Tatars had shucked their heavy  jackets and rolled the fur brims of their hats far up their heads away  from their sweat-beaded faces. And at every halt they passed from hand  to hand the skin bag of kumiss.    Now even the ponies shuffled on with drooping heads, picking a way in a  cut which deepened into a canyon. Travis kept a watch for the scouts.  And not for the first time he thought of the disappearance of the  coyotes. Somehow, back in the Tatar camp, he had counted confidently on  the animals' rejoining him once he had started his return over the  mountains.    But he had seen nothing of either beast, nor had he felt that  unexplainable mental contact with them which had been present since his  first awakening on Topaz. Why they had left him so unceremoniously after  defending him from the Mongol attack, and why they were keeping  themselves aloof now, he did not know. But he was conscious of a thread  of alarm for their continued absence, and he hoped he would find they  had gone back to the rancheria.    The ponies thudded dispiritedly along a sandy wash which bottomed the  canyon. Here the heat became a leaden weight and the men were panting  like four-footed beasts running before hunters. Finally Travis sighted  what he had been seeking, a flicker of movement on the wall well above.  He flung up his hand, pulling his mount to a stand. Apaches stood in  full view, bows ready, arrows on cords. But they made no sound.    Kaydessa cried out, booted her mount to draw equal with Travis.    \"A trap!\" Her face, flushed with heat, was also stark with anger.    Travis smiled slowly. \"Is there a rope about you, Wolf Daughter?\" he  inquired softly. \"Are you now dragged across this sand?\"    Her mouth opened and then closed again. The quirt she had half raised to  slash at him, flopped across her pony's neck.    The Apache glanced back at the two men. Hulagur's hand was on his sword  hilt, his eyes darting from one of those silent watchers to the next.  But the utter hopelessness of the Tatar position was too plain. Only  Menlik made no move toward any weapon, even his spirit wand. Instead, he  sat quietly in the saddle, displaying no emotion toward the Apaches save  his usual self-confident detachment.    \"We go on.\" Travis pointed ahead.    Just as suddenly as they had appeared from the heart of the golden  cliffs, so did the scouts vanish. Most of them were already on their way  to the point Buck had selected for the meeting place. There had been  only six men up there, but the Tatars had no way of knowing just how  large a portion of the whole clan that number was.    Travis' pony lifted his head, nickered, and achieved a stumbling trot.  Somewhere ahead was water, one of those oases of growth and life which  pocked the whole mountain range--to the preservation of all animals and  all men.    Menlik and Hulagur pushed on until their mounts were hard on the heels  of the two ridden by the girl and Travis. Travis wondered if they still  waited for some arrow to strike home, though he saw that both men rode  with outward disregard for the patrolling scouts.    A grass-leaf bush beckoned them on and again the ponies quickened pace,  coming out into a tributary canyon which housed a small pool and a good  stand of grass and brush. To one side of the water Buck stood, his arms  folded across his chest, armed only with his belt knife. Grouped behind  him were Deklay, Tsoay, Nolan, Manulito--Travis tabulated hurriedly.  Manulito and Deklay were to be classed together--or had been when he was  last in the rancheria. On Buck's stairway from the past, both had  halted more than halfway down. Nolan was a quiet man who seldom spoke,  and whose opinion Travis could not foretell. Tsoay would back Buck.    Probably such a divided party was the best Travis could have hoped to  gather. A delegation composed entirely of those who were ready to leave  the past of the Redax--a collection of Bucks and Jil-Lees--was outside  the bounds of possibility. But Travis was none too happy to have Deklay  in on this.    Travis dismounted, letting the pony push forward by himself to dip nose  into the pool.    \"This is,\" Travis pointed politely with his chin--\"Menlik, one who talks  with spirits.... Hulagur, who is son to a chief ... and Kaydessa, who is  daughter to a chief. They are of the horse people of the north.\" He made  the introduction carefully in English.    Then he turned to the Tatars. \"Buck, Deklay, Nolan, Manulito, Tsoay,\" he  named them all, \"these stand to listen, and to speak for the Apaches.\"    But sometime later when the two parties sat facing each other, he  wondered whether a common decision could come from the clansmen on his  side of that irregular circle. Deklay's expression was closed; he had  even edged a short way back, as if he had no desire to approach the  strangers. And Travis read into every line of Deklay's body his distrust  and antagonism.    He himself began to speak, retelling his adventures since they had  followed Kaydessa's trail, sketching in the situation at the  Tatar-Mongol settlement as he had learned it from her and from Menlik.  He was careful to speak in English so that the Tatars could hear all he  was reporting to his own kind. And the Apaches listened blank-faced,  though Tsoay must already have reported much of this. When Travis was  done it was Deklay who asked a question:    \"What have we to do with these people?\"    \"There is this--\" Travis chose his words carefully, thinking of what  might move a warrior still conditioned to riding with the raiders of a  hundred years earlier, \"the Pinda-lick-o-yi (whom we call 'Reds,') are  never willing to live side by side with any who are not of their mind.  And they have weapons such as make our bow cords bits of rotten string,  our knives slivers of rust. They do not kill; they enslave. And when  they discover that we live, then they will come against us--\"    Deklay's lips moved in a wolf grin. \"This is a large land, and we know  how to use it. The Pinda-lick-o-yi will not find us--\"    \"With their eyes maybe not,\" Travis replied. \"With their machines--that  is another matter.\"    \"Machines!\" Deklay spat. \"Always these machines.... Is that all you can  talk about? It would seem that you are bewitched by these machines,  which we have not seen--none of us!\"    \"It was a machine which brought you here,\" Buck observed. \"Go you back  and look upon the spaceship and remember, Deklay. The knowledge of the  Pinda-lick-o-yi is greater than ours when it deals with metal and wire  and things which can be made with both. Machines brought us along the  road of the stars, and there is no tracker in the clan who could hope to  do the same. But now I have this to ask: Does our brother have a plan?\"    \"Those who are Reds,\" Travis answered slowly, \"they do not number many.  But more may later come from our own world. Have you heard of such  arriving?\" he asked Menlik.    \"Not so, but we are not told much. We live apart and no one of us goes  to the ship unless he is summoned. For they have weapons to guard them,  or long since they would have been dead. It is not proper for a man to  eat from the pot, ride in the wind, sleep easy under the same sky with  him who has slain his brother.\"    \"They have then killed among your people?\"    \"They"]]]
