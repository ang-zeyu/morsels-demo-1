This final degree of regeneration is saving, and  the Christian will, must, attain it; but it doth not yet  appear. Until this be attained, the Christian Scientist [5]  must continue to strive with sickness, sin, and death--  though in lessening degrees--and manifest growth at  every experience.    _Is it correct to say of material objects, that they are noth-_  _ing and exist only in imagination?_ [10]    _Nothing_ and _something_ are words which need correct  definition. They either mean formations of indefinite  and vague human opinions, or scientific classifications  of the unreal and the real. My sense of the beauty of  the universe is, that beauty typifies holiness, and is some- [15]  thing to be desired. Earth is more spiritually beautiful  to my gaze now than when it was more earthly to the  eyes of Eve. The pleasant sensations of human belief,  of form and color, must be spiritualized, until we gain the  glorified sense of substance as in the new heaven and [20]  earth, the harmony of body and Mind.    Even the human conception of beauty, grandeur, and  utility is something that defies a sneer. It is more than  imagination. It is next to divine beauty and the gran-  deur of Spirit. It lives with our earth-life, and is [25]  the subjective state of high thoughts. The atmos-  phere of mortal mind constitutes our mortal envi-  ronment. What mortals hear, see, feel, taste, smell,  constitutes their present earth and heaven: but we must  grow out of even this pleasing thraldom, and find wings [30]  to reach the glory of supersensible Life; then we shall    [Page 87.]    soar above, as the bird in the clear ether of the blue tem- [1]  poral sky.    To take all earth's beauty into one gulp of vacuity  and label beauty nothing, is ignorantly to caricature  God's creation, which is unjust to human sense and [5]  to the divine realism. In our immature sense of spirit-  ual things, let us say of the beauties of the sensuous  universe: \"I love your promise; and shall know, some  time, the spiritual reality and substance of form, light,  and color, of what I now through you discern dimly; and [10]  knowing this, I shall be satisfied. Matter is a frail con-  ception of mortal mind; and mortal mind is a poorer  representative of the beauty, grandeur, and glory of the  immortal Mind.\"    _Please inform us through your Journal; if you sent_ [15]  _Mrs. ---- to ----. She said that you sent her there to look_  _after the students; and also, that no one there was working_  _in Science,--which is certainly a mistake._    I never commission any one to teach students of mine.  After class teaching, he does best in the investigation of [20]  Christian Science who is most reliant on himself and  God. My students are taught the divine Principle and  rules of the Science of Mind-healing. What they need  thereafter is to study thoroughly the Scriptures and  \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.\" To [25]  watch and pray, to be honest, earnest, loving, and truth-  ful, is indispensable to the demonstration of the truth  they have been taught.    If they are haunted by obsequious helpers, who, un-  called for, imagine they can help anybody and steady [30]  God's altar--this interference prolongs the struggle    [Page 88.]    and tends to blight the fruits of my students. A faith- [1]  ful student may even sometimes feel the need of  physical help, and occasionally receive it from others;  but the less this is required, the better it is for that  student. [5]    _Please give us, through your Journal, the name of_  _the author of that genuine critique in the September_  _number, __\"__What Quibus Thinks.__\"_    I am pleased to inform this inquirer, that the author  of the article in question is a Boston gentleman whose [10]  thought is appreciated by many liberals. Patience, ob-  servation, intellectual culture, reading, writing, exten-  sive travel, and twenty years in the pulpit, have equipped  him as a critic who knows whereof he speaks. His allu-  sion to Christian Science in the following paragraph, [15]  glows in the shadow of darkling criticism like a mid-  night sun. Its manly honesty follows like a benediction  after prayer, and closes the task of talking to deaf ears  and dull debaters.    \"We have always insisted that this Science is natural, [20]  spiritually natural; that Jesus was the highest type of  real nature; that Christian healing is supernatural, or  extra-natural, only to those who do not enter into its  sublimity or understand its modes--as imported ice  was miraculous to the equatorial African, who had never [25]  seen water freeze.\"    _Is it right for a Scientist to treat with a doctor?_    This depends upon what kind of a doctor it is. Mind-  healing, and healing with drugs, are opposite modes of  medicine. As a rule, drop one of these doctors when you [30]    [Page 89.]    employ the other. The Scripture saith, \"No man can [1]  serve two masters;\" and, \"Every kingdom divided  against itself is brought to desolation.\"    _If Scientists are called upon to care for a member of_  _the family, or a friend in sickness, who is employing a_ [5]  _regular physician, would it be right to treat this patient_  _at all; and ought the patient to follow the doctor's_  _directions?_    When patients are under material medical treatment,  it is advisable in most cases that Scientists do not treat [10]  them, or interfere with _materia medica_. If the patient  is in peril, and you save him or alleviate his sufferings,  although the medical attendant and friends have no  faith in your method, it is humane, and not unchristian,  to do him all the good you can; but your good will gen- [15]  erally \"be evil spoken of.\" The hazard of casting \"pearls  before swine\" caused our Master to refuse help to some  who sought his aid; and he left this precaution for  others.    _If mortal man is unreal, how can he be saved, and why_ [20]  _does he need to be saved? I ask for information, not for_  _controversy, for I am a seeker after Truth._    You will find the proper answer to this question in  my published works. Man is immortal. Mortal man  is a false concept that is not spared or prolonged by being [25]  saved from itself, from whatever is false. This salva-  tion means: saved from error, or error overcome. Im-  mortal man, in God's likeness, is safe in divine Science.  Mortal man is saved on this divine Principle, if he will  only avail himself of the efficacy of Truth, and recog- [30]    [Page 90.]    nize his Saviour. He must know that God is omnipo- [1]  tent; hence, that sin is impotent. He must know that  the power of sin is the pleasure in sin. Take away this  pleasure, and you remove all reality from its power. Jesus  demonstrated sin and death to be powerless. This [5]  practical Truth saves from sin, and will save all who  understand it.    _Is it wrong for a wife to have a husband treated for_  _sin, when she knows he is sinning, or for drinking and_  _smoking?_ [10]    It is always right to act rightly; but sometimes, under  circumstances exceptional, it is inexpedient to attack  evil. This rule is forever golden: \"As ye would that  men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" Do you  desire to be freed from sin? Then help others to be free; [15]  but in your measures, obey the Scriptures, \"Be ye wise  as serpents.\" Break the yoke of bondage in every wise  way. First, be sure that your means for doing good  are equal to your motives; then judge them by their  fruits. [20]    _If not ordained, shall the pastor of the Church of_  _Christ, Scientist, administer the communion,--and_  _shall members of a church not organized receive the_  _communion?_    Our great Master administered to his disciples the [25]  Passover, or last supper, without this prerogative being  conferred by a visible organization and ordained priest-  hood. His spiritually prepared breakfast, after his  resurrection, and after his disciples had left their nets  to follow him, is the spiritual communion which Chris- [30]    [Page 91.]    tian Scientists celebrate in commemoration of the Christ. [1]  This ordinance is significant as a type of the true worship,  and it should be observed at present in our churches.    It is not indispensable to organize materially Christ's  church. It is not absolutely necessary to ordain pas- [5]  tors and to dedicate churches; but if this be done,  let it be in concession to the period, and not as a per-  petual or indispensable ceremonial of the church. If  our church is organized, it is to meet the demand,  \"Suffer it to be so now.\" The real Christian compact [10]  is love for one another. This bond is wholly spiritual  and inviolate.    It is imperative, at all times and under every cir-  cumstance, to perpetuate no ceremonials except as  types of these mental conditions,--remembrance and [15]  love; a real affection for Jesus' character and example.  Be it remembered, that all types employed in the ser-  vice of Christian Science should represent the most spir-  itual forms of thought and worship that can be made  visible. [20]    _Should not the teacher of Christian Science have our_  _textbook, __\"__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,__\"_  _in his schoolroom and teach from it?_    I never dreamed, until informed thereof, that a loyal  student did not take his textbook with him into the class- [25]  room, ask questions from it, answer them according to  it, and, as occasion required, read from the book as au-  thority for what he taught. I supposed that students  had followed my example, and that of other teachers,  sufficiently to do this, and also to require their pupils to [30]  study the lessons before recitations.    [Page 92.]    To omit these important points is anomalous, con- [1]  sidering the necessity for understanding Science, and  the present liability of deviating from Christian Science.

During the years 1585-1586 they had conducted what they  considered marvellous works of exorcism in Catholic households of  Buckinghamshire and Middlesex.[1] Great efforts had been made to keep  news of these seances from reaching the ears of the government, but  accounts of them had gained wide circulation and came to the privy  council. That body was of course stimulated to greater activity against  the Catholics.[2]    As a phase of a suppressed form of religion the matter might never have  assumed any significance. Had not a third-rate Puritan clergyman, John  Darrel, almost by accident hit upon the use of exorcism, the story of  its use would be hardly worth telling.[3] When this young minister was  not more than twenty, but already, as he says, reckoned \"a man of hope,\"  he was asked to cure a seventeen-year-old girl at Mansfield in  Nottingham, Katherine Wright.[4] Her disease called for simple medical  treatment. That was not Darrel's plan of operation. She had an evil  spirit, he declared. From four o'clock in the morning until noon he  prayed over her spirit. He either set going of his own initiative the  opinion that possessed persons could point out witches, or he quickly  availed himself of such a belief already existing. The evil spirit, he  declared, could recognize and even name the witch that had sent it as  well as the witch's confederates. All of this was no doubt suggested to  the possessed girl and she was soon induced to name the witch that  troubled her. This was Margaret Roper, a woman with whom she was upon  bad terms. Margaret Roper was at once taken into custody by the  constable. She happened to be brought before a justice of the peace  possessing more than usual discrimination. He not only discharged  her,[5] but threatened John Darrel with arrest.[6]    This was in 1586. Darrel disappeared from view for ten years or so,  when he turned up at Burton-upon-Trent, not very far from the scene of  his first operations. Here he volunteered to cure Thomas Darling. The  story is a curious one and too long for repetition. Some facts must,  however, be presented in order to bring the story up to the point at  which Darrel intervened. Thomas Darling, a young Derbyshire boy, had  become ill after returning from a hunt. He was afflicted with  innumerable fits, in which he saw green angels and a green cat. His aunt  very properly consulted a physician, who at the second consultation  thought it possible that the child was bewitched. The aunt failed to  credit the diagnosis. The boy's fits continued and soon took on a  religious character. Between seizures he conversed with godly people.  They soon discovered that the reading of the Scriptures brought on  attacks. This looked very like the Devil's work. The suggestion of the  physician was more seriously regarded. Meanwhile the boy had overheard  the discussion of witchcraft and proceeded to relate a story. He had  met, he said, a \"little old woman\" in a \"gray gown with a black fringe  about the cape, a broad thrimmed hat, and three warts on her face.\"[7]  Very accidentally, as he claimed, he offended her. She angrily said a  rhyming charm that ended with the words, \"I wil goe to heaven, and thou  shalt goe to hell,\" and stooped to the ground.    The story produced a sensation. Those who heard it declared at once that  the woman must have been Elizabeth Wright, or her daughter Alse  Gooderidge, women long suspected of witchcraft. Alse was fetched to the  boy. She said she had never seen him, but her presence increased the  violence of his fits. Mother and daughter were carried before two  justices of the peace, who examined them together with Alse's husband  and daughter. The women were searched for special marks in the usual  revolting manner with the usual outcome, but only Alse herself was sent  to gaol.[8]    The boy grew no better. It was discovered that the reading of certain  verses in the first chapter of John invariably set him off.[9] The  justices of the peace put Alse through several examinations, but with  little result. Two good witches were consulted, but refused to help  unless the family of the bewitched came to see them.    Meantime a cunning man appeared who promised to prove Alse a witch. In  the presence of \"manie worshipfull personages\" \"he put a paire of new  shooes on her feete, setting her close to the fire till the shooes being  extreame hot might constrayne her through increase of the paine to  confesse.\" \"This,\" says the writer, \"was his ridiculous practice.\" The  woman \"being throghly heated desired a release\" and offered to confess,  but, as soon as her feet were cooled, refused. No doubt the justices of  the peace would have repudiated the statement that the illegal process  of torture was used. The methods of the cunning man were really nothing  else.    The woman was harried day and night by neighbors to bring her to  confess.[10] At length she gave way and, in a series of reluctant  confessions, told a crude story of her wrong-doings that bore some  slight resemblance to the boy's tale, and involved the use of a spirit  in the form of a dog.    Now it was that John Darrel came upon the ground eager to make a name  for himself. Darling had been ill for three months and was not  improving. Even yet some of the boy's relatives and friends doubted if  he were possessed. Not so Darrel. He at once undertook to pray and fast  for the boy. According to his own account his efforts were singularly  blessed. At all events the boy gradually improved and Darrel claimed the  credit. As for Alse Gooderidge, she was tried at the assizes, convicted  by the jury, and sentenced by Lord Chief-Justice Anderson to  imprisonment. She died soon after.[11] This affair undoubtedly widened  Darrel's reputation.    Not long after, a notable case of possession in Lancashire afforded him  a new opportunity to attract notice. The case of Nicholas Starchie's  children provoked so much comment at the time that it is perhaps worth  while to go back and bring the narrative up to the point where Darrel  entered.[12] Two of Starchie's children had one day been taken ill most  mysteriously, the girl \"with a dumpish and heavie countenance, and with  a certaine fearefull starting and pulling together of her body.\" The boy  was \"compelled to shout\" on the way to school. Both grew steadily  worse[13] and the father consulted Edmund Hartley, a noted conjurer of  his time. Hartley quieted the children by the use of charms. When he  realized that his services would be indispensable to the father he made  a pretence of leaving and so forced a promise from Starchie to pay him  40 shillings a year. This ruse was so successful that he raised his  demands. He asked for a house and lot, but was refused. The children  fell ill again. The perplexed parent now went to a physician of  Manchester. But the physician \"sawe no signe of sicknes.\" Dr. Dee, the  famous astrologer and friend of Elizabeth, was summoned. He advised the  help of \"godlie preachers.\"[14]    Meantime the situation in the afflicted family took a more serious turn.  Besides Mr. Starchie's children, three young wards of his, a servant,  and a visitor, were all taken with the mysterious illness. The modern  reader might suspect that some contagious disease had gripped the  family, but the irregular and intermittent character of the disease  precludes that hypothesis. Darrel in his own pamphlet on the matter  declares that when the parents on one occasion went to a play the  children were quiet, but that when they were engaged in godly exercise  they were tormented, a statement that raises a suspicion that the  disease, like that of the Throckmorton children, was largely imaginary.    But the divines were at work. They had questioned the conjurer, and had  found that he fumbled \"verie ill favouredlie\" in the repetition of the  Lord's Prayer. He was haled before a justice of the peace, who began  gathering evidence against him and turned him over to the assizes. There  it came out that he had been wont to kiss the Starchie children, and had  even attempted, although without success, to kiss a maid servant. In  this way he had presumably communicated the evil spirit--a new notion.  The court could find no law, however, upon which to hang him. He had  bewitched the children, but he had bewitched none of them to death, and  therefore had not incurred the death penalty. But the father leaped into  the gap. He remembered that he had seen the conjurer draw a magic circle  and divide it into four parts and that he had bidden the witness step  into the quarters one after another. Making such circles was definitely  mentioned in the law as felony. Hartley denied the charge, but to no  purpose. He was convicted of felony[15]--so far as we can judge, on this  unsupported afterthought of a single witness--and was hanged. Sympathy,  however, would be inappropriate. In the whole history of witchcraft  there were few victims who came so near to deserving their fate.    This was the story up to the time of Darrel's arrival. With Darrel came  his assistant, George More, pastor of a church in Derbyshire. The two at  once recognized the supernatural character of the case they were to  treat and began religious services for the stricken family. It was to no  effect. \"All or most of them joined together in a strange and  supernatural loud whupping that the house and grounde did sounde  therwith again.\"    But the exorcists were not by any means disheartened. On the following  day, in company with another minister, they renewed the services and  were able to expel six of the seven spirits. On the third day they  stormed and took the last citadel of Satan. Unhappily the capture was  not permanent. Darrel tells us himself that the woman later became a  Papist[16] and the evil spirit returned.    The exorcist now turned his skill upon a young apprenticed musician of  Nottingham. According to "]]]
