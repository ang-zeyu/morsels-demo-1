In the new form, called the  Reflecting Telescope, or \"Reflector,\" the light coming from the object  under observation was _reflected_ into the eye-piece from the surface of  a highly polished concave metallic mirror, or _speculum_, as it was  called. It is to Sir Isaac Newton that the world is indebted for the  reflecting telescope in its best form. That philosopher had set himself  to investigate the causes of the rainbow-like, or prismatic colours  which for a long time had been such a source of annoyance to telescopic  observers; and he pointed out that, as the colours were produced in the  passage of the rays of light _through_ the glass, they would be entirely  absent if the light were reflected from the _surface_ of a mirror  instead.    The reflecting telescope, however, had in turn certain drawbacks of its  own. A mirror, for instance, can plainly never be polished to such a  high degree as to reflect as much light as a piece of transparent glass  will let through. Further, the position of the eye-piece is by no means  so convenient. It cannot, of course, be pointed directly towards the  mirror, for the observer would then have to place his head right in the  way of the light coming from the celestial object, and would thus, of  course, cut it off. In order to obviate this difficulty, the following  device was employed by Newton in his telescope, of which he constructed  his first example in 1668. A small, flat mirror was fixed by thin wires  in the centre of the tube of the telescope, and near to its open end. It  was set slant-wise, so that it reflected the rays of light directly into  the eye-piece, which was screwed into a hole at the side of the tube  (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Newtonian\").    Although the Newtonian form of telescope had the immense advantage of  doing away with the prismatic colours, yet it wasted a great deal of  light; for the objection in this respect with regard to loss of light by  reflection from the large mirror applied, of course, to the small mirror  also. In addition, the position of the \"flat,\" as the small mirror is  called, had the further effect of excluding from the great mirror a  certain proportion of light. But the reflector had the advantage, on the  other hand, of costing less to make than the refractor, as it was not  necessary to procure flawless glass for the purpose. A disc of a certain  metallic composition, an alloy of copper and tin, known in consequence  as _speculum metal_, had merely to be cast; and this had to be ground  and polished _upon one side only_, whereas a lens has to be thus treated  _upon both its sides_. It was, therefore, possible to make a much larger  instrument at a great deal less labour and expense.    [Illustration: PLATE III. A TUBELESS, OR \"AERIAL\" TELESCOPE    From an illustration in the _Opera Varia_ of Christian Huyghens.    (Page 110)]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--The various types of Telescope. All the above  telescopes are _pointed_ in the same direction; that is to say, the rays  of light from the object are coming from the left-hand side.]    We have given the Newtonian form as an example of the principle of the  reflecting telescope. A somewhat similar instrument had, however, been  projected, though not actually constructed, by James Gregory a few years  earlier than Newton's, _i.e._ in 1663. In this form of reflector, known  as the \"Gregorian\" telescope, a hole was made in the big concave mirror;  and a small mirror, also concave, which faced it at a certain distance,  received the reflected rays, and reflected them back again through the  hole in question into the eye-piece, which was fixed just behind (see  Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Gregorian\"). The Gregorian had thus the sentimental  advantage of being _pointed directly at the object_. The hole in the big  mirror did not cause any loss of light, for the central portion in which  it was made was anyway unable to receive light through the small mirror  being directly in front of it. An adaptation of the Gregorian was the  \"Cassegrainian\" telescope, devised by Cassegrain in 1672, which differed  from it chiefly in the small mirror being convex instead of concave (see  Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Cassegrainian\"). These _direct-view_ forms of the  reflecting telescope were much in vogue about the middle of the  eighteenth century, when many beautiful examples of Gregorians were made  by the famous optician, James Short, of Edinburgh.    An adaptation of the Newtonian type of telescope is known as the  \"Herschelian,\" from being the kind favoured by Sir William Herschel. It  is, however, only suitable in immense instruments, such as Herschel was  in the habit of employing. In this form the object-glass is set at a  slight slant, so that the light coming from the object is reflected  straight into the eye-piece, which is fixed facing it in the side of the  tube (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Herschelian\"). This telescope has an  advantage over the other forms of reflector through the saving of light  consequent on doing away with the _second_ reflection. There is,  however, the objection that the slant of the object-glass is productive  of some distortion in the appearance of the object observed; but this  slant is of necessity slight when the length of the telescope is very  great.    The principle of this type of telescope had been described to the  French Academy of Sciences as early as 1728 by Le Maire, but no one  availed himself of the idea until 1776, when Herschel tried it. At  first, however, he rejected it; but in 1786 he seems to have found that  it suited the huge instruments which he was then making. Herschel's  largest telescope, constructed in 1789, was about four feet in diameter  and forty feet in length. It is generally spoken of as the \"Forty-foot  Telescope,\" though all other instruments have been known by their  _diameters_, rather than by their lengths.    To return to the refracting telescope. A solution of the colour  difficulty was arrived at in 1729 (two years after Newton's death) by an  Essex gentleman named Chester Moor Hall. He discovered that by making a  double object-glass, composed of an outer convex lens and an inner  concave lens, made respectively of different kinds of glass, _i.e._  _crown_ glass and _flint_ glass, the troublesome colour effects could  be, _to a very great extent_, removed. Hall's investigations appear to  have been rather of an academic nature; and, although he is believed to  have constructed a small telescope upon these lines, yet he seems to  have kept the matter so much to himself that it was not until the year  1758 that the first example of the new instrument was given to the  world. This was done by John Dollond, founder of the well-known optical  firm of Dollond, of Ludgate Hill, London, who had, quite independently,  re-discovered the principle.    This \"Achromatic\" telescope, or telescope \"free from colour effects,\" is  the kind ordinarily in use at present, whether for astronomical or for  terrestrial purposes (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Achromatic\"). The expense of  making large instruments of this type is very great, for, in the  object-glass alone, no less than _four_ surfaces have to be ground and  polished to the required curves; and, usually, the two lenses of which  it is composed have to fit quite close together.    With the object of evading the expense referred to, and of securing  _complete_ freedom from colour effects, telescopes have even been made,  the object-glasses of which were composed of various transparent liquids  placed between thin lenses; but leakages, and currents set up within  them by changes of temperature, have defeated the ingenuity of those who  devised these substitutes.    The solution of the colour difficulty by means of Dollond's achromatic  refractor has not, however, ousted the reflecting telescope in its best,  or Newtonian form, for which great concave mirrors made of glass,  covered with a thin coating of silver and highly polished, have been  used since about 1870 instead of metal mirrors. They are very much  lighter in weight and cheaper to make than the old specula; and though  the silvering, needless to say, deteriorates with time, it can be  renewed at a comparatively trifling cost. Also these mirrors reflect  much more light, and give a clearer view, than did the old metallic  ones.    When an object is viewed through the type of astronomical telescope  ordinarily in use, it is seen _upside down_. This is, however, a matter  of very small moment in dealing with celestial objects; for, as they are  usually round, it is really not of much consequence which part we regard  as top and which as bottom. Such an inversion would, of course, be most  inconvenient when viewing terrestrial objects. In order to observe the  latter we therefore employ what is called a terrestrial telescope, which  is merely a refractor with some extra lenses added in the eye portion  for the purpose of turning the inverted image the right way up again.  These extra lenses, needless to say, absorb a certain amount of light;  wherefore it is better in astronomical observation to save light by  doing away with them, and putting up with the slight inconvenience of  seeing the object inverted.    This inversion of images by the astronomical telescope must be specially  borne in mind with regard to the photographs of the moon in Chapter XVI.    In the year 1825 the largest achromatic refractor in existence was one  of nine and a half inches in diameter constructed by Fraunhofer for the  Observatory of Dorpat in Russia. The largest refractors in the world  to-day are in the United States, _i.e._ the forty-inch of the Yerkes  Observatory (see Plate IV., p. 118), and the thirty-six inch of the  Lick. The object-glasses of these and of the thirty-inch telescope of  the Observatory of Pulkowa, in Russia, were made by the great optical  house of Alvan Clark & Sons, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

Soon after this appeared a new star, the stella nova of 1604, not the  one Tycho had seen--that was in 1572--but the same that Kepler was so  much interested in.    Galileo gave a course of three lectures upon it to a great audience. At  the first the theatre was over-crowded, so he had to adjourn to a hall  holding 1000 persons. At the next he had to lecture in the open air.    He took occasion to rebuke his hearers for thronging to hear about an  ephemeral novelty, while for the much more wonderful and important  truths about the permanent stars and facts of nature they had but deaf  ears.    But the main point he brought out concerning the new star was that it  upset the received Aristotelian doctrine of the immutability of the  heavens. According to that doctrine the heavens were unchangeable,  perfect, subject neither to growth nor to decay. Here was a body, not a  meteor but a real distant star, which had not been visible and which  would shortly fade away again, but which meanwhile was brighter than  Jupiter.    The staff of petrified professorial wisdom were annoyed at the  appearance of the star, still more at Galileo's calling public attention  to it; and controversy began at Padua. However, he accepted it; and now  boldly threw down the gauntlet in favour of the Copernican theory,  utterly repudiating the old Ptolemaic system which up to that time he  had taught in the schools according to established custom.    The earth no longer the only world to which all else in the firmament  were obsequious attendants, but a mere insignificant speck among the  host of heaven! Man no longer the centre and cynosure of creation, but,  as it were, an insect crawling on the surface of this little speck! All  this not set down in crabbed Latin in dry folios for a few learned  monks, as in Copernicus's time, but promulgated and argued in rich  Italian, illustrated by analogy, by experiment, and with cultured wit;  taught not to a few scholars here and there in musty libraries, but  proclaimed in the vernacular to the whole populace with all the energy  and enthusiasm of a recent convert and a master of language! Had a  bombshell been exploded among the fossilized professors it had been less  disturbing.    But there was worse in store for them.    A Dutch optician, Hans Lippershey by name, of Middleburg, had in his  shop a curious toy, rigged up, it is said, by an apprentice, and made  out of a couple of spectacle lenses, whereby, if one looked through it,  the weather-cock of a neighbouring church spire was seen nearer and  upside down.    The tale goes that the Marquis Spinola, happening to call at the shop,  was struck with the toy and bought it. He showed it to Prince Maurice of  Nassau, who thought of using it for military reconnoitring. All this is  trivial. What is important is that some faint and inaccurate echo of  this news found its way to Padua, and into the ears of Galileo.    The seed fell on good soil. All that night he sat up and pondered. He  knew about lenses and magnifying glasses. He had read Kepler's theory of  the eye, and had himself lectured on optics. Could he not hit on the  device and make an instrument capable of bringing the heavenly bodies  nearer? Who knew what marvels he might not so perceive! By morning he  had some schemes ready to try, and one of them was successful.  Singularly enough it was not the same plan as the Dutch optician's, it  was another mode of achieving the same end.    He took an old small organ pipe, jammed a suitably chosen spectacle  glass into either end, one convex the other concave, and behold, he had  the half of a wretchedly bad opera glass capable of magnifying three  times. It was better than the Dutchman's, however; it did not invert.         It is easy to understand the general principle of a telescope. A       general knowledge of the common magnifying glass may be assumed.       Roger Bacon knew about lenses; and the ancients often refer to       them, though usually as burning glasses. The magnifying power of       globes of water must have been noticed soon after the discovery of       glass and the art of working it.         A magnifying glass is most simply thought of as an additional lens       to the eye. The eye has a lens by which ordinary vision is       accomplished, an extra glass lens strengthens it and enables       objects to be seen nearer and therefore apparently bigger. But to       apply a magnifying glass to distant objects is impossible. In order       to magnify distant objects, another function of lenses has also to       be employed, viz., their power of forming real images, the power on       which their use as burning-glasses depends: for the best focus is       an image of the sun. Although the object itself is inaccessible,       the image of it is by no means so, and to the image a magnifier can       be applied. This is exactly what is done in the telescope; the       object glass or large lens forms an image, which is then looked at       through a magnifying glass or eye-piece.         Of course the image is nothing like so big as the object. For       astronomical objects it is almost infinitely less; still it is an       exact representation at an accessible place, and no one expects a       telescope to show distant bodies as big as they really are. All it       does is to show them bigger than they could be seen without it.         But if the objects are not distant, the same principle may still be       applied, and two lenses may be used, one to form an image, the       other to magnify it; only if the object can be put where we please,       we can easily place it so that its image is already much bigger       than the object even before magnification by the eye lens. This is       the compound microscope, the invention of which soon followed the       telescope. In fact the two instruments shade off into one another,       so that the reading telescope or reading microscope of a laboratory       (for reading thermometers, and small divisions generally) goes by       either name at random.         The arrangement so far described depicts things on the retina the       unaccustomed way up. By using a concave glass instead of a convex,       and placing it so as to prevent any image being formed, except on       the retina direct, this inconvenience is avoided.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--View of the half-moon in small telescope. The  darker regions, or plains, used to be called \"seas.\"]    Such a thing as Galileo made may now be bought at a toy-shop for I  suppose half a crown, and yet what a potentiality lay in that \"glazed  optic tube,\" as Milton called it. Away he went with it to Venice and  showed it to the Signoria, to their great astonishment. \"Many noblemen  and senators,\" says Galileo, \"though of advanced age, mounted to the top  of one of the highest towers to watch the ships, which were visible  through my glass two hours before they were seen entering the harbour,  for it makes a thing fifty miles off as near and clear as if it were  only five.\" Among the people too the instrument excited the greatest  astonishment and interest, so that he was nearly mobbed. The Senate  hinted to him that a present of the instrument would not be  unacceptable, so Galileo took the hint and made another for them.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Portion of the lunar surface more highly  magnified, showing the shadows of a mountain range, deep pits, and other  details.]    They immediately doubled his salary at Padua, making it 1000 florins,  and confirmed him in the enjoyment of it for life.    He now eagerly began the construction of a larger and better instrument.  Grinding the lenses with his own hands with consummate skill, he  succeeded in making a telescope magnifying thirty times. Thus equipped  he was ready to begin a survey of the heavens.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Another portion of the lunar surface, showing a  so-called crater or vast lava pool and other evidences of ancient heat  unmodified by water.]    The first object he carefully examined was naturally the moon. He found  there everything at first sight very like the earth, mountains and  valleys, craters and plains, rocks, and apparently seas. You may imagine  the hostility excited among the Aristotelian philosophers, especially no  doubt those he had left behind at Pisa, on the ground of his spoiling  the pure, smooth, crystalline, celestial face of the moon as they had  thought it, and making it harsh and rugged and like so vile and ignoble  a body as the earth.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Lunar landscape showing earth. The earth would  be a stationary object in the moon's sky: its only apparent motion being  a slow oscillation as of a pendulum (the result of the moon's  libration).]    He went further, however, into heterodoxy than this--he not only made  the moon like the earth, but he made the earth shine like the moon. The  visibility of \"the old moon in the new moon's arms\" he explained by  earth-shine. Leonardo had given the same explanation a century before.  Now one of the many stock arguments against Copernican theory of the  earth being a planet like the rest was that the earth was dull and dark  and did not shine. Galileo argued that it shone just as much as the moon  does, and in fact rather more--especially if it be covered with clouds.  One reason of the peculiar brilliancy of Venus is that she is a very  cloudy planet.[8] Seen from the moon the earth would look exactly as the  moon does to us, only a little brighter and sixteen times as big (four  times the diameter).
