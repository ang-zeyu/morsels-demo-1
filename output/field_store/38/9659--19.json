Haying was once the hardest work on the farm, and in no crop has  machinery been more efficient. The basic idea in the reaper, the  cutter-bar, is the whole of the mower, and the machine developed with  the reaper. Previously Jeremiah Bailey, of Chester County, Pennsylvania,  had patented in 1822 a machine drawn by horses carrying a revolving  wheel with six scythes, which was widely used. The inventions of  Manning, Hussey, and McCormick made the mower practicable. Hazard  Knowles, an employee of the Patent Office, invented the hinged  cutter-bar, which could be lifted over an obstruction, but never  patented the invention. William F. Ketchum of Buffalo, New York, in  1844, patented the first machine intended to cut hay only, and dozens of  others followed. The modern mowing machine was practically developed in  the patent of Lewis Miller of Canton, Ohio, in 1858. Several times as  many mowers as harvesters are sold, and for that matter, reapers without  binding attachments are still manufactured.    Hayrakes and tedders seem to have developed almost of themselves.  Diligent research has failed to discover any reliable information on the  invention of the hayrake, though a horserake was patented as early as  1818. Joab Center of Hudson, New York, patented a machine for turning  and spreading hay in 1834. Mechanical hayloaders have greatly  reduced the amount of human labor. The hay-press makes storage and  transportation easier and cheaper.    There are binders which cut and bind corn. An addition shocks the corn  and deposits it upon the ground. The shredder and husker removes the  ears, husks them, and shreds shucks, stalks, and fodder. Power shellers  separate grain and cobs more than a hundred times as rapidly as a pair  of human hands could do. One student of agriculture has estimated that  it would require the whole agricultural population of the United States  one hundred days to shell the average corn crop by hand, but this is an  exaggeration.    The list of labor-saving machinery in agriculture is by no means  exhausted. There are clover hullers, bean and pea threshers, ensilage  cutters, manure spreaders, and dozens of others. On the dairy farm the  cream separator both increases the quantity and improves the quality of  the butter and saves time. Power also drives the churns. On many farms  cows are milked and sheep are sheared by machines and eggs are hatched  without hens.    There are, of course, thousands of farms in the country where machinery  cannot be used to advantage and where the work is still done entirely or  in part in the old ways.      Historians once were fond of marking off the story of the earth and of  men upon the earth into distinct periods fixed by definite dates. One  who attempts to look beneath the surface cannot accept this easy method  of treatment. Beneath the surface new tendencies develop long before  they demand recognition; an institution may be decaying long before its  weakness is apparent. The American Revolution began not with the Stamp  Act but at least a century earlier, as soon as the settlers realized  that there were three thousand miles of sea between England and the rude  country in which they found themselves; the Civil War began, if not  in early Virginia, with the \"Dutch Man of Warre that sold us twenty  Negars,\" at least with Eli Whitney and his cotton gin.    Nevertheless, certain dates or short periods seem to be flowering times.  Apparently all at once a flood of invention, a change of methods, a  difference in organization, or a new psychology manifests itself. And  the decade of the Civil War does serve as a landmark to mark the passing  of one period in American life and the beginning of another; especially  in agriculture; and as agriculture is the basic industry of the country  it follows that with its mutations the whole superstructure is also  changed.    The United States which fought the Civil War was vastly different  from the United States which fronted the world at the close of  the Revolution. The scant four million people of 1790 had grown to  thirty-one and a half million. This growth had come chiefly by natural  increase, but also by immigration, conquest, and annexation. Settlement  had reached the Pacific Ocean, though there were great stretches of  almost uninhabited territory between the settlements on the Pacific and  those just beyond the Mississippi.    The cotton gin had turned the whole South toward the cultivation of  cotton, though some States were better fitted for mixed farming, and  their devotion to cotton meant loss in the end as subsequent events have  proved. The South was not manufacturing any considerable proportion  of the cotton it grew, but the textile industry was flourishing in  New England. A whole series of machines similar to those used in Great  Britain, but not identical, had been invented in America. American mills  paid higher wages than British and in quantity production were far ahead  of the British mills, in proportion to hands employed, which meant being  ahead of the rest of the world.    Wages in America, measured by the world standard, were high, though  as expressed in money, they seem low now. They were conditioned by the  supply of free land, or land that was practically free. The wages paid  were necessarily high enough to attract laborers from the soil which  they might easily own if they chose. There was no fixed laboring class.  The boy or girl in a textile mill often worked only a few years to save  money, buy a farm, or to enter some business or profession.    The steamboat now, wherever there was navigable water, and the railroad,  for a large part of the way, offered transportation to the boundless  West. Steamboats traversed all the larger rivers and the lakes. The  railroad was growing rapidly. Its lines had extended to more than  thirty thousand miles. Construction went on during the war, and the  transcontinental railway was in sight. The locomotive had approached  standardization, and the American railway car was in form similar to  that of the present day, though not so large, so comfortable, or so  strong. The Pullman car, from which has developed the chair car, the  dining car, and the whole list of special cars, was in process of  development, and the automatic air brake of George Westinghouse was soon  to follow.    Thus far had the nation progressed in invention and industry along the  lines of peaceful development. But with the Civil War came a sudden and  tremendous advance. No result of the Civil War, political or social, has  more profoundly affected American life than the application to the farm,  as a war necessity, of machinery on a great scale. So long as labor  was plentiful and cheap, only a comparatively few farmers could be  interested in expensive machinery, but when the war called the young  men away the worried farmers gladly turned to the new machines and  found that they were able not only to feed the Union, but also to export  immense quantities of wheat to Europe, even during the war. Suddenly the  West leaped into great prosperity. And long centuries of economic and  social development were spanned within a few decades.        CHAPTER VI. AGENTS OF COMMUNICATION    Communication is one of man's primal needs. There was indeed a time when  no formula of language existed, when men communicated with each other by  means of gestures, grimaces, guttural sounds, or rude images of things  seen; but it is impossible to conceive of a time when men had no means  of communication at all. And at last, after long ages, men evolved in  sound the names of the things they knew and the forms of speech; ages  later, the alphabet and the art of writing; ages later still, those  wonderful instruments of extension for the written and spoken word: the  telegraph, the telephone, the modern printing press, the phonograph, the  typewriter, and the camera.    The word \"telegraph\" is derived from Greek and means \"to write far\"; so  it is a very exact word, for to write far is precisely what we do when  we send a telegram. The word today, used as a noun, denotes the system  of wires with stations and operators and messengers, girdling the earth  and reaching into every civilized community, whereby news is carried  swiftly by electricity. But the word was coined long before it was  discovered that intelligence could be communicated by electricity. It  denoted at first a system of semaphores, or tall poles with movable  arms, and other signaling apparatus, set within sight of one another.  There was such a telegraph line between Dover and London at the time  of Waterloo; and this telegraph began relating the news of the battle,  which had come to Dover by ship, to anxious London, when a fog set in  and the Londoners had to wait until a courier on horseback arrived. And,  in the very years when the real telegraph was coming into being,  the United States Government, without a thought of electricity, was  considering the advisability of setting up such a system of telegraphs  in the United States.    The telegraph is one of America's gifts to the world. The honor for this  invention falls to Samuel Finley Breese Morse, a New Englander of old  Puritan stock. Nor is the glory that belongs to Morse in any way dimmed  by the fact that he made use of the discoveries of other men who had  been trying to unlock the secrets of electricity ever since Franklin's  experiments. If Morse discovered no new principle, he is nevertheless  the man of all the workers in electricity between his own day and  Franklin's whom the world most delights to honor; and rightly so, for it  is to such as Morse that the world is most indebted. Others knew; Morse  saw and acted. Others had found out the facts, but Morse was the first  to perceive the practical significance of those facts; the first to take  steps to make them of service to his fellows; the first man of them all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#16)"],[1,"er, he asked him \"What was the oldest of all  things?\" The father replied, after the Socratic manner, \"And what do you  suppose is the oldest of all things?\" The boy was not successful in his  answers, whereon the old astronomer took up a small stone from the  garden walk: \"There, my child, there is the oldest of all the things  that I certainly know.\" On another occasion the father asked his son,  \"What sort of things do you think are most alike?\" The boy replied,  \"The leaves of the same tree are most like each other.\" \"Gather, then,  a handful of leaves from that tree,\" rejoined the philosopher,  \"and choose two which are alike.\"--_Monthly Notices Royal Astronomical  Society_, vol. xxxii., page 123.

[23] \"Of late years these expectations have been more than  accomplished by the discovery of no fewer than four planetary bodies,  almost all in the same place; but so small that Dr. HERSCHEL refuses to  honor them with the name of planets, and chooses to call them asteroids,  though for what reason it is not easy to determine, unless it be to  deprive the discoverers of these bodies of any pretence for rating  themselves as high in the list of astronomical discoverers as  himself.\"--_History of the Royal Society_, by THOMAS THOMSON, p. 358.  This work was published in 1812, and therefore during the lifetime of  HERSCHEL.    [24] _Poetical History of Astronomy_: this work was nearly  completed, but was never published. The whole of it was read to  HERSCHEL, in order that BURNEY might have the benefit of his criticism  on its technical terms.    [25] _Memoirs of Dr. BURNEY_, vol. iii., p. 264.

It is not necessary to say here how nobly Sir JOHN HERSCHEL redeemed the  trust confided in him. All the world knows of his Survey of the Southern  Heavens, in which he completed the review of the sky which had been  begun and completed for the northern heavens by the same instruments in  his father's hands. A glance at the Bibliography at the end of this book  will show the titles of several papers by Sir JOHN, written with the  sole object of rendering his father's labors more complete.

In this chapter I shall endeavor to give such explanations as will  enable the general reader to follow the course of discovery in each  branch of astronomy and physics, regularly through the period of  HERSCHEL'S life, and up to the state in which he left it.    A more detailed and precise account, which should appeal directly to the  professional astronomer, will not be needed, since ARAGO has already  fulfilled this want in his \"_Analyse de la vie et des travaux de Sir  WILLIAM HERSCHEL_,\" published in 1842. The few misconceptions there  contained will be easily corrected by those to whom alone they are of  consequence. The latter class of readers may also consult the abstracts  of HERSCHEL'S memoirs, which have been given in \"_A Subject-index and a  Synopsis of the Scientific Writings of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL_,\" prepared  by Dr. HASTINGS and myself, and published by the Smithsonian  Institution.    An accurate sketch of the state of astronomy in England and on the  Continent, in the years 1780-1820, need not be given. It will be enough  if we remember that of the chief observatories of Europe, public and  private, no one was actively devoted to such labors as were undertaken  by HERSCHEL at the very beginning of his career.    His observations on variable stars, indeed, were in the same line as  those of PIGOTT; FLAUGERGUES and DARQUIER, in France, had perhaps  preceded him in minute scrutiny of the sun's surface, etc.; but, even in  that department of observation, he at once put an immense distance  between himself and others by the rapid and extraordinary advances in  the size and in the excellence of his telescopes. Before his time the  principal aids to observation were the Gregorian and Newtonian  telescopes of SHORT, and the small achromatics of DOLLOND.[31]    We have seen, in what goes before, how his patient zeal had succeeded in  improving upon these. There was no delay, and no rest. Steadily the art  of making reflectors was urged forward, until he had finally in his  hands the forty-foot telescope.    It must be admitted that this was the limit to which the manufacture of  powerful telescopes could be pushed in his generation. The optical and  mechanical difficulties which prevented a farther advance required time  for their solution; and, indeed, some of these difficulties are scarcely  solved at this day. It may fairly be said that no reflector larger than  three feet in aperture has yet realized our expectations.                 _The Improvement of Telescopes and Optical Apparatus._    It will be of interest to give in this place some connected account of  the large forty-foot reflector, of four feet aperture, made by HERSCHEL.  Its history extends from 1785 to 1811. Its manufacture was considered by  his cotemporaries as his greatest triumph. As a machine, it was  extremely ingenious in all its parts, as may be seen from the elaborate  description and plates of it published in the _Philosophical  Transactions_ for 1795. One of its mirrors certainly had good  definition, for, by means of it, the two small satellites of _Saturn_  (_Mimas_ and _Enceladus_) were discovered, and these discoveries alone  would make it famous. Perhaps more was expected of it by the public in  general than it absolutely performed. Its merits were after a while  decried, and HERSCHEL even felt obliged to state why he did not always  employ it in his observations. His reasons were perfectly valid, and  such as any one may understand. The time required to get so large a  machine into working order was a serious tax; it required more  assistants than his twenty-foot telescope, and he says, \"I have made it  a rule never to employ a larger telescope when a smaller will answer the  purpose.\"    It still remains as a remarkable feat of engineering and an example of  great optical and mechanical skill. It led the way to the large  reflectors of Lord ROSSE, some sixty years later, and several of the  forty-foot telescopes of the present day even have done less useful  work. Its great feat, however, was to have added two satellites to the  solar system. From the published accounts of it the following is taken:        \"When I resided at Bath I had long been acquainted with the theory      of optics and mechanics, and wanted only that experience so      necessary in the practical part of these sciences. This I acquired      by degrees at that place, where in my leisure hours, by way of      amusement, I made several two-foot, five-foot, seven-foot, ten-foot,      and twenty-foot Newtonian telescopes, beside others, of the      Gregorian form, of eight, twelve, and eighteen inches, and two,      three, five, and ten feet focal length. In this way I made not less      than two hundred seven-foot, one hundred and fifty ten-foot, and      about eighty twenty-foot mirrors, not to mention the Gregorian      telescopes.[32]        \"The number of stands I invented for these telescopes it would not      be easy to assign. . . . In 1781 I began to construct a thirty-foot      aerial reflector, and having made a stand for it, I cast the mirror      thirty-six inches in diameter. This was cracked in cooling. I cast      it a second time, and the furnace I had built in my house broke.\"    Soon after, the Georgian planet was discovered, and this interrupted the  work for a time.        \"In the year 1783 I finished a very good twenty-foot reflector with      a large aperture, and mounted it upon the plan of my present      telescope. After two years' observation with it, the great advantage      of such apertures appeared so clearly to me that I recurred to my      former intention of increasing them still further; and being now      sufficiently provided with experience in the work which I wished to      undertake, the President of the Royal Society, who is always ready      to promote useful undertakings, had the goodness to lay my design      before the king. His Majesty was graciously pleased to approve of      it, and with his usual liberality to support it with his royal      bounty.        \"In consequence of this arrangement I began to construct the      forty-foot telescope about the latter end of 1785.[33] The woodwork      of the stand and machines for giving the required motions to the      instrument were immediately put in hand. In the whole of the      apparatus none but common workmen were employed, for I made drawings      of every part of it, by which it was easy to execute the work,"]]]
