In this  case it relieved Bell of all future responsibility.    He yawned, tapping his lips with the back of his hand, signaled for a  stop of the car, and got out. Five minutes later he had signaled a  taxicab and given Ribiera's address. In six minutes he was being  whirled toward the one house in all Rio de Janeiro from which his  chance of a safe departure was slightest. In little more than half an  hour he had dismissed the cab and was gazing placidly into the  startled eyes of the doorman. The doorman, like all of Rio where  Ribiera was known and feared, knew that Bell was being hunted.    Bell handed over his card with an inscrutable air.    \"The Senhor Ribiera,\" he said drily, \"returned to the city last night.  Present my card and say that I would like to speak to him.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The doorman ushered him inside and summoned the major-domo, still  blinking his amazement. And the major-domo blinked again. But Bell  followed with the air of an habitue, as he was again ushered into the  luxurious salon in which he had once been offered a drugged drink.    Again he sank down in a softly padded chair and surveyed the pictures  and the minor objects of decadent art about him. Again he lighted a  cigarette with every appearance of ease, and again had the impression  of eyes upon him. The major-domo appeared, somewhat agitated.    \"The Senhor Ribiera,\" he said harshly, \"will see you only if you are  not armed. He requires your word of honor.\"    Bell smiled lazily.    \"I'll do better than that,\" he said languidly. \"I haven't had time to  buy a revolver. But the automatic he had put out of commission is in  my pocket. Present it to him with my compliments.\"    He handed over the weapon, butt first. The major-domo blinked, and  took it. Bell sat down and smiled widely. He had been expected to be  uproarious, to attempt to force the major-domo to lead him to Ribiera.  And, of course, he would have been led past a perfectly planned ambush  for his capture--but he might have killed the major-domo. Which would  not disturb Ribiera, but had disturbed the servant.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell smoked comfortably. And suddenly hangings parted, and Ribiera  came into the room. He smiled nervously, and then, as Bell blew a puff  of smoke at him and nodded casually, he scowled.    \"I came,\" said Bell deliberately, \"to make a bargain. Frankly, I do  not like to break my word. I was under obligations to deliver a  package from Senhor Canalejas to a certain messenger who will take it  to my government. I have done it. But I am not, Senhor Ribiera, a  member of the Secret Service. I am entirely a free agent now, and I am  prepared to consider your proposals, which I could not in honor do  before.\"    He smiled pleasantly. Effrontery, properly managed, is one of the most  valuable of all qualities. Especially in dealing with people who  themselves are arrogant when they dare.           *       *       *       *       *    Ribiera purpled with rage, and then controlled it.    \"Ah!\" he rumbled. \"You are prepared to consider my proposals. There  are no proposals. The Master may be amused at your cleverness in  escaping. I do not know. I do know that I am ordered to make you my  slave and send you to The Master. That, I shall do.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Bell blandly: \"but I can go without food and drink for  several days, which will delay the process. And while I cannot  honorably tell you how to stop the man bearing Senhor Canalejas'  package to my government, still ... If I willingly accepted a dose of  _yague_ in token of my loyalty to The Master....\"    Ribiera's good humor returned. He chuckled.    \"You actually mean,\" he said jovially, \"that you think you were given  some of The Master's little compound, and that you wish to make terms  before your hands begin to writhe at the ends of your wrists. Is not  that your reason?\"    Bell's eyes flickered. He had been horribly afraid of just that. But  Ribiera's amusement was reassuring.    \"Perhaps,\" said Bell. \"Perhaps I am.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ribiera sat down and stretched his fat legs in front of him. He  surveyed Bell with an obscene, horrible amusement.    \"Ah, Senhor,\" he chuckled, \"some day we will laugh together over this!  You yet hope, and do not yet know how much better it will be for you  if you cease to hope, and cultivate desires! The Master is pleased  with you. You have just those qualities he knows are necessary in  dealing with your nation. He is not angry with you. It is his  intention to use you to extend his--ah--influence among the officials  of your nation. You know, of course, that in but a little more time I  will hold all Brazil--as I now hold this city--in the hollow of my  hand. Four of the republics of this continent are already completely  under the control of The Master's deputies, and of the rest, Brazil is  not the most nearly subdued. A year or two, and The Master will  become Emperor, and his deputies viceroys. And it is his whim to give  you the opportunity of becoming the first deputy and the first viceroy  of North America. And you come to me and offer--you, Senhor!--to make  terms! I believe even The Master will laugh when he hears of it.\"    \"But,\" said Bell practically, \"do you accept my terms?\"    Ribiera chuckled again.    \"What are they, Senhor?\"    \"That you release the daughter of the Senhor Canalejas and pledge your  word of honor that she will not be enslaved.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ribiera's word of honor, of course, would be worth rather less than  the breath that was used to give it. But his reception of the proposal  would be informative.    He chuckled again.    \"No, Senhor. I do not accept. But I will promise you as a favor,  because my uncle The Master admires you, that within a few weeks you  shall enjoy her charms. I do not,\" he added with amused candor, \"find  that any one woman diverts me for a very long time.\"    \"Oh,\" said Bell, very quietly.    He sat still for an instant, and then shrugged, and looked about as if  for an ash tray in which to knock the ashes from his cigarette. He  stood up, carrying the tube of tobacco gingerly, and moved toward one  by Ribiera's elbow. He knocked off the ash, and crushed out the tiny  coal. He fumbled in his pockets.    The next instant Ribiera choked with terror.    \"Let me explain,\" said Bell softly. \"I did not give your major-domo my  word that I was unarmed. I merely gave him a weapon. I got these from  two policemen who tried to arrest me an hour or so ago. And I also  remind you, Senhor, that if the armed men you have posted to prevent  my escape try to shoot me, that the inevitable contraction of my  muscles will send two bullets into your heart--even if I am dead. I  am a dead man, Senhor, if you give the word, but so are you if you  give it.\"    Ribiera gasped. His eyes rolled in his head.    \"Send for her,\" said Bell very gently. \"Send for her, Senhor. I  estimate that she has been in this house for less than half an hour.  Have her brought here at once, and if she has been harmed the three of  us will perish very promptly, and half of Rio will go mad after our  death.\"    And the muzzles of two revolvers bored into the fat flesh of Ribiera's  body, and a gasp that was almost a wail of terror came from the  watchers--armed watchers--who dared not kill the man they had been  posted to guard Ribiera against.    Ribiera lifted his hand and croaked an order.

I, Gregg Haljan, was third officer.    It was destined to be a tragic voyage. For in our midst were  unscrupulous brigands, masquerading as harmless passengers, intent on  seizing the secret treasure of radium ore Johnny Grantline of the  Grantline Expedition had dug from the Moon. The _Planetara_ was to  stop on the Moon and pick the treasure up on her return trip from  Mars.    Miko, a giant Martian, and his sister, Moa, were the ringleaders. With  them were, as passengers, Sir Arthur Coniston and Ob Hahn, a Venus  mystic. The whole crew was in their pay.    Miko struck. The captain was killed, as were the officers. Only Snap  Dean, the radio-helio operator, Venza, a girl of Venus, and I were  left. And, of course, Anita Prince, who had captivated my heart upon  my first glimpse of her.    The brigands abandoned the other passengers on a small asteroid, and  Miko signaled his space-ship far off on Mars to meet him on the Moon.  I was forced to guide the _Planetara_ to the Moon. We sighted the huts  of the Grantline Expedition, and suddenly, just as we started to  descend, the controls, snapped, and the _Planetara_ tumbled like a  spent rocket! Desperately I tried to check her, but only partially  succeeded. We crashed horribly against the barren gray rock of the  Moon. Anita, Venza, Snap and I lived through it, but we could not find  the bodies of Miko and Moa in the wreckage. Evidently they were still  alive, somewhere.    We reached Johnny Grantline. The _Planetara_ was a complete wreck.  And, speeding to us from Mars, was Miko's brigand ship.    We were powerless--without means of leaving the Moon--and completely  at the mercy of Miko's fast approaching brigands!      CHAPTER XXIII    _The Prowling Watchman_    \"Try it again,\" Snap urged. \"Good God, Johnny, we've got to raise some  Earth station! Chance it! Use your power--run it up to the full.

During the night  the mules had not failed to leave here and there the relics of their  digestion. The aroma, borne on the morning breeze, had struck the  Scarabaeus on awaking. It was his favourite dish. From all points of  the sky their heavy silhouettes could be seen against the blue. It was  still fresh, the sun having only risen about an hour before; the heat  would soon become oppressive, and the sybaritic beetle, without  attending to his morning appetite, which his fresh meal could not fail  to excite, nourishes the bourgeois dream of making his little pile in  order to enjoy himself sheltered from the hot rays. Immediately on  arriving on the scene of the accident each began to display feverish  activity. All set to work. With their heads, the anterior edge of  which is flat and supplied with six strong spines, they raised their  provisions; with their anterior feet, which are large and also armed  with spines, they moulded the paste and placed it beneath the abdomen  between the four other legs, giving it a rounded form. Little by  little the sphere increased and acquired the size of a small apple.  That was sufficiently large, and besides it was already becoming hot.  The insect set about carting away his prize to a sheltered  dining-room. He placed his four posterior legs on the ball; with the  two last, which were continually moving, he made certain of the  equilibrium of the mass; then resting his head and two anterior feet  on the ground he pushed backwards, and with extreme rapidity. (Fig.  14.) There was enough for all; each worker could find the just reward  for his labour; I witnessed none of the regrettable facts narrated by  Fabre. It happens sometimes, according to this ingenious observer,  that a cunning Scarabaeus, who has taken no part in the laborious  labour of moulding the paste, arrives when it is on the road to aid  the convoy, or even simply to pretend to help, in order that when the  moment has come he may claim a share in the coveted meal, or even  carry it all away if he can profit by a momentary inattention on the  part of the lawful proprietor. I followed one of these Coleoptera for  more than five metres from the place where his labour began. After  having deposited his ball he began to dig up the earth around it;[55]  but the mules had returned and I was obliged to depart.       [54] J. H. Fabre, _Souvenirs entomologiques_, 1879.       [55] In captivity also, as Mrs. Brightwen found, the          Scarabaeus always attempts to bury its ball in the earth.    I have no doubt that subsequent events were not exactly the same as  narrated by Fabre for the Scarabaeus of Provence. The insect having  made his hole, buries himself in it for a _tete a tete_ with the  precious sphere. He immediately sets about passing the whole through  his body. Without haste but without rest, for a week or a fortnight,  as long as there is any of it left, he eats continuously, and  continuously digests. He does not stop for a moment, his jaws are  working the whole time; and Fabre has called attention to the fact  that from the opposite extremity of the animal a continuous thread  emerges without breaking, and becomes coiled up.    _Care bestowed on harvested provisions._--Among the animals who take  particular care of the provisions they have amassed, special mention  must be made of certain species of Ants. It was formerly believed that  these industrious Hymenoptera are not accustomed to store up in barns  for the winter. This opinion long prevailed owing to the authority of  Huber, so competent in these matters, although the ancients were well  acquainted with the storehouses of ants.[56] But it was founded on an  exclusive study of these insects in northern countries, in which,  during the cold season, they become torpid and buried in their  hybernal sleep. Naturally they have no need of food during this  period, but it was incorrect to generalise from this fact. The ants of  the south are active all the year round. An English naturalist,  Moggridge, who passed several winters at Mentone, has placed this fact  out of doubt. Suffering from an incurable disease, he occupied the  last years of his life in observing and setting down for the  instruction of others the habits of these insects. He found that ants  of the species _Atta barbara_ store up grains. They utilise plants of  various kinds, but usually fumitory, oats, nettle, various species of  _Veronica_, etc. They procure these grains towards the end of autumn,  collecting them on the soil, or even, when they do not fall in  sufficient quantities, climbing up the plants and gathering them in  position. An ant will, for instance, ascend the stem of a fruiting  plant, of shepherd's-purse, let us say, and select a well-filled but  green pod, mid-way up the stem, those below being ready to shed their  seeds at a touch. Then seizing it in its jaws, and fixing its hind  legs firmly as a pivot, it contrives to turn round and round, and so  to strain the fibres of the fruit-stalk until they snap; it then  patiently backs down the stem. Sometimes two ants combine their  efforts; one, at the base of the peduncle, gnaws at the point of  greatest tension, while the other hauls upon it and twists it. And  sometimes the ants drop the capsules to their companions below,  corresponding with the curious account given by AElian of the way the  spikelets of corn are thrown down \"to the people below.\" In this  labour they display the activity usual in their race, and do not stop  until they have carried away to their barns the amount of provision  they desire. When their wealth is stored up in the nest, the ants pile  up the grains in some hundred little rooms designed for this purpose,  each measuring from seven to eight centimetres in diameter, and three  or four in height; the average granary being about the size of a  gentleman's gold watch. Adding up the quantities of grain divided  between these different barns, it is found that they may be estimated  at about 500 or 600 grammes, which represents a very large number of  meals for such small appetites, and must cost colossal labour if we  take into consideration the size of the workers. But when the harvest  is completed, the _Atta barbara_ have not completed their task; they  are too ingenious to limit themselves to waiting with crossed legs for  the moment to come when they may enjoy their labour, without  considering the damage that may arise. Their first care is to prevent  the grains from germinating for some weeks. How they obtain this  result is not exactly known, but it is certain that germination does  not take place, although all the conditions of heat and moisture  offered by the interior of the ant-hill are favourable to it; it is  not less certain that this arrest is due to the ants. This is shown in  a very simple manner. It is sufficient to prevent the access of the  insects to one of these chambers to cause the grains to germinate  immediately. We can only suppose some direct action of the ants, every  other hypothesis falling before this single fact: the arrested  phenomenon is produced as soon as the _Atta barbara_ no longer acts on  it. Therefore they arrest germination without rendering it impossible,  and when the moment arrives for utilising the accumulated stores,  their first care is to allow the grains to follow the normal course of  evolution. The envelope breaks, the little plant makes its appearance;  radicle and stalk come to light. But the ants do not permit the  development to go too far. The little plant, in order to grow, digests  the starch which is associated with the albumen, for it is not yet  able to draw its nourishment direct from the soil. To be absorbed and  assimilated this starch must first be transformed into sugar. This  chemical transformation being effected, the grain is in the condition  in which the ants prefer it. Like a wine-grower who watches over the  fermentation in his vat, and stops it before the wine turns sour, they  stop the digestion of the starch at this stage. If we do not know how  they retard germination, we know at all events how they render it  impossible at this later stage. It is the young plant which absorbs  the glucose, and which must therefore be destroyed; they cut off the  radicle with their mandibles, and gnaw the stalk; the germ is thus  suppressed. They have not yet finished their manipulations, which must  enable them to preserve without further alteration the provisions  which they have already rendered palatable. They bring out all their  provisions to the sun, dry them, and take them back to the barns. As  long as winter lasts they feed on this sweet flour. An anatomical  peculiarity enables them to make the most of it; their mouth is so  arranged that they can absorb solid particles and eat the albuminous  powder. In this they differ from their northern kin, who are obliged  to feed exclusively on juices.       [56] See chapter on \"The Ancient Belief in Harvesting Ants,\"          in McCook's _Agricultural Ants_.    I have compared the labours of these ants to those of the wine-grower.  Both of them in fact utilise the chemical phenomena going on in living  matter; both of them know how at a given moment to prevent the  transformation from going further. Neither of them for the rest take  into account the part played by diastasis and ferments. The ancestors  of one as of the other have by chance found out the method, and they  transmit it from generation to generation.[57]       [57] J.

It is called the  _Pogonomyrmex barbatus_, or, on account of its customs, the  Agricultural Ant. It"]]]
