Length of transepts, 248 feet. Breadth of nave, 123; of  transept and choir a trifle less; of west front with chapels, 179.  Height, to summit of balustrade, 108; to apex of roof, 120; to stone  gallery, 182; to base of sphere, 220; to upper gallery at the summit  of the dome, 281; to the summit of the cross, 363 feet.    The material is from the quarries of Portland, chosen because of its  durability in regard to both weather and smoke, the facilities for  transport, and the size of the blocks. Had Roche Abbey stone from  South Yorkshire been more easily obtainable, these quarries might have  been used as well. The size of the blocks contributes an important  feature to the architecture, where so much depends upon the breadth of  four feet; and even the procuring of this, as time went on, and the  stonecutters had to work at a greater distance from the sea, became a  matter of delay and difficulty, and the masons might have to wait  months for their blocks.    The combination of the stability with such lightness and gracefulness  as were procurable, can in a measure be estimated by the comparative  area taken up by the walls, pillars, and other points of support. This  area amounts to seventeen per cent., and compares favourably with St.  Peter's at Rome, which is more than half as much again, as well as  with St. Sophia and the Duomo at Florence. On the other hand many of  our Gothic cathedrals require only ten per cent.[70] Wren would have  said that they lack stability, and that he had calculated accurately  on the minimum of massiveness requisite for security; and besides  this, they have no heavy dome to be poised. Throughout there are two  stages or stories. The lower has the Corinthian Order, which was  always Wren's favourite, as he held that it was at once more graceful  and bore a greater weight of entablature than the earlier Doric and  Ionic. Wren's first design of a Greek Cross followed St. Peter's in  consisting of one main order plus an attic.[71] While Bramante at St.  Peter's found stones of nine feet in diameter in the quarries of  Tivoli, Wren, after making inquiries all over, could not procure  sufficient stone for his columns and pilasters of a greater diameter  than four feet, and he would not depart, at least to any degree, from  what he held to be the correct Corinthian height of nine diameters.  Had a sufficient quantity of larger blocks been obtainable, we should  have had the Corinthian order plus the attic, instead of the two  regular orders of Corinthian and Composite.[72] And this, it seems,  was his reason for departing in this respect from the First Design;  as also partially from the Approved Design. The pilasters are grouped  in pairs throughout, not only for stability, but also for sufficient  space for the circular-headed windows ornamented with festoons. Above  the entablature rises the second stage or story, or order. Here the  coupled pilasters have that slight difference in base and more  particularly in capital which constitutes the Composite order. The  capitals have the larger scrolls or volutes of the Ionic above the  acanthus leaves of the Corinthian proper. In reality the difference  is, here, but slight; and the best authorities maintain that there is  less difference between the Corinthian and the Composite than between  different examples of the Corinthian itself. The reason for the  dressed niches, with pediments instead of windows, like those in the  lower stage, will come later on. A main architrave and cornice run  round the entire building like an unbroken string course, and above  this, excepting at the different fronts, a balustrade, to which a  history is attached.    A new commission had been nominated after the death of Queen Anne[73]  (which by the way included Sir Isaac Newton), and this commission  insisted upon a balustrade unless the surveyor \"do in writing under  his hand set forth that it is contrary to the principles of  architecture, and give his opinion in a fortnight's time.\" Wren  answered, \"_Persons of little skill did expect, I believe, something  they had been used to in Gothic structures, and ladies think nothing  well without an edging._\" He urged that he had already terminated the  building, and that his design of pairs of pedestals in continuation of  the pilasters would better resist the wind. As in other matters, he  had to give way; and the difference in the effect cannot be judged  from mere illustrations.[74] The four angles, where the transepts  join, are filled up with the huge supporting bastion-like piers of the  dome; and internally are left, so to speak, hollow; that at the  south-west being utilised as a staircase, and the others on the ground  floor as vestries.    No roof is visible from below. The actual roof of oak and lead was so  flattened as to be invisible in accordance with the ideas of the  architect. \"_No Roofs almost but Spherick raised to be visible._\"  \"_The Ancients affected Flatness._\" \"_No Roofs can have Dignity enough  to appear above a Cornice, but the Circular._\"[75]    We now come to that peculiarity upon which so much adverse criticism  has been bestowed. The usual observer will wonder why there are niches  instead of windows in the upper stage, as light is so much needed. On  entering the interior he will notice that the height of the aisles  does not correspond with the exterior; and on ascending to the Stone  Gallery will ascertain that this upper stage of the exterior is not  part of the actual wall of the church, which stands back some thirty  feet. It is, in fact, a screen or curtain wall; the lower stage alone  is the wall of the aisles, and the disfiguring square openings with  which the pedestals below the niches are pierced, give light to the  passages and galleries between the aisles and the roof. Externally one  is supposed to see the wall of the cathedral; in reality one sees the  lower story forming the wall, and an upper story in continuation made  to look as though the church were immediately behind, but in reality  quite disengaged from it. The following is an able specimen of the  adverse criticisms that have been directed against this curtain: \"It  is a mere empty show with nothing behind it, and when once this is  known it is impossible to forget it, or to have the same feeling  towards the building which a spectator might have, despite its defects  of detail, who believed its external mass to represent its interior  arrangements.\"[76] Yet an attentive study of the \"Parentalia\" enables  us to plead a great deal in mitigation. The spectator will notice that  there are no substantial buttresses; and the reason is the simple one  that Wren held them to be disfigurements. \"_The Romans always  concealed their Butments._\"[77] \"_Oblique Positions are Discord to the  Eye unless answered in Pairs, as in the Sides of an equicrural  Triangle.... Gothick Buttresses are all ill-favoured, and were avoided  by the Ancients._\"[78] Such were the opinions of Wren; but how was he  to procure stability? The answer is, by the curtain wall. By its dead  weight pressing on the walls of the aisles it renders them stable and  immobile, free from all danger of thrust, while it conceals the  buttresses which render secure the clerestory stage of the building  proper. To paraphrase his own words: \"_I do not add buttresses, but I  build up the wall so high as by the addition of this extra weight, I  establish it as firmly as if I had added buttresses._\"[79] Thus this  wall performs a double function: it is a substitute for buttresses in  respect to the aisle walls, and a screen for the actual buttresses of  the clerestory stage.    Such is the purpose of the upper story. An ingenious critic who did  not seem to know this vindicates it on the plea that \"uninterrupted  altitude of the bulk in the same plane, is absolutely necessary to the  substructure of the mighty dome.\"[80] No doubt the size of the dome  requires a proportionate rise in the lower elevations; but the fact  remains that the exterior and interior do not correspond. A greater  authority than this critic has thus defined good architecture: \"The  essence of good architecture of any kind is that its constructive  system should be put boldly forward, that its decorative system should  be such as in no way conceals or masks the construction, but makes the  constructive features themselves ornamental.\"[81] And at his uncle's  cathedral of Ely, Wren might have borrowed and worked out an idea  which would have silenced all accusation of fraud and deceit. There,  in the central part of the choir on the south side, the roof was  removed and placed lower down centuries ago, the better to light up  certain shrines below. This roof was never restored to its original  position; and the upper stage of the wall is pierced with empty  windows through which flying-buttresses can now be seen. The effect,  though altogether unusual, is far from displeasing; and the spectator  who remembers that Wren was perfectly familiar with this building, is  led to wonder why he did not by piercing the niches, imitate Ely at  St. Paul's.    The Windows, round-headed and without tracery, contrast unfavourably  with the Lancet and Decorated. Wren recognised the value of tracery,  as is evident from his remarks on Salisbury Cathedral, although he  objected to the Perpendicular mullions and transoms.[82] Yet it is  difficult to see how he could have devised anything more elaborate or  graceful to harmonise. The carving above and below, in the  conventional festoons of the day, is almost universally voted as  respectable and nothing more. Mr. Ruskin is very severe on these  festoons, on the ground that they are tied heavily into a long bunch  thickest in the middle, and pinned up by both ends against a dead  wall, and contends that the architecture has no business with rich  ornament in any place.

[Illustration: FIG. 39.--The Earth viewed from Venus.]    When we contemplate this radiant Venus, it is difficult, even if we can  not form any definite idea as to her actual state as regards habitation,  to assume that she must be a dreary desert, and not, on the contrary,  to hail in her a celestial land, differing more or less from our own  dwelling-place, travailing with her sisters in the accomplishment of the  general plan of Nature.    Such are the characteristic features of our celestial neighbor. In  quitting her, we reach the Earth, which comes immediately next her in  order of distance, 149 million kilometers (93,000,000 miles) from the  Sun, but as we shall devote an entire chapter to our own planet, we will  not halt at this point, but cross in one step the distance that  separates Mars from Venus.    Let us only remark in passing, that our planet is the largest of the  four spheres adjacent to the Sun. Here are their comparative diameters:                             The Earth = 1.    In Kilometers.    In Miles.

MARS    Two hundred and twenty-six millions of kilometers (140,000,000 miles)  from the Sun is the planet Mars, gravitating in an orbit exterior to  that which the Earth takes annually round the same center.    Unfortunate Mars! What evil fairy presided at his birth? From  antiquity, all curses seem to have fallen upon him. He is the god of war  and of carnage, the protector of armies, the inspirer of hatred among  the peoples, it is he who pours out the blood of Humanity in  international hecatombs. Here, again, as in the case of Mercury and  Venus, the appearance has originated the idea. Mars, in fact, burns like  a drop of blood in the depths of the firmament, and it is this ruddy  color that inspired its name and attributes, just as the dazzling  whiteness of Venus made her the goddess of love and beauty. Why, indeed,  should the origins of mythology be sought elsewhere than in astronomy?    While Humanity was attributing to the presumptive influence of Mars the  defects inherent in its own terrestrial nature, this world, unwitting of  our sorrows, pursued the celestial path marked out for it in space by  destiny.    This planet is, as we have said, the first encountered after the Earth.  Its orbit is very elongated, very eccentric. Mars accomplishes it in a  period of 1 year, 321 days, 22 hours, _i.e._, 1 year, 10 months, 21  days, or 687 days. The velocity of its transit is 23 kilometers (14.5  miles) per second; that of the Earth is 30 (19 miles). Our planet,  traveling through space at an average distance of 149 million kilometers  (93,000,000 miles) from the central focus, is separated from Mars by an  average distance of 76 million kilometers (47,000,000 miles); but as its  orbit is equally elliptic and elongated it follows that at certain  epochs the two planets approach one another by something less than 60  million kilometers (37,000,000 miles). These are the periods selected  for making the best observations upon our neighbor of the ruddy rays.  The oppositions of Mars arrive about every twenty-six months, but the  periods of its greatest proximity, when this planet approaches to within  56 million kilometers (34,700,000 miles) of the Earth, occur only every  fifteen years.    Mars is then passing perihelion, while our world is at aphelion (or  greatest distance from the Sun). At such epochs this globe presents to  us an apparent diameter 63 times smaller than that of the Moon, _i.e._,  a telescope that magnifies 63 times would show him to us of the same  magnitude as our satellite viewed with the unaided eye, and an  instrument that magnified 630 times would show him ten times larger in  diameter.    In dimensions he differs considerably from our world, being almost half  the size of the Earth. In diameter he measures only 6,728 kilometers  (4,172 miles), and his circumference is 21,125 kilometers (13,000  miles). His surface is only 29/100 of the terrestrial surface, and his  volume only 15/100 of our own.    This difference in volume causes Mars to be an earth in miniature. When  we study his aspects, his geography, his meteorology, we seem to see in  space a reduction of our own abode, with certain dissimilarities that  excite our curiosity, and make him even more interesting to us.    The Martian world weighs nine times and a half less than our own. If we  represent the weight of the Earth by 1,000, that of Mars would be  represented by 105. His density is much less than our own; it is only  7/10 that of the Earth. A man weighing 70 kilograms, transported to the  adjacent globe, would weigh only 26 kilograms.    The earliest telescopic observations revealed the existence of more or  less accentuated markings upon the surface of Mars. The progress of  optics, admitting of greater magnifications, exhibited the form of these  patches more clearly, while the study of their motions enabled the  astronomers to determine with remarkable precision the diurnal rotation  of this planet. It occurs in 24 hours, 37 minutes, 23.65 seconds. Day  and night are accordingly a little longer on Mars than on the Earth, but  the difference is obviously inconsiderable. The year of Mars consists of  668 Martian days. The inclination of the axis of rotation of this globe  upon the plane of its orbit is much the same as our own. In  consequence, its seasons are analogous to ours in intensity, while twice  the length, the Martian year being almost equal to two of our years. The  intensity of the seasons is indeed more accentuated than upon the Earth,  since the orbit of Mars is very elongated. But there, as here, are three  quite distinct zones: the torrid, the temperate, and the glacial.    By means of the telescope we can follow the variations of the Martian  seasons, especially in what concerns the polar snows, which regularly  aggregate during the winter, and melt no less regularly during the heat  of the summer. These snows are very easily observed, and stand out  clearly with dazzling whiteness. The reader can judge of them by the  accompanying figure, which sums up the author's observations during one  of the recent oppositions of Mars (1900-1901). The size of the polar cap  diminished from 4,680 kilometers to 840. The solstice of the Martian  summer was on April 11th. The snows were still melting on July 6th.  Sometimes they disappear almost entirely during the Martian month that  corresponds to our month of August, as never happens with our polar ice.  Hence, though this planet is farther away from the Sun than ourselves,  it does not appear to be colder, or, at any rate, it is certain that the  polar snows are much less thick.    On the other hand, there are hardly ever clouds on Mars; the Martian  atmosphere is almost always limpid, and one can say that fine weather is  the chronic state of the planet. At times, light fogs or a little vapor  will appear in certain regions, but they are soon dissipated, and the  sky clears up again.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Diminution of the polar snows of Mars during  the summer.]    Since the invention of the telescope, a considerable number of drawings  have been made, depicting Mars under every aspect, and the agreement  between these numerous observations gives us a sufficient acquaintance  with the planet to admit of our indicating the characteristic features  of its geography, and of drawing out _areographic_ maps (_Ares_, Mars).  Its appearance can be judged of from the two drawings here reproduced,  as made (February, 1901) at the Observatory of Juvisy, and from the  general chart drawn from the total sum of observations (Figs. 41, 42 and  43).    It will be seen at the first glance that the geography of Mars is very  different from that of our own globe: while three-quarters of the Earth  are covered with the liquid element, Mars seems to be more evenly  divided, and must indeed have rather more land than water. We find no  immense oceans surrounding the continents, and separating them like  islands; on the contrary, the seas are reduced to long gulfs compressed  between the shores, like the Mediterranean for example, nor is it even  certain that these gray spots do all represent true seas. It has been  agreed to term _sea_ the parts that are lightly tinged with green, and  to give the name of _continent_ to the spots colored yellow. That is the  hue of the Martian soil, due either to the soil itself, which would  resemble that of the Sahara, or, to take a less arid region, that seen  on the line between Marseilles and Nice, in the vicinity of the  Esterels; or perhaps to some peculiar vegetation. During ascents in a  balloon, the author has often remarked that the hue of the ripe corn,  with the Sun shining on it, is precisely that presented to us by the  continents of Mars in the best hours for observation.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Telescopic aspect of the planet Mars (Feb.,  1901).]    As to the \"seas,\" it is pretty certain that there must be water, or  some kind of liquid, deriving above all from the melting of the polar  snows in spring and summer; but it may possibly be in conjunction with  some vegetation, aquatic plants, or perhaps vast meadows, which appear  to us from here to be the more considerable in proportion as the water  that nourishes them has been more abundant.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Telescopic aspect of the planet Mars (Feb.,  1901).]    Mars, like our globe, is surrounded with a protective atmosphere, which  retains the rays of the Sun, and must preserve a medium temperature  favorable to the conservation of life upon the"]]]
