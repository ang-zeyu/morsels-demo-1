From the same source the  embryo receives the oxygen necessary for the maintenance of its life.    From the third month on to the end of the nine months, the amount of  material which the mother must provide for the development of the  child within her womb amounts to no small draft on her physical  resources. It is not at all uncommon for a mother in the later months  of pregnancy to become quite pale, her blood having been impoverished  to provide material for the development of her child.      MATERNITY.    What has been said above regarding the contributions which the  maternal organism must make toward the development of the offspring  must have impressed on the mind of the reader that _maternity means,  first of all, sacrifice_.    This sacrifice begins when the girl first enters upon womanhood.    With the expulsion of the ripened ovum comes, each month, a week of  special physical drain, when work must be lightened and vigorous  exercise curtailed, when exposure to cold or dampness may mean loss of  health.    Under these circumstances a woman should at this time deny herself the  pleasure of dancing; of skating or swimming; of sleigh-rides or  cross-country walks and the young man should make it less difficult  for her by acquiescing without question or demur in her request to be  excused from such recreation.    It is a fact that more sacrifice is involved in maternity among the  more highly cultivated nations of the human race than is true of  aboriginal peoples, or among the lower animals. Conditions of modern  life, and particularly urban life, leave the female organism less able  to endure the drafts made upon the system by maternity, so that to  bear a child may mean not only the sacrifice of comfort, but even the  sacrifice of health.    The highly sensitive, delicately adjusted nervous system of the woman  is perhaps more profoundly influenced than any other part of her  being. This manifests itself particularly in a heightened degree of  sensitiveness. It goes without saying that the pregnant woman  deserves at the hands of all who come in contact with her, and  particularly at the hands of her husband, most considerate and  sympathetic treatment. Her little whims and vagaries, however  unreasonable, must always be treated seriously, and with delicate and  tactful consideration. The members of her family, particularly the  husband, owe it to her and to her child to keep her in as happy a  frame of mind as possible.    When we consider the real significance of maternity to the race, to  society, and to the family, we must feel that, of all human relations,  maternity is the most sacred, and that no condition should be allowed  to mar it, and no consideration to take precedence of it.      PATERNITY.    After the husband had contributed the male sexual cells, or  spermatozoa, in this wonderful process above outlined, it might seem  that there is little he can do, except to wait, while nature carries  on the process. The reader will remember, however, from the chapter on  Reproduction, that the contribution of the spermatozoa only initiates  the sacrifices that the paternal organism must make in this process.  Are there any demands on paternity between the time of conception of  the new life and its birth?    As already mentioned under the preceding topic, the pregnant mother  needs gentle and loving care. She needs to have her little whims and  foibles overlooked. She needs to be protected, so far as possible,  from every influence that might depress or make her unhappy. She needs  to be guarded against any unusual physical exertion, and above all,  she needs at this time more than at any other time, the manifested  affection and sympathy of her husband.    There is another sacrifice, if it may be so called, which the husband  is called upon to make during the pregnancy of his wife, namely, _to  abstain absolutely from sexual intercourse during the period of  pregnancy and for two or three months following_. This means  practically one year of continent living. All other animals observe  this period of continence. Nature demands that man observe it in  common with other animals. Man is the only animal that has  transgressed this fundamental law of nature. The retribution which  nature metes out to the transgression of this law is various.  Sometimes, but rarely, the sexual excitement on the part of the woman  may cause an abortion, or a miscarriage. The more usual result makes  itself manifest in the drain on the nervous energy of the woman. When  we consider that maternity in the human race involves greater  sacrifice than in any other animal, it would seem that the addition of  this last demand, namely, of satisfying the sexual desires of the  husband during the period of pregnancy, might prove \"the straw that  breaks the camel's back,\" and result in the more or less complete  nervous breakdown of the woman. The author submits this question to  all fair-minded men: Is it not due to the wife that she be not asked  to satisfy the recurring sexual desires of the husband during the  period when her life and its energies are so sacred to the race, to  society, and to the family?    The author submits this question because some men are known to  transgress this law of nature. Fortunately the proportion of men who  thus transgress is not large.    Let us stand for these things: (1) _An equal standard of purity for  men and women_, (2) _A strenuous, virile, continent manhood_, (3)  _Sexual temperance in wedlock_.          APPENDIX          APPENDIX.      Personal conferences and correspondence with young men regarding the  solution of their problems have brought out several questions that are  so frequently repeated as to make it evident that the answering of  them would serve the purpose of clearing up certain questions or  doubts, more or less important in the minds of many young men. It has  been decided to group these answers in an appendix rather than to  incorporate them in the body of the book, as many of them seem not  quite relevant to the topics outlined under the several chapters.    1. _How do we know that during the nocturnal emission the products of  the testes are not present?_    The spermatozoa found in the nocturnal emission, if present at all,  are found to be very much less active than the spermatozoa of semen  secreted during sexual excitement. The seminal vesicles are not  receptacles for the testicular secretion. The ampullae seem to serve  that purpose in a limited degree.    Considering all these facts, it seems to be a tenable conclusion that  the few and sluggish spermatozoa seen in the product of the nocturnal  emission are those that have, from time to time, collected in the  ampullae, and that during the time immediately preceding the nocturnal  emission the testes are not actively releasing nascent spermatozoa.  This function of the testes seems to be reserved for periods of  conscious sexual stimulation.    2. _How may one control too frequent emissions?_    If emissions are too frequent for the individual case, they are  followed by depletion and malaise. Even if they occur as infrequently  as once in two weeks and are followed by the above symptoms, they must  be considered as too frequent, or abnormal in that case. On the other  hand, they may occur as frequently as twice a week in plethoric robust  individuals, and especially in men who have had frequent sexual  intercourse, and who have for some reason discontinued it. And even  though they occur as frequently as twice a week, if they are followed  by a feeling of relief and wellbeing, they must not be considered as  too frequent for that individual under the conditions.    So the frequency limit of nocturnal emissions is more or less  independent of the time and quite dependent upon the reaction of the  individual to the emission. If, following the criterion above  outlined, one finds that his emissions are too frequent, because of  accompanying depletion and malaise, this frequency may be modified  either by changes of the diet or by changes of hygiene.    For a more extended discussion, see text above on nocturnal emissions.    3. _Do the organs of reproduction actually develop after the age of  seventeen or nineteen or even to the twenty-fifth year as is the  case with the physical and mental powers?_    The brain of an individual adds no nerve cells after a very early age.  The brain increases only very slightly in size and weight after the  age of puberty, and then only under special conditions and this  increase in weight and size is not due to the addition of any new  cells, but simply to a slight increase in the bulk of those cells  already present. In a similar way the sexual apparatus undergoes,  during the period of puberty (fifteen to seventeen) a very rapid  growth, reaching by the end of the period of puberty (seventeenth or  nineteenth year) their full size.    4. _Are enlarged veins in the scrotum dangerous?_    Enlarged veins of the scrotum represent dilatation of the veins of the  epididymis. These are thin walled vessels that respond to any  increased internal blood pressure, perhaps showing a special tendency  in this direction during that period of rapid growth of the sexual  apparatus in the early part of the adolescent period. If the  enlargement is only moderate, it may disappear, or at least become  spontaneously arrested in its growth, in which case it need cause no  concern. If these veins, however, dilate until they form a  considerable mass, known as VARICOCELE, they may affect the sexual  apparatus deleteriously in two ways: (1) The increased weight in the  scrotal sac may cause the sac to become elongated and to annoy the  subject by its traction on the spermatic cord. This lengthened scrotum  with its contents may also be exposed to mechanical pressure or even  to injury from the clothing, etc., which would not occur if the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#16)"],[1,"house. Here is a case from the records which probably illustrates  the method as well as any other:    An elderly man, about sixty years of age, entered a panel-room with a  dark-haired, flashily-dressed woman, who immediately requested him to  bolt the door. This he did, but he might have saved himself the trouble,  for the door was no more closed then than it was before. These bolts are  very ingenious. The catch on the jamb of the door into which the bolt  slides has three false screw-heads in it. In reality it is not attached  to the door-casing at all, but is fastened to the body of the bolt by an  unseen plate. Consequently, when the door is opened, the catch goes  forward with the remainder of the bolt. This, of course, was not noticed  by the man, as the gas was not turned up by the woman till after the  door was closed. While the man was bolting the door the woman hurried to  the dressing-table and hastily laid her hat on one chair and her cloak  on the other. This action compelled the man to place his clothes on the  couch or on one of the chairs by the folding doors. When all was ready,  one of the operators scratched lightly on the door with his finger-nail,  to warn the woman he was about to enter the room. The next moment the  man boldly opened the door wide, removed the chair out of his way, and  glided rapidly to the other chair, on which the man's clothes lay. At  this moment the woman redoubled her fascinations, for the purpose of  distracting the attention of her companion, in which intent she was  eminently successful. The work of going through the man's pockets, and  what is technically known as \"weeding\" his pocket-book, was quickly  over, the chair was quietly replaced, the panel-door closed, and the  thief appeared with a roll of bills in his hand. The whole thing was  done in from twenty to twenty-five seconds. Immediately after the  closing of the door the man went outside, and, knocking on the  passage-door of the bedroom, said in a loud whisper.    \"Jenny, here's Joe; hurry up.\"    \"My God!\" exclaimed the girl, jumping up, \"you must get away as fast as  you can. That's my lover. He's dreadful jealous, and would shoot you as  soon as look at you.\"    It is needless to say that the victim required no urging. He jumped into  his clothes as fast as possible, only too glad to get out of the way  before the appearance of the terrible imaginary lover, and apparently  without the slightest notion that he had been robbed.    The victims of these thefts have really no redress. It is so hard to  find the guilty woman afterwards, or even to locate the house, for  unless the pleasure hunter suspects some trap he pays no particular  attention to the kind of house, its situation, or its number. In the  case of a stranger he never seeks the thieves again, but \"pockets his  loss.\" If an elderly man, he does likewise. But if he be really an  obstinate man, determined upon catching the thieves and prosecuting  them, he will invariably be approached and his money and valuables will  be returned to him upon condition that he withdraws his complaint.  Convictions are very rarely obtained in any case from the difficulty of  identifying the parties.    Many of these women never see a penny of the plundered money, the man,  in most cases, retaining the whole of the loot. It sometimes happens  that a victim discovers that he has been robbed before he leaves, and  makes what is called in the vernacular a \"kick\"; if so, it also  sometimes happens that he is unmercifully beaten by the lover and his  pals, but it has occurred that when \"the kicker\" was a man about town,  that he has gotten away with his assailant in a manner calculated to  make the heart of a Sullivan beat with pleasure.    There is quite a different feature of this panel-game, but which more  properly belongs to black-mail, in which, through the peep-holes in the  doors, the face of the man or woman in the adjoining room is studied,  waited for on the outside, followed to his or her home, and in a few  days threatened with exposure, if the sum demanded is not forthcoming.    Couples have been known to ply the panel-game very successfully in some  of the most prominent hotels in the city. The lady would make her  conquest upon the streets in the ordinary manner and the game would be  worked in two rooms of the hotel as already described. This enterprise  was carried on successfully by a scoundrel and his wife at one time in  one of the best hotels, and although it was generally known, there never  was any one to complain against them. It was only by the proprietor  specially employing several detectives that they were finally  discovered, arrested and punished.        CHAPTER IX.    A THEATRICAL ROMANCE.    _Kale Fisher, the Famous Mazeppa, involved--Manager Hemmings charged  by Fast-paced Mrs. Bethune with Larceny._    A good many years since, at a fashionable boardinghouse in Philadelphia,  a handsome Adonis-shapen young man, well and favorably known by the name  of George Hemmings, became acquainted with a member of the fairer sex  who had scarcely passed \"sweet sixteen,\" and was accredited with a  bountiful supply of beauty, named then Eliza Garrett. An intimacy at  once sprung up between the two, which at length ripened into a mutual  attachment.    A series of journeys were undertaken by Miss Garrett and Hemmings, and  for some time they lived together enjoying all the pleasures and sweets  of love; but for some cause the pair separated, and for a number of  years saw nothing of each other. Meantime, many changes had occurred in  the circumstances of both. Eliza had been transformed into Mrs. Bethune  and lived in a fashionable part of Gotham, her reputed husband, John  Bethune, Esquire, being a gentleman of wealth and sporting  proclivities.    George Hemmings, who, by the way, was very respectably connected, had  migrated from the \"City of Brotherly Love\" to \"Gotham,\" and filled a  position as superintendent in a dry-goods establishment.    It was whilst in this city, when \"walking down Broadway\" one afternoon,  Hemmings' attention was attracted by a lady who seemed to have been  previously pleased with his acquaintance, and in whom he recognized his  former inamorata, Miss Garrett. A grand recapitulation of the  pleasantries of by-gone days ensued, and the damsel informed her \"once  dear George\" that she was now Mrs. Bethune, but prevailed upon him to  accompany her to her home. Here a hearty welcome was accorded him, and,  if his statement be correct, it is said that the intimacy of former  times was renewed.    Matters continued in this manner, and Hemmings was induced to leave his  former situation and take up his abode at the residence of Mrs. Bethune  as general superintendent of that household, inasmuch as Mr. Bethune  himself was occasionally absent from the city.    On one occasion, as Mr. Hemmings alleged, the beauteous Mrs. Bethune was  violently assaulted by her better-half for some alleged indiscretion,  and it was her early lover who played the part of Good Samaritan on the  occasion, comforting her as well as he was able himself, and calling in  a physician to bind up her wounds. During her sickness, the relationship  between Hemmings and the lady seems to have been of the most intimate  character. She gave him a pair of diamond ear-rings to pledge for four  hundred dollars, which money was a portion of an amount which was to be  called into requisition for the necessary engagements and other expenses  incurred at the opening of a theatre in Pittsburg, the management to be  assumed by Miss Kate Fisher, the well-known \"Mazeppa\" and equestrienne  actress, and George Hemmings. A troupe was thereupon engaged, and the  entire company, including Miss Fisher and Hemmings, started for  Pennsylvania, where they intended to delight the inhabitants with the  drama of the \"fiery, untamed steed\" order.    Soon after \"Cupid George\" departed for the West, Mrs. Bethune became a  prey to the \"green-eyed monster.\" She realized the temptations that  would surely beset George as he basked in the smiles of the alluring and  classically modeled equestrienne. Other troubles beset Mrs. Bethune at  this juncture. Her husband asked her one day what had become of her  diamond ear-rings, and she was seized with confusion and dismay. To  disclose the truth would be to incur Bethune's jealousy, natural  indignation and too probable violence, and so the convenient idea seems  to have occurred to her that by accusing Hemmings of the theft of the  jewelry, she would achieve a two-fold success; namely, the one of  concealing her own frailty, and the other of snatching her beloved one  from a hated supposed rival. Bethune, believing her story, obtained a  requisition from Governor Fenton and procured Hemmings' arrest in  Pittsburg, and he was accordingly brought to this city. The services of  Howe & Hummel were called into requisition, and Hemmings brought into  court for trial.    The greatest excitement was aroused amongst theatrical and sporting  celebrities, and long before the opening of the court every seat was  filled by eager and expectant spectators, and when the prisoner was  called to the bar an immense throng surged to and fro to obtain a  glimpse at his features, and those of the accusing beauty.    City Judge Russel presided, and the Hon. Robert C. Hutchings, afterwards  Surrogate, conducted the prosecution.    Mr. Hutchings opened the case for the people in a fair and temperate  speech, stating that he was instructed that he should be enabled to  establish a clear case of larceny against the defendant, who then stood  indicted for having, on the 19th of October, 1868, at the city of New  York, feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away, one pair of diamond  ear-rings of the value of $400, the property of one James A. Lynch.    Mr. Hutchings then called Mrs. Eliza Bethune, who, amidst breathless  silence, was sworn, and testified that"]]]
