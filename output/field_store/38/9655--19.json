So he spake:    \"Hearken, children!  I am old and war-wise; but my wisdom is the wisdom  of the sword of the mighty warrior, that knoweth which way it should  wend, and hath no thought of turning back till it lieth broken in the  field.  Such wisdom is good against Folks that we have met heretofore; as  when we have fought with the Huns, who would sweep us away from the face  of the earth, or with the Franks or the Burgundians, who would quell us  into being something worser than they be.  But here is a new foe, and new  wisdom, and that right shifty, do we need to meet them.  One wise duke  have ye gotten, Thiodolf to wit; and he is young beside me and beside  Otter of the Laxings.  And now if ye must needs have an older man to  stand beside him, (and that is not ill) take ye Otter; for old though his  body be, the thought within him is keen and supple like the best of Welsh-  wrought blades, and it liveth in the days that now are: whereas for me,  meseemeth, my thoughts are in the days bygone.  Yet look to it, that I  shall not fail to lead as the sword of the valiant leadeth, or the shaft  shot by the cunning archer.  Choose ye Otter; I have spoken over long.\"    Then spoke Agni the Dayling, and laughed withal: \"One man of the Folk  hath spoken for Otter and against Heriulf--now let others speak if they  will!\"    So the cry came forth, \"Otter let it be, we will have Otter!\"    \"Speaketh any against Otter?\" said Agni.  But there was no voice raised  against him.    Then Agni said: \"Come forth, Otter of the Laxings, and hold the ring with  Thiodolf.\"    Then Otter went up on to the hill and stood by Thiodolf, and they held  the ring together; and then each thrust his hand and arm through the ring  and clasped hands together, and stood thus awhile, and all the Folk  shouted together.    Then spake Agni: \"Now shall we hew the horses and give the gifts to the  Gods.\"    Therewith he and the two War-dukes came down from the hill; and stood  before the altar; and the nine warriors of the Daylings stood forth with  axes to hew the horses and with copper bowls wherein to catch the blood  of them, and each hewed down his horse to the Gods, but the two War-dukes  slew the tenth and fairest: and the blood was caught in the bowls, and  Agni took a sprinkler and went round about the ring of men, and cast the  blood of the Gods'-gifts over the Folk, as was the custom of those days.    Then they cut up the carcases and burned on the altar the share of the  Gods, and Agni and the War-dukes tasted thereof, and the rest they bore  off to the Daylings' abode for the feast to be holden that night.    Then Otter and Thiodolf spake apart together for awhile, and presently  went up again on to the Speech-Hill, and Thiodolf said:       \"O kindreds of the Markmen; to-morrow with the day     We shall wend up Mirkwood-water to bar our foes the way;     And there shall we make our wain-burg on the edges of the wood,     Where in the days past over at last the aliens stood,     The Slaughter Tofts ye call it.  There tidings shall we get     If the curse of the world is awakened, and the serpent crawleth yet     Amidst the Mirkwood thicket; and when the sooth we know,     Then bearing battle with us through the thicket shall we go,     The ancient Wood-wolf's children, and the People of the Shield,     And the Spear-kin and the Horse-kin, while the others keep the field     About the warded wain-burg; for not many need we there     Where amidst of the thickets' tangle and the woodland net they fare,     And the hearts of the aliens falter and they curse the fight ne'er     done,     And wonder who is fighting and which way is the sun.\"    Thus he spoke; then Agni took up the war-horn again, and blew a blast,  and then he cried out:       \"Now sunder we the Folk-mote! and the feast is for to-night,     And to-morrow the Wayfaring; But unnamed is the day of the fight;     O warriors, look ye to it that not long we need abide     'Twixt the hour of the word we have spoken, and our fair-fame's     blooming tide!     For then 'midst the toil and the turmoil shall we sow the seeds of     peace,     And the Kindreds' long endurance, and the Goth-folk's great increase.\"    Then arose the last great shout, and soberly and in due order, kindred by  kindred, they turned and departed from the Thing-stead and went their way  through the wood to the abode of the Daylings.          CHAPTER IX--THE ANCIENT MAN OF THE DAYLINGS      There still hung the more part of the stay-at-homes round about the Roof.  But on the plain beneath the tofts were all the wains of the host drawn  up round about a square like the streets about a market-place; all these  now had their tilts rigged over them, some white, some black, some red,  some tawny of hue; and some, which were of the Beamings, green like the  leafy tree.    The warriors of the host went down into this wain-town, which they had  not fenced in any way, since they in no wise looked for any onset there;  and there were their thralls dighting the feast for them, and a many of  the Dayling kindred, both men and women, went with them; but some men did  the Daylings bring into their Roof, for there was room for a good many  besides their own folk.  So they went over the Bridge of turf into the  garth and into the Great Roof of the Daylings; and amongst these were the  two War-dukes.    So when they came to the dais it was as fair all round about there as  might well be; and there sat elders and ancient warriors to welcome the  guests; and among them was the old carle who had sat on the edge of the  burg to watch the faring of the host, and had shuddered back at the sight  of the Wolfing Banner.    And when the old carle saw the guests, he fixed his eyes on Thiodolf, and  presently came up and stood before him; and Thiodolf looked on the old  man, and greeted him kindly and smiled on him; but the carle spake not  till he had looked on him a while; and at last he fell a-trembling, and  reached his hands out to Thiodolf's bare head, and handled his curls and  caressed them, as a mother does with her son, even if he be a grizzled-  haired man, when there is none by: and at last he said:       \"How dear is the head of the mighty, and the apple of the tree     That blooms with the life of the people which is and yet shall be!     It is helmed with ancient wisdom, and the long remembered thought,     That liveth when dead is the iron, and its very rust but nought.     Ah! were I but young as aforetime, I would fare to the battle-stead     And stand amidst of the spear-hail for the praise of the hand and the     head!\"    Then his hands left Thiodolf's head, and strayed down to his shoulders  and his breast, and he felt the cold rings of the hauberk, and let his  hands fall down to his side again; and the tears gushed out of his old  eyes and again he spake:       \"O house of the heart of the mighty, O breast of the battle-lord     Why art thou coldly hidden from the flickering flame of the sword?     I know thee not, nor see thee; thou art as the fells afar     Where the Fathers have their dwelling, and the halls of Godhome are:     The wind blows wild betwixt us, and the cloud-rack flies along,     And high aloft enfoldeth the dwelling of the strong;     They are, as of old they have been, but their hearths flame not for     me;     And the kindness of their feast-halls mine eyes shall never see.\"    Thiodolf's lips still smiled on the old man, but a shadow had come over  his eyes and his brow; and the chief of the Daylings and their mighty  guests stood by listening intently with the knit brows of anxious men;  nor did any speak till the ancient man again betook him to words:       \"I came to the house of the foeman when hunger made me a fool;     And the foeman said, 'Thou art weary, lo, set thy foot on the stool;'     And I stretched out my feet,--and was shackled: and he spake with a     dastard's smile,     'O guest, thine hands are heavy; now rest them for a while!'     So I stretched out my hands, and the hand-gyves lay cold on either     wrist:     And the wood of the wolf had been better than that feast-hall, had I     wist     That this was the ancient pit-fall, and the long expected trap,     And that now for my heart's desire I had sold the world's goodhap.\"    Therewith the ancient man turned slowly away from Thiodolf, and departed  sadly to his own place.  Thiodolf changed countenance but little, albeit  those about him looked strangely on him, as though if they durst they  would ask him what these words might be, and if he from his hidden  knowledge might fit a meaning to them.  For to many there was a word of  warning in them, and to some an evil omen of the days soon to be; and  scarce anyone heard those words but he had a misgiving in his heart, for  the ancient man was known to be foreseeing, and wild and strange his  words seemed to them.    But Agni would make light of it, and he said: \"Asmund the Old is of good  will, and wise he is; but he hath great longings for the deeds of men,  when he hath tidings of battle; for a great warrior and a red-hand hewer  he hath been in times past; he loves the Kindred, and deems it ill if he  may not fare afield with them; for the thought of dying in the straw is  hateful to him.\"    \"Yea,\" said another, \"and moreover he hath seen sons whom he loved slain  in battle; and when he seeth a warrior in his prime he becometh dear to  him, and he feareth for him.\"    \"Yet,\" said a third, \"Asmund is foreseeing; and may be, Thiodolf, thou  wilt wot of the drift of these words, and tell us thereof.\"    But Thiodolf spake nought of the matter, though in his heart he pondered  it.    So the guests were led to table, and the feast began, within the hall and  without it, and wide about the plain; and the Dayling maidens went in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28865"],[0,"Der Judenstaat: Versuch einer modernen Lösung der Judenfrage (#16)"],[1,"in das Gelobte Land. Und mit der schrecklichen Macht der  Gewohnheit muss die herrliche Macht der Begeisterung ringen.    Die Verfolgungen sind nicht mehr so bösartig wie im Mittelalter? Ja,  aber unsere Empfindlichkeit ist gewachsen, so dass wir keine  Verminderung der Leiden spüren. Die lange Verfolgung hat unsere Nerven  überreizt.    Und wird man noch sagen: die Unternehmung sei hoffnungslos, selbst wenn  wir das Land und die Souveränetät bekommen -- weil nur die Armen  mitgehen werden? Gerade die brauchen wir zuerst! Nur die Desperados  taugen zum Erobern.    Wird Jemand sagen: Ja, wenn das möglich wäre, hätte man es schon  gemacht?    Früher war es nicht möglich. Jetzt ist es möglich. Noch vor  hundert, vor fünfzig Jahren wäre es eine Schwärmerei gewesen, Heute ist  das Alles wirklich. Die Reichen, die einen genussvollen Ueberblick über  sämmtliche technischen Errungenschaften haben, wissen sehr gut, was mit  Geld alles gemacht werden kann. Und so wird es zugehen: gerade die Armen  und Einfachen, die gar nicht ahnen, welche Gewalt über die Naturkräfte  der Mensch schon besitzt, werden die neue Botschaft am stärksten  glauben. Denn sie haben die Hoffnung auf das Gelobte Land nicht  verloren.    Da ist es, Juden! Kein Märchen, kein Betrug! Jeder kann sich davon  überzeugen, denn Jeder trägt ein Stück vom Gelobten Land hinüber: der in  seinem Kopf, und der in seinen Armen, und Jener in seinem erworbenen  Gut.    Nun könnte es scheinen, als wäre das eine langwierige Sache. Auch im  günstigsten Falle würde der Beginn der Staatsgründung noch viele Jahre  auf sich warten lassen. Inzwischen werden die Juden auf tausend Punkten  gehänselt, gekränkt, gescholten, geprügelt, geplündert und erschlagen.  Nein, wenn wir auch nur beginnen, den Plan auszuführen, kommt der  Antisemitismus überall und sofort zum Stillstand. Denn es ist der  Friedensschluss.    Wenn die Jewish Company gebildet ist, wird diese Nachricht in einem Tage  nach den fernsten Punkten der Erde durch den Blitz unserer Drähte  hinausgetragen worden sein.    Und augenblicklich beginnt auch die Erleichterung. Aus den Mittelständen  fliessen unsere überproducirten mittleren Intelligenzen, fliessen ab in  unsere ersten Organisationen, bilden unsere ersten Techniker, Officiere,  Professoren, Beamten, Juristen, Aerzte. Und so geht die Sache weiter,  eilig und doch ohne Erschütterung.    Man wird in den Tempeln beten für das Gelingen des Werkes. Aber in den  Kirchen auch! Es ist die Lösung eines alten Druckes, unter dem Alle  litten.    Aber zunächst muss es licht werden in den Köpfen. Der Gedanke muss  hinausfliegen bis in die letzten jammervollen Nester, wo unsere Leute  wohnen. Sie werden aufwachen aus ihrem dumpfen Brüten. Denn in unser  Aller Leben kommt ein neuer Inhalt. Jeder braucht nur an sich selbst zu  denken, und der Zug wird schon ein gewaltiger.    Und welcher Ruhm erwartet die selbstlosen Kämpfer für die Sache!    Darum glaube ich, dass ein Geschlecht wunderbarer Juden aus der Erde  wachsen wird. Die Makkabäer werden wieder aufstehen.    Noch einmal sei das Wort des Anfangs wiederholt: Die Juden, die wollen,  werden ihren Staat haben.    Wir sollen endlich als freie Männer auf unserer eigenen Scholle leben  und in unserer eigenen Heimat ruhig sterben.    Die Welt wird durch unsere Freiheit befreit, durch unseren Reichthum  bereichert, und vergrössert durch unsere Grösse.    Und was wir dort nur für unser eigenes Gedeihen versuchen, wirkt  machtvoll und beglückend hinaus zum Wohle aller Menschen.
