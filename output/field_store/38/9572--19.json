The Fine Arts.      LEUTZE'S WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE.--Our readers are aware of the  accident by fire which happened some months since to Leutze's  nearly-finished picture of Washington Crossing the Delaware, in  consequence of which he abandoned it to the underwriters, intending to  commence the work anew for the party from which he had received the  order to paint it. The underwriters have accordingly paid the insurance,  and are now exhibiting the picture in its incomplete state to the public  of Cologne, where it meets with high approval. The _Koelnische Zeitung_  says of it: \"In this picture the artist has depicted the events of the  hour in which the destiny of the Free States of North America was  decided for centuries through the boldness of their courageous and  prudent leader. The means of continuing the war were almost exhausted;  the army threatened in a few days to dissolve itself; the cause of  freedom for that continent, with its inestimable consequences for  ancient Europe, would have been postponed, no one can tell how long,  perhaps for ever. Then the great mind of Washington conceived what the  morally debased, reposing enemy thought impossible. He crossed the  Delaware with his army in the night, amid masses of floating ice, and,  in the twilight of morning, assailed the inactive camp on the other  side. The picture reproduces the moment when the great general,--ahead  of the mass of the army, which had also just embarked, and part of which  are passing off from the shore, and part already struggling with the  driving ice,--is steering to the opposite shore in a small boat,  surrounded by eleven heroic figures, officers, farmers, soldiers, and  boatmen. The tall and majestic form of the man in whose hands at that  hour lay the fate of millions, rises from the group, standing slightly  bent, forward, with one foot on the bottom of the boat, the other on the  forward bench. His mild yet serious and commanding glance seems seeking  to pierce the mist of the farther shore and discover the enemy, while  intimations of the future grandeur of his country rise upon his mind.  Nothing of youthful rashness appears in the expression of this figure,  but the thoughtful artist has depicted the 'heart for any fate' of the  general and statesman in noble, vigorous, and faithful traits. And what  an impulse moves through the group of his companions! Their thought is,  'Forward, invincibly forward, for our country!' This is expressed in  their whole bearing, in every movement, in the eyes and features of all.  Under the influence of this thought they command the raging elements, so  that the masses of ice seem to dissolve before the will and energy of  these men. This is a picture by the sight of which, in this weary and  exhausted time, one can recover health and strength. Let none miss a  draught from such a goblet of nectar. And while we are writing this, it  occurs to us that it was at this very hour seventy-four years ago, in  the ice-cold night, Washington crossed the Delaware. And amid the  ominous concatenation of events which the weak mind calls accident, but  which the clear spirit, whose eye rests on the whole world, regards as  the movement of nature according to eternal laws, there rises from our  soul the ardent prayer that Germany may soon find her Washington! Honor  and fame to the artist whose production has power to work upon the  hearts and inflame the spirits of all that behold it!\"    Messrs. Goupil & Co. have purchased the duplicate of this work, to be  completed on the first of July, for seven thousand dollars. The picture  described was unfinished, and has been exhibited by the underwriters, to  whom it was given up after the fire.           *       *       *       *       *    An Italian picture dealer in London named Campanari, lately bought for a  trifle a portrait which has proved to be a genuine Michel Angelo. It  represents the famous Vittoria Colonna, wife of the Marchese Pescara,  the General of Charles V. She was herself distinguished as a poetess as  well as by the impassioned love and adoration of the great painter, who  not only took her portrait, but left behind him several sonnets in her  honor. Campanari, though himself confident of the genuineness of the  picture, could not procure it to be recognized in England. Accordingly  he sent it to Rome, where the Academy of San Luca, with Minardi at its  head, unanimously decided in its favor. In fact, it contains a grandeur  and sublimity which could be ascribed to nobody but the author of the  prophets and sibyls of the Sistine Chapel. An antique repose is  displayed in the whole work, perfectly agreeing with the character of  the lady as described by Michel Angelo, and which suits the advanced age  at which she is painted. The execution is like that of the picture in  the Florentine Tribune, in the wonderful facility of its execution. In  the coloring a carnation hue is remarkable, like that in Michel Angelo's  Roman works. The hands of the figure are thought to be by some other  artist. Only the head and part of the person seem to be by the author.  The picture has suffered little from time, some parts having apparently  been repaired by a later pencil. It is valued at $30,000.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MUNICH ART-UNION gives to its subscribers for the next year a  _galvanograph_ of Rubens' Columbus. This is the first time that  galvanography has been applied to such a purpose. The plate from which  the print is taken has been copied by the galvanoplastic process, so  that it can serve for other art-unions also. For 1851 the Munich Union  has decided on engraving four Greek landscapes by C. Rottman. These  plates will also be copied by the same process, and may be had at much  less than the cost of original plates.          GOETHE'S OPINION OF BYRON, SCOTT, AND CARLYLE.      Mr. John Oxenford, who has shown remarkable capacities for  appropriation, in the use he has made of the labors of William Peter,  Parke Godwin, and others, in his various \"translations\" from the German,  has recently fallen in with Margaret Fuller d'Ossoli's version of the  _Conversations of Goethe with Eckermann_, published many years ago by  Mr. Ripley in his \"Specimens of Foreign Literature;\" and the result is  two volumes, embracing, with what Margaret Fuller translated, the great  poet's conversations with Soret. Among the chief notable men who existed  at the time of the conversations, and to whom reference is made, are  Scott and Byron. The first, whose _Fair Maid of Perth_ is read as a new  book, is praised for his \"objective\" qualities. The second is pronounced  the greatest modern poet of England, but censured for his polemic  tendency. Goethe's rapture is kindled when he speaks of him:         \"'Lord Byron,' said Goethe, 'is to be regarded as a man, as an       Englishman, and as a great talent. His good qualities belong       chiefly to the man, his bad to the Englishman and the peer, his       talent is incommensurable. All Englishmen are, as such, without       reflection, properly so called; distractions and party spirit       will not permit them to unfold themselves in quiet. But they       are great as practical men. Thus, Lord Byron could never attain       reflection on himself, and on this account the maxims in       general are not successful, as is shown by his creed, 'much       money, no authority,' for much money always paralyzes       authority. But where he will create, he always succeeds; and we       may truly say that with him inspiration supplies the place of       reflection. He was always obliged to go on poetizing, and then       every thing that came from the man, especially from his heart,       was excellent. He produced his best things, as women do pretty       children, without thinking about it or knowing how it was done.       He is a great talent, a born talent, and I never saw the true       poetical power greater in any man than in him. In the       apprehension of external objects, and a clear penetration into       past situations, he is quite as great as Shakspeare. But as a       pure individuality, Shakspeare is his superior. This was felt       by Byron, and on this account he does not say much of       Shakspeare, although he knows whole passages by heart. He would       willingly have denied him altogether, for Shakspeare's       cheerfulness is in his way, and he feels that he is no match       for it. Pope he does not deny, for he had no cause to fear him.       On the contrary, he mentions him, and shows him respect when he       can, for he knows well enough that Pope is a mere foil to       himself.'...         \"Goethe seemed inexhaustible on the subject of Byron, and I       felt that I could not listen enough. After a few digressions,       he proceeded thus: 'His high rank as an English peer was very       injurious to Byron; for every talent is oppressed by the outer       world,--how much more, then, when there are such high birth and       so great a fortune. A certain middle rank is much more       favorable to talent, on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I.

GOATS.--REMARKABLE VARIATIONS OF.    The breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied, though much  still remains to be done, than those of almost any other domesticated  animal. This has been effected by Hermann von Nathusius in two admirable  works, especially in the later one on the Skulls of the several races, and  by Ruetimeyer in his celebrated Fauna of the ancient Swiss  lake-dwellings.[144] Nathusius has shown that all the known breeds may be  divided in two great groups: one resembling in all important respects and  no doubt descended from the common wild boar; so that this may be called  the _Sus scrofa_ group. The other group differs in several important and  constant osteological characters; its wild parent-form is unknown; the name  given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of priority, is _Sus Indica_  of Pallas. This name must now be followed, though an unfortunate one, as  the wild aboriginal does not inhabit India, and the best-known domesticated  breeds have been imported from Siam and China.    {66}    Firstly, the _Sus scrofa_ breeds, or those resembling the common wild boar.  These still exist, according to Nathusius (Schweineschaedel, s. 75), in  various parts of central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom,[145]  and almost every province in Britain, possessed its own native breed; but  these are now everywhere rapidly disappearing, being replaced by improved  breeds crossed with the _S. Indica_ form. The skull in the breeds of the  _S. scrofa_ type resembles, in all important respects, that of the European  wild boar; but it has become (Schweineschaedel, s. 63-68) higher and broader  relatively to its length; and the hinder part is more upright. The  differences, however, are all variable in degree. The breeds which thus  resemble _S. scrofa_ in their essential skull-characters differ  conspicuously from each other in other respects, as in the length of the  ears and legs, curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and  proportions of the body.    The wild _Sus scrofa_ has a wide range, namely, Europe, North Africa, as  identified by osteological characters by Ruetimeyer, and Hindostan, as  similarly identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars inhabiting these  several countries differ so much from each other in external characters,  that they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct.  Even within Hindostan these animals, according to Mr. Blyth, form very  distinct races in the different districts; in the N. Western provinces, as  I am informed by the Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in  height, whilst in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In  Europe, Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been known to  cross with the wild native species;[146] and in Hindostan an accurate  observer,[147] Sir Walter Elliot, after describing the differences between  wild Indian and wild German boars, remarks that \"the same differences are  perceptible in the domesticated {67} individuals of the two countries.\" We  may therefore conclude that the breeds of the _Sus scrofa_ type have either  descended from, or been modified by crossing with, forms which may be  ranked as geographical races, but which are, according to some naturalists,  distinct species.    Pigs of the _Sus Indica_ type are best known to Englishmen under the form  of the Chinese breed. The skull of _S. Indica_, as described by Nathusius,  differs from that of _S. scrofa_ in several minor respects, as in its  greater breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the  shortness of the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore part of  the palate-bones, and in the divergence of the premolar teeth. It deserves  especial notice that these latter characters are not gained, even in the  least degree, by the domesticated forms of _S. scrofa_. After reading the  remarks and descriptions given by Nathusius, it seems to me to be merely  playing with words to doubt whether _S. Indica_ ought to be ranked as a  species; for the above-specified differences are more strongly marked than  any that can be pointed out between, for instance, the fox and the wolf, or  the ass and the horse. As already stated, _S. Indica_ is not known in a  wild state; but its domesticated forms, according to Nathusius, come near  to _S. vittatus_ of Java and some allied species. A pig found wild in the  Aru islands (Schweineschaedel, s. 169) is apparently identical with _S.  Indica_; but it is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal. The  domesticated breeds of China, Cochin-China, and Siam belong to this type.  The Roman or Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and the  \"Krause\" swine of Nathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and Turkey,  and having fine curly hair, and the small Swiss \"Buendtnerschwein\" of  Ruetimeyer, all agree in their more important skull characters with _S.  Indica_, and, as is supposed, have all been largely crossed with this form.  Pigs of this type have existed during a long period on the shores of the  Mediterranean, for a figure (Schweineschaedel, s. 142) closely resembling  the existing Neapolitan pig has been found in the buried city of  Herculaneum.    Ruetimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived  contemporaneously in Switzerland, during the later Stone or Neolithic  period, two domesticated forms, the _S. scrofa_, and {68} the _S. scrofa  palustris_ or Torfschwein. Ruetimeyer perceived that the latter approached  the Eastern breeds, and, according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs to  the _S. Indica_ group; but Ruetimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs  in some well-marked characters. This author was formerly convinced that his  Torfschwein existed as a wild animal during the first part of the Stone  period, and was domesticated during a later part of the same period.[148]  Nathusius, whilst he fully admits the curious fact first observed by  Ruetimeyer, that the bones of domesticated and wild animals can be  distinguished by their different aspect, yet, from special difficulties in  the case of the bones of the pig (Schweineschaedel, s. 147), is not  convinced of the truth of this conclusion; and Ruetimeyer himself seems now  to feel some doubt. As the Torfschwein was domesticated at so early a  period, and as its remains have been found in several parts of Europe,  belonging to various historic and prehistoric ages,[149] and as closely  allied forms still exist in Hungary and on the shores of the Mediterranean,  one is led to suspect that the wild _S. Indica_ formerly ranged from Europe  to China, in the same manner as _S. scrofa_ now ranges from Europe to  Hindostan. Or, as Ruetimeyer apparently suspects, a third allied species may  formerly have lived in Europe and Eastern Asia.    Several breeds, differing in the proportions of the body, in the length of  the ears, in the nature of the hair, in colour, &c., come under the _S.  Indica_ type. Nor is this surprising, considering how ancient the  domestication of this form has been both in Europe and in China. In this  latter country the date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar[150] to  go back at least 4900 years from the present time. This same scholar  alludes to the existence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and  at the present time the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and  tending their pigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to  place.[151] Hence the Chinese breed, as Nathusius has remarked,[152]  displays in an eminent degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race,  and hence, no doubt, its {69} high value in the improvement of our European  breeds. Nathusius makes a remarkable statement (Schweineschaedel, s. 138),  that the infusion of the 1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part of the blood  of _S. Indica_ into a breed of _S. scrofa_, is sufficient plainly to modify  the skull of the latter species. This singular fact may perhaps be  accounted for by several of the chief distinctive characters of _S.  Indica_, such as the shortness of the lachrymal bones, &c., being common to  several of the species of the genus; for in crosses the characters which  are common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those  appertaining to only a few species.    The Japan pig (_S. pliciceps_ of Gray), which has been recently exhibited  in the Zoological Gardens, has an extraordinary appearance from its short  head, broad forehead and nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin.  The following woodcut is copied from that given by Mr. Bartlett.[153] Not  only {70} is the face furrowed, but thick folds of skin, which are harder  than the other parts, almost like the plates on the Indian rhinoceros, hang  about the shoulders and rump. It is coloured black, with white feet, and  breeds true. That it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt;  and this might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not  longitudinally striped; for this is a character common to all the species  included within the genus _Sus_ and the allied genera whilst in their  natural state.[154] Dr. Gray[155] has described the skull of this animal,  which he ranks not only as a distinct species, but places it in a distinct  section of the genus. Nathusius, however, after his careful study of the  whole group, states positively (Schweineschaedel, s. 153-158) that the skull  in all"]]]
