These are the problems of the  infinitesimal, the infinite, and continuity. To state clearly the  difficulties involved, was to accomplish perhaps the hardest part of  the philosopher's task. This was done by Zeno. From him to our own  day, the finest intellects of each generation in turn attacked the  problems, but achieved, broadly speaking, nothing. In our own time,  however, three men--Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor--have not merely  advanced the three problems, but have completely solved them. The  solutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to  leave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty. This achievement is  probably the greatest of which our age has to boast; and I know of no  age (except perhaps the golden age of Greece) which has a more  convincing proof to offer of the transcendent genius of its great men.  Of the three problems, that of the infinitesimal was solved by  Weierstrass; the solution of the other two was begun by Dedekind, and  definitively accomplished by Cantor.    The infinitesimal played formerly a great part in mathematics. It was  introduced by the Greeks, who regarded a circle as differing  infinitesimally from a polygon with a very large number of very small  equal sides. It gradually grew in importance, until, when Leibniz  invented the Infinitesimal Calculus, it seemed to become the  fundamental notion of all higher mathematics. Carlyle tells, in his  _Frederick the Great_, how Leibniz used to discourse to Queen Sophia  Charlotte of Prussia concerning the infinitely little, and how she  would reply that on that subject she needed no instruction--the  behaviour of courtiers had made her thoroughly familiar with it. But  philosophers and mathematicians--who for the most part had less  acquaintance with courts--continued to discuss this topic, though  without making any advance. The Calculus required continuity, and  continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody  could discover what the infinitely little might be. It was plainly not  quite zero, because a sufficiently large number of infinitesimals,  added together, were seen to make up a finite whole. But nobody could  point out any fraction which was not zero, and yet not finite. Thus  there was a deadlock. But at last Weierstrass discovered that the  infinitesimal was not needed at all, and that everything could be  accomplished without it. Thus there was no longer any need to suppose  that there was such a thing. Nowadays, therefore, mathematicians are  more dignified than Leibniz: instead of talking about the infinitely  small, they talk about the infinitely great--a subject which, however  appropriate to monarchs, seems, unfortunately, to interest them even  less than the infinitely little interested the monarchs to whom  Leibniz discoursed.    The banishment of the infinitesimal has all sorts of odd consequences,  to which one has to become gradually accustomed. For example, there is  no such thing as the next moment. The interval between one moment and  the next would have to be infinitesimal, since, if we take two moments  with a finite interval between them, there are always other moments in  the interval. Thus if there are to be no infinitesimals, no two  moments are quite consecutive, but there are always other moments  between any two. Hence there must be an infinite number of moments  between any two; because if there were a finite number one would be  nearest the first of the two moments, and therefore next to it. This  might be thought to be a difficulty; but, as a matter of fact, it is  here that the philosophy of the infinite comes in, and makes all  straight.    The same sort of thing happens in space. If any piece of matter be cut  in two, and then each part be halved, and so on, the bits will become  smaller and smaller, and can theoretically be made as small as we  please. However small they may be, they can still be cut up and made  smaller still. But they will always have _some_ finite size, however  small they may be. We never reach the infinitesimal in this way, and  no finite number of divisions will bring us to points. Nevertheless  there _are_ points, only these are not to be reached by successive  divisions. Here again, the philosophy of the infinite shows us how  this is possible, and why points are not infinitesimal lengths.    As regards motion and change, we get similarly curious results. People  used to think that when a thing changes, it must be in a state of  change, and that when a thing moves, it is in a state of motion. This  is now known to be a mistake. When a body moves, all that can be said  is that it is in one place at one time and in another at another. We  must not say that it will be in a neighbouring place at the next  instant, since there is no next instant. Philosophers often tell us  that when a body is in motion, it changes its position within the  instant. To this view Zeno long ago made the fatal retort that every  body always is where it is; but a retort so simple and brief was not  of the kind to which philosophers are accustomed to give weight, and  they have continued down to our own day to repeat the same phrases  which roused the Eleatic's destructive ardour. It was only recently  that it became possible to explain motion in detail in accordance with  Zeno's platitude, and in opposition to the philosopher's paradox. We  may now at last indulge the comfortable belief that a body in motion  is just as truly where it is as a body at rest. Motion consists merely  in the fact that bodies are sometimes in one place and sometimes in  another, and that they are at intermediate places at intermediate  times. Only those who have waded through the quagmire of philosophic  speculation on this subject can realise what a liberation from antique  prejudices is involved in this simple and straightforward commonplace.    The philosophy of the infinitesimal, as we have just seen, is mainly  negative. People used to believe in it, and now they have found out  their mistake. The philosophy of the infinite, on the other hand, is  wholly positive. It was formerly supposed that infinite numbers, and  the mathematical infinite generally, were self-contradictory. But as  it was obvious that there were infinities--for example, the number of  numbers--the contradictions of infinity seemed unavoidable, and  philosophy seemed to have wandered into a \"cul-de-sac.\" This  difficulty led to Kant's antinomies, and hence, more or less  indirectly, to much of Hegel's dialectic method. Almost all current  philosophy is upset by the fact (of which very few philosophers are as  yet aware) that all the ancient and respectable contradictions in the  notion of the infinite have been once for all disposed of. The method  by which this has been done is most interesting and instructive. In  the first place, though people had talked glibly about infinity ever  since the beginnings of Greek thought, nobody had ever thought of  asking, What is infinity? If any philosopher had been asked for a  definition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible  rigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a  definition that had any meaning at all. Twenty years ago, roughly  speaking, Dedekind and Cantor asked this question, and, what is more  remarkable, they answered it. They found, that is to say, a perfectly  precise definition of an infinite number or an infinite collection of  things. This was the first and perhaps the greatest step. It then  remained to examine the supposed contradictions in this notion. Here  Cantor proceeded in the only proper way. He took pairs of  contradictory propositions, in which both sides of the contradiction  would be usually regarded as demonstrable, and he strictly examined  the supposed proofs. He found that all proofs adverse to infinity  involved a certain principle, at first sight obviously true, but  destructive, in its consequences, of almost all mathematics. The  proofs favourable to infinity, on the other hand, involved no  principle that had evil consequences. It thus appeared that common  sense had allowed itself to be taken in by a specious maxim, and that,  when once this maxim was rejected, all went well.    The maxim in question is, that if one collection is part of another,  the one which is a part has fewer terms than the one of which it is a  part. This maxim is true of finite numbers. For example, Englishmen  are only some among Europeans, and there are fewer Englishmen than  Europeans. But when we come to infinite numbers, this is no longer  true. This breakdown of the maxim gives us the precise definition of  infinity. A collection of terms is infinite when it contains as parts  other collections which have just as many terms as it has. If you can  take away some of the terms of a collection, without diminishing the  number of terms, then there are an infinite number of terms in the  collection. For example, there are just as many even numbers as there  are numbers altogether, since every number can be doubled. This may be  seen by putting odd and even numbers together in one row, and even  numbers alone in a row below:--              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _ad infinitum_.            2, 4, 6, 8, 10, _ad infinitum_.    There are obviously just as many numbers in the row below as in the  row above, because there is one below for each one above. This  property, which was formerly thought to be a contradiction, is now  transformed into a harmless definition of infinity, and shows, in the  above case, that the number of finite numbers is infinite.    But the uninitiated may wonder how it is possible to deal with a  number which cannot be counted. It is impossible to count up _all_ the  numbers, one by one, because, however many we may count, there are  always more to follow. The fact is that counting is a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#16)"],[1,", while, after a little searching about  for a keyhole, Ben said, with a grunt--    \"Forgot!  There aren't no key to this.  It's fastened with these two  wooden bars.\"    \"I thought they were part of the door, Ben,\" said Roy, in the same  suppressed tone.    \"So did I, sir, at first.  I ought to have remembered, and I think I do  now.  Yes! that's the way; they turn on pins in the middle like wooden  buttons, and you turns one up and the other down out of the notches they  fit in, and then push the door, which has stone hinges.\"    As he spoke, Ben turned the two great wooden bars, and then pressed upon  the door.    \"Hope the stones won't strike a light, sir,\" said Ben, in a low growl.    Roy felt as if a hand had suddenly compressed his heart, and he peered  wildly through the door-way, half expecting to see a tiny spark or two,  as a dull, grating sound arose; but the only sparks the door made were  those glittering in his own eyes, and he drew a deeper, harder breath as  the door ceased to move.    \"Now, we've got to be careful, or we shall be hitting against one  another, sir!  Let me see: there's one step down, and then you're in a  place like a dairy, with two sets of stone shelves,--one just above the  floor, to keep it out of the damp; the other just about as high as a  man's breast,--and there's kegs of powder piled-up on them all.  You  stand still, and I'll go in.\"    \"No; let me,\" said Roy, though why he said this puzzled the boy himself,  when the exciting minutes had passed.    \"Well, sir, you're master, and if you'd rather, of course you can.  But  I don't mind going if you like.\"    \"I'll go,\" said Roy, huskily, and, stretching out his hands in the now  profound darkness, he felt for and touched the side of the entrance,  then made a step forward to place his stockinged foot down upon the cold  stone floor, which struck up like ice.  Bringing forward his second  foot, he reached out for the side of the vault, and found the place just  as his companion had described, for his hands came in contact with small  wooden barrels, neatly piled one upon the other on a great stone shelf,  beneath which was another shelf laden in a similar way.    \"Feel anything, sir?\" said Ben, from the entrance.    \"Yes: barrels, numbers of them,\" said Roy, huskily, his voice sounding a  mere whisper in the darkness.  \"They go on--yes, to here.  It is only a  small vault.\"    \"Yes, sir, but big enough.  Try the other side now.\"    Three steps took Roy there, and his hands touched barrels again piled-up  in the same way, and he whispered his experience.    \"That's it, sir; just what I thought.  But what we want to know now is,  are they full?  Would you mind lifting one, or shall I come and do it?\"    Roy shuddered a little, but he did not shrink.  Stretching out his  hands, he took a careful hold of one of the kegs, raised it to find it  fairly heavy, and then replaced it.    \"Try another, sir.\"    Roy felt less compunction in lifting the second, and this being  replaced, he began to sound others with his knuckles, to find that they  all gave forth the same dull dead note.    \"That's all we want to know down here, Master Roy,\" said the old soldier  at last; \"and now I think we'd better get back and take a couple of the  little kegs with us.  I'd take one from each side, sir.  You pass 'em to  me and I'll carry 'em up safely.  It wouldn't do to drop one in case it  should go off.\"    These words, lightly spoken, made Roy thrill as he lifted down one of  the kegs, getting his fingers tightly fitted to the ends, and then stood  there in the black darkness, afraid to stir for fear he should strike  his elbow against anything and jerk the keg to the floor.    \"Got him, sir?\"    \"Yes,\" said Roy, hoarsely.  \"Whereabouts are you?\"    \"Here, just at the door, sir; I haven't moved,\" was the reply.    \"Reach out your hands, then, and take hold very carefully.  Tell me when  you've got it tight.\"    \"Tight hold,\" said Ben, the next moment.    \"Sure?\"    \"Yes, sir; let it go, and I'll carry it up.\"    Roy quitted his hold of the keg unwillingly, and his heart beat  violently as he listened to the soft _pat, pat_, of his companion's  feet, and thought of the consequences of a fall.  Possibly one vivid  flash and the whole place destroyed; and yet for years they had all been  living so close to this terribly destructive power.    \"If Ben should drop that keg!\"    But Ben only set it down quietly a short distance from the top of the  steps and descended.    \"T'other one, sir, please,\" he said; and Roy placed this in the man's  hands with the same shrinking feeling of reluctance.    It was carried up, and Roy stepped out, drawing the door after him, and  after a few trials managing to close the two bars which secured the  place.    \"Don't want no help there, sir?\"    \"No; I have done it,\" was the reply; and Roy ascended the steps and  waited for his companion to close the stone trap.    \"Not a bad hole this to shut any one up in if we ever wanted to get rid  of him, eh?  He'd have to shout pretty hard to make any one hear.\"    \"Don't talk; let's get away from the dreadful place,\" said Roy, whose  face was wet with perspiration.  \"Can you carry both kegs?\"    \"Half a dozen if you'd range 'em, sir,\" replied Ben.    \"Then I'll fasten the doors after us; and, mind this, the magazine must  always be most carefully locked up.\"    \"You trust me for that, sir!\" replied Ben.  \"I know too well what powder  can do to try any tricks or trust anybody with it but myself.  Why, do  you know, sir, what would happen if I gave a fellow like Tom Rogers a  keg to carry?\"    \"No; how can I tell?\" said Roy, shortly.    \"Well, I can, sir: he'd set it up on end, sit upon it, and take out a  flint and steel to light his pipe as like as not.\"    \"Don't talk any more, please, Ben,\" said the boy as he proceeded to lock  one of the doors.    \"No, sir; I only did it so as to keep you from thinking about what we've  been doing.  I suppose one would get used to it, but it does seem to me  rather ugly work even to an old soldier.\"    \"Where are we to put these two kegs?\" said Roy.    \"In the big closet in the armoury, sir,\" replied Ben.  \"Don't you fidget  about them; they shall be all right, for that's my part of the place,  and nobody goes in there without my leave.\"    \"It's impossible to help feeling a little uncomfortable about them, Ben,  but I know you'll take care.\"    \"I just think I will, sir.  I'm very particular about no harm coming to  Sergeant Benjamin Martlet; and as to doing anything that might mean  risks for my lady--but there, I needn't say nothing about that.  You can  come and see me put 'em away.\"    Roy insisted upon carrying one of the kegs, in spite of the old  soldier's opposition, not to relieve him of the load, but as a lesson to  himself in the art of getting used to the dangerous composition.  In  addition, it had occurred to him that he should have to be present when  the barrels were opened, and the gun or guns fired to test their utility  and strength after lying by for so many years.  Roy had never even heard  a big gun fired, and he told himself that it would not do for him to  display the slightest dread before the men.    Consequently he hid his nervousness, and helped to deposit the kegs in  the great cupboard which contained Ben's tools and cleaning apparatus.    \"There!\" said that individual, \"as soon as we've had our parade, and  dismissed the troops, we'll see to that powder, and find out what it's  like.\"    He thrust the key into his pocket, buckled on his sword again, and,  drawing himself up, asked the \"captain\" to lead the way to the entrance  gate.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    MASTER PAWSON GIVES HIS OPINIONS.    \"You're quite turning everything into military style, Ben,\" said Roy, as  they left the armoury.    \"Yes, sir; nothing like it.  Keep the men up to the mark.\"    \"But isn't it comic to speak of the people as the troops?\"    \"No, sir; not a bit.  Troops are troops whether there's many or few.  It's serious work is fighting, and, with due respect to you, sir,  there's nothing comic in treating our new levies as if they were  seasoned men.\"    All the same, though, Roy felt that he could not agree with his  companion, when they reached the great gate-way, now, for the time  being, made the parade ground.  To his eyes the aspect of the place was  decidedly comic, and his first impulse upon seeing the familiar figures  of butler, footman, grooms, and gardeners, looking stiff and awkward in  their heavy buff coats, creased and angular for want of use, was to  burst out laughing.    But he did not even smile, for he could see that the men were glancing  at him consciously, and he knew that any such display of mirth at their  personal appearance would have had a most disastrous effect.  As it was,  he behaved very wisely, for when Ben shouted out an order for them to  fall into line, Roy advanced to the men at once with a few encouraging  remarks.    \"The accoutrements and things have been lying by so long,\" he said,  \"that they must be very uncomfortable and stiff.\"    \"Yes, sir, they really are,\" said the butler, shaking his head.  \"You  feel as if you can't move in them; and my steel cap is terribly heavy.\"    \"You'll find them grow more easy to wear after a bit,\" said Roy, at a  venture.  \"I see you are pretty well fitted, and--What's that, Ben?\"    For voices came from the gate-way beyond the drawbridge, a hundred yards  from where they were standing.    \"I'll see, sir,\" said Ben, importantly, as he drew himself to the  salute.  \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he added in a low tone; \"be better now if  you'd make everything soldierly and speak to me as sergeant.  Don't see  why my old rank shouldn't tell now, and it will help me with the three  troopers, for one of 'em's a corporal.\"    Roy nodded, and directly after followed his sergeant, for he began to  have an inkling of what was going on.    As he crossed the drawbridge, it "]]]
