With muriatic  acid, the direct reverse takes place; an additional saturation with  oxygen renders it more volatile, of a more penetrating odour, less  miscible with water, and diminishes its acid properties. We were at  first inclined to have denominated these two degrees of saturation in  the same manner as we had done with the acid of sulphur, calling the  less oxygenated _muriatous acid_, and that which is more saturated with  oxygen _muriatic acid_: But, as this latter gives very particular  results in its combinations, and as nothing analogous to it is yet known  in chemistry, we have left the name of muriatic acid to the less  saturated, and give the latter the more compounded appellation of  _oxygenated muriatic acid_.    Although the base or radical of the acid which is extracted from nitre  or saltpetre be better known, we have judged proper only to modify its  name in the same manner with that of the muriatic acid. It is drawn from  nitre, by the intervention of sulphuric acid, by a process similar to  that described for extracting the muriatic acid, and by means of the  same apparatus (Pl. IV. Fig. 1.). In proportion as the acid passes over,  it is in part condensed in the baloon or recipient, and the rest is  absorbed by the water contained in the bottles L,L,L,L; the water  becomes first green, then blue, and at last yellow, in proportion to  the concentration of the acid. During this operation, a large quantity  of oxygen gas, mixed with a small proportion of azotic gas, is  disengaged.    This acid, like all others, is composed of oxygen, united to an  acidifiable base, and is even the first acid in which the existence of  oxygen was well ascertained. Its two constituent elements are but weakly  united, and are easily separated, by presenting any substance with which  oxygen has a stronger affinity than with the acidifiable base peculiar  to this acid. By some experiments of this kind, it was first discovered  that azote, or the base of mephitis or azotic gas, constituted its  acidifiable base or radical; and consequently that the acid of nitre was  really an azotic acid, having azote for its base, combined with oxygen.  For these reasons, that we might be consistent with our principles, it  appeared necessary, either to call the acid by the name of _azotic_, or  to name the base _nitric radical_; but from either of these we were  dissuaded, by the following considerations. In the _first_ place, it  seemed difficult to change the name of nitre or saltpetre, which has  been universally adopted in society, in manufactures, and in chemistry;  and, on the other hand, azote having been discovered by Mr Berthollet to  be the base of volatile alkali, or ammoniac, as well as of this acid,  we thought it improper to call it nitric radical. We have therefore  continued the term of azote to the base of that part of atmospheric air  which is likewise the nitric and ammoniacal radical; and we have named  the acid of nitre, in its lower and higher degrees of oxygenation,  _nitrous acid_ in the former, and _nitric acid_ in the latter state;  thus preserving its former appellation properly modified.    Several very respectable chemists have disapproved of this deference for  the old terms, and wished us to have persevered in perfecting a new  chemical language, without paying any respect for ancient usage; so  that, by thus steering a kind of middle course, we have exposed  ourselves to the censures of one sect of chemists, and to the  expostulations of the opposite party.    The acid of nitre is susceptible of assuming a great number of separate  states, depending upon its degree of oxygenation, or upon the  proportions in which azote and oxygen enter into its composition. By a  first or lowest degree of oxygenation, it forms a particular species of  gas, which we shall continue to name _nitrous gas_; this is composed  nearly of two parts, by weight, of oxygen combined with one part of  azote; and in this state it is not miscible with water. In this gas, the  azote is by no means saturated with oxygen, but, on the contrary, has  still a very great affinity for that element, and even attracts it from  atmospheric air, immediately upon getting into contact with it. This  combination of nitrous gas with atmospheric air has even become one of  the methods for determining the quantity of oxygen contained in air, and  consequently for ascertaining its degree of salubrity.    This addition of oxygen converts the nitrous gas into a powerful acid,  which has a strong affinity with water, and which is itself susceptible  of various additional degrees of oxygenation. When the proportions of  oxygen and azote is below three parts, by weight, of the former, to one  of the latter, the acid is red coloured, and emits copious fumes. In  this state, by the application of a gentle heat, it gives out nitrous  gas; and we term it, in this degree of oxygenation, _nitrous acid_. When  four parts, by weight, of oxygen, are combined with one part of azote,  the acid is clear and colourless, more fixed in the fire than the  nitrous acid, has less odour, and its constituent elements are more  firmly united. This species of acid, in conformity with our principles  of nomenclature, is called _nitric acid_.    Thus, nitric acid is the acid of nitre, surcharged with oxygen; nitrous  acid is the acid of nitre surcharged with azote; or, what is the same  thing, with nitrous gas; and this latter is azote not sufficiently  saturated with oxygen to possess the properties of an acid. To this  degree of oxygenation, we have afterwards, in the course of this work,  given the generical name of _oxyd_[14].    FOOTNOTES:    [12] The term formerly used by the English chemists for this acid was  written _sulphureous_; but we have thought proper to spell it as above,  that it may better conform with the similar terminations of nitrous,  carbonous, &c. to be used hereafter. In general, we have used the  English terminations _ic_ and _ous_ to translate the terms of the Author  which end with _ique_ and _cux_, with hardly any other alterations.--E.    [13] For this purpose, the operation called _decrepitation_ is used,  which consists in subjecting it to nearly a red heat, in a proper  vessel, so as to evaporate all its water of crystallization.--E.    [14] In strict conformity with the principles of the new nomenclature,  but which the Author has given his reasons for deviating from in this  instance, the following ought to have been the terms for azote, in its  several degrees of oxygenation: Azote, azotic gas, (azote combined with  caloric), azotic oxyd gas, nitrous acid, and nitric acid.--E.          CHAP. VII.    _Of the Decomposition of Oxygen Gas by means of Metals, and the  Formation of Metallic Oxyds._      Oxygen has a stronger affinity with metals heated to a certain degree  than with caloric; in consequence of which, all metallic bodies,  excepting gold, silver, and platina, have the property of decomposing  oxygen gas, by attracting its base from the caloric with which it was  combined. We have already shown in what manner this decomposition takes  place, by means of mercury and iron; having observed, that, in the case  of the first, it must be considered as a kind of gradual combustion,  whilst, in the latter, the combustion is extremely rapid, and attended  with a brilliant flame. The use of the heat employed in these operations  is to separate the particles of the metal from each other, and to  diminish their attraction of cohesion or aggregation, or, what is the  same thing, their mutual attraction for each other.    The absolute weight of metallic substances is augmented in proportion to  the quantity of oxygen they absorb; they, at the same time, lose their  metallic splendour, and are reduced into an earthy pulverulent matter.  In this state metals must not be considered as entirely saturated with  oxygen, because their action upon this element is counterbalanced by the  power of affinity between it and caloric. During the calcination of  metals, the oxygen is therefore acted upon by two separate and opposite  powers, that of its attraction for caloric, and that exerted by the  metal, and only tends to unite with the latter in consequence of the  excess of the latter over the former, which is, in general, very  inconsiderable. Wherefore, when metallic substances are oxygenated in  atmospheric air, or in oxygen gas, they are not converted into acids  like sulphur, phosphorus, and charcoal, but are only changed into  intermediate substances, which, though approaching to the nature of  salts, have not acquired all the saline properties. The old chemists  have affixed the name of _calx_ not only to metals in this state, but to  every body which has been long exposed to the action of fire without  being melted. They have converted this word _calx_ into a generical  term, under which they confound calcareous earth, which, from a neutral  salt, which it really was before calcination, has been changed by fire  into an earthy alkali, by _losing_ half of its weight, with metals  which, by the same means, have joined themselves to a new substance,  whose quantity often _exceeds_ half their weight, and by which they  have been changed almost into the nature of acids. This mode of  classifying substances of so very opposite natures, under the same  generic name, would have been quite contrary to our principles of  nomenclature, especially as, by retaining the above term for this state  of metallic substances, we must have conveyed very false ideas of its  nature. We have, therefore,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#16)"],[1,"set up a furious barking, I shrieked, Harris roared; George  waved his hat, and yelled back.  The lock-keeper rushed out with a drag,  under the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock, and appeared  annoyed at finding that no one had.    George had rather a curious oilskin-covered parcel in his hand.  It was  round and flat at one end, with a long straight handle sticking out of  it.    \"What's that?\" said Harris--\"a frying-pan?\"    \"No,\" said George, with a strange, wild look glittering in his eyes;  \"they are all the rage this season; everybody has got them up the river.  It's a banjo.\"    \"I never knew you played the banjo!\" cried Harris and I, in one breath.    \"Not exactly,\" replied George: \"but it's very easy, they tell me; and  I've got the instruction book!\"                         [Picture: George and the banjo]          CHAPTER IX.

We made George work, now we had got him.  He did not want to work, of  course; that goes without saying.  He had had a hard time in the City, so  he explained.  Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to  pity, said:    \"Ah! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change;  change is good for everyone.  Out you get!\"    He could not in conscience--not even George's conscience--object, though  he did suggest that, perhaps, it would be better for him to stop in the  boat, and get tea ready, while Harris and I towed, because getting tea  was such a worrying work, and Harris and I looked tired.  The only reply  we made to this, however, was to pass him over the tow-line, and he took  it, and stepped out.    [Picture: Dog wrapped in tow-line] There is something very strange and  unaccountable about a tow-line.  You roll it up with as much patience and  care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers, and five  minutes afterwards, when you pick it up, it is one ghastly,  soul-revolting tangle.    I do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you took an  average tow-line, and stretched it out straight across the middle of a  field, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that, when you  looked round again, you would find that it had got itself altogether in a  heap in the middle of the field, and had twisted itself up, and tied  itself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it  would take you a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and  swearing all the while, to disentangle it again.    That is my opinion of tow-lines in general.  Of course, there may be  honourable exceptions; I do not say that there are not.  There may be  tow-lines that are a credit to their profession--conscientious,  respectable tow-lines--tow-lines that do not imagine they are  crochet-work, and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the  instant they are left to themselves.  I say there _may_ be such  tow-lines; I sincerely hope there are.  But I have not met with them.    This tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock.  I would not let Harris touch it, because he is careless.  I had looped it  round slowly and cautiously, and tied it up in the middle, and folded it  in two, and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat.  Harris had  lifted it up scientifically, and had put it into George's hand.  George  had taken it firmly, and held it away from him, and had begun to unravel  it as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a new-born infant; and,  before he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing was more like a badly-made  door-mat than anything else.    It is always the same, and the same sort of thing always goes on in  connection with it.  The man on the bank, who is trying to disentangle  it, thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up; and when a  man up the river thinks a thing, he says it.    \"What have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-net of it?  You've made a nice mess you have; why couldn't you wind it up properly,  you silly dummy?\" he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with  it, and lays it out flat on the tow-path, and runs round and round it,  trying to find the end.    On the other hand, the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of the  muddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it.    \"It was all right when you took it!\" he exclaims indignantly.  \"Why don't  you think what you are doing?  You go about things in such a slap-dash  style.  You'd get a scaffolding pole entangled _you_ would!\"    And they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang each  other with the thing.  Ten minutes go by, and the first man gives a yell  and goes mad, and dances on the rope, and tries to pull it straight by  seizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and hauling at it.  Of course, this only gets it into a tighter tangle than ever.  Then the  second man climbs out of the boat and comes to help him, and they get in  each other's way, and hinder one another.  They both get hold of the same  bit of line, and pull at it in opposite directions, and wonder where it  is caught.  In the end, they do get it clear, and then turn round and  find that the boat has drifted off, and is making straight for the weir.    This really happened once to my own knowledge.  It was up by Boveney, one  rather windy morning.  We were pulling down stream, and, as we came round  the bend, we noticed a couple of men on the bank.  They were looking at  each other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable expression as I  have ever witnessed on any human countenance before or since, and they  held a long tow-line between them.  It was clear that something had  happened, so we eased up and asked them what was the matter.    \"Why, our boat's gone off!\" they replied in an indignant tone.  \"We just  got out to disentangle the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was  gone!\"    And they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and  ungrateful act on the part of the boat.    We found the truant for them half a mile further down, held by some  rushes, and we brought it back to them.  I bet they did not give that  boat another chance for a week.    I shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down the  bank with a tow-line, looking for their boat.    One sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with  towing.  One of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers,  walking briskly along, deep in an animated discussion, while the man in  the boat, a hundred yards behind them, is vainly shrieking to them to  stop, and making frantic signs of distress with a scull.  Something has  gone wrong; the rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped  overboard, or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly  down stream.    He calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.    [Picture: Hat in the water] \"Hi! stop a minute, will you?\" he shouts  cheerily.  \"I've dropped my hat over-board.\"    Then: \"Hi!  Tom--Dick! can't you hear?\" not quite so affably this time.    Then: \"Hi!  Confound _you_, you dunder-headed idiots!  Hi! stop!  Oh  you--!\"    After that he springs up, and dances about, and roars himself red in the  face, and curses everything he knows.  And the small boys on the bank  stop and jeer at him, and pitch stones at him as he is pulled along past  them, at the rate of four miles an hour, and can't get out.    Much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would  keep remembering that they are towing, and give a pretty frequent look  round to see how their man is getting on.  It is best to let one person  tow.  When two are doing it, they get chattering, and forget, and the  boat itself, offering, as it does, but little resistance, is of no real  service in reminding them of the fact.    As an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their  work, George told us, later on in the evening, when we were discussing  the subject after supper, of a very curious instance.                    [Picture: Two people towing, boat adrift]    He and three other men, so he said, were sculling a very heavily laden  boat up from Maidenhead one evening, and a little above Cookham lock they  noticed a fellow and a girl, walking along the towpath, both deep in an  apparently interesting and absorbing conversation.  They were carrying a  boat-hook between them, and, attached to the boat-hook was a tow-line,  which trailed behind them, its end in the water.  No boat was near, no  boat was in sight.  There must have been a boat attached to that tow-line  at some time or other, that was certain; but what had become of it, what  ghastly fate had overtaken it, and those who had been left in it, was  buried in mystery.  Whatever the accident may have been, however, it had  in no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman, who were towing.  They  had the boat-hook and they had the line, and that seemed to be all that  they thought necessary to their work.    George was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that moment, a  bright idea flashed across him, and he didn't.  He got the hitcher  instead, and reached over, and drew in the end of the tow-line; and they  made a loop in it, and put it over their mast, and then they tidied up  the sculls, and went and sat down in the stern, and lit their pipes.    And that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a  heavy boat up to Marlow.    George said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one  glance before, as when, at the lock, that young couple grasped the idea  that, for the last two"]]]
