[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1,"date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the  CIA Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs.  Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is  updated more frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much  larger database, and includes all countries.    Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage  data are totaled, as the following two examples show:                      Original Data      Rounded to whole integer    Example 1                43.2                            43                           30.4                            30                           26.4                            26                           ----                            --                          100.0                            99    Example 2                42.8                            43                           31.6                            32                           25.6                            26                           ----                            --                          100.0                           101    When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.    What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus,  for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3,  rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.    Why do you list \"Independence\" dates for countries like France,  Germany, and the United Kingdom?    For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty  was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For  other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood  event such as the traditional founding date or the date of  unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state  succession and so may not strictly be an \"Independence\" date.  Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted  in this same entry.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the  Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible.  We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law  in both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please  use our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem  you are experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that  you are using so that we can work with our technical support staff  to find and implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions  to improve accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.    I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The  Factbook site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.    When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.    When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or  granular, or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.    Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the  title of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages  can be downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in  other applications such as spreadsheets and databases.        =====================================================================        @Afghanistan    Introduction Afghanistan      Background:    Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded    Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the    British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional    British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a    1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union    invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,    touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989    under relentless pressure by internationally supported    anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. Subsequently, a series of civil    wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline    Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the    country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001    terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance    military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN.    The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for    political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new    constitution and a presidential election in 2004, and National    Assembly elections in 2005. On 7 December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became    the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The    National Assembly was inaugurated on 19 December 2005.

Her complexion was pale,  naturally of a rich olive, but now, through sorrow, of a wan and  bloodless hue--still very beautiful, and more appealing than the rosiest  complexion.    Caroline de St. Castin was an Acadienne of ancient and noble family,  whose head and founder, the Baron de St. Castin, had married the  beautiful daughter of the high chief of the Abenaquais.    Her father's house, one of the most considerable in the Colony, had been  the resort of the royal officers, civil and military, serving in Acadia.  Caroline, the only daughter of the noble house, had been reared in  all the refinements and luxuries of the period, as became her rank and  position both in France and her native Province.    In an evil hour for her happiness this beautiful and accomplished girl  met the Chevalier Bigot, who as Chief Commissary of the Army, was one of  the foremost of the royal officers in Acadia.    His ready wit and graceful manners pleased and flattered the susceptible  girl, not used to the seductions of the polished courtesies of the  mother-land of France. She was of a joyous temper--gay, frank, and  confiding. Her father, immersed in public affairs, left her much to  herself, nor, had he known it, would he have disapproved of the gallant  courtesies of the Chevalier Bigot. For the Baron had the soul of honor,  and dreamt every gentleman as well as himself possessed it.    Bigot, to do him justice, felt as sincere a regard for this beautiful,  amiable girl as his nature was capable of entertaining. In rank and  fortune she was more than his equal, and left to himself, he would  willingly have married her. Before he learned that his project of a  marriage in the Colony was scouted at Court he had already offered his  love to Caroline de St. Castin, and won easily the gentle heart that was  but too well disposed to receive his homage.    Her trust went with her love. Earth was never so green, nor air so  sweet, nor skies so bright and azure, as those of Caroline's wooing,  on the shores of the beautiful Bay of Minas. She loved this man with  a passion that filled with ecstasy her whole being. She trusted his  promises as she would have trusted God's. She loved him better than she  loved herself--better than she loved God, or God's law; and counted as  a gain every loss she suffered for his sake, and for the affection she  bore him.    After some months spent in her charming society, a change came over  Bigot. He received formidable missives from his great patroness at  Versailles, the Marquise de Pompadour, who had other matrimonial designs  for him. Bigot was too slavish a courtier to resent her interference,  nor was he honest enough to explain his position to his betrothed. He  deferred his marriage. The exigencies of the war called him away. He had  triumphed over a fond, confiding woman; but he had been trained among  the dissolute spirits of the Regency too thoroughly to feel more than  a passing regret for a woman whom, probably, he loved better than any  other of the victims of his licentious life.    When he finally left Acadia a conquered province in the hands of  the English, he also left behind him the one true, loving heart that  believed in his honor and still prayed for his happiness.    The days of Caroline's disillusion soon came; she could not conceal from  herself that she had been basely deceived and abandoned by the man she  loved so ardently. She learned that Bigot had been elevated to the high  office of Intendant of New France, but felt herself as utterly forgotten  by him as the rose that had bloomed and withered in her garden two  summers ago.    Her father had been summoned to France on the loss of the Colony; and  fearing to face him on his return, Caroline suddenly left her home  and sought refuge in the forest among her far-off kindred, the red  Abenaquais.    The Indians welcomed her with joy and unbounded respect, recognizing  her right to their devotion and obedience. They put upon her feet the  moccasins of their tribe, and sent her, with a trusty escort, through  the wilderness to Quebec, where she hoped to find the Intendant, not to  reproach him for his perfidy,--her gentle heart was too much subdued for  that,--but to claim his protection, and if refused, to die at his door.    It was under such circumstances that the beautiful, highborn Caroline de  St. Castin became an inmate of Beaumanoir. She had passed the night of  this wild debauch in a vigil of prayers, tears, and lamentations over  her sad lot and over the degradation of Bigot by the life which she now  knew he led. Sometimes her maddened fancy was ready to accuse Providence  itself of cruelty and injustice; sometimes, magnifying her own sin, she  was ready to think all earthly punishment upon herself as too light, and  invoked death and judgment as alone adequate to her fault. All night she  had knelt before the altar, asking for mercy and forgiveness,--sometimes  starting to her feet in terror, as a fresh burst of revelry came rushing  from the great hall above, and shook the door of her secret chamber.  But no one came to her help, no one looked in upon her desolation. She  deemed herself utterly forgotten and forsaken of God and man.    Occasionally she fancied she could distinguish the voice of the  Intendant amid the drunken uproar, and she shuddered at the infatuation  which bound her very soul to this man; and yet when she questioned her  heart, she knew that, base as he was, all she had done and suffered for  him she would infallibly do again. Were her life to live over, she would  repeat the fault of loving this false, ungrateful man. The promise  of marriage had been equivalent to marriage in her trust of him, and  nothing but death could now divorce her from him.    Hour after hour passed by, each seeming an age of suffering. Her  feelings were worked up to frenzy: she fancied she heard her father's  angry voice calling her by name, or she heard accusing angels jeering  at her fall. She sank prostrate at last, in the abandonment of despair,  calling upon God to put an end to her miserable life.    Bigot raised her from the floor, with words of pity and sympathy. She  turned on him a look of gratitude which, had he been of stone, he must  have felt. But Bigot's words meant less than she fancied. He was still  too intoxicated to reflect, or to feel shame of his present errand.    \"Caroline!\" said he, \"what do you here? This is the time to make  merry--not to pray! The honorable company in the great hall desire to  pay their respects to the lady of Beaumanoir--come with me!\"    He drew her hand through his arm with a courtly grace that seldom  forsook him, even in his worst moments. Caroline looked at him in a  dazed manner, not comprehending his request. \"Go with you, Francois? You  know I will, but where?\"    \"To the great hall,\" repeated he; \"my worthy guests desire to see you,  and to pay their respects to the fair lady of Beaumanoir.\"    It flashed upon her mind what he wanted. Her womanly pride was outraged  as it had never been before; she withdrew her hand from his arm with  shame and terror stamped on every feature.    \"Go up there! Go to show myself to your guests!\" exclaimed she, with  choking accents, as she stepped back a pace from him. \"Oh, Francois  Bigot, spare me that shame and humiliation! I am, I know, contemptible  beyond human respect, but still--God help me!--I am not so vile as to  be made a spectacle of infamy to those drunken men whom I hear clamoring  for me, even now.\"    \"Pshaw! You think too much of the proprieties, Caroline!\" Bigot felt  sensibly perplexed at the attitude she assumed. \"Why! The fairest dames  of Paris, dressed as Hebes and Ganymedes, thought it a fine jest to wait  on the Regent Duke of Orleans and the Cardinal du Bois in the gay days  of the King's bachelorhood, and they do the same now when the King gets  up one of his great feasts at Choisy; so come, sweetheart--come!\" He  drew her towards the door.    \"Spare me, Francois!\" Caroline knelt at his feet, clasping his hand, and  bathing it in tears--\"Spare me!\" cried she. \"Oh, would to God I had  died ere you came to command me to do what I cannot and will not do,  Francois!\" added she, clasping hard the hand of the Intendant, which she  fancied relaxed somewhat of its iron hardness.    \"I did not come to command you, Caroline, but to bear the request of my  guests. No, I do not even ask you on my account to go up to the great  hall: it is to please my guests only.\" Her tears and heartrending appeal  began to sober him. Bigot had not counted on such a scene as this.    \"Oh, thanks, Francois, for that word! You did not come to command my  obedience in such a shameful thing: you had some small regard left for  the unfortunate Caroline. Say you will not command me to go up there,\"  added she, looking at him with eyes of pitiful pleading, such as no  Italian art ever portrayed on the face of the sorrowing Madonna.    \"No,\" he replied, impatiently. \"It was not I proposed it: it was Cadet.  He is always a fool when the wine overflows, as I am too, or I would not  have hearkened to him! Still, Caroline, I have promised, and my guests  will jeer me finely if I return without you.\" He thought she hesitated a  moment in her resolve at this suggestion. \"Come, for my sake, Caroline!  Do up that disordered hair; I shall be proud of you, my Caroline; there  is not a lady in New France can match you when you look yourself, my  pretty Caroline!\"    \"Francois,\" said she, with a sad smile, \"it is long since you flattered  me thus! But I will arrange my hair for you alone,\" added she, blushing,  as with deft fingers she twisted her raven locks into a coronal about  her head. \"I would once have gone with you to the end of the world to  hear you say you were proud of me. Alas! you can never be proud of me  any more, as in the old happy days at Grand Pre. Those"]]]
