For the Great  Spirit who called them into existence loves _all_ his creatures, even  the meanest and smallest.    Do you believe this? You cannot doubt it, if you have made even a small  progress in the study of Natural history. The Creator's love for every  breathing thing, and provident care for its happiness, must be evident  to all those who pay attention to the works of his hands. What a great  crime, then, shall we be guilty of, if we inflict unnecessary suffering  on any of those creatures he has placed in our power! Creatures beloved  and cared for by God, but so frequently despised and ill-used by us!  Let us think of this, when we are treating any animal unkindly, and  beware lest we \"be found even to _fight against God_,\" by thwarting his  benevolent designs for the happiness of every creature he has sent  forth upon the earth.

But the hole  H here limits the aperture with more advantage, than if the aperture was  placed at the Speculum. If the Instrument be made longer or shorter, the  aperture must be in proportion as the Cube of the square-square Root of  the length, and the magnifying as the aperture. But it's convenient that  the Speculum be an Inch or two broader than the aperture at the least,  and that the Glass of the Speculum be thick, that it bend not in the  working. The Prism EFG must be no bigger than is necessary, and its back  side FG must not be quick-silver'd over. For without quicksilver it will  reflect all the Light incident on it from the Speculum.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.]    In this Instrument the Object will be inverted, but may be erected by  making the square sides FF and EG of the Prism EFG not plane but  spherically convex, that the Rays may cross as well before they come at  it as afterwards between it and the Eye-glass. If it be desired that the  Instrument bear a larger aperture, that may be also done by composing  the Speculum of two Glasses with Water between them.    If the Theory of making Telescopes could at length be fully brought into  Practice, yet there would be certain Bounds beyond which Telescopes  could not perform. For the Air through which we look upon the Stars, is  in a perpetual Tremor; as may be seen by the tremulous Motion of Shadows  cast from high Towers, and by the twinkling of the fix'd Stars. But  these Stars do not twinkle when viewed through Telescopes which have  large apertures. For the Rays of Light which pass through divers parts  of the aperture, tremble each of them apart, and by means of their  various and sometimes contrary Tremors, fall at one and the same time  upon different points in the bottom of the Eye, and their trembling  Motions are too quick and confused to be perceived severally. And all  these illuminated Points constitute one broad lucid Point, composed of  those many trembling Points confusedly and insensibly mixed with one  another by very short and swift Tremors, and thereby cause the Star to  appear broader than it is, and without any trembling of the whole. Long  Telescopes may cause Objects to appear brighter and larger than short  ones can do, but they cannot be so formed as to take away that confusion  of the Rays which arises from the Tremors of the Atmosphere. The only  Remedy is a most serene and quiet Air, such as may perhaps be found on  the tops of the highest Mountains above the grosser Clouds.

I.    _The Phaenomena of Colours in refracted or reflected Light are not caused  by new Modifications of the Light variously impress'd, according to the  various Terminations of the Light and Shadow_.    The PROOF by Experiments.    _Exper._ 1. For if the Sun shine into a very dark Chamber through an  oblong hole F, [in _Fig._ 1.] whose breadth is the sixth or eighth part  of an Inch, or something less; and his beam FH do afterwards pass first  through a very large Prism ABC, distant about 20 Feet from the hole, and  parallel to it, and then (with its white part) through an oblong hole H,  whose breadth is about the fortieth or sixtieth part of an Inch, and  which is made in a black opake Body GI, and placed at the distance of  two or three Feet from the Prism, in a parallel Situation both to the  Prism and to the former hole, and if this white Light thus transmitted  through the hole H, fall afterwards upon a white Paper _pt_, placed  after that hole H, at the distance of three or four Feet from it, and  there paint the usual Colours of the Prism, suppose red at _t_, yellow  at _s_, green at _r_, blue at _q_, and violet at _p_; you may with an  Iron Wire, or any such like slender opake Body, whose breadth is about  the tenth part of an Inch, by intercepting the Rays at _k_, _l_, _m_,  _n_ or _o_, take away any one of the Colours at _t_, _s_, _r_, _q_ or  _p_, whilst the other Colours remain upon the Paper as before; or with  an Obstacle something bigger you may take away any two, or three, or  four Colours together, the rest remaining: So that any one of the  Colours as well as violet may become outmost in the Confine of the  Shadow towards _p_, and any one of them as well as red may become  outmost in the Confine of the Shadow towards _t_, and any one of them  may also border upon the Shadow made within the Colours by the Obstacle  R intercepting some intermediate part of the Light; and, lastly, any one  of them by being left alone, may border upon the Shadow on either hand.  All the Colours have themselves indifferently to any Confines of Shadow,  and therefore the differences of these Colours from one another, do not  arise from the different Confines of Shadow, whereby Light is variously  modified, as has hitherto been the Opinion of Philosophers. In trying  these things 'tis to be observed, that by how much the holes F and H are  narrower, and the Intervals between them and the Prism greater, and the  Chamber darker, by so much the better doth the Experiment succeed;  provided the Light be not so far diminished, but that the Colours at  _pt_ be sufficiently visible. To procure a Prism of solid Glass large  enough for this Experiment will be difficult, and therefore a prismatick  Vessel must be made of polish'd Glass Plates cemented together, and  filled with salt Water or clear Oil.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    _Exper._ 2. The Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through the round  hole F, [in _Fig._ 2.] half an Inch wide, passed first through the Prism  ABC placed at the hole, and then through a Lens PT something more than  four Inches broad, and about eight Feet distant from the Prism, and  thence converged to O the Focus of the Lens distant from it about three  Feet, and there fell upon a white Paper DE. If that Paper was  perpendicular to that Light incident upon it, as 'tis represented in the  posture DE, all the Colours upon it at O appeared white. But if the  Paper being turned about an Axis parallel to the Prism, became very much  inclined to the Light, as 'tis represented in the Positions _de_ and  _[Greek: de]_; the same Light in the one case appeared yellow and red,  in the other blue. Here one and the same part of the Light in one and  the same place, according to the various Inclinations of the Paper,  appeared in one case white, in another yellow or red, in a third blue,  whilst the Confine of Light and shadow, and the Refractions of the Prism  in all these cases remained the same.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    _Exper._ 3. Such another Experiment may be more easily tried as follows.  Let a broad beam of the Sun's Light coming into a dark Chamber through a  hole in the Window-shut be refracted by a large Prism ABC, [in _Fig._  3.] whose refracting Angle C is more than 60 Degrees, and so soon as it  comes out of the Prism, let it fall upon the white Paper DE glewed upon  a stiff Plane; and this Light, when the Paper is perpendicular to it, as  'tis represented in DE, will appear perfectly white upon the Paper; but  when the Paper is very much inclin'd to it in such a manner as to keep  always parallel to the Axis of the Prism, the whiteness of the whole  Light upon the Paper will according to the inclination of the Paper this  way or that way, change either into yellow and red, as in the posture  _de_, or into blue and violet, as in the posture [Greek: de]. And if the  Light before it fall upon the Paper be twice refracted the same way by  two parallel Prisms, these Colours will become the more conspicuous.  Here all the middle parts of the broad beam of white Light which fell  upon the Paper, did without any Confine of Shadow to modify it, become  colour'd all over with one uniform Colour, the Colour being always the  same in the middle of the Paper as at the edges, and this Colour changed  according to the various Obliquity of the reflecting Paper, without any  change in the Refractions or Shadow, or in the Light which fell upon the  Paper. And therefore these Colours are to be derived from some other  Cause than the new Modifications of Light by Refractions and Shadows.    If it be asked, what then is their Cause? I answer, That the Paper in  the posture _de_, being more oblique to the more refrangible Rays than  to the less refrangible ones, is more strongly illuminated by the latter  than by the former, and therefore the less refrangible Rays are  predominant in the reflected Light. And where-ever they are predominant  in any Light, they tinge it with red or yellow, as may in some measure  appear by the first Proposition of the first Part of this Book, and will  more fully appear hereafter. And the contrary happens in the posture of  the Paper [Greek: de], the more refrangible Rays being then predominant  which always tinge Light with blues and violets.    _Exper._ 4. The Colours of Bubbles with which Children play are various,  and change their Situation variously, without any respect to any Confine  or Shadow. If such a Bubble be cover'd with a concave Glass, to keep it  from being agitated by any Wind or Motion of the Air, the Colours will  slowly and regularly change their situation, even whilst the Eye and the  Bubble, and all Bodies which emit any Light, or cast"]]]
