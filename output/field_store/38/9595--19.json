[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#16)"],[1,"afternoon a very  violent storm arose which made the branches of the trees stream out like  wildly disheveled hair, quite turning over those on the windward side,  and emptying the pretty nest of its eggs. In such cases the birds build  anew,--a delay that may bring the incubation into August.    It is a deep, snug, compact nest, with no loose ends hanging, placed in  the fork of a small limb of an apple-tree, a peach-tree, or an  ornamental shade-tree. The eggs are faint bluish-white.    While the female is sitting, the male feeds her regularly. She calls to  him on his approach, or when she hears his voice passing by, in the most  affectionate, feminine, childlike tones, the only case I know where the  sitting bird makes any sound while in the act of incubation. When a  rival male invades the tree, or approaches too near, the male whose nest  it holds pursues and reasons or expostulates with him in the same  bright, amicable, confiding tones. Indeed, most birds make use of their  sweetest notes in war. The song of love is the song of battle too. The  male yellowbirds flit about from point to point, apparently assuring  each other of the highest sentiments of esteem and consideration, at the  same time that one intimates to the other that he is carrying his joke a  little too far. It has the effect of saying with mild and good-humored  surprise, \"Why, my dear sir, this is my territory; you surely do not  mean to trespass; permit me to salute you, and to escort you over the  line.\" Yet the intruder does not always take the hint. Occasionally the  couple have a brief sparring-match in the air, and mount up and up, beak  to beak, to a considerable height, but rarely do they actually come to  blows.    The yellowbird becomes active and conspicuous after the other birds have  nearly all withdrawn from the stage and become silent, their broods  reared and flown. August is his month, his festive season. It is his  turn now. The thistles are ripening their seeds, and his nest is  undisturbed by jay-bird or crow. He is the first bird I hear in the  morning, circling and swinging through the air in that peculiar  undulating flight, and calling out on the downward curve of each stroke,  \"Here we go, here we go!\" Every hour in the day he indulges in his  circling, billowy flight. It is a part of his musical performance. His  course at such times is a deeply undulating line, like the long, gentle  roll of the summer sea, the distance from crest to crest or from valley  to valley being probably thirty feet; this distance is made with but one  brief beating of the wings on the downward curve. As he quickly opens  them, they give him a strong upward impulse, and he describes the long  arc with them closely folded. Thus, falling and recovering, rising and  sinking like dolphins in the sea, he courses through the summer air. In  marked contrast to this feat is his manner of flying when he indulges in  a brief outburst of song on the wing. Now he flies level, with broad  expanded wings nearly as round and as concave as two shells, which beat  the air slowly. The song is the chief matter now, and the wings are used  only to keep him afloat while delivering it. In the other case, the  flight is the main concern, and the voice merely punctuates it.           *       *       *       *       *    Among our familiar birds the matchmaking of none other is quite so  pretty as that of the goldfinch. The goldfinches stay with us in loose  flocks and clad in a dull-olive suit throughout the winter. In May the  males begin to put on their bright summer plumage. This is the result of  a kind of superficial moulting. Their feathers are not shed, but their  dusky covering or overalls are cast off. When the process is only partly  completed, the bird has a smutty, unpresentable appearance. But we  seldom see them at such times. They seem to retire from society. When  the change is complete, and the males have got their bright uniforms of  yellow and black, the courting begins. All the goldfinches of a  neighborhood collect together and hold a sort of musical festival. To  the number of many dozens they may be seen in some large tree, all  singing and calling in the most joyous and vivacious manner. The males  sing, and the females chirp and call. Whether there is actual  competition on a trial of musical abilities of the males before the  females or not, I do not know. The best of feeling seems to pervade the  company; there is no sign of quarreling or fighting; \"all goes merry as  a marriage bell,\" and the matches seem actually to be made during these  musical picnics. Before May is passed the birds are seen in couples, and  in June housekeeping usually begins. This I call the ideal of  love-making among birds, and is in striking contrast to the squabbles  and jealousies of most of our songsters.    I have known the goldfinches to keep up this musical and love-making  festival through three consecutive days of a cold northeast rainstorm.  Bedraggled, but ardent and happy, the birds were not to be dispersed by  wind or weather.          THE HEN-HAWK[1]      August is the month of the high-sailing hawks. The hen-hawk is the most  noticeable. He likes the haze and calm of these long, warm days. He is a  bird of leisure, and seems always at his ease. How beautiful and  majestic are his movements! So self-poised and easy, such an entire  absence of haste, such a magnificent amplitude of circles and spirals,  such a haughty, imperial grace, and, occasionally, such daring aerial  evolutions!    With slow, leisurely movement, rarely vibrating his pinions, he mounts  and mounts in an ascending spiral till he appears a mere speck against  the summer sky; then, if the mood seizes him, with wings half closed,  like a bent bow, he will cleave the air almost perpendicularly, as if  intent on dashing himself to pieces against the earth; but on nearing  the ground he suddenly mounts again on broad, expanded wing, as if  rebounding upon the air, and sails leisurely away. It is the sublimest  feat of the season. One holds his breath till he sees him rise again.    If inclined to a more gradual and less precipitous descent, he fixes  his eye on some distant point in the earth beneath him, and thither  bends his course. He is still almost meteoric in his speed and boldness.  You see his path down the heavens, straight as a line; if near, you hear  the rush of his wings; his shadow hurtles across the fields, and in an  instant you see him quietly perched upon some low tree or decayed stub  in a swamp or meadow, with reminiscences of frogs and mice stirring in  his maw.    When the south wind blows, it is a study to see three or four of these  air-kings at the head of the valley far up toward the mountain,  balancing and oscillating upon the strong current; now quite stationary,  except for a slight tremulous motion like the poise of a rope-dancer,  then rising and falling in long undulations, and seeming to resign  themselves passively to the wind; or, again, sailing high and level far  above the mountain's peak, no bluster and haste, but, as stated,  occasionally a terrible earnestness and speed. Fire at one as he sails  overhead, and, unless wounded badly, he will not change his course or  gait.    The calmness and dignity of this hawk, when attacked by crows or the  kingbird, are well worthy of him. He seldom deigns to notice his noisy  and furious antagonists, but deliberately wheels about in that aerial  spiral, and mounts and mounts till his pursuers grow dizzy and return to  earth again. It is quite original, this mode of getting rid of an  unworthy opponent,--rising to heights where the braggart is dazed and  bewildered and loses his reckoning! I am not sure but it is worthy of  imitation.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] The red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks are both called hen-hawks.          THE RUFFED GROUSE, OR PARTRIDGE      Whir! whir! whir! and a brood of half-grown partridges start up like an  explosion, a few paces from me, and, scattering, disappear into the  bushes on all sides. Let me sit down here behind the screen of ferns and  briers, and hear this wild hen of the woods call together her brood. At  what an early age the partridge flies! Nature seems to concentrate her  energies on the wing, making the safety of the bird a point to be looked  after first; and while the body is covered with down, and no signs of  feathers are visible there, the wing-quills sprout and unfold, and in an  incredibly short time the young make fair headway in flying.    Hark! there arises over there in the brush a soft, persuasive cooing, a  sound so subtle and wild and unobtrusive that it requires the most alert  and watchful ear to hear it. How gentle and solicitous and full of  yearning love! It is the voice of the mother hen. Presently a faint  timid \"Yeap!\" which almost eludes the ear, is heard in various  directions,--the young responding. As no danger seems near, the cooing  of the parent bird is soon a very audible clucking call, and the young  move cautiously in that direction. Let me step never so carefully from  my hiding-place, and all sounds instantly cease, and I search in vain  for either parent or young.    The partridge is one of our native and most characteristic birds. The  woods seem good to be in where I find him. He gives a habitable air to  the forest, and one feels as if the rightful occupant were really at  home. The woods where I do not find him seem to want something, as if  suffering from some neglect of Nature. And then he is such a splendid  success, so hardy and vigorous. I think he enjoys the cold and the snow.  His wings seem to rustle with more fervency in midwinter. If the snow  falls very fast, and promises a heavy storm, he will complacently sit  down and allow himself to be snowed under. When you approach him at such  times, he suddenly bursts out of the snow at your feet, scattering the  flakes in all directions, and goes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#16)"],[1,"my judgment, perhaps yield a lower minimum than has ever yet been  authentically recorded on earth, and it is most unfortunate that the  opportunity was lost. Yet I did not leave my own alcohol minimum--scaled  to 95 deg. below zero, and yielding, by estimation, perhaps ten degrees  below the scaling--there, because of the difficulty of giving explicit  directions that should lead to its ready recovery, and at the close of  such a day of toil as is involved in reaching the summit, men have no  stomach for prolonged search. As will be told, it is cached lower down,  but at a spot where it cannot be missed.    However, for one, the writer was largely unconscious of weariness in  that descent. All the way down, my thoughts were occupied with the  glorious scene my eyes had gazed upon and should gaze upon never again.  In all human probability I would never climb that mountain again; yet if  I climbed it a score more times I would never be likely to repeat such  vision. Commonly, only for a few hours at a time, never for more than a  few days at a time, save in the dead of winter when climbing is out of  the question, does Denali completely unveil himself and dismiss the  clouds from all the earth beneath him. Not for long, with these lofty  colds contiguous, will the vapors of Cook's Inlet and Prince William  Sound and the whole North Pacific Ocean refrain from sweeping upward;  their natural trend is hitherward. As the needle turns to the magnet so  the clouds find an irresistible attraction in this great mountain mass,  and though the inner side of the range be rid of them the sea side is  commonly filled to overflowing.    [Sidenote: The Te Deum]    Only those who have for long years cherished a great and almost  inordinate desire, and have had that desire gratified to the limit of  their expectation, can enter into the deep thankfulness and content that  filled the heart upon the descent of this mountain. There was no pride  of conquest, no trace of that exultation of victory some enjoy upon the  first ascent of a lofty peak, no gloating over good fortune that had  hoisted us a few hundred feet higher than others who had struggled and  been discomfited. Rather was the feeling that a privileged communion  with the high places of the earth had been granted; that not only had we  been permitted to lift up eager eyes to these summits, secret and  solitary since the world began, but to enter boldly upon them, to take  place, as it were, domestically in their hitherto sealed chambers, to  inhabit them, and to cast our eyes down from them, seeing all things as  they spread out from the windows of heaven itself.    Into this strong yet serene emotion, into this reverent elevation of  spirit, came with a shock a recollection of some recent reading.    Oh, wisdom of man and the apparatus of the sciences, the little columns  of mercury that sling up and down, the vacuum boxes that expand and  contract, the hammer that chips the highest rocks, the compass that  takes the bearings of glacier and ridge--all the equipage of hypsometry  and geology and geodesy--how pitifully feeble and childish it seems to  cope with the majesty of the mountains! Take them all together, haul  them up the steep, and as they lie there, read, recorded, and done for,  which shall be more adequate to the whole scene--their records?--or that  simple, ancient hymn, \"We praise Thee, O God!--Heaven and earth are full  of the majesty of Thy Glory!\" What an astonishing thing that, standing  where we stood and seeing what we saw, there are men who should be able  to deduce this law or that from their observation of its working and yet  be unable to see the Lawgiver!--who should be able to push back effect  to immediate cause and yet be blind to the Supreme Cause of All Causes;  who can say, \"This is the glacier's doing and it is marvellous in our  eyes,\" and not see Him \"Who in His Strength setteth fast the mountains  and is girded with power,\" Whose servants the glaciers, the snow, and  the ice are, \"wind and storm fulfilling His Word\"; who exult in the  exercise of their own intelligences and the playthings those  intelligences have constructed and yet deny the Omniscience that endowed  them with some minute fragment of Itself! It was not always so; it was  not so with the really great men who have advanced our knowledge of  nature. But of late years hordes of small men have given themselves up  to the study of the physical sciences without any study preliminary. It  would almost seem nowadays that whoever can sit in the seat of the  scornful may sit in the seat of learning.    [Sidenote: The Scientists]    A good many years ago, on an occasion already referred to, the writer  roamed through the depths of the Grand Canyon with a chance acquaintance  who described himself as \"Herpetologist to the Academy of Sciences\" in  some Western or Mid-Western State, and as this gentleman found the  curious little reptiles he was in search of under a root or in a cranny  of rock he repeated their many-syllabled names. Curious to know what  these names literally meant and whence derived, the writer made inquiry,  sometimes hazarding a conjectural etymology. To his astonishment and  dismay he found this \"scientist,\" whom he had looked up to, entirely  ignorant of the meaning of the terms he employed. They were just  arbitrary terms to him. The little hopping and crawling creatures might  as well have been numbered, or called x, y, z, for any significance  their formidable nomenclature held for him. Yet this man had been keenly  sarcastic about the Noachian deluge and had jeered from the height of  his superiority at hoary records which he knew only at second-hand  reference, and had laid it down that if the human race became extinct  the birds would stand the best chance of \"evolving a primate\"! Since  that time other \"scientists\" have been encountered, with no better  equipment, with no history, no poetry, no philosophy in any broad sense,  men with no letters--illiterate, strictly speaking--yet with all the  dogmatism in the world. Can any one be more dogmatic than your modern  scientist? The reproach has passed altogether to him from the  theologian.    The thing grows, and its menace and scandal grow with it. Since coming  \"outside\" the writer has encountered a professor at a college, a Ph.D.  of a great university, who confessed that he had never heard of certain  immortal characters of Dickens whose names are household words. We shall  have to open Night-Schools for Scientists, where men who have been  deprived of all early advantages may learn the rudiments of English  literature. One wishes that Dickens himself might have dealt with their  pretensions, but they are since his day. And surely it is time some one  started a movement for suppressing illiterate Ph.D.'s.    [Sidenote: The Psalmist and Dr. Johnson]    Of this class, one feels sure, are the scientific heroes of the  sensational articles in the monthly magazines of the baser sort, of  which we picked up a number in the Kantishna on our way to the mountain.  Here, in a picture that seems to have obtruded itself bodily into a page  of letter-press, or else to have suffered the accidental irruption of a  page of letter-press all around it, you shall see a grave scientist  looking anxiously down a very large microscope, and shall read that he  has transferred a kidney from a cat to a dog, and therefore we can no  longer believe in the immortality of the soul; or else that he has  succeeded in artificially fertilizing the ova of a starfish--or was it a  jellyfish?--and therefore there is no God; not just in so many bald  words, of course, but in unmistakable import. Or it may be--so commonly  does the crassest credulity go hand in hand with the blankest  scepticism--he has discovered the germ of old age and is hot upon the  track of another germ that shall destroy it, so that we may all live  virtually as long as we like; which, of course, disposes once for all of  a world to come. The Psalmist was not always complaisant or even  temperate in his language, but he lived a long time ago and must be  pardoned; his curt summary stands: \"Dixit insipiens!\" But the writer  vows that if he were addicted to the pursuit of any branch of physical  knowledge he would insist upon being called by the name of that branch.  He would be a physiologist or a biologist or an anatomist or even a  herpetologist, but none should call him \"scientist.\" As Doll Tearsheet  says in the second part of \"King Henry IV\": \"These villains will make  the word as odious as the word 'occupy'; which was an excellent good  word before it was ill-sorted.\" If Doctor Johnson were compiling an  English dictionary to-day he would define \"scientist\" something thus: \"A  cant name for an experimenter in some department of physical knowledge,  commonly furnished with arrogance and dogmatism, but devoid of real  learning.\"    Here is no gibe at the physical sciences. To sneer at them were just as  foolish as to sneer at religion. What we could do on this expedition in  a \"scientific\" way we did laboriously and zealously. We would never have  thought of attempting the ascent of the mountain without bringing back  whatever little addition to human knowledge was within the scope of our  powers and opportunities. Tatum took rounds of angles, in practice  against the good fortune of a clear day on top, on every possible  occasion. The sole personal credit the present writer takes concerning  the whole enterprise is the packing of that mercurial barometer on his  back, from the Tanana River nearly to the top of the mountain, a point  at which he was compelled to relinquish it to another. He has always had  his opinion about mountain climbers who put an aneroid in their pocket  and go to the top of a great, new peak and come down confidently  announcing its height. But when all this business is done as closely and  carefully as possible, and every"]]]
