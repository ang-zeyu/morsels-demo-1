Finally add to the mixture the  whites of the eggs well beaten. Put in a paper mold greased evenly with  butter, with a thickness of about an inch and bake in a very moderately  hot oven. After baked, cover with a white glaze or frost, made with  powdered sugar, lemon juice and the white of eggs.      197    MACAROONS    (Amaretti)    I      Granulated sugar, nine ounces.    Sweet almonds, three and a half ounces.    Bitter almonds, half of the above quantity.    Whites of egg, two.    Skin and dry the almonds, then chop them very fine. Mix the sugar and  the whites of egg and stir for about half an hour, then add the almonds  to form a rather hard paste. Of this make little balls, as large as a  small walnut. If the paste is too soft add a little butter, if too hard  add a little white of egg, this time beaten. Were it desired to give the  macaroons a brownish color, mix with the paste a little burnt sugar.    As you form the little ball, that you will flatten to the thickness of  one third of an inch, put them over wafers or on pieces of paper or in a  baking tin greased with butter and sprinkled with half flour and half  powdered sugar. Dispose them at a certain distance from one another as  they will enlarge and swell, remaining empty inside.    Bake in an oven moderately hot.    II      Powdered sugar, ten and a half ounces.    Sweet almonds, three ounces.    Bitter almonds, one ounce.    Two whites of egg.    Skin the almonds and dry them in the sun or on the fire, then chop and  grind very fine with one white of egg poured in various times. When this  is done, put half of the sugar, stirring and kneading with your hand.  Then pour everything in a large bowl and, always mixing, add half of the  other white of egg, then the other half of the sugar and finally the  other half of the white.    In this way an homogenous mixture will be obtained of the right  firmness. Shake into a kind of a stick and cut it in rounds all equal,  one third of an inch thick. Take them up one by one with moistened  fingers and make little balls as large as a walnut. Flatten them to the  thickness of a third of an inch and for the rest proceed as said above,  but dust with powdered sugar before putting in a hot oven.    With this dose about thirty macarons can be obtained.      198    FARINA CAKES    (Pasticcini di semolino)      Farina, six and a half ounces.    Sugar, three and a half ounces.    Pine-seeds, two ounces.    Butter, a small piece.    Milk, one quart.    Four eggs.    A pinch of salt.    Taste of lemon peel.    Cook the farina in the milk and when it begins to thicken pour the  pine-seeds, previously chopped fine and pounded with the sugar, then the  butter and the rest, less the eggs which must be put in last when the  mixture has completely cooled. Then place the whole well mixed in little  molds, greased evenly with butter and sprinkled with bread crumbs ground  fine, and bake.      199    RICE TART    (Torta di riso)      Milk, one quart.    Rice, seven ounces.    Sugar, five and a half ounces.    Sweet almonds with four bitter ones, three and a half ounces.    Candied cedar (angelica), one ounce.    Three whole eggs.    Five egg-yolks.    Taste of lemon peel.    A pinch of salt.    Skin the almonds and grind or pound them with two tablespoonfuls of the  sugar.    Cut the candied cedar in very small cubes. Cook the rice in the milk  until it is quite firm, put in all the ingredients except the eggs,  which are added when the mixture is cold. Put the entire mixture in a  baking tin greased with butter and sprinkled with bread crumbs ground  fine, harden in the oven and after 24 hours cut the tart into diamonds.  When serving dust with powdered sugar.      200    FARINA TART    (Torta di semolino)      Milk, one quart.    Farina finely ground, four and a half ounces.    Sugar, four and a half ounces.    Sweet almonds with three bitter, three and a half ounces.    Butter, a small piece.    Four eggs.    Taste of lemon peel.    A pinch of salt.    Skin the almonds in warm water and ground or pound very fine with all  the sugar, to be mixed one tablespoonful at a time.    Cook the farina in the milk and before removing from the fire add the  butter and the almonds, which will dissolve easily, being mixed with the  sugar. Then put the pinch of salt and wait until it becomes lukewarm to  add the eggs that are to be beaten whole previously. Pour the mixture in  a baking tin greased evenly with butter, sprinkled with bread crumbs and  of such a size that the tart has the thickness of an inch or less. Put  it in the oven, remove from the mold when cold and serve whole or cut  into sections.      201    PUDDING OF RICE MEAL    (Budino di farina di riso)      Milk, one quart.    Rice meal, seven ounces.    Sugar, four and a half ounces.    Six eggs.    A pinch of salt.    Taste of vanilla.    First dissolve the rice meal in half a pint of the milk when cold, and  pour it in the rest of the milk when it is boiling. This is done to  prevent the formation of lumps. When the meal is cooked add the sugar,  the butter and the salt. Remove from the fire and when it is lukewarm  mix the eggs (beaten) and the taste of vanilla. Then bake the pudding  like all the others and serve warm.      202    BREAD PUDDING    (Budino di pane)      Soft bread crumb, five ounces.    Butter, three and a half ounces.    Four eggs.    Taste of lemon peel.    A pinch of salt.    Cut the bread crumb into pieces and soak in cold milk. Then rub though a  sieve. Melt the butter in a double boiler (in a vessel immersed in  boiling water) and mix with the eggs until butter and eggs are  incorporated to each other. Add the bread crumb and the sugar and mix  well. Pour the mixture in a mold greased with butter and sprinkled with  bread crumb ground fine and bake like other puddings.      203    POTATO PUDDING    (Budino di patate)      Potatoes, big and mealy, one and a half lb.    Sugar, five and a half ounces.    Butter, one and a half ounces.    Flour, a tablespoonful.    Milk, half a pint.    Six eggs.    A pinch of salt.    Paste of cinnamon or lemon peel.    Boil or steam the potatoes, skin and rub through a sieve. Place them  back again on the fire with the butter, the flour and the milk, all  poured little by little, stirring well with the ladle, then add the  sugar, the salt and the cinnamon or lemon peel (just a taste) and mix  everything together well. Remove from the fire and, when the mixture is  lukewarm or cold add the eggs, first the yolks, then the whites beaten.    Bake like all other puddings and serve hot.      204    LEMON PUDDING    (Budino di limone)      One big lemon.    Sugar, six ounces.    Sweet almonds with 3 bitter ones, six ounces.    Six eggs.    Cook the lemon in water, for which two hours will be enough. Remove dry  and rub through a sieve. Before rubbing, however, taste it, because if  it has a bitter taste it must be kept in cold water until it has lost  that unpleasant taste. Add the sugar, the almonds skinned and ground  very fine and the six yolks of the eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs and  add them to the mixture that will then be put in a mold and baked like  all other puddings.      205    PUDDING OF ROASTED ALMONDS    (Budino di mandorle tostate)      Milk, one quart.    Sugar, three and a half ounces.    Sweet almonds, two ounces.    Lady-finger biscuits, two ounces.    Three eggs.    First prepare the almonds, that is to say skin them in warm water and  toast them on the fire over a plate of iron or a stone, then grind very  fine. Boil the sugar and the lady-fingers, broken in little pieces in  the milk, mixing well. After half an hour of boiling, keeping always  stirred, rub the mixture through a sieve. Then add the toasted and  ground almonds. When it is cold add the beaten eggs, pour it in a smooth  mold, whose bottom will be covered with a film of liquified sugar and  cook in a double boiler, that is to say put the mold well closed in a  kettle full of boiling water.    When cooked let it cool and place in ice-box before serving.      206    CRISP CAKE IN DOUBLE BOILER    (Croccante a bagno maria)      Sugar, five and a half ounces.    Sweet almonds, three ounces.    Egg-yolks, five.    Milk, one pint.    Skin the almonds and chop them in little pieces about as big as a grain  of wheat. Put on the fire two thirds of the sugar and when it is all  melted pour the almonds and stir continually with the ladle until they  have taken the color of cinnamon. Then put them in a tin greased with  butter and when they are cold, pound them very fine with the remaining  third of sugar.    Add the yolks and then the milk, mix well and pour the mixture in a mold  with a hole in the middle and greased evenly with butter. Place the mold  in a double boiler so that it will be cooked by steam.      206    STUFFED PEACHES    (Pesche ripiene)      Six big peaches not very ripe.    Four or five lady-finger biscuits.    Granulated sugar, three ounces.    Two ounces sweet almonds with three peach kernels.    Candied fruit (angelica) half an ounce.    Cut the peaches in two parts, remove the stones and enlarge somewhat the  cavity where they were with the point of a knife. Mix the peach pulp  that you extract with the almonds, already skinned, and grind the pulp  and almonds very fine together with two ounces of the sugar. To this  mixture add the lady-fingers crumbed and the candied fruits. Cut in very  small cubes. This will be the stuffing with which you will fill the  cavities of the twelve halves of peach. These you will place in a row in  a baking tin, with the stuffing above. Add the remaining ounce of sugar  and bake in oven with a moderate fire.      207    MILK GNOCCHI    (Gnocchi di latte)      One quart of milk.    Sugar, nine ounces."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#16)"],[1,"its host.    [Illustration: 93. The Horse Tick.]    Here belongs also the Horse tick (Hippobosca equina, Fig. 93). It is  about the size of the house fly, being black, with yellow spots on the  thorax. Verrill[4] says that \"it attacks by preference those parts where  the hair is thinnest and the skin softest, especially under the belly  and between the hind legs. Its bite causes severe pain, and will  irritate the gentlest horses, often rendering them almost unmanageable,  and causing them to kick dangerously. When found, they cling so firmly  as to be removed with some difficulty, and they are so tough as not to  be readily crushed. If one escapes when captured, it will instantly  return to the horse, or, perchance, to the head of its captor, where it  is an undesirable guest. Another species sometimes infests the ox.\"    [Illustration: 94. Sheep Tick.]    [Illustration: 95. Bat Tick.]    In the wingless Sheep tick (Melophagus ovinus, Fig. 94, with the  pupa-case on the left), the body is wingless and very hairy, and the  proboscis is very long. The young are developed within the body of the  parent, until they attain the pupa state, when she deposits the pupa  case, which is nearly half as large as her abdomen. Other genera are  parasitic on bats; among them are the singular spider-like Bat ticks  (Nycteribia, Fig. 95), which have small bodies and enormous legs, and  are either blind, or provided with four simple eyes. They are of small  size, being only a line or two in length. Such degraded forms of Diptera  have a remarkable resemblance to the spiders, mites, ticks, etc. The  reader should compare the Nycteribia with the young six-footed moose  tick figured farther on. Another spider-like fly is the Chionea valga  (Fig. 96; and 97, larva of the European species), which is a degraded  Tipula, The latter genus standing near the head of the Diptera. The  Chionea, according to Harris, lives in its early, stages in the ground  like many other gnats, and is found early in the spring, sometimes  crawling over the snow. We have also figured and mentioned previously  (page 41) the Bee louse, Braula, another wingless spider-like fly.    [Illustration: 96. Spider fly.]    [Illustration: 97. Larva of Spider fly.]    The Flea is also a wingless fly, and is probably, as has been suggested  by an eminent entomologist, as Baron Osten Sacken informs us, a degraded  genus of the family to which Mycetobia belongs. Its transformations are  very unlike those of the fly ticks, and agree closely with the early  stages of Mycetophila, one of the Tipulid family. In its adult condition  the flea combines the characters of the Diptera, with certain features  of the grasshoppers and cockroaches, and the bugs. The body of the flea  (Fig. 98, greatly magnified; _a_, antennae; _b_, maxillae, and their  palpi, _c_; _d_, mandibles; the latter, with the labium, which is not  shown in the figure, forming the acute beak) is much compressed, and  there are minute wing-pads, instead of wings, present in some species.    [Illustration: 98. Flea, magnified.]    [Illustration: 99. Larva of Flea.]    Dr. G. A. Perkins, of Salem, has succeeded in rearing in considerable  numbers from the eggs, the larvae of this flea. The larvae (Fig. 99, much  enlarged; _a_, antenna; _b_, the terminal segments of the abdomen), when  hatched, are half a line in length. The body is long, cylindrical, and  pure white, with thirteen segments exclusive of the head, and provided  with rather long hairs. It is very active in its movements, and lives on  blood clots, remaining on unswept floors of out-houses, or in the straw  or bed of the animals they infest. In six days after the eggs are laid  the larvae appear, and in a few days after leaving the egg they mature,  spin a rude cocoon, and change to pupae, and the perfect insects appear  in about ten days. A good authority states that the human flea does not  exist in America. We never saw a specimen in this country.    A practical point is how to rid dogs of fleas. As a preventive measure,  we would suggest the frequent sweeping and cleansing of the floors of  their kennels, and renewing the straw or chips composing their  beds,--chips being the best material for them to sleep upon. Flea  afflicted dogs should be washed every few days in strong soapsuds, or  weak tobacco or petroleum water.    A writer in \"Science-Gossip\" recommends the \"use of the Persian Insect  Destroyer, one package of which suffices for a good sized dog. The  powder should be well rubbed in all over the skin, or the dog, if small,  can be put into a bag previously dusted with the powder; in either case  the dog should be washed soon after.\"    [Illustration: 100. Chique.]    One of the most serious insect torments of the tropics of America is the  Sarcopsylla penetrans, called by the natives the Jigger, Chigoe, Bicho,  Chique, or Pique (Fig. 100, enlarged; a, gravid female, natural size).  The female, during the dry season, bores into the feet of the natives,  the operation requiring but a quarter of an hour, usually penetrating  under the nails, and lives there until her body becomes distended with  eggs, the hind-body swelling out to the size of a pea; her presence  often causes distressing sores. The Chigoe lays about sixty eggs,  depositing them in a sort of sac on each side of the external opening of  the oviduct. The young develop and feed upon the swollen body of the  parent flea until they mature, when they leave the body of their host  and escape to the ground. The best preventive is cleanliness and the  constant wearing of shoes or slippers when in the house, and of boots  when out of doors.    [Illustration: The Willow Gall Fly.]      CHAPTER VIII.    THE BORERS OF OUR SHADE TREES.      In no way can the good taste and public spirit of our citizens be better  shown than in the planting of shade trees. Regarded simply from a  commercial point of view one cannot make a more paying investment than  setting out an oak, elm, maple or other shade tree about his premises.  To a second generation it becomes a precious heirloom, and the planter  is duly held in remembrance for those finer qualities of heart and head,  and the wise forethought which prompted a deed simple and natural, but a  deed too often undone. What an increased value does a fine avenue of  shade trees give to real estate in a city? And in the country the single  stately elm rising gracefully and benignantly over the wayside cottage,  year after year like a guardian angel sending down its blessings of  shade, moisture and coolness in times of drought, and shelter from the  pitiless storm, recalls the tenderest associations of generation after  generation that go from the old homestead.    Occasionally the tree, or a number of them, sicken and die, or linger  out a miserable existence, and we naturally after failing to ascribe the  cause to bad soil, want of moisture or adverse atmospheric agencies,  conclude that the tree is infested with insects, especially if the bark  in certain places seems diseased. Often the disease is in streets  lighted by gas, attributed to the leakage of the gas. Such a case has  come up recently at Morristown, New Jersey. An elm was killed by the Elm  borer (Compsidea tridentata), and the owner was on the point of suing  the Gas Company for the loss of the tree from the supposed leakage of a  gas pipe. While the matter was in dispute, a gentleman of that city took  the pains to peel off a piece of the bark and found, as he wrote me,  \"great numbers of the larvae of this beetle in the bark and between the  bark and the wood, while the latter is 'tattooed' with sinuous grooves  in every direction and the tree is completely girdled by them in some  places. There are three different sizes of the larvae, evidently one, two  and three years old, or more properly six, eighteen and thirty months  old.\" The tree had to be cut down.    Dr. Harris, in his \"Treatise on Injurious Insects,\" gives an account of  the ravages of this insect, which we quote: \"On the 19th of June, 1846,  Theophilus Parsons, Esq., sent me some fragments of bark and insects  which were taken by Mr. J. Richardson from the decaying elms on Boston  Common, and among the insects I recognized a pair of these beetles in a  living state. The trees were found to have suffered terribly from the  ravages of these insects. Several of them had already been cut down, as  past recovery; others were in a dying state, and nearly all of them were  more or less affected with disease or premature decay. Their bark was  perforated, to the height of thirty feet from the ground, with numerous  holes, through which insects had escaped; and large pieces had become so  loose, by the undermining of the grubs, as to yield to slight efforts,  and come off in flakes. The inner bark was filled with burrows of the  grubs, great numbers of which, in various stages of growth, together  with some in the pupa state, were found therein; and even the surface of  the wood, in many cases, was furrowed with their irregular tracks. Very  rarely did they seem to have penetrated far into the wood itself; but  their operations were mostly confined to the inner layers of the bark,  which thereby became loosened from the wood beneath. The grubs rarely  exceed three-quarters of an inch in length. They have no feet, and they  resemble the larvae of other species of Saperda, except in being rather  more flattened. They appear to complete their transformations in the  third year of their existence.    \"The beetles probably leave their holes in the bark during the month of  June and in the beginning of July, for, in the course of thirty years, I  have repeatedly taken them at various dates, from the fifth of June to  the tenth of July. It is evident, from the nature and extent of their  depredations, that these insects have alarmingly hastened the decay of  the elm trees on Boston Mall and Common, and that they now threaten"]]]
