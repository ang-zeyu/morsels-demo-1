I thought that ether would evaporate without either the pressure of the  atmosphere being taken away, or heat applied; and that it was for that  reason so necessary to keep it carefully corked up?    MRS. B.    It is true it will evaporate, but without ebullition; what I am now  speaking of is the vaporization of ether, or its conversion into vapour  by boiling. I am going to show you how suddenly the ether in this phial  will be converted into vapour, by means of the air-pump. --Observe with  what rapidity the bubbles ascend, as I take off the pressure of the  atmosphere.    CAROLINE.    It positively boils: how singular to see a liquid boil without heat!    MRS. B.    Now I shall place the phial of ether in this glass, which it nearly  fits, so as to leave only a small space, which I fill with water; and in  this state I put it again under the receiver. (PLATE IV. Fig. 1.)* You  will observe, as I exhaust the air from it, that whilst the ether boils,  the water freezes.        [Footnote *: Two pieces of thin glass tubes, sealed at one end,      might answer this purpose better. The experiment, however, as here      described, is difficult, and requires a very nice apparatus. But      if, instead of phials or tubes, two watch-glasses be used, water      may be frozen almost instantly in the same manner. The two glasses      are placed over one another, with a few drops of water interposed      between them, and the uppermost glass is filled with ether. After      working the pump for a minute or two, the glasses are found to      adhere strongly together, and a thin layer of ice is seen between      them.]    CAROLINE.    It is indeed wonderful to see water freeze in contact with a boiling  fluid!    EMILY.    I am at a loss to conceive how the ether can pass to the state of vapour  without an addition of caloric. Does it not contain more caloric in a  state of vapour, than in a state of liquidity?    MRS. B.    It certainly does; for though it is the pressure of the atmosphere which  condenses it into a liquid, it is by forcing out the caloric that  belongs to it when in an aeriform state.    EMILY.    You have, therefore, two difficulties to explain, Mrs. B. --First, from  whence the ether obtains the caloric necessary to convert it into vapour  when it is relieved from the pressure of the atmosphere; and, secondly,  what is the reason that the water, in which the bottle of ether stands,  is frozen?    CAROLINE.    Now, I think, I can answer both these questions. The ether obtains the  addition of caloric required, from the water in the glass; and the loss  of caloric, which the latter sustains, is the occasion of its freezing.    MRS. B.    You are perfectly right; and if you look at the thermometer which I have  placed in the water, whilst I am working the pump, you will see that  every time bubbles of vapour are produced, the mercury descends; which  proves that the heat of the water diminishes in proportion as the ether  boils.    EMILY.    This I understand now very well; but if the water freezes in consequence  of yielding its caloric to the ether, the equilibrium of heat must, in  this case, be totally destroyed. Yet you have told us, that the exchange  of caloric between two bodies of equal temperature, was always equal;  how, then, is it that the water, which was originally of the same  temperature as the ether, gives out caloric to it, till the water is  frozen, and the ether made to boil?    MRS. B.    I suspected that you would make these objections; and, in order to  remove them, I enclosed two thermometers in the air-pump; one which  stands in the glass of water, the other in the phial of ether; and you  may see that the equilibrium of temperature is not destroyed; for as the  thermometer descends in the water, that in the ether sinks in the same  manner; so that both thermometers indicate the same temperature, though  one of them is in a boiling, the other in a freezing liquid.    EMILY.    The ether, then, becomes colder as it boils? This is so contrary to  common experience, that I confess it astonishes me exceedingly.    CAROLINE.    It is, indeed, a most extraordinary circumstance. But pray, how do you  account for it?    MRS. B.    I cannot satisfy your curiosity at present; for before we can attempt to  explain this apparent paradox, it is necessary to become acquainted with  the subject of LATENT HEAT: and that, I think, we must defer till our  next interview.    CAROLINE.    I believe, Mrs. B., that you are glad to put off the explanation; for it  must be a very difficult point to account for.    MRS. B.    I hope, however, that I shall do it to your complete satisfaction.    EMILY.    But before we part, give me leave to ask you one question. Would not  water, as well as ether, boil with less heat, if deprived of the  pressure of the atmosphere?    MRS. B.    Undoubtedly. You must always recollect that there are two forces to  overcome, in order to make a liquid boil or evaporate; the attraction of  aggregation, and the weight of the atmosphere. On the summit of a high  mountain (as Mr. De Saussure ascertained on Mount Blanc) much less heat  is required to make water boil, than in the plain, where the weight of  the atmosphere is greater.* Indeed if the weight of the atmosphere be  entirely removed by means of a good air-pump, and if water be placed in  the exhausted receiver, it will evaporate so fast, however cold it  maybe, as to give it the appearance of boiling from the surface. But  without the assistance of the air-pump, I can show you a very pretty  experiment, which proves the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere in  this respect.    Observe, that this Florence flask is about half full of water, and the  upper half of invisible vapour, the water being in the act of boiling.  --I take it from the lamp, and cork it carefully--the water, you see,  immediately ceases boiling. --I shall now dip the flask into a bason of  cold water.**        [Footnote *: On the top of Mount Blanc, water boiled when heated      only to 187 degrees, instead of 212 degrees.]        [Footnote **: The same effect may be produced by wrapping a cold      wet linen cloth round the upper part of the flask. In order to      show how much the water cools whilst it is boiling, a thermometer,      graduated on the tube itself, may be introduced into the bottle      through the cork.]    CAROLINE.    But look, Mrs. B., the hot water begins to boil again, although the cold  water must rob it more and more of its caloric! What can be the reason  of that?    MRS. B.    Let us examine its temperature. You see the thermometer immersed in it  remains stationary at 180 degrees, which is about 30 degrees below the  boiling point. When I took the flask from the lamp, I observed to you  that the upper part of it was filled with vapour; this being compelled  to yield its caloric to the cold water, was again condensed into water--  What, then, filled the upper part of the flask?    EMILY.    Nothing; for it was too well corked for the air to gain admittance, and  therefore the upper part of the flask must be a vacuum.    MRS. B.    The water below, therefore, no longer sustains the pressure of the  atmosphere, and will consequently boil at a much lower temperature.  Thus, you see, though it had lost many degrees of heat, it began boiling  again the instant the vacuum was formed above it. The boiling has now  ceased, the temperature of the water being still farther reduced; if it  had been ether, instead of water, it would have continued boiling much  longer, for ether boils, under the usual atmospheric pressure, at a  temperature as low as 100 degrees; and in a vacuum it boils at almost  any temperature; but water being a more dense fluid, requires a more  considerable quantity of caloric to make it evaporate quickly, even when  the pressure of the atmosphere is removed.    EMILY.    What proportion of vapour can the atmosphere contain in a state of  solution?    MRS. B.    I do not know whether it has been exactly ascertained by experiment; but  at any rate this proportion must vary, both according to the temperature  and the weight of the atmosphere; for the lower the temperature, and the  greater the pressure, the smaller must be the proportion of vapour that  the atmosphere can contain.    To conclude the subject of free caloric, I should mention _Ignition_, by  which is meant that emission of light which is produced in bodies at a  very high temperature, and which is the effect of accumulated caloric.    EMILY.    You mean, I suppose, that light which is produced by a burning body?    MRS. B.    No: ignition is quite independent of combustion. Clay, chalk, and indeed  all incombustible substances, may be made red hot. When a body burns,  the light emitted is the effect of a chemical change which takes place,  whilst ignition is the effect of caloric alone, and no other change than  that of temperature is produced in the ignited body.    All solid bodies, and most liquids, are susceptible of ignition, or, in  other words, of being heated so as to become luminous; and it is  remarkable that this takes place pretty nearly at the same temperature  in all bodies, that is, at about 800 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale.    EMILY.    But how can liquids attain so high a temperature, without being  converted into vapour?    MRS. B.    By means of confinement and pressure. Water confined in a strong iron  vessel (called Papin's digester) can have its temperature raised to  upwards of 400 degrees. Sir James Hall has made some very curious  experiments on the effects of heat assisted by pressure; by means of  strong gun-barrels, he succeeded in melting a variety of substances  which were considered as infusible: and it is not unlikely that, by  similar methods, water itself might be heated to redness.

Further, it was on account of some particular plan, in reference to the  management of this description of evidence, I am inclined to think, that  he felt the importance of being present at the trials. For this reason,  he laments the illness that prevented his accompanying Richards to the  Court, at its opening, on the second of June, to \"assist the noble  service,\" as he says, \"with the utmost of my little skill and care.\"    This language shows conclusively, by the way, the great influence he  had, at that time, in directing the Government, particularly the Court.  He would not have addressed one of the Judges, in such terms, had he not  felt that his \"skill and care\" would be recognized and permitted to take  effect. We may well lament, with him, that he could not have been  present at the first trial. It would not, then, have been left to  conjecture and scrutiny, to determine what his plan was; and an open  attempt, to bring the Court to adopt it, might have given another turn  to affairs.    In his Diary, on the twenty-ninth of April, is the following: \"This day  I obtained help of God, that he would make use of me, as of a John, to  be a herald of the Lord's Kingdom, now approaching.\" \"My prayers did  especially insist upon the horrible enchantments and possessions, broke  forth in Salem Village, things of a most prodigious aspect, a good issue  to those things, and my own direction and protection thereabouts, I did  especially petition for.\"    The date of this entry is important. On the eleventh, nineteenth, and  twenty second of April, impressive scenes had been exhibited at Salem  Village. Some of the most conspicuous cases of the preliminary  examinations of persons arrested had occurred. The necessary steps were  then being taken to follow up those examinations with a procedure that  would excite the country to the highest pitch. The arrangements, kept  concealed at Salem, and unsuspected by the public at large, were made  and perfected in Boston. On the day after the date of the foregoing  memorandum, a Magistrate in that place issued the proper order for the  arrest of the Rev. George Burroughs; and officers were started express  to Maine for that purpose. This was \"the most prodigious aspect of  affairs\" at the time. All the circumstances must have been known by  Mather. Hence his earnest solicitude that proceedings should be  conducted under his own \"direction and protection.\" The use of these  terms, looks as if Mather contemplated the preliminary examinations as  to take place under his direction and management, and will be borne in  mind, when we come to consider the question of his having been, more or  less, present at them.    Disposed to take the most favorable and charitable view of such passages  as have now been presented, I would gather from them that his mind may  have recurred to his original and favorite idea, that prayer and fasting  were the proper weapons to wield against witchcraft; but if they failed,  then recourse was to be had to the terrors of the law. He desired to  have the afflicted and the accused placed under the treatment of some  one person, of discretion enough to make no ill use of their  communications, to whom \"they might privately tell their minds,\" and  who, without \"noise, company and openness,\" could keep, under his own  control, the dread secrets of the former and exorcise the latter. He was  willing, and desirous, of occupying this position himself, and of taking  its responsibility. To signify this, he offered to provide \"meat, drink,  and lodging\" for six of the afflicted children; to keep them \"asunder in  the closest privacy;\" to be the recipient of their visions; and then to  look after the accused, for the purpose of inducing them to confess and  break loose from their league with Satan; to be exempt, except when he  thought proper to do it, from giving testimony in Court, against parties  accused; and to communicate with persons, thus secretly complained of,  as he and his father afterwards did with the Secretary of Connecticut,  and taking, as in that case, if he saw fit, a bare denial as sufficient  for \"sheltering\" them, altogether, by keeping the accusation a profound  secret in his own breast, as he acknowledges he had done to a  considerable extent--at once claiming and confessing that he had \"done  so much that way, as to sin in what he had done.\"    In language that indicates a correspondence and familiarity of  intercourse with persons, acting on the spot, at Salem Village, such as  authorized him to speak for them, he gives us to understand that they  concurred with him in his proposed method of treating the cases: \"There  are very worthy men, who, having, been called by God, when and where  this witchcraft first appeared upon the stage, to encounter it, are  earnestly desirous to have it sifted unto the bottom of it.\" \"Persons,  thus disposed, have been men eminent for wisdom and virtue.\" \"They would  gladly contrive and receive an expedient, how the shedding of blood might  be spared, by the recovery of witches not beyond the reach of pardon.  And, after all, they invite all good men, in terms to this purpose.\"  \"Being amazed at the number and quality of those accused, of late, we do  not know but Satan by his wiles may have enwrapt some innocent persons;  and therefore should earnestly and humbly desire the most critical  inquiry, upon the place, to find out the fallacy.\"--_Wonders_, 11.    Indeed, Parris and his coadjutors, at Salem Village, to whom these  passages refer, had, without authority, been, all along, exercising the  functions Mather desired to have bestowed upon him, by authority. They  had kept a controlling communication with the \"afflicted children;\"  determined who were to be cried out publicly against, and when; rebuked  and repressed the calling out, by name, of the Rev. Samuel Willard and  many other persons, of both sexes, of \"quality,\" in Boston; and arranged  and managed matters, generally.    The conjecture I have ventured to make, as to Mather's plan of  procedure, explains, as the reader will perceive, by turning back to the  Minister's _Advice_, [_Pages 21, 22, ante_] much of the phraseology of  that curious document. \"Very critical and exquisite caution,\" in the  _third_ Section; \"that all proceedings thereabout be managed with an  exceeding tenderness towards those that may be complained of,\" in the  _fourth_; \"we could wish that there may be admitted as little as  possible of such noise, company and openness, as may too hastily expose  them that are examined,\" in the _fifth_; and the entire _seventh_  Section, expressly authorize the suppression, disregard, and  _disbelief_, of _some_ of the Devil's accusations, on the grounds of  expediency and public policy.    Mather's necessary absence from the Court, at its first Session,  prevented his \"skill and care\" being availed of, or any attempt being  made to bring forward his plan. The proceedings, having thus commenced  in an ordinary way, were continued at the several adjournments of the  Court; and his experiment was never made.    The fallacy of his ideas and the impracticability of his scheme must,  indeed, have become evident, at the first moment it was brought under  consideration. Inexperienced and blinded, as they were, by the delusions  of the time and the excitements of the scene, and disposed, as they must  have been, by all considerations, to comply with his wishes, the Judges  had sense enough left to see that it would never do to take the course  he desired. The trials could not, in that event, have gone on at all.  The very first step would have been to abrogate their own functions as a  Court; pass the accusers and accused over to his hands; and adjourn to  wait his call. If the spectre evidence had been excluded from the  \"noise, confusion and openness\" of the public Court-room, there would  have been nothing left to go upon. If it had been admitted, under any  conditions or limitations, merely to disclose matter of \"presumption,\" a  fatal difficulty would meet the first step of the enquiry. To the  question, \"Who hurts you?\" no answer could be allowed to be given; and  the \"_Minister_,\" to whom the witness had confidentially given the names  of persons whose spectres had tormented her, sitting, perhaps, in the  Court-room at the time, would have to countenance the suppression of the  evidence, and not be liable to be called to the stand to divulge his  knowledge.    The attempt to leave the accusers and the accused to be treated by the  Minister selected for the purpose, in secure privacy, would have  dissolved the Court before it had begun; and if this was what Mather  meant when, afterwards, at any time, he endeavored to throw off the  responsibility of the proceedings, by intimating that his proffered  suggestions and services were disregarded, his complaint was most  unreasonable. The truth is, the proposal was wholly inadmissible, and  could not have been carried into effect.    Besides, it would have overthrown the whole system of organized society,  and given to whomsoever the management of the cases had thus, for the  time, been relinquished, a power too fearful to be thought of, as lodged  in one man, or in any private person. If he, or any other person, had  been allowed by the Court to assume such an office, and had been known  to hold, in secret custody, the accusing parties, receiving their  confidential communications, to act upon them as he saw fit--sheltering  some from prosecution and returning others to be proceeded against by  the Court, which would be equivalent to a conviction and execution--it  would have inaugurated a reign of terror, such as had not even"]]]
