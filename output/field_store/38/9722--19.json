We were in a section where there was a great deal of laurel and Bruin  continued to make camps but as often would change his mind and move  on and Bill thought he had concluded to go to the can brake in  Virginia. Often when he would go into a wind jam or laurel thicket,  we would separate, one taking a circuit on one side of the thicket,  the other on the other side, meeting on the opposite side from where  the trail had entered but we would always find that Bruin was still  on the go. We were in a locality where there were apparently a good  many deer and we saw signs of marten quite often.    We were now on the head waters of Hunts Run in Cameron county and we  decided to make that section our next hunting ground. While the trail  would wind about some, yet bruin's general course was south. Often  when bruin would vary considerably from his general course and go  into a thicket or wind jam, we would feel sure that this time we  would find him napping, but we were disappointed each time. Once when  we were circling one of these thickets, I drove a deer out and it ran  to Bill who gave him his finish. We were near a lumber camp and sold  it for ten dollars and our night's lodging and some grub. We were now  getting pretty well down to the railroad near Sterling Run. We were  sure that bruin was going to cross the railroad so we left the trail  and went down to the railroad and followed along the road until we  came to the trail.    The bear had crossed the road during the night and no one had noticed  the trail. Here I suggested to Bill that we take a train to Kane and  go to camp and go out and take a wood job, but Bill thought that we  had about all the job on our hands that we were able to attend to. He  was right, for as near as I can remember, the trail led us nearly a  half day's tramp before bruin made a stop. The foot that the trap was  on began to bleed considerably. We began to fear that the foot would  come off and bruin relieved of the trap would escape after all.    We now had some more help, two men took the trail ahead of us  following it until nearly dark when they apparently held a council of  war, judging from the way they tracked about where they left the  trail. We were now in a pine slashing and concluded to camp on the  trail, though we knew that we were not far from a lumber camp as we  could hear men chopping and driving oxen. We were lucky in finding a  good place to camp and water close at hand. As we had a small tin  pail with us and coffee, we made a pail of coffee and ate our lunch  and fixed our bunk, then we sat down before the fire for a time and  talked over what we thought we might do the next day. Then we rolled  up in our blankets and it was time to get the coffee boiling again  before we were hardly aware that we had been asleep.    Bruin now began to act more like a sensible bear and would zigzag  about from one thicket to another. We now got close enough to him so  that we heard him in the brush several times. Bill said that he  thought that bruin was about to make up his mind to let us take off  that handcuff. He proved to be right, for it was not long before  bruin's trail led down onto the side of a steep ravine. The sides  were not more than one hundred yards apart and were quite clear (only  for the piles of pine tree tops) from fallen trees, that had been  taken out for logs.    We were standing a little way down the side of the ravine, laying  plans as to our next move, as we had come to the conclusion that  bruin had either turned down along the side of the ravine or had gone  into camp. We had planned that one would go up around the head of the  ravine while the other waited on the trail until the one that went  around should get on the opposite side. While still laying plans, we  saw bruin come out on the opposite side and began to climb the hill.    We had followed the bear for six days and this was the first time  that we had seen his lordship. He would go a few steps and stop and  look back. We watched our opportunity and when he made a stop, we  both fired. Bruin made a jump or two up the hill then tumbled back  down again and the fun had ended. We took the entrails out and left  him lying across a log and went down the ravine to where there was a  lumber camp and there we found that we were on Dent's Run, a branch  of Bennet's Branch and in Elk county.    This was the fourth county we had been in since we had taken the  bear's trail. They told us at the lumber camp that there would be  three or four teams go down to the railroad station at Driftwood the  next morning with spars which they were hauling to the river to raft.  We got a man with a yoke of oxen and a bobsled to go with us and get  the bear and the next morning about 5 o'clock we got the bear  strapped onto one of the spars and started down the stream to the  railroad and we shipped it, without removing the skin, to New York,  where we got either $26 or $28 for it.    We took the train to Kane where we stayed over night. The next  morning we went to camp and found all well with one exception, that  being, that the shanty was swarming with \"deer mice\" and a porcupine  had tried hard to gnaw his way through the door. The following day we  stayed in camp and rested before starting out to see what would turn  up the next day.    We first looked at the bear traps, tending what small traps came in  on the way. On going the rounds of the bear traps, we found them all  undisturbed except one, which might better have been as it only had a  porcupine in it and we did not see any signs of bear. We began to  think of taking up the bear traps as we thought that bruin had gone  into winter quarters. We did not get around to take them up for  several days, being busy tending the smaller traps.    It was now getting along into December and the snow was quite deep.  We concluded to put in the time hunting deer as we wished to get all  we could, to send out with the team, when we had it come in, as it  did not cost any more to take out a full load than half a load. The  law closed on deer the first of January, although allowing the  hunters 15 days to dispose of his venison after it was unlawful to  kill deer. We hustled from early morning until long after dark, when  we would get to camp and there was hardly a day that we did not kill  at least one deer and some days two or three between us.    I will tell of a little scrape I had one day with a yearling buck  that I thought to be dead. I was following the trail of three or four  deer along the side of a ridge, expecting every moment to catch them  feeding, when I heard a noise behind me and looking back, I saw this  little buck coming full tilt right towards me. The deer saw me about  as soon as I did him and wheeled to run back when I fired and he went  down. I set my gun against a tree and started to cut the deer's  throat. I took the deer by the ear and straightened his back. About  this time that dead deer began to get pretty lively and was trying to  get on his feet and as I could not reach my gun, threw myself onto  him, thinking to hold him down.    Well I held him about as long as lightning would stay on a limb. When  I got through gazing at the hole in the brush where I last saw him, I  found that I was sadly in need of a new pair of trousers and vest, as  well as a jack knife. I searched a long time in hopes of finding the  knife, but did not. I had another knife at camp and after about a two  hour's job with needle and thread, I managed to get the trousers so  that they were passable in a pinch and all the time that I was  repairing the trousers, Bill sat there laughing at me. Now this was  the first time that I had supposed dead deer come to life and give me  the go-by, though it was not the last time.    I had given him what is called a fine shot, that is I had shot him  just across the back and the ball had struck one of the joints or  knuckles of the backbone as it proved. I had the satisfaction of  killing the same deer two or three days later or at least we thought  it was the same one. We had three or four days of mild weather and as  we had not been the rounds of the traps for several days, only  tending those that came handy while hunting deer, we thought we would  reverse the plan and go over all the traps and pay but little  attention to deer hunting unless we struck a hot trail. We thought we  would take in those traps first in the direction where the bear traps  were and go to the traps farthest from camp and bring in some of the  traps. We did not expect to get any more bear as it was too late in  the season for bear to travel until they had their winter's sleep.    We were in luck this time for as we had usually tended the bear  traps, the one that we went to first would have been the last trap to  come to. When we came in sight of where the trap was set we saw that  there had been a bear dance going on. As the snow was several inches  deep, we saw at a glance which way the bear had gone and we only had  to step to the brow of the ridge and look down the hillside a little  way to see bruin fast among some small saplings. He was rolling and  tumbling about trying to release himself.    He looked like a great black ball as he rolled about. We lost no time  in putting him out of his trouble. We skinned the fore parts and hung  them up in a sapling to use for bait for fox and marten and took the  saddles to camp, skinned them out and stretched the skin on the  shanty. Later we shipped the saddles to market.    The next day we looked at the balance of the bear traps but found  them undisturbed but we concluded to leave them set a few days  longer. On going the rounds of the smaller traps, we got a fox or two  also a marten or two, but as I remember it, we got no mink or otter  at this time. We now had the traps all looked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#16)"],[1,"embraces, as  I saw to right and left amber curves and sheeny recesses, shining ridges  and bloomy clefts. The clean delicacy of those sands that, in long  and glowing hills, stretched out from Nubia to meet me, who could ever  describe them? Who could ever describe their soft and enticing shapes,  their exquisite gradations of color, the little shadows in their  hollows, the fiery beauty of their crests, the patterns the cool winds  make upon them? It is an enchanted _royaume_ of the sands through which  one approaches Isis.    Isis and engineers! We English people have effected that curious  introduction, and we greatly pride ourselves upon it. We have presented  Sir William Garstin, and Mr. John Blue, and Mr. Fitz Maurice, and other  clever, hard-working men to the fabled Lady of Philae, and they have  given her a gift: a dam two thousand yards in length, upon which  tourists go smiling on trolleys. Isis has her expensive tribute--it  cost about a million and a half pounds--and no doubt she ought to be  gratified.    Yet I think Isis mourns on altered Philae, as she mourns with her  sister, Nepthys, at the heads of so many mummies of Osirians upon the  walls of Egyptian tombs. And though the fellaheen very rightly rejoice,  there are some unpractical sentimentalists who form a company about  her, and make their plaint with hers--their plaint for the peace that  is gone, for the lost calm, the departed poetry, that once hung, like a  delicious, like an inimitable, atmosphere, about the palms of the \"Holy  Island.\"    I confess that I dreaded to revisit Philae. I had sweet memories of the  island that had been with me for many years--memories of still mornings  under the palm-trees, watching the gliding waters of the river, or  gazing across them to the long sweep of the empty sands; memories of  drowsy, golden noons, when the bright world seemed softly sleeping, and  the almost daffodil-colored temple dreamed under the quivering canopy of  blue; memories of evenings when a benediction from the lifted hands  of Romance surely fell upon the temple and the island and the river;  memories of moonlit nights, when the spirits of the old gods to whom the  temples were reared surely held converse with the spirits of the desert,  with Mirage and her pale and evading sisters of the great spaces, under  the brilliant stars. I was afraid, because I could not believe the  asservations of certain practical persons, full of the hard and almost  angry desire of \"Progress,\" that no harm had been done by the creation  of the reservoir, but that, on the contrary, it had benefited the  temple. The action of the water upon the stone, they said with vehement  voices, instead of loosening it and causing it to crumble untimely away,  had tended to harden and consolidate it. Here I should like to lie, but  I resist the temptation. Monsieur Naville has stated that possibly the  English engineers have helped to prolong the lives of the buildings of  Philae, and Monsieur Maspero has declared that \"the state of the temple  of Philae becomes continually more satisfactory.\" So be it! Longevity  has been, by a happy chance, secured. But what of beauty? What of the  beauty of the past, and what of the schemes for the future? Is  Philae even to be left as it is, or are the waters of the Nile to be  artificially raised still higher, until Philae ceases to be? Soon, no  doubt, an answer will be given.    Meanwhile, instead of the little island that I knew, and thought a  little paradise breathing out enchantment in the midst of titanic  sterility, I found a something diseased. Philae now, when out of the  water, as it was all the time when I was last in Egypt, looks like a  thing stricken with some creeping malady--one of those maladies which  begin in the lower members of a body, and work their way gradually but  inexorably upward to the trunk, until they attain the heart.    I came to it by the desert, and descended to Shellal--Shellal with  its railway-station, its workmen's buildings, its tents, its dozens of  screens to protect the hewers of stone from the burning rays of the sun,  its bustle of people, of overseers, engineers, and workmen, Egyptian,  Nubian, Italian, and Greek. The silence I had known was gone, though the  desert lay all around--the great sands, the great masses of granite  that look as if patiently waiting to be fashioned into obelisks, and  sarcophagi, and statues. But away there across the bend of the river,  dominating the ugly rummage of this intrusive beehive of human bees,  sheer grace overcoming strength both of nature and human nature,  rose the fabled \"Pharaoh's Bed\"; gracious, tender, from Shellal  most delicately perfect, and glowing with pale gold against the grim  background of the hills on the western shore. It seemed to plead for  mercy, like something feminine threatened with outrage, to protest  through its mere beauty, as a woman might protest by an attitude,  against further desecration.    And in the distance the Nile roared through the many gates of the dam,  making answer to the protest.    What irony was in this scene! In the old days of Egypt Philae was sacred  ground, was the Nile-protected home of sacerdotal mysteries, was a  veritable Mecca to the believers in Osiris, to which it was forbidden  even to draw near without permission. The ancient Egyptians swore  solemnly \"By him who sleeps in Philae.\" Now they sometimes swear angrily  at him who wakes in, or at least by, Philae, and keeps them steadily  going at their appointed tasks. And instead of it being forbidden to  draw near to a sacred spot, needy men from foreign countries flock  thither in eager crowds, not to worship in beauty, but to earn a living  wage.    And \"Pharaoh's Bed\" looks out over the water and seems to wonder what  will be the end.    I was glad to escape from Shellal, pursued by the shriek of an engine  announcing its departure from the station, glad to be on the quiet  water, to put it between me and that crowd of busy workers. Before me I  saw a vast lake, not unlovely, where once the Nile flowed swiftly, far  off a grey smudge--the very damnable dam. All around me was a grim  and cruel world of rocks, and of hills that look almost like heaps of  rubbish, some of them grey, some of them in color so dark that they  resemble the lava torrents petrified near Catania, or the \"Black  Country\" in England through which one rushes on one's way to the north.  Just here and there, sweetly almost as the pink blossoms of the wild  oleander, which I have seen from Sicilian seas lifting their heads from  the crevices of sea rocks, the amber and rosy sands of Nubia smiled down  over grit, stone, and granite.    The setting of Philae is severe. Even in bright sunshine it has an iron  look. On a grey or stormy day it would be forbidding or even terrible.  In the old winters and springs one loved Philae the more because of  the contrast of its setting with its own lyrical beauty, its curious  tenderness of charm--a charm in which the isle itself was mingled with  its buildings. But now, and before my boat had touched the quay, I saw  that the island must be ignored--if possible.    The water with which it is entirely covered during a great part of the  year seems to have cast a blight upon it. The very few palms have a  drooping and tragic air. The ground has a gangrened appearance, and much  of it shows a crawling mass of unwholesome-looking plants, which seem  crouching down as if ashamed of their brutal exposure by the receded  river, and of harsh and yellow-green grass, unattractive to the eyes. As  I stepped on shore I felt as if I were stepping on disease. But at least  there were the buildings undisturbed by any outrage. Again I turned  toward \"Pharaoh's Bed,\" toward the temple standing apart from it, which  already I had seen from the desert, near Shellal, gleaming with its  gracious sand-yellow, lifting its series of straight lines of masonry  above the river and the rocks, looking, from a distance, very simple,  with a simplicity like that of clear water, but as enticing as the light  on the first real day of spring.    I went first to \"Pharaoh's Bed.\"    Imagine a woman with a perfectly lovely face, with features as  exquisitely proportioned as those, say, of Praxiteles's statue of the  Cnidian Aphrodite, for which King Nicomedes was willing to remit the  entire national debt of Cnidus, and with a warmly white rose-leaf  complexion--one of those complexions one sometimes sees in Italian  women, colorless, yet suggestive almost of glow, of purity, with the  flame of passion behind it. Imagine that woman attacked by a malady  which leaves her features exactly as they were, but which changes the  color of her face--from the throat upward to just beneath the nose--from  the warm white to a mottled, greyish hue. Imagine the line that would  seem to be traced between the two complexions--the mottled grey  below the warm white still glowing above. Imagine this, and you have  \"Pharaoh's Bed\" and the temple of Philae as they are to-day.          XVII    \"PHARAOH'S BED\"    \"Pharaoh's Bed,\" which stands alone close to the Nile on the eastern  side of the island, is not one of those rugged, majestic buildings, full  of grandeur and splendor, which can bear, can \"carry off,\" as it were,  a cruelly imposed ugliness without being affected as a whole. It is, on  the contrary, a small, almost an airy, and a femininely perfect thing,  in which a singular loveliness of form was combined with a singular  loveliness of color. The spell it threw over you was not so much a spell  woven of details as a spell woven of divine uniformity. To put it in  very practical language, \"Pharaoh's Bed\" was \"all of a piece.\" The form  was married to the color. The color seemed to melt into the form. It was  indeed a bed in which the soul that worships beauty could rest happily  entranced. Nothing jarred. Antiquaries say that apparently this building  was left"]]]
