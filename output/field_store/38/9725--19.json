A generation passed before  Emerson was again welcomed by his alma mater.    The reader who has mastered those three utterances by the Concord  Transcendentalist in 1836, 1837, and 1838 has the key to Emerson. He was  a seer, not a system-maker. The constitution of his mind forbade formal,  consecutive, logical thought. He was not a philosopher in the accepted  sense, though he was always philosophizing, nor a metaphysician in spite  of his curious searchings in the realm of metaphysics. He sauntered in  books as he sauntered by Walden Pond, in quest of what interested him;  he \"fished in Montaigne,\" he said, as he fished in Plato and Goethe. He  basketed the day's luck, good or bad as it might be, into the pages of  his private \"Journal,\" which he called his savings-bank, because from  this source he drew most of the material for his books. The \"Journal\"  has recently been printed, in ten volumes. No American writing rewards  the reader more richly. It must be remembered that Emerson's \"Essays,\"  the first volume of which appeared in 1841, and the last volumes after  his death in 1882, represent practically three stages of composition:  first the detached thoughts of the \"Journal;\" second, the rearrangement  of this material for use upon the lecture platform; and finally, the  essays in their present form. The oral method thus predominates: a  series of oracular thoughts has been shaped for oratorical utterance,  not oratorical in the bombastic, popular American sense, but cunningly  designed, by a master of rhetoric, to capture the ear and then the mind  of the auditor.    Emerson's work as a lecturer coincided with the rise of that Lyceum  system which brought most of the American authors, for more than a  generation, into intimate contact with the public, and which proved an  important factor in the aesthetic and moral cultivation of our people.  No lecturer could have had a more auspicious influence than Emerson,  with his quiet dignity, his serene spiritual presence, his tonic and  often electrifying force. But if he gave his audiences precious gifts,  he also learned much from them. For thirty years his lecturing trips to  the West brought him, more widely than any New England man of letters,  into contact with the new, virile America of the great Mississippi  valley. Unlike many of his friends, he was not repelled by the  \"Jacksonism of the West\"; he rated it a wholesome, vivifying force  in our national thought and life. The \"Journal\" reveals the essential  soundness of his Americanism. Though surrounded all his life by  reformers, he was himself scarcely a reformer, save upon the single  issue of anti-slavery. Perhaps he was at bottom too much of a radical to  be swept off his feet by any reform.    To our generation, of course, Emerson presents himself as an author  of books, and primarily as an essayist, rather than as a winning,  entrancing speaker. His essays have a greater variety of tone than is  commonly recognized. Many of them, like \"Manners,\" \"Farming,\" \"Books,\"  \"Eloquence,\" \"Old Age,\" exhibit a shrewd prudential wisdom, a sort  of Yankee instinct for \"the milk in the pan,\" that reminds one of Ben  Franklin. Like most of the greater New England writers, he could be,  on occasion, an admirable local historian. See his essays on \"Life and  Letters in New England,\" \"New England Reformers,\" \"Politics,\" and the  successive entries in his \"Journal\" relating to Daniel Webster. He had  the happiest gift of portraiture, as is witnessed by his sketches of  Montaigne, of Napoleon, of Socrates (in the essay on Plato), of his aunt  Mary Moody Emerson, of Thoreau, and of various types of Englishmen in  his \"English Traits.\" But the great essays, no doubt, are those like  \"Self-Reliance,\" \"Compensation,\" \"The Over-Soul,\" \"Fate,\" \"Power,\"  \"Culture,\" \"Worship,\" and \"Illusions.\" These will puzzle no one who has  read carefully that first book on \"Nature.\" They all preach the gospel  of intuition, instinctive trust in the Universe, faith in the ecstatic  moment of vision into the things that are unseen by the physical  eye. Self-reliance, as Emerson's son has pointed out, means  really God-reliance; the Over-Soul--always a stumbling-block to  Philistines--means that high spiritual life into which all men may enter  and in which they share the life of Deity. Emerson is stern enough in  expounding the laws of compensation that run through the universe, but  to him the chief law is the law of the ever-ascending, victorious soul.    This radiant optimism permeates his poems. By temperament a singer as  well as a seer and sayer, Emerson was nevertheless deficient in the  singing voice. He composed no one great poem, his verse presents no  ideas that are not found in his prose. In metre and rhyme he is harsh  and willful. Yet he has marvelous single phrases and cadences. He  ejaculates transports and ecstasies, and though he cannot organize and  construct in verse, he is capable here and there of the true miracle of  transforming fact and thought into true beauty. Aldrich used to say that  he would rather have written Emerson's \"Bacchus\" than any American poem.    That the pure, high, and tonic mind of Emerson was universal in its  survey of human forces, no one would claim. Certain limitations in  interest and sympathy are obvious. \"That horrid burden and impediment  of the soul which the churches call sin,\" to use John Morley's words,  occupied his attention but little. Like a mountain climber in a perilous  pass, he preferred to look up rather than down. He does not  stress particularly those old human words, service and sacrifice.  \"Anti-scientific, antisocial, anti-Christian\" are the terms applied to  him by one of his most penetrating critics. Yet I should prefer to say  \"un-scientific,\" \"unsocial,\" and \"non-Christian,\" in the sense in which  Plato and Isaiah are non-Christian. Perhaps it would be still nearer  the truth to say, as Mrs. Lincoln said of her husband, \"He was not a  technical Christian.\" He tends to underestimate institutions of every  kind; history, except as a storehouse of anecdote, and culture as  a steady mental discipline. This is the price he pays for his  transcendental insistence upon the supreme value of the Now, the moment  of insight. But after all these limitations are properly set down, the  personality of Ralph Waldo Emerson remains a priceless possession to his  countrymen. The austere serenity of his life, and the perfection with  which he represents the highest type of his province and his era, will  ultimately become blended with the thought of his true Americanism.  A democrat and liberator, like Lincoln, he seems also destined like  Lincoln to become increasingly a world's figure, a friend and guide  to aspiring spirits everywhere. Differences of race and creed are  negligible in the presence of such superb confidence in God and the  soul.    Citizens of Concord in May, 1862, hearing that Henry Thoreau, the  eccentric bachelor, had just died of consumption in his mother's house  on Main Street, in his forty-fifth year, would have smiled cannily at  the notion that after fifty years their townsman's literary works would  be published in a sumptuous twenty-volume edition, and that critics in  his own country and in Europe would rank him with Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Yet that is precisely what has happened. Our literature has no more  curious story than the evolution of this local crank into his rightful  place of mastership. In his lifetime he printed only two books, \"A Week  on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers\"--which was even more completely  neglected by the public than Emerson's \"Nature\"--and \"Walden,\" now one  of the classics, but only beginning to be talked about when its shy,  proud author penned his last line and died with the words \"moose\" and  \"Indian\" on his lips.    Thoreau, like all thinkers who reach below the surface of human life,  means many different things to men of various temperaments. Collectors  of human novelties, like Stevenson, rejoice in his uniqueness of flavor;  critics, like Lowell, place him, not without impatient rigor. To some  readers he is primarily a naturalist, an observer, of the White of  Selborne school; to others an elemental man, a lover of the wild, a  hermit of the woods. He has been called the poet-naturalist, to indicate  that his powers of observation were accompanied, like Wordsworth's, by a  gift of emotional interpretation of the meaning of phenomena. Lovers of  literature celebrate his sheer force and penetration of phrase. But  to the student of American thought Thoreau's prime value lies in the  courage and consistency with which he endeavored to realize the gospel  of Transcendentalism in his own inner life.    Lovers of racial traits like to remember that Thoreau's grandfather  was an immigrant Frenchman from the island of Jersey, and that his  grandmother was Scotch and Quaker. His father made lead pencils and  ground plumbago in his own house in Concord. The mother was from New  Hampshire. It was a high-minded family. All the four children taught  school and were good talkers. Henry, born in 1817, was duly baptized  by good Dr. Ripley of the Old Manse, studied Greek and Latin, and was  graduated at Harvard in 1837, the year of Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa  address. Even in college the young man was a trifle difficult. \"Cold and  unimpressible,\" wrote a classmate. \"The touch of his hand was moist and  indifferent. He did not care for people.\" \"An unfavorable opinion has  been entertained of his disposition to exert himself,\" wrote President  Quincy confidentially to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#16)"],[1,"much as to make the fur appear  thin and thus injure its value. Now put a nail in the root of the  tail and fasten it to the wedge; also, draw up all slack parts and  fasten. Care should be taken to have both sides of the skin of equal  length, which can be done by lapping the leg flippers over each  other. Now draw up the under lip and fasten, and pull the nose down  until it meets the lip and tack it fast, and then the skin is ready  to hang away to cure.    Do not dry skins at a fire or in the sun, or in smoke. It often burns  them when they will not dress and are of no value. Dry in a  well-covered shed or tent where there is a free circulation of air,  and never use any preparation, such as alum and salt, as it only  injures them for market. Never stretch the noses out long, as some  trappers are inclined to do, but treat them as above described, and  they will command better values. Fur buyers are inclined to class  long-nosed skins as \"southern\" and pay a small price for them, as  Southern skins are much lighter in fur than those of the North.    The badger, beaver, bear, raccoon and wolf must always be skinned  \"open;\" that is, ripped up the belly from vent to chin after the  following manner: Cut across the hind legs as if to be \"cased\" and  then rip up the belly. The skin can then be removed by flaying as in  skinning a beef.      * * *    Another experienced trapper says: The animals which should be skinned  open are bear, beaver, raccoon, badger, timber wolf and wolverines.  The way to do this is to rip the skin open from the point of the  lower jaw, in a straight line, to the vent. Then rip it open on the  back of the hind legs, and the inside of the front legs, and peel the  skin carefully off the body. Beaver, however, should not have the  front legs split open and the tail, having no fur, is of course cut  off. If the skin is a fine one, and especially in the case of bear,  the feet should not be cut off, but should be skinned, leaving the  claws on. I would also advise saving the skull, and the proper way to  clean it is to scrape the flesh off with a knife. When the animal is  skinned, roll the skin up with the fur side out and put it in your  pack.    See that there are no burrs or lumps of mud in the fur, before you do  any fleshing. My way of fleshing furs--there may be better ways--is  to draw the skin over a smooth board, made for the purpose and  scraping, or peeling, with a blunt edged knife. Commence at the tail,  and scrape towards the head, otherwise you may injure the fibre of  the hide. Over the back and shoulders of most animals is a thin layer  of flesh. This should be removed, and when done, there should be  nothing remaining but the skin and fur. Raccoon and muskrat are  easily fleshed by pinching the flesh between the edge of the knife  and the thumb.    For stretching boards, I prefer a three board stretcher, but a plain  board will answer. For muskrats, use a single board. Open skins are  best stretched in frames or hoops, but it is all right to stretch  them on the wall on the inside of a building. The boards shown in the  cut are, to my notion, the proper shapes, and I would advise making a  good supply of them before the season commences.      [Illustration: SOME STRETCHING PATTERNS.]    To use these three board stretchers, insert the two halves of the  board in the skin, draw the skin down and fasten the hind legs, with  tacks, to the edges of the boards. This stretches the hide long. Then  insert the wedge between the two boards, which will stretch the skin  out to its fullest extent, and give it the proper shape. Finish by  fastening with tacks, pulling the nose over the point of the board,  and drawing the skin of the lower jaw up against the nose. Hang the  furs in a cool, dry place and as soon as they are dry, remove them  from the boards. Fox skins should be turned with the fur side out,  after removing from the board.    In using the hoop stretcher, the hide is laced inside the hoop, with  twine, the skin of the coon being stretched square and the beaver  round. All other furs should be stretched so as not to draw them out  of their natural shape. If the weather is warm and the furs are  likely to taint, salt them. A salted skin is better than a tainted  one. Put salt in the tail, and punch a hole in the end of the tail,  with a pointed wire, to let the water drain out, or split the tail up  about one-half inch from tip.    The skin of the bear is, perhaps, more likely to spoil than any  other, and the ears especially, are likely to taint and slip the fur.  To prevent this, slit the ears open on the inside, skin then back  almost to the edge and fill them with salt, also salt the base of the  ears, on the flesh side of the hide.      * * *      [Illustration: DAKOTA TRAPPERS' METHOD.]    In stretching, says a North Dakota trapper, we use a one board  stretcher as follows: Put on the fur after you have fleshed it, the  four feet on one side and the tail on the other. Tack down the hind  feet and the tail, then take a piece of board about 1 x 1/4 inches  (this would be about the correct size for a mink) rounded off except  on one side. Put it below the fur on the side where the feet are, tie  the front feet. When you are going to take off the fur, pull out the  small board and the fur will come off easy.      [Illustration: HOLDER FOR SKINNING.]    A contrivance which I have found useful in skinning is made of a  piece of stiff wire 18 inches long. Bend this at the middle until it  has the shape of V with the ends about 8 inches apart. Bend up an  inch at each end to form a hook and when skinning, after cutting  around the hind feet, hook into the large tendons, hang on a nail or  over limb, etc., and go ahead with both hands. The wire must be  nearly as large as a slate pencil and will work all right from foxes  down to mink. Trappers will find this a great help in skinning  animals after they have become cold. Young trappers should use this  simple device as they will be less liable to cut holes in the skin.  It pays to be careful in skinning animals properly as well as to  stretch them correctly, for both add to their market value.    How many trappers save the skulls of their larger game? All the  skulls of bear, puma or mountain lion, wolves, foxes and sometimes  those of lynx and wild cat are of ready sale if they contain good  sets of teeth. Several parties buy these skulls for cash.    To prepare them the bulk of the flesh should be removed and the brain  and eyes also. Probably the easiest way to accomplish this is to boil  the skull with flesh on in an old pot until the meat begins to get  tender. Then, while hot, it may easily be cut away, and by enlarging  the hole at the back of the skull the brain may be scooped out. They  should be watched carefully as if boiled too long the teeth drop out,  bones separate and render the skull worthless. It is safe, but more  tedious to clean them with a sharp knife without boiling.    The dealers pay from 50 cents for a bear skull to 15 cents for a fox,  tho taxidermists and furriers often pay much more. The British  Columbia Government pays bounties upon the skulls, only I think this  is a good idea as the skins are not mutilated and depreciated by  scalping, punching or cutting as usual. Save a few good skulls and  add dollars to the value of your catch.      * * *    Take two pieces of No. 9 fence wire about 30 inches long, writes an  Ohio coon hunter and trapper, file one end sharp, then commence at  each hind foot and punch the wire thru close to the edge as in  sewing, taking stitches an inch or so long until you get to the front  foot, then pull the hide along the wire just far enough so the top  and bottom will stretch out to make it square, or a few inches longer  than the width is better.      [Illustration: WIRE COON METHOD.]    Put 3 or 4 nails in each side, then commence at the top and tack all  but the head, then pull the bottom down even with the sides, not  tacking the head, which lets it draw down into the hide, then tack  the head. This is an easy and good way to handle coon skins making  them nearly square when stretched.    Many inexperienced trappers stretch coon skins too long and draw out  the head and neck. This can be avoided by following instructions  given here. Coon can be cased but most dealers prefer to have them  stretched open.      * * *    Get a lot of steel wire, says a Missouri trapper who uses old  umbrella wires, the round solid ones. Sharpen one end, take your coon  skin and run one wire up each side and one across each end.    In putting these wires in do it like the old woman knits, that is,  wrap the hide around the wire and stick it thru about every inch. Now  cut six small twigs, make them the proper length and notch the ends,  and you will soon have your hide stretched expert trapper style.      [Illustration: WIRE AND TWIG COON METHOD.]    The advantage of this is you can carry stretchers enough for  twenty-five skins in one hand and don't have to hunt up a barn door  and box of tacks and hammer every time you want to stretch one. You  can stretch in one-fourth the time it would take to tack up on a  board, and you will have it in first class style the first time and  not have to pull out a tack here and stretch a little more there.      * * *    I have always used the whole board (not split into two pieces and  wedged shape piece as some do), writes a Massachusetts trapper, and  made as follows:    For mink I use a 3/8 inch board about 40 inches in length, 4 inches  wide at the large end, tapering to about 2 1/2 inches at the small  end with the edges planed down from near the middle of the board to  the edge, leaving a thin edge and sandpapered down smooth. I make the  board of this length for the reason that it sometimes happens that a  mink may have laid in a trap for several days before being taken out,  and if under water it is not always easy to determine the"]]]
