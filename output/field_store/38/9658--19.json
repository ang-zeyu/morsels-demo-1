All except the  extreme radicals were willing to support the President or to come to  some fairly reasonable compromise. But at no time were they given an  opportunity to get together. Johnson and the administration leaders did  little in this direction and the radicals made the most skillful use of  the divisions among the conservatives.    Whatever final judgment may be passed upon the radical reconstruction  policy and its results, there can be no doubt of the political dexterity  of those who carried it through. Chief among them was Thaddeus Stevens,  vindictive and unscrupulous, filled with hatred of the Southern leaders,  bitter in speech and possessing to an extreme degree the faculty of  making ridiculous those who opposed him. He advocated confiscation, the  proscription or exile of leading whites, the granting of the franchise  and of lands to the Negroes, and in Southern states the establishment  of territorial governments under the control of Congress. These states  should, he said, \"never be recognized as capable of acting in the  Union... until the Constitution shall have been so amended as to make  it what the makers intended, and so as to secure perpetual ascendancy to  the party of the Union.\"    Charles Sumner, the leader of the radicals in the Senate, was moved less  than Stevens by personal hostility toward the whites of the South, but  his sympathy was reserved entirely for the blacks. He was unpractical,  theoretical, and not troubled by constitutional scruples. To him the  Declaration of Independence was the supreme law, and it was the duty of  Congress to express its principles in appropriate legislation. Unlike  Stevens, who had a genuine liking for the Negro, Sumner's sympathy  for the race was purely intellectual; for the individual Negro he felt  repulsion. His views were in effect not different from those of Stevens.  And he was practical enough not to overlook the value of the Negro vote.  \"To my mind,\" he said, \"nothing is clearer than the absolute necessity  of suffrage for all colored persons in the disorganized states. It will  not be enough if you give it to those who read and write; you will  not, in this way, acquire the voting force which you need there for the  protection of unionists, whether white or black. You will not secure  the new allies who are essential to the national cause.\" A leader of the  second rank was his colleague Henry Wilson, who was also actuated by  a desire for the Negro's welfare and for the perpetuation of the  Republican party, which he said contained in its ranks \"more of  moral and intellectual worth than was ever embodied in any political  organization in any land... created by no man or set of men but brought  into being by Almighty God himself... and endowed by the Creator with  all political power and every office under Heaven.\" Shellabarger of Ohio  was another important figure among the radicals. The following extract  from one of his speeches gives an indication of his character and  temperament: \"They [the Confederates] framed iniquity and universal  murder into law.... Their pirates burned your unarmed commerce upon  every sea. They carved the bones of the dead heroes into ornaments,  and drank from goblets made out of their skulls. They poisoned your  fountains, put mines under your soldiers' prisons; organized bands whose  leaders were concealed in your homes; and commissions ordered the torch  and yellow fever to be carried to your cities and to your women and  children. They planned one universal bonfire of the North from Lake  Ontario to the Missouri.\"    Among the lesser lights may be mentioned Morton and Wade, both bluff,  coarse, and ungenerous, and thoroughly convinced that the Republican  party had a monopoly of loyalty, wisdom, and virtues, and that by any  means it must gain and keep control; Boutwell, fanatical and mediocre;  and Benjamin Butler, a charlatan and demagogue. As a class the Western  radicals were less troubled by humanitarian ideals than were those of  the East and sought more practical political results.    The Joint Committee on Reconstruction which finally decided the fate  of the Southern states was composed of eight radicals, four moderate  Republicans, and three Democrats. As James Gillespie Blaine wrote  later, \"it was foreseen that in an especial degree the fortunes of the  Republican party would be in the keeping of the fifteen men who might  be chosen.\" This committee was divided into four subcommittees to take  testimony. The witnesses, all of whom were examined at Washington,  included army officers and Bureau agents who had served in the South,  Southern Unionists, a few politicians, and several former Confederates,  among them General Robert E. Lee and Alexander H. Stephens. Most of  the testimony was of the kind needed to support the contentions of the  radicals that Negroes were badly treated in the South; that the whites  were disloyal; that, should they be left in control, the Negro, free  labor, the nation, and the Republican party would be in danger; that  the army and the Freedmen's Bureau must be kept in the South; and that  a radical reconstruction was necessary. No serious effort, however, was  made to ascertain the actual conditions in the South. Slow to formulate  a definite plan, the Joint Committee guided public sentiment toward  radicalism, converted gradually the Republican Congressmen, and little  by little undermined the power and influence of the President.    Not until after the new year was it plain that there was to be a fight  to the finish between Congress and the President. Congress had refused  in December 1865, to accept the President's program, but there was still  hope for a compromise. Many conservatives had voted for the delay merely  to assert the rights of Congress; but the radicals wanted time to frame  a program. The Northern Democrats were embarrassingly cordial in their  support of Johnson and so also were most Southerners. The moderates were  not far away from the position of the President and the administration  Republicans. But the radicals skillfully postponed a test of strength  until Stevens and Sumner were ready. The latter declared that a  generation must elapse \"before the rebel communities have so far been  changed as to become safe associates in a common government. Time,  therefore, we must have. Through time all other guarantees may be  obtained; but time itself is a guarantee.\"    To the Joint Committee were referred without debate all measures  relating to reconstruction, but the Committee was purposely making  little progress--contented merely to take testimony and to act as a  clearing house for the radical \"facts\" about \"Southern outrages\" while  waiting for the tide to turn. The \"Black Laws\" and the election of  popular Confederate leaders to office in the South were effectively used  to alarm the friends of the Negroes, and the reports from the  Bureau agents gave support to those who condemned the Southern state  governments as totally inadequate and disloyal.    So apparent was the growth of radicalism that the President, alarmed by  the attitude of Sumner and Stevens and their followers, began to fear  for the Constitution and forced the fight. The passage of a bill on  February 6, 1866, extending the life of the Freedmen's Bureau furnished  the occasion for the beginning of the open struggle. On the 19th of  February, Johnson vetoed the bill, and the next day an effort was made  to pass it over the veto. Not succeeding in this attempt, the House  of Representatives adopted a concurrent resolution that Senators and  Representatives from the Southern states should be excluded until  Congress declared them entitled to representation. Ten days later the  Senate also adopted the resolution.    Though it was not yet too late for Johnson to meet the conservatives  of Congress on middle ground, he threw away his opportunity by an  intemperate and undignified speech on the 22d of February to a crowd at  the White House. As usual when excited, he forgot the proprieties and  denounced the radicals as enemies of the Union and even went so far  as to charge Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips with endeavoring  to destroy the fundamental principles of the government. Such conduct  weakened his supporters and rejoiced his enemies. It was expected that  Johnson would approve the bill to confer civil rights upon the Negroes,  but, goaded perhaps by the speeches of Stevens, he vetoed it on the 27th  of March. Its patience now exhausted, Congress passed the bill over  the President's veto. To secure the requisite majority in the Senate,  Stockton, Democratic Senator from New Jersey, was unseated on technical  grounds, and Senator Morgan, who was \"paired\" with a sick colleague,  broke his word to vote aye--for which Wade offensively thanked God. The  moderates had now fallen away from the President, and at least for this  session of Congress, his policies were wrecked. On the 16th of July, the  supplementary Freedmen's Bureau Act was passed over the veto, and on  the 24th of July Tennessee was readmitted to representation by a law  the preamble of which asserted unmistakably that Congress had assumed  control of reconstruction.    Meanwhile the Joint Committee on Reconstruction had made a report  asserting that the Southerners had forfeited all constitutional rights,  that their state governments were not in constitutional form, and that  restoration could be accomplished only when Congress and the President  acted together in fixing the terms of readmission. The uncompromising  hostility of the South, the Committee asserted, made necessary adequate  safeguards which should include the disfranchisement of the white  leaders, either Negro suffrage or a reduction of white representation,  and repudiation of the Confederate war debt with recognition of the  validity of the United States debt.

Moreover they stayed long  enough in friendship with the newcomers to teach them many things of  value. Then they departed, leaving with the English a clear title to as  much land as they could handle, at least for some time to come. Later,  with other Indians, as with these, the Calverts pursued a conciliatory  policy. They were aided by the fact that the Susquehannocks to the  north, who might have given trouble, were involved in war with yet more  northerly tribes, and could pay scant attention to the incoming white  men. But even so, the Calverts proved, as William Penn proved later,  that men may live at peace with men, honestly and honorably, even though  hue of skin and plane of development differ.    Now the Ark joins the Dove in the River St. George. The pieces of  ordnance are fired; the colonists disembark; and on the 27th of March,  1634, the Indian village, now English, becomes St. Mary's.    On the whole how advantageously are they placed! There is peace with  the Indians. Huts, lodges, are already built, fields already cleared  or planted. The site is high and healthful. They have at first few  dissensions among themselves. Nor are they entirely alone or isolated  in the New World. There is a New England to the north of them and a  Virginia to the south. From the one they get in the autumn salted fish,  from the other store of swine and cattle. Famine and pestilence are far  from them. They build a \"fort\" and perhaps a stockade, but there are  none of the stealthy deaths given by arrow and tomahawk in the north,  nor are there any of the Spanish alarms that terrified the south. From  the first they have with them women and children. They know that their  settlement is \"home.\" Soon other ships and colonists follow the Ark and  the Dove to St. Mary's, and the history of this middle colony is well  begun.    In Virginia, meantime, there was jealousy enough of the new colony,  taking as it did territory held to be Virginian and renaming it, not  for the old, independent, Protestant, virgin queen, but for a French,  Catholic, queen consort--even settling it with believers in the Mass  and bringing in Jesuits! It was, says a Jamestown settler, \"accounted a  crime almost as heinous as treason to favour, nay to speak well of that  colony.\" Beside the Virginian folk as a whole, one man, in particular,  William Claiborne, nursed an individual grievance. He had it from  Governor Calvert that he might dwell on in Kent Island, trading from  there, but only under license from the Lord Proprietor and as an  inhabitant of Maryland, not of Virginia. Claiborne, with the Assembly  at Jamestown secretly on his side, resisted this interference with his  rights, and, as he continued to trade with a high hand, he soon fell  under suspicion of stirring up the Indians against the Marylanders.    At the time, this quarrel rang loud through Maryland and Virginia, and  even echoed across the Atlantic. Leonard Calvert had a trading-boat of  Claiborne's seized in the Patuxent River. Thereupon Claiborne's men,  with the shallop Cockatrice, in retaliation attacked Maryland pinnaces  and lost both their lives and their boat. For several years Maryland and  Kent Island continued intermittently to make petty war on each other.  At last, in 1638, Calvert took the island by main force and hanged  for piracy a captain of Claiborne's. The Maryland Assembly brought the  trader under a Bill of Attainder; and a little later, in England, the  Lords Commissioners of Foreign Plantations formally awarded Kent Island  to the Lord Proprietor. Thus defeated, Claiborne, nursing his wrath,  moved down the bay to Virginia.        CHAPTER X. CHURCH AND KINGDOM    Virginia, all this time, with Maryland a thorn in her side, was  wrestling with an autocratic governor, John Harvey. This avaricious  tyrant sowed the wind until in 1635 he was like to reap the whirlwind.  Though he was the King's Governor and in good odor in England, where  rested the overpower to which Virginia must bow, yet in this year  Virginia blew upon her courage until it was glowing and laid rude hands  upon him. We read: \"An Assembly to be called to receive complaints  against Sr. John Harvey, on the petition of many inhabitants, to meet  7th of May.\" But, before that month was come, the Council, seizing  opportunity, acted for the whole. Immediately below the entry above  quoted appears: \"On the 28th of April, 1635, Sr. John Harvey thrust out  of his government, and Capt. John West acts as Governor till the King's  pleasure known.\"*         * Hening's \"Statutes\" vol. I p. 223.    So Virginia began her course as rebel against political evils! It is  of interest to note that Nicholas Martian, one of the men found active  against the Governor, was an ancestor of George Washington.    Harvey, thrust out, took first ship for England, and there also sailed  commissioners from the Virginia Assembly with a declaration of wrongs  for the King's ear. But when they came to England, they found that the  King's ear was for the Governor whom he had given to the Virginians and  whom they, with audacious disobedience, had deposed. Back should go  Sir John Harvey, still governing Virginia; back without audience the  so-called commissioners, happy to escape a merited hanging! Again to  Jamestown sailed Harvey. In silence Virginia received him, and while he  remained Governor no Assembly sat.    But having asserted his authority, the King in a few years' time was  willing to recall his unwelcome representative. So in 1639 Governor  Harvey vanishes from the scene, and in comes the well-liked Sir Francis  Wyatt as Governor for the second time. For two years he remains, and is  then superseded by Sir William Berkeley, a notable figure in Virginia  for many years to come. The population was now perhaps ten thousand,  both English born and Virginians born of English parents. A few hundred  negroes moved in the tobacco fields. More would be brought in and yet  more. And now above a million pounds of tobacco were going annually to  England.    The century was predominantly one of inner and outer religious conflict.  What went on at home in England reechoed in Virginia. The new Governor  was a dyed-in-the-wool Cavalier, utterly stubborn for King and Church.  The Assemblies likewise leaned that way, as presumably did the mass  of the people. It was ordered in 1631: \"That there bee a uniformitie  throughout this colony both in substance and circumstance to the cannons  and constitutions of the church of England as neere as may bee, and  that every person yeald readie obedience unto them uppon penaltie of the  paynes and forfeitures in that case appoynted.\" And, indeed, the pains  and forfeitures threatened were savage enough.    Official Virginia, loyal to the Established Church, was jealous and  fearful of Papistry and looked askance at Puritanism. It frowned upon  these and upon agnosticisms, atheisms, pantheisms, religious doubts, and  alterations in judgment--upon anything, in short, that seemed to push a  finger against Church and Kingdom. Yet in this Virginia, governed by  Sir William Berkeley, a gentleman more cavalier than the Cavaliers, more  royalist than the King, more churchly than the Church, there lived not  a few Puritans and Dissidents, going on as best they might with  Established Church and fiery King's men. Certain parishes were  predominantly Puritan; certain ministers were known to have leanings  away from surplices and genuflections and to hold that Archbishop Laud  was some kin to the Pope. In 1642, to reenforce these ministers, came  three more from New England, actively averse to conformity. But Governor  and Council and the majority of the Burgesses will have none of that.  The Assembly of 1643 takes sharp action.    For the preservation of the puritie of doctrine and unitie of the  church, IT IS ENACTED that all ministers whatsoever which shall reside  in the collony are to be conformable to the orders and constitutions  of the church of England, and the laws therein established, and not  otherwise to be admitted to teach or preach publickly or privately.  And that the Gov. and Counsel do take care that all nonconformists  upon notice of them shall be compelled to depart the collony with all  conveniencie. And so in consequence out of Virginia, to New England  where Independents were welcome, or to Maryland where any Christian  might dwell, went these tainted ministers. But there stayed behind  Puritan and nonconforming minds in the bodies of many parishioners. They  must hold their tongues, indeed, and outwardly conform--but they watched  lynx-eyed for their opportunity and a more favorable fortune.    Having launched thunderbolts against schismatics of this sort, Berkeley,  himself active and powerful, with the Council almost wholly of his  party and the House of Burgesses dominantly so, turned his attention  to \"popish recusants.\" Of these there were few or none dwelling in  Virginia. Let them then not attempt to come from Maryland! The rulers of  the colony legislated with vigor: papists may not hold any public place;  all statutes against them shall be duly executed; popish priests by  chance or intent arriving within the bounds of Virginia shall be given  five days' warning, and, if at the end of this time they are yet upon  Virginian soil, action shall be brought against them. Berkeley sweeps  with an impatient broom.    The Kingdom is cared for not less than the Church in Virginia. Any  and all persons coming into the colony by land and by sea shall have  administered to them the Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance. \"Which if any  shall refuse to take,\" the commander of the fort at Point Comfort  shall \"committ him or them to prison.\" Foreigners in birth and tongue,  foreigners in thought, must have found the place and time narrow indeed.
