I point them out to you, that, if you find  yourselves in an Error, you may not want the Means to correct it, nor  an Oracle to apply to whenever you have occasion. From whence I have  good Grounds to hope, that the true Taste in Singing will last to the  End of the World.    Sec. 32. Whoever comprehends what has been demonstrated to him, in these  and many other Observations, will need no farther Incitement to study.  Stirred up by his own Desire, he will fly to his beloved Instrument,  from which, by continued Application, he will find he has no Reason to  sit down satisfied with what he has learn'd before. He will make new  Discoveries, inventing new Graces, from whence after comparing them well  together, he will chuse the best, and will make use of them as long as  he thinks them so; but, going on in refining, he will find others more  deserving his Esteem. To conclude, from these he will proceed on to an  almost infinite Number of _Graces_, by the means whereof his Mind will  be so opened, that the most hidden Treasures of the Art, and most  remote from his Imagination, will voluntarily present themselves; so  that, unless Pride blinds him, or Study becomes tiresome to him, or his  Memory fails him, he will increase his Store of Embellishments in a  Stile which will be entirely his own: The principal Aim of one that  strives to gain the highest Applause.    Sec. 33. Finally, O ye young Singers, hearken to me for your Profit and  Advantage. The Abuses, the Defects, and the Errors divulged by me in  these Observations, (which in Justice ought not to be charg'd on the  _Modern_ Stile) were once almost all Faults I myself was guilty of; and  in the Flower of my Youth, when I thought myself to be a great Man, it  was not easy for me to discover them. But, in a more mature Age, the  slow Undeceit comes too late. I know I have sung ill, and would I have  not writ worse! but since I have suffered by my Ignorance, let it at  least serve for a Warning to amend those who wish to sing well. He that  studies, let him imitate the ingenious Bee, that sucks its Honey from  the most grateful Flowers. From those called _Ancients_, and those  supposed _Moderns_, (as I have said) much may be learn'd; it is enough to  find out the Flower, and know how to distill, and draw the Essence from  it.    Sec. 34. The most cordial, and not less profitable Advice, I can give you,  is the following:    Sec. 35. Remember what has been wisely observed, that Mediocrity of Merit  can but for a short time eclipse the true Sublime, which, how old soever  it grows, can never die.    Sec. 36. Abhor the Example of those who hate Correction; for like Lightning  to those who walk in the Dark, tho' it frightens them, it gives them  Light.    Sec. 37. Learn from the Errors of others: O great Lesson! it costs little,  and instructs much. Of every one something is to be learned, and the  most Ignorant is sometimes the greatest Master.    _FINIS_.          PLATES    Pl.

In _Italy_ there arose from that School,  among several others, _P. Alis. Palestrina_, a Genius so extraordinary,  that he is looked upon as the _Raphael_ among the Musicians. He lived in  Pope _Leo_ the Tenth's Time; and no Musick, that we know of, is  performed at the Pope's Chapel, to this Day, but of his Composition,  except the famous _Miserere_ of _Allegri_, who liv'd a little time after  _Palestrina_.    [2] Our Author seems to be a little too partial in Favour of the Singer,  all momentary Productions being the same; though it must be allowed,  that by reason of the Expression of the Words, any Error in Singing will  be more capital, than if the same were committed on an Instrument.    [3] The Author directs this for the Instruction of a _Soprano_, or a  treble Voice, because Youth possesses that Voice mostly, and that is the  Age when they should begin to study Musick. It may not be amiss to  mention, that the _Soprano_ is most apt to perform the Things required  by your Author, and that every different Scale of Voice has something  peculiarly relative to its Kind as its own Property; for a _Soprano_ has  generally most Volubility, and becomes it best; and also equally the  Pathetick. The _Contr'Alto_ more of the Pathetick than the Volubility;  the _Tenor_ less of the Pathetick, but more of the Volubility than the  _Contr'Alto_, though not so much as the _Soprano_. The _Bass_, in  general more pompous than any, but should not be so boisterous as now  too often practised.    [4] By this section, and mostly throughout the Work, one sees, the  Author calculated this Treatise chiefly for the Advantage of Professors  of Musick; but, notwithstanding, it appears in several Places, that his  Intention is, that all Lovers of Musick should also be the better for  it.    [5] _The Explanation of_ Sic vos non vobis, _&c._, _for the Satisfaction  of those who do not perfectly remember it_.    _Virgil_ having composed a Distich, containing the Praise of _Augustus_,  and a Compliment on his good Fortune, fix'd it on the Palace Gate,  without any Name subscrib'd. _Augustus_, making strict Enquiry after the  Author, and _Virgil's_ Modesty not suffering him to own the Verses, one  _Bathillus_, a Poet of a mean Reputation, owned himself the Author, and  received Honour and Reward from the Emperor. _Virgil_, somewhat  scandalized at this Accident, fixed an Hemistich in these Words (_Sic  vos non vobis_) four times repeated under the other, where he had placed  the former Verses. The Emperor was as diligent to have these Hemistichs  filled up, but no-body appearing to do it, at length _Virgil_ supplied  them thus:        _Hos ego Versiculos feci, tulit alter Honores;        Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves.        Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves.        Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes.        Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves._    i.e. These Verses I made, but another has taken the Applause of them.        _So ye Birds build not your Nests          For yourselves.      So ye Sheep bear not your Wool          For yourselves.      So ye Bees make not your Honey          For yourselves.      So ye Oxen submit to the Plow          Not for yourselves_.    Upon this Discovery, _Bathillus_ became the Ridicule of _Rome_, and  _Virgil_ acquired a double Reputation.    The Distich, which _Bathillus_ claim'd for his, was this:      _Nocte plut tota, redeunt spectacula mane,    Divisum Imperium cum Jove Caesar habet._    i.e. It rain'd all Night; in the Morning the publick Shews return:  _Jove_ and _Caesar_ divide the Rule of the World. The Compliment is, that  _Caesar_ designing to exhibit Sports to the People, though the preceding  Night was rainy and unpromising, yet such Weather returned with the  Morning, as did not disappoint the Solemnity.

Sherman pointed out to the visiting Secretary of  War, Simon Cameron, that while McClellan had a hundred thousand  men for a front of a hundred miles in Virginia, and Frémont had  sixty thousand for about the same distance, he (Sherman) had been  given only eighteen thousand to guard the link between them, although  this link stretched out three hundred miles. Sherman then asked for  sixty thousand men at once; and said two hundred thousand would  be needed later on. \"Good God!\" said Cameron, \"where are they to  come from?\" Come they had to, as Sherman foresaw. Cameron made  trouble at Washington by calling Sherman's words \"insane\"; and  Sherman's \"insanity\" became a stumbling-block that took a long time  to remove.    Grant, in command at Cairo, began his career as a general by cleverly  forestalling the enemy at Paducah, where the Tennessee flows into the  Ohio. Then, on the seventh of November, he closed the first confused  campaign on the Mississippi by attacking Belmont, Missouri, twenty  miles downstream from Cairo, in order to prevent the Confederates at  Columbus, Kentucky, right opposite, from sending reinforcements to  Sterling Price in Arkansas. There was a stiff fight, in which the  Union gunboats did good work. Grant handled his soldiers equally  well; and the Union objective was fully attained.      Halleck, the Federal Commander-in-Chief for the river campaign  of '62, fixed his headquarters at St. Louis. From this main base  his right wing had rails as far as Rolla, whence the mail road  went on southwest, straight across Missouri. At Lebanon, near the  middle of the State, General Samuel R. Curtis was concentrating,  before advancing still farther southwest against the Confederates  whom he eventually fought at Pea Ridge. From St. Louis there was  good river, rail, and road connection south to Halleck's center in  the neighborhood of Cairo, where General Ulysses S. Grant had his  chief field base, at the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio. A  little farther east Grant had another excellent position at Paducah,  beside the junction of the Ohio and the Tennessee. Naval forces  were of course indispensable for this amphibious campaign; and in  Flag-Officer Andrew Hull Foote the Western Flotilla had a commander  able to coöperate with the best of his military colleagues. Halleck's  left--a semi-independent command--was based on the Ohio, stretched  clear across Kentucky, and was commanded by a good organizer and  disciplinarian, General Don Carlos Buell, whose own position at  Munfordville was not only near the middle of the State but about  midway between the important railway junctions of Louisville and  Nashville.    Henry W. Halleck was a middle-aged, commonplace, and very cautious  general, who faithfully plodded through the war without defeat or  victory. He looked so long before he leaped that he never leaped at  all--not even on retreating enemies. Good for the regular office-work  routine, he was like a hen with ducklings for this river war, in  which Curtis, Grant, Buell, and his naval colleague Foote, were  all his betters on the fighting line.    His opponent, Albert Sidney Johnston, was also middle-aged, being  fifty-nine; but quite fit for active service. Johnston had had  a picturesque career, both in and out of the army; and many on  both sides thought him likely to prove the greatest leader of the  war. He was, however, a less formidable opponent than Northerners  were apt to think. He was not a consummate genius like Lee. He had  inferior numbers and resources; and the Confederate Government  interfered with him. Yet they did have the good sense to put both  sides of the Mississippi under his unified command, including not  only Kentucky and Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas, but the whole  of the crucial stretch from Vicksburg to Port Hudson. In this they  were wiser than the Federal Government with Halleck's command,  which was neither so extensive nor so completely unified.    Johnston took post in his own front line at Bowling Green, Kentucky,  not far south of Buell's position at Munfordville. He was very  anxious to keep a hold on Kentucky and Missouri, along the southern  frontiers of which his forces were arrayed. His extreme right was  thrown northward under General Marshall to Prestonburg, near the  border of West Virginia, in the dangerous neighborhood of many  Union mountain folk. His southern outpost on the right was also  in the same kind of danger at Cumberland Gap, a strategic pass  into the Alleghanies at a point where Kentucky, Tennessee, and  Virginia meet. Halfway west from there, to Bowling Green the  Confederates hoped to hold the Cumberland near Logan's Cross Roads  and Mill Springs. Westwards from Bowling Green Johnston's line held  positions at Fort Donelson on the Cumberland, Fort Henry on the  Tennessee, and Columbus on the Mississippi. All his Trans-Mississippi  troops were under the command of the enthusiastic Earl Van Dorn,  who hoped to end his spring campaign in triumph at St. Louis.      The fighting began in January at the northeastern end of the line,  where the Union Government, chiefly for political reasons, was  particularly anxious to strengthen the Unionists that lived all  down the western Alleghanies and so were a thorn in the side of  the solid South beyond. On the tenth Colonel James A. Garfield, a  future President, attacked and defeated Marshall near Prestonburg  and occupied the line of Middle Creek. The Confederates, half starved,  half clad, ill armed, slightly outnumbered, and with no advantage  except their position, fought well, but unavailingly. Only some  three thousand men were engaged on both sides put together. Yet  the result was important because it meant that the Confederates  had lost their hold on the eastern end of Kentucky, which was now  in unrestricted touch with West Virginia.    Within eight days a greater Union commander, General G. H. Thomas,  emerged as the victor of a much bigger battle at Mill Springs and  Logan's Cross Roads on the upper Cumberland, ninety miles due east  of Bowling Green. The victory was complete, and Thomas's name was  made. Thomas, indeed, was known already as a man whose stentorian  orders had to be obeyed; and a clever young Confederate prisoner  used this reputation as his excuse for getting beaten: \"We were doing  pretty good fighting till old man Thomas rose up in his stirrups,  and we heard him holler out: 'Attention, Creation! By kingdoms,  right wheel!' Then we knew you had us.\"    There were only about four thousand men a side. But in itself, and  in conjunction with Garfield's little victory at Prestonburg, the  battle of Logan's Cross Roads was important as raising the Federal  morale, as breaking through Johnston's right, and as opening the road  into eastern Tennessee. Short supplies and almost impassable roads,  however, prevented a further advance. One brigade was therefore  detached against Cumberland Gap, while the rest joined Buell's  command, which was engaged in organizing, drilling hard, and keeping  an eye on Johnston.    In February the scene of action changed to Johnston's left center,  where Forts Donelson and Henry were blocking the Federal advance  up the Cumberland and the Tennessee.    On the fourth, Flag-Officer Foote, with seven gunboats, of which  four were ironclads, led the way up the Tennessee, against Fort  Henry. That day the furious current was dashing driftwood in whirling  masses against the flotilla, which had all it could do to keep  station, even with double anchors down and full steam up. Next  morning a new danger appeared in the shape of what looked like a  school of dead porpoises. These were Confederate torpedoes, washed  from their moorings. As it was now broad daylight they were all  successfully avoided; and the crews felt as if they had won the  first round.    The sixth of February dawned clear, with just sufficient breeze to  blow the smoke away. The flotilla steamed up the swollen Tennessee  between the silent, densely wooded banks. Not a sound was heard  ashore until, just after noon, Fort Henry came into view and answered  the flagship's signal shot with a crashing discharge of all its  big guns. Then the fire waxed hot and heavy on both sides, the  gunboats knocking geyser-spouts of earth about the fort, and the  fort knocking gigantic splinters out of the gunboats. The _Essex_  ironclad was doing very well when a big shot crashed into her middle  boiler, which immediately burst like a shell, scalding the nearest  men to death, burning others, and sending the rest flying overboard  or aft. With both pilots dead and Commander W. D. Porter badly  scalded, the _Essex_ was drifting out of action when the word went  round that Fort Henry had surrendered: and there, sure enough,  were the Confederate colors coming down. Instantly Porter rallied  for the moment, called for three cheers, and fell back exhausted  at the third.    The Confederate General Tilghman surrendered to Foote with less  than a hundred men, all the rest, over twenty-five hundred, having  started towards Fort Donelson before the flag came down. The Western  Flotilla had won the day alone. But it was the fear of Grant's  approaching army that hurried the escaping garrison. An hour after  the surrender Grant rode in and took command. That night victors  and vanquished were dining together when a fussy staff officer came  in to tell Grant that he could not find the Confederate reports.  On this Captain Jesse Taylor, the chief Confederate staff officer,  replied that he had destroyed them. The angry Federal then turned  on him with the question, \"Don't you know you've laid yourself  open to punishment?\" and was storming along, when Grant quietly  broke in: \"I should be very much surprised and mortified if one  of my subordinate officers should allow information which he could  destroy to fall into the hands of the enemy.\"  "]]]
