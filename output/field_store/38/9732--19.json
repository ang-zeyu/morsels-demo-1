And she wanted to  hear the storm-wind in the pines.    A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the  proof that no roof stood between her and the elements. Then a breeze  bore the smell of burnt wood into her face, and somehow her quick mind  flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little  brothers. The memory faded. The roar that had seemed distant was now  back in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a  stream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,  oncoming, and heavy this storm-wind! She likened its approach to the  tread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there  behind her. Not a pine-needle quivered in the light of the camp-fire.  But the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar  augmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on-sweeping crash, like  an ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen  with fright. The deafening storm-blast was upon them. Helen felt the  saddle-pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its  very roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree-tops.  And for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.  Then the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,  lessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the  distance.    No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and  ceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard  again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way  of this storm-wind of the mountain forest.    A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's  directions, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike  over the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, she closed  her eyes, and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain  faded. Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the  tarpaulin.      When she opened her eyes she remembered everything, as if only a moment  had elapsed. But it was daylight, though gray and cloudy. The pines were  dripping mist. A fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and  a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air. Horses were standing  near by, biting and kicking at one another. Bo was sound asleep. Dale  appeared busy around the camp-fire. As Helen watched the hunter she  saw him pause in his task, turn his ear to listen, and then look  expectantly. And at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest.  Helen recognized Roy's voice. Then she heard a splashing of water, and  hoof-beats coming closer. With that the buckskin mustang trotted into  camp, carrying Roy.    \"Bad mornin' for ducks, but good for us,\" he called.    \"Howdy, Roy!\" greeted Dale, and his gladness was unmistakable. \"I was  lookin' for you.\"    Roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort, and his swift  hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled. Buckskin was wet with sweat  and foam mixed with rain. He heaved. And steam rose from him.    \"Must have rode hard,\" observed Dale.    \"I shore did,\" replied Roy. Then he espied Helen, who had sat up, with  hands to her hair, and eyes staring at him.    \"Mornin', miss. It's good news.\"    \"Thank Heaven!\" murmured Helen, and then she shook Bo. That young lady  awoke, but was loath to give up slumber. \"Bo! Bo! Wake up! Mr. Roy is  back.\"    Whereupon Bo sat up, disheveled and sleepy-eyed.    \"Oh-h, but I ache!\" she moaned. But her eyes took in the camp scene to  the effect that she added, \"Is breakfast ready?\"    \"Almost. An' flapjacks this mornin',\" replied Dale.    Bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she  laced her boots. Helen got their traveling-bag, and with this they  repaired to a flat stone beside the spring, not, however, out of earshot  of the men.    \"How long are you goin' to hang around camp before tellin' me?\" inquired  Dale.    \"Jest as I figgered, Milt,\" replied Roy. \"Thet rider who passed you was  a messenger to Anson. He an' his gang got on our trail quick. About ten  o'clock I seen them comin'. Then I lit out for the woods. I stayed off  in the woods close enough to see where they come in. An' shore they  lost your trail. Then they spread through the woods, workin' off to the  south, thinkin', of course, thet you would circle round to Pine on the  south side of Old Baldy. There ain't a hoss-tracker in Snake Anson's  gang, thet's shore. Wal, I follered them for an hour till they'd rustled  some miles off our trail. Then I went back to where you struck into  the woods. An' I waited there all afternoon till dark, expectin' mebbe  they'd back-trail. But they didn't. I rode on a ways an' camped in the  woods till jest before daylight.\"    \"So far so good,\" declared Dale.    \"Shore. There's rough country south of Baldy an' along the two or three  trails Anson an' his outfit will camp, you bet.\"    \"It ain't to be thought of,\" muttered Dale, at some idea that had struck  him.    \"What ain't?\"    \"Goin' round the north side of Baldy.\"    \"It shore ain't,\" rejoined Roy, bluntly.    \"Then I've got to hide tracks certain--rustle to my camp an' stay there  till you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to Pine.\"    \"Milt, you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets.\"    \"I ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether. If Anson had any eyes  for the woods he'd not have lost me so soon.    \"No. But, you see, he's figgerin' to cross your trail.\"    \"If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks  certain, I'd feel safe from pursuit, anyway,\" said the hunter,  reflectively.    \"Shore an' easy,\" responded Roy, quickly. \"I jest met up with some  greaser sheep-herders drivin' a big flock. They've come up from the  south an' are goin' to fatten up at Turkey Senacas. Then they'll drive  back south an' go on to Phenix. Wal, it's muddy weather. Now you break  camp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail, as if you  was travelin' south. But, instead, you ride round ahead of thet flock of  sheep. They'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks  of woods out here. An', passin' over your tracks, they'll hide 'em.\"    \"But supposin' Anson circles an' hits this camp? He'll track me easy out  to that sheep trail. What then?\"    \"Jest what you want. Goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy.  It's goin' to rain hard. Your tracks would get washed out even if you  did go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the  scent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss-tracker.\"    \"All right. We'll rustle.\"    Then he called the girls to hurry.        CHAPTER VIII    Once astride the horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not  being so crippled as she had imagined. Indeed, Bo made all the audible  complaints.    Both girls had long water-proof coats, brand-new, and of which they were  considerably proud. New clothes had not been a common event in their  lives.    \"Reckon I'll have to slit these,\" Dale had said, whipping out a huge  knife.    \"What for?\" had been Bo's feeble protest.    \"They wasn't made for ridin'. An' you'll get wet enough even if I do cut  them. An' if I don't, you'll get soaked.\"    \"Go ahead,\" had been Helen's reluctant permission.    So their long new coats were slit half-way up the back. The exigency of  the case was manifest to Helen, when she saw how they came down over the  cantles of the saddles and to their boot-tops.    The morning was gray and cold. A fine, misty rain fell and the trees  dripped steadily. Helen was surprised to see the open country again and  that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while. The  country was wide and flat on the right, and to the left it rolled and  heaved along a black, scalloped timber-line. Above this bordering of  the forest low, drifting clouds obscured the mountains. The wind was at  Helen's back and seemed to be growing stronger. Dale and Roy were ahead,  traveling at a good trot, with the pack-animals bunched before them.  Helen and Bo had enough to do to keep up.    The first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery, but  it gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up  all day. She began to welcome the places where the horses walked, but  she disliked the levels. As for the descents, she hated those. Ranger  would not go down slowly and the shake-up she received was unpleasant.  Moreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and  washes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the  knack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person  bruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had  never before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced  in looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been  frightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked  back, for which Helen was grateful.    Before long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable  small hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised  following. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,  coming to a gray-green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the  air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a  low, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,  covering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three  herders on horses and several pack-burros. Dale engaged one of the  Mexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed  northward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,  and Helen caught the quick \"SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!\" It was a pretty  sight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#16)"],[1,"back their votes.    And so it came about that the animals did have a Christmas tree after  all; but instead of hanging lambs and doves upon the tree, they agreed  that they could hang little images of lambs and doves, and other birds  and animals, too, perhaps. And by and by the custom spread until the  humans came to hang the same little images on their trees, too, and  when you see a little figure of a lamb or a dove on the Christmas  tree, you may know that it is all because the lamb and the dove, by  their unselfishness, saved the animals from strife; for neither  thought what he wanted from the tree, but each was ready to give  himself for the others, so that they might not fight and kill one  another at the Christmas time.          A CHRISTMAS CAROL          The Shepherds had an Angel,        The Wise Men had a star,      But what have I, a little child,        To guide me home from far,      Where glad stars sing together        And singing angels are?        Those Shepherds through the lonely night        Sat watching by their sheep,      Until they saw the heavenly host        Who neither tire nor sleep,      All singing \"Glory, glory,\"        In festival they keep.        The Wise Men left their country        To journey morn by morn,      With gold and frankincense and myrrh,        Because the Lord was born:      God sent a star to guide them        And sent a dream to warn.        My life is like their journey,        Their star is like God's book;      I must be like those good Wise Men        With heavenward heart and look:      But shall I give no gifts to God?--        What precious gifts they took!                            Christina Rossetti.          HOLLY    Ada M. Marzials          Highty-tighty, Paradighty,      Clothed all in green.      The King could not read it      No more could the Queen.      They sent for a Wise Man out of the East,      Who said it had horns but was not a beast.                            (_Old Riddle._)    There was once upon a time a very war-like kingdom where they had  never heard of Christmas. The men spent all their days fighting, and  the women spent _their_ days in urging the warriors to further deeds  of valour.    This had gone on for a very long time, and no one had ever yet said  that he was tired of it. There was but one person in the whole kingdom  who had openly declared that war was hateful, but as she was only the  Youngest Princess nobody paid any heed to her.    Then came a time, just before our Christmas Day, when the King was  preparing a great campaign against a far-off country. He called  together his Council of War--grave old warriors, dressed completely in  armour.    \"My friends,\" said he, \"we are about to wage war on the distant  kingdoms of Zowega. Up till this time the people of that country have  been our very good friends, but as we have now conquered all our  enemies, there seems no one but our friends left to fight, and of  these the King of the Zowegians is chief.    \"You will remember that his youngest son, Prince Moldo, spent some of  his boyhood at our court in order to gain instruction in feats of  arms, and that the Prince left us to travel over the world. A few  months ago his father sent word to me that the Prince had returned  home, bringing with him the news of a Pearl of Great Price, which  contained the Secret of Happiness. It is this Pearl which I have made  the excuse for war, for I have demanded it in payment for the  services that we rendered to Prince Moldo. In my message I have said  that if the Pearl, and the Secret which it contains, are not brought  and revealed to us here within the next five days, our troops will  descend upon the kingdom of Zowega and wipe it off the face of the  earth.\"    Loud and long cheered the Council at the speech of their King, as,  indeed, was their duty, though in their hearts of hearts they had no  wish to fight against the King of the Zowegians, who was their very  good friend. The Queen and the Princesses smiled graciously upon them,  all save the Youngest Princess, who had been Prince Moldo's  playfellow. She disgraced herself by bursting into passionate tears,  and was forthwith ordered out of the Council Hall.    At the end of five days the Council once more assembled to await the  arrival of the messenger with the answer from the King of Zowega.    The day was bright and cold, and there was snow on the ground. The  King and Queen were wrapped in thick fur cloaks. The Princesses were  all assembled, too, even the Youngest, who was dressed in ermine and  looked as pale as death.    It was Christmas Eve, but there were no Christmas trees preparing and  no presents. No one was thinking of hanging his stockings up. The Hall  was not decorated, neither were the churches; indeed, there were no  churches to decorate, for, as you remember, the people in this kingdom  knew nothing about Christmas.    The Council sat and waited in the big bare Hall.    At last the great doors were flung open, there was a blast of  trumpets, and the messenger appeared.    He was tall and fair, and held himself proudly. His eyes were bright  and shining and there was a smile upon his face. He was completely  dressed in bright green and the Council noted with astonishment that  he was without armour of any kind. He wore neither breastplate, shield  nor helmet; he had neither sword by his side, nor spurs on his feet.  He was bare-headed, and in his right hand he carried something green,  horny and prickly, with little red dots on it.    Looking neither to the right nor to the left, he walked with firm and  steady step up the long Hall between the rows of armed warriors.    As he passed the Youngest Princess she blushed deeply, but he did not  seem to notice her.    When he reached the throne he bowed low before the King and Queen, and  laid the prickly object on the table before them.    \"Your Majesty,\" said he in a clear, ringing voice. \"From the King of  Zowega, greeting! He sends you this token. It is the symbol of the  Secret of Happiness.\"    The King stared, so did the Queen.    They had expected a Pearl of Great Price, accompanied by a scroll on  which was written the Secret of Happiness, and the King of Zowega had  sent them _this_!    Amid dead silence the King took the token up in his hands in order to  examine it more carefully.    He dropped it hastily, for it pricked him, and little drops of blood  were seen starting from his hand.    \"Highty-tighty!\" said he. \"'Tis surely some kind of beast and a symbol  of war, for it pricked me right smartly. Truly the King of Zowega  deals in riddles which I for one cannot read! Take it, my dear,\" added  he to the Queen and pointing to the token; \"perchance your quick wits  may be able to understand this mystery.\"    She picked up the token and examined it carefully.    It rather resembled the branch of a tree, but the leaves were thick  and resisting and edged with very sharp spikes, and there was on it a  cluster of round, bright red objects like tiny balls. But even as it  had pricked the King so did it prick her, and she dropped it hastily  into the lap of the Eldest Princess, who was sitting beside her.    \"Paradighty!\" exclaimed the Queen in her own language. \"It is  certainly a beast. See, it has horns!\" and she pointed to the spikes.    \"But I certainly cannot read the riddle--if riddle it be.\"    Then it was passed to all the Princesses in turn, but they could not  read the token any more than could the King and Queen. At last it  reached the Youngest Princess, and, though it pricked her little hands  sorely, she took it up tenderly and kissed it.    \"'Tis a token of love,\" said she.    The messenger turned his shining eyes full upon her.    \"The Princess has read the riddle of the token aright,\" said he, and  he stepped forward as though to kiss her hand.    \"Stay!\" said the King imperiously springing to his feet. \"A token of  love, forsooth! But I sent the King of Zowega a Declaration of War!  What does he mean by sending me a token of love? The Princess must  certainly be mistaken--and as for _you_,\" he continued, turning  fiercely to the messenger, \"you shall be marched off to prison until  we have had time to consult with our Wise Men as to the real meaning  of this extraordinary token.\"    So there and then the messenger was marched off to spend the night in  prison, and all the Wise Men in the kingdom were bidden to appear in  the Council Chamber the very next day, especially one very old Wise  Man from the East who was reputed to be wiser than all the others put  together.    The next day, of course, was Christmas Day, but, as these people had  never heard of Christmas, there were no bells ringing, no carols were  sung, and there was neither holly, ivy nor mistletoe upon the walls.    Slowly and painfully the Wise Men began to arrive.    They were all dressed alike, in black flowing robes, and on their  heads they wore long pointed black caps covered with weird devices.    The very old Wise Man from the East wore a red pointed cap, but in all  other respects was dressed just like the others.    They assembled round a large circular table at one end of the Hall. In  the middle of the table was placed the token.    At the other end of the Hall were gathered the warriors, and above  them on a double throne sat the King and Queen with the Princesses  grouped on either side of the dais.    The Wise Men examined the token in silence.    \"'Tis a curious beast,\" said one of them at last.    \"Of a new and quite unheard-of species,\" said another.    \"It has neither legs nor tail,\" said a third.    \"Yet it has a number of globular red eyes,\" said a fourth.    \"And it certainly has horns,\" said a fifth.    And so said they all, until it came to the turn of the very old Wise  Man from the East.    He looked long at the token.    \"It has horns,\" said he at last, \"but it is not a beast.\"    \"Not a beast!\" said they, one to the other.    \"But what "]]]
