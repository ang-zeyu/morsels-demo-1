A little later, along the great Susquehanna, I found in full bloom other  trees of this same birch, beloved of boys--and of girls--for its  aromatic bark. Certainly picturesque and bright, the little trees were a  delight to the winter-wearied eye, the mahogany twigs and the golden  catkins, held at poise over the water, being full of spring suggestion.    All of the birches--I wish I knew them better!--are good to look at, and  I think the bees, the woodpeckers, the humming-birds and other wood folk  must find some of them good otherwise. At Eagles Mere there was a yellow  birch in the bark of which scores of holes had been drilled by the  woodpeckers or the bees, at regularly spaced intervals, to let the  forest life drink at will of the sweet sap. I remember also that my  attempt to photograph a score of bees, two large brown butterflies and  one humming-bird, all in attendance upon this birch feast, was a  surprising failure. I secured a picture of the holes in the bark, to be  sure, but the rapidly moving insect and bird life was too quick for an  exposure of even a fraction of a second, and my negative was lifeless.  These same yellow birches, picturesque in form, ragged in light-colored  bark, give a brightness all their own to the deep forest, mostly of  trees with rather somber bark.    A woodsman told me one summer of the use of old birch bark for starting  a fire in the wet woods, and I have since enjoyed collecting the bark  from fallen trees in the forest. It strips easily, in large pieces, from  decayed stems, and when thrown on an open fire, produces a cheery and  beautiful blaze, as well as much heat; while, if cunningly handled, by  its aid a fire can be kindled even in a heavy rain.    [Illustration: Sweet birch in early spring]    The great North Woods show us wonderful birches. Paddling through one of  the Spectacle ponds, along the Racquette river, one early spring day, I  came upon a combination of white pine, red pine, and paper-birch that  was simply dazzling in effect. This birch has bark, as every one knows,  of a shining creamy white. Not only its color, but its tenacity,  resistance to decay, and wonderful divisibility, make this bark one of  the most remarkable of nature's fabrics. To the Indian and the trapper  it has long been as indispensable as is the palm to the native of the  tropics.    [Illustration: Yellow birches]    There are other good native birches, and one foreigner--the true white  birch--whose cut-leaved form, a familiar lawn tree of drooping habit, is  worth watching and liking. The name some of the nurserymen have given  it, of \"nine-bark,\" is significantly accurate, for at least nine layers  may be peeled from the glossy whiteness of the bark of a mature tree.    I intend to know more of the birches, and to see how the two kinds of  flowers act to produce the little fruits, which are nuts, though they  hardly look so. And I would urge my tree-loving friends to plant about  their homes these cheery and most elegantly garbed trees.    The spice-bush, of which I spoke above, is really a large shrub, and is  especially notable for two things--the way it begins the spring, and  the way it ends the fall. About my home, it is the first of wild woods  trees to bloom, except perhaps the silver maple, which has a way of  getting through with its flowers unnoticed before spring is thought of.  One finds the delicate little bright yellow flowers of the spice-bush  clustered thickly along the twigs long before the leaves are ready to  brave the chill air. After the leaves have fallen in the autumn, these  flowers stand out in a reincarnation of scarlet and spicy berries, which  masquerade continually as holly berries when cunningly introduced amid  the foliage of the latter. Between spring and fall the spice-bush is  apparently invisible.    [Illustration: Flowers of the spice-bush]    [Illustration: Leaves and berries of the American holly]    How many of us, perfectly familiar with \"the holly berry's glow\" about  Christmas time, have ever seen a whole tree of holly, set with berries?  Yet the trees, sometimes fifty feet high, of American holly--and this is  very different from the English holly in leaf--grow all along the  Atlantic sea-board, from Maine to Florida, and are especially plenty  south of Maryland and Delaware. There is one superb specimen in Trenton,  New Jersey's capital, which is of the typical form, and when crowded  with scarlet berries it is an object of great beauty. One reason why  many of us have not seen holly growing in the wild is that it seems to  prefer the roughest and most inaccessible locations. Years ago I was  told that I might see plenty of holly growing freely in the Pennsylvania  county of my home. \"But,\" my informant added, \"you will need to wear  heavy leather trousers to get to it!\" The nurserymen are removing this  difficulty by growing plants of all the hollies--American, Japanese,  English and Himalayan--so that they may easily be set in the home  grounds, with their handsome evergreen foliage and their berries of  red or black.    [Illustration: American holly tree at Trenton, N. J.]    One spring, the season and my opportunities combined to provide a most  pleasing feast of color in the tree quest. It was afforded by the  juxtaposition at Conewago of the bloom-time of the deep pink red-bud,  miscalled \"Judas tree,\" and the large white dogwood,--both set against  the deep, almost black green of the American cedar, or juniper. These  two small trees, the red-bud and the dogwood, are of the class of  admirable American natives that are notable rather for beauty and  brightness of bloom than for tree form or size.    The common dogwood--_Cornus florida_ of the botany--appears in bloom  insidiously, one might say; for the so-called flowers open slowly, and  they are green in color, and easily mistaken for leaves, after they have  attained considerable size. Gradually the green pales to purest white,  and the four broad bracts, with the peculiar little pucker at the end of  each, swell out from the real flowers, which look like stamens, to a  diameter of often four inches. With these flowers clustered thickly on  the usually flat, straight branches, the effect against the green or  brown of near-by trees is startling. The dogwood's horizontal branching  habit makes every scrap of its lovely white blooms effective to the  beholder on the ground below, but far more striking if one may see it  from above, as looking down a hillside.    Though the dogwood blooms before its leaves are put forth, the foliage  sometimes catches up with the flowers; and this foliage is itself a  pleasure, because of its fineness and its regular venation, or marking  with ribs. In the fall, when the flowers of purest white have been  succeeded by oblong berries of brightest scarlet, the foliage remains  awhile to contrast with the brilliance of the fruit. The frosts soon  drop the leaves, and then the berries stand out in all their  attractiveness, offering food to every passing bird, and thus carrying  out another of nature's cunning provisions for the reproduction of the  species. Seeds in the crops of birds travel free and far, and some fall  on good ground!    Is it not sad to know that the brave, bold dogwood, holding out its  spring flag of truce from arduous weather, and its autumn store of  sustenance for our feathered friends, is in danger of extinction from  the forest because its hardy, smooth, even-grained white wood has been  found to be especially available in the \"arts\"? I feel like begging for  the life of every dogwood, as too beautiful to be destroyed for any mere  utility.    [Illustration: Floral bracts or involucres of the dogwood]    I have been wondering as to the reason for the naming of the cornuses as  dogwoods, and find in Bailey's great Cyclopedia of Horticulture the  definite statement that the name was attached to an English red-branched  species because a decoction of the bark was used to wash mangy dogs!  This is but another illustration of the inadequacy and inappropriateness  of \"common\" names.    There are many good dogwoods--the Cornus family is admirable, both in  its American and its foreign members--but I must not become encyclopedic  in these sketches of just a few tree favorites. I will venture to  mention one shrub dogwood--I never heard its common name, but it has  three botanical names (_Cornus sericea_, or _coerulea_, or _Amomum_,  the latter preferred) to make up for the lack. It ought to be called  the blue-berried dogwood, by reason of its extremely beautiful fruit,  which formed a singular and delightful contrast to the profusion of red  and scarlet fruits so much in evidence, one September day, in Boston's  berry-full Franklin Park.    [Illustration: The red-bud in bloom]    The red-bud, as I have said, is miscalled Judas-tree, the tradition  being that it was on a tree of this family, but not of the American  branch, happily and obviously, that the faithless disciple hanged  himself after his final interview with the priests who had played upon  his cupidity. Indeed, tradition is able to tell even now marvelous  stories to travelers, and not long ago I was more amused than edified to  hear an eloquent clergyman just returned from abroad tell how he had  been shown the fruits of the Judas-tree, \"in form like beautiful apples,  fair to the eye, but within bitter and disappointing;\" and he moralized  just as vigorously on this fable as if it had been true, as he thought  it. He didn't particularly relish the suggestion that the pulpit ought  to be fairly certain of its facts, whether of theology or of science, in  these days; but he succumbed to the submission of authority for the  statement that the Eastern so-called Judas-tree, _Cercis siliquastrum_,  bore a small pod, like a bean, and was not unpleasant,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#16)"],[1,"him. The rumor  arose that Asmodeus, the king of demons, was raging among the  inhabitants of the city, and slaying them in large numbers.    After another period of ten days, which he spent in retirement with  his hosts, Joab sallied forth a second time, and caused such  bloodshed among the Amalekites that his gory weapon clave to his  hand, and his right hand lost all power of independent motion, it  could be made to move only in a piece with his arm. He hastened  to his lodging place to apply hot water to his hand and free it from  the sword. On his way thither the woman who had caught him up  when he fell into the city called to him: \"Thou eatest and drinkest  with us, yet thou slayest our warriors.\" Seeing himself betrayed, he  could not but kill the woman. Scarcely had his sword touched her,  when it was separated from his hand, and his hand could move  freely, for the dead woman had been with child, and the blood of  the unborn babe loosed the sword.    After Joab had slain thousands, the Israelites without, at the very  moment when they were beginning to mourn their general as dead,  saw blood issue from the city, and joyfully they cried out with one  accord: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.\" Joab  mounted a high tower, and in stentorian tones shouted: \"The Lord  will not forsake his people.\" Inspired with high and daring  courage, the Israelites demanded permission to assault the city and  capture it. As Joab turned to descend from the tower, he noticed  that six verses of a Psalm were inscribed on his foot, the first verse  running thus: \"The Lord answers thee in the day of trouble, the  name of the God of Jacob is thy defense.\" Later David added three  verses and completed the Psalm. Thereupon the Israelites took the  Amalekite capital, destroyed the heathen temples in the city, and  slew all its inhabitants, except the king, whom, with his crown of  pure gold on his head, they brought before David. (77)      DAVID'S PIETY AND HIS SIN    Neither his great achievements in war nor his remarkable good  fortune moved David from his pious ways, or in aught changed his  mode of life. Even after he became king he sat at the feet of his  teachers, Ira the Jairite (78) and Mephibosheth. To the latter he  always submitted his decisions on religious questions, to make  sure that they were in accordance with law. (79) Whatever leisure  time his royal duties afforded him, he spent in study and prayer.  He contented himself with \"sixty breaths\" of sleep. (80) At  midnight the strings of his harp, (81) which were made of the gut  of the ram sacrificed by Abraham on Mount Moriah, (82) began to  vibrate. The sound they emitted awakened David, and he would  arise at once to devote himself to the study of the Torah. (83)    Besides study, the composition of psalms naturally claimed a  goodly portion of his time. Pride filled his heart when he had  completed the Psalter, and he exclaimed: \"O Lord of the world, is  there another creature in the universe who like me proclaims thy  praise?\" A frog came up to the king, and said: \"Be not so proud; I  have composed more psalms than thou, and, besides, every psalm  my mouth has uttered I have accompanied with three thousand  parables.\" (84) And, truly, if David indulged in conceit, it was only  for a moment. As a rule he was the exemplar of modesty. The  coins which were stamped by him bore a shepherd's crook and  pouch on the obverse, and on the reverse the Tower of David. (85)  In other respects, too, his bearing was humble, as though he were  still the shepherd and not the king. (86)    His great piety invested his prayer with such efficacy that he could  bring things in heaven down to earth. (87) It is natural that so  godly a king should have used the first respite granted by his wars  to carry out his design of erecting a house of worship to God. But  in the very night in which David conceived the plan of building the  Temple, God said to Nathan the prophet: \"Hasten to David. I know  him to be a man with whom execution follows fast upon the heels  of thought, and I should not like him to hire laborers for the  Temple work, and then, disappointed, complain of me. I  furthermore know him to be a man who obligates himself by vows  to do good deeds, and I desire to spare him the embarrassment of  having to apply to the Sanhedrin for absolution from his vow.\"  (88)    When David heard Nathan's message for him, he began to tremble,  and he said: \"Ah, verily, God hath found me unworthy to erect His  sanctuary.\" But God replied with these words: \"Nay, the blood  shed by thee I consider as sacrificial blood, but I do not care to  have thee build the Temple, because then it would be eternal and  indestructible.\" \"But that would be excellent,\" said David.  Whereupon the reply was vouchsafed him: \"I foresee that Israel  will commit sins. I shall wreak My wrath upon the Temple, and  Israel will be saved from annihilation. However, thy good  intentions shall receive their due reward. The Temple, though it be  built by Solomon, shall be called thine.\" (89)    David's thinking and planning were wholly given to what is good  and noble. He is one of the few pious men over whom the evil  inclination had no power. (90) By nature he was not disposed to  commit such evil-doing as his relation to Bath-sheba involved.  God Himself brought him to his crime, that He might say to other  sinners: \"Go to David and learn how to repent.\" (91) Nor, indeed,  may David be charged with gross murder and adultery. There were  extenuating circumstances. In those days it was customary for  warriors to give their wives bills of divorce, which were to have  validity only if the soldier husbands did not return at the end of the  campaign. Uriah having fallen in battle, Bath-sheba was a  regularly divorced woman. As for the death of her husband, it  cannot be laid entirely at David's door, for Uriah had incurred the  death penalty by his refusal to take his ease in his own house,  according to the king's bidding. (92) Moreover, from the first,  Bath-sheba had been destined by God for David, but by way of  punishment for having lightly promised Uriah the Hittite an  Israelitish woman to wife, in return for his aid in unfastening the  armor of the prostrate Goliath, the king had to undergo bitter trials  before he won her. (93)    Furthermore, the Bath-sheba episode was a punishment for David's  excessive self-consciousness. He had fairly besought God to lead  him into temptation, that he might give proof of his constancy. It  came about thus: He once complained to God: \"O Lord of the  world, why do people say God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of  Jacob, and why not God of David?\" The answer came: \"Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob were tried by me, but thou hast not yet been  proved.\" David entreated: \"Then examine me, O Lord, and try me.\"  And God said: \"I shall prove thee, and I shall even grant thee what  I did not grant the Patriarchs. I shall tell thee beforehand that thou  wilt fall into temptation through a woman.\"    Once Satan appeared to him in the shape of a bird. David threw a  dart at him. Instead of striking Satan, it glanced off and broke a  wicker screen which hid Bath-sheba combing her hair. The sight of  her aroused passion in the king. (94) David realized his  transgression, and for twenty-two years he was a penitent. Daily he  wept a whole hour and ate his \"bread with ashes.\" (95) But he had  to undergo still heavier penance. For a half-year he suffered with  leprosy, and even the Sanhedrin, which usually was in close  personal attendance upon him, had to leave him. He lived not only  in physical, but also in spiritual isolation, for the Shekinah  departed from him during that time. (96)      ABSALOM'S REBELLION    Of all the punishments, however, inflicted upon David, none was  so severe as the rebellion of his own son.    Absalom was of such gigantic proportions that a man who was  himself of extraordinary size, standing in the eye-socket of his  skull, sank in down to his nose. (97) As for his marvellous hair, the  account of it in the Bible does not convey a notion of its  abundance. Absalom had taken the vow of a Nazarite. As his vow  was for life, and because the growth of his hair was particularly  heavy, the law permitted him to clip it slightly every week. (98) It  was of this small quantity that the weight amounted to two  hundred shekels.    Absalom arranged for his audacious rebellion with great cunning.  He secured a letter from his royal father empowering him to select  two elders for his suite in every town he visited. With this  document he travelled through the whole of Palestine. In each  town he went to the two most distinguished men, and invited them  to accompany him, at the same time showing them what his father  had written, and assuring them that they had been chosen by him  because he had a particular affection for them. So he succeeded in  gathering the presidents of two hundred courts about him. This  having been accomplished, he arranged a large banquet, at which  he seated one of his emissaries between every two of his guests,  for the purpose of winning them over to his cause. The plan did  not succeed wholly, for, though the elders of the towns stood by  Absalom, in their hearts they hoped for David's victory. (99)    The knowledge that a part of Absalom's following sided with him  in secret,--that, though he was pursued by his son, his friends  remained true to him,--somewhat consoled David in his distress.  He thought that in these circumstances, if the worst came to the  worst, Absalom would at least feel pity for him. (100) At first,  however, the despair of David knew no bounds. He was on the  point of worshipping an idol, when his friend Hushai the Archite  approached him, saying: \"The people will wonder that such a king  should serve idols.\" David replied: \"Should a king such as I am be  killed by his own son? It is better for me to"]]]
