So meybe the  pore thing never see her husban' agin.    Ole' Massa always see that we get plenty to eat. O' course it was no  fancy rashions. Jes corn bread, milk, fat meat, and 'lasses but the Lord  knows that was lots more than other pore niggers got. Some of them had  such bad masters.    Us pore niggers never 'lowed to learn anything. All the readin' they  ever hear was when they was carried through the big Bible. The Massa say  that keep the slaves in they places. They was one nigger boy in Newton  who was terrible smart. He learn to read an' write. He take other  colored children out in the fields and teach 'em about the Bible, but  they forgit it 'fore the nex' Sunday.    Then the paddyrollers they keep close watch on the pore niggers so they  have no chance to do anything or go anywhere. They jes' like policemen,  only worser. 'Cause they never let the niggers go anywhere without a  pass from his master. If you wasn't in your proper place when the  paddyrollers come they lash you til' you was black and blue. The women  got 15 lashes and the men 30. That is for jes bein' out without a pass.  If the nigger done anything worse he was taken to the jail and put in  the whippin' post. They was two holes cut for the arms stretch up in  the air and a block to put your feet in, then they whip you with cowhide  whip. An' the clothes shore never get any of them licks.    I remember how they kill one nigger whippin' him with the bull whip.  Many the pore nigger nearly killed with the bull whip. But this one die.  He was a stubborn Negro and didn't do as much work as his Massa thought  he ought to. He been lashed lot before. So they take him to the whippin'  post, and then they strip his clothes off and then the man stan' off and  cut him with the whip. His back was cut all to pieces. The cuts about  half inch apart. Then after they whip him they tie him down and put salt  on him. Then after he lie in the sun awhile they whip him agin. But when  they finish with him he was dead.    Plenty of the colored women have children by the white men. She know  better than to not do what he say. Didn't have much of that until the  men from South Carolina come up here and settle and bring slaves. Then  they take them very same children what have they own blood and make  slaves out of them. If the Missus find out she raise revolution. But she  hardly find out. The white men not going to tell and the nigger women  were always afraid to. So they jes go on hopin' that thing won't be that  way always.    I remember how the driver, he was the man who did most of the whippin',  use to whip some of the niggers. He would tie their hands together and  then put their hands down over their knees, then take a stick and stick  it 'tween they hands and knees. Then when he take hold of them and beat  'em first on one side then on the other.    Us niggers never have chance to go to Sunday School and church. The  white folks feared for niggers to get any religion and education, but I  reckon somethin' inside jes told us about God and that there was a  better place hereafter. We would sneak off and have prayer meetin'.  Sometimes the paddyrollers catch us and beat us good but that didn't  keep us from tryin'. I remember one old song we use to sing when we meet  down in the woods back of the barn. My mother she sing an' pray to the  Lord to deliver us out o' slavery. She always say she thankful she was  never sold from her children, and that our Massa not so mean as some of  the others. But the old song it went something like this:         \"Oh, mother lets go down, lets go down, lets go down, lets go down.       Oh, mother lets go down, down in the valley to pray.       As I went down in the valley to pray       Studyin' about that good ole way       Who shall wear that starry crown.       Good Lord show me the way.\"    Then the other part was just like that except it said 'father' instead  of 'mother', and then 'sister' and then 'brother'.    Then they sing sometime:         \"We camp a while in the wilderness, in the wilderness, in the          wilderness.       We camp a while in the wilderness, where the Lord makes me happy       And then I'm a goin' home.\"    I don't remember much about the war. There was no fightin' done in  Newton. Jes a skirmish or two. Most of the people get everything jes  ready to run when the Yankee sojers come through the town. This was  toward the las' of the war. Cose the niggers knew what all the fightin'  was about, but they didn't dare say anything. The man who owned the  slaves was too mad as it was, and if the niggers say anything they get  shot right then and thar. The sojers tell us after the war that we get  food, clothes, and wages from our Massas else we leave. But they was  very few that ever got anything. Our ole Massa say he not gwine pay us  anything, corse his money was no good, but he wouldn't pay us if it had  been.    Then the Ku Klux Klan come 'long. They were terrible dangerous. They  wear long gowns, touch the ground. They ride horses through the town at  night and if they find a Negro that tries to get nervy or have a little  bit for himself, they lash him nearly to death and gag him and leave him  to do the bes' he can. Some time they put sticks in the top of the tall  thing they wear and then put an extra head up there with scary eyes and  great big mouth, then they stick it clear up in the air to scare the  poor Negroes to death.    They had another thing they call the 'Donkey Devil' that was jes as bad.  They take the skin of a donkey and get inside of it and run after the  pore Negroes. Oh, Miss them was bad times, them was bad times. I know  folks think the books tell the truth, but they shore don't. Us pore  niggers had to take it all.    Then after the war was over we was afraid to move. Jes like tarpins or  turtles after 'mancipation. Jes stick our heads out to see how the land  lay. My mammy stay with Marse Jonah for 'bout a year after freedom then  ole Solomon Hall made her an offer. Ole man Hall was a good man if there  ever was one. He freed all of his slaves about two years 'fore  'mancipation and gave each of them so much money when he died, that is  he put that in his will. But when he die his sons and daughters never  give anything to the pore Negroes. My mother went to live on the place  belongin' to the nephew of Solomon Hall. All of her six children went  with her. Mother she cook for the white folks an' the children make  crop. When the first year was up us children got the first money we had  in our lives. My mother certainly was happy.    We live on this place for over four years. When I was 'bout twenty year  old I married a girl from West Virginia but she didn't live but jes  'bout a year. I stayed down there for a year or so and then I met  Mamie. We came here and both of us went to work, we work at the same  place. We bought this little piece of ground 'bout forty-two years ago.  We gave $125 for it. We had to buy the lumber to build the house a  little at a time but finally we got the house done. Its been a good home  for us and the children. We have two daughters and one adopted son. Both  of the girls are good cooks. One of them lives in New Jersey and cooks  in a big hotel. She and her husband come to see us about once a year.  The other one is in Philadelphia. They both have plenty. But the adopted  boy, he was part white. We took him when he was a small and did the best  we could by him. He never did like to 'sociate with colored people. I  remember one time when he was a small child I took him to town and the  conductor made me put him in the front of the street car cause he  thought I was just caring for him and that he was a white boy. Well, we  sent him to school until he finished. Then he joined the navy. I ain't  seem him in several years. The last letter I got from him he say he  ain't spoke to a colored girl since he has been there. This made me mad  so I took his insurance policy and cashed it. I didn't want nothin' to  do with him, if he deny his own color.    Very few of the Negroes ever get anywhere; they never have no education.  I knew one Negro who got to be a policeman in Salisbury once and he was  a good one too. When my next birthday comes in December I will be  eighty-eight years old. That is if the Lord lets me live and I shore  hope He does.          N. C.

In 1713, 1715, and 1727,  Massachusetts determined upon a policy of locating towns in advance of  settlement, to protect her boundary claims. In 1736 she laid out five  towns near the New Hampshire border, and a year earlier opened four  contiguous towns to connect her Housatonic and Connecticut Valley  settlements.[76:1] Grants in non-adjacent regions were sometimes made to  old towns, the proprietors of which sold them to those who wished to  move.    The history of the town of Litchfield illustrates the increasing  importance of the economic factor. At a time when Connecticut feared  that Andros might dispose of the public lands to the disadvantage of the  colony, the legislature granted a large part of Western Connecticut to  the towns of Hartford and Windsor, _pro forma_, as a means of  withdrawing the lands from his hands. But these towns refused to give up  the lands after the danger had passed, and proceeded to sell part of  them.[76:2] Riots occurred when the colonial authorities attempted to  assert possession, and the matter was at length compromised in 1719 by  allowing Litchfield to be settled in accordance with the town grants,  while the colony reserved the larger part of northwestern Connecticut.  In 1737 the colony disposed of its last unlocated lands by sale in lots.  In 1762 Massachusetts sold a group of entire townships in the Berkshires  to the highest bidders.[77:1]    But the most striking illustration of the tendency, is afforded by the  \"New Hampshire grants\" of Governor Wentworth, who, chiefly in the years  about 1760, made grants of a hundred and thirty towns west of the  Connecticut, in what is now the State of Vermont, but which was then in  dispute between New Hampshire and New York. These grants, while in form  much like other town grants, were disposed of for cash, chiefly to  speculators who hastened to sell their rights to the throngs of  land-seekers who, after the peace, began to pour into the Green Mountain  region.    It is needless to point out how this would affect the movement of  Western settlement in respect to individualistic speculation in public  lands; how it would open a career to the land jobbers, as well as to the  natural leaders in the competitive movement for acquiring the best  lands, for laying out town sites and building up new communities under  \"boom\" conditions. The migratory tendency of New Englanders was  increased by this gradual change in its land policy; the attachment to a  locality was diminished. The later years showed increasing emphasis by  New England upon individual success, greater respect for the self-made  man who, in the midst of opportunities under competitive conditions,  achieved superiority. The old dominance of town settlement, village  moral police, and traditional class control gave way slowly. Settlement  in communities and rooted Puritan habits and ideals had enduring  influences in the regions settled by New Englanders; but it was in this  Old West, in the years just before the Revolution, that individualism  began to play an important role, along with the traditional habit of  expanding in organized communities.    The opening of the Vermont towns revealed more fully than before, the  capability of New Englanders to become democratic pioneers, under  characteristic frontier conditions. Their economic life was simple and  self-sufficing. They readily adopted lynch law (the use of the \"birch  seal\" is familiar to readers of Vermont history) to protect their land  titles in the troubled times when these \"Green Mountain Boys\" resisted  New York's assertion of authority. They later became an independent  Revolutionary state with frontier directness, and in very many respects  their history in the Revolutionary epoch is similar to that of settlers  in Kentucky and Tennessee, both in assertion of the right to independent  self government and in a frontier separatism.[78:1] Vermont may be  regarded as the culmination of the frontier movement which I have been  describing in New England.    By this time two distinct New Englands existed--the one coastal, and  dominated by commercial interests and the established congregational  churches; the other a primitive agricultural area, democratic in  principle, and with various sects increasingly indifferent to the fear  of \"innovation\" which the dominant classes of the old communities felt.  Already speculative land companies had begun New England settlements in  the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania, as well as on the lower Mississippi;  and New England missions among the Indians, such as that at Stockbridge,  were beginning the noteworthy religious and educational expansion of the  section to the west.    That this movement of expansion had been chiefly from south to north,  along the river valleys, should not conceal from us the fact that it was  in essential characteristics a Western movement, especially in the  social traits that were developing. Even the men who lived in the long  line of settlements on the Maine coast, under frontier conditions, and  remote from the older centers of New England, developed traits and a  democratic spirit that relate them closely to the Westerners, in spite  of the fact that Maine is \"down east\" by preeminence.[79:1]    The frontier of the Middle region in this period of the formation of the  Old West, was divided into two parts, which happen to coincide with the  colonies of New York and Pennsylvania. In the latter colony the trend of  settlement was into the Great Valley, and so on to the Southern uplands;  while the advance of settlement in New York was like that of New  England, chiefly northward, following the line of Hudson River.    The Hudson and the Mohawk constituted the area of the Old West in this  part of the eighteenth century. With them were associated the Wallkill,  tributary to the Hudson, and Cherry Valley near the Mohawk, along the  sources of the Susquehanna. The Berkshires walled the Hudson in to the  east; the Adirondacks and the Catskills to the west. Where the Mohawk  Valley penetrated between the mountainous areas, the Iroquois Indians  were too formidable for advance on such a slender line. Nothing but  dense settlement along the narrow strip of the Hudson, if even that,  could have furnished the necessary momentum for overcoming the Indian  barrier; and this pressure was lacking, for the population was  comparatively sparse in contrast with the task to be performed. What  most needs discussion in the case of New York, therefore, is not the  history of expansion as in other sections, but the absence of expansive  power.    The fur-trade had led the way up the Hudson, and made beginnings of  settlements at strategic points near the confluence of the Mohawk. But  the fur-trader was not followed by a tide of pioneers. One of the most  important factors in restraining density of population in New York, in  retarding the settlement of its frontier, and in determining the  conditions there, was the land system of that colony.    From the time of the patroon grants along the lower Hudson, great  estates had been the common form of land tenure. Rensselaerswyck reached  at one time over seven hundred thousand acres. These great patroon  estates were confirmed by the English governors, who in their turn  followed a similar policy. By 1732 two and one-half million acres were  engrossed in manorial grants.[80:1] In 1764, Governor Colden wrote[80:2]  that three of the extravagant grants contain,         as the proprietors claim, above a million acres each, several       others above 200,000. * * * Although these grants contain a       great part of the province, they are made in trifling       acknowledgements. The far greater part of them still remain       uncultivated, without any benefit to the community, and are       likewise a discouragement to the settling and improving the       lands in the neighborhood of them, for from the uncertainty of       their boundaries, the patentees of these great tracts are       daily enlarging their pretensions, and by tedious and most       expensive law suits, distress and ruin poor families who have       taken out grants near them.    He adds that \"the proprietors of the great tracts are not only freed  from the quit-rents, which the other landholders in the province pay,  but by their influence in the assembly are freed from every other public  tax on their lands.\"    In 1769 it was estimated that at least five-sixths of the inhabitants of  Westchester County lived within the bounds of the great manors  there.[81:1] In Albany County the Livingston manor spread over seven  modern townships, and the great Van Rensselaer manor stretched  twenty-four by twenty-eight miles along the Hudson; while still farther,  on the Mohawk, were the vast possessions of Sir William Johnson.[81:2]    It was not simply that the grants were extensive, but that the policy  of the proprietors favored the leasing rather than the sale of the  lands--frequently also of the stock, and taking payment in shares. It  followed that settlers preferred to go to frontiers where a more liberal  land policy prevailed. At one time it seemed possible that the tide of  German settlement, which finally sought Pennsylvania and the up-country  of the South, might flow into New York. In 1710, Governor Hunter  purchased a tract in Livingston's manor and located nearly fifteen  hundred Palatines on it to produce naval stores.[82:1] But the attempt  soon failed; the Germans applied to the Indians on Schoharie Creek, a  branch of the Mohawk, for a grant of land and migrated there, only to  find that the governor had already granted the land. Again were the  villages broken up, some remaining and some moving farther up the  Mohawk, where they and accessions to their number established the  frontier settlements about Palatine Bridge, in the region where, in the  Revolution, Herkimer led these German frontiersmen to stem "]]]
