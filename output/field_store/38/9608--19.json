[Music]    Pretty _Floramel_, no Tongue can ever tell,    The Charms that in thee dwell;        Those Soul-melting Pleasures,  Shou'd the mighty _Jove_ once view, he'd be in Love,  And plunder all above,        To rain down his Treasure:  Ah! said the Nymph in the Shepherd's Arms,  Had you half so much Love as you say I have Charms;    There's not a Soul, created for Man and Love,    More true than _Floramel_ wou'd prove,    I'd o'er the World with thee rove.    Love that's truly free, had never Jealousie,    But artful Love may be        Both doubtful and wooing;  Ah! dear Shepherdess, ne'er doubt, for you may guess,  My Heart will prove no less,        Than ever endless loving:  Then cries the Nymph, like the Sun thou shalt be,  And I, like kind Earth, will produce all to thee;    Of ev'ry Flower in Love's Garden I'll Off'rings pay    To my Saint. Nay then pray    Take not those dear Eyes away.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ ROBERT KING.      [Music]    By shady Woods and purling Streams,  I spend my Life in pleasing Dreams;  And would not for the World be thought  To change my false delightful Thought:  For who, alas! can happy be,  That does the Truth of all things see?  _For who, alas! can happy be,_  _That does the Truth of all things see._          _A_ SONG. _Sett by Mr._ HENRY PURCELL.      [Music]    In _Chloris_ all soft Charms agree,    Enchanting Humour pow'rful Wit;  Beauty from Affectation free,    And for Eternal Empire fit:  Where-e'er she goes, Love waits her Eyes,    The Women Envy, Men adore;  Tho' did she less the Triumph Prize,    She wou'd deserve the Conquest more.    But Vanity so much prevails,    She begs what else none can deny her;  And with inviting treach'rous Smiles    Gives hopes which ev'n prevent desire:  Reaches at every trifling Heart,    Grows warm with ev'ry glimm'ring Flame:  And common Prey so deads her Dart,    It scarce can wound a noble Game.    I could lye Ages at her Feet,    Adore her careless of my Pain;  With tender Vows her Rigour meet,    Despair, love on, and not complain:  My Passion from all change secur'd,    Favours may rise, no Frown controuls;  I any Torment can endure,    But hoping with a crowd of Fools.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ THO. FARMER.      [Music]    When busie Fame o'er all the Plain,    _Velinda's_ Praises rung;  And on their Oaten Pipes each Swain    Her matchless Beauty sung:  The Envious Nymphs were forc'd to yield    She had the sweetest Face;  No emulous disputes were held,    But for the second place.    Young _Coridon_, whose stubborn Heart    No Beauty e'er could move;  But smil'd at _Cupid's_ Bow and Dart,    And brav'd the God of Love:  Would view this Nymph, and pleas'd at first,    Such silent Charms to see:  With Wonder gaz'd, then sigh'd, and curs'd    His Curiosity.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ FISHBURNE.      [Music]    Why am I the only Creature,    Must a ruin'd Love pursue;  Other Passions yield to Nature,    Mine there's nothing can subdue:  Not the Glory of Possessing,    Monarch wishes gave me ease,  More and more the mighty Blessings    Did my raging Pains encrease.    Nor could Jealousie relieve me,    Tho' it ever waited near;  Cloath'd in gawdy Pow'r to grieve me,    Still the Monster would appear:  That, nor Time, nor Absence neither,    Nor Despair removes my Pain;  I endure them all together,    Yet my Torments still remain.    Had alone her matchless beauty,    Set my amorous Heart on Fire,  Age at last would do its Duty,    Fuel ceasing, Flames expire.  But her Mind immortal grows,    Makes my Love immortal too;  Nature ne'er created Faces,    Can the Charms of Souls undoe.    And to make my Loss the greater,    She laments it as her own;  Could she scorn me, I might hate her,    But alas! she shews me none:  Then since Fortune is my Ruin,    In Retirement I'll Complain;  And in rage for my undoing,    Ne'er come in its Power again.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    _Laurinda_, who did love Disdain,  For whom had languish'd many a Swain:  Leading her bleating Flocks to drink,  She 'spy'd upon a River's brink  A Youth, whose Eyes did well declare,  How much he lov'd, but lov'd not her.    At first she laugh'd, but gaz'd a while,  Which soon it lessen'd to a smile;  Thence to Surprize and Wonder came,  Her Breast to heave, her Heart to flame:  Then cry'd she out, Ah! now I prove  Thou art a God most mighty _Jove_.    She would have spoke, but shame deny'd,  And bid her first consult her Pride;  But soon she found that aid was gone,  For _Jove_, alass! had left her none:  Ah! now she burns! but 'tis too late,  For in his Eyes she reads her Fate.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    Fair _Caelia_ too fondly contemns those Delights,  Wherewith gentle Nature hath soften'd the Nights;  If she be so kind to present us with Pow'r,  The Fault is our own to neglect the good Hour:  Who gave thee this Beauty, ordain'd thou should'st be,  As kind to thy Slaves, as the Gods were to thee.    Then _Caelia_ no longer reserve the vain Pride,  Of wronging thy self, to see others deny'd;  If Love be a Pleasure, alass! you will find,  We both are not happy, when both are most kind:  But Women, like Priests, do in others reprove,  And call that thing Lust, which in them is but Love.    What they thro' their Madness and Folly create,  We poor silly Slaves still impute to our Fate;  But in such Distempers where Love is the Grief,  'Tis _Caelia_, not Heaven, must give us Relief:  Then away with those Titles of Honour and Cause,  Which first made us sin, by giving us Laws.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ WILLIAM TURNER.      [Music]    I Lik'd, but never Lov'd before    I saw that charming Face;  Now every Feature I adore,    And doat on ev'ry Grace:  She ne'er shall know that kind desire,    Which her cold Looks denies,  Unless my Heart that's all on Fire,    Should sparkle through my Eyes:  Then if no gentle Glance return,    A silent Leave to speak;  My Heart which would for ever burn,    Alass! must sigh and break.          _A_ SONG _in_ Valentinian.      [Music]    Where would coy _Amyntas_ run,    From a despairing Lover's Story?  When her Eyes have Conquest won,    Why should her Ear refuse the Glory:  Shall a Slave, whose Racks constrain,  Be forbidden to complain;  Let her scorn me, let her Fly me,  Let her Looks, her Love deny me:  Ne'er shall my Heart yield to despair,  Or my Tongue cease to tell my Care,  Or my Tongue cease to tell my Care:  Much to love, and much to pray,  Is to Heav'n the only way.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ Pelham Humphreys.      [Music]      A Wife I do hate,  For either she's False, or she's Jealous;    But give me a Mate,  Who nothing will ask us or tell us:    She stands at no Terms,  Nor Chaffers by way of Indenture:    Or Loves for the Farms,  But takes the kind Man at a Venture.      If all prove not right,  Without an Act, Process or Warning,    From Wife for a Night,  You may be divorc'd the next Morning,    Where Parents are Slaves,  Their Brats can't be any other;    Great Wits and great Braves,  Have always a Punk to their Mother.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    Tell me ye _Sicilian_ Swains,  Why this Mourning's o'er your Plains;      Where's your usual Melody?  Why are all your Shepherds mad,  And your Shepherdesses sad?      What can the mighty meaning be?    _Chorus._ _Sylvia_ the Glory of our Plains;    _Sylvia_ the Love of all our Swains;      That blest us with her Smiles:  Where ev'ry Shepherd had a Heart,  And ev'ry Shepherdess a Part;      Slights our Gods, and leaves our Isle,      Slights our Gods, and leaves our Isle.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    When gay _Philander_ left the Plain,  The Love, the Life of ev'ry Swain;  His Pipe the mournful _Strephon_ took,  By some sad Bank and murm'ring Brook:  Whilst list'ning Flocks forsook their Food,  And Melancholy by him stood;  On the cold Ground himself he laid,  And thus the Mournful Shepherd play'd.    Farewel to all that's bright and gay,  No more glad Night and chearing Day;  No more the Sun will gild our Plain,  'Till the lost Youth return again:  Then every pensive Heart that now,  With Mournful Willow shades his Brow;  Shall crown'd with chearful Garlands sing,  And all shall seem Eternal Spring.    Say, mighty _Pan_, if you did know,  Say all ye rural Gods below;  'Mongst all Youths that grac'd your Plain,  So gay so beautiful a Swain:  In whose sweet Air and charming Voice,  Our list'ning Swains did all Rejoyce;  Him only, O ye Gods! restore  Your Nymphs, and Shepherds ask no more.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ THO. KINGSLEY.      [Music]    How Happy's the Mortal whose Heart is his own,  And for his own Quiet's beholden to none,          (_Eccho._ Beholden to none, to none;)  That to Love's Enchantments ne'er lendeth an Ear,  Which a Frown or a Smile can equally bear,          (_Eccho._ Can equally bear, can bear,)  Nor on ev'ry frail Beauty still fixes an Eye,  But from those sly Felons doth prudently fly,          (_Eccho._ Doth prudently, prudently fly, doth fly;)  For the Heart that still wanders is pounded at last,  And 'tis hard to relieve it when once it is fast,          (_Eccho._ When once it is fast, is fast.)    By sporting with Dangers still longer and longer,  The Fetters and Chains of the Captive grows stronger;  He drills on his Evil, then curses his Fate,  And bewails those Misfortunes himself did create:  Like an empty Camelion he lives on the Air,  And all the Day lingers 'twixt Hope and Despair;  Like a Fly in the Candle he sports and he Games,  'Till a Victim in Folly, he dies in the Flames.    If Love, so much talk'd of, a Heresie be,  Of all it enslaves few true Converts we see;  If hectoring and huffing would once do the Feat,  There's few that would fail of a Vict'ry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],[0,"Ten Years Later (#16)"],[1," Buckingham.    \"One moment more, for I have yet another word to add. I trust I am the  only one of my companions who has guessed it.\"    \"Are you aware, monsieur,\" said Buckingham, trembling with mingled  feelings of anger and uneasiness, \"are you aware that you are holding  language towards me which requires to be checked?\"    \"Weigh your words well, my lord,\" said Raoul, haughtily; \"my nature is  not such that its vivacities need checking; whilst you, on the contrary,  are descended from a race whose passions are suspected by all true  Frenchmen; I repeat, therefore, for the second time, be careful!\"    \"Careful of what, may I ask? Do you presume to threaten me?\"    \"I am the son of the Comte de la Fere, my lord, and I never threaten,  because I strike first. Therefore, understand me well, the threat that I  hold out to you is this--\"    Buckingham clenched his hands, but Raoul continued, as though he had not  observed the gesture. \"At the very first word, beyond the respect and  deference due to her royal highness, which you permit yourself to use  towards her,--be patient my lord, for I am perfectly so.\"    \"You?\"    \"Undoubtedly. So long as Madame remained on English territory, I held  my peace; but from the very moment she stepped on French ground, and now  that we have received her in the name of the prince, I warn you, that  at the first mark of disrespect which you, in your insane attachment,  exhibit towards the royal house of France, I shall have one of two  courses to follow;--either I declare, in the presence of every one, the  madness with which you are now affected, and I get you ignominiously  ordered back to England; or if you prefer it, I will run my dagger  through your throat in the presence of all here. This second alternative  seems to me the least disagreeable, and I think I shall hold to it.\"    Buckingham had become paler than the lace collar around his neck. \"M.  de Bragelonne,\" he said, \"is it, indeed, a gentleman who is speaking to  me?\"    \"Yes; only the gentleman is speaking to a madman. Get cured, my lord,  and he will hold quite another language to you.\"    \"But, M. de Bragelonne,\" murmured the duke, in a voice, half-choked, and  putting his hand to his neck,--\"Do you not see I am choking?\"    \"If your death were to take place at this moment, my lord,\" replied  Raoul, with unruffled composure, \"I should, indeed, regard it as a  great happiness, for this circumstance would prevent all kinds of evil  remarks; not alone about yourself, but also about those illustrious  persons whom your devotion is compromising in so absurd a manner.\"    \"You are right, you are right,\" said the young man, almost beside  himself. \"Yes, yes; better to die, than to suffer as I do at this  moment.\" And he grasped a beautiful dagger, the handle of which was  inlaid with precious stones; and which he half drew from his breast.    Raoul thrust his hand aside. \"Be careful what you do,\" he said; \"if you  do not kill yourself, you commit a ridiculous action; and if you were to  kill yourself, you sprinkle blood upon the nuptial robe of the princess  of England.\"    Buckingham remained a minute gasping for breath; during this interval,  his lips quivered, his fingers worked convulsively, and his eyes  wandered, as though in delirium. Then suddenly, he said, \"M. de  Bragelonne, I know nowhere a nobler mind than yours; you are, indeed,  a worthy son of the most perfect gentleman that ever lived. Keep your  tents.\" And he threw his arms round Raoul's neck. All who were present,  astounded at this conduct, which was the very reverse of what was  expected, considering the violence of the one adversary and the  determination of the other, began immediately to clap their hands, and  a thousand cheers and joyful shouts arose from all sides. De Guiche, in  his turn, embraced Buckingham somewhat against his inclination; but,  at all events, he did embrace him. This was the signal for French and  English to do the same; and they who, until that moment, had looked at  each other with restless uncertainty, fraternized on the spot. In the  meantime, the procession of the princess arrived, and had it not been  for Bragelonne, two armies would have been engaged together in conflict,  and blood would have been shed upon the flowers with which the ground  was covered. At the appearance, however, of the banners borne at the  head of the procession, complete order was restored.        Chapter XI. Night.    Concord returned to its place amidst the tents. English and French  rivaled each other in their devotion and courteous attention to the  illustrious travelers. The English forwarded to the French baskets  of flowers, of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the  arrival of the young princess; the French in return invited the English  to a supper, which was to be given the next day. Congratulations were  poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey. From the  respect paid her on all sides, she seemed like a queen; and from the  adoration with which she was treated by two or three; she appeared  an object of worship. The queen-mother gave the French the most  affectionate reception. France was her native country, and she had  suffered too much unhappiness in England for England to have made her  forget France. She taught her daughter, then, by her own affection  for it, that love for a country where they had both been hospitably  received, and where a brilliant future opened before them. After the  public entry was over, and the spectators in the streets had partially  dispersed, and the sound of the music and cheering of the crowd could be  heard only in the distance; when the night had closed in, wrapping with  its star-covered mantle the sea, the harbor, the town, and surrounding  country, De Guiche, still excited by the great events of the day,  returned to his tent, and seated himself upon one of the stools with so  profound an expression of distress that Bragelonne kept his eyes fixed  upon him, until he heard him sigh, and then he approached him. The count  had thrown himself back on his seat, leaning his shoulders against the  partition of the tent, and remained thus, his face buried in his hands,  with heaving chest and restless limbs.    \"You are suffering?\" asked Raoul.    \"Cruelly.\"    \"Bodily, I suppose?\"    \"Yes; bodily.\"    \"This has indeed been a harassing day,\" continued the young man, his  eyes fixed upon his friend.    \"Yes; a night's rest will probably restore me.\"    \"Shall I leave you?\"    \"No; I wish to talk to you.\"    \"You shall not speak to me, Guiche, until you have first answered my  questions.\"    \"Proceed then.\"    \"You will be frank with me?\"    \"I always am.\"    \"Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent?\"    \"I suspect.\"    \"Because he is in love with Madame, is it not?\"    \"One could almost swear to it, to observe him.\"    \"You are mistaken; there is nothing of the kind.\"    \"It is you who are mistaken, Raoul; I have read his distress in his  eyes, in his every gesture and action the whole day.\"    \"You are a poet, my dear count, and find subjects for your muse  everywhere.\"    \"I can perceive love clearly enough.\"    \"Where it does not exist?\"    \"Nay, where it does exist.\"    \"Do you not think you are deceiving yourself, Guiche?\"    \"I am convinced of what I say,\" said the count.    \"Now, inform me, count,\" said Raoul, fixing a penetrating look upon him,  \"what happened to render you so clear-sighted.\"    Guiche hesitated for a moment, and then answered, \"Self-love, I  suppose.\"    \"Self-love is a pedantic word, Guiche.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that, generally, you are less out of spirits than seems to be  the case this evening.\"    \"I am fatigued.\"    \"Listen to me, Guiche; we have been campaigners together; we have been  on horseback for eighteen hours at a time, and our horses dying from  exhaustion, or hunger, have fallen beneath us, and yet we have  laughed at our mishaps. Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you  to-night.\"    \"It is annoyance, then.\"    \"What annoyance?\"    \"That of this evening.\"    \"The mad conduct of the Duke of Buckingham, do you mean?\"    \"Of course; is it not vexations for us, the representatives of our  sovereign master, to witness the devotion of an Englishman to our future  mistress, the second lady in point of rank in the kingdom?\"    \"Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended  from Buckingham.\"    \"No; still he is intrusive. Did he not, on his arrival here, almost  succeed in creating a disturbance between the English and ourselves;  and, had it not been for you, for your admirable presence, for your  singular decision of character, swords would have been drawn in the very  streets of the town.\"    \"You observe, however, that he has changed his tactics.\"    \"Yes, certainly; but this is the very thing that amazes me so much. You  spoke to him in a low tone of voice, what did you say to him? You think  he loves her; you admit that such a passion does not give way readily.  He does not love her, then!\" De Guiche pronounced the latter with so  marked an expression that Raoul raised his head. The noble character of  the young man's countenance expressed a displeasure which could easily  be read.    \"What I said to him, count,\" replied Raoul, \"I will repeat to you.  Listen to me. I said, 'You are regarding with wistful feelings, and most  injurious desire, the sister of your prince,--her to whom you are  not affianced, who is not, who can never be anything to you; you are  outraging those who, like ourselves, have come to seek a young lady to  escort her to her husband.'\"    \"You spoke to him in that manner?\" asked Guiche, coloring.    \"In those very terms; I even added more. 'How would you regard us,'  I said, 'if you were to perceive among us a man mad enough, disloyal  enough, to entertain other than sentiments of the most perfect respect  for a princess who is the destined wife"]]]
