It was objected by this gentleman, that  while the activity of the Governor was not to be disputed, exertions  wisely directed were alone worthy of praise; and he compared the project  for netting the aborigines, with an attempt to harpoon a whale from the  heights of Mount Wellington. The ardour of the people would not,  however, admit a comparison which it required at that moment some  political resentment to perceive. Nor is it precisely just to estimate  the merits of a plan, by the success of its application. A colonist at a  glance sees, in the names which were attached to the addresses, that the  war was popular: all parties, of every shade, contributed something to  that warmth of commendation, which had been hitherto paid by one alone.  In every district of the colony, the applauses of Hobart Town were  re-echoed, and the Governor's replies gave back an exchange of praise.    To suppose that Colonel Arthur expected military renown from such an  enterprise, is certainly to under-estimate his ambition: to imagine that  he valued a military spectacle, is not consistent with a mind much too  practical for chivalry. His avowed and real object was to stop the  murder of his countrymen, and to arrest the extinction of the natives;  and it was not unworthy the public gratitude.[18] The Governor was  delighted, however, by those proofs of the discipline of the prisoners,  which were afforded through the campaign: many hundreds were in arms:  they performed their duty with exemplary diligence and sobriety, and  thus afforded the only spectacle which Colonel Arthur valued. It was  certainly unprecedented. Slaves have been armed by their masters--their  wives and children were hostages--but convicts, never. Robberies were  less frequent than usual, and the journals singularly free from the  details of crime. The animating influence of confidence reposed,  elevates the least romantic natures: since they were trusted, they were  faithful: all returned home to their servitude.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 17: The sheriff, Mr. Dudley Fereday, had before dismissed that  portion which guarded the gaol: he affected to believe that the  prisoners were not safe. There was small chance of escaping, so observed  the newspapers, while the civilians were on guard--the prisoners  themselves had given up all hope! But the sheriff thought otherwise, or  more probably availed himself of his office, to cast into the dirt the  honors of the civic guard; who had observed the forms of military  discipline, and who merited a more distinguished termination to their  service.]        SECTION VII.    While the hostile proceeding was in progress, the future preserver of  the natives, Mr. Robinson, had already given his thoughts to their  conciliation. In 1829, he was appointed to take charge of Brune Island,  where twelve natives, captured, were located, and mixed with others who  had attained a partial civilisation. Mr. Robinson attempted to acquire  their language, and was soon able to understand them. The pecuniary  advantages of his office were not very alluring: L50 a-year, and  rations, were thought equal to obtain a person of good character to  manage the infant establishment, and to effect the proposed intercourse  with this unfortunate race. Mr. Robinson described his plan, _as the  employment of persuasion only_, and requiring the withdrawment of  intimidation. He first laboured to acquire the language--a task of some  difficulty: the English were scarcely less ignorant on this subject,  than when they first landed, and the dialects of the tribes differed  considerably. The aborigines were supposed to understand the English  tongue much more extensively; but the words with which they were most  familiar, were the imprecations so often addressed to them--they were  able to retort common terms of menace. Their intercourse with  bushrangers and stock-keepers on remote stations, was the chief source  of their knowledge. To learn the language as an instrument of  civilisation, would be the first idea of a Christian missionary; but it  was a conception, too lofty for the colonial mind. It was forgotten that  by no other means can savages be softened, or permanently conciliated.  The effect, when adopted, was electric: they learned to address Mr.  Robinson as their _marmanake_, or father, and thus to distinguish him  from other white men. The stupidity attributed to barbarians, and the  vacant laughter, with which they receive the announcement of new ideas  in a foreign tongue, would be ascribed, by experienced teachers, to the  absurdity of such a medium of communication.[19]    The plan adopted by Mr. Robinson, was not only humane--it was  reasonable. The natives were proud of freedom: their restraint was  disguised, and by unvarying kindness he taught them to regard him as  their friend; and thus they were prepared, not only to submit to his  authority, but to rely upon his promises. White men had thought it a  merit to deceive, and it required some skill to convince them. Having  explained the proposals of the government, he took with him several of  their number, and went on his errand of mercy. The aborigines were  evidently prepared for his mission. Most of the tribes had occasionally  direct intercourse with Europeans--true, the more frequent, the more  hostile; but while they regarded the whites with hatred, this commerce  enabled them to appreciate the presents provided to entice them, and  facilitated friendly communication. All on the east side of the island  were confederated; and when any were gained, they became agents in each  other's pacification. The late pursuit, though it had not subdued their  enmity, or even their courage, had convinced many that there was no  security but by peace. Others, however, long resolved to confide in  their own strength, and to take refuge in the fastnesses of the island.  Such was the answer they gave to the messages of Robinson; but the late  events had separated them from each other--it had scattered their  tribes: members of the same family were part in captivity, and the  knowledge of their condition moved the sympathies of relations still at  large. Of this, an affecting instance transpired in 1831. Some, who gave  themselves up, stated that they had been very unhappy: they had gone  over the country, searching for their lost friends, of whom they could  gain no tidings. We realise a softening scene, in contemplating these  fragmentary tribes, traversing their ancient haunts, and uttering the  unanswered, and then melancholy call which distinguishes their race.  When this party were told that their relations were living under the  protection of Robinson, they expressed an anxious wish to join them, and  met them with exclamations of joy.    The numerous islands that surround the coast, greatly facilitated the  detention of captives: few of the male natives could swim; few  understood the structure of a catamaran. The means of escape were not  easily obtained, and for a time the novelty and repose of their bondage  mitigated their dislike to its restrictions: these natural fortresses  kept them in safety, without the aspect of a prison; and one or other  island was accessible from most points of the Tasmanian shore.    Colonel Arthur implied, by his closing proclamation, when he dismissed  the forces, that their labors formed the first series of a connected  plan, only partially developed. The war was, in the estimation of the  Governor and his friends, a preparation for a mission of peace. It was  fortunate that Robinson's early progress imparted to the warlike  expedition the _eclat_ of reflected success. It is not necessary to  scrutinise the notion, or to teach what this history will not  warrant--that measures of conciliation are more successful, when pursued  under the forms of hostility. Had the milder method been tested at an  earlier period, the expenses of the campaign might have been spared.  Colonel Arthur, however, warmly approved, and strenuously supported the  pacific mission: not only was he convinced that nothing further could be  expected from arms, but he felt a real compassion for the unfortunate  race. In this course, he found considerable opposition. \"_We strongly  raise_ our voice,\" one editor remarks, \"against _their civilisation_.  The natives are not to be trusted; and the lives of all engaged in the  mistaken policy of conciliation, are never safe for one moment.\"    The conduct of this mission, the Governor entrusted to the Aborigines'  Committee, originally consisting of Archdeacon Broughton, Rev. Messrs.  Bedford and Norman; P. A. Mulgrave, J. Thomas, S. Hill, and Charles  Arthur, Esquires. Their authenticated statements are embodied in these  pages: their sentiments accorded with their character, but were slightly  tinged by the feelings of the day.    To devise the means of capture, and superintend their application, was  their most important function. It was proposed by one gentleman,  exasperated by injuries, or perhaps unconscious of the details of his  plan, to pursue the natives with bloodhounds. Another suggested the  employment of a man, \"who would soon put an end to the eastern mob; and  who had already killed half that tribe, by creeping upon them and firing  among them.\" He thought that \"the worst men were the best to engage\" in  this work. Another proposed to employ the sealers--men who had waged a  war of extermination with great success. It is but just to observe, that  proposals like these, though received, were not favored by the Governor.  They are in the records of Office, connected with the names of their  authors, and they admit no other excuse than a reference to recent acts  of aboriginal violence, which had shaken the common principles of  British humanity.    The Governor had already announced the re-capture of the natives who  escaped from Mr. Batman's, while he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#16)"],[1,"looked with reverence upon his Vedas, and often claimed them as divine  authority for their doctrines; and though each of them asserted that  its particular god, Siva or Vishnu, was the Supreme Being, and  ultimately the only being, both of them allowed Brahma to retain his  old office of creator, it being of course understood that he held it  as a subordinate of the Supreme, Siva or Vishnu as the case might be.  Meanwhile, at any rate between the third and the sixth centuries,  there existed a small fraternity who regarded Brahma as the Supreme,  and therefore as identical with the abstract Brahma; but although they  have left a record of their doctrines in the Markandeya-purana and the  Padma-purana, they have had little influence on Indian religion in  general.    [Footnote 34: Those are at Pushkar in Rajputana, Dudahi in  Bundelkhand, Khed Brahma in Idar State, and Kodakkal in Malabar.]    A love of system--unfortunately not always effectual--is a notable  feature of the Hindu mind in dealing with most subjects, from grammar  to _Ars Amoris_; and this instinct inspired some unknown theologian  with the idea of harmonising the three gods into a unity by  representing in one compound form or _Trimurti_ Brahma as creator,  Vishnu as the sustaining power in the universe, and Siva as the force  of dissolution which periodically brings the cosmos to an end and  necessitates in due course new cycles of being.[35] This ingenious  plan has the advantage that it is without prejudice to the religion of  any of the gods concerned, for all the three members of this trinity  are subordinate to the Supreme Being, or Param Brahma, whom the  Vaishnavas identify with Vishnu in his highest phase, Para-Vasudeva,  and distinguish from his lower phase, the Vishnu of this compound,  while the Saivas draw a corresponding distinction between Parama-Siva,  the god in his transcendent nature, and the Siva who figures in the  Trimurti. So the most orthodox Vaishnava and the most bigoted Saiva  can adore this three-headed image of the Trimurti side by side with  easy consciences.    [Footnote 35: This idea in germ is already suggested in Maitr. Upan.,  IV. 5 f., and V. 2.]    This idea of the three gods in one, though it is embodied in some  important works of sculpture such as the famous Trimurti in the Caves  of Elephanta, has not had much practical effect upon Hindu religion.  But it has given birth to at any rate one interesting little sect, the  worshippers of Dattatreya, who are to be found mainly in the Maratha  country. The legend of the saint Dattatreya, which is already found in  the Mahabharata and Puranas and is repeated with some modifications  and amplifications in modern works of the sect,[36] relates that when  the holy Rishi Atri subjected himself to terrific austerities in order  to obtain worthy progeny, the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva visited  him and promised him the desired boon; accordingly his wife Anasuya  gave birth to three sons, of whom the first was the Moon, an  incarnation of Brahma, the second Dattatreya, an incarnation of  Vishnu, and the third the holy but irascible saint Durvasas,  representing Siva. Dattatreya dwelt in a hermitage in the Dekkan: he  indulged in marriage and wine-drinking, which however were not  detrimental to his miraculous sanctity and wisdom, and he became  famous as a benefactor to humanity. He is said to have lived in the  time of Kartavirya Arjuna, the Haihaya king, and to have counselled  the latter to remain on his throne when he wished to resign it. In  older works of plastic art he is sometimes represented by the simple  expedient of placing the three gods side by side, sometimes by  figuring him as Vishnu in the guise of a Yogi with some of the  attributes of the other two; but in modern times he usually appears as  a single figure with three heads, one for each of the great gods, and  four or six arms bearing their several attributes (usually the rosary  and water-pot of Brahma, the conch and discus of Vishnu, and the  trident and drum of Siva), while he is accompanied by four dogs of  different colours, supposed to represent the four Vedas, and a  bull.[37] Observe that in all these types Dattatreya is conceived as  an embodiment of the three gods, which is comparatively a later idea,  for in the oldest version of the legend he was simply an incarnation  of Vishnu; but as Vishnu was regarded not only as a member of the  Trinity but also the Supreme Being over and above it, Dattatreya as  his representative has come to include in his personality the nature  of all the trio. There is, moreover, something curious in his  character. His love of wine and woman is a singular trait, and is  quite incompatible with the nature of an ideal saint. It smells of  reality, and strongly suggests that he was not a figment of the  religious imagination but an actual man; and this is supported by the  tradition of his association with Kartavirya Arjuna, who, in spite of  all the mythical tales that are related of him, really seems to have  been a king of flesh and blood. Thus we may venture to see in him yet  another example of the metamorphosis so common in India from a saint  to an incarnation of the god worshipped by him.    [Footnote 36: See Vasudevananda Sarasvati's _Datta-purana_ and Ganesa  Narayana Karve's _Dattatreya-sarvasva_.]    [Footnote 37: On these figures see Gopinatha Rau, _Elements of Hindu  Iconography_, i. p. 252 ff. The dogs seem to be connected with the  Vedic Sarama, on whom see Charpentier, _Die Suparnasage_, p. 91.]      V. TWO MODERN INSTANCES    In Northern India, and especially in Bengal, you will often find  Hindus worshipping a god whom they call Satya-narayana and believe to  be an embodiment of Vishnu himself. The observance of this ritual is  believed to bring wealth and all kinds of good fortune; a Sanskrit  sacred legend in illustration of this belief has been created, and you  may buy badly lithographed copies of it in most of the bazaars if you  like, besides which you will find elegant accounts of the god's career  on earth written by quite a number of distinguished Bengali poets of  the last three centuries. But curiously enough this \"god,\" though  quite real, was not a Hindu at all; he was a Bengali Moslem, a fakir,  and the Muhammadans of Bengal, among whom he is known as Satya Pir,  have their own versions of his career, which seem to be much nearer  the truth than those of the Hindus. In their stories he figures simply  as a saint, who busied himself in performing miracles for the benefit  of pious Moslems in distress; and as one legend says that he was the  son of a daughter of [H.]usain Shah, the Emperor of Gaur, and another  brings him into contact with Man Singh, it is evident that tradition  ascribed him to the sixteenth century, which is probably quite near  enough to the truth.[38]    [Footnote 38: See Dineshchandra Sen, _Folk-literature of Bengal_, p.  99 ff.]    The next instance belongs to the twentieth century. A few years ago  there died in the village of Eral, in Tinnevelly District, a local  gentleman of the Shanar caste named Arunachala Nadar. There was  nothing remarkable about his career: he had lived a highly respectable  life, scrupulously fulfilled his religious duties, and served with  credit as chairman of the municipal board in his native village. If he  had done something prodigiously wicked, one might have expected him to  become a local god at once, in accordance with Dravidian precedent;  but he being what he was, his post-mortem career is rather curious.  For a legend gradually arose that his kindly spirit haunted a certain  place, and little by little it has grown until now there is a regular  worship of him in Eral, and pilgrims travel thither to receive his  blessings, stimulated by a lively literary propaganda. He is  worshipped under the name of \"The Chairman God,\" in affectionate  memory of his municipal career, and as Jagadisa, or \"Lord of the  Universe,\" a phase of the god Siva.          CONCLUSION      Can we trace any uniform principle running through the bewildering  variety of changes that we have observed?    Consider the changes through which Vishnu has passed. At the beginning  a spirit of vaguely defined personality, he appears successively as a  saviour-god, as the mystic saint Narayana, as the epic warriors  Krishna and Rama, as a wanton blue-skinned herd-boy fluting and  dancing amidst a crowd of wildly amorous women, and as the noble ideal  of God preached by the great Maratha and Ramanandi votaries, not to  mention the many other incarnations that have delighted the Hindu  imagination. What does all this mean? It means that the history of a  god is mainly moulded by two great factors, the growth of the people's  spiritual experience and the character of its religious teachers. As  the stream of history rolls on, it fills men's souls with deeper and  wider understanding of life. Old conceptions are pondered upon,  explored, tested, sometimes rejected, sometimes accepted with a new  and profounder content, and thus enlarged they are applied to the old  ideals of godhead. When Indian society had organised itself out of  tribal chaos and settled down under an established monarchical  government, it made Indra the king of the gods, ruling with the same  forms and under the same conditions as a human sovereign. When men of  finer cast realised that the kingdom of the spirit is higher than  earthly royalty, they turned away from Indra and set their souls upon  greater conceptions, ideals of vaster spiritual forces, mystic  infinitudes. Attracted thus to worships such as those of Siva and  Vishnu, they filled them with their own visions and imparted to these  gods the ideals of their own strivings, making them into Yogisvaras,  Supreme Mystics. And so the sequence of change has gone on through the  generations. Most potently it has been effected by the characters of  the preachers and teachers"]]]
