The  female presently selected a fine strip of cedar bark, and started off  with it, sounding a call to her handsome husband, who at once followed  in her wake. I thought, What a brute, to leave his wife to build the  house! But he, plainly enough, felt that in escorting her back and forth  he was doing all that ought to be expected of any well-bred,  scarlet-coated tanager. And the lady herself, if one might infer  anything from her tone and demeanor, was of the same opinion. I mention  this trifling occurrence, not to put any slight upon _Pyranga rubra_  (who am I, that I should accuse so gentle and well dressed a bird of bad  manners?), but merely as an example of the way in which feathered  politeness varies. In fact, it seems not unlikely that the male tanager  may abstain on principle from taking any active part in constructing the  nest, lest his fiery color should betray its whereabouts. As for his  kindness and loyalty, I only wish I could feel as sure of one half the  human husbands whom I meet.    It would be very ungallant of me, however, to leave my readers to  understand that the female bird is always so unsympathetic as most of  the descriptions thus far given would appear to indicate. In my memory  are several scenes, any one of which, if I could put it on paper as I  saw it, would suffice to correct such an erroneous impression. In one of  these the parties were a pair of chipping sparrows. Never was man so  churlish that his heart would not have been touched with the vision of  their gentle but rapturous delight. As they chased each other gayly from  branch to branch and from tree to tree, they flew with that delicate,  affected movement of the wings which birds are accustomed to use at such  times, and which, perhaps, bears the same relation to their ordinary  flight that dancing does to the every-day walk of men and women. The two  seemed equally enchanted, and both sang. Little they knew of the  \"struggle for existence\" and the \"survival of the fittest.\" Adam and  Eve, in Paradise, were never more happy.    A few weeks later, taking an evening walk, I was stopped by the sight of  a pair of cedar-birds on a stone wall. They had chosen a convenient flat  stone, and were hopping about upon it, pausing every moment or two to  put their little bills together. What a loving ecstasy possessed them!  Sometimes one, sometimes the other, sounded a faint lisping note, and  motioned for another kiss. But there is no setting forth the ineffable  grace and sweetness of their chaste behavior. I looked and looked, till  a passing carriage frightened them away. They were only common  cedar-birds; if I were to see them again I should not know them; but if  my pen were equal to my wish, they should be made immortal.

[15] The shrike lays up grasshoppers and sparrows, and the California  woodpecker hoards great numbers of acorns, but it is still in dispute, I  believe, whether thrift is the motive with either of them. Considering  what has often been done in similar cases, we may think it surprising  that the Scripture text above quoted (together with its exegetical  parallel, Matthew vi. 26) has never been brought into court to settle  the controversy; but to the best of my knowledge it never has been.

Probably in the excitement of the moment this fellow forgot  himself.

As I was crossing Boston Common, some years ago, my attention was caught  by the unusual behavior of a robin, who was standing on the lawn,  absolutely motionless, and every few seconds making a faint hissing  noise. So much engaged was he that, even when a dog ran near him, he  only started slightly, and on the instant resumed his statue-like  attitude. Wondering what this could mean, and not knowing how else to  satisfy my curiosity, I bethought myself of a man whose letters about  birds I had now and then noticed in the daily press. So, looking up his  name in the City Directory, and finding that he lived at such a number,  Beacon Street, I wrote him a note of inquiry. He must have been amused  as he read it; for I remember giving him the title of \"Esquire,\" and  speaking of his communications to the newspapers as the ground of my  application to him. \"Such is fame!\" he likely enough said to himself.  \"Here is a man with eyes in his head, a man, moreover, who has probably  been at school in his time,--for most of his words are spelled  correctly,--and yet he knows my name only as he has seen it signed once  in a while to a few lines in a newspaper.\" Thoughts like these, however,  did not prevent his replying to the note (my \"valued favor\") with all  politeness, although he confessed himself unable to answer my question;  and by the time I had occasion to trouble him again I had learned that  he was to be addressed as Doctor, and, furthermore, was an ornithologist  of world-wide reputation, being, in fact, one of the three joint-authors  of the most important work so far issued on the birds of North America.    Certainly I was and am grateful to him (he is now dead) for his generous  treatment of my ignorance; but even warmer is my feeling toward that  city thrush, who, all unconscious of what he was doing, started me that  day on a line of study which has been ever since a continual delight.  Most gladly would I do him any kindness in my power; but I have little  doubt that, long ere this, he, too, has gone the way of all the earth.  As to what he was thinking about on that memorable May morning, I am as  much in the dark as ever. But there is no law against a bird's behaving  mysteriously, I suppose. Most of us, I am sure, often do things which  are inexplicable to ourselves, and once in a very great while, perhaps,  it would puzzle even our next-door neighbors to render a complete  account of our motives.    Whatever the robin meant, however, and no doubt there was some good  reason for his conduct, he had given my curiosity the needed jog. Now,  at last, I would do what I had often dreamed of doing,--learn something  about the birds of my own region, and be able to recognize at least the  more common ones when I saw them.    The interest of the study proved to be the greater for my ignorance,  which, to speak within bounds, was nothing short of wonderful; perhaps I  might appropriately use a more fashionable word, and call it phenomenal.  All my life long I had had a kind of passion for being out-of-doors;  and, to tell the truth, I had been so often seen wandering by myself in  out-of-the-way wood-paths, or sitting idly about on stone walls in  lonesome pastures, that some of my Philistine townsmen had most likely  come to look upon me as no better than a vagabond. Yet I was not a  vagabond, for all that. I liked work, perhaps, as well as the generality  of people. But I was unfortunate in this respect: while I enjoyed  in-door work, I hated to be in the house; and, on the other hand, while  I enjoyed being out-of-doors, I hated all manner of out-door  employment. I was not lazy, but I possessed--well, let us call it the  true aboriginal temperament; though I fear that this distinction will be  found too subtile, even for the well-educated, unless, along with their  education, they have a certain sympathetic bias, which, after all, is  the main thing to be depended on in such nice psychological  discriminations.    With all my rovings in wood and field, however, I knew nothing of any  open-air study. Study was a thing of books. At school we were never  taught to look elsewhere for knowledge. Reading and spelling, geography  and grammar, arithmetic and algebra, geometry and trigonometry,--these  were studied, of course, as also were Latin and Greek. But none of our  lessons took us out of the school-room, unless it was astronomy, the  study of which I had nearly forgotten; and that we pursued in the  night-time, when birds and plants were as though they were not. I cannot  recollect that any one of my teachers ever called my attention to a  natural object. It seems incredible, but, so far as my memory serves, I  was never in the habit of observing the return of the birds in the  spring or their departure in the autumn; except, to be sure, that the  semi-annual flight of the ducks and geese was always a pleasant  excitement, more especially because there were several lakes  (invariably spoken of as ponds) in our vicinity, on the borders of  which the village \"gunners\" built pine-branch booths in the season.    But now, as I have said, my ignorance was converted all at once into a  kind of blessing; for no sooner had I begun to read bird books, and  consult a cabinet of mounted specimens, than every turn out-of-doors  became full of all manner of delightful surprises. Could it be that what  I now beheld "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#16)"],[1,"around with Bible in hand,  shaking it in the faces of the opposition, grew so vehement, that one  would really have thought that they held a commission from high heaven  as the possessors of all truth, and that all progress in human affairs  was to be squared by their interpretation of Scripture. At last George  Bradburn, exasperated with their narrowness and bigotry, sprang to the  floor, and stretching himself to his full height, said: \"Prove to me,  gentlemen, that your Bible sanctions the slavery of woman--the  complete subjugation of one-half the race to the other--and I should  feel that the best work I could do for humanity would be to make a  grand bonfire of every Bible in the Universe.\"          CHAPTER IV.    NEW YORK.           The First Woman's Rights Convention, Seneca Falls, July 19-20,       1848--Property Rights of Women secured--Judge Fine, George       Geddes, and Mr. Hadley pushed the Bill through--Danger of       meddling with well-settled conditions of domestic happiness--Mrs.       Barbara Hertell's will--Richard Hunt's tea-table--The eventful       day--James Mott President--Declaration of sentiments--Convention       in Rochester--Clergy again in opposition with Bible arguments.    New York with its metropolis, fine harbors, great lakes and rivers;  its canals and railroads uniting the extremest limits, and controlling  the commerce of the world; with its wise statesmen and wily  politicians, long holding the same relation to the nation at large  that Paris is said to hold to France, has been proudly called by her  sons and daughters the Empire State.    But the most interesting fact in her history, to woman, is that she  was the first State to emancipate wives from the slavery of the old  common law of England, and to secure to them equal property rights.  This occurred in 1848. Various bills and petitions, with reference to  the civil rights of woman, had been under discussion twelve years, and  the final passage of the property bill was due in no small measure to  two facts. 1st. The constitutional convention in 1847, which compelled  the thinking people of the State, and especially the members of the  convention, to the serious consideration of the fundamental principles  of government. As in the revision of a Constitution the State is for  the time being resolved into its original elements in recognizing the  equality of all the people, one would naturally think that a chance  ray of justice might have fallen aslant the wrongs of woman and  brought to the surface some champion in that convention, especially as  some aggravated cases of cruelty in families of wealth and position  had just at that time aroused the attention of influential men to the  whole question. 2d. Among the Dutch aristocracy of the State there was  a vast amount of dissipation; and as married women could hold neither  property nor children under the common law, solid, thrifty Dutch  fathers were daily confronted with the fact that the inheritance of  their daughters, carefully accumulated, would at marriage pass into  the hands of dissipated, impecunious husbands, reducing them and their  children to poverty and dependence. Hence this influential class of  citizens heartily seconded the efforts of reformers, then demanding  equal property rights in the marriage relation. Thus a wise  selfishness on one side, and principle on the other, pushed the  conservatives and radicals into the same channel, and both alike found  anchor in the statute law of 1848. This was the death-blow to the old  Blackstone code for married women in this country, and ever since  legislation has been slowly, but steadily, advancing toward their  complete equality.    Desiring to know who prompted the legislative action on the Property  Bill in 1848, and the names of our champions who carried it  successfully through after twelve years of discussion and petitioning,  a letter of inquiry was addressed to the Hon. George Geddes of the  twenty-second district--at that time Senator--and received the  following reply:                                         FAIRMOUNT, ONONDAGA CO., N. Y.,}                                                  _November 25, 1880_.}         MRS. MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE:         _Dear Madam_:--I was much gratified at the receipt of your letter       of the 22d inst., making inquiries into the history of the law of       1848 in regard to married women holding property independently of       their husbands. That the \"truth of history\" may be made plain, I       have looked over the journals of the Senate and Assembly, and       taken full notes, which I request you to publish, if you put any       part of this letter in print.         I have very distinct recollections of the whole history of this       very radical measure. Judge Fine, of St. Lawrence, was its       originator, and he gave me his reasons for introducing the bill.       He said that he married a lady who had some property of her own,       which he had, all his life, tried to keep distinct from his, that       she might have the benefit of her own, in the event of any       disaster happening to him in pecuniary matters. He had found much       difficulty, growing out of the old laws, in this effort to       protect his wife's interests.         Judge Fine was a stately man, and of general conservative       tendencies, just the one to hold on to the past, but he was a       just man, and did not allow his practice as a lawyer, or his       experience on the bench, to obscure his sense of right. I       followed him, glad of such a leader.         I, too, had special reasons for desiring this change in the law.       I had a young daughter, who, in the then condition of my health,       was quite likely to be left in tender years without a father, and       I very much desired to protect her in the little property I might       be able to leave. I had an elaborate will drawn by my old law       preceptor, Vice-Chancellor Lewis H. Sandford, creating a trust       with all the care and learning he could bring to my aid. But when       the elaborate paper was finished, neither he or I felt satisfied       with it. When the law of 1848 was passed, all I had to do was to       burn this will.         In this connection I wish to say that the Speaker of the       Assembly, Mr. Hadley, gave aid in the passage of this law that       was essential. Very near the end of the session of the       Legislature he assured me that if the bill passed the Senate, he       would see that it passed the House. By examining my notes of the       Assembly's action, you will see that the bill never went to a       committee of the whole in that body, but was sent directly to a       select committee to report complete. It was the power of the       Speaker that in this summary manner overrode the usual       legislative forms. The only reason Mr. Hadley gave me for his       zeal in this matter, was that it was a good bill and ought to       pass.         I believe this law originated with Judge Fine, without any       outside prompting. On the third day of the session he gave notice       of his intention to introduce it, and only one petition was       presented in favor of the bill, and that came from Syracuse, and       was due to the action of my personal friends--I presented it       nearly two months after the bill had been introduced to the       Senate.         The reception of the bill by the Senate showed unlooked-for       support as well as opposition. The measure was so radical, so       extreme, that even its friends had doubts; but the moment any       important amendment was offered, up rose the whole question of       woman's proper place in society, in the family, and everywhere.       We all felt that the laws regulating married women's, as well as       married men's rights, demanded careful revision and adaptation to       our times and to our civilization. But no such revision could be       perfected then, nor has it been since. We meant to strike a hard       blow, and if possible shake the old system of laws to their       foundations, and leave it to other times and wiser councils to       perfect a new system.         We had in the Senate a man of matured years, who had never had a       wife. He was a lawyer well-read in the old books, and versed in       the adjudications which had determined that husband and wife were       but one person, and the husband that person; and he expressed       great fears in regard to meddling with this well-settled       condition of domestic happiness. This champion of the past made       long and very able arguments to show the ruin this law must work,       but he voted for the bill in the final decision.         The bill hung along in Committee of the Whole until March 21st,       when its great opponent being absent, I moved its reference to a       select Committee, with power to report it complete; that is,       matured ready for its passage. So the bill was out of the arena       of debate, and on my motion was ordered to its third reading.         In reply to your inquiries in regard to debates that preceded the       action of 1848, I must say I know of none, and I am quite sure       that in our long discussions no allusion was made to anything of       the kind. Great measures often occupy the thoughts of men and       women, long before they take substantial form and become things       of life, and I shall not dispute any one who says that this       reform had been thought of before 1848. But I do insist the       record shows that Judge Fine is the author of the law which       opened the way to clothe woman with full rights, in regard to       holding, using, and enjoying in every way her own property,       independently of any husband.         I add the following extracts taken from the journals of the       Senate and Assembly of 1848, viz:         Senate journal for 1848, p. 35. January"]]]
