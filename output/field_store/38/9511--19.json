I don't quite know what  excuse he gave. It was scarcely likely to be so crude as the  excuse I guessed at, 'I want to marry a wife, and therefore I  cannot go.' He unbosomed himself to me engagingly when he came  back from Salisbury. He appealed to my compassionate sympathy.    'Just fancy! Forty-five and no real home!' he said, 'And here  I've come on pilgrimage, and found just what I've unconsciously  craved youth and beauty up-to-date, not this date but the date of  my own unforgotten youth 1888 in lavender, so to speak.'    I wished him luck in his wooing of Miss Kent. If Mrs. Kent had  been a widow, I should have thought her much more suitable. He  gave the bridle-reins a shake, and rode away on an old salted  horse he had bought, walking had grown much too slow for him.    He won Joan Kent, and fixed it up with her late-Victorian parents  to their mutual content.    The wedding date is chosen already it is June 20th a day hallowed  enough, having twice been Jubilee Day. I think Vine would have  preferred May 24th as having been Victoria Day. But Joan objected  to her wedding taking place in Our Lady's May month.        DIVINATION        I have a friend who lives some miles away, among fantastic rocks  and crimson-flowered Kaffir trees. I was over at his homestead  one day in Christmas week last year and found that he was absent.  He was sleeping at a trading-station to east, the boys said, and  would not be back for a day or so. But he had left word with them  to give me supper should I come. So I had time to notice a  change.    Three or four very cool and fresh water-colors adorned his walls.  They were pinned up there under a trophy of harness. Under each  oblong of paper was a title in old English characters. One was  named 'Sundown.' another 'Sun-up' these both showed the homestead  not as it was now in mid-summer, but as I remembered it in late  winter or early spring, with some of the trees in full flower.    The other picture showed a charming group of children variously  colored among the rocks. I feasted my eyes on it for quite a long  while, noting its detail, which bewildered me. Surely no such  scene had been witnessed lately in all South Africa. Yet I knew  the rocks of the scene; they were close by, and the children were  painted some of them with familiar-looking faces. The title  underneath was 'Innocents.'    I did not see my friend for a week or so after that, and when I  did I did not think at first to ask about the pictures. However,  he began to tell the story of them himself. He was talking about  men on the road, a class with which he had a large acquaintance,  having lodged many of them. 'I had one here last week,' he said,  'a white man in clean white ducks. He stopped two nights, and  went outside painting most of the days. He gave me three  pictures. He could paint, couldn't he? I couldn't catch his name,  and he said he wasn't sure where he was going to stop next. But  he went up the Rosebery Road, and seemed to know his way about.  He hadn't got a bag, and he traveled very light just a blanket or  so and a loaf of bread and a cup. I shouldn't think he'd come to  much harm, would he?' I shook my head. 'He could paint, couldn't  he?' he said, glancing up at the pictures. I nodded. 'That's a  fancy picture,' I said; 'that of the children a pretty fancy. I  wonder what it means.' My friend Dick meditated. 'I don't see  much wrong in the painting anyhow,' he said.    The picture was indeed a pretty fancy there were children white  and black in it, and lambs and kids. The white children were  mixed up with the black curiously. One little sturdy Mashona  carried a white child in his arms. A white boy with fair hair,  aged nine or ten, carried a Mashona baby in a goat's skin  strapped to his back. The light of dawn was in the picture a cool  summer dawn. Between the rocks and the red-sprayed trees of our  country was, as it were, a lawn, close-bit by much feeding into a  fair copy of an English lawn. I looked hard at the picture.    'Those two Mashonas are like the children that were burnt in a  kraal this way,' I said pointing. 'I tried to dress their burns  but they both died.' Dick looked up as I pointed, but he said  nothing. He eschews dwelling on painful subjects very often, I  notice. 'Don't you think that they are like?' I asked.    'Kaffir children favor one another,' Dick said sagely. He stood  watching the picture on the faded wall in silence. Then we  dropped the subject. But the mystery of it remained for me.    A week or two after, that mystery multiplied. Dick was expecting  visitors, and he asked me over to meet them. The male visitor was  an official I used to know of old; he was to bring his sister  with him this time, and the sister I did not know. She was a  charming person; one who had been in the country a long time ago  and left it, but had come back again now to be married and to  make a home in Rosebery. She had reached the homestead about  mid-day, the same day that I came over in the late afternoon.    After tea and before dinner we walked down to the cattle-kraal,  all four of us. Then, when Dick and her brother were ahead she  began to question me about that water-color on the wall. I told  her what Dick had told me. 'He told me that himself,' she said,  'but I didn't understand.'    'I thought I knew two of the children,' I said, 'but Kaffir  children seem much alike to our English eyes, don't they? They  seemed to me to resemble two quite little children I used to come  and see. They were badly burnt near here.'    She started.    'Did they get better?' she asked. I shook my head. She started  again. 'Listen,' she said. 'Two children to whom I used to be  nursery-governess were murdered in the \"Rebellion\" on a farm  close to this very place. They were staying with their mother's  elder sister. Please do try and tell me this. Why are these  portraits, life-like portraits, of those two children in this  picture?'    I stared at her rather stupidly. Then Dick came to us we, were  close up to the cattle-kraal and called us to come and see his  young stock, and talked to us about them.    'I don't think I'll tell the children's mother,' she said to me.  I was then saying good-night to her in the bright moonlight  outside the homestead door some hours afterwards. 'They live in  the colony now, she and her husband. Telling her might reopen  deep wounds. It wouldn't do any good at all probably, would it?'    'That depends,' I said, 'on the mother's point of view. You're  sure about the likeness?' She gave a sort of sob.    'Trust me for that,' she said. 'I was very fond of them of Claude  and Polly.'    This last dry season, by the ordering of God, that mother came  our way herself. She was on a pilgrimage of her own. Dick sent  over a messenger hot-haste to tell me that a lady was at his  place and had asked for me. She wanted me to spare the morning  to-morrow if I possibly could. She would have me come on an  expedition with her and talk over something that she had in her  mind to do. Couldn't I sleep at Dick's homestead that night?    I could. I came over about nine o'clock I suppose, walking in a  fresh south-easter with a half-moon to light me. Dick was smoking  outside in the yard when I came.    'The lady's tired,' he told me. 'She's turned in already. She's  got a lad with her. He's inside. Come in and have some supper.'    The stranger rose up as I came in, and I greeted him. He was a  tall, fair boy, whose face I seemed to know. He told me that he  had driven his mother down, as I sat over my supper. I glanced up  at the wall curiously before I had finished. The picture was not  there.    'I thought it was better out of the way,' Dick said when his  guest had gone to bed. 'I didn't know how she might take it. It's  the mother of those poor little Scotch children come to see the  place. Wants to put up a gravestone or monument or something,  poor lady!'    Then I knew where I had seen the stranger boy's face. It was the  image of his dead brother's face in the picture, the white  piccaninny that carried the Mashona baby. I whistled softly.    'Who painted that picture?' I said. 'I know all yon told me. But  did that chap ever come down the road again? I never asked you.'    'No,' said Dick, 'I don't know to this day any more about him.'    I sat silent.    'She wants you to go over to the place with her to-morrow,' Dick  said. 'You know the place, don't you? It's only about three miles  away up the old wagon road; you've been there, haven't you?'    'Yes,' I said. 'There's a wooden cross where they're buried or  should be. I had it renewed two years ago. Didn't I ever tell you  about it? Haven't you been there yourself lately?'    'No,' said Dick. 'I don't fancy the place somehow. But I was  asking about it only this afternoon. The boys tell me there are  some trees there still; white men's trees.'    'Yes,' I said, 'yellow peach-stocks and one gumtree you get it  against the skyline looking up from the spruit. The old pole and  daub house dropped to pieces long ago. I do hope that cross is  standing all right still. I blame myself for not having seen  about it this last year or two.'    The cross had fallen down and the place looked generally forlorn  when we reached it next day. I was troubled about my companion.  She was fair and tall and quiet. When she did talk on the way she  talked about commonplace subjects. But when she saw the forsaken  place and the displaced cross the veil fell. She clutched her  son's arm hard, and I left them together. I went off with the  Mashona boy and the mules out of the way. I had no inspiration at  the moment what to say or what to do. I did not come back for  half an hour.    She told me on the drive back that she wanted to provide somewhat  of a memorial. 'It's been left too long,' she said.

And as for his Reasons you may  find divers of them scatter'd up and down his writings; the  considerabl'st of which seem to be these three; The Ultimate Reduction  of mixt Bodies into Insipid Water, the Vicissitude of the supposed  Elements, and the production of perfectly mixt Bodies out of simple  Water. And first he affirmes that the _Sal circulatus Paracelsi_, or  his Liquor _Alkahest_, does adequately resolve Plants, Animals, and  Mineralls into one Liquor or more, according to their several  internall Disparities of Parts (without _Caput Mortuum_, or the  Destruction of their seminal Virtues;) and that the _Alkahest_ being  abstracted from these Liquors in the same weight and Virtue wherewith  it Dissolv'd them, the Liquors may by frequent Cohobations from chalke  or some other idoneous matter, be Totally depriv'd of their seminal  Endowments, and return at last to their first matter, Insipid Water;  some other wayes he proposes here and there, to divest some particular  Bodies of their borrow'd shapes, and make them remigrate to their  first Simplicity. The second Topick whence _Helmont_ drawes his  Arguments, to prove Water to be the Material cause of Mixt Bodies, I  told You was this, that the other suppos'd Elements may be transmuted  into one another. But the Experiments by him here and there produc'd  on this Occasion, are so uneasie to be made and to be judg'd of, that  I shall not insist on them; not to mention, that if they were granted  to be true, his Inference from them is somewhat disputable; and  therefore I shall pass on to tell You, That as, in his First Argument,  our Paradoxical Author endeavours to prove Water the Sole Element of  Mixt Bodies, by their Ultimate Resolution, when by his _Alkahest_, or  some other conquering Agent, the Seeds have been Destroy'd, which  Disguis'd them, or when by time those seeds are Weari'd or Exantlated  or unable to Act their Parts upon the Stage of the Universe any  Longer: So in His Third Argument he Endeavours to evince the same  Conclusion, by the constitution of Bodies which he asserts to be  nothing but Water Subdu'd by Seminal Virtues. Of this he gives here  and there in his Writings several Instances, as to Plants and Animals;  but divers of them being Difficult either to be try'd or to be  Understood, and others of them being not altogether Unobnoxious to  Exceptions, I think you have singl'd out the Principal and less  Questionable Experiment when you lately mention'd that of the Willow  Tree. And having thus, Continues _Eleutherius_, to Answer your  Question, given you a Summary Account of what I am Confident You know  better then I do, I shall be very glad to receive Your Sence of it, if  the giving it me will not too much Divert You from the Prosecution of  your Discourse.    That _If_ (replies _Carneades_) was not needlessly annex'd: for  thorowly to examine such an Hypothesis and such Arguments would  require so many Considerations, and Consequently so much time, that I  should not now have the Liesure [Errata: leasure] to perfect such a  Digression, and much less to finish my Principle [Errata: principal]  Discourse. Yet thus much I shall tell You at present, that you need  not fear my rejecting this Opinion for its Novelty; since, however the  _Helmontians_ may in complement to their Master pretend it to be a new  Discovery, Yet though the Arguments be for the most part his, the  Opinion it self is very Antient: For _Diogenes Laertius_ and divers  other Authors speak of _Thales_, as the first among the _Graecians_  that made disquisitions upon nature. And of this _Thales_, I Remember,  _Tully_[5] informes us, that he taught all things were at first made  of Water. And it seems by _Plutarch_ and _Justin Martyr_, that the  Opinion was Ancienter then he: For they tell us that he us'd to defend  his Tenet by the Testimony of _Homer_. And a Greek Author, (the  _Scholiast_ of _Apollonius_) upon these Words         [Greek: Ex iliou [Transcriber's Note: iluos] eblastese chthon       aute],[6]         _The Earth of Slime was made,_    Affirms (out of _Zeno_) that the _Chaos_, whereof all things were  made, was, according to _Hesiod_, Water; which, settling first, became  Slime, and then condens'd into solid Earth. And the same Opinion about  the Generation of Slime seems to have been entertain'd by _Orpheus_,  out of whom one of the Antients[7] cites this Testimony,         [Greek: Ek tou hydatos ilui katiste.]         _Of Water Slime was made._    [Footnote 5: De Natura Deorum.]    [Footnote 6: Argonaut. 4.]    [Footnote 7: Athenagoras.]    It seems also by what is delivered in _Strabo_[8] out of another  Author, concerning the _Indians_, That they likewise held that all  things had differing Beginnings, but that of which the World was made,  was Water. And the like Opinion has been by some of the Antients  ascrib'd to the _Phoenicians_, from whom _Thales_ himself is  conceiv'd to have borrow'd it; as probably the Greeks did much of  their Theologie, and, as I am apt to think, of their Philosophy too;  since the Devising of the Atomical _Hypothesis_ commonly ascrib'd to  _Lucippus_ and his Disciple _Democritus_, is by Learned Men attributed  to one _Moschus_ a _Phoenician_. And possibly the Opinion is yet  antienter than so; For 'tis known that the _Phoenicians_ borrow'd  most of their Learning from the _Hebrews_. And among those that  acknowledge the Books of _Moses_, many have been inclin'd to think  Water to have been the Primitive and Universal Matter, by perusing the  Beginning of _Genesis_, where the Waters seem to be mention'd as the  Material Cause, not only of Sublunary Compounded Bodies, but of all  those that make up the Universe; whose Component Parts did orderly,  as it were, emerge out of that vast Abysse, by the Operation of the  Spirit of God, who is said to have been moving Himself as hatching  Females do (as the Original [Hebrew: merachephet], _Meracephet_[9] is  said to Import, and as it seems to signifie in one of the two other  places, wherein alone I have met with it in the Hebrew Bible)[10] upon  the Face of the Waters; which being, as may be suppos'd, Divinely  Impregnated with the seeds of all things, were by that productive  Incubation qualify'd to produce them. But you, I presume, Expect that  I should Discourse of this Matter like a Naturalist, not a Philologer.  Wherefore I shall add, to Countenance _Helmont's_ Opinion, That  whereas he gives not, that I remember, any Instance of any Mineral  Body, nor scarce of any Animal, generated of Water, a French Chymist,  _Monsieur de Rochas_, has presented his Readers an Experiment, which  if it were punctually such as he has deliver'd it, is very Notable. He  then, Discoursing of the Generation of things according to certain  Chymical and Metaphorical Notions (which I confess are not to me  Intelligible) sets down, among divers Speculations not pertinent to  our Subject, the following Narrative, which I shall repeat to you the  sence of in English, with as little variation from the Literal sence  of the French words, as my memory will enable me. _Having_ (sayes he)  _discern'd such great Wonders by the Natural Operation of Water, I  would know what may be done with it by Art Imitating Nature. Wherefore  I took Water which I well knew not to be compounded, nor to be mix'd  with any other thing than that Spirit of Life_ (whereof he had spoken  before;) _and with a Heat Artificial, Continual and Proportionate, I  prepar'd and dispos'd it by the above mention'd Graduations of  Coagulation, Congelation, and Fixation, untill it was turn'd into  Earth, which Earth produc'd Animals, Vegetables and Minerals. I tell  not what Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, for that is reserv'd for  another Occasion: but the Animals did Move of themselves, Eat,  &c.--and by the true Anatomie I made of them, I found that they were  compos'd of much Sulphur, little Mercury, and less Salt.--The Minerals  began to grow and encrease by converting into their own Nature one  part of the Earth thereunto dispos'd; they were solid and heavy. And  by this truly Demonstrative Science, namely Chymistry, I found that  they were compos'd of much Salt, little Sulphur, and less Mercury._    [Footnote 8: Universarum rerum primordia diverta esse, faciendi autem  mundi initium aquam. Strabo. Geograp. lib. 15. circa medium.]    [Footnote 9: Deuter. 32. 11.]    [Footnote 10: Jerem. 23. 9.]    But (sayes _Carneades_) I have some Suspitions concerning this strange  Relation, which make me unwilling to Declare an Opinion of it, unless  I were satisfied concerning divers Material Circumstances that our  Author has left unmentioned; though as for the Generation of Living  Creatures, both Vegetable and Sensitive, it needs not seem Incredible,  since we finde that our common water (which indeed is often  Impregnated with Variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments) being  long kept in a quiet place will putrifie and stink, and then perhaps  too produce Moss and little Worms, or other Insects, according to the  nature of the Seeds that were lurking in it. I must likewise desire  you to take Notice, that as _Helmont_ gives us no Instance of the  Production of Minerals out of Water, so the main Argument that he  employ's to prove that they and other Bodies may be resolv'd into  water, is drawn from the Operations of his _Alkahest_, and  consequently cannot be satisfactorily Examin'd by You and Me.    Yet certainly (sayes _Eleutherius_) You cannot but have somewhat  wonder'd as well as I, to observe how great a share of Water goes to  the making up of Divers Bodies, whose Disguises promise nothing neere  so"]]]
