It is suitable to add, in conclusion, that La Fontaine is a crucial  author for disclosing the irreconcilable difference that exists, at  bottom, between the Englishman's and the Frenchman's idea of poetry. No  English-speaker, heir of Shakspeare and Milton, will ever be able to  satisfy a Frenchman with admiration such as he can conscientiously  profess for the poetry of La Fontaine.          VII.    MOLIERE.    1623-1673.      MOLIERE is confessedly the greatest writer of comedy in the world. Greek  Menander might have disputed the palm; but Menander's works have  perished, and his greatness must be guessed. Who knows but we guess him  too great? Moliere's works survive, and his greatness may be measured.    We have stinted our praise. Moliere is not only; the foremost name in a  certain department of literature; he is one of the foremost names in  literature. The names are few on which critics are willing to bestow  this distinction. But critics generally agree in bestowing this  distinction on Moliere.    Moliere's comedy is by no means mere farce. Farces he wrote,  undoubtedly; and some element of farce, perhaps, entered to qualify  nearly every comedy that flowed from his pen. But it is not for his  farce that Moliere is rated one of the few greatest producers of  literature. Moliere's comedy constitutes to Moliere the patent that it  does of high degree in genius, not because it provokes laughter, but  because, amid laughter provoked, it not seldom reveals, as if with  flashes of lightning,--lightning playful, indeed, but lightning that  might have been deadly,--the \"secrets of the nethermost abyss\" of human  nature. Not human manners merely, those of a time, or of a race, but  human attributes, those of all times, and of all races, are the things  with which, in his higher comedies, Moliere deals. Some transient whim  of fashion may in these supply to him the mould of form that he uses,  but it is human nature itself that supplies to Moliere the substance of  his dramatic creations. Now and again, if you read Moliere wisely and  deeply, you find your laughter at comedy fairly frozen in your throat,  by a gelid horror seizing you, to feel that these follies or these  crimes displayed belong to that human nature, one and the same  everywhere and always, of which also you yourself partake. Comedy,  Dante, too, called his poem, which included the \"Inferno.\" And a  Dantesque quality, not of method, but of power, is to be felt in  Moliere.    This character in Moliere the writer, accords with the character of the  man Moliere. It might not have seemed natural to say of Moliere, as was  said of Dante, \"There goes the man that has been in hell.\" But Moliere  was melancholy enough in temper and in mien to have well inspired an  exclamation such as, 'There goes the man that has seen the human heart.'    A poet as well as a dramatist, his own fellow-countrymen, at least, feel  Moliere to be. In Victor Hugo's list of the eight greatest poets of all  time, two are Hebrews (Job and Isaiah), two Greeks (Homer and AEschylus),  one is a Roman (Lucretius), one an Italian (Dante), one an Englishman  (Shakspeare),--seven. The eighth could hardly fail to be a Frenchman,  and that Frenchman is Moliere. Mr. Swinburne might perhaps make the list  nine, but he would certainly include Victor Hugo himself.    Curiously enough, Moliere is not this great writer's real name. It is a  stage name. It was assumed by the bearer when he was about twenty-four  years of age, on occasion of his becoming one in a strolling band of  players,--in 1646 or thereabout. This band, originally composed of  amateurs, developed into a professional dramatic company, which passed  through various transformations, until, from being at first  grandiloquently self-styled, L'Illustre Theatre, it was, twenty years  after, recognized by the national title of Theatre Francais. Moliere's  real name was Jean Baptiste Poquelin.    Young Poquelin's bent, early encouraged by seeing plays and ballets, was  strongly toward the stage. The drama, under the quickening patronage of  Louis XIII.'s lordly minister, Cardinal Richelieu, was a great public  interest of those times in Paris. Moliere's evil star, too, it was  perhaps in part that brought him back to Paris, from Orleans. He admired  a certain actress in the capital. She became the companion--probably not  innocent companion--of his wandering life as actor. A sister of this  actress--a sister young enough to be daughter, instead of  sister--Moliere finally married. She led her jealous husband a wretched  conjugal life. A peculiarly dark tradition of shame, connected with  Moliere's marriage, has lately been to a good degree dispelled. But it  is not possible to redeem this great man's fame to chastity and honor.  He paid heavily, in like misery of his own, for whatever pangs of  jealousy he inflicted. There was sometimes true tragedy for himself  hidden within the comedy that he acted for others. (Moliere, to the very  end of his life, acted in the comedies that he wrote.) When some play of  his represented the torments of jealousy in the heart of a husband, it  was probably not so much acting, as it was real life, that the  spectators saw proceeding on the stage between Moliere and his wife,  confronted with each other in performing the piece.    Despite his faults, Moliere was cast in a noble, generous mould, of  character as well as of genius. Expostulated with for persisting to  appear on the stage when his health was such that he put his life at  stake in so doing, he replied that the men and women of his company  depended for their bread on the play's going through, and appear he  would. He actually died an hour or so after playing the part of the  Imaginary Invalid in his comedy of that name. That piece was the last  work of his pen.    Moliere produced in all some thirty dramatic pieces, from among which we  select a few of the most celebrated for brief description and  illustration.    The \"Bourgeois Gentilhomme\" (\"Shopkeeper turned Gentleman\") partakes of  the nature of the farce quite as much as it does of the comedy. But it  is farce such as only a man of genius could produce. In it Moliere  ridicules the airs and affectations of a rich man vulgarly ambitious to  figure in a social rank too exalted for his birth, his breeding, or his  merit. Jourdain is the name under which Moliere satirizes such a  character. We give a fragment from one of the scenes. M. Jourdain is in  process of fitting himself for that higher position in society to which  he aspires. He will equip himself with the necessary knowledge. To this  end he employs a professor of philosophy to come and give him lessons at  his house:--         M. JOURDAIN. I have the greatest desire in the world to be learned;       and it vexes me more than I can tell, that my father and mother       did not make me learn thoroughly all the sciences when I was young.         PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY. This is a praiseworthy feeling. _Nam sine       doctrina vita est quasi mortis imago._ You understand this, and you       have, no doubt, a knowledge of Latin?         M. JOUR. Yes; but act as if I had none. Explain to me the meaning       of it.         PROF. PHIL. The meaning of it is, that, without science, life is an       image of death.         M. JOUR. That Latin is quite right.         PROF. PHIL. Have you any principles, any rudiments, of science?         M. JOUR. Oh, yes! I can read and write.         PROP. PHIL. With what would you like to begin? Shall I teach you       logic?         M. JOUR. And what may this logic be?         PROF. PHIL. It is that which teaches us the three operations of the       mind.         M. JOUR. What are they--these three operations of the mind?         PROF. PHIL. The first, the second, and the third. The first is to       conceive well by means of universals; the second, to judge well by       means of categories; and the third, to draw a conclusion aright by       means of the figures Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio, Baralipton,       etc.         M. JOUR. Pooh! what repulsive words! This logic does not by any       means suit me. Teach me something more enlivening.         PROF. PHIL. Will you learn moral philosophy?         M. JOUR. Moral philosophy?         PROF. PHIL. Yes.         M. JOUR. What does it say, this moral philosophy?         PROF. PHIL.It treats of happiness, teaches men to moderate their       passions, and--         M. JOUR. No, none of that. I am devilishly hot-tempered, and       morality, or no morality, I like to give full vent to my anger       whenever I have a mind to it.         PROF. PHIL. Would you like to learn physics?         M. JOUR. And what have physics to say for themselves?         PROF. PHIL. Physics are that science which explains the principles       of natural things and the properties of bodies; which discourses of       the nature of the elements, of metals, minerals, stones, plants,       and animals; which teaches us the cause of all the meteors, the       rainbow, the _ignis fatuus,_ comets, lightning, thunder,       thunderbolts, rain, snow, hail, and whirlwinds.         M. JOUR. There is too much hullaballoo in all that, too much riot       and rumpus.         PROF. PHIL. Very good.         M. JOUR. And now I want to intrust you with a great secret. I am in       love with a lady of quality, and I should be glad if you would help       me to write something to her in a short letter which I mean to drop       at her feet.         PROF. PHIL. Very well.         M. JOUR. That will be gallant, will it not?         PROF. PHIL. Undoubtedly. Is it verse you wish to write to her?         M. JOUR. Oh, no! not verse.         PROF. PHIL. You only wish prose?         M. JOUR. No. I wish for neither verse nor prose.         PROF. PHIL. It must be one or the other.         M. JOUR.Why?         PROF. PHIL.

We found when we moved on that we had not more men than we required for  conducting the dray and driving the cattle.  Had we possessed more  experience, half our number would have driven twenty times as many  cattle as we had, and more than that, with ease.    We made good about twelve miles in the day.  At night we had enough to  do to keep our valuable cattle from straying.  We found the simplest  plan was to light a number of fires in a circle, beyond which the  animals were seldom disposed to move.  It, however, required constant  attention to keep up the fires, for as soon as the flames dropped, the  animals seemed no longer disposed to be restrained within the circle.    This occupied most of our party during the night, so that only two or  three at a time could get rest.  We slept very fast when we did sleep,  to make up for lost time--as Mark observed.  Either Dick Nailor or I was  always on the watch, as I did not think it prudent to trust the  convicts, though they had but little temptation to play us any tricks.  They were pretty well aware that they would have no prospect of setting  up for themselves, even if they should run away with our cattle.    We had got within three or four miles of our station, but as we could  not reach it before dark, we camped as usual, hoping that we might get  there the next morning.    Scarcely had we unyoked our oxen than several blacks appeared coming  towards us from a neighbouring bush.  I was not aware at the time of the  dislike oxen have to the natives, and was astonished at the state of  excitement into which the animals were put as the blacks drew near.  We  had the greatest difficulty, indeed, in restraining the animals from  breaking off into the bush.  I accordingly, followed by Dick Nailor,  went forward to meet our visitors, both of us, however, carrying our  guns, for we could not tell what might be their intention.  They stopped  when they saw the cattle snorting and turning about, seemingly as  unwilling to draw near them as the animals were to have their company.  They seemed to be a tribe not accustomed to white men, for they did not  understand a word we spoke, nor could we what they said.  We discovered,  however, that they wanted something--it was tobacco,--we gave them some.  We showed them that we were ready to be on friendly terms.  They then  begged for something to drink--rum, and seemed very much astonished to  find that we had none.  To my belief they had never themselves tasted  any, but had heard of the white man's fire-water from other blacks--his  curse--their destruction.    After a little time they intimated to us, so we understood them, that  there was something they wished to show to us in the bush at a little  distance.  They seemed so well disposed that I did not at the time dream  of treachery.  I told Dick Nailor that I would go forward and see what  they wanted to show us.  Even Dick hesitated.    \"They may mean well, but if they don't they will have us at terrible  advantage all alone in the woods, and they are fearfully ugly fellows to  look at, they must allow,\" he observed, coming up close to me, to  protect me rather than to seek protection for himself.    Still the blacks seemed so eager that we should go, and made so many  signs to us, that I was sure that there was something particular they  wished to show us.  Had I been as well acquainted with them as I  afterwards became I should not have ventured.  Still the greater number  of murders they have committed must be laid to the white man's charge.  They merely retaliated when treated by him with fearful cruelty and  injustice.  The white man set them an example which the savages copied.  True, many of the convicts were reprobates and outcasts.  Not once, but  frequently men have gone forth with fire-arms and shot down the blacks  as if they had been wild beasts.  I speak of days happily gone by.    I called out to Mark to keep in the camp with the men and beasts, and  Dick and I followed the black, I repeat that it was a very unwise thing  to do.    However, on we went.  I told Dick to keep his eyes about him, and his  gun ready for use.    Having camped early, there was still plenty of daylight; indeed, the  blacks themselves will never move at night, from superstitious  feelings,--the dread of meeting evil spirits: of good ones they have no  notion.  There were a good many blacks about, so we signed them to go on  ahead, and that we would follow.  They did so--when suddenly they drew  back, and we saw before us, on the side of an open glade, under a  thick-stemmed tree, a rude hut, and just before it, on the ground, two  men, wretched, haggard creatures.    On drawing nearer we discovered that the forms alone of the men were  there, the spirit had fled.  Not a particle of food was to be found near  them, but there were the ashes of a small fire, and near it two or three  pieces of burnt leather.  They had been endeavouring, when too late, to  satisfy the cravings of hunger with such food.  We had more to discover.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    CONCLUSION.    It was a sad sight, but what we saw when we got closer was of even  sadder significance.  The blacks pointed to one of the bodies which lay  stretched out.  There was a cut on the head, and, as if just fallen from  the right hand of the other man, an axe.  There could be no doubt that  the last act of one of the famished men had been to murder his  companion--for what object it was horrible to think.    But who were these poor wretches?  We were convinced that they were  bush-rangers.  It was even possible that they were the late companions  of Arthur Wells.  He alone, however, could answer that question.  We  made signs to the blacks that we would bury the bodies the following  day, but that we had not time to do so then.  They seemed to understand  us, and apparently contentedly accompanied us from the spot.  Although  convinced that they did not intend us any harm we were watchful as  before.  This was the more necessary as the sun had set, and it would be  difficult to defend ourselves in the dark.    We pushed on, therefore, to the camp as rapidly as we could.  We found  all safe, and collected some articles which we thought would please the  natives.  We presented them.  They went away highly pleased.    We had scarcely sat down to tea round our watch-fire when curious  shrieks and shouts--most unearthly sounds--reached our ears.  They came  from the direction where we had last seen the natives.  Some of the men  declared that the noise must be produced by evil spirits, and were in a  great fright; but Mark, who was too sensible to entertain so foolish a  notion, asserted that it must be made by the natives, and expressed his  wish to go and see what they were about.  He wanted Dick Nailor to go  with him.  Now Dick, though very big, and utterly fearless of human  foes, had not quite made up his mind as to the cause of the strange  sounds.  I, therefore, fully agreeing with Mark, told Dick to take  charge of the camp, and that I would accompany my boy.  Poor Dick was  really unhappy at this; but I, wishing to prove to the men that although  Satan was busy enough in the country, it was not by making strange  sounds in the bush, persisted in my determination.  Mark, laughing  heartily at the fears of our companions, set off with me.    We had not got far when we saw the light of a fire burning in an open  space among the trees, and figures passing in front of it.  For a short  time the fire was hid from us by some thick bushes, but when we had got  round them we both stopped, and I must confess even I drew my breath  somewhat short, for just on the other side of the fire appeared twenty  or more skeletons dancing about in the most fantastic manner.  Suddenly  they would disappear; then again return and frisk about more furiously  than before.  I rubbed my eyes, I thought that I must be in a dream, or  deceived in some way or other.  I asked Mark what he saw.    \"A skeleton dance, and a very curious thing it is too, but it's some  trick of those black fellows,\" he whispered.  \"Jacob was telling me that  they have meetings at night and play all sorts of pranks.  I caught  sight of the figure of a man just now, between us and the fire, and I  could not see through his ribs.  He was no skeleton, at all events.\"    We crept cautiously nearer, and then saw that what looked like the bones  of skeletons were merely white marks painted on the bodies of the  blacks, and that when they turned round these were concealed from us.  Still I must say that their appearance was at first quite sufficient to  startle anybody not prepared to see them.    Not wishing to disturb the natives we retreated quietly to our camp, but  though we described the curious sight none of the men seemed disposed to  go out and look at it.  The natives kept up their revels for a  considerable time, and prevented us from getting much sleep.  They  effectually prevented the cattle, however, from straying in their  direction.  The natives were keeping what is called a Corroboree, and I  do not know that it is a much more barbarous amusement than many of more  civilised people.    We were off by daybreak, and in three hours reached our settlement.  All  had gone well, and I need scarcely say that we were heartily welcomed.  My purchase of cattle was greatly admired, and very valuable stock they  proved.  I had still a good amount of cash left as capital, so that I  could go on for two or more years without having to sell any stock, and  I now hoped that the land would produce enough corn to feed all those  employed on the farm, with some over.  I forgot to say that in the  afternoon Dick Nailor, with Arthur and two other men, set out to bury  the bodies of the white men.  My suspicion was confirmed.  They were  Arthur's"]]]
