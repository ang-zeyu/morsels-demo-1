On the morning of the Tuesday  after our return from City Point, Mrs. Lincoln came to my apartments,  and before she drove away I asked permission to come to the White House  that night and hear Mr. Lincoln speak.    \"Certainly, Lizabeth; if you take any interest in political speeches,  come and listen in welcome.\"    \"Thank you, Mrs. Lincoln. May I trespass further on your kindness by  asking permission to bring a friend with me?\"    \"Yes, bring your friend also. By the way, come in time to dress me  before the speaking commences.\"    \"I will be in time. You may rely upon that. Good morning,\" I added, as  she swept from my room, and, passing out into the street, entered her  carriage and drove away.    About 7 o'clock that evening I entered the White House. As I went  up-stairs I glanced into Mr. Lincoln's room through the half-open door,  and seated by a desk was the President, looking over his notes and  muttering to himself. His face was thoughtful, his manner abstracted,  and I knew, as I paused a moment to watch him, that he was rehearsing  the part that he was to play in the great drama soon to commence.    Proceeding to Mrs. Lincoln's apartment, I worked with busy fingers, and  in a short time her toilette was completed.    Great crowds began to gather in front of the White House, and loud calls  were made for the President. The band stopped playing, and as he  advanced to the centre window over the door to make his address, I  looked out, and never saw such a mass of heads before. It was like a  black, gently swelling sea. The swaying motion of the crowd, in the dim  uncertain light, was like the rising and falling of billows--like the  ebb and flow of the tide upon the stranded shore of the ocean. Close to  the house the faces were plainly discernible, but they faded into mere  ghostly outlines on the outskirts of the assembly; and what added to the  weird, spectral beauty of the scene, was the confused hum of voices that  rose above the sea of forms, sounding like the subdued, sullen roar of  an ocean storm, or the wind soughing through the dark lonely forest. It  was a grand and imposing scene, and when the President, with pale face  and his soul flashing through his eyes, advanced to speak, he looked  more like a demigod than a man crowned with the fleeting days of  mortality.    The moment the President appeared at the window he was greeted with a  storm of applause, and voices re-echoed the cry, \"A light! a light!\"    A lamp was brought, and little Tad at once rushed to his father's side,  exclaiming:    \"Let me hold the light, Papa! let me hold the light!\"    Mrs. Lincoln directed that the wish of her son be gratified, and the  lamp was transferred to his hands. The father and son standing there in  the presence of thousands of free citizens, the one lost in a chain of  eloquent ideas, the other looking up into the speaking face with a  proud, manly look, formed a beautiful and striking tableau.    There were a number of distinguished gentlemen, as well as ladies, in  the room, nearly all of whom remarked the picture.    I stood a short distance from Mr. Lincoln, and as the light from the  lamp fell full upon him, making him stand out boldly in the darkness, a  sudden thought struck me, and I whispered to the friend at my side:    \"What an easy matter would it be to kill the President, as he stands  there! He could be shot down from the crowd, and no one be able to tell  who fired the shot.\"    I do not know what put such an idea into my head, unless it was the  sudden remembrance of the many warnings that Mr. Lincoln had received.    The next day, I made mention to Mrs. Lincoln of the idea that had  impressed me so strangely the night before, and she replied with a sigh:    \"Yes, yes, Mr. Lincoln's life is always exposed. Ah, no one knows what  it is to live in constant dread of some fearful tragedy. The President  has been warned so often, that I tremble for him on every public  occasion. I have a presentiment that he will meet with a sudden and  violent end. I pray God to protect my beloved husband from the hands of  the assassin.\"    Mr. Lincoln was fond of pets. He had two goats that knew the sound of  his voice, and when he called them they would come bounding to his side.  In the warm bright days, he and Tad would sometimes play in the yard  with these goats, for an hour at a time. One Saturday afternoon I went  to the White House to dress Mrs. Lincoln. I had nearly completed my task  when the President came in. It was a bright day, and walking to the  window, he looked down into the yard, smiled, and, turning to me, asked:    \"Madam Elizabeth, you are fond of pets, are you not?\"    \"O yes, sir,\" I answered.    \"Well, come here and look at my two goats. I believe they are the  kindest and best goats in the world. See how they sniff the clear air,  and skip and play in the sunshine. Whew! what a jump,\" he exclaimed as  one of the goats made a lofty spring. \"Madam Elizabeth, did you ever  before see such an active goat?\" Musing a moment, he continued: \"He  feeds on my bounty, and jumps with joy. Do you think we could call him a  bounty-jumper? But I flatter the bounty-jumper. My goat is far above  him. I would rather wear his horns and hairy coat through life, than  demean myself to the level of the man who plunders the national treasury  in the name of patriotism. The man who enlists into the service for a  consideration, and deserts the moment he receives his money but to  repeat the play, is bad enough; but the men who manipulate the grand  machine and who simply make the bounty-jumper their agent in an  outrageous fraud are far worse. They are beneath the worms that crawl in  the dark hidden places of earth.\"    His lips curled with haughty scorn, and a cloud was gathering on his  brow. Only a moment the shadow rested on his face. Just then both goats  looked up at the window and shook their heads as if they would say \"How  d'ye do, old friend?\"    \"See, Madam Elizabeth,\" exclaimed the President in a tone of enthusiasm,  \"my pets recognize me. How earnestly they look! There they go again;  what jolly fun!\" and he laughed outright as the goats bounded swiftly to  the other side of the yard. Just then Mrs. Lincoln called out, \"Come,  Lizabeth; if I get ready to go down this evening I must finish dressing  myself, or you must stop staring at those silly goats.\"    Mrs. Lincoln was not fond of pets, and she could not understand how Mr.  Lincoln could take so much delight in his goats. After Willie's death,  she could not bear the sight of anything he loved, not even a flower.  Costly bouquets were presented to her, but she turned from them with a  shudder, and either placed them in a room where she could not see them,  or threw them out of the window. She gave all of Willie's  toys--everything connected with him--away, as she said she could not  look upon them without thinking of her poor dead boy, and to think of  him, in his white shroud and cold grave, was maddening. I never in my  life saw a more peculiarly constituted woman. Search the world over, and  you will not find her counterpart. After Mr. Lincoln's death, the goats  that he loved so well were given away--I believe to Mrs. Lee, _nee_ Miss  Blair, one of the few ladies with whom Mrs. Lincoln was on intimate  terms in Washington.    During my residence in the Capital I made my home with Mr. and Mrs.  Walker Lewis, people of my own race, and friends in the truest sense of  the word.    The days passed without any incident of particular note disturbing the  current of life. On Friday morning, April 14th--alas! what American does  not remember the day--I saw Mrs. Lincoln but for a moment. She told me  that she was to attend the theatre that night with the President, but I  was not summoned to assist her in making her toilette. Sherman had swept  from the northern border of Georgia through the heart of the Confederacy  down to the sea, striking the death-blow to the rebellion. Grant had  pursued General Lee beyond Richmond, and the army of Virginia, that had  made such stubborn resistance, was crumbling to pieces. Fort Sumter had  fallen;--the stronghold first wrenched from the Union; and which had  braved the fury of Federal guns for so many years, was restored to the  Union; the end of the war was near at hand, and the great pulse of the  loyal North thrilled with joy. The dark war-cloud was fading, and a  white-robed angel seemed to hover in the sky, whispering \"Peace--peace  on earth, good-will toward men!\" Sons, brothers, fathers, friends,  sweethearts were coming home. Soon the white tents would be folded, the  volunteer army be disbanded, and tranquillity again reign. Happy, happy  day!--happy at least to those who fought under the banner of the Union.  There was great rejoicing throughout the North. From the Atlantic to the  Pacific, flags were gayly thrown to the breeze, and at night every city  blazed with its tens of thousand lights. But scarcely had the fireworks  ceased to play, and the lights been taken down from the windows, when  the lightning flashed the most appalling news over the magnetic wires.  \"The President has been murdered!\" spoke the swift-winged messenger, and  the loud huzza died upon the lips. A nation suddenly paused in the midst  of festivity, and stood paralyzed with horror--transfixed with awe.    Oh, memorable day! Oh, memorable night! Never before was joy so  violently contrasted with sorrow.    At 11 o'clock at night I was awakened by an old friend and neighbor,  Miss M. Brown, with the startling intelligence that the entire Cabinet  had been assassinated, and Mr. Lincoln shot, but not mortally wounded.  When I heard the words I felt as if the blood had been frozen in my  veins, and that my lungs must collapse for the want of air. Mr. Lincoln  shot! the Cabinet assassinated! What could it mean?
