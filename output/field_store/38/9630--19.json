The Gaur, from which this skeleton was taken, was killed at Nicecond,  November 8, 1843. There is another fine specimen of the skull and horns  of the Gaur, in the Museum of the Zoological Society, taken from an  animal killed by Lieut. Nelson, on the Neilsburry Hills, Salem district.  This animal measured nineteen hands and half an inch at the shoulder.    Dimensions of the Figure in the British Museum:--                                                                  Ft. In.

Johnson's Sketches, the Gaur is described as a kind of wild  bullock, of prodigious size, residing in the Ramghur district, not well  known to Europeans. Mr. Johnson says: \"I have never obtained a sight of  them, but have often seen the print of their feet, the impression of  one of them covering as large a space as a common china plate. According  to the account I received from a number of persons they are much larger  than the largest of our oxen; light brown colour, with short horns, and  inhabit the thickest covers. They keep together in herds, and a herd of  them is always near the Luggo-hill; they are also in the heavy jungles  between Ramghur and Nagpoor. I saw the skin of one that had been killed  by Rajah Futty Narrain; its exact size I do not recollect, but I well  remember that it astonished me, having never seen the skin of any animal  so large. Some gentlemen at Chittrah have tried all in their power to  procure a calf without success. The Shecarries and villagers are so much  afraid of these animals, that they cannot be prevailed on to go near  them, or to endeavour to catch any of their young. It is a prevailing  opinion in the country, that if they are in the least molested, they  will attack the persons disturbing them, and never quit them until they  are destroyed; and should they get into a tree, they will remain near it  for many days.\"    The word Gau, or Ghoo, as it is sometimes spelled by European writers,  appears to be used both as a generic and specific term, in Persia and  Hindostan; and as it has the same meaning, and nearly the same sound, as  the German word _Kuh_, and the English _Cow_, it is highly probable that  its origin is the same. As the word _ur_, in Hindostan, appears to have  the meaning of _wild_, or _savage,_ the name Gaur, or Gau-ur, literally  signifies the _wild cow._ Should the prefix _aur_, in the German word  _Aurochs_, be merely a form, or different mode of spelling the prefix  _ur,_ then the name _Aurochs_ would be precisely synonymous with the  Hindostanee _Gau-ur_. That _aur_ is, in this instance, merely a  different spelling of the prefix _ur_, would appear to be corroborated  by the circumstance that the term _Urus_ is the latinized form of the  German _Aurochs_.--_From a MS. Note by Mr. W. A. Chatto._    [Illustration: Head of Gaur, from the stuffed Specimen in the British  Museum.]          THE ARNEE, OR ARNA.      [Illustration]    It does not appear, that the Arnee had been noticed by Europeans until  the year 1792, when the following detailed account appeared in a weekly  Miscellany, called '_The Bee_,' conducted by Dr. J. Anderson.    This animal is hitherto unknown among the naturalists of Europe. It is a  native of the higher parts of Hindostan, being scarcely ever found lower  down than the Plains of Plassy, above which they are found in  considerable numbers, and are well known by the natives.    The figure, which is given at the end of this article, is copied from a  curious Indian painting, in the possession of Gilbert Innes, of Stow. It  forms one of a numerous group of figures, represented at a grand Eastern  festival. There are two more of them in the same painting. In this and  both the others, the horns bend inwards in a circular form; and it would  seem, too, that if a transverse section of the horn was made at any  place, that also would be circular. But this is a defect in the  painting, for although all the horns of the Arnee tribe bend in a  circular form, yet if the horn be cut transversely, the section is not  circular, but rather of a triangular shape. The horns of the Arnee rise  in a curve upwards, nearly in the same plane with the forehead, neither  bending forward nor backward. That part of the horn which fronts you  when the animal looks you in the face, is nearly flat, having a ridge  projecting a little forward all along, nearer the outer curvature of the  horn; from that ridge outward it goes backward, not at right angles, but  bending a little outward; and near the back part there is another obtuse  rounded ridge, where it turns inward, so as to join another obtuse,  rounded angle, at the inner curvature of the horn. Along the whole  length, especially toward the base of the horn, there are irregular  transverse dimples, or hollows and rugosities, more nearly resembling  those of a ram, than that of a common ox's horn, but no appearance of  rings, denoting the age of the animal, as in the horns of our cattle.    This description of the horns is taken from a pair of real horns of the  animal, now in the possession of Mr. James Haig, merchant in Leith, that  were sent home to him this year (1792) by his brother, Mr. W. Haig, of  the 'Hawkesbury' East-Indiaman, and of which the following cut  represents a front view. The little figure marked _a_, represents a  section of the horn near its base.    [Illustration: (1).--Horns of young Arnee--Scale of Half an Inch to a  Foot.]    In this young specimen (1) the length of the skull is exactly two feet,  and the distance between the tops of the horns thirty-five inches. In  the following sketch (2) from the Museum of the College of Surgeons, the  length of the skull is likewise two feet, and the distance between the  tips of the horns three feet four inches and a half.    The young animal just referred to, was found in a situation near which  no other animal of this sort had ever before been discovered: it was  killed by the crew of the 'Hawkesbury,' in the river Ganges, about fifty  miles below Calcutta, at the place where the ships usually lie.    The flesh was eaten by the ship's company, by whom it was considered  very good meat. Although conjectured to be only two years old, it  weighed, when cut up, 360 lbs. the quarter, which is 1440 lbs. the  carcase, exclusive of head, legs, hide, and entrails.    [Illustration: (2).--Horns of Arnee.--Scale of Half an Inch to a Foot.]    [Illustration: (3).--Horns of Arnee.--Scale of Half an Inch to a Foot.]    This last sketch (3) is from a pair of horns in the British Museum, of  which the following are the dimensions:--                                                                     Ft.

The horn _a_, from tip to base, along the outer curve         6   6  The horn _b_               ditto            ditto             6   3  Circumference at the base of horn _a_                         1   5          Ditto       ditto of horn _b_                         1   6[A]    The Arnee is by far the largest animal of the Ox tribe yet known. In its  native country _it is said_ to measure usually twelve, sometimes  fourteen, feet from the ground to the highest part of the back! The one  in the vignette, p. 111, comparing it with the man on its back, would  not seem to be quite so tall.    From the appearance of the three Arnees in the painting before  mentioned, it would seem that they are quite docile, and easily tamed;  for they are all standing quietly, with a person on their back, who  guides them by means of a rein, formed of a cord fastened to the gristle  of the nose, in the Eastern manner. The colour of the animal, in all the  three figures, is a pure black, except between the horns, where there is  a small tuft of longish hair of a bright red colour.    From the accounts of more recent travellers, there seem to be two or  three varieties of this animal, which exist, both in a wild and domestic  state, in China as well as India.    According to Major Smith, the gigantic or Taur-elephant Arnee, appears  to be rare; found only single, or in small families, in the upper  eastern provinces and forests at the foot of the Himalaya. A party of  officers of the British Cavalry, stationed in the north of Bengal, went  on a three months' hunting expedition to the eastward, and destroyed in  that time forty-two Tigers, and numerous wild Buffaloes, but only one  Arnee. When the head of this specimen rested perpendicularly on the  ground, it required the out-stretched arms of a man to hold the points  of the horns. These are described as angular, with the broadest side to  the rear; the two others anterior and inferior; they are of a brownish  colour, and wrinkled; standing outwards, and not bent back; straight for  near two thirds of their length, then curving inwards, with the tips  rather back. The face is nearly straight, and the breadth of the  forehead is carried down with little diminution to the foremost grinder.    There is a spirited figure of a long-horned Buffalo in Captain  Williamson's 'Oriental Field Sports,' which Major Smith considers to be  a representation of the great Arnee; and of which Captain Williamson  relates the following anecdote:--    \"The late Dr. Baillie, who was a very keen and capable sportsman, used,  in my idea, to run many very foolish risks among Buffaloes. I often  remonstrated with him on his temerity, but he was so infatuated, that it  was all to no purpose. One morning, as we were riding on the same  elephant to the hunting-ground, to save our horses as much as possible,  we saw a very large Buffalo lying on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],[0,"Austral English (#16)"],[1,"bushmen.    1892.  `The Australasian,' April 9, p. 707, col. 4:    \"But I said, `Dear friend and brother, yonder billy-can is  mine; You may confiscate the washing that is hanging on the  line, You may depredate the larder, take your choice of pot and  pan; But, I pray thee, kind sundowner, spare, oh spare, my  billy-can.'\"    <hw>Bingy</hw> [<i>g</i> soft], <i>n</i>. stomach or belly.
