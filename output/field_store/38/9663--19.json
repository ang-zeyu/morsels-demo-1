He had lived four years, survived a hundred dangers,  and reared twenty healthy families; and his wits were so finely  sharpened that he was recognised by a flourishing colony, which had  gradually increased around his moss-roofed home, as the wisest and most  wide-awake field-vole that ever nibbled a turnip or harvested a seed.    For a moment the vole sat in the mouth of the burrow, with nothing of  himself visible but a blunt little snout twitching as he sniffed the  air, and two beady eyes moving restlessly as he peered into the sky.  Suddenly he leaped out and squatted beside the nearest stone. A robin,  disturbed in his roosting place by another of his kind, flew from the  hedge in furious pursuit of the intruder, and passed within a few inches  of the burrow. The vole, alarmed by the rush of wings, instantly  vanished; but soon, convinced that no cause for fear existed, he again  left his burrow and for several minutes sat motionless by the stone.    He was not, however, idle--a field-vole is never idle save when he  sleeps--but he was puzzled by the different sounds and scents and sights  around him; they had become entangled, and while he watched and listened  his mind was trying to pick out a thread of meaning here and there. What  was the cause of that angry chatter, loud, prolonged, insistent, in the  fir plantation at the bottom of the field? Some unwelcome creature, bent  on mischief--perhaps a weasel or a cat--was wandering through the  undergrowth, and the blackbirds, joined by the finches, the wrens, and  the tits, were endeavouring to drive it from the neighbourhood.  Gradually the noisy birds followed the intruder to the far end of the  slope; then, returning to their roosting places, they squabbled for the  choice of sheltered perches among the ivied boughs. Silence fell on  upland and valley; and the creatures of the night crept forth from bank  and hedgerow, and the thickets of the wood, to play and feed under the  friendly protection of the fast-gathering gloom. But the field-vole  would not venture from his lair beside the stone.    A convenient tunnel, arched with grass-bents, led thither from the  burrow, the post of observation being shaped through frequent use into  an oval \"form.\" The vole, though anxious to begin his search for food,  was not satisfied that the way was clear to the margin of the fir  plantation, for the air was infused with many odours, some so strong and  new that he could easily have followed their lines, but others so faint  and old that their direction and identity were alike uncertain. From the  signs that were fresh the vole learned the story of field-life for the  day. Horses, men, and hounds had hurried by in the early morning, and  with their scent was mingled that of a fleeing fox. Later, the farmer  and his dog had passed along the hedge, a carrion crow had fed on a  scrap of refuse not a yard from the stone, and a covey of partridges had  \"dusted\" in the soft soil before leaving the pasture by a gap beside a  clump of furze. Blackbirds, thrushes, yellow-hammers, and larks had  wandered by in the grass, a wood-pigeon and a squirrel had loitered  among the acorns under the oak, and a hedgehog had led her young through  the briars. Rabbits, too, had left their trails in the clover, and a red  bank-vole had strayed near the boundaries of the field-vole's colony.  Their signs were familiar to the vole from experience; he detected them  and singled them out from the old trails with a sense even truer than  that of the hounds as they galloped past in the morning's chase.    There was one distinct scent, however, that baffled him. At first he  believed it to be that of a weasel, but it lacked the pungent strength  inseparable from the scent of a full-grown \"vear.\"    Gathering courage as the darkness deepened, the field-vole rustled from  his lair, ran quickly down the slope, and crept through a wattled  opening into the wood. He found some fallen hawthorn berries among the  hyacinth leaves that carpeted the ground, and of these he made a hasty  meal, sitting on his haunches, and holding his food in his fore-paws as  he gnawed the firm, succulent flesh about the kernel of the seed. Then,  with a swift patter of tiny feet on the leaf-mould, he ran down to a  rill trickling over a gravelly bed towards the brook, stooped at the  edge of a dark pool in the shadow of a stone, and lapped the cool, clear  water. Thence he made for the edge of the wood, to visit a colony of his  tribe which in spring had migrated from the burrows in the uplands.  Half-way on his journey, he again suddenly crossed the line of the  unknown scent, now mingled with the almost overpowering smell of a  full-grown weasel. The mystery was explained: the strange trail in the  upland meadow had evidently been that of a young \"vear\" passing by the  hedge to join its parent in the wood.    For a moment the vole stood petrified with terror; then he sank to the  earth, and lay as still as the dead leaves beneath him. But there was no  time to be lost; the \"vears\" were returning on their trail. In an agony  of fear the mouse turned back towards his home. He ran slowly, for his  limbs almost refused their office of bearing him from danger. Reaching  the mouth of his burrow with great difficulty, he dropped headlong down  a shallow shaft leading to one of the numerous galleries. Then, lo! his  mood immediately changed; his reasoning powers became strong and clear;  his parental instincts whispered that his family, like himself, was in  peril. Squeaking all the while, he raced down one tunnel, then down  another, turned a sharp corner beneath an archway formed by the roots of  a tree that had long ago been felled; and there, in a dry nest of hay  and straw, he found his mate with her helpless little family of six  blind, semi-transparent sucklings only three days old. He heard on every  side the quick scamper of feet as, alarmed by his cries, the voles  inhabiting the side passages of the burrow scurried hither and thither  in wild efforts to remove their young to some imagined place of safety.    [Illustration: \"SHE WAS HOLDING ONE OF HER OFFSPRING BY THE NECK, IN  PREPARATION FOR FLIGHT.\" (_See_ p. 139).]    His mate, like her neighbours, had already taken alarm. At the moment of  his arrival she was holding one of her offspring by the neck, in  preparation for flight. The next instant an ominous hiss reverberated  along the hollow passages; the mother vole, with her suckling, vanished  in the darkness of the winding gallery; and the weasels descended into  the labyrinth of tunnels hollowed out beneath the moss.    Again an almost overwhelming fear possessed the hunted vole, his limbs  stiffened, his condition seemed helpless. He crawled slowly hither and  thither, now passing some fellow-creature huddled in the corner of a  blind alley; now lifting himself above ground to seek refuge in another  part of the burrow; now pausing to listen to cries of pain which  indicated how thoroughly the \"vears\" were fulfilling their gruesome  work. It seemed that the whole colony of voles was being exterminated.    Bewildered, after an hour of unmitigated dread, he quitted the place of  slaughter, where every nook and corner reeked of blood or of the  weasels' scent, and limped through the grass towards the hedge. In a  hollow among the scattered stones he stayed till terror no longer  benumbed him, and he could summon courage to seek an early meal in the  root-field beyond the pasture. Directly the day began to dawn, he  cautiously returned to his burrow. Though numerous traces of the havoc  of the night remained, he knew, from the staleness of the weasels'  scent, that his foes had departed.    At noon his mate came again to her nest, and searched for her missing  offspring. But the taint of blood on the floor of the chamber told her  only too well that henceforth her mothering care would be needed solely  by the young mouse that she had rescued in her flight. The day passed  uneventfully; the weasels did not repeat their visit. At nightfall the  mother mouse, stealing into the wood, found both her enemies caught in  rabbit-traps set beside the \"runs\" among the hawthorns.    For a while peace reigned in the underground dwellings of the mossy  pasture, and the young field-vole thrived amazingly; from the very  outset fortune favoured him above the rest of his species. After the  wholesale destruction that had taken place, little risk of overcrowding  and its attendant evils remained, and, for the lucky mice surviving the  raid, food was plentiful, even when later, in winter, they were awakened  by some warm, bright day, and hunger, long sustained, had made them  ravenous. Kweek, having no brother or sister to share his birthright,  was fed and trained in a manner that otherwise would have been  impossible, while his parents were particularly strong and healthy.  These circumstances undoubtedly combined to make him what he eventually  became--quick to form an opinion and to act, and able, once he was fully  grown, to meet in fight all rivals for the possession of any sleek young  she-vole he happened to have chosen for his mate.    Soon after his eyes were open, the adult voles of the colony began to  harvest their winter supplies. Seeds of all kinds were stored in  shallow hiding places--under stones, or under fallen branches--or in  certain chambers of the burrow set apart for that especial purpose; and  as each granary was filled its entrance was securely stopped by a mound  of earth thrown up by the busy harvesters.    The first solid food Kweek tasted was the black, glossy seed of a  columbine, which his mother, busily collecting provender, chanced to  drop near him as she hurried to her storehouse. Earlier in the night,  just outside the burrow, he had watched her with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#16)"],[1," be used for the foundation course in  which the pebbles are as large as will pass a 3-1/2-inch circular  screen opening, and for the wearing course, as large as will pass a  2-1/2-inch circular screen opening. If larger pebbles are allowed in  the wearing course, the surface is certain to become rough after a  time. If the gravel is to be placed in a single course as is a very  common practice, then the maximum size should not exceed that which  will pass a 2-1/2-inch circular screen opening.    The Wisconsin Highway Commission has constructed a very large mileage  of excellent gravel roads and the sizes specified for their roads are  as follows:         \"_Bottom Course Gravel_.--Bottom course shall consist of a       mixture of gravel, sand and clay with the proportions and various       sizes as follows:         \"All to pass a two-inch screen and to have at least sixty and not       more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch       screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per       cent of the total coarse aggregate to be retained on a one-inch       screen; at least sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per       cent of the total fine aggregate to be retained on a two       hundred-mesh sieve.\"         \"_Top Course Gravel_.--Top course shall consist of a mixture of       gravel, sand and clay with the proportions of the various sizes       as follows:         \"All to pass a one-inch screen and to have at least fifty and not       more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch       screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per       cent of the total coarse aggregate (material over one-fourth inch       in size) to be retained on a one-half-inch screen; at least       sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per cent of the total       fine aggregate (material under one-fourth inch in size) to be       retained on a two hundred-mesh sieve.\"         \"_Screened Gravel and Sand Mixtures_.--Where it is impossible to       obtain run of bank gravel containing the necessary binder in its       natural state, screened gravel shall be used and the necessary       sand and clay binder added as directed by the engineer. Gravel       and sand shall be delivered on the work separately. Clay binder       shall be obtained from approved pits and added as directed by the       engineer.\"         \"_Run of Bank Gravel_.--When run of bank gravel is permitted       either for one course or two course work, the size shall not       exceed that specified for bottom or top course. If necessary, the       contractor shall pass all the material through a two-inch screen       for the bottom course, and through a one-inch screen for the top       course. When the work consists of only one course, the material       shall be of the sizes as specified for the top course. The       necessary binder shall be contained in the material in its       natural state, excepting that a small percentage of clay binder       may be added as directed by the Engineer.\"    =Wearing Properties.=--A certain amount of grinding action takes place  on the road surface under the direct action of wheels, especially  those with steel tires. Where rubber tired traffic predominates, this  action is much less severe than where steel tired vehicles  predominate, but the tendency exists on all roads. In addition, there  is distortion of the layer of gravel under heavy loads which causes  the pieces of stone in the surface to rub against each other and to  wear away slowly.    The gravel road in the very best condition is slightly uneven but  there is comparatively little jar imparted to vehicles, and,  consequently, little impact on the surface. When somewhat worn, the  impact becomes a factor of some importance and the pounding of  vehicles has a very destructive action on the surface. Soft pebbles  will be reduced to dust in a comparatively short time.    The degree to which any gravel resists the destructive action of  traffic depends upon the varieties of rock represented by the pebbles  in the gravel. If the pebbles are mostly from rocks of good wearing  properties, that quality will be imparted to the road surface. If  mostly from rocks of little durability, the same characteristic will  be imparted to the road surface. A very good general notion of the  probable durability of gravel can therefore be obtained by a careful  visual examination of the material and classification of the rock  varieties represented by the pebbles.    =Utilizing Natural Gravels.=--Gravel road construction is advantageous  only when it can be accomplished at low first cost. This usually  presupposes a local supply of gravel that can be utilized, or at any  rate a supply that need not be shipped a long distance. In the nature  of things, such deposits are likely to be deficient in some of the  desirable characteristics, and may be deficient in most of them. By  various means, the defects in the materials can be partially corrected  while constructing the road.    If the gravel deposit consists of layers of varying composition as  regards size and clay content, the material may be loosened from the  exposed face and allowed to fall to the bottom of the pit thereby  becoming mixed to a sufficient extent to produce a reasonably uniform  product. If deficient in clay, it often proves feasible to add a small  part of the clay over-burden, thereby insuring enough binder.  Sometimes adjoining deposits will consist one of relatively fine  material, the other of relatively coarse. These may be mixed on the  work by first placing the coarse material in a layer about 5 inches  thick and adding the finer material in a similar layer. The two will  mix very rapidly during the operations of spreading and shaping.    When deposits contain pebbles larger than will pass a 3-1/2-inch ring,  these larger stones will prove to be undesirable if placed on the  road, as they are almost sure to work to the surface of the gravel  layer and become a source of annoyance to the users of the road.  Oversize stone can be removed while loading the gravel or while  spreading it, if care is exercised and not too large a proportion is  oversize. It is preferable however to remove the oversize by means of  screens at the pit. Usually on large jobs the oversize is crushed and  mixed with the supply so as to utilize what is really the best part of  the material.    Gravels deficient in bonding material are often encountered in  deposits where there is insufficient overburden to give enough  additional binder or where the overburden is of a material unsuitable  for binder. Such materials may be utilized by adding binder in the  form of clay after the gravel has been placed on the road.    Almost any gravel deposit can be utilized in some way if the material  is of a durable nature, regardless of other characteristics. The  serviceability of a gravel road will depend largely on how nearly the  gravel approaches the ideal, but variations in the manipulations will  do much to overcome deficiencies in materials.    =Thickness of Layer.=--The thickness of the layer of gravel required  depends both upon the type of soil upon which it is placed and the  nature of the traffic to which the road will be subjected. Gravel  surfaces should not ordinarily be constructed on highways carrying  heavy truck traffic, but if gross loads of three or four tons are the  heaviest anticipated, the gravel will be reasonably stable. On such  roads, a layer of well compacted gravel ten inches thick will support  the loads if a well drained earth foundation is provided. If but  little truck traffic is anticipated and loads up to three tons on  steel tires are the average, a layer 8 inches thick will be  sufficient. In dry climates, a layer six inches thick will be  adequate if it can be kept from raveling.    On secondary roads, carrying principally farm-to-market traffic, and  not a great volume of that, the above thicknesses may be reduced about  one-fourth.    The exact thickness needed for any particular road is a matter for  special study on account of the variations in the gravels and in the  supporting power of the soil upon which they are placed.      PLACING GRAVEL    =Preparation of the Road.=--The roadway that is to be surfaced with  gravel is first brought to the desired grade and cross section. It  would be advantageous if this could be done a year before the gravel  is placed so that no settlement of the earth foundation would occur  after the gravel surface is completed. But if that is impractical, the  grading may be done just prior to placing the gravel, providing  appropriate methods are adopted for securing compacted fills.    =Trench Method.=--Two distinct methods of placing the gravel are in  general use, known as the trench method and the surface or feather  edge method respectively. The method to adopt for any particular road  will depend largely on certain conditions that will be explained  later.    In the trench method, a trench of the proper width and depth for  receiving the gravel is excavated in the earth road surface and the  gravel is placed therein.    The trench is formed by plowing a few furrows and scraping out the  loosened earth with a blade grader. The loose material is generally  moved out laterally to build up earth berms or \"shoulders\" alongside  the gravel. Into this trench the gravel is dumped in the proper  quantity to give the required thickness after being compacted.    The greatest care must be exercised in spreading the gravel to  eliminate unevenness where the loads were deposited. An ordinary blade  grader is one of the best and most economical implements to use for  spreading the gravel. When the gravel has been deposited in the trench  for a distance of a thousand feet or more, the spreading is  accomplished by dragging the surface repeatedly with the blade grader,  the work being continued until all waviness disappears."]]]
