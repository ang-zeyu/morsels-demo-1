Those glorious  trees, the very sight of which has so often filled my heart with  joy, how they adorned and refreshed the parsonage yard, with their  wide-extended branches! and how pleasing was our remembrance of the  good old pastor, by whose hands they were planted so many years ago:  The schoolmaster has frequently mentioned his name. He had it from his  grandfather. He must have been a most excellent man; and, under the  shade of those old trees, his memory was ever venerated by me. The  schoolmaster informed us yesterday, with tears in his eyes, that those  trees had been felled. Yes, cut to the ground! I could, in my wrath,  have slain the monster who struck the first stroke. And I must endure  this!--I, who, if I had had two such trees in my own court, and one had  died from old age, should have wept with real affliction. But there is  some comfort left, such a thing is sentiment, the whole village murmurs  at the misfortune; and I hope the vicar's wife will soon find, by the  cessation of the villagers' presents, how much she has wounded the  feelings of the neighborhhood. It was she who did it, the wife of the  present incumbent (our good old man is dead), a tall, sickly creature  who is so far right to disregard the world, as the world totally  disregards her. The silly being affects to be learned, pretends to  examine the canonical books, lends her aid toward the new-fashioned  reformation of Christendom, moral and critical, and shrugs up her  shoulders at the mention of Lavater's enthusiasm. Her health is  destroyed, on account of which she is prevented from having any  enjoyment here below. Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut  trees! I can never pardon it. Hear her reasons. The falling leaves made  the court wet and dirty; the branches obstructed the light; boys threw  stones at the nuts when they were ripe, and the noise affected her  nerves; and disturbed her profound meditations, when she was weighing  the difficulties of Kennicot, Semler, and Michaelis. Finding that all  the parish, particularly the old people, were displeased, I asked \"why  they allowed it?\" \"Ah, sir!\" they replied, \"when the steward orders,  what can we poor peasants do?\" But one thing has happened well. The  steward and the vicar (who, for once, thought to reap some advantage  from the caprices of his wife) intended to divide the trees between  them. The revenue-office, being informed of it, revived an old claim to  the ground where the trees had stood, and sold them to the best bidder.  There they still lie on the ground. If I were the sovereign, I should  know how to deal with them all, vicar, steward, and revenue-office.  Sovereign, did I say? I should, in that case, care little about the  trees that grew in the country.    OCTOBER 10.    Only to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness! And  what grieves me, is, that Albert does not seem so happy as he--hoped to  be--as I should have been--if--I am no friend to these pauses, but here  I cannot express it otherwise; and probably I am explicit enough.    OCTOBER 12.    Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart. To what a world does the  illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds, surrounded by  impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of the moon, we see the  spirits of our ancestors; to hear from the mountain-tops, mid the roar  of torrents, their plaintive sounds issuing from deep caverns, and the  sorrowful lamentations of a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy  tomb of the warrior by whom she was adored. I meet this bard with silver  hair; he wanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers,  and, alas! he finds only their tombs. Then, contemplating the pale moon,  as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea, the memory of  bygone days strikes the mind of the hero, days when approaching danger  invigorated the brave, and the moon shone upon his bark laden with  spoils, and returning in triumph. When I read in his countenance deep  sorrow, when I see his dying glory sink exhausted into the grave, as he  inhales new and heart-thrilling delight from his approaching union with  his beloved, and he casts a look on the cold earth and the tall grass  which is so soon to cover him, and then exclaims, \"The traveller will  come,--he will come who has seen my beauty, and he will ask, 'Where is  the bard, where is the illustrious son of Fingal?' He will walk over my  tomb, and will seek me in vain!\" Then, O my friend, I could instantly,  like a true and noble knight, draw my sword, and deliver my prince from  the long and painful languor of a living death, and dismiss my own soul  to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free!    OCTOBER 19.    Alas! the void the fearful void, which I feel in my bosom! Sometimes  I think, if I could only once but once, press her to my heart, this  dreadful void would be filled.    OCTOBER 26.    Yes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, and every day I become more certain, that  the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence. A  friend of Charlotte's called to see her just now. I withdrew into a  neighbouring apartment, and took up a book; but, finding I could not  read, I sat down to write. I heard them converse in an undertone: they  spoke upon indifferent topics, and retailed the news of the town. One  was going to be married; another was ill, very ill, she had a dry cough,  her face was growing thinner daily, and she had occasional fits. \"N--is  very unwell too,\" said Charlotte. \"His limbs begin to swell already,\"  answered the other; and my lively imagination carried me at once to the  beds of the infirm. There I see them struggling against death, with all  the agonies of pain and horror; and these women, Wilhelm, talk of all  this with as much indifference as one would mention the death of a  stranger. And when I look around the apartment where I now am--when I  see Charlotte's apparel lying before me, and Albert's writings, and all  those articles of furniture which are so familiar to me, even to  the very inkstand which I am using,--when I think what I am to this  family--everything. My friends esteem me; I often contribute to their  happiness, and my heart seems as if it could not beat without them; and  yet---if I were to die, if I were to be summoned from the midst of this  circle, would they feel--or how long would they feel the void which my  loss would make in their existence? How long! Yes, such is the frailty  of man, that even there, where he has the greatest consciousness of his  own being, where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression,  even in the memory, in the heart, of his beloved, there also he must  perish,--vanish,--and that quickly.    OCTOBER 27.    I could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little we  are capable of influencing the feelings of each other. No one can  communicate to me those sensations of love, joy, rapture, and delight  which I do not naturally possess; and, though my heart may glow with the  most lively affection, I cannot make the happiness of one in whom the  same warmth is not inherent.    OCTOBER 27: Evening.    I possess so much, but my love for her absorbs it all. I possess so  much, but without her I have nothing.    OCTOBER 30.    One hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her. Heavens!  what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passing and repassing  before us, and yet not dare to lay hold of it! And laying hold is the  most natural of human instincts. Do not children touch everything they  see? And I!    NOVEMBER 3.    Witness, Heaven, how often I lie down in my bed with a wish, and even a  hope, that I may never awaken again. And in the morning, when I open my  eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical,  I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal  disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable  load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel  it too sadly. I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly,  my own bosom contains the source of all my sorrow, as it previously  contained the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who  once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who, at every step, saw paradise  open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded toward the whole  world? And this heart is now dead, no sentiment can revive it; my eyes  are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft  tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost  the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds  around me,--it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant  hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and  illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence,  whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed  their leaves; when glorious nature displays all her beauties before me,  and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy  from my withered heart, I feel that in such a moment I stand like a  reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved. Oftentimes  do I then bend my knee to the earth, and implore God for the blessing  of tears, as the desponding labourer in some scorching climate prays for  the dews of heaven to moisten his parched corn.    But I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate  entreaties. And oh, those bygone days, whose memory now torments me!  why were they so fortunate? Because I then waited with patience for  the blessings of the Eternal, and received his gifts with the grateful  feelings of a thankful heart.    NOVEMBER 8.    Charlotte has reproved me for my excesses, with so much tenderness and  goodness! I have lately been in the habit of drinking more wine than  heretofore. \"Don't do it,\" she said. \"Think of Charlotte!\" \"Think of  you!\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#16)"],[1," a portion of a rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost  of civilization as opposed to barbarism. We should as a neutral State  remain in contact with all Europe, which would have to guarantee our  existence. The sanctuaries of Christendom would be safeguarded by  assigning to them an extra-territorial status such as is well-known to  the law of nations. We should form a guard of honor about these  sanctuaries, answering for the fulfilment of this duty with our  existence. This guard of honor would be the great symbol of the  solution of the Jewish Question after eighteen centuries of Jewish  suffering.      DEMAND, MEDIUM, TRADE    I said in the last chapter, \"The Jewish Company will organize trade  and commerce in the new country.\" I shall here insert a few remarks on  that point.    A scheme such as mine is gravely imperilled if it is opposed by  \"practical\" people. Now \"practical\" people are as a rule nothing more  than men sunk into the groove of daily routine, unable to emerge from  a narrow circle of antiquated ideas. At the same time, their adverse  opinion carries great weight, and can do considerable harm to a new  project, at any rate until this new thing is sufficiently strong to  throw the \"practical\" people and their mouldy notions to the winds.    In the earliest period of European railway construction some  \"practical\" people were of the opinion that it was foolish to build  certain lines \"because there were not even sufficient passengers to  fill the mail-coaches.\" They did not realize the truth--which now  seems obvious to us--that travellers do not produce railways, but,  conversely, railways produce travellers, the latent demand, of course,  is taken for granted.    The impossibility of comprehending how trade and commerce are to be  created in a new country which has yet to be acquired and cultivated,  may be classed with those doubts of \"practical\" persons concerning the  need of railways. A \"practical\" person would express himself somewhat  in this fashion:    \"Granted that the present situation of the Jews is in many places  unendurable, and aggravated day by day; granted that there exists a  desire to emigrate; granted even that the Jews do emigrate to the new  country; how will they earn their living there, and what will they  earn? What are they to live on when there? The business of many people  cannot be artificially organized in a day.\"    To this I should reply: We have not the slightest intention of  organizing trade artificially, and we should certainly not attempt to  do it in a day. But, though the organization of it may be impossible,  the promotion of it is not. And how is commerce to be encouraged?  Through the medium of a demand. The demand recognized, the medium  created, it will establish itself.    If there is a real earnest demand among Jews for an improvement of  their status; if the medium to be created--the Jewish Company--is  sufficiently powerful, then commerce will extend itself freely in the  new country.          _III. The Jewish Company_    OUTLINES      The Jewish Company is partly modelled on the lines of a great  land-acquisition company. It might be called a Jewish Chartered  Company, though it cannot exercise sovereign power, and has other than  purely colonial tasks.    The Jewish Company will be founded as a joint stock company subject to  English jurisdiction, framed according to English laws, and under the  protection of England. Its principal center will be London. I cannot  tell yet how large the Company's capital should be; I shall leave that  calculation to our numerous financiers. But to avoid ambiguity, I  shall put it at a thousand million marks (about L50,000,000 or  $200,000,000); it may be either more or less than that sum. The form  of subscription, which will be further elucidated, will determine what  fraction of the whole amount must be paid in at once.    The Jewish Company is an organization with a transitional character.  It is strictly a business undertaking, and must be carefully  distinguished from the Society of Jews.    The Jewish Company will first of all convert into cash all vested  interests left by departing Jews. The method adopted will prevent the  occurrences of crises, secure every man's property, and facilitate  that inner migration of Christian citizens which has already been  indicated.      NON-TRANSFERABLE GOODS    The non-transferable goods which come under consideration are  buildings, land, and local business connections. The Jewish Company  will at first take upon itself no more than the necessary negotiations  for effecting the sale of these goods. These Jewish sales will take  place freely and without any serious fall in prices. The Company's  branch establishments in various towns will become the central offices  for the sale of Jewish estates, and will charge only so much  commission on transactions as will ensure their financial stability.    The development of this movement may cause a considerable fall in the  prices of landed property, and may eventually make it impossible to  find a market for it. At this juncture the Company will enter upon  another branch of its functions. It will take over the management of  abandoned estates till such time as it can dispose of them to the  greatest advantage. It will collect house rents, let out land on  lease, and install business managers--these, on account of the  required supervision, being, if possible, tenants also. The Company  will endeavor everywhere to facilitate the acquisition of land by its  tenants, who are Christians. It will, indeed, gradually replace its  own officials in the European branches by Christian substitutes  (lawyers, etc.); and these are not by any means to become servants of  the Jews; they are intended to be free agents to the Christian  population, so that everything may be carried through in equity,  fairness and justice, and without imperilling the internal welfare of  the people.    At the same time the Company will sell estates, or, rather, exchange  them. For a house it will offer a house in the new country; and for  land, land in the new country; everything being, if possible,  transferred to the new soil in the same state as it was in the old.  And this transfer will be a great and recognized source of profit to  the Company. \"Over there\" the houses offered in exchange will be  newer, more beautiful, and more comfortably fitted, and the landed  estates of greater value than those abandoned; but they will cost the  Company comparatively little, because it will have bought the ground  very cheaply.      PURCHASE OF LAND    The land which the Society of Jews will have secured by international  law must, of course, be privately acquired.    Provisions made by individuals for their own settlement do not come  within the province of this general account. But the Company will  require large areas for its own needs and ours, and these it must  secure by centralized purchase. It will negotiate principally for the  acquisition of fiscal domains, with the great object of taking  possession of this land \"over there\" without paying a price too high,  in the same way as it sells here without accepting one too low. A  forcing of prices is not to be considered, because the value of the  land will be created by the Company through its organizing the  settlement in conjunction with the supervising Society of Jews. The  latter will see to it that the enterprise does not become a Panama,  but a Suez.    The Company will sell building sites at reasonable rates to its  officials, and will allow them to mortgage these for the building of  their homes, deducting the amount due from their salaries, or putting  it down to their account as increased emolument. This will, in  addition to the honors they expect, will be additional pay for their  services.    All the immense profits of this speculation in land will go to the  Company, which is bound to receive this indefinite premium in return  for having borne the risk of the undertaking. When the undertaking  involves any risk, the profits must be freely given to those who have  borne it. But under no other circumstances will profits be permitted.  Financial morality consists in the correlation of risk and profit.      BUILDINGS    The Company will thus barter houses and estates. It must be plain to  any one who has observed the rise in the value of land through its  cultivation that the Company will be bound to gain on its landed  property. This can best be seen in the case of enclosed pieces of land  in town and country. Areas not built over increase in value through  surrounding cultivation. The men who carried out the extension of  Paris made a successful speculation in land which was ingenious in its  simplicity; instead of erecting new buildings in the immediate  vicinity of the last houses of the town, they bought up adjacent  pieces of land, and began to build on the outskirts of these. This  inverse order of construction raised the value of building sites with  extraordinary rapidity, and, after having completed the outer ring,  they built in the middle of the town on these highly valuable sites,  instead of continually erecting houses at the extremity.    Will the Company do its own building, or employ independent  architects? It can, and will, do both. It has, as will be shown  shortly, an immense reserve of working power, which will not be  sweated by the Company, but, transported into brighter and happier  conditions of life, will nevertheless not be expensive. Our geologists  will have looked to the provision of building materials when they  selected the sites of the towns.    What is to be the principle of construction?      WORKMEN'S DWELLINGS    The workmen's dwellings (which include the dwellings of all  operatives) will be erected at the Company's own risk and expense.  They will resemble neither those melancholy workmen's barracks of  European towns, not those miserable rows of"]]]
