[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27995"],[0,"The History of London (#16)"],[1," These were the popular Orders. The monks  remained in their Houses alone, separated from the world. The friars  went about among the people. By their vows they were to possess nothing  of their own: they were to sleep where they could: they were to beg  their food and raiment: they were to preach to the people in the streets  and in their houses: they were to bring the rites of the Church to those  who would not enter the doors of the Church. None were to be too poor or  too miserable for them. In their humility they would not be called  fathers but brothers--fratres--friars. In their preaching they used  every way by which they could move the hearts of the people; some  thundered, some wept, some made jokes. They preached in the midst of the  markets, among the sports of the Fair, wherever they could get an  audience together.    The Franciscans, who had Grey Friars House, now the Bluecoat School,  were founded by St. Francis of Assisi in the beginning of the thirteenth  century. They came over to England and appeared in London a few years  later. On account of their austerities and the faithfulness with which  the earlier Franciscans kept their vows and the earnestness of their  preaching they became very popular in this country. Their name--Grey  Friars--denotes the colour of their dress. The old simplicity and  poverty did not last long. It must, however, be acknowledged that wealth  was forced upon them.    The Dominicans were founded by St. Dominic about the year 1215. Sixty  years later they came to London and established themselves in the place  still known by their name--Blackfriars. Their dress was white with a  black cloak. They were never so popular as the Franciscans perhaps  because they insisted more on doctrine, and were associated with the  Inquisition.    The third of the Mendicant Orders was the Carmelite. They were the  Whitefriars, their dress being white with a black hood. Their House was  in Fleet Street. Here was a sanctuary whose privileges were not  abolished till the year 1697.    Other Orders represented in London were the Cluniacs, a branch of  Benedictines--they had the Abbey of St. Saviour in Bermondsey; the Black  Canons, established at St. Bartholomew's: the Canons Regular of St.  Augustin--who had the Southwark Priory of St. Mary Overie: the Knights  Templars; and the Knights of St. John.    As a general rule it is enough to remember that the monks were  Benedictines with their principal branches of Carthusians, Cistercians,  and Cluniacs: that the friars were those named after Augustine, Dominic,  Francis, and Mount Carmel; that the monks remained in their Houses,  practising a life of austerity and prayer--so long as they were faithful  to their vows: and that the friars went about among the people,  preaching and exhorting them.    Of the nunneries some were Benedictine, some Franciscan: that of the  Minorites belonged to the latter Order: that of St. Helen's, to the  former.    The Religious Houses were dissolved at the Reformation. You must  remember that if it had not been for the existence of these Houses, most  of the arts, science, and scholarship of the world would have perished  utterly. The monks kept alive learning of all kinds: they encouraged  painting: they were discoverers and inventors in science: they were the  chief agriculturists and gardeners: they offered an asylum to the poor  and the oppressed. 'The friendship of the poor,' said Bernard, 'makes  us the friends of Kings.' And in an age of unrestrained passions they  showed an example of self-restraint and austerity. The friars did more:  they were poor among the poor: no one was below their care and  affection: they had nothing--they would take nothing--at first: till the  love and gratitude of the people showered gifts upon them and even  against their will, if they still retained any love for poverty, they  became rich.          28. THE LONDON CHURCHES.      Before the Great Fire of London there were 126 churches and parishes in  the City. Most of these were destroyed by the Fire, and many were never  rebuilt at all. Two or even three and four parishes were united in one  church. Of late years there has been a destruction of City churches  almost as disastrous as that of the Fire. Those who have learned from  this book, and elsewhere, to respect the monuments of the past and to  desire their preservation, should do their utmost to prevent the  demolition of these churches, in consideration of their history and  their association with the past.    Looking at a picture of London after the Fire, you will certainly remark  the great number of spires and towers. London, in fact, was then, and  much more so before the Fire, a city of churches. Those which are here  represented and those which now remain are nearly all the work of  Christopher Wren, the architect of St. Paul's. Many of them are very  beautiful internally; many have been decorated and adorned with the most  splendid carved woodwork. About many there cling the memories of dead  men and great men who worshipped here and made gifts to the church and  were buried here.    Let us show, by a few examples, how worthy these City churches are of  preservation and respect.    First, many of them stand on the sites of the most ancient churches in  the history of London. Those about Thames Street, dedicated to St.  Peter, St. Paul (the Cathedral), St. James, probably represent Christian  temples of Roman London. The church of St. Martin's, Ludgate Hill, was  traditionally built by a British prince: that of St. Peter, Cornhill, by  a Roman general. The tradition proves at least the antiquity of the  churches. St. Augustine's preserves the memory of the preacher who  converted the Saxons. St. Olave's and St. Magnus mark the Danish rule:  St. Dunstan's, St. Alphege, St. Ethelburga, St. Swithin, St. Botolph,  commemorate Saxon saints. Why, for instance, are there three churches  all dedicated to St. Botolph just outside City gates? Because this  saint--after whom the Lincolnshire town of Icanhoe changed its name to  Botolph's town, now Boston--was considered the special protector of  travellers. Then the names of churches still commemorate some fact in  history. St. Mary Woolnoth, marks the wool market: St. Osyth's--the name  exists in Sise Lane, was changed into St. Bene't Shere Hog--or  Skin-the-Pig--because the stream called Walbrook which ran close by was  used for the purpose of assisting this operation. St. Austin's was the  chapel of Austin Friars Monastery. St. Andrew's Undershaft tells that  the City May Pole was hung up along its wall. St.  Andrew's-by-the-Wardrobe commemorates the existence of the Palace  formerly called the King's Wardrobe. In St. Michael's Bassishaw survives  the name of an old City family--the Basings. In St. Martin Orgar's--now  destroyed--we have another old City name--Orgar.    Or, again, there are the people who are buried or were baptised in these  churches.    In All Hallows, Bread Street, now pulled down, was baptised the greatest  poet of our country, John Milton. For this cause alone the church should  never have been suffered to fall into decay. It was wickedly and  wantonly destroyed for the sake of the money its site would fetch in the  year 1877. When you visit Bow Church, Cheapside, look for the tablet to  the memory of Milton, now fixed in that church. It belonged to All  Hallows, Bread Street.        Three poets in three distant ages born,      Greece, Italy, and England did adorn:      The first in loftiness of thought surpassed,      The next in majesty--in both the last.      The force of Nature could no further go;      To make a third she joined the other two.    Christ Church, Newgate, stands on part of the site once occupied by the  splendid church of the Grey Friars. Four Queens lie buried here, and an  immense number of princes and great soldiers and nobles.    Very few people, of the thousands who daily walk up and down Fleet  Street, know anything about the statue in the wall of St. Dunstan's  Church. This is the statue of Queen Elizabeth which formerly stood on  the west side of Lud Gate. This gate was taken down in the year 1760,  and some time after the statue was placed here. One of the sights of  London before the old church was pulled down was a clock with the figure  of a savage on each side who struck the hours and the quarters on a bell  with clubs. London has seldom been without some such show. As long ago  as the fifteenth century there was a clock with figures in Fleet Street.  Tyndal the Reformer, and Baxter the famous Nonconformist were preachers  in this church.    St. Mary le Bow, was so called because it was the first church in the  City built on arches--bows--of stone. The church is most intimately  connected with the life and history of the City. Bow Bell rang for the  closing of the shops. If the ringer was late the prentice boys reminded  him pretty plainly.        'Clarke of the Bow Bell with thy yellow lockes:      In thy late ringing, thy head shall have knockes.'    To which the clerk replied:        'Children of Chepe, hold you all stille:      For you shall have Bow Bell ring at your will.'    St. Mary's Woolnoth was for many years the church of the Rev. John  Newton, once the poet Cowper's friend. He began his life in the merchant  service and was for many years engaged in the slave trade.    For these reasons--their antiquity, their history, their  associations--the destruction of the City churches ought to be resisted  with the utmost determination. You who read this page may very possibly  become parishioners of such a church. Learn that, without the consent of  the parishioners, no church can be destroyed. A meeting of parishioners  must be called: they must vote and decide. Do not forget this privilege.  The time may come when your vote and your's alone, may retain for your  posterity a church rich in history and venerable with the traditions of  the past."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#16)"],[1,"to the wayfarers of  the desert,    Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great.

THE STAR [XLVI.]    MECCA.-62 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By the STAR when it setteth,    Your compatriot erreth not, nor is he led astray,    Neither speaketh he from mere impulse.    The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him:    One terrible in power2 taught it him,    Endued with wisdom. With even balance stood he    In the highest part of the horizon:    Then came he nearer and approached,    And was at the distance of two bows, or even closer,-    And he revealed to his servant what he revealed.    His heart falsified not what he saw.    What! will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw?    He had seen him also another time,    Near the Sidrah-tree, which marks the boundary.3    Near which is the garden of repose.    When the Sidrah-tree4 was covered with what covered it,5    His eye turned not aside, nor did it wander:    For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord.    Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza,6    And Manat the third idol besides?7    What? shall ye have male progeny and God female?    This were indeed an unfair partition!    These are mere names: ye and your fathers named them thus: God hath not sent  down any warranty in their regard. A mere conceit and their own impulses do  they follow. Yet hath \"the guidance\" from their Lord come to them.    Shall man have whatever he wisheth?    The future and the present are in the hand of God:    And many as are the Angels in the Heavens, their intercession shall be of no  avail8    Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept.    Verily, it is they who believe not in the life to come, who name the angels  with names of females:    But herein they have no knowledge: they follow a mere conceit; and mere  conceit can never take the place of truth.    Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth only  this present life.    This is the sum of their knowledge. Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who  erreth from his way, and He best knoweth him who hath received guidance.    And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may reward  those who do evil according to their deeds: and those who do good will He  reward with good things.    To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter faults,  verily, thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy. He well knew you when he produced  you out of the earth, and when ye were embryos in your mother's womb. Assert  not then your own purity. He best knoweth who feareth him.    Hast thou considered him who turned his back?    Who giveth little and is covetous?    Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things?    Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses?    And of Abraham faithful to his pledge?    That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another,    And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath made  efforts:    And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light:    That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense,    And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things,    And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep,    And that He causeth to die and maketh alive,    And that He hath created the sexes, male and female,    From the diffused germs of life,9    And that with Him is the second creation,    And that He enricheth and causeth to possess,    And that He is the Lord of Sirius,10    And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites,    And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor,    And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most perverse.    And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown.    So that that which covered them covered them.    Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of doubt?11    He who warneth you is one of the warners of old.    The day that must draw nigh, draweth nigh already: and yet none but God can  reveal its time.    Is it at these sayings that ye marvel?    And that ye laugh and weep not?    And that ye are triflers?    Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship.      _______________________    1 This Sura was revealed at about the time of the first emigration of  Muhammad's followers to Abyssinia, A. 5. The manner in which the Prophet  cancelled the objectionable verses 19, 20, is the strongest proof of his  sincerity (as also is the opening of Sura 1xxx.) at this period. Had he not  done so, nothing would have been easier for him than to have effected a  reconciliation with the powerful party in Mecca, who had recently compelled  his followers to emigrate.    2 The Angel Gabriel, to the meaning of whose name, as the strong one of God,  these words probably allude.    3 That is, Beyond which neither men nor angels can pass (Djelal). The  original word is also rendered, the Lote-Tree of the extremity, or of the  loftiest spot in Paradise, in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the  throne of God. Its leaves are fabled to be as numerous as the members of the  whole human family, and each leaf to bear the name of an individual. This  tree is shaken on the night of the 15th of Ramadan every year a little after  sunset, when the leaves on which are inscribed the names of those who are to  die in the ensuing year fall, either wholly withered, or with more or less  green remaining, according to the months or weeks the person has yet to live.    4 The Sidrah is a prickly plum, which is called Ber in India, the zizyphus  Jujuba of Linnæus. A decoction of the leaves is used in India to wash the  dead, on account of the sacredness of the tree.    5 Hosts of adoring angels, by which the tree was masked.    6 Al-Lat or El-Lat, probably the Alilat of Herodotus (iii. 8) was an idol at  Nakhlah, a place east of the present site of Mecca. Al-Ozza was an idol of  the Kinanah tribe; but its hereditary priests were the Banu Solaym, who were  stationed along the mercantile road to Syria in the neighbourhood of Chaibar.    7 When at the first recital of this Sura, the prophet had reached this verse,  he continued,    These are the exalted females, [or, sublime swans, i.e., mounting nearer and  nearer to God]    And truly their intercession may be expected.    These words, however, which were received by the idolaters with great  exultation, were disowned by Muhammad in the course of a few days as a  Satanic suggestion, and replaced by the text as it now stands. The  probability is that the difficulties of his position led him to attempt a  compromise of which he speedily repented. In the Suras subsequent to this  period the denunciations of idolatry become much sterner and clearer. The  authorities are given by Weil, Sprenger and Muir. See Sura [lxvii.] xvii. 74-  76.    8 Verses 26-33 are probably later than the previous part of the Sura, but  inserted with reference to it. Some (as Omar b. Muhammad and 1tq.) consider  verse 33, or (as Itq.36) verses 34-42, or (as Omar b. Muhammad) the"]]]
