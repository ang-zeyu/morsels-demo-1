The latter applies to  Abraham Ibn Ezra, who might have said with the poet, \"I avoid  long-windedness, and I become obscure.\"  Samuel ben Meir, on the  other hand, grandson and pupil of Rashi, is, at least in his  Talmudic commentaries, so long-winded and prolix that at first  glance one can detect the additions made by him to the  commentaries of his grandfather.  It is related, that once, when  Rashi was ill, Samuel finished the commentary Rashi had begun,  and when Rashi got well he weighed the leaves on which his pupil  had written and said: \"If thou hadst commented on the whole  Talmud after this fashion, thy commentary would have been as  heavy as a chariot.\" The story, which attributes somewhat  uncharitable words to Rashi, yet contains an element of truth,  and emphasizes the eminent quality of his own commentaries.    He rarely goes into very long explanations.  Often he solves a  difficulty by one word, by shooting one flash of light into the  darkness.  The scholar and bibliographer Azulai scarcely  exaggerated when he said that Rashi could express in one letter  that for which others needed whole pages.  A close study of the  Talmudic commentaries shows that he replied in advance and very  briefly to the questions of many a Talmudist.    It is only in considering the difficult passages that he goes to  greater length to note and discuss explanation previously  propounded.  Take for example what he says on the words '<H>al  mut Laben</H>', the superscription of Psalm ix, which are a  <I>crux interpretum.</I> At the same time the reader will observe  how ancient are certain interpretations of modern exegetes.  Rashi begins by refuting those who allege that David wrote this  Psalm on the death of his son Absalom; for in that case  <H>Haben</H> and not <H>Laben<\\H> would have been necessary, and  nothing in the text bears out this explanation.  Others  transposed the letters of <H>Laben</H> to read <H>Nabal,</H> but  there is no reference to Nabal in this Psalm.  Others again, like  the Great Massorah, make a single word of <H>almut<\\H>.  Menahem  and Dunash,[52] each proposes an explanation which seems to be  incorrect.  The <I>Pesikta,</I> in view of verse 6, thinks the  Psalm refers to Amalek and Esau; and this, too, is not  satisfying.  Finally, Rashi gives his own explanation, scarcely  better than the others,- that the Psalm deals with the  rejuvenation and purity of Israel when it will have been redeemed  from the Roman captivity.    When difficult questions are propounded by the Talmud, or arise  out of a consideration of the Talmud, Rashi cites previous  explanations or parallel texts.  But this is exceptional.  As a  rule he finds with marvellous [marvelous sic] nicety and without  circumlocution the exact word, the fitting expression, the necessary  turn.  One or two words suffice for him to sum up an observation,  to anticipate a question, to forestall an unexpressed  objection, to refute a false interpretation, or to throw light  upon the true meaning of word or phrase.  This is expressed in the  saying, \"In Rashi's time a drop of ink was worth a piece of  gold.\" It was not without justification - though, perhaps, the  practice was carried to excess - that for centuries commentaries  were written upon these suggestive words of his under the title  <I>Dikduke Rashi,</I> the \"Niceties of Rashi.\" Even at the  present day his commentaries are minutely studied for the purpose  of finding a meaning for each word.  In fact, because of this  concise, lapidary style, his commentaries called into existence  other commentaries, which set out to interpret his ideas, - and  frequently found ideas that did not belong there.  Though the  authors of these super - commentaries were Rashi's admirers, they  were scarcely his imitators.    In this regard it is of interest to compare the commentary of  Rashi upon the beginning of the treatise <I>Baba Batra</I> with  that of Samuel ben Meir upon the end of the treatise, which Rashi  did not succeed in reaching.  An even more striking comparison may  be made with the commentary of Nissim Gerundi upon the abridgment  of the Talmud by Alfasi, which is printed opposite to that of  Rashi.[53]  Rashi's style is unmistakable, and prolixness in a  commentary attributed to him is proof against the alleged paternity.    By virtue of these qualities, possessed by Rashi in so high a  degree, he is true to the traditions of French literature, which  is distinguished for simplicity and clearness among all  literatures.  Besides, he compares with the French writers of the  middle ages in his disregard of \"style.\"  It is true, he handles  with ease Hebrew and Aramaic, or, rather, the rabbinical idiom,  which is a mixture of the two.  But he is not a writer in the true  sense of the word.  His language is simple and somewhat careless,  and his writing lacks all traces of esthetic quality.           *       *       *       *       *    Since the Bible and the Talmud made appeal to readers of another  time and another language than those in which they were written,  Rashi's first duty was to explain them, then, if necessary,  translate them, now to add clearness to the explanation, now to  do away with it wholly.  These translations, sometimes bearing  upon entire passages, more often upon single words, were called  glosses, Hebrew <I>laazim</I> (better, <I>leazim</I>), the plural  of <I>laaz.</I>  They were French words transcribed into Hebrew  characters, and they formed an integral part of the text.  Rashi  had recourse to them in his teaching when the precise Hebrew  expression was lacking, or when he explained difficult terms,  especially technical terms of arts and crafts.  The use of a  French word saved him a long circumlocution.  Sometimes, the laaz  followed a definition or description, in a striking manner giving  the meaning of the word or expression.    In employing these French laazim, Rashi introduced no innovation.  His predecessors, especially his masters, had already made use of  them, perhaps in imitation of the Christian commentators, who  likewise inserted words of the vernacular in their Latin  explanations.  The Latin - speaking clergy were often forced to  employ the common speech for instructing the people; and in the  eleventh century beginnings were made in the translation of the  Old and New Testament by the rendition of important passages.  But while it perturbed the Church to see the Scriptures spread  too freely before the gaze of the layman, the rabbis never feared  that the ordinary Jew might know his Bible too well, and they  availed themselves of the laazim without scruple.  The frequent  occurrence of the laazim is one of a number of proofs that French  was the current speech of the Jews of France.  Hebrew, like Latin  among the Christian clergy, was merely the language of literature  and of the liturgy.  It is noteworthy that the treatises  containing most laazim bear upon questions affecting the common  acts of daily life - upon the observance of the Sabbath (treatise  <I>Shabbat</I>), upon the dietary laws, (<I>Hullin</I>), and upon  laws concerning the relations of Jews with non-Jews (<I>Abodah  Zarah</I>).  Rashi extended the use of the laazim, developing this  mode of explanation; and the commentaries of his disciples, who  continued his method, are strewn with French words, which were  then inserted in the Hebrew - French glossaries.  Several of  these glossaries are about to be published.  After Rashi's  commentaries became a classic wherever there were Jews, the  laazim were often translated into a foreign language, as into  German or Italian.  The Pseudo - Rashi on Alfasi,[54] following  the manuscripts, sometimes presents a German translation now  with, now without the French word.    Rashi's Biblical and Talmudic commentaries contain 3157 laazim,  of which 967 occur in the Biblical commentaries and 2190 in the  Talmudic, forming in the two commentaries together a vocabulary  of about two thousand different words.  In the Biblical  commentaries, concerned, as a rule, not so much with the  explanation of the meaning of a word as with its grammatical  form, the laazim reproduce the person, tense, or gender of the  Hebrew word; in the Talmudic commentaries, where the difficulty  resides in the very sense of the word, the laazim give a  translation without regard to grammatical form.    At the present time these laazim are of interest to us, not only  as the expression of Rashi's ideas, but also as vehicles of  information concerning the old French.  As early an investigator  as Zunz remarked that if one could restore them to their original  form, they would serve as a lexicon of the French language at the  time of the Crusades.  But even Zunz did not realize the full  value to be extracted from them.  The rare specimens that we  possess of the <I>langue d'oil</I>[55] of the eleventh century  belong to the Norman dialect and to the language of poetry.  Written, as they were, in Champagne, the laazim of Rashi  represent almost the pure French (the language spoken in  Champagne lay between the dialect of the Ile-de-France and that  of Lorraine [56]), and, what is more, they were words in common  use among the people, for they generally designated objects of  daily use.  These laazim, then, constitute a document of the  highest importance for the reconstruction of old French, as much  from a phonetic and morphologic point of view, as from the point  of view of lexicography; for the Hebrew transcription fixes to a  nicety the pronunciation of the word because of the richness of  the Hebrew in vowels and because of the strict observance of the  rules of transcription.  Moreover, in the matter of lexicography  the laazim offer useful material for the history of certain  words, and bring to our knowledge popular words not to be found  in literary and official texts.

A Sparrow of broad fields and plains whose song voices the spirit of  open places. Neither words nor musical notation can describe it  recognizably. It has somewhat the form of the Song Sparrow's song, just  as the two birds resemble each other in form but are unlike in detail.  One must, therefore, first learn to know the bird--an easy matter, since  it is common and can be readily identified by its white outer  tail-feathers--and thereafter you will be the richer for a knowledge of  this rarely appealing bit of bird music.    The nest, as one might suppose, is built on the ground, and the 4-5  whitish spotted eggs are laid early in May.      IPSWICH SPARROW    _Passerculus princeps_              With a general resemblance to the Savannah Sparrow            (Case 5. Fig. 23) but larger, L. 6-1/4, and            decidedly paler.              _Range._ Nests on Sable Island off Nova Scotia;            winters south, along the coast, regularly to New            Jersey; rarely to Georgia.              Cambridge, casual, two instances, Oct.    Few migratory birds have a more restricted breeding range than the  Ipswich Sparrow. Confined to a sandbar island during the summer where it  is never out of sight or sound of the sea, it seeks similar haunts  during the winter when it is rarely found far from the immediate  vicinity of the ocean. In general habits and nesting, it resembles the  Savannah Sparrow, of which indeed, it is doubtless an island  representative.      SAVANNAH SPARROW    _Passerculus sandwichensis savanna. Case 4, Fig. 47; Case 5, Fig. 23_              In general color slightly paler than the Vesper            Sparrow; smaller than that species; no white            tail-feathers; a touch of yellow before the eye            and on the bend of the wing. L. 5-3/4.              _Range._ Nests from Long Island and northern Iowa            to Canada; winters from southern New Jersey and            southern Indiana southward to Mexico.

Minn.,            common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 23.    An abundant Sparrow known only to bird students. It prefers fields to  door-yards; lives much on the ground, and its darting flight, followed  by a sudden dive to cover, and insignificant song all combine to make it  rather difficult of identification. It nests in May, laying 4-5 white,  speckled eggs in a nest on the ground.      GRASSHOPPER SPARROW    _Ammodramus savannarum australis. Case 7, Fig. 16_              A small, short-tailed Sparrow, without streaks on            the underparts and a back pattern which suggests            'feather scales.' L. 5-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern United States, nesting as far            north as southern Minnesota, and southern New            Hampshire; winters from southern Illinois and            North Carolina to the tropics. The Florida            Grasshopper Sparrow (_A. s. floridanus_) a            smaller, darker race, is resident in the Kissimmee            prairies of south central Florida.

Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May            4-Sept. 13. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 25-Sept.            6.    Grasshopper, he is called, because his unmusical little song, _pit-tuck,  zee-e-e-e-e_, sung from a low perch, resembles the sound produced by  that insect. He is a common inhabitant of old fields, where sorrel and  daisies grow, and when flushed at one's feet darts away to drop suddenly  to the ground beyond. The 4-5, white, spotted eggs are laid in a ground  nest in late May or early June.      HENSLOW'S SPARROW    _Passerherbulus henslowi henslowi. Case 7, Fig. 17_              With the general proportions of the Grasshopper            Sparrow, but the underparts distinctly streaked            and the nape olive. L. 5.              _Range._ Nests from southern Missouri and Virginia            to central Minnesota and New Hampshire; winters in            the Southern States.              Washington, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 21.            Ossining, rare T.V., Oct. 5-Oct. 10. Cambridge,            very rare S.R. N. Ohio, S.R., Glen Ellyn, not            common S.R., May 8-Sept. 26. SE. Minn., common            S.R.    Henslow's Sparrow lives in isolated and sometimes widely separated  communities, frequenting wet meadows in summer, but visiting, also, dry  fields in winter. It has the general habits of the Grasshopper Sparrow  and its notes are equally unmusical. The 4-5 grayish white, thickly  speckled eggs are laid in a ground nest the latter half of May.      LECONTE'S SPARROW    _Passerherbulus lecontei. Case 7, Fig. 18_              The underparts are but slightly streaked, the            crown is striped, and the nape reddish brown. L.            5.              _Range._ Nesting in the interior of North America            from our border States, northward and east to            Minnesota; migrates southward and south-eastward,            and winters locally from South Carolina to Florida            and Texas.              Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 4-?; Sept. 8-Oct.            6. SE. Minn, uncommon S.R., May 1-Oct. 17.    This is the third and rarest member of the trio of small, retiring  Sparrows of which the Grasshopper Sparrow is the commonest. It is found  east of the Mississippi only in the winter when it may be associated  with the Grasshopper and Henslow's Sparrows.      SHARP-TAILED SPARROW    _Passerherbulus caudacutus. Case 6, Fig. 47_              A buffy Sparrow with the underparts sharply            streaked with black. L. 5-3/4.              _Range._ Salt marshes of the Atlantic coast; nests            from Virginia to Massachusetts; winters from New            Jersey to Florida.              Cambridge, formerly common S.R., but occurs no            longer.    An abundant inhabitant of salt marshes. There is, or was, a colony on  the Hudson River immediately south of the long pier from which Piermont  takes its name, but with this exception I have never seen this Sparrow  beyond the sound of the surf. It runs about through the thick marsh  grasses taking wing only when hard pressed. Its song is short and  insignificant. It nests on the ground, the 3-4 grayish white, finely  speckled eggs being laid in late May or early June.      NELSON'S SHARP-TAILED SPARROW    _Passerherbulus nelsoni nelsoni_              Resembles the Sharp-tailed but is smaller and has            the throat, breast and sides deeper, very            slightly, if at all, streaked with blackish; the            upperparts more broadly margined with whitish. L.            5-1/2.              _Range._ Nests in the interior from South Dakota            northward to Great Slave Lake; migrates south to            Texas and southeast through New York and            Massachusetts to North Carolina and Florida.              Washington, rare T.V., May-Sept. Ossining,            tolerably common T.V., Sept. 28-Oct. 17.            Cambridge, formerly uncommon T.V. Glen Ellyn, one            record, Oct. 2, 1893. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V.    This is a fresh-water representative of the Sharp-tail which nests in  the prairie sloughs of the interior and reaches the Atlantic coast  during its migrations and in the winter. It resembles the Sharp-tail in  habits and when on the coast, may be found associated with it.    The Acadian Sharp-tailed Sparrow (_P. n. subvirgatus_) is similar to the  Sharp-tailed Sparrow but is paler above; the throat, breast and sides  are washed with cream-buff and indistinctly streaked with ashy. It nests  on the salt marshes of the Atlantic coast from Maine to Cape Breton and  in Prince Edward Island; and winters from South Carolina to Florida. In  general habits it resembles the two preceding.    The three Sharp-tails may be distinguished chiefly by the color and  markings of the breast. In the Sharp-tail these are _pale_ buff  _distinctly_ streaked with blackish. In Nelson's they are _deep_ buff  lightly if at all streaked. In the Acadian they are cream-buff  indistinctly streaked with _grayish_. The Sharp-tail may be known from  the other two by its distinct black marks below, but the other two  cannot certainly be distinguished from each other in life where both may  be expected to occur.      SEASIDE SPARROW    _Passerherbulus maritimus maritimus. Case 6, Fig. 46_              An olive-greenish Sparrow, with a yellow mark            before the eye and on the bend of the wing; the            underparts _not_ distinctly streaked. L. 6.              _Range._ Salt marshes of the Atlantic Coast; nests            from Virginia to Massachusetts; winters from            Virginia to Georgia.    In the Piermont marsh, referred to under the Sharp-tailed Sparrow, there  are Seasides as well as Sharp-tails, but this is the only place in which  I have seen Seasides away from the sea. There they are abundant in the  grassy"]]]
