They judged of everything by the sense of smell.  As they came near they  smelt the boat, then smelt the people, as they did all the articles  offered them.  Although setting little value on the beads, they were  delighted with the hawks' bells, and still more so with anything of  brass.  Taking some of the people as guides, he proceeded west for eight  leagues, to a point which he called the Needle.  So beautiful was the  country, that he gave it the name of The Garden.    Here many natives came off, and invited the Admiral on shore in the name  of their King.  Many wore collars and burnished plates of that inferior  kind of gold, called by the Indians _guanin_, and they pointed to a land  in the west, from whence they said it came; but the cupidity of the  Spaniards was excited by strings of pearls round the arms of some of  them.  These, they said, were procured at the sea-coast on the northern  side of Paria, and they showed the mother-of-pearl shells from which  they were taken.    To secure specimens to be sent to Spain, Columbus dispatched some boats  to that part of the shore.  Numbers of the natives came down, and  treating the Spaniards as beings of a superior order, regaled them with  bread and various fruits of excellent flavour.  They had among them tame  parrots, one of light green with a yellow neck, and the tips of the  wings of a bright red, others of a vivid scarlet, except some azure  feathers in the wing.  These they gave to the Spaniards, who, however,  cared for nothing but pearls, many necklaces and bracelets of which were  given by the Indian women in exchange for hawks' bells or articles of  brass.    The Spaniards returned on board highly delighted at the way they had  been treated, while the quantity of pearls seen among the natives raised  the sanguine anticipations of Columbus, who was anxious to send the  finest specimens to the sovereigns.    Still believing the peninsula of Paria to be an island, he sailed on  westward until compelled, by finding the water more shallow as he  advanced, to anchor, when he sent a caravel to explore.  She returned  the following day with a report that at the end of the gulf there was an  opening of two leagues, which led into an inner gulf, into which flowed  a quantity of fresh water by four openings.  It was in reality the mouth  of the large river now called the Paria.  To the inner gulf Columbus  gave the name of the Gulf of Pearls.    Finding no passage to the westward, the ships proceeded in an opposite  direction for the Boca del Dragon.  On the 13th of August they anchored  in a fine harbour, to which Columbus gave the name of Puerto de Gatos.  Here also were seen mangroves growing in the water with oysters clinging  to the branches, their mouths open, as the Spaniards supposed, to  receive the dew which was afterwards thought to be transformed into  pearls.  That they were thus formed was believed until comparatively  late years.    The passage through which he was about to pass is extremely dangerous  after the rainy season, and the water which rushes through it foams and  roars as if breaking on rocks.  Scarcely had the ships entered than the  wind died away, and shipwreck appeared imminent, but they were at length  carried through by the current of fresh water into the open sea.    Columbus now stood to the westward, running along the northern coast of  Paria, still supposing it to be an island, intending to visit the Gulf  of Pearls.  To the north-east he saw the two islands of Tobago and  Granada, and on the 15th those of Margarita and Cubagua, afterwards  famed for their pearl fishing.    On approaching the latter, a number of Indians were seen fishing for  pearls.  A boat being sent to communicate with them, a seaman offered a  broken piece of gaily-painted porcelain to a woman who had round her  neck a string of pearls, which she readily gave in exchange.    On this the Admiral sent people on shore, who with beads and hawks'  bells soon procured three pounds weight of pearls, some of very large  size.    The coast still trending to the westward, and rising into lofty ranges  of mountains, Columbus began to suspect that he was off the mainland of  India; but his eyesight failing, he was reluctantly compelled to steer  for Hispaniola to seek for needed rest.  On making land, after a sail of  five days, he found that he was fifty leagues to the westward of his  destination, having been driven across by the strong steady current  which sets in from the east, and assists to give an impetus to the Gulf  Stream.    Sending on shore for an Indian messenger to take a letter to his brother  the Adelantado, a canoe came off with several Indians, one of whom  carried a Spanish crossbow.  As this was not an article of traffic, the  Admiral feared that fresh troubles had arisen, and that the weapon had  fallen into the Indian's hands by the death of a Spaniard.    Sailing, he arrived near the mouth of the river on the 30th of August,  when a caravel, appeared, on board of which came the Adelantado.  The  brothers met with mutual joy, but the latter grieved to see the great  navigator so broken down in health, a mere wreck of himself, though with  his spirit still rising superior to all bodily affliction.    Though considerable progress had been made in the building of Isabella,  now called San Domingo, at the mouth of the Ozema, the Adelantado had  sad accounts to give of the state of the island.  Rebellion had been  rife among the colonists in all directions.  The Indians had been  barbarously treated, and all authority had been set at defiance.  Attempts had been made to murder the Adelantado, and the leaders had  sent home the most serious accusations against him and Columbus and  their brother Diego.  They had succeeded too well in raising suspicions  in the mind of Ferdinand as to the loyalty of Columbus, and an officer  of the royal household, Don Francisco de Bobadilla, was sent out  nominally to investigate the causes of the rebellion, but with power to  arrest the persons and sequestrate the effects of those he might  consider guilty; while he was to take upon himself the government of the  island, and to demand the surrender of all fortresses, ships, and other  royal property.    Columbus had gone into the interior to arrange matters, while the  Adelantado and his brother had almost succeeded in overcoming the  rebellion, when Bobadilla, accompanied by a guard of twenty-five men and  six friars, who had charge of a number of Indians sent back to their  country, appeared off Saint Domingo on the 23rd of August, 1500.  Landing, without stopping to investigate the conduct of Columbus and his  brothers, he instantly commenced the most arbitrary proceedings.  He  took up his residence in the house of Columbus, of whose whole property,  gold, plate, jewels, horses, together with his public and even private  letters and manuscripts, he at once possessed himself.    Don Diego was seized, thrown into irons, and confined on board a  caravel.  Columbus was summoned to San Domingo; he came, almost  unattended, when, being at once seized, Bobadilla gave orders that he  should be put in irons, and confined him in the fortress.    When the irons were brought, every one present shrank at the task of  putting them on the limbs of the venerable and illustrious prisoners,  either from a sentiment of compassion at so great a reverse of fortune,  or out of habitual reverence for his person.  A wretched cook named  Espinosa was the only person found to rivet the fetters.  The great  navigator conducted himself with the magnanimity which might have been  expected.  The injustice and ingratitude of the sovereigns alone wounded  his spirit, and he bore all his present misfortunes in silence.    Though the Adelantado was at the head of a strong force when summoned to  San Domingo, he returned unattended, and was treated as his brother had  been.  Columbus had expected to have suffered on the scaffold, and was  greatly relieved when he found himself conducted on board a caravel  commanded by a worthy captain--Alonzo de Villejo--who told him that he  had orders to carry him to Spain.    He and his brother embarked, amidst the scoffs and shouts of a miscreant  rabble, who took a brutal joy in heaping insult on his venerable head.    Villejo, touched by the sufferings of Columbus, treated him with much  respect, and would have relieved him of his shackles, but he answered,  \"No: their Majesties commanded me to submit to whatever Bobadilla might  devise; by their authority he has put upon me these shackles.  I will  wear them until they direct them to be taken off, and I will preserve  them as relics and memorials, as the reward of my services.\"    The page of history presents no sadder picture than Columbus in chains  crossing the ocean from those lands discovered by his genius, boldness,  and perseverance.    The voyage was favourable and of moderate duration.  In a short time the  ship, with her illustrious prisoner on board, arrived at Cadiz.  Columbus a prisoner and in chains produced almost as great a sensation  as his triumphant return from his first voyage.  A reaction took place,  and a strong sympathy was expressed, against which it would have been  odious for the Government to contend.  The ignominious manner in which  Columbus had been treated created murmurs of astonishment at the Court  at Grenada, and a letter written by him on board reached the  noble-minded Isabella before the document sent home by Bobadilla.  She  saw how grossly Columbus had been wronged and the royal authority  abused, and her heart was filled with mingled sympathy and indignation.    The Queen and Ferdinand instantly sent off to Cadiz, directing that the  prisoners should be set at liberty and treated with all distinction; and  they wrote a letter to Columbus, expressing their grief at what he had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#16)"],[1,", fighting at the head of the Persian army, was one of the first  to die; and when the Persians saw their companions falling around them  like ripe grain under the mower's scythe, they were seized with terror,  rushed toward the sea, and embarked in their vessels in great haste.    The Athenians followed the enemy closely, killing all they could reach,  and trying to prevent them from embarking and so escaping their wrath.  One Greek soldier even rushed down into the waves, and held a Persian  vessel which was about to push off.    The Persians, anxious to escape, struck at him, and chopped off his  hand; but the Greek, without hesitating a moment, grasped the boat with  his other hand, and held it fast. In their hurry to get away, the  Persians struck off that hand too; but the dauntless hero caught and  held the boat with his strong teeth, and died beneath the repeated  blows of the enemy without having once let go. Thanks to him, not one of  those enemies escaped.    The victory was a glorious one. The whole Persian force had been routed  by a mere handful of men; and the Athenians were so proud of their  victory, that they longed to have their fellow-citizens rejoice with  them.    One of the soldiers, who had fought bravely all day, and who was covered  with blood, said he would carry the glad news, and, without waiting a  moment, he started off at a run.    Such was his haste to reassure the Athenians, that he ran at his utmost  speed, and reached the city in a few hours. He was so exhausted,  however, that he had barely time to gasp out, \"Rejoice, we have  conquered!\" before he sank down in the middle of the market place, dead.    The Greeks, having no more foes to kill, next began to rob the tents,  where they found so much booty that each man became quite rich. Then  they gathered up their dead, and buried them honorably on the  battlefield, at a spot where they afterward erected ten small columns  bearing the names of all who had lost their lives in the conflict.    Just as all was over, the Spartan force came rushing up, ready to give  their promised aid. They were so sorry not to have had a chance to fight  also, and to have missed a share in the glory, that they vowed they  would never again allow any superstition to prevent their striking a  blow for their native land whenever the necessity arose.    Miltiades, instead of permitting his weary soldiers to camp on the  battlefield, and celebrate their victory by a grand feast, next ordered  them to march on to the city, so as to defend it in case the Persian  fleet came to attack it.    The troops had scarcely arrived in town and taken up their post there,  when the Persian vessels came in; but when the soldiers attempted to  land, and saw the same men ready to meet them, they were so dismayed  that they beat a hasty retreat without striking another blow.          XLV. MILTIADES' DISGRACE.      The victory of Marathon was a great triumph for the Athenians; and  Miltiades, who had so successfully led them, was loaded with honors. His  portrait was painted by the best artist of the day, and it was placed in  one of the porticos of Athens, where every one could see it.    At his request, the main part of the booty was given to the gods, for  the Greeks believed that it was owing to divine favor that they had  conquered their enemies. The brazen arms and shields which they had  taken from the ten thousand Persians killed were therefore melted, and  formed into an immense statue of Athene, which was placed on the  Acropolis, on a pedestal so high that the glittering lance which the  goddess held could be seen far out at sea when the sunbeams struck its  point.    The Athenians vented their triumph and delight in song and dance, in  plays and works of art of all kinds; for they wished to commemorate the  glorious victory which had cost them only a hundred and ninety men,  while the enemy had lost ten thousand.    One of their choicest art treasures was made by Phidias, the greatest  sculptor the world has ever known, out of a beautiful block of marble  which Darius had brought from Persia. The Great King had intended to set  it up in Athens as a monument of his victory over the Greeks. It was  used instead to record his defeat; and when finished, the statue  represented Nem'e-sis, the goddess of retribution, whose place it was to  punish the proud and insolent, and to make them repent of their sins.    Miltiades was, as we have seen, the idol of the Athenian people after  his victory at Marathon. Unfortunately, however, they were inclined to  be fickle; and when they saw that Miltiades occupied such a high rank,  many began to envy him.    Themistocles was particularly jealous of the great honors that his  friend had won. His friends soon noticed his gloomy, discontented looks;  and when they inquired what caused them, Themistocles said it was  because the thought of the trophies of Miltiades would not let him  sleep. Some time after, when he saw that Miltiades was beginning to  misuse his power, he openly showed his dislike.    Not very far from Athens, out in the AEgean Sea, was the Island of  Pa'ros. The people living there were enemies of Miltiades; and he, being  sole head of the fleet, led it thither to avenge his personal wrongs.    The expedition failed, however; and Miltiades came back to Athens,  where Themistocles and the indignant citizens accused him of betraying  his trust, tried him, and convicted him of treason.    Had they not remembered the service that he had rendered his country in  defeating the Persians at Marathon, they would surely have condemned him  to death. As it was, the jury merely sentenced him to pay a heavy fine,  saying that he should remain in prison until it was paid.    Miltiades was not rich enough to raise this large sum of money, so he  died in prison. His son Ci'mon went to claim his body, so that he might  bury it properly; but the hard-hearted judges refused to let him have it  until he had paid his father's debt.    Thus forced to turn away without his father's corpse, Cimon visited his  friends, who lent him the necessary money. Miltiades, who had been the  idol of the people, was now buried hurriedly and in secret, because the  ungrateful Athenians had forgotten all the good he had done them, and  remembered only his faults.          XLVI. ARISTIDES THE JUST.      The Athenians were very happy, because they thought, that, having once  defeated the Persians, they need fear them no more. They were greatly  mistaken, however. The Great King had twice seen his preparations come  to naught and his plans ruined, but he was not yet ready to give up the  hope of conquering Greece.    On the contrary, he solemnly swore that he would return with a greater  army than ever, and make himself master of the proud city which had  defied him. These plans were suspected by Themistocles, who therefore  urged the Athenians to strengthen their navy, so that they might be  ready for war when it came.    Aristides, the other general, was of the opinion that it was useless to  build any more ships, but that the Athenians should increase their land  forces. As each general had a large party, many quarrels soon arose. It  became clear before long, that, unless one of the two leaders left the  town, there would be an outbreak of civil war.    All the Athenians, therefore, gathered together in the market place,  where they were to vote for or against the banishment of one of the  leaders. Of course, on this great occasion, all the workmen left their  labors, and even the farmers came in from the fields.    Aristides was walking about among the voters, when a farmer stopped him.  The man did not know who he was, but begged him to write his vote down  on the shell, for he had never even learned to read.    \"What name shall I write?\" questioned Aristides.    \"Oh, put down 'Aristides,'\" answered the farmer.    \"Why do you want him sent away? Has he ever done you any harm?\" asked  Aristides.    \"No,\" said the man, \"but I'm tired of hearing him called the Just.\"    Without saying another word, Aristides calmly wrote his own name on the  shell. When the votes were counted, they found six thousand against him:  so Aristides the Just was forced to leave his native city, and go away  into exile.    This was a second example of Athenian ingratitude; for Aristides had  never done anything wrong, but had, on the contrary, done all he could  to help his country. His enemies, however, were the men who were neither  honest nor just, and who felt that his virtues were a constant rebuke to  them; and this was the very reason why they were so anxious to get him  out of the city.          XLVII. TWO NOBLE SPARTAN YOUTHS.      Darius was in the midst of his preparations for a third expedition to  Greece, when all his plans were cut short by death. His son and  successor, Xerx'es I., now became King of Persia in his stead.    The new monarch was not inclined to renew the struggle with the Greeks;  but his courtiers and the exiled Greeks who dwelt in his palace so  persistently urged him to do it, that he finally consented. Orders were  then sent throughout the kingdom to get ready for war, and Xerxes said  that he would lead the army himself.    During eight years the constant drilling of troops, manufacture of arms,  collecting of provisions, and construction of roads, were kept up all  through Asia. A mighty fleet lay at anchor, and the king was almost  ready to start. Rumors of these great preparations had, of course, come  to the ears of the Greeks. All hearts were filled with trouble and fear;  for the coming army was far larger than the one the Athenians had  defeated at Marathon, and they could not expect to be so fortunate  again.    When the Spartans saw the terror of the people, they regretted having  angered the king by killing the Persian messengers, and wondered what  they could do to disarm his wrath.
