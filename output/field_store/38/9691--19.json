There is always one who wants to  be free, and one to remain bound.'    _M._ 'Yes; and the unwritten tradition that it is a matter of honour  never to seek to hold an unwilling partner quite negatives the law that  a marriage can only terminate when both parties desire it.'    _K._ 'I'm sure the tragedies of parting one hears of nowadays are far  worse than the occasional tragedies in the old days, caused by being  bound, and ever so much more frequent.'    _M._ 'It wouldn't be such an irony if _anyone_ were benefited, but as  far as I can see the men suffer nearly as much as the women, especially  when they are old. According to our early century newspapers, an old  bachelor or widower could always get a young and charming wife, but now  nobody will marry an elderly man, except the old ladies, and the men  don't want them.'    _K._ 'It's a pity they don't, that would solve a lot of the unhappiness  one sees around. It must be awful to be deserted in one's old age.'    _M._ 'Talking about the old newspapers, it's very amusing to read them  in the British Museum, and see what wonderful things were expected of  the leasehold marriage system when it was first legalised. All the  abuses of the old system were to disappear: divorce, adultery,  prostitution, and seduction--all the social evils were to go in one  clean sweep.'    _K._ 'How absurdly shortsighted people were then. Divorce is abolished,  it's true, but the scandals and misery, broken hearts and broken homes  that it caused are now multiplied a thousand times. Infidelity may be  less frequent, but if people have the wish and the opportunity for it  they're not likely to wait for a certain number of years, until it  ceases to be technically a sin. The same with the other evils. There  will always be a large number of men who postpone marriage for financial  or other reasons, and a large number of women who can only earn a living  in one way--the oldest profession in the world will always be kept  going! Seduction, too, is not likely to cease as long as the law is so  lenient to it. There will always be ignorant, silly, unprotected girls  and always men to take advantage of them.'    _M._ 'There seem to be just as many elderly spinsters, too, as before;  the women who don't attract men remain the same under any system, and  often they are the best women.'    _K._ 'How strange it must be _never to have had a husband!_'    _M._ 'It must be peaceful, at anyrate; but spinsters don't look any  happier than married women.'    _K._ 'I can only see one good result of the leasehold system--that women  are as anxious for motherhood now as in the early century they were  anxious to avoid it. We grow old with the fear of almost certain  desertion and loneliness before us, and the one hope for our old age is  our children----Oh! I am sorry, I forgot you had none.'    _M._ 'Never mind, I often think of it, and whenever Jack admires or pays  attention to another woman, I am in terror for fear he has found a fresh  attraction and may want to leave me. What stuff they used to write  formerly about the necessity for love being free. As if freedom were  such a glorious thing! Why, we are all slaves to some convention or  passion or theory; none of us are free, really free, and we wouldn't  like it if we were. It may be all very well for the fantastic love of  novels to be free, but that strange _need of each other_, which we call  \"love\" in real life, for want of a better term--_that_ must be forged  into a bond, or what help is it to us poor vacillating mortals? Love  must be an Anchor in real life--nothing else is any use!'            III      THE FIASCO OF FREE LOVE      'The ultimate standards by which all men judge of behaviour is the    resulting happiness or misery.'      'Conduct whose total results, immediate and remote, are injurious    is bad conduct.' --HERBERT SPENCER.      Free love has been called the most dangerous and delusive of all  marriage schemes. It is based on a wholly impossible standard of ethics.  Theoretically, it is the ideal union between the sexes, but it will only  become practical when men and women have morally advanced out of all  recognition. When people are all faithful, constant, pure-minded, and  utterly unselfish, free marriage may be worth considering. Even then,  there would be no chance for the ill-favoured and unattractive.    Under present conditions no couple living _openly_ in free love is known  to have made a success of it--a solid, permanent success, that is.  I believe there are couples who live happily together without any more  durable bond than their mutual affection, but they wisely assume the  respectable shelter of the wedding ring, and call themselves Mr and Mrs.  Thus their little fledgling of free love is not required to battle  against the overwhelming force of social ostracism. And moreover one has  no means of knowing how long these unions stand the supreme test of  time. The two notable modern instances of free love that naturally rise  to the mind are George Eliot and Mary Godwin. But both the men with whom  they mated were already married. As soon as Harriet was dead, Mary  Godwin married Shelley, and when George Lewes had passed away, George  Eliot married another man--an act which most people consider far less  pardonable in the circumstances than her irregular union with Lewes.  Even the famous Perfectionists of Oneida relapsed into ordinary marriage  on the death of their leader, Noyes, and by his own wish.    As an institution, free love seems widely practised in the East End of  London, but judging by the evidence of the police courts its results are  certainly not encouraging. I am told that the practice is common among  the cotton operatives of Lancashire. The _collage_ system is also very  prevalent in France among the working classes, and seems to answer well  enough. But only when women have the ability and the opportunity to  support themselves is free marriage at all feasible from the economic  standpoint, and even then there remains the serious question of  illegitimacy. All right-minded persons must acknowledge that the  attitude of society towards the illegitimate is unjust and cruel in the  extreme, resulting as it does in punishing the perfectly innocent. But  every grown man and woman is aware of this attitude, and those who act  in defiance of it, to please themselves or to satisfy some whim of  experiment, do so in the full knowledge that on their child will fall a  certain burden of lifelong disadvantage. Many perhaps are deterred from  breaking the moral law by this knowledge, but the number of  illegitimates born in England and Wales in 1905 was 37,300; and, in the  interests of these unfortunate victims of others' selfishness, I think  it is high time a more kindly and broad-minded attitude towards their  social disability was adopted.    I remember as a young girl going to see a play called _A Bunch of  Violets_. The heroine discovers that her husband's previous wife is  alive and that her child is therefore illegitimate. She tells her  daughter to choose between the parents, explaining the worldly  advantages of staying with her rich, influential father. The harangue  concludes with words to the effect: 'With me you will be poor and  shamed, and _you can never marry_.' Doubtless this ridiculous point of  view was adopted solely for the benefit of the young girls in the  audience, but its unreasonableness disgusted me for one. Even to the  limited intelligence of seventeen it is obvious that, since a name is of  so much importance in life, an illegitimate girl had better marry as  quickly as she possibly can, in order to obtain one!    Free love has recently been much discussed in connection with socialism,  and, thanks no doubt to the misrepresentations of certain newspapers,  the idea seems to have gained ground that the abolition of marriage and  the substitution of free love was part of the socialist programme.  No more untrue charge could possibly be made, as inquiries at the  headquarters of the various socialist bodies will quickly prove.    The people who advocate free love are very fond of arguing that so  personal a matter only concerns themselves. All who think thus should  have had a grave warning in a recent _cause celebre_, in which murder,  attempted suicide, permanent maiming, and a tangle of misery involving  innocent children down to the third generation, were proved to have  resulted from a 'free' union entered on nearly thirty years before. This  and the many other tragedies of free love, which appear in the  newspapers from time to time, seem to prove the mistake of imagining  that we are accountable to none for our actions. A relationship which  affects the future generation can never be a private and personal  matter. E. R. Chapman in a very interesting essay on marriage published  some years ago says: 'To exchange legal marriage for mere voluntary  unions, mere temporary partnerships, would be not to set love free,  but to give love its death blow by divorcing it from that higher human  element which is the note of marriage, rightly understood, and which  places regard for order, regard for the common weal above personal  interest and the mere self-gratification of the moment.'            IV      POLYGAMY AT THE POLITE DINNER-TABLE      'Last and hardest of all to eradicate in our midst, comes the    monopoly of the human heart which is known as marriage . . . this    ugly and barbaric form of serfdom has come in our own time by some    strange caprice to be regarded as of positively divine origin.'      --GRANT ALLEN.

Juice of 1 small lemon.            1/2 dozen washed figs.            Whipped Cream.            1/2 cup sugar.    PROCESS: Soak gelatine in cold water, then dissolve it in boiling water;  add sugar and stir occasionally until mixture begins to thicken, then  add wine and lemon juice. Chill a pint mold in ice water (a fancy mold  is attractive for this purpose). Separate the figs, slice them thinly  and dip some of them in the jelly and use them for decorating the mold;  then fill the mold with alternate layers of sliced figs and the mixture,  allowing the jelly to \"set\" each time before adding the slices of figs.  Chill thoroughly. Unmold jelly on serving dish and surround with whipped  cream sweetened and flavored as desired. Use pastry bag and rose tube  for this purpose.      NUT AND RAISIN CAKE              1/3 cup Cottolene.            1 cup fine sugar.            3 eggs unbeaten.            1 cup pecan nut meats.            2/3 cup raisins.            2 cups pastry flour.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            3/4 cup milk.            Grated rind of half an orange.            1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.            1/4 teaspoon mace.            1/4 teaspoon salt.    PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add  eggs, one at a time and beating each in thoroughly before adding  another. Pass nuts and raisins through meat chopper, then mix with flour  sifted with baking powder, salt and spices; add alternately to first  mixture with milk, beating constantly. Turn mixture into a well-greased  tube pan and bake thirty-five to forty minutes in a moderate oven.  Spread with    CARAMEL FROSTING WITH NUTS              1-1/4 cups soft brown sugar.            1/4 cup granulated sugar.            1/2 cup boiling water.            Whites 2 eggs.            1/2 teaspoon almond extract.            1/2 cup pecan nut meats broken in pieces.    PROCESS: Boil sugar and water together as for Boiled Frosting (see  recipe Page 56). Pour slowly onto beaten whites of eggs, beating  constantly, continue beating until frosting is nearly cool. Put pan  containing frosting in a larger vessel of boiling water, place on range  and cook until mixture granulates around sides of pan, stir constantly  while cooking. Remove from hot water and beat until frosting will keep  its shape when dropped from spoon. Add nut meats and flavoring. Spread  on cake, using wooden spoon to give surface a wave-like appearance.      ICED COFFEE    Follow directions for making Boiled Coffee, using four cups boiling  water. Chill and serve in tall glasses filled with cracked ice; add  cream and sugar.
