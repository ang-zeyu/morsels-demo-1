He slept at his lodgings; and the next  morning he was horror-struck on hearing that Sarah Stout's body had been  found drowned in the mill-stream behind her old home. That catastrophe  had actually occurred. Scarcely had the young barrister reached the  Market Place, when the miserable girl threw herself into the stream from  which her lifeless body was picked on the following morning. At the  coroner's inquest which ensued, Spencer Cowper gave his evidence with  extreme caution, withholding every fact that could be injurious to  Sarah's reputation; and the jury returned a verdict that the deceased  gentlewoman had killed herself whilst in a state of insanity.    In deep dejection Spencer Cowper continued the journey of the circuit.    But the excitement of the public was not allayed by the inquest and  subsequent funeral. It was rumored that it was no case of self-murder,  but a case of murder by the barrister, who had strangled his dishonored  victim, and had then thrown her into the river. Anxious to save their  sect from the stigma of suicide the Quakers concurred with the Tories in  charging the young man with a hideous complication of crimes. The case  against Spencer was laid before Chief Justice Holt, who at first  dismissed the accusation as absurd, but was afterwards induced to commit  the suspected man for trial; and in the July of 1699 the charge actually  came before a jury at the Hertford Assizes. Four prisoners--Spencer  Cowper, two attorneys, and a law-writer--were placed in the dock on the  charge of murdering Sarah Stout.    On the present occasion there is no need to recapitulate the ridiculous  evidence and absurd misconduct of the prosecution in this trial; though  criminal lawyers who wish to know what unfairness and irregularities  were permitted in such inquiries in the seventeenth century cannot do  better than to peruse the full report of the proceedings, which may be  found in every comprehensive legal library. In this place it is enough  to say that though the accusation was not sustained by a shadow of  legal testimony, the prejudice against the prisoners, both on the part  of a certain section of the Hertford residents and the presiding judge,  Mr. Baron Hatsel, was such that the verdict for acquittal was a  disappointment to many who heard it proclaimed by the foreman of the  jury. Narcissus Luttrell, indeed, says that the verdict was \"to the  satisfaction of the auditors;\" but in this statement the diarist was  unquestionably wrong, so far as the promoters of the prosecution were  concerned. Instead of accepting the decision without demur, they  attempted to put the prisoners again on their trial by the obsolete  process of \"appeal of murder;\" but this endeavor proving abortive, the  case was disposed of, and the prisoners' minds set at rest.    The barrister who was thus tried on a capital charge, and narrowly  escaped a sentence that would have consigned him to an ignominious  death, resumed his practice in the law courts, sat in the House of  Commons and rose to be a judge in the Court of Common Pleas. It is said  that he \"presided on many trials for murder; ever cautious and  mercifully inclined--remembering the great peril which he himself had  undergone.\"    The same writer who aspersed Somers with her unchaste thoughts, and  reiterated the charge of bigamy against Lord Chancellor Cowper, did not  omit to give a false and malicious version to the incidents which had  acutely wounded the fine sensibilities of the younger Cowper. But enough  notice has been taken of the 'New Atalantis' in this chapter. To that  repulsive book we refer those readers who may wish to peruse Mrs.  Manley's account of Sarah Stout's death.    A distorted tradition of Sarah Stout's tragic end, and of Lord Cowper's  imputed bigamy, was contributed to an early number of the 'European' by  a clerical authority--the Rev. J. Hinton, Rector of Alderton, in  Northamptonshire. \"Mrs. Sarah Stout,\" says the writer, \"whose death was  charged upon Spencer Cowper, was strangled accidentally by drawing the  steenkirk too tight upon her neck, as she, with four or five young  persons, were at a game of romp upon the staircase; but it was not done  by Mr. Cowper, though one of the company. Mrs. Clavering, Lord  Chancellor Cowper's second wife, whom he married during the life of his  first, was there too; they were so confounded with the accident, that  they foolishly resolved to throw her into the water, thinking it would  pass that she had drowned herself.\" This charming paragraph illustrates  the vitality of scandal, and at the same time shows how ludicrously  rumor and tradition mistell stories in the face of evidence.    Spencer Cowper's second son, the Rev. John Cowper, D.D., was the father  of William Cowper, the poet.          CHAPTER XI.    EARLY MARRIAGES.      Notwithstanding his illustrious descent, Simon Harcourt raised himself  to the woolsack by his own exertions, and was in no degree indebted to  powerful relatives for his elevation. The son of a knight, whose loyalty  to the House of Stuart had impoverished his estate, he spent his  student-days at Pembroke, Oxford, and the Inner Temple, in resolute  labor, and with few indulgences. His father could make him but a slender  allowance; and when he assumed the gown of a barrister, the future  Chancellor, like Erskine in after years, was spurred to industry by the  voices of his wife and children. Whilst he was still an undergraduate of  the university, he fell in love with Rebecca Clark, daughter of a pious  man, of whose vocation the modern peerages are ashamed. Sir Philip  Harcourt (the Chancellor's father) in spite of his loyalty quarrelled  with the Established Church, and joined the Presbyterians: and Thomas  Clark was his Presbyterian chaplain, secretary, and confidential  servant. Great was Sir Philip's wrath on learning that his boy had not  only fallen in love with Rebecca Clark, but had married her privately.  It is probable that the event lowered the worthy knight's esteem for the  Presbyterian system; but as anger could not cut the nuptial bond, the  father relented--gave the young people all the assistance he could, and  hoped that they would live long without repenting their folly. The match  turned out far better than the old knight feared. Taking his humble  bride to modest chambers, young Harcourt applied sedulously to the study  of the law; and his industry was rewarded by success, and by the  gratitude of a dutiful wife. In unbroken happiness they lived together  for a succession of years, and their union was fruitful of children.    Harcourt fared better with his love-match than Sergeant Hill with his  heiress, Miss Medlycott of Cottingham, Northamptonshire. On the morning  of his wedding the eccentric sergeant, having altogether forgotten his  most important engagement for the day, received his clients in chambers  after his usual practice, and remained busy with professional cares  until a band of devoted friends forcibly carried him to the church,  where his bride had been waiting for him more than an hour. The ceremony  having been duly performed, he hastened back to his chambers, to be  present at a consultation. Notwithstanding her sincere affection for  him, the lady proved but an indifferent wife to the black-letter lawyer.  Empowered by Act of Parliament to retain her maiden-name after  marriage, she showed her disesteem for her husband's patronymic by her  mode of exercising the privilege secured to her by special law; and many  a time the sergeant indignantly insisted that she should use his name in  her signatures. \"My name is Hill, madam; my father's name was Hill,  madam; all the Hills have been named Hill, madam; Hill is a good  name--and by ----, madam, you _shall_ use it.\" On other matters he was  more compliant--humoring her old-maidish fancies in a most docile and  conciliating manner. Curiously neat and orderly, Mrs. Medlycott took  great pride in the faultlessness of her domestic arrangements, so far as  cleanliness and precise order were concerned. To maintain the whiteness  of the pipe-clayed steps before the front door of her Bedford Square  mansion was a chief object of her existence; and to gratify her in this  particular, Sergeant Hill use daily to leave his premises by the kitchen  steps. Having outlived the lady, Hill observed to a friend who was  condoling with him on his recent bereavement, \"Ay, my poor wife is gone!  She was a good sort of woman--in _her_ way a _very_ good sort of woman.  I do honestly declare my belief that in _her_ way she had no equal.  But--but--I'll tell you something in confidence. If ever I marry again,  _I won't marry merely for money_.\" The learned sergeant died in his  ninety-third year without having made a second marriage.    Like Harcourt, John Scott married under circumstances that called forth  many warm expressions of censure; and like Harcourt, he, in after life,  reflected on his imprudent marriage as one of the most fortunate steps  of his earlier career. The romance of the law contains few more pleasant  episodes than the story of handsome Jack Scott's elopement with Bessie  Surtees. There is no need to tell in detail how the comely Oxford  scholar danced with the banker's daughter at the Newcastle assemblies;  how his suit was at first recognised by the girl's parents, although the  Scotts were but rich 'fitters,' whereas Aubone Surtees, Esquire, was a  banker and gentleman of honorable descent; how, on the appearance of an  aged and patrician suitor for Bessie's hand, papa and mamma told Jack  Scott not to presume on their condescension, and counseled Bessie to  throw her lover over and become the lady of Sir William Blackett; how  Bessie was faithful, and Jack was urgent; how they had secret interviews  on Tyne-side and in London, meeting clandestinely on horseback and on  foot, corresponding privately by letters and confidential messengers;  how,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#16)"],[1,"heard you! Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself heard  you!'    'Heard me!' said the Butterfly. 'Of course he did. I meant him to hear  me.'    'And what did he say? Oh, what did he say?'    'Well,' said the Butterfly, fanning himself most importantly, 'between  you and me, my dear--of course I don't blame him, because his Palace  must have cost a great deal and the oranges are just ripening,--he asked  me not to stamp, and I promised I wouldn't.'    'Gracious!' said his wife, and sat quite quiet; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud  laughed till the tears ran down his face at the impudence of the bad  little Butterfly.    Balkis the Most Beautiful stood up behind the tree among the red lilies  and smiled to herself, for she had heard all this talk. She thought,  'If I am wise I can yet save my Lord from the persecutions of these  quarrelsome Queens,' and she held out her finger and whispered softly to  the Butterfly's Wife, 'Little woman, come here.' Up flew the Butterfly's  Wife, very frightened, and clung to Balkis's white hand.    Balkis bent her beautiful head down and whispered, 'Little woman, do you  believe what your husband has just said?'    The Butterfly's Wife looked at Balkis, and saw the most beautiful  Queen's eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on them, and she  picked up her courage with both wings and said, 'O Queen, be lovely for  ever. You know what men-folk are like.'    And the Queen Balkis, the Wise Balkis of Sheba, put her hand to her lips  to hide a smile and said, 'Little sister, I know.'    'They get angry,' said the Butterfly's Wife, fanning herself quickly,  'over nothing at all, but we must humour them, O Queen. They never mean  half they say. If it pleases my husband to believe that I believe he  can make Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace disappear by stamping his foot, I'm  sure I don't care. He'll forget all about it to-morrow.'    'Little sister,' said Balkis, 'you are quite right; but next time he  begins to boast, take him at his word. Ask him to stamp, and see what  will happen. We know what men-folk are like, don't we? He'll be very  much ashamed.'    Away flew the Butterfly's Wife to her husband, and in five minutes they  were quarrelling worse than ever.    'Remember!' said the Butterfly. 'Remember what I can do if I stamp my  foot.'    'I don't believe you one little bit,' said the Butterfly's Wife. 'I  should very much like to see it done. Suppose you stamp now.'    'I promised Suleiman-bin-Daoud that I wouldn't,' said the Butterfly,  'and I don't want to break my promise.'    'It wouldn't matter if you did,' said his wife. 'You couldn't bend  a blade of grass with your stamping. I dare you to do it,' she said.  Stamp! Stamp! Stamp!'    Suleiman-bin-Daoud, sitting under the camphor-tree, heard every word  of this, and he laughed as he had never laughed in his life before. He  forgot all about his Queens; he forgot all about the Animal that came  out of the sea; he forgot about showing off. He just laughed with joy,  and Balkis, on the other side of the tree, smiled because her own true  love was so joyful.    Presently the Butterfly, very hot and puffy, came whirling back under  the shadow of the camphor-tree and said to Suleiman, 'She wants me to  stamp! She wants to see what will happen, O Suleiman-bin-Daoud! You know  I can't do it, and now she'll never believe a word I say. She'll laugh  at me to the end of my days!'    'No, little brother,' said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, 'she will never laugh at  you again,' and he turned the ring on his finger--just for the little  Butterfly's sake, not for the sake of showing off,--and, lo and behold,  four huge Djinns came out of the earth!    'Slaves,' said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, 'when this gentleman on my finger'  (that was where the impudent Butterfly was sitting) 'stamps his left  front forefoot you will make my Palace and these gardens disappear in  a clap of thunder. When he stamps again you will bring them back  carefully.'    'Now, little brother,' he said, 'go back to your wife and stamp all  you've a mind to.'    Away flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was crying, 'I dare you to do  it! I dare you to do it! Stamp! Stamp now! Stamp!' Balkis saw the four  vast Djinns stoop down to the four corners of the gardens with the  Palace in the middle, and she clapped her hands softly and said, 'At  last Suleiman-bin-Daoud will do for the sake of a Butterfly what he  ought to have done long ago for his own sake, and the quarrelsome Queens  will be frightened!'    The the butterfly stamped. The Djinns jerked the Palace and the gardens  a thousand miles into the air: there was a most awful thunder-clap, and  everything grew inky-black. The Butterfly's Wife fluttered about in the  dark, crying, 'Oh, I'll be good! I'm so sorry I spoke. Only bring the  gardens back, my dear darling husband, and I'll never contradict again.'    The Butterfly was nearly as frightened as his wife, and  Suleiman-bin-Daoud laughed so much that it was several minutes before  he found breath enough to whisper to the Butterfly, 'Stamp again, little  brother. Give me back my Palace, most great magician.'    'Yes, give him back his Palace,' said the Butterfly's Wife, still flying  about in the dark like a moth. 'Give him back his Palace, and don't  let's have any more horrid.magic.'    'Well, my dear,' said the Butterfly as bravely as he could, 'you see  what your nagging has led to. Of course it doesn't make any difference  to me--I'm used to this kind of thing--but as a favour to you and to  Suleiman-bin-Daoud I don't mind putting things right.'    So he stamped once more, and that instant the Djinns let down the Palace  and the gardens, without even a bump. The sun shone on the dark-green  orange leaves; the fountains played among the pink Egyptian lilies; the  birds went on singing, and the Butterfly's Wife lay on her side under  the camphor-tree waggling her wings and panting, 'Oh, I'll be good! I'll  be good!'    Suleiman-bin-Daolld could hardly speak for laughing. He leaned back all  weak and hiccoughy, and shook his finger at the Butterfly and said, 'O  great wizard, what is the sense of returning to me my Palace if at the  same time you slay me with mirth!'    Then came a terrible noise, for all the nine hundred and ninety-nine  Queens ran out of the Palace shrieking and shouting and calling for  their babies. They hurried down the great marble steps below the  fountain, one hundred abreast, and the Most Wise Balkis went statelily  forward to meet them and said, 'What is your trouble, O Queens?'    They stood on the marble steps one hundred abreast and shouted, 'What is  our trouble? We were living peacefully in our golden palace, as is our  custom, when upon a sudden the Palace disappeared, and we were left  sitting in a thick and noisome darkness; and it thundered, and Djinns  and Afrits moved about in the darkness! That is our trouble, O Head  Queen, and we are most extremely troubled on account of that trouble,  for it was a troublesome trouble, unlike any trouble we have known.'    Then Balkis the Most Beautiful Queen--Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Very Best  Beloved--Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of the Gold  of the South--from the Desert of Zinn to the Towers of Zimbabwe--Balkis,  almost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself, said, 'It  is nothing, O Queens! A Butterfly has made complaint against his  wife because she quarrelled with him, and it has pleased our Lord  Suleiman-bin-Daoud to teach her a lesson in low-speaking and humbleness,  for that is counted a virtue among the wives of the butterflies.'    Then up and spoke an Egyptian Queen--the daughter of a Pharoah--and she  said, 'Our Palace cannot be plucked up by the roots like a leek for the  sake of a little insect. No! Suleiman-bin-Daoud must be dead, and what  we heard and saw was the earth thundering and darkening at the news.'    Then Balkis beckoned that bold Queen without looking at her, and said to  her and to the others, 'Come and see.'    They came down the marble steps, one hundred abreast, and beneath his  camphor-tree, still weak with laughing, they saw the Most Wise King  Suleiman-bin-Daoud rocking back and forth with a Butterfly on either  hand, and they heard him say, 'O wife of my brother in the air, remember  after this, to please your husband in all things, lest he be provoked to  stamp his foot yet again; for he has said that he is used to this magic,  and he is most eminently a great magician--one who steals away the very  Palace of Suleirnan-bin-Daoud himself. Go in peace, little folk!' And he  kissed them on the wings, and they flew away.    Then all the Queens except Balkis--the Most Beautiful and Splendid  Balkis, who stood apart smiling--fell flat on their faces, for they  said, 'If these things are done when a Butterfly is displeased with  his wife, what shall be done to us who have vexed our King with our  loud-speaking and open quarrelling through many days?'    Then they put their veils over their heads, and they put their hands  over their mouths, and they tiptoed back to the Palace most mousy-quiet.    Then Balkis--The Most Beautiful and Excellent Balkis--went forward  through the red lilies into the shade of the camphor-tree and laid  her hand upon Suleiman-bin-Daoud's shoulder and said, 'O my Lord and  Treasure of my Soul, rejoice, for we have taught the Queens of Egypt and  Ethiopia and Abyssinia and Persia and India and China with a great and a  memorable teaching.'    And Suleiman-bin-Daoud, still looking after the Butterflies where they  played in the sunlight, said, 'O my Lady and Jewel of my Felicity, when  did this happen? For I have been jesting with a Butterfly ever since I  came into the garden.' And he told Balkis what he had done.    Balkis--The tender and Most Lovely Balkis--said, 'O my Lord and Regent  of my Existence, I hid behind the camphor-tree and saw it all. It was I  who told the Butterfly's Wife to ask the Butterfly to stamp,"]]]
