The difficulty with Jersey was that its seacoast was a monotonous line  of breakers with dangerous shoal inlets, few harbors, and vast mosquito  infested salt marshes and sandy thickets. In the interior it was for  the most part a level, heavily forested, sandy, swampy country in its  southern portions, and rough and mountainous in the northern portions.  Even the entrance by Delaware Bay was so difficult by reason of its  shoals that it was the last part of the coast to be explored. The  Delaware region and Jersey were in fact a sort of middle ground far less  easy of access by the sea than the regions to the north in New England  and to the south in Virginia.    There were only two places easy of settlement in the Jerseys. One was  the open region of meadows and marshes by Newark Bay near the mouth  of the Hudson and along the Hackensack River, whence the people slowly  extended themselves to the seashore at Sandy Hook and thence southward  along the ocean beach. This was East Jersey. The other easily occupied  region, which became West Jersey, stretched along the shore of the lower  Delaware from the modern Trenton to Salem, whence the settlers gradually  worked their way into the interior. Between these two divisions lay  a rough wilderness which in its southern portion was full of swamps,  thickets, and pine barrens. So rugged was the country that the native  Indians lived for the most part only in the two open regions already  described.    The natural geographical, geological, and even social division of New  Jersey is made by drawing a line from Trenton to the mouth of the Hudson  River. North of that line the successive terraces of the piedmont and  mountainous region form part of the original North American continent.  South of that line the more or less sandy level region was once a shoal  beneath the ocean; afterwards a series of islands; then one island with  a wide sound behind it passing along the division line to the mouth of  the Hudson. Southern Jersey was in short an island with a sound behind  it very much like the present Long Island. The shoal and island had been  formed in the far distant geologic past by the erosion and washings from  the lofty Pennsylvania mountains now worn down to mere stumps.    The Delaware River flowed into this sound at Trenton. Gradually the  Hudson end of the sound filled up as far as Trenton, but the tide from  the ocean still runs up the remains of the Old Sound as far as Trenton.  The Delaware should still be properly considered as ending at Trenton,  for the rest of its course to the ocean is still part of Old Pensauken  Sound, as it is called by geologists.    The Jerseys originated as a colony in 1664. In 1675 West Jersey passed  into the control of the Quakers. In 1680 East Jersey came partially  under Quaker influence. In August, 1664, Charles II seized New York, New  Jersey, and all the Dutch possessions in America, having previously  in March granted them to his brother the Duke of York. The Duke almost  immediately gave to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, members of  the Privy Council and defenders of the Stuart family in the Cromwellian  wars, the land between the Delaware River and the ocean, and bounded  on the north by a line drawn from latitude 41 degrees on the Hudson to  latitude 41 degrees 40 minutes on the Delaware. This region was to be  called, the grant said, Nova Caesarea, or New Jersey. The name was a  compliment to Carteret, who in the Cromwellian wars had defended the  little isle of Jersey against the forces of the Long Parliament. As the  American Jersey was then almost an island and geologically had been one,  the name was not inappropriate.    Berkeley and Carteret divided the province between them. In 1676 an  exact division was attempted, creating the rather unnatural sections  known as East Jersey and West Jersey. The first idea seems to have been  to divide by a line running from Barnegat on the seashore to the mouth  of Pensauken Creek on the Delaware just above Camden. This, however,  would have made a North Jersey and a South Jersey, with the latter much  smaller than the former. Several lines seem to have been surveyed at  different times in the attempt to make an exactly equal division, which  was no easy engineering task. As private land titles and boundaries were  in some places dependent on the location of the division line, there  resulted much controversy and litigation which lasted down into our  own time. Without going into details, it is sufficient to say that the  acceptable division line began on the seashore at Little Egg Harbor at  the lower end of Barnegat Bay and crossed diagonally or northwesterly to  the northern part of the Delaware River just above the Water Gap. It is  known as the Old Province line, and it can be traced on any map of the  State by prolonging, in both directions, the northeastern boundary of  Burlington County.    West Jersey, which became decidedly Quaker, did not remain long in the  possession of Lord Berkeley. He was growing old; and, disappointed in  his hopes of seeing it settled, he sold it, in 1673, for one thousand  pounds to John Fenwick and Edward Byllinge, both of them old Cromwellian  soldiers turned Quakers. That this purchase was made for the purpose  of affording a refuge in America for Quakers then much imprisoned and  persecuted in England does not very distinctly appear. At least there  was no parade of it. But such a purpose in addition to profit for the  proprietors may well have been in the minds of the purchasers.    George Fox, the Quaker leader, had just returned from a missionary  journey in America, in the course of which he had traveled through New  Jersey in going from New York to Maryland. Some years previously in  England, about 1659, he had made inquiries as to a suitable place for  Quaker settlement and was told of the region north of Maryland which  became Pennsylvania. But how could a persecuted sect obtain such a  region from the British Crown and the Government that was persecuting  them? It would require powerful influence at Court; nothing could then  be done about it; and Pennsylvania had to wait until William Penn became  a man with influence enough in 1681 to win it from the Crown. But here  was West Jersey, no longer owned directly by the Crown and bought in  cheap by two Quakers. It was an unexpected opportunity. Quakers soon  went to it, and it was the first Quaker colonial experiment.    Byllinge and Fenwick, though turned Quakers, seem to have retained  some of the contentious Cromwellian spirit of their youth. They soon  quarreled over their respective interests in the ownership of West  Jersey; and to prevent a lawsuit, so objectionable to Quakers, the  decision was left to William Penn, then a rising young Quaker about  thirty years old, dreaming of ideal colonies in America. Penn awarded  Fenwick a one-tenth interest and four hundred pounds. Byllinge soon  became insolvent and turned over his nine-tenths interest to his  creditors, appointing Penn and two other Quakers, Gawen Lawrie, a  merchant of London, and Nicholas Lucas, a maltster of Hertford, to hold  it in trust for them. Gawen Lawrie afterwards became deputy governor of  East Jersey. Lucas was one of those thoroughgoing Quakers just released  from eight years in prison for his religion. *          * Myers, \"Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West Jersey, and  Delaware\", p. 180.    Fenwick also in the end fell into debt and, after selling over one  hundred thousand acres to about fifty purchasers, leased what remained  of his interest for a thousand years to John Edridge, a tanner, and  Edmund Warner, a poulterer, as security for money borrowed from them.  They conveyed this lease and their claims to Penn, Lawrie, and Lucas,  who thus became the owners, as trustees, of pretty much all West Jersey.    This was William Penn's first practical experience in American affairs.  He and his fellow trustees, with the consent of Fenwick, divided the  West Jersey ownership into one hundred shares. The ninety belonging to  Byllinge were offered for sale to settlers or to creditors of Byllinge  who would take them in exchange for debts. The settlement of West Jersey  thus became the distribution of an insolvent Quaker's estate among his  creditor fellow religionists.    Although no longer in possession of a title to land, Fenwick, in 1675,  went out with some Quaker settlers to Delaware Bay. There they founded  the modern town of Salem, which means peace, giving it that name because  of the fair and peaceful aspect of the wilderness on the day they  arrived. They bought the land from the Indians in the usual manner,  as the Swedes and Dutch had so often done. But they had no charter or  provision for organized government. When Fenwick attempted to exercise  political authority at Salem, he was seized and imprisoned by Andros,  Governor of New York for the Duke of York, on the ground that, although  the Duke had given Jersey to certain individual proprietors, the  political control of it remained in the Duke's deputy governor. Andros,  who had levied a tax of five per cent on all goods passing up the  Delaware, now established commissioners at Salem to collect the duties.    This action brought up the whole question of the authority of Andros.  The trustee proprietors of West Jersey appealed to the Duke of York, who  was suspiciously indifferent to the matter, but finally referred it  for decision to a prominent lawyer, Sir William Jones, before whom the  Quaker proprietors of West Jersey made a most excellent argument. They  showed the illegality, injustice, and wrong of depriving the Jerseys  of vested political rights and forcing them from the freeman's right  of making their own laws to a state of mere dependence on the arbitrary  will of one man. Then with much boldness they declared that \"To exact  such an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#16)"],[1,"hes]     [Picture: The same spot as it appears to-day.  The figure in the picture                  is standing in what remains of the trench]    After that, as I had a bad attack of sciatica and no place to sleep and  nothing to eat, I accepted Crane's offer of a blanket and coffee at his  bivouac near El Poso.  On account of the sciatica I was not able to walk  fast, and, although for over a mile of the way the trail was under fire,  Crane and Hare each insisted on giving me an arm, and kept step with my  stumblings.  Whenever I protested and refused their sacrifice and pointed  out the risk they were taking they smiled as at the ravings of a naughty  child, and when I lay down in the road and refused to budge unless they  left me, Crane called the attention of Hare to the effect of the setting  sun behind the palm-trees.  To the reader all these little things that  one remembers seem very little indeed, but they were vivid at the moment,  and I have always thought of them as stretching over a long extent of  time and territory.  Before I revisited San Juan I would have said that  the distance along the road from the point where I left the artillery to  where I joined Wood was three-quarters of a mile.  When I paced it later  I found the distance was about seventy-five yards.  I do not urge my  stupidity or my extreme terror as a proof that others would be as greatly  confused, but, if only for the sake of the stupid ones, it seems a pity  that the landmarks of San Juan should not be rescued from the jungle, and  a few sign-posts placed upon the hills.  It is true that the great  battles of the Civil War and those of the one in Manchuria, where the men  killed and wounded in a day outnumber all those who fought on both sides  at San Juan, make that battle read like a skirmish.  But the Spanish War  had its results.  At least it made Cuba into a republic, and so enriched  or burdened us with colonies that our republic changed into something  like an empire.  But I do not urge that.  It will never be because San  Juan changed our foreign policy that people will visit the spot, and will  send from it picture postal cards.  The human interest alone will keep  San Juan alive.  The men who fought there came from every State in our  country and from every class of our social life.  We sent there the best  of our regular army, and with them, cowboys, clerks, bricklayers,  foot-ball players, three future commanders of the greater army that  followed that war, the future Governor of Cuba, future commanders of the  Philippines, the commander of our forces in China, a future President of  the United States.  And, whether these men, when they returned to their  homes again, became clerks and millionaires and dentists, or rose to be  presidents and mounted policemen, they all remember very kindly the days  they lay huddled together in the trenches on that hot and glaring  sky-line.  And there must be many more besides who hold the place in  memory.  There are few in the United States so poor in relatives and  friends who did not in his or her heart send a substitute to Cuba.  For  these it seems as though San Juan might be better preserved, not as it  is, for already its aspect is too far changed to wish for that, but as it  was.  The efforts already made to keep the place in memory and to honor  the Americans who died there are the public park which I have mentioned,  the monument on San Juan, and one other monument at Guasimas to the  regulars and Rough Riders who were killed there.  To these monuments the  Society of Santiago will add four more, which will mark the landing place  of the army at Daiquairi and the fights at Guasimas, El Caney, and San  Juan Hill.    But I believe even more than this might be done to preserve to the place  its proper values.  These values are sentimental, historical, and  possibly to the military student, educational.  If to-day there were  erected at Daiquairi, Siboney, Guasimas, El Poso, El Caney, and on and  about San Juan a dozen iron or bronze tablets that would tell from where  certain regiments advanced, what posts they held, how many or how few  were the men who held those positions, how near they were to the trenches  of the enemy, and by whom these men were commanded, I am sure the place  would reconstruct itself and would breathe with interest, not only for  the returning volunteer, but for any casual tourist.  As it is, the  history of the fight and the reputation of the men who fought is now at  the mercy of the caretaker of the park and the Cuban \"guides\" from the  hotel.  The caretaker speaks only Spanish, and, considering the amount of  misinformation the guides disseminate, it is a pity when they are talking  to Americans, they are not forced to use the same language.  When last I  visited it, Carlos Portuondo was the official guardian of San Juan Hill.  He is an aged Cuban, and he fought through the Ten Years' War, but during  the last insurrection and the Spanish-American War he not only was not  near San Juan, but was not even on the Island of Cuba.  He is a charming  old person, and so is his aged wife.  Their chief concern in life, when I  saw them, was to sell me a pair of breeches made of palm-fibre which  Carlos had worn throughout the entire ten years of battle.  The  vicissitudes of those trousers he recited to me in great detail, and he  very properly regarded them as of historic value.  But of what happened  at San Juan he knew nothing, and when I asked him why he held his present  post and occupied the Block-House, he said, \"To keep the cows out of the  park.\"  When I asked him where the Americans had camped, he pointed  carefully from the back door of the Block-House to the foot of his  kitchen-garden.  I assured him that under no stress of terror could the  entire American army have been driven into his back yard, and pointed out  where it had stretched along the ridge of hills for five miles.  He  politely but unmistakably showed that he thought I was a liar.  From the  Venus Hotel there were two guides, old Casanova and Jean Casanova, his  languid and good-natured son, a youth of sixteen years.  Old Casanova,  like most Cubans, is not inclined to give much credit for what they did  in Cuba to the Americans.  After all, he says, they came only just as the  Cubans themselves were about to conquer the Spaniards, and by a lucky  chance received the surrender and then claimed all the credit.  As other  Cubans told me, \"Had the Americans left us alone a few weeks longer, we  would have ended the war.\"  How they were to have taken Havana, and sunk  Cervera's fleet, and why they were not among those present when our men  charged San Juan, I did not inquire.  Old Casanova, again like other  Cubans, ranks the fighting qualities of the Spaniard much higher than  those of the American.  This is only human.   It must be annoying to a  Cuban to remember that after he had for three years fought the Spaniard,  the Yankee in eight weeks received his surrender and began to ship him  home.  The way Casanova describes the fight at El Caney is as follows:    \"The Americans thought they could capture El Caney in one day, but the  brave General Toral fought so good that it was six days before the  Americans could make the Spaniards surrender.\"  The statement is correct  except as regards the length of time during which the fight lasted.  The  Americans did make the mistake of thinking they could eat up El Caney in  an hour and then march through it to San Juan.  Owing to the splendid  courage of Toral and his few troops our soldiers, under two of our best  generals, were held in check from seven in the morning until two in the  afternoon.  But the difference between seven hours of one day and six  days is considerable.  Still, at present at San Juan that is the sort of  information upon which the patriotic and puzzled American tourist is fed.    Young Casanova, the only other authority in Santiago, is not so sure of  his facts as is his father, and is willing to learn.  He went with me to  hold my pony while I took the photographs that accompany this article,  and I listened with great interest to his accounts of the battle.  Finally he made a statement that was correct.  \"How did you happen to get  that right?\" I asked.    \"Yesterday,\" he said, \"I guided Colonel Hayes here, and while I guided  him he explained it to me.\"          THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR      I--WITH BULLER'S COLUMN      \"Were you the station-master here before this?\" I asked the man in the  straw hat, at Colenso.  \"I mean before this war?\"    \"No fear!\" snorted the station-master, scornfully.  \"Why, we didn't know  Colenso was on the line until Buller fought a battle here.  That's how it  is with all these way-stations now.  Everybody's talking about them.  We  never took no notice to them.\"    And yet the arriving stranger might have been forgiven his point of view  and his start of surprise when he found Chieveley a place of only a half  dozen corrugated zinc huts, and Colenso a scattered gathering of a dozen  shattered houses of battered brick.    Chieveley seemed so insignificant in contrast with its fame to those who  had followed the war on maps and in the newspapers, that one was not sure  he was on the right road until he saw from the car-window the armored  train still lying on the embankment, the graves beside it, and the donga  into which Winston Churchill pulled and carried the wounded.    And as the train bumped and halted before the blue and white enamel sign  that marks Colenso station, the places which have made that spot familiar  and momentous fell into line like the buoys which mark the entrance to a  harbor.    We knew that the high bare ridge to the right must be Fort Wylie, that  the plain on the left was where Colonel Long had lost his artillery, and  three officers gained the Victoria Cross, and that the swift, muddy  stream, in which the iron railroad bridge lay humped and sprawling,"]]]
