Madame was so  whimsical, and her disposition so changeable. She soon allowed this to  be perceived, for, suddenly, opening the conversation, she said: \"Well!  have you nothing to say to me?\"    He imagined she must have guessed his thoughts; he fancied (for those  who are in love are thus constituted, being as credulous and blind as  poets or prophets), he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see  her, and also the subject uppermost in his mind.    \"Yes, Madame,\" he said, \"and I think it very singular.\"    \"The affair of the bracelets,\" she exclaimed, eagerly, \"you mean that, I  suppose?\"    \"Yes, Madame.\"    \"And you think the king is in love; do you not?\"    Guiche looked at her for some time; her eyes sank under his gaze, which  seemed to read her very heart.    \"I think,\" he said, \"that the king may possibly have had an idea of  annoying some one; were it not for that, the king would hardly show  himself so earnest in his attentions as he is; he would not run the risk  of compromising, from mere thoughtlessness of disposition, a young girl  against whom no one has been hitherto able to say a word.\"    \"Indeed! the bold, shameless girl,\" said the princess, haughtily.    \"I can positively assure your royal highness,\" said De Guiche, with a  firmness marked by great respect, \"that Mademoiselle de la Valliere  is beloved by a man who merits every respect, for he is a brave and  honorable gentleman.\"    \"Bragelonne?\"    \"My friend; yes, Madame.\"    \"Well, and though he is your friend, what does that matter to the king?\"    \"The king knows that Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la  Valliere; and as Raoul has served the king most valiantly, the king will  not inflict an irreparable injury upon him.\"    Madame began to laugh in a manner that produced a sinister impression  upon De Guiche.    \"I repeat, Madame, I do not believe the king is in love with  Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and the proof that I do not believe it is,  that I was about to ask you whose _amour propre_ it is likely the king  is desirous of wounding? You, who are well acquainted with the whole  court, can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that; and assuredly, with  greater certainty, since it is everywhere said that your royal highness  is on very friendly terms with the king.\"    Madame bit her lips, and, unable to assign any good and sufficient  reasons, changed the conversation. \"Prove to me,\" she said, fixing on  him one of those looks in which the whole soul seems to pass into the  eyes, \"prove to me, I say, that you intended to interrogate me at the  very moment I sent for you.\"    De Guiche gravely drew from his pocket the now crumpled note that he had  written, and showed it to her.    \"Sympathy,\" she said.    \"Yes,\" said the comte, with an indescribable tenderness of tone,  \"sympathy. I have explained to you how and why I sought you; you,  however, have yet to tell me, Madame, why you sent for me.\"    \"True,\" replied the princess. She hesitated, and then suddenly  exclaimed, \"Those bracelets will drive me mad.\"    \"You expected the king would offer them to you,\" replied De Guiche.    \"Why not?\"    \"But before you, Madame, before you, his sister-in-law, was there not  the queen herself to whom the king should have offered them?\"    \"Before La Valliere,\" cried the princess, wounded to the quick, \"could  he not have presented them to me? Was there not the whole court, indeed,  to choose from?\"    \"I assure you, Madame,\" said the comte, respectfully, \"that if any one  heard you speak in this manner, if any one were to see how red your eyes  are, and, Heaven forgive me, to see, too, that tear trembling on your  eyelids, it would be said that your royal highness was jealous.\"    \"Jealous!\" said the princess, haughtily, \"jealous of La Valliere!\"    She expected to see De Guiche yield beneath her scornful gesture and her  proud tone; but he simply and boldly replied, \"Jealous of La Valliere;  yes, Madame.\"    \"Am I to suppose, monsieur,\" she stammered out, \"that your object is to  insult me?\"    \"It is not possible, Madame,\" replied the comte, slightly agitated, but  resolved to master that fiery nature.    \"Leave the room!\" said the princess, thoroughly exasperated, De Guiche's  coolness and silent respect having made her completely lose her temper.    De Guiche fell back a step, bowed slowly, but with great respect, drew  himself up, looking as white as his lace cuffs, and, in a voice slightly  trembling, said, \"It was hardly worth while to have hurried here to be  subjected to this unmerited disgrace.\" And he turned away with hasty  steps.    He had scarcely gone half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a  tigress after him, seized him by the cuff, and making him turn round  again, said, trembling with passion as she did so, \"The respect you  pretend to have is more insulting than the insult itself. Insult me, if  you please, but at least speak.\"    \"Madame,\" said the comte, gently, as he drew his sword, \"thrust this  blade into my heart, rather than kill me by degrees.\"    At the look he fixed upon her,--a look full of love, resolution, and  despair, even,--she knew how readily the comte, so outwardly calm in  appearance, would pass his sword through his own breast if she added  another word. She tore the blade from his hands, and, pressing his arm  with a feverish impatience, which might pass for tenderness, said, \"Do  not be too hard upon me, comte. You see how I am suffering, and yet you  have no pity for me.\"    Tears, the cries of this strange attack, stifled her voice. As soon as  De Guiche saw her weep, he took her in his arms and carried her to an  armchair; in another moment she would have been suffocated.    \"Oh, why,\" he murmured, as he knelt by her side, \"why do you conceal  your troubles from me? Do you love any one--tell me? It would kill me,  I know, but not until I should have comforted, consoled, and served you  even.\"    \"And do you love me to that extent?\" she replied, completely conquered.    \"I do indeed love you to that extent, Madame.\"    She placed both her hands in his. \"My heart is indeed another's,\" she  murmured in so low a tone that her voice could hardly be heard; but he  heard it, and said, \"Is it the king you love?\"    She gently shook her head, and her smile was like a clear bright streak  in the clouds, through which after the tempest has passed one almost  fancies Paradise is opening. \"But,\" she added, \"there are other passions  in a high-born heart. Love is poetry; but the real life of the heart is  pride. Comte, I was born on a throne, I am proud and jealous of my rank.  Why does the king gather such unworthy objects round him?\"    \"Once more, I repeat,\" said the comte, \"you are acting unjustly towards  that poor girl, who will one day be my friend's wife.\"    \"Are you simple enough to believe that, comte?\"    \"If I did not believe it,\" he said, turning very pale, \"Bragelonne  should be informed of it to-morrow; indeed he should, if I thought that  poor La Valliere had forgotten the vows she had exchanged with Raoul.  But no, it would be cowardly to betray a woman's secret; it would be  criminal to disturb a friend's peace of mind.\"    \"You think, then,\" said the princess, with a wild burst of laughter,  \"that ignorance is happiness?\"    \"I believe it,\" he replied.    \"Prove it to me, then,\" she said, hurriedly.    \"It is easily done, Madame. It is reported through the whole court that  the king loves you, and that you return his affection.\"    \"Well?\" she said, breathing with difficulty.    \"Well; admit for a moment that Raoul, my friend, had come and said to  me, 'Yes, the king loves Madame, and has made an impression upon her  heart,' I possibly should have slain Raoul.\"    \"It would have been necessary,\" said the princess, with the obstinacy of  a woman who feels herself not easily overcome, \"for M. de Bragelonne to  have had proofs before he ventured to speak to you in that manner.\"    \"Such, however, is the case,\" replied De Guiche, with a deep sigh,  \"that, not having been warned, I have never examined into the matter  seriously; and I now find that my ignorance has saved my life.\"    \"So, then, you drive selfishness and coldness to that extent,\" said  Madame, \"that you would let this unhappy young man continue to love La  Valliere?\"    \"I would, until La Valliere's guilt were revealed.\"    \"But the bracelets?\"    \"Well, Madame, since you yourself expected to receive them from the  king, what can I possibly say?\"    The argument was a telling one, and the princess was overwhelmed by it,  and from that moment her defeat was assured. But as her heart and  mind were instinct with noble and generous feelings, she understood De  Guiche's extreme delicacy. She saw that in his heart he really suspected  that the king was in love with La Valliere, and that he did not wish  to resort to the common expedient of ruining a rival in the mind of  a woman, by giving the latter the assurance and certainty that this  rival's affections were transferred to another woman. She guessed that  his suspicions of La Valliere were aroused, and that, in order to leave  himself time for his convictions to undergo a change, so as not to ruin  Louise utterly, he was determined to pursue a certain straightforward  line of conduct. She could read so much real greatness of character, and  such true generosity of disposition in her lover, that her heart really  warmed with affection towards him, whose passion for her was so pure and  delicate. Despite his fear of incurring her displeasure, De Guiche, by  retaining his position as a man of proud independence of feeling and  deep devotion, became almost a hero in her estimation, and reduced her  to the state of a jealous and little-minded woman. She loved him for  this so tenderly, that she could not refuse to give him a proof of her  affection.    \"See how many words we have wasted,\" she said,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#16)"],[1,"more true, I think, to-day that it  is rather the decay of the cities that seems to poison the progress and  promise of the countryside. The cinema boasts of being a substitute for  the tavern, but I think it a very bad substitute. I think so quite apart  from the question about fermented liquor. Nobody enjoys cinemas more  than I, but to enjoy them a man has only to look and not even to listen,  and in a tavern he has to talk. Occasionally, I admit, he has to fight;  but he need never move at the movies. Thus in the real village inn are  the real village politics, while in the other are only the remote and  unreal metropolitan politics. And those central city politics are not  only cosmopolitan politics but corrupt politics. They corrupt everything  that they reach, and this is the real point about many perplexing  questions.    For instance, so far as I am concerned, it is the whole point about  feminism and the factory. It is very largely the point about feminism  and many other callings, apparently more cultured than the factory, such  as the law court and the political platform. When I see women so wildly  anxious to tie themselves to all this machinery of the modern city my  first feeling is not indignation, but that dark and ominous sort of pity  with which we should see a crowd rushing to embark in a leaking ship  under a lowering storm. When I see wives and mothers going in for  business government I not only regard it as a bad business but as a  bankrupt business. It seems to me very much as if the peasant women,  just before the French Revolution, had insisted on being made duchesses  or (as is quite as logical and likely) on being made dukes.    It is as if those ragged women, instead of crying out for bread, had  cried out for powder and patches. By the time they were wearing them  they would be the only people wearing them. For powder and patches soon  went out of fashion, but bread does not go out of fashion. In the same  way, if women desert the family for the factory, they may find they have  only done it for a deserted factory. It would have been very unwise of  the lower orders to claim all the privileges of the higher orders in the  last days of the French monarchy. It would have been very laborious to  learn the science of heraldry or the tables of precedence when all such  things were at once most complicated and most moribund. It would be  tiresome to be taught all those tricks just when the whole bag of tricks  was coming to an end. A French satirist might have written a fine  apologue about Jacques Bonhomme coming up to Paris in his wooden shoes  and demanding to be made Gold Stick in Waiting in the name of Liberty,  Equality, and Fraternity; but I fear the stick in waiting would be  waiting still.    One of the first topics on which I heard conversation turning in America  was that of a very interesting book called _Main Street_, which involves  many of these questions of the modern industrial and the eternal  feminine. It is simply the story, or perhaps rather the study than the  story, of a young married woman in one of the multitudinous little towns  on the great central plains of America; and of a sort of struggle  between her own more restless culture and the provincial prosperity of  her neighbours. There are a number of true and telling suggestions in  the book, but the one touch which I found tingling in the memory of many  readers was the last sentence, in which the master of the house, with  unshaken simplicity, merely asks for the whereabouts of some domestic  implement; I think it was a screw-driver. It seems to me a harmless  request, but from the way people talked about it one might suppose he  had asked for a screw-driver to screw down the wife in her coffin. And a  great many advanced persons would tell us that wooden house in which  she lived really was like a wooden coffin. But this appears to me to be  taking a somewhat funereal view of the life of humanity.    For, after all, on the face of it at any rate, this is merely the life  of humanity, and even the life which all humanitarians have striven to  give to humanity. Revolutionists have treated it not only as the normal  but even as the ideal. Revolutionary wars have been waged to establish  this; revolutionary heroes have fought, and revolutionary martyrs have  died, only to build such a wooden house for such a worthy family. Men  have taken the sword and perished by the sword in order that the poor  gentleman might have liberty to look for his screw-driver. For there is  here a fact about America that is almost entirely unknown in England.  The English have not in the least realised the real strength of America.  We in England hear a great deal, we hear far too much, about the  economic energy of industrial America, about the money of Mr. Morgan, or  the machinery of Mr. Edison. We never realise that while we in England  suffer from the same sort of successes in capitalism and clockwork, we  have not got what the Americans have got; something at least to balance  it in the way of a free agriculture, a vast field of free farms dotted  with small freeholders. For the reason I shall mention in a moment, they  are not perhaps in the fullest and finest sense a peasantry. But they  are in the practical and political sense a pure peasantry, in that their  comparative equality is a true counterweight to the toppling injustice  of the towns.    And, even in places like that described as Main Street, that comparative  equality can immediately be felt. The men may be provincials, but they  are certainly citizens; they consult on a common basis. And I repeat  that in this, after all, they do achieve what many prophets and  righteous men have died to achieve. This plain village, fairly  prosperous, fairly equal, untaxed by tyrants and untroubled by wars, is  after all the place which reformers have regarded as their aim; whenever  reformers have used their wits sufficiently to have any aim. The march  to Utopia, the march to the Earthly Paradise, the march to the New  Jerusalem, has been very largely the march to Main Street. And the  latest modern sensation is a book written to show how wretched it is to  live there.    All this is true, and I think the lady might be more contented in her  coffin, which is more comfortably furnished than most of the coffins  where her fellow creatures live. Nevertheless, there is an answer to  this, or at least a modification of it. There is a case for the lady and  a case against the gentleman and the screw-driver. And when we have  noted what it really is, we have noted the real disadvantage in a  situation like that of modern America, and especially the Middle West.  And with that we come back to the truth with which I started this  speculation; the truth that few have yet realised, but of which I, for  one, am more and more convinced--that industrialism is spreading because  it is decaying; that only the dust and ashes of its dissolution are  choking up the growth of natural things everywhere and turning the green  world grey.    In this relative agricultural equality the Americans of the Middle West  are far in advance of the English of the twentieth century. It is not  their fault if they are still some centuries behind the English of the  twelfth century. But the defect by which they fall short of being a true  peasantry is that they do not produce their own spiritual food, in the  same sense as their own material food. They do not, like some  peasantries, create other kinds of culture besides the kind called  agriculture. Their culture comes from the great cities; and that is  where all the evil comes from.    If a man had gone across England in the Middle Ages, or even across  Europe in more recent times, he would have found a culture which showed  its vitality by its variety. We know the adventures of the three  brothers in the old fairy tales who passed across the endless plain from  city to city, and found one kingdom ruled by a wizard and another wasted  by a dragon, one people living in castles of crystal and another sitting  by fountains of wine. These are but legendary enlargements of the real  adventures of a traveller passing from one patch of peasantry to  another, and finding women wearing strange head-dresses and men singing  new songs.    A traveller in America would be somewhat surprised if he found the  people in the city of St. Louis all wearing crowns and crusading armour  in honour of their patron saint. He might even feel some faint surprise  if he found all the citizens of Philadelphia clad in a composite  costume, combining that of a Quaker with that of a Red Indian, in honour  of the noble treaty of William Penn. Yet these are the sort of local and  traditional things that would really be found giving variety to the  valleys of mediaeval Europe. I myself felt a perfectly genuine and  generous exhilaration of freedom and fresh enterprise in new places like  Oklahoma. But you would hardly find in Oklahoma what was found in  Oberammergau. What goes to Oklahoma is not the peasant play, but the  cinema. And the objection to the cinema is not so much that it goes to  Oklahoma as that it does not come from Oklahoma. In other words, these  people have on the economic side a much closer approach than we have to  economic freedom. It is not for us, who have allowed our land to be  stolen by squires and then vulgarised by sham squires, to sneer at such  colonists as merely crude and prosaic. They at least have really kept  something of the simplicity and, therefore, the dignity of democracy;  and that democracy may yet save their country even from the calamities  of wealth and science.    But, while these farmers do not need to become industrial in order to  become industrious, they do tend to become industrial in so far as they  become intellectual. Their culture, and to some great extent their  creed, do come along the railroads from the great modern urban centres,"]]]
