[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#16)"],[1,"personal  preference is for retreat when it is a question of unpleasantness  with a stranger. And, in any case, even when warring among  themselves, the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks  of hand-to-hand fighting. Their chosen method of battling is to lie  down on the ground and shoot. This is more suited to their  physique, which is rarely great. The gangsman, as a rule, is  stunted and slight of build.    The Kid's rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of  confusion. There was no doubt that much had been hoped for from  speedy attack. Also, the generalship of the expedition had been in  the hands of the fallen warrior. His removal from the sphere of  active influence had left the party without a head. And, to add to  their discomfiture, they could not account for the Kid. Psmith they  knew, and Billy Windsor they knew, but who was this stranger with  the square shoulders and the upper-cut that landed like a  cannon-ball? Something approaching a panic prevailed among the  gang.    It was not lessened by the behaviour of the intended victims. Billy  Windsor, armed with the big stick which he had bought after the  visit of Mr. Parker, was the first to join issue. He had been a few  paces behind the others during the black-jack incident; but, dark  as it was, he had seen enough to show him that the occasion was, as  Psmith would have said, one for the Shrewd Blow rather than the  Prolonged Parley. With a whoop of the purest Wyoming brand, he  sprang forward into the confused mass of the enemy. A moment later  Psmith and the Kid followed, and there raged over the body of the  fallen leader a battle of Homeric type.    It was not a long affair. The rules and conditions governing the  encounter offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang. Like  artists who feel themselves trammelled by distasteful conventions,  they were damped and could not do themselves justice. Their forte  was long-range fighting with pistols. With that they felt _en  rapport_. But this vulgar brawling in the darkness with muscular  opponents who hit hard and often with sticks and hands was  distasteful to them. They could not develop any enthusiasm for it.  They carried pistols, but it was too dark and the combatants were  too entangled to allow them to use these. Besides, this was not the  dear, homely old Bowery, where a gentleman may fire a pistol  without exciting vulgar comment. It was up-town, where curious  crowds might collect at the first shot.    There was but one thing to be done. Reluctant as they might be to  abandon their fallen leader, they must tear themselves away.  Already they were suffering grievously from the stick, the  black-jack, and the lightning blows of the Kid. For a moment they  hung, wavering; then stampeded in half a dozen different  directions, melting into the night whence they had come.    Billy, full of zeal, pursued one fugitive some fifty yards down the  street, but his quarry, exhibiting a rare turn of speed, easily  outstripped him.    He came back, panting, to find Psmith and the Kid examining the  fallen leader of the departed ones with the aid of a match, which  went out just as Billy arrived.    \"It is our friend of the earlier part of the evening, Comrade  Windsor,\" said Psmith. \"The merchant with whom we hob-nobbed on our  way to the Highfield. In a moment of imprudence I mentioned _Cosy  Moments_. I fancy that this was his first intimation that we were in  the offing. His visit to the Highfield was paid, I think, purely  from sport-loving motives. He was not on our trail. He came merely  to see if Comrade Brady was proficient with his hands. Subsequent  events must have justified our fighting editor in his eyes. It seems  to be a moot point whether he will ever recover consciousness.\"    \"Mighty good thing if he doesn't,\" said Billy uncharitably.    \"From one point of view, Comrade Windsor, yes. Such an event would  undoubtedly be an excellent thing for the public good. But from our  point of view, it would be as well if he were to sit up and take  notice. We could ascertain from him who he is and which particular  collection of horny-handeds he represents. Light another match,  Comrade Brady.\"    The Kid did so. The head of it fell off and dropped upon the  up-turned face. The hooligan stirred, shook himself, sat up, and  began to mutter something in a foggy voice.    \"He's still woozy,\" said the Kid.    \"Still--what exactly, Comrade Brady?\"    \"In the air,\" explained the Kid. \"Bats in the belfry. Dizzy. See  what I mean? It's often like that when a feller puts one in with a  bit of weight behind it just where that one landed. Gum! I  remember when I fought Martin Kelly; I was only starting to learn  the game then. Martin and me was mixing it good and hard all over  the ring, when suddenly he puts over a stiff one right on the  point. What do you think I done? Fall down and take the count? Not  on your life. I just turns round and walks straight out of the  ring to my dressing-room. Willie Harvey, who was seconding me,  comes tearing in after me, and finds me getting into my clothes.  'What's doing, Kid?' he asks. 'I'm going fishin', Willie,' I says.  'It's a lovely day.' 'You've lost the fight,' he says. 'Fight?'  says I. 'What fight?' See what I mean? I hadn't a notion of what  had happened. It was a half an hour and more before I could  remember a thing.\"    During this reminiscence, the man on the ground had contrived to  clear his mind of the mistiness induced by the Kid's upper-cut. The  first sign he showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash  for safety up the road. But he had not gone five yards when he sat  down limply.    The Kid was inspired to further reminiscence. \"Guess he's feeling  pretty poor,\" he said. \"It's no good him trying to run for a while  after he's put his chin in the way of a real live one. I remember  when Joe Peterson put me out, way back when I was new to the  game--it was the same year I fought Martin Kelly. He had an awful  punch, had old Joe, and he put me down and out in the eighth round.  After the fight they found me on the fire-escape outside my  dressing-room. 'Come in, Kid,' says they. 'It's all right, chaps,'  I says, 'I'm dying.' Like that. 'It's all right, chaps, I'm dying.'  Same with this guy. See what I mean?\"    They formed a group about the fallen black-jack expert.    \"Pardon us,\" said Psmith courteously, \"for breaking in upon your  reverie; but, if you could spare us a moment of your valuable time,  there are one or two things which we should like to know.\"    \"Sure thing,\" agreed the Kid.    \"In the first place,\" continued Psmith, \"would it be betraying  professional secrets if you told us which particular bevy of  energetic sandbaggers it is to which you are attached?\"    \"Gent,\" explained the Kid, \"wants to know what's your gang.\"    The man on the ground muttered something that to Psmith and Billy  was unintelligible.    \"It would be a charity,\" said the former, \"if some philanthropist  would give this blighter elocution lessons. Can you interpret,  Comrade Brady?\"    \"Says it's the Three Points,\" said the Kid.    \"The Three Points? Let me see, is that Dude Dawson, Comrade  Windsor, or the other gentleman?\"    \"It's Spider Reilly. Dude Dawson runs the Table Hill crowd.\"    \"Perhaps this _is_ Spider Reilly?\"    \"Nope,\" said the Kid. \"I know the Spider. This ain't him. This is  some other mutt.\"    \"Which other mutt in particular?\" asked Psmith. \"Try and find out,  Comrade Brady. You seem to be able to understand what he says. To  me, personally, his remarks sound like the output of a gramophone  with a hot potato in its mouth.\"    \"Says he's Jack Repetto,\" announced the interpreter.    There was another interruption at this moment. The bashful Mr.  Repetto, plainly a man who was not happy in the society of  strangers, made another attempt to withdraw. Reaching out a pair of  lean hands, he pulled the Kid's legs from under him with a swift  jerk, and, wriggling to his feet, started off again down the road.  Once more, however, desire outran performance. He got as far as the  nearest street-lamp, but no farther. The giddiness seemed to  overcome him again, for he grasped the lamp-post, and, sliding  slowly to the ground, sat there motionless.    The Kid, whose fall had jolted and bruised him, was inclined to be  wrathful and vindictive. He was the first of the three to reach  the elusive Mr. Repetto, and if that worthy had happened to be  standing instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him. But  the Kid was not the man to attack a fallen foe. He contented  himself with brushing the dust off his person and addressing a  richly abusive flow of remarks to Mr. Repetto.    Under the rays of the lamp it was possible to discern more closely  the features of the black-jack exponent. There was a subtle but  noticeable resemblance to those of Mr. Bat Jarvis. Apparently the  latter's oiled forelock, worn low over the forehead, was more a  concession to the general fashion prevailing in gang circles than  an expression of personal taste. Mr. Repetto had it, too. In his  case it was almost white, for the fallen warrior was an albino. His  eyes, which were closed, had white lashes and were set as near  together as Nature had been able to manage without actually running  them into one another. His under-lip protruded and drooped. Looking  at him, one felt instinctively that no judging committee of a  beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him.    It soon became apparent that the light of the lamp, though  bestowing the doubtful privilege of a clearer view of Mr. Repetto's  face, held certain disadvantages. Scarcely had the staff of _Cosy  Moments_ reached the faint yellow pool of light, in the centre of  which Mr. Repetto reclined, than, with a suddenness which caused  them to leap into the air, there sounded from the darkness down the  road the _crack-crack-crack_ of a revolver.

S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800 ft., February 29,  1952, weight, 45.1 gms.; [Female] 31090 from 36 mi. S, 15 mi. E  Boquillas, 2550 ft., March 12, 1952; sex ? 30233 from 1 mi. N San  Lorenzo, 4200 ft., February 5, 1951; and [Female] 32098 from 7 mi. S, 4  mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June 25, 1952.    Miller (1931:66) suggested that _L. l. mexicanus_ and _L. l.  excubitorides_ intergrade in Coahuila; all of the specimens of  Loggerhead Shrike from Coahuila that I have examined are intergrades  between _mexicanus_ and _excubitorides_. Our four specimens have a  superciliary line that is indistinct and the black mask of each extends  somewhat posterior to the auricular region. The anterior part of their  forehead is somewhat lighter than the remaining part of their head and  back.    Miller (1955a:171) detected _L. l. mexicanus_ only once in catclaw  scrub in the lower part of Boquillas wash at about 4600 feet in the  Sierra del Carmen. He (_loc. cit._) remarked that his individual may  best be considered an intergrade between _mexicanus_ and  _excubitorides_, being \"somewhat closer to the former.\" Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:201) obtained a male _L. l. mexicanus_ \"in the open valley  just below the summit of Diamante Pass on April 23\" that was typical of  this subspecies. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:201-202) suggested that _L.  l. mexicanus_ breeds in southeastern Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:39) took a typical representative _L. l. mexicanus_ at Mayran on  January 30.    _Lanius ludovicianus gambeli_ Ridgway.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:214) recorded this subspecies from Hipolito on November 6.    *_Vireo atricapilla_ Woodhouse.--_Specimens examined:_ total 4: sex ?  32099-32100 from Sierra del Pino (=6 mi. N, 6 mi. W Acebuches), 5250  ft., July 3, 1952; and [Male] [Male] 31493-31494 from 16 mi. E, 18 mi.  N Ocampo, May 8 and 9, 1954, enlarged testes.    The Black-capped Vireo seems to breed as far south as central Coahuila.  Miller (1955a:171-172) reported this vireo as a summer resident in \"the  low catclaw-dominated scrub in the lower washes of Boquillas Canyon and  its side valleys, at 4600 to 4800 feet\" in the Sierra del Carmen.  Dickerman found the Black-capped Vireo common on the dry scrub and oak  hillside habitat 16 mi. E and 18 mi. N Ocampo.    _Vireo griseus noveboracensis_ (Gmelin).--Ridgway (1904:184) recorded  this subspecies of the White-eyed Vireo \"west to Sabinas.\" Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:220) also recorded _V. g.  noveboracensis_ from Sabinas on May 25. I suspect that the specimen of  _V. g. noveboracensis_ from Sabinas that was taken on May 25 was a  vagrant. _V. g. noveboracensis_ may occur in Coahuila as a migrant or  winter visitant; however, I do not believe that representatives of  _noveboracensis_ normally are resident in Coahuila.    *_Vireo griseus micrus_ Nelson.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  32101, from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952, measurements:  wing, 58 mm.; tail, 43.5 mm.; culmen, 10 mm.; tarsus, 19 mm.    This subspecies of the White-eyed Vireo breeds in Coahuila. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:221) recorded _V. g. micrus_ from  Sabinas on March 9 and May 14. The enlarged testes (5x3 mm.) of No.  32101 and the date (June 20) on which it was obtained suggest breeding  in Coahuila.    _Vireo huttoni stephensi_ Brewster.--This subspecies of Hutton's Vireo  occurs in southeastern Coahuila as a migrant. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:39) found _V. h. stephensi_ fairly common at Diamante Pass on  March 6. Ridgway (1904:198) recorded _V. h. stephensi_ from Sierra  Guadalupe in April.    *_Vireo huttoni carolinae_ Brandt.--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Male] 31588 from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6500 ft., April 5, 1954, weight, 11  gms.; [Female] 32851 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, July 6,  1955, weight, 14.2 gms.; and [Female] 32102 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella  Union, 7200 ft., June 25, 1952.    To my knowledge, _V. h. carolinae_ is the only resident subspecies of  Hutton's Vireo in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:202) found _V. h.  carolinae_ in rather limited numbers in the woods bordering the summit  of Diamante Pass. Miller (1955a:172) remarked that the subspecies  _carolinae_ was a common bird from 6500 feet to 8000 feet in the Sierra  del Carmen. Miller (_loc. cit._) took a female on April 12 that was  nearly ready to lay and said that his specimens of _carolinae_ from the  Sierra del Carmen seem to be separate from _V. h. stephensi_ and _V. h.  mexicanus_. Our specimens showed no overlapping of characters with _V.  h. stephensi_ and _V. h. mexicanus_. The size of the largest ovum (2  mm.) of No. 32102 and the dates (June 25, and July 6) on which Nos.  32102 and 32851 were obtained suggest that _V. h. carolinae_ is a  resident in Coahuila.    *_Vireo bellii medius_ Oberholser.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  31495, from San Marcos, May 5, 1954, measurements: wing, 56 mm.; tail,  48 mm.; culmen, 9.5 mm.; tarsus, 18 mm.    Although Bell's Vireo seems to have been observed uncommonly in  Coahuila, this species does breed in the State. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:202) obtained a single female _V. b. medius_ on April 20 \"in an  arroyo east of Saltillo\" and found this subspecies \"not uncommon in the  open desert twenty miles west of Saltillo, where three singing males  were secured.\" Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:226)  recorded _V. b. medius_ in breeding condition at Hipolito from June 30  to July 3. Ridgway (1904:207) recorded the subspecies from Monclova.  Hardy saw a Bell's Vireo at Parras on July 4, 1955. The size of No.  31495 is typical for _V. b. medius_.    *_Vireo flavifrons_ Vieillot.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male] 32103,  from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952.    Van Hoose (1955:302-303) suggested that the occurrence of No. 32103 in  Coahuila is evidence of a southward extension of the range of the  Yellow-throated Vireo within the last generation. The size of the  testes (5x3 mm.) of No. 32103 and the date (June 20) on which it was  obtained suggest breeding by _Vireo flavifrons_ in Coahuila.    _Vireo solitarius solitarius_ (Wilson).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31640, from 9 mi. E Hermanas (=Canyon de Parajos in the Sierra  de Parajos Azule), 2100 ft., December 7, 1953.    This subspecies of the Solitary Vireo is an uncommon migrant or winter  visitant to Coahuila. Dickerman obtained No. 31540, whose skull was  unossified and whose ovary was small, in an oak and palm habitat. The  bright yellow flanks, large and yellow wing bars, and the uniform olive  green back indicate that this specimen is a typical representative of  _V. s. solitarius_. This subspecies was previously unrecorded in  Coahuila.    _Vireo solitarius cassinii_ Xantus.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Female] 35408 (skeleton only) from 5 mi. W, 3 mi. S Acebuches, 6200  ft., May 12, 1954; and [Male] 31589 from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6200 ft.,  April 4, 1954, measurements: wing, 75 mm.; tail, 57 mm.; culmen, 10.5  mm.; weight, 14 gms.    This subspecies of the Solitary Vireo seems to be uncommon in Coahuila.  No. 31589 provides the first record of _V. s. cassinii_ in Coahuila.  Van Hoose has (1955:303) erroneously reported that Dickerman obtained  No. 31589 on July 4, 1954; the correct date is April 4, 1954.    Although the size of No. 31589 is large for _V. s. cassinii_, the color  (sides and flanks with less yellow, more olive; narrow white wing bars)  resembles that of typical representatives of _cassinii_. The testes of  No. 31589 were not enlarged. Dickerman suggested that the female from 5  mi. W and 3 mi. S Acebuches showed some resemblance to _V. s.  plumbeus_. This is not to be unexpected since the subspecies _plumbeus_  has been reported from the Chisos Mountains of Texas (Van Tyne and  Sutton, 1937:82) and from northern Chihuahua (Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore, 1957:227).    *_Vireo olivaceus_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male] 32104,  from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19, 1952.    The Red-eyed Vireo has been uncommonly reported from eastern Coahuila.  Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:229) recorded _V.  olivaceus_ from Sabinas on May 22 and from Las Vacas Creek on June 7 as  late spring migrants. Hellmayr (1935:131) listed the Red-eyed Vireo  from northern Coahuila. Findley saw a Red-eyed Vireo 2 mi. W Jimenez on  June 19, 1952. The size of the testes (5x3 mm.) of No. 32104 and the  date (June 19) on which it was obtained indicate that the Red-eyed  Vireo possibly breeds in northeastern Coahuila; if so, this is the  first breeding record of the Red-eyed Vireo in Coahuila.    _Vireo gilvus gilvus_ (Vieillot).--This subspecies of the Warbling  Vireo is an uncommon migrant in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:232) recorded _V. g. gilvus_ from 12 mi. W Saltillo on  September 28.    _Mniotilta varia_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male] 31662,  from the north slope of Sierra Guadalupe (=11 mi. S, 7 mi. W General  Cepeda), 7800 ft., April 20, 1953, weight, 10 gms., testes not  enlarged.    The Black and"]]]
