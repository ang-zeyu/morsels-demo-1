Nothing is so pitiful as the evidences of a  strong individuality crushed out by an artificial educational system  which makes the system itself of paramount importance and the individual  of microbic significance.    The signs of individuality may be observed in little folks at a very  early age. With some children they are not very pronounced, and the  child seems like hundreds of others without any particular inclination,  artistic or otherwise. It is then that the teacher's powers of  divination should be brought into play. Before any real progress can be  made the nature of the child must be studied carefully. In the case of  other children, the individuality is very marked at an early age. As a  rule, the child with the marked individuality is the one from whom the  most may be expected later in life. Sometimes this very individuality is  mistaken for precocity. This is particularly the case with musicians. In  a few instances the individuality of the master has been developed late  in life, as was the case of Richard Wagner, whose early individual  tendencies were toward the drama rather than music.      NEW PROBLEMS AT EVERY STEP    The teacher in accepting a new pupil should realize that there at once  arises new problems at every step. The pupil's hand, mind, body and soul  may be in reality different from those of every other pupil the teacher  has taught. The individual peculiarities of the hand should be carefully  considered. If the hand has long, tapering fingers, with the fingers  widely separated, it will need quite different treatment from that of  the pupil with a short, compact, muscular hand. If the pupil's mind  indicates mental lethargy or a lack of the proper early educational  training, this must be carefully considered by the teacher.    If the pupil's body is frail and the health uncertain, surely the  teacher will not think of prescribing the same work she would prescribe  for a robust, energetic pupil who appears never to have had a sick day.  One pupil might be able to practice comfortably for four and five hours  a day, while another would find her energy and interest exhausted in two  hours. In fact, I would consider the study of individuality the  principal care or study of the teacher.    The individuality of different virtuoso performers is very marked.  Although the virtuoso aspires to encompass all styles--that is, to be  what you would call an \"all-around\" player--it is, nevertheless, the  individuality of the player that adds the additional charm to the  piano-recital. You hear a great masterpiece executed by one virtuoso,  and when you hear the same composition played by another you will detect  a difference, not of technical ability or of artistic comprehension, but  rather of individuality. Rembrandt, Rubens and Vandyke might have all  painted from the same model, but the finished portrait would have been  different, and that difference would have been a reflection of the  individuality of the artist.      THE TEACHER'S RESPONSIBILITY    Again let me emphasize the necessity for the correct \"diagnosis\" of the  pupil's individuality upon the part of the teacher. Unless the right  work is prescribed by the teacher, the pupil will rarely ever survive  artistically. It is much the same as with the doctor. If the doctor  gives the wrong medicine and the patient dies, surely the doctor is to  blame. It makes no difference whether the doctor had good intentions or  not. The patient is dead and that is the end of all. I have little  patience with these people who have such wonderful intentions, but who  have neither the ability, courage nor willingness to carry out these  intentions. Many teachers would like to accomplish a very great deal for  their pupils, but alas! they are either not able or they neglect those  very things which make the teacher's work a mission. One of the  teacher's greatest responsibilities lies in determining at first upon a  rational educational course by divining the pupil's individuality.  Remember that pupils are not all like sheep to be shorn in the same  identical fashion with the same identical shears.      EDWARD MACDOWELL'S INDIVIDUALITY    One of the most remarkable cases of a pronounced musical individuality  was that of the late Edward MacDowell, who came to me for instruction  for a considerable time. He was then quite youthful, and his motives  from the very first were of the highest and noblest. His ideals were so  lofty that he required little stimulation or urging of any kind. Here it  was necessary to study the pupil's nature very carefully, and provide  work that would develop his keenly artistic individuality. I remember  that he was extremely fond of Grieg, and the marked and original  character of the Norwegian tone-poet made a deep impression upon him. He  was poetical, and loved to study and read poetry. To have repressed  MacDowell in a harsh or didactic manner would have been to have  demolished those very characteristics which, in later years, developed  in such astonishing fashion that his compositions have a distinctiveness  and a style all their own.    It gives me great pleasure to place his compositions upon my programs  abroad, and I find that they are keenly appreciated by music lovers in  the old world. If MacDowell had not had a strong individuality, and if  he had not permitted this individuality to be developed along normal  lines, his compositions would not be the treasures to our art that they  are.      DEVELOPING INDIVIDUALITY THROUGH POETRY    If the teacher discovers a pupil with apparent musical talent, but whose  nature has not been developed to appreciate the beautiful and romantic  in this wonderful world of ours, he will find it quite impossible to  alter the pupil's individuality in this respect by work at the keyboard  alone. The mundane, prosaic individual who believes that the sole aim of  musical study is the acquisition of technic, or the magic of digital  speed, must be brought to realize that this is a fault of individuality  which will mar his entire career unless it is intelligently corrected.  Years and years spent in practice will not make either a musician or a  virtuoso out of one who can conceive of nothing more than how many times  he can play a series of notes within the beats of the metronome, beating  208 times a minute.    Speed does not constitute virtuosity, nor does the ability to unravel  the somewhat intricate keyboard puzzles of Bach and Brahms make in  itself fine piano playing. The mind of the artist must be cultured; in  fact, quite as cultured as that of the composer who conceived the music.  Culture comes from the observation of many things: Nature, architecture,  science, machinery, sculpture, history, men and women, and poetry. I  advise aspiring music students to read a great deal of poetry.    I find great inspiration in Shakespeare, inspiration which I know is  communicated to my interpretations of musical masterpieces at my  concerts. Who can remain unmoved by the mystery and psychology of  _Hamlet_, the keen suffering and misery of _King Lear_, the bitter hate  and revenge of _Othello_, the sweet devotion of _Romeo and Juliet_, the  majesty of _Richard III_, and the fairy beauty of _A Midsummer Night's  Dream_? In this wonderful kaleidoscope of all the human passions one can  find a world of inspiration. I am also intensely fond of Goethe, Heine,  and Alfred de Musset. It gives me pleasure to compare them to the great  masters of music. Shakespeare I compare to Brahms, Goethe to Bach and  Beethoven, and Heine and Musset to Chopin and Liszt.      CULTIVATING VIVACITY AND BRILLIANCY    Vivacity and brilliancy in playing are largely matters of temperament  and a fluent technic. I owe a great deal in this respect to Gottschalk.  When he came back to America fresh from the hands of the inimitable  Chopin, he took the most minute pains to cultivate this characteristic  in my playing. Chopin's own playing was marked by delicacy and an  intensity that was apart from the bravura playing of most of the artists  of his time. Gottschalk was a keen observer, and he did everything  possible to impart this style to me. I have used the studies of Czerny,  Liszt, Henselt and Clementi to develop brilliancy with pupils.    It should be remembered that the root of all brilliant playing lies in  one thing--accuracy. Without accuracy any attempt at brilliancy must  result in \"mussiness.\" It is impossible to explain these things by means  of books and theories. Remember what Goethe says: \"Alle Theorie is grau,  mein Freund\" (all theory is foggy or hard to comprehend). One can say  fifty times as much in twenty minutes as one can put in a book. Books  are necessary, but by no means depend entirely upon books for technical  instruction.    Individuals who are careless possess a trait that will seriously mar  their individuality as musicians and artists. Carelessness is so often  taken for \"abandon\" in playing. \"Abandon\" is something quite different  and pertains to that unconsciousness of technical effort which only  comes to the artist after years of practice. To play with \"abandon\" and  miss a few notes in this run, play a few false notes in the next, strike  the wrong bass note here and there, mumble trills and overlook the  correct phrasing entirely, with the idea that you are doing the same  thing you have seen some great virtuoso do, is simply the superlative  degree of carelessness.    To one whose individuality is marred by carelessness let me recommend  very slow playing, with the most minute attention to detail. Technically  speaking, Czerny and Bach are of great value in correcting carelessness.  In Czerny the musical structure of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#16)"],[1,"from the beginning.         Instead of suppressing the real cause of the war, it should have       been proclaimed, not only by the people, but by the President,       Congress, Cabinet, and every military commander. Instead of       President Lincoln's waiting two long years before calling to the       side of the Government the four millions of allies whom we have       had within the territory of rebeldom, it should have been the       first decree he sent forth. Every hour's delay, every life       sacrificed up to the proclamation that called the slave to       freedom and to arms, was nothing less than downright murder by       the Government. For by all the laws of common-sense--to say       nothing of laws military or national--if the President, as       Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, could have devised any       possible means whereby he might hope to suppress the rebellion,       without the sacrifice of the life of one loyal citizen, without       the sacrifice of one dollar of the loyal North, it was clearly       his duty to have done so. Every interest of the insurgents, every       dollar of their property, every institution, however peculiar,       every life in every rebel State, even, if necessary, should have       been sacrificed, before one dollar or one man should have been       drawn from the free States. How much more, then, was it the       President's duty to confer freedom on the four million slaves,       transform them into a peaceful army for the Union, cripple the       rebellion, and establish justice, the only sure foundation of       peace! I therefore hail the day when the Government shall       recognize that it is a war for freedom. We talk about returning       to the old Union--\"the Union as it was,\" and \"the Constitution as       it is\"--about \"restoring our country to peace and prosperity--to       the blessed conditions that existed before the war!\" I ask you       what sort of peace, what sort of prosperity, have we had? Since       the first slave-ship sailed up the James River with its human       cargo, and there, on the soil of the _Old_ Dominion, sold it to       the highest bidder, we have had nothing but war. When that pirate       captain landed on the shores of Africa, and there kidnapped the       first stalwart negro, and fastened the first manacle, the       struggle between that captain and that negro was the commencement       of the terrible war in the midst of which we are to-day. Between       the slave and the master there has been war, and war only. This       is only a new form of it. No, no; we ask for no return to the       _old_ conditions. We ask for something better. We want a Union       that is a Union in fact, a Union in spirit, not a sham.       (Applause).         By the Constitution as it is, the North has stood pledged to       protect slavery in the States where it existed. We have been       bound, in case of insurrections, to go to the aid, not of those       struggling for liberty, but of the oppressors. It was politicians       who made this pledge at the beginning, and who have renewed it       from year to year to this day. These same men have had control of       the churches, the Sabbath-schools, and all religious influences;       and the women have been a party in complicity with slavery. They       have made the large majority in all the different religious       organizations throughout the country, and have without protest,       fellowshiped the slave-holder as a Christian; accepted       pro-slavery preaching from their pulpits; suffered the words       \"slavery a crime\" to be expurgated from all the lessons taught       their children, in defiance of the Golden Rule, \"Do unto others       as you would that others should do unto you.\" They have had no       right to vote in their churches, and, like slaves, have meekly       accepted whatever morals and religion the selfish interest of       politics and trade dictated.         Woman must now assume her God-given responsibilities, and make       herself what she is clearly designed to be, the educator of the       race. Let her no longer be the mere reflector, the echo of the       worldly pride and ambition of man. (Applause). Had the women of       the North studied to know and to teach their sons the law of       justice to the black man, regardless of the frown or the smile of       pro-slavery priest and politician, they would not now be called       upon to offer the loved of their households to the bloody Moloch       of war. And now, women of the North, I ask you to rise up with       earnest, honest purpose, and go forward in the way of right,       fearlessly, as independent human beings, responsible to God alone       for the discharge of every duty, for the faithful use of every       gift, the good Father has given you. Forget conventionalisms;       forget what the world will say, whether you are in your place or       out of your place; think your best thoughts, speak your best       words, do your best works, looking to your own conscience for       approval.         Mrs. HOYT, of Wisconsin: Thus far this meeting has been conducted       in such a way as would lead one to suppose that it was an       anti-slavery convention. There are ladies here who have come       hundreds of miles to attend a business meeting of the Loyal Women       of the North; and good as anti-slavery conventions are, and       anti-slavery speeches are, in their way, I think that here we       should attend to our own business.         Mrs. CHALKSTONE, of California: My speech shall be as brief as       possible and I ask for an excuse for my broken language. Our       field is very small, and God has given us character and abilities       to follow it out. We do not need to stand at the ballot-boxes and       cast our votes, neither to stand and plead as lawyers; but in our       homes we have a great office. I consider women a great deal       superior to men. (Laughter and applause). Men are physically       strong, but women are morally better. I speak of pure women, good       women. It is woman who keeps the world in the balance.         I am from Germany, where my brothers all fought against the       Government and tried to make us free, but were unsuccessful. My       only son, seventeen years old, is in our great and noble army of       the Union. He has fought in many of the battles here, and I only       came from California to see him once more. I have not seen him       yet; though I was down in the camp, I could not get any pass. But       I am willing to lay down all this sacrifice for the cause of       liberty. We foreigners know the preciousness of that great, noble       gift a great deal better than you, because you never were in       slavery, but we are born in it. Germany pines for freedom. In       Germany we sacrificed our wealth and ornaments for it, and the       women in this country ought to do the same. We can not fight in       the battles, but we can do this, and it is all we can do. The       speaker, before me, remarked that Abraham Lincoln was two years       before he emancipated slaves. She thought it wrong. It took       eighteen hundred years in Europe to emancipate the Jews, and they       are not emancipated now. Among great and intelligent peoples like       Germany and France, until 1814 no Jew had the right to go on the       pavement; they had to go in the middle of the street, where the       horses walked! It took more than two years to emancipate the       people of the North from the idea that the negro was not a human       being, and that he had the right to be a free man. A great many       will find fault in the resolution that the negro shall be free       and equal, because our equal not every human being can be; but       free every human being has a right to be. He can only be equal in       his rights. (Applause).         Mrs. ROSE called for the reading of the resolutions, which after       a spirited discussion, all except the fifth, were unanimously       adopted.         Mrs. HOYT, of Wisconsin, said: _Mrs. President_--I object to the       passage of the fifth resolution, not because I object to the       sentiment expressed; but I do not think it is the time to bring       before this meeting, assembled for the purpose of devising the       best ways and means by which women may properly assist the       Government in its struggle against treason, anything which could       in the least prejudice the interest in this cause which is so       dear to us all. We all know that Woman's Rights as an _ism_ has       not been received with entire favor by the women of the country,       and I know that there are thousands of earnest, loyal, and able       women who will not go into any movement of this kind, if this       idea is made prominent. (Applause). I came here from Wisconsin       hoping to meet the earnest women of the country. I hoped that       nothing that would in any way damage the cause so dear to us all       would be brought forward by any of the members. I object to this,       because our object should be to maintain, as women properly may,       the integrity of our Government; to vindicate its authority; to       re-establish it upon a far more enduring basis. We can do this if       we do not involve ourselves in any purely political matter, or       any _ism_ obnoxious to the people. The one idea should be the       maintenance of the authority of the Government as it is, and the       integrity of the Republican idea. For this, women may properly       work, and I hope this resolution will not pass.         SARAH H. HALLECK, of Milton, N. Y.: I would make the suggestion       that those who approve of this resolution can afford to give way,       and allow that part of it which is objectionable to be stricken       out. The negroes have suffered more than the women, and the       women,"]]]
