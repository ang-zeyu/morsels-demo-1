I have often seen hounds roar on  an old scent as well as on a new one. These dogs have generally a  special gait, which they keep steady whether the trail is cold or  hot, and give the full cry the whole time, and also often come to a  full stop to blast away a few louder roars. These dogs dwell too long  on the scent for me. My strain of dogs will open only when they are  on a hot scent; if cold, they will cover the ground silently and  fast.    A swift dog cannot keep up the full cry, but will give a roar now and  then and not bark often as it takes a lot of wind to roar. Therefore,  a dog cannot be a flyer and a roarer in the meantime, and a deer,  fox, lynx or 'coon, chased by a fleet and silent dog as above  mentioned, will have to point at once for safety, and will have no  spare time for tricks. The lynx or 'coon will have to climb in a  hurry the first tree he finds, while with a noisy dog Mr. 'Coon will  commence with his tricks as soon as he will hear the music, and I  maintain and stand ready to prove that a silent trailer as I have  described will water more deer in five hours in this country than a  noisy one will in five days.      [Illustration: \"He Was Here a Moment Ago!\"]    THE MUSIC OF THE HOUND.    The term \"music\" as applied to the barking of trailing hunting dogs,  is to the uninitiated a gross misnomer.    \"Isn't that music grand!\" exclaimed an enthusiast afield.    \"I can hear no music for the noise those dogs are making,\" replied  the other. And so it goes.    The hound is the master orator, with a command of language that  varies from uncertainty, joy, anxiety, conviction, eagerness with  great clearness and truth. His shades of meaning are accurately  intonated and perfectly comprehendible to the well versed hunter.    The hound is looked upon with disdain by people who know not his  capabilities, and is considered in the nature of the dunce of the  tribe. Well do the well informed know that he is the most delicately  strung and the most highly emotional type we have.    Every note that he utters is an expression of emotion. Because  emotion is more susceptible to music than any other agency, his code  of expression is likened unto notes of music, and with more fidelity  than some instrumental sound producers committed in the name of  music.    A student of this pure and undefiled language says: \"Each note  represents a particular feeling, and the whole harmoniously blended,  tells a simple story in a pleasing way.\"    Now the hound takes up the cold trail. He signals his master--there  are notes of expectancy and hope in the tone. As the scent grows  warmer, his tone of hope rises. He makes a loss. Could anything  express regret and chagrin any more plainly than his doleful cry?  Back on the trail. Then joy again. Then comes the excited,  imperative, anxious yet joyous fortissimo scale running when the  quarry trees.      [Illustration: \"Here He Is!\"]    He who has not been schooled in classical music sits bored and alone  at the production of an opera, or yawns and wishes he were at home in  bed, as the vigorous long haired performer spells out his emotions on  the piano key board. So it is that one with no ear for music of the  hound is disgusted thruout the sally to the woods at night, or the  fields by day. He can dwell upon nothing save the scratches, falls  and efforts required, all of which another forgets in fixing his  attention on the action and music of the chase.    Some hounds are better singers than others, just as is the case with  people. Also he must be trained to perform pleasingly and truly. If  he is well trained and is certain in his movements it will be  reflected in his music. If he is faulty in foot and head work he will  also betray these faults in his voice. Anxious to cover his own  shortcomings, he takes to guessing and guesses wrong. He becomes a  liar, and his singing is like unto the fellow with a cracked voice  who insists on singing in the church choir, thereby annoying  everybody.    An experienced hunter can tell by the song of a hound how capable he  is, even if there were not many other ways of fixing values.    Bring up a hound under proper training methods, and he is almost  certain to prove a rare musician.    If you are not versed in music of this kind, you are unfortunate, and  should join the fox or 'coon hunters and take a course of lessons. It  is well worth while.        CHAPTER XVIII.    THE DOG ON THE TRAP LINE.    Some trappers will take issue in regard to the advantages and  disadvantages of the dog on the trap line. The subject holds  sufficient interest, however, to warrant a chapter, and if some  lonesome trappers benefit thereby, our effort shall stand justified.    Now, we will say first that there is as much or more difference in  the man who handles the dog as there is in the different breeds of  dogs. We have heard men say that they wanted no dog on the trap line  with them, and that they didn't believe that any one who did want a  dog on the trap line knew but very little about trapping at the best.    Now those are the views and ideas of some trappers, while my  experience has led me to see it otherwise. One who is so constituted  that they must give a dog the growl or perhaps a kick every time they  come in reach, will undoubtedly find a dog of but little use on the  trap line. We have known some dogs to refuse to eat, and would lay  out where they could watch in the direction in which their master had  gone and piteously howl for hours, waiting the return of the master  and friend. I have seen other dogs that would take for the barn or  any other place to get out of the way at the first sight or sound of  their master. This man's dog is usually more attached to a stranger  than to his master. The man who cannot treat his dog as a friend and  companion will have good cause to say that a dog is a nuisance on the  trap line.    I have seen men training dogs for bird hunting, who would treat the  dog most cruelly and claim that a dog could not be trained to work a  bird successfully under any other treatment. Though I have seen  others train the same breed of dogs to work a bird to perfection and  that their most harsh treatment would be a tap or two with a little  switch. I will say that one who cannot understand the wag of a dog's  tail, the wistful gaze of the eye, the quick lifting of the ears, the  cautious raising of a foot, and above all, treat his dog as a friend,  need expect his dog to be but little else than a nuisance on the trap  line.    Several years ago I had a partner who had a dog, part stag hound and  the other part just dog, I think. One day he (my partner) asked if I  would object to his bringing the dog to camp, saying that his wife  was going on a visit and he had no place to leave the dog. I told him  that if he had a good dog I would be glad to have him in camp. In a  day or two pard went home and brought in the dog. Well, when he came  the dog was following along behind his master with tail and ears  drooping, and looking as though he never heard a kind word in his  life. I asked if the animal was any good and he replied that he did  not know how good he was. I asked the name of the dog. He said, \"Oh,  I call him Pont.\" I spoke to the dog, calling him by name. He looked  at me wistfully, wagging his tail. The look that dog gave me said to  me as plainly as words that this was the first kind word he had ever  heard.    We went inside and the dog started to follow, when his master in a  harsh voice said, \"get out of here.\" I said, \"where do you expect the  dog to go?\" I then took an old coat that was in the camp, placed it  in the corner and called gently to Pont, patted the coat and told him  to lay down on the coat, which he did. I patted him saying that is a  good place for Pont, and I can see that wistful gaze the dog gave me,  now. After we had our supper I asked my partner if he wasn't going to  fix Pont some supper. \"Oh, after a while I will see if I can't find  something for him.\" I took a biscuit from the table, spread some  butter on it, called the dog to me, broke the biscuit in pieces, and  gave it to the dog from my hand; then I found an old basin that  chanced to be about the camp and fixed the dog a good supper.    After the dog had finished his supper I went to the coat in the  corner, spoke gently to Pont, patted the coat, and told him to lay  down on the coat. That was the end of that, Pont knew his place and  took it without any further trouble.    The next morning when we were about ready to start out on the trap  line I asked Pard what he intended to do with Pont. He said that he  would tie him to a tree that stood against the shanty close to the  door. We were going to take different lines of traps. I said, \"What  is the harm of Pont's going with me?\" \"All right, if you want him, I  don't want any dog with me.\" I said, Am, (that was Pard's given name,  for short) I don't believe the dog wants to go with you any more than  you want him to. Am's reply was that he guessed he would go all right  if he wanted him. I said. Am, just for shucks, say nothing to the dog  and see which one he will follow. So we stepped outside the shack and  the dog stood close to me.    I said, \"Go on Am, and we will see who the dog will follow.\" He  started off and the dog only looked at him. Am stopped and told the  dog to come on. The dog got around behind me.    Am said, \"If I wanted you to come, you would come or I would break  your neck.\" I said, \"No, Am, you won't break Pout's neck while I am  around; it would not look nice.\"    I started on my way, Pont following after I had gone a little ways. I  spoke to Pont, patting him on the head and told him what a good dog  he was. He jumped about and showed more ways than one how pleased he  was, and from that day until"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#16)"],[1,"to the wayfarers of  the desert,    Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great.

THE STAR [XLVI.]    MECCA.62 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By the STAR when it setteth,    Your compatriot erreth not, nor is he led astray,    Neither speaketh he from mere impulse.    The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him:    One terrible in power2 taught it him,    Endued with wisdom. With even balance stood he    In the highest part of the horizon:    Then came he nearer and approached,    And was at the distance of two bows, or even closer,    And he revealed to his servant what he revealed.    His heart falsified not what he saw.    What! will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw?    He had seen him also another time,    Near the Sidrah-tree, which marks the boundary.3    Near which is the garden of repose.    When the Sidrah-tree4 was covered with what covered it,5    His eye turned not aside, nor did it wander:    For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord.    Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza,6    And Manat the third idol besides?7    What? shall ye have male progeny and God female?    This were indeed an unfair partition!    These are mere names: ye and your fathers named them thus: God hath not sent  down any warranty in their regard. A mere conceit and their own impulses do  they follow. Yet hath \"the guidance\" from their Lord come to them.    Shall man have whatever he wisheth?    The future and the present are in the hand of God:    And many as are the Angels in the Heavens, their intercession shall be of no  avail8    Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept.    Verily, it is they who believe not in the life to come, who name the angels  with names of females:    But herein they have no knowledge: they follow a mere conceit; and mere  conceit can never take the place of truth.    Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth only  this present life.    This is the sum of their knowledge. Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who  erreth from his way, and He best knoweth him who hath received guidance.    And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may reward  those who do evil according to their deeds: and those who do good will He  reward with good things.    To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter faults,  verily, thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy. He well knew you when he produced  you out of the earth, and when ye were embryos in your mother's womb. Assert  not then your own purity. He best knoweth who feareth him.    Hast thou considered him who turned his back?    Who giveth little and is covetous?    Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things?    Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses?    And of Abraham faithful to his pledge?    That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another,    And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath made  efforts:    And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light:    That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense,    And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things,    And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep,    And that He causeth to die and maketh alive,    And that He hath created the sexes, male and female,    From the diffused germs of life,9    And that with Him is the second creation,    And that He enricheth and causeth to possess,    And that He is the Lord of Sirius,10    And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites,    And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor,    And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most perverse.    And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown.    So that that which covered them covered them.    Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of doubt?11    He who warneth you is one of the warners of old.    The day that must draw nigh, draweth nigh already: and yet none but God can  reveal its time.    Is it at these sayings that ye marvel?    And that ye laugh and weep not?    And that ye are triflers?    Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship.      _______________________    1 This Sura was revealed at about the time of the first emigration of  Muhammad's followers to Abyssinia, A. 5. The manner in which the Prophet  cancelled the objectionable verses 19, 20, is the strongest proof of his  sincerity (as also is the opening of Sura 1xxx.) at this period. Had he not  done so, nothing would have been easier for him than to have effected a  reconciliation with the powerful party in Mecca, who had recently compelled  his followers to emigrate.    2 The Angel Gabriel, to the meaning of whose name, as the strong one of God,  these words probably allude.    3 That is, Beyond which neither men nor angels can pass (Djelal). The  original word is also rendered, the Lote-Tree of the extremity, or of the  loftiest spot in Paradise, in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the  throne of God. Its leaves are fabled to be as numerous as the members of the  whole human family, and each leaf to bear the name of an individual. This  tree is shaken on the night of the 15th of Ramadan every year a little after  sunset, when the leaves on which are inscribed the names of those who are to  die in the ensuing year fall, either wholly withered, or with more or less  green remaining, according to the months or weeks the person has yet to live.    4 The Sidrah is a prickly plum, which is called Ber in India, the zizyphus  Jujuba of Linnæus. A decoction of the leaves is used in India to wash the  dead, on account of the sacredness of the tree.    5 Hosts of adoring angels, by which the tree was masked.    6 Al-Lat or El-Lat, probably the Alilat of Herodotus (iii. 8) was an idol at  Nakhlah, a place east of the present site of Mecca. Al-Ozza was an idol of  the Kinanah tribe; but its hereditary priests were the Banu Solaym, who were  stationed along the mercantile road to Syria in the neighbourhood of Chaibar.    7 When at the first recital of this Sura, the prophet had reached this verse,  he continued,    These are the exalted females, [or, sublime swans, i.e., mounting nearer and  nearer to God]    And truly their intercession may be expected.    These words, however, which were received by the idolaters with great  exultation, were disowned by Muhammad in the course of a few days as a  Satanic suggestion, and replaced by the text as it now stands. The  probability is that the difficulties of his position led him to attempt a  compromise of which he speedily repented. In the Suras subsequent to this  period the denunciations of idolatry become much sterner and clearer. The  authorities are given by Weil, Sprenger and Muir. See Sura [lxvii.] xvii. 74-  76.    8 Verses 26-33 are probably later than the previous part of the Sura, but  inserted with reference to it. Some (as Omar b. Muhammad and 1tq.) consider  verse 33, or (as Itq.36) verses 34-42, or (as Omar b. Muhammad) the"]]]
