As for us Jews, we ascribe no honor or power to asses, as do the  Egyptians to crocodiles and asps, when they esteem such as are seized  upon by the former, or bitten by the latter, to be happy persons, and  persons worthy of God. Asses are the same with us which they are with  other wise men, viz. creatures that bear the burdens that we lay upon  them; but if they come to our thrashing-floors and eat our corn, or do  not perform what we impose upon them, we beat them with a great many  stripes, because it is their business to minister to us in our husbandry  affairs. But this Apion of ours was either perfectly unskillful in the  composition of such fallacious discourses, or however, when he  begun [somewhat better], he was not able to persevere in what he had  undertaken, since he hath no manner of success in those reproaches he  casts upon us.    8. He adds another Grecian fable, in order to reproach us. In reply to  which, it would be enough to say, that they who presume to speak about  Divine worship ought not to be ignorant of this plain truth, that it is  a degree of less impurity to pass through temples, than to forge wicked  calumnies of its priests. Now such men as he are more zealous to justify  a sacrilegious king, than to write what is just and what is true about  us, and about our temple; for when they are desirous of gratifying  Antiochus, and of concealing that perfidiousness and sacrilege which  he was guilty of, with regard to our nation, when he wanted money, they  endeavor to disgrace us, and tell lies even relating to futurities.  Apion becomes other men's prophet upon this occasion, and says that  \"Antiochus found in our temple a bed, and a man lying upon it, with a  small table before him, full of dainties, from the [fishes of the]  sea, and the fowls of the dry land; that this man was amazed at these  dainties thus set before him; that he immediately adored the king,  upon his coming in, as hoping that he would afford him all possible  assistance; that he fell down upon his knees, and stretched out to him  his right hand, and begged to be released; and that when the king bid  him sit down, and tell him who he was, and why he dwelt there, and what  was the meaning of those various sorts of food that were set before him  the man made a lamentable complaint, and with sighs, and tears in his  eyes, gave him this account of the distress he was in; and said that he  was a Greek and that as he went over this province, in order to get his  living, he was seized upon by foreigners, on a sudden, and brought  to this temple, and shut up therein, and was seen by nobody, but was  fattened by these curious provisions thus set before him; and that truly  at the first such unexpected advantages seemed to him matter of great  joy; that after a while, they brought a suspicion him, and at length  astonishment, what their meaning should be; that at last he inquired of  the servants that came to him and was by them informed that it was in  order to the fulfilling a law of the Jews, which they must not tell him,  that he was thus fed; and that they did the same at a set time every  year: that they used to catch a Greek foreigner, and fat him thus up  every year, and then lead him to a certain wood, and kill him, and  sacrifice with their accustomed solemnities, and taste of his entrails,  and take an oath upon this sacrificing a Greek, that they would ever be  at enmity with the Greeks; and that then they threw the remaining parts  of the miserable wretch into a certain pit.\" Apion adds further, that,  \"the man said there were but a few days to come ere he was to be slain,  and implored of Antiochus that, out of the reverence he bore to the  Grecian gods, he would disappoint the snares the Jews laid for his  blood, and would deliver him from the miseries with which he was  encompassed.\" Now this is such a most tragical fable as is full of  nothing but cruelty and impudence; yet does it not excuse Antiochus of  his sacrilegious attempt, as those who write it in his vindication are  willing to suppose; for he could not presume beforehand that he should  meet with any such thing in coming to the temple, but must have found it  unexpectedly. He was therefore still an impious person, that was given  to unlawful pleasures, and had no regard to God in his actions. But [as  for Apion], he hath done whatever his extravagant love of lying hath  dictated to him, as it is most easy to discover by a consideration of  his writings; for the difference of our laws is known not to regard the  Grecians only, but they are principally opposite to the Egyptians, and  to some other nations also for while it so falls out that men of all  countries come sometimes and sojourn among us, how comes it about that  we take an oath, and conspire only against the Grecians, and that by the  effusion of their blood also? Or how is it possible that all the Jews  should get together to these sacrifices, and the entrails of one man  should be sufficient for so many thousands to taste of them, as Apion  pretends? Or why did not the king carry this man, whosoever he was, and  whatsoever was his name, [which is not set down in Apion's book,] with  great pomp back into his own country? when he might thereby have been  esteemed a religious person himself, and a mighty lover of the Greeks,  and might thereby have procured himself great assistance from all men  against that hatred the Jews bore to him. But I leave this matter;  for the proper way of confuting fools is not to use bare words, but to  appeal to the things themselves that make against them. Now, then, all  such as ever saw the construction of our temple, of what nature it was,  know well enough how the purity of it was never to be profaned; for it  had four several courts [12] encompassed with cloisters round about,  every one of which had by our law a peculiar degree of separation  from the rest. Into the first court every body was allowed to go, even  foreigners, and none but women, during their courses, were prohibited  to pass through it; all the Jews went into the second court, as well as  their wives, when they were free from all uncleanness; into the third  court went in the Jewish men, when they were clean and purified; into  the fourth went the priests, having on their sacerdotal garments; but  for the most sacred place, none went in but the high priests, clothed in  their peculiar garments. Now there is so great caution used about these  offices of religion, that the priests are appointed to go into the  temple but at certain hours; for in the morning, at the opening of the  inner temple, those that are to officiate receive the sacrifices, as  they do again at noon, till the doors are shut. Lastly, it is not so  much as lawful to carry any vessel into the holy house; nor is there any  thing therein, but the altar [of incense], the table [of shew-bread],  the censer, and the candlestick, which are all written in the law; for  there is nothing further there, nor are there any mysteries performed  that may not be spoken of; nor is there any feasting within the place.  For what I have now said is publicly known, and supported by the  testimony of the whole people, and their operations are very manifest;  for although there be four courses of the priests, and every one of them  have above five thousand men in them, yet do they officiate on certain  days only; and when those days are over, other priests succeed in the  performance of their sacrifices, and assemble together at mid-day, and  receive the keys of the temple, and the vessels by tale, without any  thing relating to food or drink being carried into the temple; nay, we  are not allowed to offer such things at the altar, excepting what is  prepared for the sacrifices.    9. What then can we say of Apion, but that he examined nothing that  concerned these things, while still he uttered incredible words about  them? but it is a great shame for a grammarian not to be able to write  true history. Now if he knew the purity of our temple, he hath entirely  omitted to take notice of it; but he forges a story about the seizing of  a Grecian, about ineffable food, and the most delicious preparation of  dainties; and pretends that strangers could go into a place whereinto  the noblest men among the Jews are not allowed to enter, unless they  be priests. This, therefore, is the utmost degree of impiety, and a  voluntary lie, in order to the delusion of those who will not examine  into the truth of matters; whereas such unspeakable mischiefs as are  above related have been occasioned by such calumnies that are raised  upon us.    10. Nay, this miracle or piety derides us further, and adds the  following pretended facts to his former fable; for he says that this man  related how, \"while the Jews were once in a long war with the Idumeans,  there came a man out of one of the cities of the Idumeans, who there had  worshipped Apollo. This man, whose name is said to have been Zabidus,  came to the Jews, and promised that he would deliver Apollo, the god of  Dora, into their hands, and that he would come to our temple, if they  would all come up with him, and bring the whole multitude of the Jews  with them; that Zabidus made him a certain wooden instrument, and put it  round about him, and set three rows of lamps therein, and walked after  such a manner, that he appeared to those that stood a great way off  him to be a kind of star, walking upon the earth; that the Jews were  terribly affrighted at so surprising an appearance, and stood very quiet  at a distance; and that Zabidus, while they continued so very quiet,  went into the holy house, and carried off that golden head of an ass,  [for so facetiously does he write,] and then went his way back again  to Dora in great haste.\" And say you so, sir! as I may reply; then  does Apion load the ass, that is, himself, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#16)"],[1,"quickly but do not scorch.    _Fig Pudding_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) One pound figs, half pound suet, six  eggs, two cups sugar, three cups biscuit crumbs. Run figs, suet and  crumbs through grinder, beat eggs very light, add other ingredients,  beat again, and steam or boil in buttered mold, tied in well scalded  bag, four hours. Serve hot with this sauce. Beat to a light cream, one  cup butter with two cups sugar. Add two eggs very well beaten, then  gradually two tablespoons vinegar and one of vanilla. Cook a long time  in double boiler, stirring constantly, or it will not be smooth. Keep  hot until served.    _Thin Ginger Snaps_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) Mix a cup of melted lard well  through two of molasses, add a pinch of salt, spices to taste, and  enough flour to make a soft batter. Drop by small spoonfuls on a  well-greased baking sheet, and cook in quick oven.    _Measure Pound Cake_: (Leslie Fox.) Cream well together, one cup butter,  one and three-quarter cups sugar, when very light, drop in an egg-yolk  unbeaten, beat hard, put in another yolk, beat again hard, then another,  and repeat the hard beating. When very light add alternately two and  one-half cups flour, and one cup milk, mix well, then add half a cup  flour sifted three times with three even teaspoonfuls baking powder.  Follow this with the egg-whites beaten stiff. Flavor with brandy--a  tablespoonful and a half. Bake in a moderate oven about an hour. Serve  with any approved pudding sauce, or use as other cake. Nearly as good as  the pound cake of our grandmothers.    _Kisses_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) Add to four fresh egg-whites unbeaten, a tiny  pinch of salt, two teaspoonfuls water, and three cups fine sugar. Beat  hard for at least half an hour--until the mixture is smooth and stiff.  Drop from point of spoon upon buttered paper, and harden in an oven cool  enough not to color.          [Illustration: _Meat, Poultry, Game, Eggs_]      _Barbecued Lamb_: The middle piece, known to butchers as \"the bracelet,\"  is best for barbecuing. Have it split down the backbone, and the  rib-ends neatly trimmed, also the ribs proper, broken about midway, but  not quite through. Wash clean, wipe dry, rub over well with salt, then  prick in tiny gashes with a sharp-pointed knife, and rub in well black  pepper, paprika, a very little dry mustard, then dash lightly with  tabasco. Put a low rack in the bottom of a deep narrowish pan, set the  meat upon it, letting only the backbone and rib-ends touch the rack.  This puts it in a sort of Gothic arch. Keep it so throughout the  cooking. Put a cupful of water underneath--it must not touch the meat.  Have the oven very hot, but not scorching--should it scorch in the least  turn another pan over the meat for the first hour of cooking. Add more  water as the first boils away, but do not baste the meat--the water is  merely to keep it from getting too hard. Roast till the fat is crisped  and brown throughout, the lean very tender. Take up on a broad, hot  dish, and in serving cut along the ribs, so as to let each portion  include the whole length of them, as well as part of the backbone. Serve  with a sauce, of melted butter, mixed with equal quantity of strong  vinegar, boiling hot, made thick with red and black pepper, minced  cucumber pickle, and a bare dash of onion juice. This is as near an  approach to a real barbecue, which is cooked over live coals in the  bottom of a trench, as a civilized kitchen can supply.    The middling of a pig weighing less than a hundred pounds, well  scraped, washed clean, and likewise roasted on a rack after seasoning it  well, makes a fine dish. The sauce for it should include minced green  peppers, instead of cucumbers. If you happen to have a pepper mango, cut  it fine, and let it stand in the hot sauce ten minutes before serving.    _Beefsteak with Bacon and Onions_: Fry crisp a pound of streaky bacon,  take up and keep warm. Make the fat bubble all over, lay in it a steak,  wiped clean, seasoned with salt and pepper, and dredged lightly with  flour. Sear it well on both sides--take from the fat, lay on broiler,  and cook for ten minutes, turning once. Serve thus if you like it  rare--if contrariwise you want it well done, set the steak on a rack or  broiler in a hot oven, and let it cook there for fifteen to twenty  minutes, according to thickness. Meantime dredge more flour into the  fat, let it brown a minute, then lay in large, mild onions thinly  sliced. Fry to a light brown, and serve around the steak. Serve the  gravy separately, adding to it just before taking up, a little hot  water, and shaking the pan well. This may be varied by frying with the  onions or instead of them, sliced tomatoes, and green peppers finely  shredded. Or cut large, very meaty tomatoes, unpeeled, into thick  slices, pour off the gravy, lay them in the hot, greasy pan, season well  with pepper and salt, and cook five minutes, turning them and seasoning  the other side. Lay the bacon on the tomatoes--otherwise put it around  the steak outside the onions.    _Boned Fresh Ham_: It had better not be too big--ten pounds is about the  limit. Have the bone removed, but do not throw it away. Instead break it  in pieces and boil them three hours in water to barely cover. Wipe the  ham well inside and out, rub the inside over lightly with butter, season  with salt and pepper, and pour in a little vinegar. Rub salt well over  the outside and let stand on ice several hours. Make a stuffing of  grated breadcrumbs, with minced pork fat, a sprig of celery chopped  fine, half an apple, also chopped fine, salt, pepper, paprika, a pinch  of sage in powder, and the least shred of thyme and lemon peel. A  chestnut stuffing can be used, or one whose foundation is grated sweet  potato. Fill the bone cavity, firmly but not too full, skewer or sew  together the cut edges, and tie around twice with narrow tape. Turn  over, score the skin well, rub it with soft butter or bacon fat, dredge  lightly with flour, then with black and red pepper, also lightly with  sugar, and lay on a low rack in a pan. Fill in sweet cider, or sound  claret till it stands halfway up to the ham, cover with a close-fitting  upper pan, and put into a hot oven. Cook for two hours, lifting the pan  now and then, and basting the meat. Uncover, and make very, very crisp.  Serve on a hot dish, with candied sweet potatoes laid around. Add  boiling water to the liquor in the pan, shake it well about, and pour  into a gravy boat. Or pour off the grease, add a sprinkle of flour, let  it brown on top the stove, and put to it the strained liquor the bone  was boiled in. Cook three minutes, and serve in the gravy boat. If the  bone liquor is not used this way, make it the foundation of pea or  cabbage soup. In carving cut through and through so as to serve the  stuffing with each portion.    _Roast Beef_: Scrape and wash clean, wipe dry, sear cut sides well,  either in bubbling fat, or under gas flame, set on a small rack in a  deep pan, sprinkle well with salt and pepper, dredge on flour scantly,  pour water underneath till it stands half an inch deep, cover close, set  in a hot oven and cook until tender. Basting will not be needed until  the pan is uncovered--then add a little more water, boiling hot, baste  thoroughly, return to oven, and brown. If you like, add sliced tomatoes,  minced onions, shredded green peppers, carrots cut small, and very  tender green peas after uncovering--they will cook while the meat is  browning, and can be served all together in a separate dish.    _Pot Roast_: Wash and dry, then brown lightly all over in hot bacon fat,  and lay upon a small rack in the bottom of a deep pot, seasoning well  with salt, pepper, and paprika. Pour on a little Cayenne, vinegar, add a  spoonful of hot fat, then pour in enough boiling water to come half way  up the meat, cover tight, and simmer until tender. An hour before  serving time, put any sort of vegetables approved, or at hand, carrots,  sliced, peas, string beans, lima beans, potatoes in thick slices, into  the browning fat, let them cook five to ten minutes, sprinkling them  well with salt and pepper, then skim out of the fat, and add to the pot,  along with a cupful more boiling water. Simmer until the water is all  gone, and the meat is brown. Take up, lay vegetables around the meat, or  make a bed of them for it, add a little more hot water to the pot, stir  well over the fire till it takes up the meat essence, then pour it over  meat and vegetables, else serve in a gravy boat.    _Leg of Mutton in Blanket_: Make deep, narrow gashes in the thick end of  a clean leg of mutton, crowd into them a mixed seasoning, salt, red and  black pepper, minced onion, a little dry mustard, and powdered herbs.  Brush all over with melted butter, or soft bacon fat, then sprinkle  lightly with salt, set on a rack in a roasting pan, and pop into a very  hot oven. Let it brown--then rub over it any tart jelly melted in a  little hot water, and envelop it in a crust of flour and water, made  very stiff, and rolled half an inch thick. Pinch the edges tight  together, lay back in the pan, cover it, and bake in a hot oven. Take  up, break the blanket carefully on top, lift out the meat, and pour the  gravy from the envelop into a small sauce pan, add to it either hot  claret, or a spoonful of tart jelly, along with tabasco or Worcester  sauce, boil up, and serve in a boat. Tomato or walnut catsup may be used  for flavoring. Indeed one sometimes finds opportunity a close second to  inspiration.    _The Preparation of Poultry and Game_: Pick carefully, draw and singe  every manner of poultry and feathered game, wash clean, quickly, in cold  water, never hot, drain, then wipe as dry as possible with a soft,  thick, damp cloth--it takes up moisture cleaner than a dry one. Keep  very cold and away from smells until ready to cook. Tilt roasting fowls,  so they may drain, if liquid gathers. Before stuffing rub over the  whole "]]]
