Have you the  eyes of a hunter?      TALE 51    Orion the Hunter, and His Fight With the Bull    In the 49th Tale I told you there were two giants among the mighty  hunters in the sky, Booetes, whose adventure with the Bears you have  already heard, and Orion. (O-ry'-on).    Orion was the most famous of all. In his day men had no guns; they had  nothing but clubs, spears, and arrows to fight with, and the beasts were  very big and fierce as well as plentiful, yet Orion went whenever he was  needed, armed chiefly with his club, fought the wild beasts, all alone,  killing them or driving them out, and saving the people, for the joy of  doing it. Once he killed a lion with his club, and ever afterward wore  the lion's skin on his arm. Bears were as nothing to him; he killed them  as easily as most hunters would rabbits, but he found his match, when he  went after a ferocious wild Bull as big as a young elephant.    As soon as the Bull saw him, it came rushing at him. It happened to be  on the other side of a stream, and as it plunged in, Orion drew his bow  and fired seven quick shots at the Bull's heart. But the monster was  coming head on, and the seven arrows all stuck in its shoulder, making  it madder than ever. So Orion waved his lion skin in his left hand, and  with his club in the right, ran to meet the Bull, as it was scrambling  up the bank from the water.    The first whack of the club tumbled the Bull back into the water, but it  turned aside, went to another place, and charged again. And again Orion  landed a fearful blow with the club on the monster's curly forehead.    By this time, all the animals had gathered around to see the big fight,  and the gods in heaven got so interested that they shouted out, \"Hold  on, that is good enough for us to see. Come up here.\"    So they moved the mighty Hunter and the Bull, and the River and all the  animals, up to heaven, and the fight has gone on there ever since.    In the picture I have shown a lot of animals besides Orion and the Bull,  but the only things I want you to look now in the sky, are Orion's belt  with the three stars on it, and the Pleiades on the Bull's shoulder, the  seven spots where the seven arrows struck.    And remember these stars cannot be seen in summer, they pass over us in  winter time. You can find Orion by drawing a straight line across the  rim of the Dipper, beginning at the inner or handle side, passing  through the outer or Pointers side, and continued for twice the length  of the Dipper, handle and all, this will bring you to Betelgeuze, the  big star in the Giant's right shoulder, below that are the three stars  of his belt, sometimes called the \"Three Kings.\"      TALE 52    The Pleiades, that Orion Fired at the Bull    [Illustration: The Pleiades]    When late autumn comes the Pleiades (Ply'-a-dees) appear in the evening  sky to the eastward. These are the seven shots in the Bull's shoulder,  the seven arrows from Orion's bow. The Guide can locate them by  continuing the line of Orion's belt, eight times the length of the belt  to the right, as one faces the Hunter, so Orion must have been very  close indeed. At first they look like a faint light with a few bright  pin-points scattered through. Tennyson described them as:            Glittering like a swarm of fireflies          Tangled in a silver braid.    The best time to see them is some clear night about Christmas, when  there is no moon, and the Pleiades are nearly overhead, above the mist  and smoke of the horizon, and there are no electric lights near by.    Study them attentively. Make a tube of your two hands and look through.  Look on the ground, then look back again; look not straight at them, but  a little to one side; and at last, mark down on paper how many you can  clearly see, putting a big spot for the big one, and little spots for  the little ones. Poor eyes see nothing but a haze; fairly good eyes see  four of the pin-points; good eyes see five; the best of eyes see seven.  I can see seven on a clear winter night when there are no clouds and no  moon. This is as high as you need expect to get, although it is said  that some men in clear air on a mountain top have seen ten, while the  telescope shows that there are 2,000.    In taking these eyesight tests you may use your spectacles if you  usually wear them.      TALE 53    The Twin Stars            Two-Bright-Eyes went wandering out          To chase the Whippoorwill;          Two-Bright-Eyes got lost and left          Our teepee--oh, so still!            Two-Bright-Eyes was carried up          To sparkle in the skies          And look like stars--but we know well          That that's our lost Bright-Eyes.            She is looking for the camp,          She would come back if she could;          She still peeps thro' the tree-tops          For the teepee in the wood.      TALE 54    Stoutheart and His Black Cravat    Do you know the bird that wears a black cravat, which he changes once a  year? It is the English Sparrow, the commonest of all our birds. His  hair is gray, but he must have been red-headed once, for just back of  his ears there is still a band of red; and his collar, maybe, was white  once, but it is very dingy now. His shirt and vest are gray; his coat is  brown with black streaks--a sort of sporting tweed. The new cravat comes  when the new feathers grow in late summer; and, at first, it is barred  with gray as if in half mourning for his sins. As the gray tips wear  off, it becomes solid black; that is, in March or April. In summer, it  gets rusty and worn out; so every year he puts on a new one in late  August.    The hen sparrow is quite different and wears no cravat. She has a  black-and-brown cape of the sporting pattern, but her dress is  everywhere of brownish Quaker gray.    The song of the English Sparrow is loud and short; but he tries to make  up, by singing it over and over again, for many minutes.    He eats many bad bugs, and would be well liked, if he did not steal the  nests and the food of Bluebirds, Woodpeckers, Swallows, and others that  are prettier and more useful birds, as well as far better singers than  he is.    But there is much to admire in the Sparrow. I do not know of any bird  that is braver, or more ready to find a way out of trouble; and if he  cannot find a way, he cheerfully makes the best of it.    Some years ago I was at Duluth during a bitterly cold spell of weather.  The thermometer registered 20 deg. or 30 deg. below zero, and the blizzard wind  was blowing. Oh my, it was cold. But out in the street were dozens of  English Sparrows chirruping and feeding; thriving just as they do in  warmer lands and in fine weather.    When black night came down, colder yet, I wondered what the little  stout-hearts would do. Crawl into some hole or bird-house, maybe? or  dive into a snowdrift? as many native birds do.    I found out; and the answer was most unexpected.    In front of the hotel was a long row of electric lights. At nine  o'clock, when I chanced to open the window for a breath of air, my eye  fell on these; on every bulb was an English Sparrow sound asleep with  the overarching reflector to turn the storm, and the electric bulb below  him to warm his toes. My hat is off. Our Department of Agriculture may  declare war on the Sparrow; but what is the use? Don't you think that a  creature who is not afraid of blizzard or darkness, and knows how to use  electric lights, is going to win its life-battle, and that he surely is  here to stay?      TALE 55    Tracks, and the Stories They Tell    [Illustration: Tracks, and the Stories They Tell]    Sometimes, in town, just after rain, when the gutters are wet, and the  pavement dry, look for the tracks of some Dog that walked with wet  feet on the pavement. You will find that they are like \"a\" in the  drawing. A Dog has five toes on his front feet, but only four touch the  pavement as he walks. The claws also touch, and make each a little mark.    Now look for the track of a Cat; it is somewhat like that of the Dog,  but it is smaller, softer, and the claws do not show (b). They are too  good to be wasted on a pavement; she keeps them pulled in, so they are  sharp when she has use for them.    Make a drawing of each of these, and make it life size.    When there is dust on the road, or snow, look for Sparrow tracks; they  are like \"c.\"    Note how close together the front three toes are. The inner two are  really fast together, so they cannot be separated far and the hind toe  is very large. Last of all, note that the tracks go two and two, because  the Sparrow goes \"hop hop, hop.\" These things mean that the Sparrow is  really a tree bird; and you will see that, though often on the ground he  gets up into a tree when he wishes to feel safe.    Look for some Chicken tracks in the dust; they are like \"d\" in the  drawing because the Chicken does not go \"hop, hop, hop\" like the  Sparrow, but \"walk, walk, walk.\" The Chicken is a ground bird. Most of  the song birds hop like the Sparrow, and most of the game birds walk  like a Chicken. But the Robin (e) goes sometimes hopping and sometimes  running, because part of his life is in the trees, and part on the  ground.      TALE 56    A Rabbit's Story of His Life, Written by Himself    Yes, the Rabbit wrote it himself and about himself in the oldest writing  on earth, that is the tracks of his feet.    [Illustration: A WOODCRAFT TRAGEDY    As shown by the Tracks and Signs in the Snow]    In February of 1885, one morning after a light snowfall, I went tramping  through the woods north of Toronto, when I came on something that always  makes me stop and look--the fresh tracks of an animal. This was the  track of a Cottontail Rabbit and I followed its windings with thrills of  interest.

The style  is late thirteenth century with windows of exceedingly graceful  design; double arches with quatrefoils above, united in pairs with a  large six-foiled circle in the main head. The upper portions of the  tracery had, not so long ago, traces of coloured glass here and there,  but whether this feature was part of the original scheme is very  doubtful. The shafts, originally of Purbeck marble (replaced in 1854  by stone) both between and in the centres of the windows have simply  moulded capitals; while those of the clustered columns at the main  angles are carved. Modern opinion is inclined to date the beginning of  the work between 1260 to 1284; but so late as 1338, as a dated charter  in Bishop Wyville's time which refers to the enlargement of the  cloisters shows, they were not quite completed; hence it is inferred  that a part, possibly only one side, was built at first. The north  arcade is entirely independent of the south wall of the nave, the long  space between being known as the Plumbery. The garth is used as a  burial ground, and in the cloisters are many monuments, but none of  more than local interest, except possibly a tablet to the memory of  Francis Price (died Mar. 20th, 1753, aged 50), the cathedral  architect, whose excellent monograph devoted to the building is still  one of the most useful books of reference on the subject. The drawing  here reproduced from Britton's \"Salisbury,\" shows the work before its  restoration by Bishop Denison; but it has been chosen because it  suggests the peculiar beauty of the place better than any photograph.  From the cloisters a very charming glimpse of the spire may be  obtained.       [Illustration: THE CLOISTERS.     _From a Photograph by Messrs. Poulton._]       [Illustration: THE CLOISTERS, LOOKING NORTH.]    The =Library= occupying the upper story that extends over part of the  eastern arcade is an important collection, its manuscripts alone  filling a hundred and eighty-seven volumes. These (with one  exception, bequeathed by Bishop Denison, a splendidly illuminated  breviary _circa_ A.D. 1460, containing among other specially  interesting matter the order of service for the installation of the  Boy-bishops,) have been in the possession of the dean and chapter at  least four hundred years, and range in date, according to the best  authorities, from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries.    Among the most important is (No. 150) A Psalter, of the Gallican  Version, on vellum, 160 folios, tenth century. The decorations of this  MS. are somewhat rude, the initials and colouring throughout being  chiefly in red. Internal evidence fixes its date about A.D.  969. A Psalter (No. 180) on 173 folios, contains in parallel columns  the Gallican and Hebrew of Jerome's translation, and other matter,  with ornamental initials and devices; a Lectionary on vellum, 190  folios (No. 153) is a finely written manuscript, with elaborate  initials in gold and colours, this is about A.D. 1277. A  fifteenth century \"Processional for the Use of Sarum,\" on vellum, 50  folios (No. 148) contains some entries that throw light on various  local customs, as for example, the distribution of the carpet used in  the enthronement of the bishop, which was laid from _ostio hospicii  agni_ to the altar in the treasury. The unique \"Tonale secundum usum  Sarum\" bound with an \"Ordinale secundum usum Sarum\" (No. 175) is of  the fourteenth century, on 214 folios of vellum. In a volume (No. 39)  is a copy of the Gospel of Nicodemus in an English version beginning,  \"Whanne Pylatus was reuler and justyse of ye Jewerye, and Rufus and  Leo were consuls.\" Another book of more than ordinary interest is  Chaucer's translation of Boethius' \"De Consolatione Philosophiae,\" on  vellum in double columns, fifteenth century. A twelfth century MS. of  the \"Historia Regum Brittaniae,\" by Geoffrey de Monmouth (No. 121); and  the \"Historia Miscella\" of Paul Warnefrid, are among many others that  deserve mention.    Among the printed books of the Library are about a score belonging to  the fifteenth century, and one hundred of the sixteenth. Some of these  are of extreme rarity. In a copy of Sibbes' \"Returning Backslider\" is  this couplet (attributed to Doddridge) in the handwriting, with  autograph, of Isaac Walton:        \"Of this blest man let this just praise be given,      Heaven was in him before he was in heaven.\"    Bishop Gheaste was a benefactor to the library, and left it a large  legacy, the foundation of the present collection of printed books.    The library is shown to the public on certain days, and the clergy of  the diocese have the privilege of borrowing books therefrom.    According to the \"Inventory of the Riches of the Cathedral Church of  Sarum,\" made by Master Thomas Robertson, treasurer of the same church  in 1536, 28th year of Henry VII., we find images, \"of God the Father  with our Saviour young, of silver and gilt with gold, ornate with red  stones weighing 74 ounces.\" Others of Our Lady, including a \"grate and  fair ymage sitting in a chaire ... her child sits in her lap very  costly and fair to look upon.\" Reliques of the 11,000 virgins, in four  purses; Pyxides of Ivory of Chrystal, and silver gilt, \"Cruces\" of  Gold and Silver. And a great Cross silver and gilt with images on the  crucifix, Mary and John, and the left part of the cross--weighing 180  ounces. Calices (chalices), Fereta, Candelabra, Philateria,  Tabernucla, Ampulae, Thuribula, Chrismatones, Copes and Chasubles,  Mitres, Basons, Garlands, and hangings, Morses and many other items.  Also the textus, which was given by Hubert de Burgh, here described as  \"A text after Matthew having images of St. Joseph, and our Lady and  our Saviour all in a bed of straw, in every corner is the image of an  apostle,\" and a huge list of items not merely interesting in  themselves, but as evidence of the wealth of the cathedral.       [Illustration: RINGS FOUND IN THE LADY CHAPEL.]    =The Muniment Room=, which is approached from the south choir  transept, is part of a two-storied building, octagonal in plan. The  ground floor, formerly the sacristy, is now used as a vestry for the  canons; the upper one, a dimly-lighted room, with an oak roof  supported by a central column of wood, is the muniment chamber. Traces  of a cross on the central pillar support the theory that the \"Altar in  the Treasury,\" referred to in various early documents, stood here. The  solidity and strength of the building, and the fact that it was  undoubtedly the store house for the vestments and treasures of the  church, leaves little doubt that the supposition is true.    A very fine cope chest, reproduced by Mr. William Burges in his  \"Architectural Drawings,\" 1870, until lately preserved in the vestry,  now in the north choir aisle, has a quaintly-carved capital on one of  its shafts that suggests a very early date for its construction. The  heavy lid was originally lifted by a rope and windlass. Although  possessing no traces of painting or gilding, and but little carving,  it is both curious and interesting as a specimen of woodwork coeval  with the cathedral itself. A somewhat similar one exists in  Westminster Abbey, in both the lifting lids worked on very slight  pivots. At Westminster the chains remain. In 1834 a writer described  the room as \"a feast for moths and spiders;\" now it is kept in  admirable order. The most important of its extremely valuable  documents have been printed in a volume devoted to Sarum in the  \"Master of the Rolls Series,\" in the late Canon Jones' \"Fasti  Ecclesiae: Sarisberiensis.\" In addition to these historic papers there  is an immense quantity of Chapter Registers and other MSS. of more  local interest. Many of the chests and presses date from early times,  when the three keys needed to open each were severally in the charge  of three of the cathedral dignitaries. The contemporary copy of Magna  Charta, made for William Longespee, first Earl of Salisbury, and  referred to elsewhere, is sometimes exhibited here.    The documents which contain \"the statutes and ordinances\" by which the  cathedral is governed, extend over six centuries, commencing in 1091  and ending 1697. These were edited by Dr. Edward A. Dayman, and the  late Rev. W.H. Rich Jones, Vicar of Bradford-on-Avon, whose researches  in the past history of not merely the cathedral, but the whole  district, were so extended, that it is impossible to do justice in  every instance to many facts which have been taken from his pages in  the preparation of this handbook. The privately printed volume,  published in 1883, contains the Latin text with English notes of these  various documents. The details of most of these, although of immense  value to antiquarians, are too technical to be available for quotation  here, but the indirect allusions to customs and manners of the past,  makes many a paragraph pleasant reading, although the whole document  may refer to merely the working details of administration. The  statute, dated A.D. 1319, relating to the rights of the boy  bishop, is one of the few that have more than local interest.       [Illustration: HANGING PARAPET ON THE EAST WALL OF THE CLOSE.]    =The Close= is certainly a fit setting for the jewel it surrounds, and  with full remembrance of the superb position of Durham, the  picturesque eminence of Lincoln, the dignity that marks the isolated  hill whereon Ely towers over the fens around it, the harmonious  environment of Wells, and many another site made memorable by its  cathedral, Salisbury is, in its own way, not less beautiful.
