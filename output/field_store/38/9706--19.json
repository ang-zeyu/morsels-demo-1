What are they doing?\"    \"I will tell you about it this evening, Dick, as it is rather a long  story.\"    After the Jacksons had driven off in the evening, Dick again asked his  father about the doings of Colonel Pearson's column.    \"Well, my boy, they have neither suffered a great defeat, like that  under Lord Chelmsford, nor obtained a decisive victory, like the column  of Colonel Wood; they have beaten the enemy in a fight, and are at  present besieged in a place called Ekowe, or, as it is sometimes spelt,  Etckowi.  The column consisted of eight companies of the 3rd Buffs under  Colonel Parnell; six companies of the 99th, under Colonel Welman; one  company of Royal Engineers and two 7-pounder guns; they had, besides a  naval brigade consisting of 270 bluejackets and marines of her Majesty's  ships _Active_ and _Tenedos_, with three gatling-guns, 200 mounted  infantry; 200 colonial mounted riflemen also formed part of the column,  with about 2000 men of the native contingent.  They had great difficulty  in crossing the Tugela, which was nearly 400 yards wide.  But, thanks to  the exertions of the sailors, a flying bridge was constructed--that is,  a boat with ropes attached to both shores, so that it can be pulled  backwards and forwards, or, as is sometimes done, taken backwards and  forwards by the force of the stream itself.    \"It was the 13th before the crossing was effected.  The enemy were in  considerable force near the river.  A small earthwork, called Fort  Tenedos, was thrown up on the Zulu bank of the river.  On the 18th the  leading division started on its march into the enemy's country, followed  the next day by the second division, a small detachment being left to  garrison the fort.  Every precaution was taken in the advance, and the  cavalry scouted the country in front of the column.  At the end of the  first day's march the Inyoni, a small stream ten miles north of the  Tugela, was reached.    \"The second day they encamped on the Umsindusi.  The third day's march  brought the column to the Amatikulu; beyond this the country became  covered with bush, and great care was then taken, as it was known that a  large force was marching from Ulundi to oppose their farther advance.  Early on the morning of the 22nd, the day which proved so fatal to  Colonel Glyn's column, the first division had just crossed the Inyezane  River and was halted for breakfast, when they were attacked by a large  force of the enemy, who, having chosen this position, were lying in wait  for them.  The ground chosen for the halt was not a favourable one, as  it was surrounded by bush.  But as no other place could be found by  Major Barrow, who commanded the horse, near water, the halt had been  made here.  Scarcely had they begun their preparations for breakfast,  when Captain Hart, who was out scouting in front with the advance  company of the native contingent, discovered the enemy advancing rapidly  over the ridge in his front and attempting to gain the bush on both  flanks of the halting-place.  The Zulus at once opened a heavy fire upon  the native contingent, and of these one officer and four  non-commissioned officers and three men fell almost immediately.    \"The native contingent was called in, and the naval brigade and two  guns, under Lieutenant Lloyd, and two companies of the Buffs were  ordered to take up a position upon a knoll close to the road, on which  they were halted.  The sailors at once opened fire on the enemy with two  7-pounders and two 24-pounder rocket-tubes, while the Buffs poured a  heavy fire with their rifles upon them.  The waggons were still coming  up, and these were parked as they reached the ground; and two companies  of the Buffs, who were guarding them on the march, being now free to  act, were ordered to move out in skirmishing order, and draw the enemy  out of the bush, when, as they retired, they were exposed to the fire  from the knoll.    \"The engineers and mounted troops moved forward, with the infantry  skirmishers, supported by a half-company of the Buffs and a half-company  of the 99th.  The enemy tried to outflank their left, and Captain  Campbell with a portion of the naval brigade and some of the native  contingent went out and drove them from a kraal of which they had taken  possession.  A still farther advance was now made, and the Zulus took to  flight, leaving 300 dead upon the ground.  The attacking party were 5000  strong, and against these some 500 or 600 of our troops were engaged.  We had only eight Europeans killed and four natives, and about twenty  wounded.  The next day Colonel Pearson reached Ekowe.  The position was  a strong one, as the place stood upon rising ground; it had been a  missionary station, and there was a church which could at the worst be  converted into a citadel.    \"Colonel Pearson at once set to work to fortify the position.  The same  evening the news arrived of the disaster at Isandula.  After a  consultation with his officers Colonel Pearson decided to hold the spot  at which he now was, convinced that, without further supplies of  reinforcements, he could hold the place for two months.  In order to  economise food, the mounted men and most of the natives were sent back,  and there remained 1200 British troops.    \"Colonel Pearson at once commenced his preparations for a siege.  Three  moderate-sized brick erections were turned into store-houses, and the  church into a hospital, the tower making a capital look-out; from this a  splendid view was obtained, the hill by the Tugela being clearly  visible.  The men set to work to fortify the place.  The intrenchments  were of a six-sided form, about sixty yards across, with a ditch outside  them eighteen feet deep and twelve feet wide.  Assegais were planted in  the bottom.  Added to the south side was a kraal for cattle and horses,  also defended by a small wall.  Outside the fort were entanglements of  rows of felled trees and bushes.  The supply of water was obtained from  a good well, outside the walls, but covered by the fire of the fort.  The guns were placed in position, and the garrison was ready for any  attack that might be made upon them.  All these details we learned in  the early days of the siege by occasional messengers, who managed to  find their way through, but these had been few and far between; of  twelve messengers sent out the first week of February, only one got  through.  The garrison had made several sorties, and had destroyed  Dabulamanzi's kraal.  They also went out and cut off a large convoy of  cattle on its way to Ulundi.\"    \"But how have they found out what is being done at Ekowe, if the first  week only one messenger got through out of twelve?\"  Dick said.    \"By a very ingenious plan, Dick.  For three weeks we knew nothing of  what was going on, and then it struck an engineer that communication  might be established by flashing signals.\"    \"What are flashing signals, father?\"    \"Well, my boy, as a general rule they are made by showing a light either  for a long or short period.  Thus, one long and one short might be A;  one short and one long, B; two short and one long, C; and so on all  through the Alphabet.  The distance was so great that ordinary lights  would not have answered, but it struck one of the engineers that with a  looking-glass the sunlight might be reflected.  You know at what a  distance the sun's reflection on a window can be made out.  Well, it was  tried in vain for a whole week by Lieutenant Haynes, of the Royal  Engineers, but at the end of that time he was delighted at seeing  answering flashes from the hill on which Ekowe stands.  Since that time  news has been regularly received every day by this means of what is  passing in the fort.    \"In the meantime preparations were being made for the relief of the  garrison.  The news of the defeat at Isandula was sent home by a swift  ship, by which the particulars were telegraphed from Saint Vincent.  The  people at home did not lose an hour.  The _Shah_, which was on her way  home, heard the news at Saint Helena, and Captain Bradshaw, who  commanded her, at once, on his own responsibility, turned his ship's  head south, and steered for Durban, bringing with him the garrison of  the island.  Some draughts from the 4th, 88th, and 99th Regiments were  brought down from the Cape; the _Boadicea_ also arrived, and every man  who could be spared from her and the _Shah_ was landed and sent up to  the Tugela.    \"In the second week in March the 57th and 91st Regiments arrived from  England.  One hundred and sixty men were brought over from the garrison  of Mauritius, and a few days later the 3rd battalion of the 60th  Regiment also arrived.  These assembled on the Tugela on the 27th, and  that day set out.  The vanguard was composed of the seamen and marines  of the _Shah_ and _Tenedos_--640 men and two gatlings, the 91st regiment  of 900 men, 400 men of the 99th, 180 men of the 3rd Buffs, 150 mounted  infantry, 200 of the mounted native contingent, and 1600 men of the  native infantry contingent.  The second division consisted of 200 men of  the _Boadicea_ with gatlings, the 37th Regiment, and the 3rd battalion  of the 60th, 900 men, and two troops of mounted natives.  That is all I  can tell you, my boy.  The news only arrived here yesterday that they  had started.  In the course of three or four more days I hope that we  shall hear that they have given the Zulus a thorough licking.  It is a  strong force, and as there are about 3300 white troops among them, and  there is no fear of their being taken by surprise this time, we need not  have any anxiety about the result.  I understand that, in accordance  with the advice which Colonel Pearson has flashed from Ekowe, they are  not going to follow the road he took, but to keep along on the lower  ground near the sea.\"    \"And do you think, father, that they will push on for Ulundi when they  have rescued the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#16)"],[1,"you are to learn but one hitch, this  will be the best for you, although certain others, as I shall explain  under their proper captions, are better adapted to certain  circumstances.    The diamond hitch is also much discussed. I have heard more arguments  over it than over the Japanese war or original sin.    \"That thing a diamond hitch!\" shrieks a son of the foothills to a son of  the alkali. \"Go to! Looks more like a game of cat's cradle. Now _this_  is the real way to throw a diamond.\"    [Sidenote: Colorado Versus Arizona]    Certain pacifically inclined individuals have attempted to quell the  trouble by a differentiation of nomenclature. Thus one can throw a  number of diamond hitches, provided one is catholically minded--such as  the \"Colorado diamond,\" the \"Arizona diamond,\" and others. The attempt  at peace has failed.    \"Oh, yes,\" says the son of the alkali as he watches the attempts of the  son of the foothills. \"That's the _Colorado_ diamond,\" as one would say  that is a _paste_ jewel.    The joke of it is that the results are about the same. Most of the  variation consists in the manner of throwing. It is as though the  discussion were whether the trigger should be pulled with the fore,  middle, or both fingers. After all, the bullet would go anyway.    [Illustration: A downward journey]    I describe here the single diamond, as thrown in the Sierra Nevadas, and  the double diamond as used by government freight packers in many parts  of the Rockies. The former is a handy one-man hitch. The latter can be  used by one man, but is easier with two.    [Sidenote: The Single Diamond]    Throw the pack cinch (_a_) over the top of the pack, retaining the loose  end of the rope. If your horse is bad, reach under him with a stick to  draw the cinch within reach of your hand until you hold it and the loose  end both on the same side of the animal. Hook it through the hook (_a_,  Fig. II) and bring up along the pack. Thrust the bight (_a_, Fig. III)  of the loose rope under the rope (_b_); the back over and again under to  form a loop. The points (_c_-_c_) at which the loose rope goes around  the pack rope can be made wide apart or close together, according to the  size of the diamond required (Fig. V). With a soft top-pack requiring  flattening, the diamond should be large; with heavy side pack,  smaller.    [Illustration: _THE SINGLE DIAMOND._]    Now go around to the other side of the animal. Pass the loose end (_d_,  Fig. III) back, under the alforjas, forward and through the loop from  below as shown by the arrows of direction in Fig. IV.    [Sidenote: The Single Diamond]    You are now ready to begin tightening. First pull your cinch tight by  means of what was the loose end (_b_) in Fig. II. Place one foot against  the animal and _heave_, good and plenty. Take up the slack by running  over both ends of the loop (_c_-_c_ Fig. III). When you have done this,  go around the other side. There take up the slack on _b_-_b_ Fig. IV.  With all there is in you pull the loose end (_c_, Fig. IV) in the  direction of the horse's body, toward his head. Brace your foot against  the kyacks. It will sag the whole hitch toward the front of the pack,  but don't mind that: the defect will be remedied in a moment.    Next, still holding the slack (Fig. V), carry the loose end around the  bottom of the alforjas and under the original main pack rope (_c_). Now  pull again along the direction of the horse's body, but this time  toward his tail. The strain will bend the pack rope (_c_), heretofore  straight across, back to form the diamond. It will likewise drag back to  its original position amidships in the pack the entire hitch, which, you  will remember, was drawn too far forward by your previous pull toward  the horse's head. Thus the last pull tightens the entire pack, clamps it  down, secures it immovably, which is the main recommendation and  beautiful feature of the diamond hitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 1    Fig. 2    Fig. 3    _THE DOUBLE DIAMOND._]    [Illustration: Fig. 4    Fig. 5    Fig. 6    _THE DOUBLE DIAMOND._]    [Sidenote: The Double Diamond]    The double diamond is a much more complicated affair. Begin by throwing  the cinch under, not over the horse. Let it lie there. Lay the end of  the rope (_a_) lengthwise of the horse across one side the top of the  pack (Fig. 1). Experience will teach you just how big to leave loop  (_b_). Throw loop (_b_) over top of pack (Fig. 2). Reverse loop _a_  (Fig. 2) by turning it from left to right (Fig. 3). Pass loop (_a_)  around front and back of kyack, and end of rope _d_ over rope _c_, and  under rope _d_. Pass around the horse and hook the cinch hook in loop  (_e_).    This forms another loop (_a_, Fig. 4), which must be extended to the  proper size and passed around the kyack on the other side (Fig. 5). Now  tighten the cinch, pull up the slack, giving strong heaves where the  hitch pulls forward or back along the left of the horse, ending with a  last tightener at the end (_b_, Fig. 5). The end is then carried back  under the kyack and fastened.    [Sidenote: The Square Hitch]    3. _The Square Hitch_ is easily and quickly thrown, and is a very good  fair-weather lash. In conjunction with half hitches, as later explained,  it makes a good hitch for a bucking horse. For a very bulky pack it is  excellent in that it binds in so many places. It is thrown as follows:    [Illustration: _The Square Hitch._]    [Sidenote: The Square Hitch]    Throw the cinch hook over the pack, and cinch tight with the jam hitch  before described. Lead the end across the horse, around the back of  kyack on the other side, underneath it, and up over at _a_. The end  here passes beneath at _b_. You will find that you can, when you cinch  up at first, throw a loose loop over the pack comprising the bight  _bed_, so as to leave your loose end at _d_. Then place the loop _bed_  around the kyack. A moment's study of the diagram will show you what I  mean, and will also convince you that much is gained by not having to  pass rope (_a_) underneath at _b_. Now pull hard on loose end at _d_,  taking care to exert your power lengthwise of the horse. Pass the line  under the alforjas toward the rear, up over the pack and under the  original rope at _c_. Pull on the loose end, this time exerting the  power toward the rear. You cannot put too much strength into the three  tightening pulls: (1) in cinching through the cinch hook; (2) the pull  forward; (3) the pull back. On them depends the stability of your pack.  Double back the loose end and fasten it. This is a very quick hitch.    [Sidenote: The Bucking Hitch]    4. _The Bucking Hitch_ is good to tie things down on a bad horse, but it  is otherwise useless to take so much trouble.    Pass the pack rope around the kyacks on one side, and over itself. This  forms a half hitch, below which hangs the cinch. Lead the pack rope  over the top of the pack, around the other kyack, and through to form  another half hitch. Cinch up, and throw either the single diamond or the  square hitch. The combination will clamp the kyacks as firmly as  anything can.    [Illustration: _The Bucking Hitch._]    [Sidenote: The Miner's Hitch]    5. _The Miner's Hitch._--This hitch is very much on the same principle,  but is valuable when you happen to be provided with only a short rope,  or a cinch with two rings, instead of a ring and a hook.    [Illustration: _The Miner's Hitch._]    [Sidenote: The Miner's Hitch]    Take your rope--with the cinch unattached--by the middle and throw it  across the pack. Make a half hitch over either kyack. These half  hitches, instead of running around the sides of the kyacks, as in the  last hitch, should run around the top, bottom, and ends (see diagram).  Thrust bight (_b_) through cinch ring, and end (_a_) through the bight.  Do the same thing on the other side. Make fast end _a_ at _c_, and end  _d_ at _e_, cinching up strongly on the bights that come through the  cinch rings.    [Illustration: Fig. 1    Fig. 2    Fig. 3    _THE LONE PACKER HITCH._]    [Illustration: Fig. 4    Fig. 5    _The Lone Packer Hitch._]    [Sidenote: The Lone Packer Hitch]    6. _The Lone Packer or Basco Hitch._--This is a valuable hitch when the  kyacks are heavy or knobby, because the last pull lifts them away from  the horse's sides. It requires at least forty feet of rope. I use it a  great deal.    [Sidenote: The Lone Packer Hitch]    Cinch up with the jam hitch as usual. Throw the end of the rope across  the horse, under the forward end of the kyack on the far side, beneath  it and up over the rear end of the kyack. The rope in all other hitches  binds against the bottom of the kyacks; but in this it should pass  between the kyack and the horse's side (Fig. 1). Now bring a bight in  loose end (_a_) forward _over_ rope (_c_), and thrust it through _under_  rope (_c_) from front to back (Fig. 2). Be sure to get this right.  Hold bight (_b_) with left hand where it is, and with the other slide  end (_a_) down along rope (_c_) until beneath the kyacks (Fig. 3). Seize  rope at _d_ and pull hard directly back; then pull cinchwise on _a_. The  first pull tightens the pack; the second lifts the kyacks. Carry end  (_a_) across the pack and repeat on the other side. Fasten finally  anywhere on top. Fig. 4 shows one side completed, with rope thrown  across ready for the other side. Fig. 5 is a view from above of the  hitch, completed except for the fastening of end (_a_).    [Sidenote: A Modification]    In case you have eggs or glassware to pack, spread your tarp on the  horse twice as long as usual. Cinch up with the jam hitch, lay your  eggs, etc., atop the rope; fold back the canvas to cover the whole, and  then throw the lone packer, placing one rope each side the package  (Figs. 6 and 7).    [Sidenote: The Squaw Hitch]    7. _The Squaw Hitch._--Often it may happen that you find yourself  possessed of a rope and a horse, but nothing else. It is quite"]]]
