The stem and platinum wire may now be protected by covering them with  a little flint glass.  For this purpose the flint-glass tube is pulled  down till it will just slip over the stem and wire, and is cut off so  as to leave about half a centimetre of platinum wire projecting.  The  flint-glass tube is then fused down upon the platinum wire, care being  taken to avoid the presence of air bubbles.  At the close of the  operation a single drop of white enamel glass is fused round the  platinum wire at a high temperature, so as to make a good joint with  the protecting flint-glass tube.    The negative electrode being nearly as large as the main tube, it must  be introduced before the latter is drawn down for sealing.  After  drawing down the main tube in the usual manner, taking care not to  make it less than a millimetre in wall-thickness, it is cut off so as  to leave a hole not quite big enough for the enamel drop to pass  through.  By heating and opening, the aperture is got just large  enough to allow the enamel drop to pass into it, and when this is the  case the joint is sealed, pulled, and blown out until the electrode  occupies the right position--viz.  in the centre of the tube and with  its face normal to the axis of the tube.    The glass walls near the negative electrode must not be less than a  millimetre thick, and may be rather more with advantage, the glass  must be even, and the joint between the flint glass and the soda  glass, or between the wire and the soda glass, must be wholly through  the enamel.  The \"seal\" must be well annealed.  It will be found that  the sealing-in process is much easier when the stem of the electrode  is short and when the glass coating is not too heavy.  Half a  millimetre of glass thickness round the stein is quite sufficient.    The diagram, of the tube shows that the main tube has been expanded  round the edges of the cathode.  This is to reduce the heating  consequent on the projection of cathode rays from the edges of the  disc against the glass tube.    The anode is inserted into its bulb in a quite similar manner.  If  desired it may be made considerably smaller, and does not need the  careful adjustment requisite in sealing-in the cathode, nor does the  glass near the entry wire require to be so thick.    More intense effects are often got by making the cathode slightly  concave, but in this case the risk of melting the thin glass is  considerably increased.  No doubt, Bohemian glass might be used  throughout instead of soft soda glass, and this would not melt so  easily; the difficulties of manipulating the glass are, however, more  pronounced.    It will be shown directly that the best Roentgen effects are got with  a high vacuum, and it is for this reason that the glass near the  cathode seal requires to be strong.  The potential right up to the  cathode is strongly positive inside the tube, and this causes the  glass to be exposed to a strong electric stress in the neighbourhood  of the seal.    Although the glass-blowing involved in the making of a so-called focus  tube is rather more difficult than in the case just described, there  is no reason why such a difficulty should not be overcome;  I will  therefore explain how a focus tube may be made.    Fig. 41.    A bulb about 3 inches in diameter is blown from a bit of tube of a  little more than 1 inch diameter.  Unless the walls of the tube are  about one-eighth of an inch in thickness, this will involve a  preliminary thickening up of the glass.  This is not difficult if care  be taken to avoid making the glass too hot.  The larger gas jet  described in connection with the soda-glass-blowing table must be  employed.  In blowing a bulb of this size it must not be forgotten  that draughts exercise a very injurious influence by causing the glass  to cool unequally;  this leads to bulbs of irregular shape.    In the method of construction shown in Fig.  41, the anode is put in  first.  This anode simply consists of a square bit of platinum or  platinum-iridium foil, measuring about 0.75 inch by 1 inch, and  riveted on to a bent aluminium wire stem.    As soon as the anode is fused in, and while the glass is still hot,  the side tube is put on.  The whole of the anode end is then carefully  annealed.  When the annealing is finished the side tube is bent as  shown to serve as a handle when the time comes to mount the cathode.  Before placing the cathode in position, and while the main tube is  still wide open, the anode is adjusted by means of a tool thrust in  through this open end.  This is necessary in view of the fact that the  platinum foil is occasionally bent during the operation of forcing the  anode into the bulb.    The cathode is a portion of a spherical surface of polished aluminium,  a mode of preparing which will be given directly.  The cathode having  been placed inside the bulb, the wide glass tube is carefully drawn  down and cut off at such a point that when the cathode is in position  its centre of curvature will lie slightly in front of the anode plate.  For instance, if the radius of curvature of the cathode be 1.5 inches,  the centre of curvature may lie something like an eighth of an inch or  less in front of the anode.    The cathode as shown in Fig.  41 is rather smaller than is  advantageous.  To make it much larger than is shown, however, the  opening into the bulb would require to be considerably widened, and  though this is not really a difficult operation, still it requires  more practice than my readers are likely to have had.  The difficulty  is not so much in widening out the entry as in closing it down again  neatly.    Now as to making the anode.  A disc of aluminium is cut from a sheet  which must not be too thick--one twenty-fifth of an inch is quite  thick enough.  This disc is bored at the centre to allow of the stem  being riveted in position.  The disc is then annealed in the Bunsen  flame and the stem riveted on.    The curvature is best got by striking between steel dies (see Figs.  39 and 40).  Two bits of tool steel are softened and turned on the  lathe, one convex and the other concave.  The concave die has a small  hole drilled up the centre to admit the stem. The desired radius of  curvature is easily attained by cutting out templates from sheet zinc  and using them to gauge the turning.  The two dies are slightly ground  together on the lathe with emery and oil and are then polished, or  rather the convex die is polished--the other one does not matter.  The polishing is most easily done by using graded emery and oil and  polishing with a rag.  The method of grading emery will be described  in the chapter on glass-grinding.    The aluminium disc is now struck between the dies by means of a  hammer.  If the radius of curvature is anything more than one inch and  the disc not more than one inch in diameter the cathode can be struck  at once from the flat as described.  For very deep curves no doubt it  will be better to make an intermediate pair of dies and to re-anneal  the aluminium after the first striking.    When the tube is successfully prepared so far as the glassblowing goes  it may be rinsed with strong pure alcohol both inside and out, and  dried.  The straight part of the side tube is then constricted ready  for fusing off and the whole affair is placed on the vacuum pump.    In spite of the great improvements made during recent years in the  construction of so-called Geissler vacuum pumps--i.e.  pumps in which  a Torricellian vacuum is continually reproduced--I am of opinion that  Sprengel pumps are, on the whole, more convenient for exhausting  Crooke's tubes.  A full discussion of the subject of vacuum pumps will  be found in a work by Mr. G.  S.  Ram (The Incandescent Lamp and its  Manufacture), published by the Electrician Publishing Company, and it  is not my intention to deal with the matter here; the simplest kind of  Sprengel pump will be found quite adequate for our purpose, provided  that it is well made.    Fig.  42 is intended to represent a modification of a pump based on  the model manufactured by Hicks of Hatton Garden, and arranged to suit  the amateur glass-blower.  The only point of importance is the  construction of the head of the fall tube, of which a separate and  enlarged diagram is given.  The fall tubes may have an internal  diameter up to 2 mm. (two millimetres) and an effective length of 120  cm.    Free use is made of rubber tube connections in the part of the pump  exposed to the passage of mercury.  The rubber employed should be  black and of the highest quality, having the walls strengthened by a  layer of canvas.  If such tube cannot be easily obtained, a very good  substitute may be made by placing a bit of ordinary black tube inside  another and rather larger bit and binding the outer tube with tape or  ribbon.  In any case the tubing which comes in contact with the  mercury should be boiled in strong caustic potash or soda solution for  at least ten minutes to get rid of free sulphur, which fouls the  mercury directly it comes in contact with it.  The tubing is well  washed, rinsed with alcohol, and carefully dried.    Fig.  42.    The diagram represents what is practically a system of three Sprengel  pumps, though they are all fed from the same mercury reservoir and run  down into the same mercury receiver.  It is much easier to make three  pumps, each with separate pinch cocks to regulate the mercury supply,  than it is to make three jets, each delivering exactly the proper  stream of mercury to three fall tubes.    Sprengel pumps only work at their highest efficiency when the mercury  supply is carefully regulated to suit the peculiarities of each fall  tube, and this is quite easily done in the model figured.  Since on  starting the pump the rubber connections have to stand a considerable  pressure, the ends "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],[0,"The accomplisht cook (#16)"],[1,"them small with the liver, put  to it some crumbs of grated white-bread, a little of the broth of  the Cock, and some large mace; stew them together with some gravy,  then dissolve the yolks of two eggs with some wine vinegar, and a  little grated nutmeg, and when you are ready to dish it, put the  eggs to it, and stir it among the sauce with a little butter; dish  them on sippets, and run the sauce over them with some beaten butter  and capers, or lemon minced small, barberries, or whole pickled  grapes.

For the lears of thickening, yolks of hard eggs strained with some  of the broth, or strained almond past with some of the broth, or  else strained bread and sorrel.    Otherways you may boil the former fowls either bon'd and trust up  with a farsing of some minc'd veal or mutton, and seasoned as the  former in all points, with those materials, or boil it with the  bones in being trust up. A turkey to bake, and break the bones.    Otherways bone the fowl, and fill the body with the foresaid  farsing, or make a pudding of grated bread, minced suet of beef or  veal, seasoned with cloves, mace, pepper, salt, and grapes, fill the  body, and prick up the back, and stew it as is aforesaid.    Or make the pudding of grated bread beef-suet minc'd some currans,  nutmegs, cloves, sugar, sweet herbs, salt, juyce of spinage; if  yellow, saffron, some minced meat, cream, eggs, and barberries: fill  the fowl and stew it in mutton broth & white wine, with the gizzard,  liver, and bones, stew it down well, then have some artichock  bottoms boil'd and quarter'd, some potatoes boil'd and blanch'd, and  some dates quarter'd, and some marrow boil'd in water and salt; for  the garnish some boil'd skirret or pleasant pears. Then make a lear  of almond paste strained with mutton broth, for the thickning of the  former broth.    Otherways simple, being stuffed with parsley, serve it in with  butter, vinegar, and parsley, boil'd and minced; as also bacon  boil'd on it, or about it, in two pieces; and two saucers of green  sauce.    Or otherways for variety, boil your fowl in water and salt, then  take strong broth, and put in a faggot of sweet herbs, mace, marrow,  cucumber slic't, and thin slices of interlarded bacon, and salt, _&c._        _To boil Capons, Pullets, Chickens, Pigeons,      Pheasants or Partridges._    Searce them either with the bone or boned, then take off the skin  whole, with the legs, wings, neck, and head on, mince the body with  some bacon or beef suet, season it with nutmeg, pepper, cloves,  beaten ginger, salt, and a few sweet herbs finely minced and mingled  amongst some three or four yolks of eggs, some sugar, whole grapes,  gooseberries, barberries, and pistaches; fill the skins, and prick  them up in the back, then stew them between two dishes, with some  strong broth, white-wine, butter, some large mace, marrow,  gooseberries and sweet herbs, being stewed, serve them on sippets,  with some marrow and slic't lemon; in winter, currans.        _To boil a Capon or Chicken in white Broth._    First boil the Capon in water and salt, then take three pints of  strong broth, and a quart of white-wine, and stew it in a pipkin  with a quarter of a pound of dates, half a pound of fine sugar, four  or five blades of large mace, the marrow of three marrow bones,  a handful of white endive; stew these in a pipkin very leisurely,  that it may but only simmer; then being finely stewed, and the broth  well tasted, strain the yolks of ten eggs with some of the broth.  Before you dish up the capon or chickens, put in the eggs into the  broth, and keep it stirring, that it may not curdle, give it a warm,  and set it from the fire: the fowls being dished up put on the  broth, and garnish the meat with dates, marrow, large mace, endive,  preserved barberries, and oranges, boil'd skirrets, poungarnet, and  kernels. Make a lear of almond paste and grape verjuice.        _To boil a Capon in the Italian Fashion with Ransoles,      a very excellent way._    Take a young Capon, draw it and truss it to boil, pick it very  clean, and lay it in fair water, and parboil it a little, then boil  it in strong broth till it be enough, but first prepare your  Ransoles as followeth: Take a good quantity of beet leaves, and boil  them in fair water very tender, and press out the water clean from  them, then take six sweetbreads of veal, boil and mince them very  small and the herbs also, the marrow of four or five marrow-bones,  and the smallest of the marrow keep, and put it to your minced  sweetbreads and herbs, and keep bigger pieces, and boil them in  water by it self, to lay on the Capon, and upon the top of the dish,  then take raisons of the sun ston'd, and mince them small with half  a pound of dates, and a quarter of a pound of pomecitron minced  small, and a pound of Naples-bisket grated, and put all these  together into a great, large dish or charger, with half a pound of  sweet butter, and work it with your hands into a peice of paste, and  season it with a little nutmeg, cinamon, ginger, and salt, and some  parmisan grated and some fine sugar also and mingle them well, then  make a peice of paste of the finest flower, six yolks of raw eggs,  a little saffron beaten small, half a pound of butter and a little  salt, with some fair water hot, (not boiling) and make up the paste,  then drive out a long sheet with a rowling pin as thin as you can  possible, and lay the ingredients in small heaps, round or long on  the paste, then cover them with the paste, and cut them off with a  jag asunder, and make two hundred or more, and boil them in a broad  kettle of strong broth, half full of liquor; and when it boils put  the Ransols in one by one and let them boil a quarter of an hour;  then take up the Capon into a fair large dish, and lay on the  Ransoles, and stew on them grated cheese or parmisan, and  Naples-bisket grated, cinamon and sugar; and thus between every lay  till you have filled the dish, and pour on melted butter with a  little strong broath, then the marrow, pomecitron, lemons slic't,  and serve it up; or you may fry half the Ransoles in clarified  butter, _&c._        _A rare Fricase._    Take six pigeon and six chicken-peepers, scald and truss them being  drawn clean, head and all on, then set them, and have some  lamb-stones and sweet-breads blanch'd, parboild and slic't, fry most  of the sweet-breads flowred; have also some asparagus ready, cut off  the tops an inch long, the yolk of two hard eggs, pistaches, the  marrow of six marrow-bones, half the marrow fried green, & white  butter, let it be kept warm till it be almost dinner time; then have  a clean frying-pan, and fry the fowl with good sweet butter, being  finely fryed put out the butter, & put to them some roast mutton  gravy, some large fried oysters and some salt; then put in the hard  yolks of eggs, and the rest of the sweet-breads that are not fried,  the pistaches, asparagus, and half the marrow: then stew them well  in the frying-pan with some grated nutmeg, pepper, a clove or two of  garlick if you please, a little white-wine, and let them be well  stew'd. Then have ten yolks of eggs dissolved in a dish with  grape-verjuice or wine-vinegar, and a little beaten mace, and put it  to the frycase, then have a French six penny loaf slic't into a fair  larg dish set on coals, with some good mutton gravy, then give the  frycase two or three warms on the fire, and pour it on the sops in  the dish; garnish it with fried sweet-breads, fried oysters, fried  marrow, pistaches, slic't almonds and the juyce of two or three  oranges.        _Capons in Pottage in the _French_ Fashion._    Draw and truss the Capons, set them, & fill their bellies with  marrow; then put them in a pipkin with a knuckle of veal, a neck of  mutton, a marrow bone, and some sweet breads of veal, season the  broth with cloves mace, and a little salt, and set it to the fire;  let it boil gently till the capons be enough,"]]]
