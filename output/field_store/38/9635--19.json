What the object of senile  avarice may be I cannot conceive. For can there be anything more absurd  than to seek more journey money, the less there remains of the journey?    19. There remains the fourth reason, which more than anything else  appears to torment men of my age and keep them in a flutter--THE  NEARNESS OF DEATH, which, it must be allowed, cannot be far from an old  man. But what a poor dotard must he be who has not learnt in the course  of so long a life that death is not a thing to be feared? Death, that is  either to be totally disregarded, if it entirely extinguishes the soul,  or is even to be desired, if it brings him where he is to exist forever.  A third alternative, at any rate, cannot possibly be discovered. Why  then should I be afraid if I am destined either not to be miserable  after death or even to be happy? After all, who is such a fool as to  feel certain--however young he may be--that he will be alive in the  evening? Nay, that time of life has many more chances of death than  ours, Young men more easily contract diseases; their illnesses are more  serious; their treatment has to be more severe. Accordingly, only a few  arrive at old age. If that were not so, life would be conducted better  and more wisely; for it is in old men that thought, reason, and prudence  are to be found; and if there had been no old men, States would never  have existed at all. But I return to the subject of the imminence of  death. What sort of charge is this against old age, when you see that it  is shared by youth? I had reason in the case of my excellent son--as you  had, Scipio, in that of your brothers, who were expected to attain the  highest honours--to realise that death is common to every time of life.  Yes, you will say; but a young man expects to live long; an old man  cannot expect to do so. Well, he is a fool to expect it. For what can be  more foolish than to regard the uncertain as certain, the false as true?  \"An old man has nothing even to hope.\" Ah, but it is just there that  he is in a better position than a young man, since what the latter only  hopes he has obtained. The one wishes to live long; the other has lived  long.    And yet, good heaven! what is \"long\" in a man's life? For grant  the utmost limit: let us expect an age like that of the King of the  Tartessi. For there was, as I find recorded, a certain Agathonius at  Gades who reigned eighty years and lived a hundred and twenty. But to my  mind nothing seems even long in which there is any \"last,\" for when that  arrives, then all the past has slipped away--only that remains to which  you have attained by virtue and righteous actions. Hours indeed, and  days and months and years depart, nor does past time ever return, nor  can the future be known. Whatever time each is granted for life, with  that he is bound to be content. An actor, in order to earn approval,  is not bound to perform the play from beginning to end; let him only  satisfy the audience in whatever act he appears. Nor need a wise man go  on to the concluding \"plaudite.\" For a short term of life is long enough  for living well and honourably. But if you go farther, you have no more  right to grumble than farmers do because the charm of the spring season  is past and the summer and autumn have come. For the word \"spring\" in a  way suggests youth, and points to the harvest to be: the other seasons  are suited for the reaping and storing of the crops. Now the harvest of  old age is, as I have often said, the memory and rich store of blessings  laid up in easier life. Again, all things that accord with nature are to  be counted as good. But what can be more in accordance with nature  than for old men to die? A thing, indeed, which also befalls young men,  though nature revolts and fights against it. Accordingly, the death of  young men seems to me like putting out a great fire with a deluge of  water; but old men die like a fire going out because it has burnt down  of its own nature without artificial means. Again, just as apples when  unripe are torn from trees, but when ripe and mellow drop down, so it  is violence that takes life from young men, ripeness from old. This  ripeness is so delightful to me, that, as I approach nearer to death,  I seem as it were to be sighting land, and to be coming to port at last  after a long voyage.    20. Again, there is no fixed borderline for old age, and you are making  a good and proper use of it as long as you can satisfy the call of duty  and disregard death. The result of this is, that old age is even more  confident and courageous than youth. That is the meaning of Solon's  answer to the tyrant Pisistratus. When the latter asked him what he  relied upon in opposing him with such boldness, he is said to have  replied, \"On my old age.\" But that end of life is the best, when,  without the intellect or senses being impaired, Nature herself takes  to pieces her own handiwork which she also put together. Just as the  builder of a ship or a house can break them up more easily than any one  else, so the nature that knit together the human frame can also  best unfasten it. Moreover, a thing freshly glued together is always  difficult to pull asunder; if old, this is easily done.    The result is that the short time of life left to them is not to be  grasped at by old men with greedy eagerness, or abandoned without cause.  Pythagoras forbids us, without an order from our commander, that is God,  to desert life's fortress and outpost. Solon's epitaph, indeed, is that  of a wise man, in which he says that he does not wish his death to be  unaccompanied by the sorrow and lamentations of his friends. He wants, I  suppose, to be beloved by them. But I rather think Ennius says better:    None grace me with their tears, nor weeping loud Make sad my funeral  rites!    He holds that a death is not a subject for mourning when it is followed  by immortality.    Again, there may possibly be some sensation of dying and that only for  a short time, especially in the case of an old man: after death, indeed,  sensation is either what one would desire, or it disappears altogether.  But to disregard death is a lesson which must be studied from our youth  up; for unless that is learnt, no one can have a quiet mind. For die we  certainly must, and that too without being certain whether it may not be  this very day. As death, therefore, is hanging over our head every hour,  how can a man ever be unshaken in soul if he fears it?    But on this theme I don't think I need much enlarge: when I remember  what Lucius Brutus did, who was killed while defending his country; or  the two Decii, who spurred their horses to a gallop and met a voluntary  death; or M. Atilius Regulus, who left his home to confront a death of  torture, rather than break the word which he had pledged to the enemy;  or the two Scipios, who determined to block the Carthaginian advance  even with their own bodies; or your grandfather Lucius Paulus, who  paid with his life for the rashness of his colleague in the disgrace at  Cannae; or M. Marcellus, whose death not even the most bloodthirsty of  enemies would allow to go without the honour of burial. It is enough to  recall that our legions (as I have recorded in my _Origins_) have  often marched with cheerful and lofty spirit to ground from which they  believed that they would never return. That, therefore, which young  men--not only uninstructed, but absolutely ignorant--treat as of no  account, shall men who are neither young nor ignorant shrink from in  terror? As a general truth, as it seems to me, it is weariness of all  pursuits that creates weariness of life. There are certain pursuits  adapted to childhood: do young men miss them? There are others suited  to early manhood: does that settled time of life called \"middle age\" ask  for them? There are others, again, suited to that age, but not looked  for in old age. There are, finally, some which belong to Old age.  Therefore, as the pursuits of the earlier ages have their time for  disappearing, so also have those of old age. And when that takes place,  a satiety of life brings on the ripe time for death.    21. For I do not see why I should not venture to tell you my personal  opinion as to death, of which I seem to myself to have a clearer vision  in proportion as I am nearer to it. I believe, Scipio and Laelius, that  your fathers--those illustrious men and my dearest friends--are still  alive, and that too with a life which alone deserves the name. For as  long as we are imprisoned in this framework of the body, we perform a  certain function and laborious work assigned us by fate. The soul, in  fact, is of heavenly origin, forced down from its home in the highest,  and, so to speak, buried in earth, a place quite opposed to its divine  nature and its immortality. But I suppose the immortal gods to have sown  souls broadcast in human bodies, that there might be some to survey  the world, and while contemplating the order of the heavenly bodies to  imitate it in the unvarying regularity of their life. Nor is it only  reason and arguments that have brought me to this belief, but the great  fame and authority of the most distinguished philosophers. I used to  be told that Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans--almost natives of  our country, who in old times had been called the Italian school of  philosophers--never doubted that we had souls drafted from the universal  Divine intelligence. I used besides to have pointed out to me the  discourse delivered by Socrates on the last day of his life upon the  immortality of the soul--Socrates who was pronounced by the oracle at  Delphi to be the wisest of men. I need say no more. I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#16)"],[1,"boys and girl. Then she  took as many as twenty pieces of candle and fixed them upon the  branches. After that she softly called Rupert, Robert and Lucy, and told  them to get up and come into the kitchen.    Hurrying back, she began, with a bit of a burning stick, to light the  candles. Just as the last one was set aflame, in trooped the three  children.    Before they had time to say a word, they were silenced by their mother's  warning.    \"I wish to fetch Roger in and wake him up before it,\" she said. \"Keep  still until I come back!\"    The little lad, fast asleep, was lifted in a blanket and gently carried  by his mother into the beautiful presence.    \"See! Roger, my boy, see!\" she said, arousing him. \"It is Christmas  morning now! In England they only have Christmas-boughs, but here in New  England we have a whole Christmas-tree.\"    \"O mother!\" he cried. \"O Lucy! Is it really, really true, and no dream  at all? Yes, I see! I see! O mother, it is so beautiful! Were all the  trees on all the hills lighted up that way when Christ was born? And,  mother,\" he added, clapping his little hands with joy at the thought,  \"why, yes, the stars did sing when Christ was born! They must be glad,  then, and keep Christmas, too, in heaven. I know they must, and there  will be good times there.\"    \"Yes,\" said his mother; \"there will be good times there, Roger.\"    \"Then,\" said the boy, \"I sha'n't mind going, now that I've seen the  Christmas-bough. I--What is that, mother?\"    What was it that they heard? The little Olcott home had never before  seemed to tremble so. There were taps at the window, there were knocks  at the door--and it was as yet scarcely the break of day! There were  voices also, shouting something to somebody.    \"Shall I put out the candles, mother?\" whispered Robert.    \"What will they do to us for having the tree? I wish we hadn't it,\"  regretted Rupert; while Lucy clung to her mother's gown and shrieked  with all her strength, \"It's Indians!\"    Pale and white and still, ready to meet her fate, stood Mrs. Olcott,  until, out of the knocking and the tapping at her door, her heart caught  a sound. It was a voice calling, \"Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\"    \"Unbar the door!\" she cried back to her boys; \"it's your father  calling!\" Down came the blankets; up went the curtain; open flew the  door, and in walked Captain Olcott, followed by every man and woman in  Plymouth who had heard at break of day the glorious news that the  expected ship had arrived at Boston, and with it the long lost Captain  Olcott. For an instant nothing was thought of except the joyous  welcoming of the Captain in his new home.    \"What's this? What is it? What does this mean?\" was asked again and  again, when the first excitement was passed, as the tall young pine  stood aloft, its candles ablaze, its gifts still hanging.    \"It's welcome home to father!\" said Lucy, her only thought to screen her  mother.    \"No, child, no!\" sternly spoke Mrs. Olcott. \"Tell the truth!\"    \"It's--a--Christmas-tree!\" faltered poor Lucy.    One and another and another, Pilgrims and Puritans all, drew near with  faces stern and forbidding, and gazed and gazed, until one and another  and yet another softened slowly into a smile as little Roger's piping  voice sung out:    \"She made it for me, mother did. But you may have it now, and all the  pretty things that are on it, too, because you've brought my father back  again; if mother will let you,\" he added.    Neither Pilgrim nor Puritan frowned at the gift. One man, the sternest  there, broke off a little twig and said:    \"I'll take it for the sake of the good old times at home.\"          THE FIRST CHRISTMAS IN NEW ENGLAND.    BY HEZEKIAH BUTTERWORTH.           They thought they had come to their port that day,         But not yet was their journey done;       And they drifted away from Provincetown Bay         In the fireless light of the sun.       With rain and sleet were the tall masts iced,         And gloomy and chill was the air,       But they looked from the crystal sails to Christ,         And they came to a harbor fair.                 The white hills silent lay,--             For there were no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king,                 That gray, cold winter day.         The snow came down on the vacant seas,         And white on the lone rocks lay,--       But rang the axe 'mong the evergreen trees         And followed the Sabbath day.       Then rose the sun in a crimson haze,         And the workmen said at dawn:       \"Shall our axes swing on this day of days,         When the Lord of Life was born?\"                 The white hills silent lay,--             For there were no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king,                 That gray, cold Christmas Day.           \"The old town's bells we seem to hear:         They are ringing sweet on the Dee;       They are ringing sweet on the Harlem Meer,         And sweet on the Zuyder Zee.       The pines are frosted with snow and sleet.         Shall we our axes wield       When the chimes at Lincoln are ringing sweet         And the bells of Austerfield?\"                 The air was cold and gray,--             And there were no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king,                 That gray, cold Christmas Day.         Then the master said, \"Your axes wield,         Remember ye Malabarre Bay;       And the covenant there with the Lord ye sealed;         Let your axes ring to-day.       You may talk of the old town's bells to-night,         When your work for the Lord is done,       And your boats return, and the shallop's light         Shall follow the light of the sun.                 The sky is cold and gray,--             And here are no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king.                 This gray, cold Christmas Day.         \"If Christ was born on Christmas Day,         And the day by Him is blest,       Then low at His feet the evergreens lay         And cradle His church in the West.       Immanuel waits at the temple gates         Of the nation to-day ye found,       And the Lord delights in no formal rites;         To-day let your axes sound!\"                 The sky was cold and gray,--             And there were no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king,                 That gray, cold Christmas Day.         Their axes rang through the evergreen trees         Like the bells on the Thames and Tay;       And they cheerily sang by the windy seas,         And they thought of Malabarre Bay.       On the lonely heights of Burial Hill         The old Precisioners sleep;       But did ever men with a nobler will         A holier Christmas keep,                 When the sky was cold and gray,--             And there were no ancient bells to ring,             No priests to chant, no choirs to sing,             No chapel of baron, or lord, or king,                 That gray, cold Christmas Day?          THE CHIMES.    BY CHARLES DICKENS.      FIRST QUARTER.    There are not many people--and as it is desirable that a story-teller  and a story-reader should establish a mutual understanding as soon as  possible, I beg it to be noticed that I confine this observation neither  to young people nor to little people, but extend it to all conditions of  people: little and big, young and old: yet growing up, or already  growing down again--there are not, I say, many people who would care to  sleep in a church. I don't mean at sermon time in warm weather (when the  thing has actually been done, once or twice), but in the night, and  alone. A great multitude of persons will be violently astonished, I  know, by this position, in the broad bold Day. But it applies to Night.  It must be argued by night. And I will undertake to maintain it  successfully on any gusty winter's night appointed for the purpose, with  any one opponent chosen from the rest, who will meet me singly in an old  churchyard, before an old church door; and will previously empower me to  lock him in, if needful to his satisfaction, until morning.    For the night-wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round a  building of that sort, and moaning as it goes; and of trying with its  unseen hand, the windows and the doors; and seeking out some crevices by  which to enter. And when it has got in; as one not finding what it  seeks, whatever that may be, it wails and howls to issue forth again;  and not content with stalking through the aisles, and gliding round and  round the pillars, and tempting the deep organ, soars up to the roof,  and strives to rend the rafters; then flings itself despairingly upon  the stones below, and passes, muttering, into the vaults. Ugh! Heaven  preserve us, sitting snugly round the fire! It has an awful voice, that  wind at midnight, singing in a church!    But, high up in the steeple! There the foul blast roars and whistles!  High up in the steeple, where it is free to come and go through many an  airy arch and loophole, and to twist and twine itself about the giddy  stair, and twirl the groaning weathercock, and make the very tower shake  and shiver!    High up in the steeple of an old church, far above the light and murmur  of the town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it, is the wild  and dreary place at night: and high up in the steeple of an old church,  dwelt the Chimes I tell of.    They were old Chimes, trust me. Centuries ago, these Bells had been  baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their  baptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew"]]]
