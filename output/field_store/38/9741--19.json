Christabel Pankhurst, presiding over the second session of the Women's  Parliament, said: \"At last it is realized that women are fighting for  freedom, as their fathers fought. If they want twelve women, aye, and  more than twelve, if a hundred women are wanted to be tried under that  act and sent to prison for three months, they can be found.\"    I was not present at this session, nor had I been present at the first  one. I was working in a by-election at South Leeds, the last of several  important by-elections in great industrial centres, where our success  was unquestioned, except by the Liberal press. The elections had wound  up with a great procession, and a meeting of 100,000 people on Hounslet  Moor. The most wonderful enthusiasm marked that meeting. I shall never  forget what splendid order the people kept, in spite of the fact that no  police protection was given us; how the vast crowd parted to let our  procession through; how the throngs of mill women kept up a chorus in  broad Yorkshire: \"Shall us win? Shall us have the vote? We shall!\" No  wonder the old people shook their beads, and declared that \"there had  never been owt like it.\"          CHAPTER II      With those brave shouts in my ears, I hurried down to London for the  concluding session of the parliament, for I had determined that I must  be the first person to challenge the Government to carry out their  threat to revive the old Act of Charles II. I made a long speech to the  women that day, telling them something of my experiences of the past  months, and how all that I had seen and heard throughout the country had  only deepened my conviction of the necessity for women's votes. \"I  feel,\" I concluded, \"that the time has come when I must act, and I wish  to be one of those to carry our resolution to Parliament this afternoon.  My experience in the country, and especially in South Leeds, has taught  me things that Cabinet Ministers, who have not had that experience, do  not know, and has made me feel that I must make one final attempt to see  them, and to urge them to reconsider their position before some terrible  disaster has occurred.\"    Amid a good deal of excitement and emotion, we chose the requisite  thirteen women, who were prepared to be arrested and tried under the  Charles II \"Tumultuous Petitions\" Act. I had not entirely recovered from  the attack made upon me at Mid-Devon, and my wrenched ankle was still  too sensitive to make walking anything but a painful process. Seeing me  begin almost at once to limp badly, Mrs. Drummond, with characteristic,  blunt kindness, called to a man driving a dog-cart and asked him if he  would drive me to the House of Commons. He readily agreed, and I mounted  to the seat behind him, the other women forming in line behind the cart.  We had not gone far when the police, who already surrounded us in great  force, ordered me to dismount. Of course I obeyed and walked, or rather  limped along with my companions. They would have supported me, but the  police insisted that we should walk single-file. Presently I grew so  faint from the pain of the ankle that I called to two of the women, who  took hold of my arms and helped me on my way. This was our one act of  disobedience to police orders. We moved with difficulty, for the crowd  was of incredible size. All around, as far as eye could see, was the  great moving, swaying, excited multitude, and surrounding us on all  sides were regiments of uniformed police, foot and mounted. You might  have supposed that instead of thirteen women, one of them lame, walking  quietly along, the town was in the hands of an armed mob.    We had progressed as far as the entrance to Parliament Square, when two  stalwart policemen suddenly grasped my arms on either side and told me  that I was under arrest. My two companions, because they refused to  leave me, were also arrested, and a few minutes later Annie Kenney and  five other women suffered arrest. That night we were released on bail,  and the next morning we were arraigned in Westminster police court for  trial under the Charles II Act. But, as it turned out, the authorities,  embarrassed by our readiness to test the act, announced that they had  changed their minds, and would continue, for the present, to treat us as  common street brawlers.    This was my first trial, and I listened, with a suspicion that my ears  were playing tricks with my reason, to the most astonishing perjuries  put forth by the prosecution. I heard that we had set forth from Caxton  Hall with noisy shouts and songs, that we had resorted to the most  riotous and vulgar behaviour, knocking off policemen's helmets,  assaulting the officers right and left as we marched. Our testimony, and  that of our witnesses, was ignored. When I tried to speak in my own  defence, I was cut short rudely, and was told briefly that I and the  others must choose between being bound over or going to prison, in the  second division, for six weeks.    I remember only vaguely the long, jolting ride across London to Holloway  Prison. We stopped at Pentonville, the men's prison, to discharge  several men prisoners, and I remember shuddering at the thought of our  women, many of them little past girlhood, being haled to prison in the  same van with criminal men. Arriving at the prison, we groped our way  through dim corridors into the reception-ward, where we were lined up  against the wall for a superficial medical examination. After that we  were locked up in separate cells, unfurnished, except for low, wooden  stools.    It seemed an endless time before my cell door was opened by a wardress,  who ordered me to follow her. I entered a room where another wardress  sat at a table, ready to take an inventory of my effects. Obeying an  order to undress, I took off my gown, then paused. \"Take off  everything,\" was the next order. \"Everything?\" I faltered. It seemed  impossible that they expected me to strip. In fact, they did allow me to  take off my last garments in the shelter of a bath-room. I shivered  myself into some frightful underclothing, old and patched and stained,  some coarse, brown woollen stockings with red stripes, and the hideous  prison dress stamped all over with the broad arrow of disgrace. I fished  a pair of shoes out of a big basket of shoes, old and mostly mismates. A  pair of coarse but clean sheets, a towel, a mug of cold cocoa, and a  thick slice of brown bread were given me, and I was conducted to my  cell.    My first sensations when the door was locked upon me were not altogether  disagreeable. I was desperately weary, for I had been working hard,  perhaps a little too hard, for several strenuous months. The excitement  and fatigue of the previous day, and the indignation I had suffered  throughout the trial, had combined to bring me to the point of  exhaustion, and I was glad to throw myself on my hard prison bed and  close my eyes. But soon the relief of being alone, and with nothing to  do, passed from me. Holloway Prison is a very old place, and it has the  disadvantages of old places which have never known enough air and  sunshine. It reeks with the odours of generations of bad ventilation,  and it contrives to be at once the stuffiest and the draughtiest  building I have ever been in. Soon I found myself sickening for fresh  air. My head began to ache. Sleep fled. I lay all night suffering with  cold, gasping for air, aching with fatigue, and painfully wide awake.    The next day I was fairly ill, but I said nothing about it. One does not  expect to be comfortable in prison. As a matter of fact, one's mental  suffering is so much greater than any common physical distress that the  latter is almost forgotten. The English prison system is altogether  mediaeval and outworn. In some of its details the system has improved  since they began to send the Suffragettes to Holloway. I may say that  we, by our public denunciation of the system, have forced these slight  improvements. In 1907 the rules were excessively cruel. The poor  prisoner, when she entered Holloway, dropped, as it were, into a tomb.  No letters and no visitors were allowed for the first month of the  sentence. Think of it--a whole month, more than four weeks, without  sending or receiving a single word. One's nearest and dearest may have  gone through dreadful suffering, may have been ill, may have died,  meantime. One was given plenty of time to imagine all these things, for  the prisoner was kept in solitary confinement in a narrow, dimly-lit  cell, twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four. Solitary confinement is  too terrible a punishment to inflict on any human being, no matter what  his crime. Hardened criminals in the men's prisons, it is said, often  beg for the lash instead. Picture what it must be to a woman who has  committed some small offence, for most of the women who go to Holloway  are small offenders, sitting alone, day after day, in the heavy silence  of a cell--thinking of her children at home--thinking, thinking. Some  women go mad. Many suffer from shattered nerves for a long period after  release. It is impossible to believe that any woman ever emerged from  such a horror less criminal than when she entered it.    Two days of solitary confinement, broken each day by an hour of silent  exercise in a bitterly cold courtyard, and I was ordered to the  hospital. There I thought I should be a little more comfortable. The bed  was better, the food a little better, and small comforts, such as warm  water for washing, were allowed. I slept a little the first night. About  midnight I awoke, and sat up in bed, listening. A woman in the cell next  mine was moaning in long, sobbing breaths of mortal pain. She ceased for  a few minutes, then moaned again, horribly. The truth flashed over me,  turning me sick, as I realised that a life was coming into being, there  in that frightful prison. A woman, imprisoned by men's laws, was giving  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#16)"],[1,"point of view, merges in a  more fundamental objection. Undoubtedly the manner of asserting an  opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, and  may justly incur severe censure. But the principal offences of the kind  are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal,  to bring home to conviction. The gravest of them is, to argue  sophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements  of the case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion. But all this, even to  the most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good  faith, by persons who are not considered, and in many other respects may  not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely  possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the  misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law presume  to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct. With regard to  what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective,  sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons  would deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them  equally to both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employment  of them against the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing they  may not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to  obtain for him who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteous  indignation. Yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatest  when they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; and  whatever unfair advantage can be derived by any opinion from this mode  of asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions. The  worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to  stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men.  To calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are  peculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential,  and nobody but themselves feel much interest in seeing justice done  them; but this weapon is, from the nature of the case, denied to those  who attack a prevailing opinion: they can neither use it with safety to  themselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on their  own cause. In general, opinions contrary to those commonly received can  only obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the most  cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever  deviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured  vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really does  deter people from professing contrary opinions, and from listening to  those who profess them. For the interest, therefore, of truth and  justice, it is far more important to restrain this employment of  vituperative language than the other; and, for example, if it were  necessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourage  offensive attacks on infidelity, than on religion. It is, however,  obvious that law and authority have no business with restraining either,  while opinion ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by the  circumstances of the individual case; condemning every one, on whichever  side of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy either  want of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or intolerance of feeling  manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side which  a person takes, though it be the contrary side of the question to our  own: and giving merited honour to every one, whatever opinion he may  hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state what his opponents  and their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit,  keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in their  favour. This is the real morality of public discussion; and if often  violated, I am happy to think that there are many controversialists who  to a great extent observe it, and a still greater number who  conscientiously strive towards it.    FOOTNOTES:    [6] These words had scarcely been written, when, as if to give them an  emphatic contradiction, occurred the Government Press Prosecutions of  1858. That ill-judged interference with the liberty of public discussion  has not, however, induced me to alter a single word in the text, nor has  it at all weakened my conviction that, moments of panic excepted, the  era of pains and penalties for political discussion has, in our own  country, passed away. For, in the first place, the prosecutions were not  persisted in; and, in the second, they were never, properly speaking,  political prosecutions. The offence charged was not that of criticising  institutions, or the acts or persons of rulers, but of circulating what  was deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness of Tyrannicide.    If the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there ought  to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter  of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be  considered. It would, therefore, be irrelevant and out of place to  examine here, whether the doctrine of Tyrannicide deserves that title. I  shall content myself with saying, that the subject has been at all times  one of the open questions of morals; that the act of a private citizen  in striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above the law, has  placed himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or control, has been  accounted by whole nations, and by some of the best and wisest of men,  not a crime, but an act of exalted virtue; and that, right or wrong, it  is not of the nature of assassination, but of civil war. As such, I hold  that the instigation to it, in a specific case, may be a proper subject  of punishment, but only if an overt act has followed, and at least a  probable connection can be established between the act and the  instigation. Even then, it is not a foreign government, but the very  government assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, can  legitimately punish attacks directed against its own existence.

[10] Ample warning may be drawn from the large infusion of the passions  of a persecutor, which mingled with the general display of the worst  parts of our national character on the occasion of the Sepoy  insurrection. The ravings of fanatics or charlatans from the pulpit may  be unworthy of notice; but the heads of the Evangelical party have  announced as their principle, for the government of Hindoos and  Mahomedans, that no schools be supported by public money in which the  Bible is not taught, and by necessary consequence that no public  employment be given to any but real or pretended Christians. An  Under-Secretary of State, in a speech delivered to his constituents on  the 12th of November, 1857, is reported to have said: \"Toleration of  their faith\" (the faith of a hundred millions of British subjects), \"the  superstition which they called religion, by the British Government, had  had the effect of retarding the ascendency of the British name, and  preventing the salutary growth of Christianity.... Toleration was the  great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but do  not let them abuse that precious word toleration. As he understood it,  it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship, _among  Christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation_. It meant  toleration of all sects and denominations of _Christians who believed in  the one mediation_.\" I desire to call attention to the fact, that a man  who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this  country, under a liberal Ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who  do not believe in the divinity of Christ are beyond the pale of  toleration. Who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion  that religious persecution has passed away, never to return?          CHAPTER III.    OF INDIVIDUALITY, AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF WELL-BEING.      Such being the reasons which make it imperative that human beings should  be free to form opinions, and to express their opinions without reserve;  and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that  to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, or  asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the same  reasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their  opinions--to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either  physical or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own  risk and peril. This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one  pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary,  even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they  are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive  instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are  starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be  unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly  incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled  before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same  mob in the form of a placard. Acts, of whatever kind, which, without  justifiable cause, do harm to others, may be, and in the more important  cases absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavourable  sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of mankind.  The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make  himself a nuisance to other people. But if he refrains from molesting  others in what"]]]
