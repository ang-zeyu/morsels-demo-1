A very easy way of finding out if you have the correct attitude is to  place your toes against the bottom of the door. Now bring your chest  up to touch the door, and throw the lower part of the spine backward  so that there will be a space between the abdomen and the door. Place  the head erect, with the chin drawn in towards the neck, and you will  have very nearly the correct attitude. It may seem a little tiresome  at first, because you will be apt to hold yourself in position with  needless tension of muscles, but you will soon learn to relax the  unnecessary tension, and then you will find the position the most  comfortable possible. You can walk farther without fatigue, and stand  longer without backache, because the body is placed in the attitude in  which all parts occupy their designed relation to each other.    One very important fact is that in the wrong attitude the abdominal  organs crowd down into the pelvis, while in the correct position they  are supported and kept from sagging, so that the matter of a correct  attitude is not only a matter of beauty, but also of health.    In sitting, also, the most comfortable posture is the most healthful;  that is, with the body squarely placed on the seat, and equally  supported upon the pelvis--not leaning back against the chair, unless  the chair should chance to be so constructed that it supports the  lower part of the back and keeps the body erect.          CHAPTER XVII.    \"FEMALE DISEASES.\"      We hear a great deal in these days of \"female diseases,\" by which is  meant the displacements of the organs of the reproductive system; that  is, of the uterus, ovaries, etc. These displacements are many, for the  uterus may not only drop down out of place, but it may be tipped  towards one side or the other, to the front or the back; or it may be  bent upon itself in various directions. These different displacements  cause much pain, and often result in ulcerations and profuse  discharges which are known as the \"whites,\" or scientifically as  leucorrhea.    I only mention these things incidentally, so that I may call your  attention to the things you may do to prevent them.    A great many girls and women are spending large sums of money in being  doctored for these difficulties who need not suffer with them at all  if they had known how to dress healthfully; and many are bearing much  anxiety over the possibility of becoming sufferers with these  distressing diseases who could have their burden of fear removed by  the knowledge that \"female diseases,\" in the great majority of cases,  are the results of wrong habits of dress and life. Leucorrhea is not  a disease. It is a symptom of abnormal conditions, and to be cured it  is needful that the conditions shall be understood.    Dr. Kellogg says, \"Leucorrhea may result from simple congestion of the  bloodvessels of the vaginal mucous membrane, due to improper dress. It  may also be occasioned by taking cold, and by a debilitated condition  of the stomach.\"    Leucorrhea is merely an abnormal increase of a normal secretion. All  mucous membrane secretes mucus in small quantities--enough to keep the  membrane moist. When from any cause this secretion is increased, we  have what is called a catarrhal condition. As all cavities that  communicate with the air are lined with mucous membrane, this  catarrhal condition may exist in the nose, the throat, the eyes, the  ears, the bowels, or the reproductive organs, and will be named  according to the location.    A natural increase of this secretion takes place just before and after  menstruation, and should occasion no anxiety, but if continued during  the remainder of the month, especially if very profuse, of offensive  odor, or bloody in character, it needs the attention of the skilled  physician.    I do not wish to make you think constantly of yourself as diseased,  and so I do not give you directions as to local self-treatment. Many  symptoms can be overcome by general care of the health-habits of the  girl, and if they do not yield to this general care it is better to  consult a responsible physician than to tamper with yourself.    And here let me give you a word of warning. If you need medical care,  never consult the traveling doctors who advertise to do such wonderful  things. They charge big fees and give a little medicine and then move  on, and you have no redress if they have not accomplished all that  they have promised. They live off the gullibility of people. Again,  never take patent medicines. Wonderful discoveries, favorite  prescriptions and the like may be harmless, and they may not. And even  if they are, how can you judge that they are suited to your special  case? That they cured some one else is not proof that they will  benefit you, and you run a risk by taking them as an experiment. One  very serious danger in the taking of patent medicines is the fact that  they are so largely alcoholic in composition, and girls and women have  all too often been led into the alcohol habit and become habitual  drunkards through taking some advertised remedy.    Another has correctly said: \"If you need the consultation and advice  of a physician go to your family physician, or, if you prefer, go to  some other physician; but always select one whose moral character and  acknowledged ability render him a suitable and safe adviser in such a  time of need. Above all things avoid quacks. The policy they pursue is  to frighten you, to work upon your imagination, and to make such  alarming and unreliable statements as will induce you to purchase  their nostrums and subject yourself to such a series of humiliations  and impositions as will enable them to pilfer your purse and without  rendering you in return any value received, but likely leave you in a  much worse condition than they found you.\"    You will probably be advised by your personal friends, who may know of  your ailments, to take hot douches, and perhaps you may wonder why I  do not prescribe them for leucorrhea, and kindred difficulties.    I do not commend them for the fact that I do not want you to be  turning your constantly anxious thought towards yourself in these  matters. If you need such treatment, let it be prescribed by your  physician, who knows exactly your condition. As far as possible turn  your thoughts from the reproductive system. Take care of your general  health, dress properly, obey all the rules of hygiene in regard to  diet, sleep, bathing, special cleanliness, and care, and then forget  as far as possible the physical facts of womanhood.    An excellent addition to your general bathing can be taken once a week  in the form of a sitz bath, which is effective for cleanliness, and  also for the reduction of congestion. If you have no sitz bath-tub,  an ordinary wash-tub can be made to answer by raising one side an inch  or two by means of some support. Have the water at a comfortable  temperature, say about 98 degrees, and if you have no thermometer you  can gauge the heat by putting in three gallons of cold water and add  one gallon of boiling water. Sit down in the tub and cover yourself  with a blanket. In about ten minutes add by degrees a gallon of cold  water. Remain sitting a minute or two longer, then rub dry.    Many people are afraid to use cold water after hot, in bathing, for  fear they will take cold, but that is just the way to prevent such a  result from the hot bath. The hot water has caused all the pores on  the surface of the body to open, and the bodily heat is rapidly lost  through this cause. The cold water, quickly applied, causes the pores  to close, leaves the skin in a tonic condition, and conserves the  bodily heat. One should never take a hot bath without following it  with a _quick_ cold application to the surface. It should continue,  however, but for a moment.    This kind of a bath is very useful for all chronic congestions of the  abdominal and pelvic viscera, such as piles, constipation, painful  menstruation, leucorrhea, or other affections of the reproductive  organs. It is also very helpful in headaches due to congestion of the  brain. If there is too little blood in the brain it might produce  wakefulness, but when the brain is too full of blood this bath tends  to produce sound and refreshing sleep.    A foot bath may be taken at the same time as the sitz bath, and in  this case the water should be warmer than that in the sitz bath, and  as the person rises from the sitz bath she should step into it, so  that her feet will get the tonic effect of the cold water.    The average age at which menstruation first appears is fourteen, but  some girls menstruate as early as eleven, while others may not develop  till some years later. Frequently, when the girl does not manifest  this symptom of womanly development, the mother becomes anxious and  begins to give forcing medicines. She knows that girls often die with  consumption in their early young womanhood, and has heard that it was  because they did not physically develop, and she fears that such  danger threatens her daughter, and imagines that if something can be  done to \"bring on her courses,\" as she expresses it, the danger will  be averted.    In this case she has reversed cause and effect. The consumptive girl  did not menstruate because she had not the vitality to do so. The  consumption was the cause, the non-menstruation the effect. To produce  hemorrhage from the reproductive system by strong, forcing medicines  is only to increase the danger. The only thing to do is to improve the  general health, and if the girl can increase in strength until she  has more vital force than suffices to keep her alive, the function  that is vital--not to her, but to the race--will establish itself.    The failure of the menses to appear at the average age may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#16)"],[1," thither. She also wished it might be in their power to supply the wants  he came about.    5. But Jacob was quite overcome, not so much by their kindred, nor by  that affection which might arise thence, as by his love to the damsel,  and his surprise at her beauty, which was so flourishing, as few of the  women of that age could vie with. He said then, \"There is a relation  between thee and me, elder than either thy or my birth, if thou be the  daughter of Laban; for Abraham was the son of Terah, as well as Haran  and Nahor. Of the last of whom [Nahor] Bethuel thy grandfather was the  son. Isaac my father was the son of Abraham and of Sarah, who was the  daughter of Haran. But there is a nearer and later cement of mutual  kindred which we bear to one another, for my mother Rebeka was sister to  Laban thy father, both by the same father and mother; I therefore and  thou are cousin-germans. And I am now come to salute you, and to renew  that affinity which is proper between us.\" Upon this the damsel, at the  mention of Rebeka, as usually happens to young persons, wept, and that  out of the kindness she had for her father, and embraced Jacob, she  having learned an account of Rebeka from her father, and knew that her  parents loved to hear her named; and when she had saluted him, she said  that \"he brought the most desirable and greatest pleasures to her  father, with all their family, who was always mentioning his mother, and  always thinking of her, and her alone; and that this will make thee  equal in his eyes to any advantageous circumstances whatsoever.\" Then  she bid him go to her father, and follow her while she conducted him to  him; and not to deprive him of such a pleasure, by staying any longer  away from him.    6. When she had said thus, she brought him to Laban; and being owned by  his uncle, he was secure himself, as being among his friends; and he  brought a great deal of pleasure to them by his unexpected coning. But a  little while afterward, Laban told him that he could not express in  words the joy he had at his coming; but still he inquired of him the  occasion of his coming, and why he left his aged mother and father, when  they wanted to be taken care of by him; and that he would afford him all  the assistance he wanted. Then Jacob gave him an account of the whole  occasion of his journey, and told him, \"that Isaac had two sons that  were twins, himself and Esau; who, because he failed of his father's  prayers, which by his mother's wisdom were put up for him, sought to  kill him, as deprived of the kingdom 34 which was to be given him of  God, and of the blessings for which their father prayed; and that this  was the occasion of his coming hither, as his mother had commanded him  to do: for we are all [says he] brethren one to another; but our mother  esteems an alliance with your family more than she does one with the  families of the country; so I look upon yourself and God to be the  supporters of my travels, and think myself safe in my present  circumstances.\"    7. Now Laban promised to treat him with great humanity, both on account  of his ancestors, and particularly for the sake of his mother, towards  whom, he said, he would show his kindness, even though she were absent,  by taking care of him; for he assured him he would make him the head  shepherd of his flock, and give him authority sufficient for that  purpose; and when he should have a mind to return to his parents, he  would send him back with presents, and this in as honorable a manner as  the nearness of their relation should require. This Jacob heard gladly;  and said he would willingly, and with pleasure, undergo any sort of  pains while he tarried with him, but desired Rachel to wife, as the  reward of those pains, who was not only on other accounts esteemed by  him, but also because she was the means of his coming to him; for he  said he was forced by the love of the damsel to make this proposal.  Laban was well pleased with this agreement, and consented to give the  damsel to him, as not desirous to meet with any better son-in-law; and  said he would do this, if he would stay with him some time, for he was  not willing to send his daughter to be among the Canaanites, for he  repented of the alliance he had made already by marrying his sister  there. And when Jacob had given his consent to this, he agreed to stay  seven years; for so many years he had resolved to serve his father-in-  law, that, having given a specimen of his virtue, it might be better  known what sort of a man he was. And Jacob, accepting of his terms,  after the time was over, he made the wedding-feast; and when it was  night, without Jacob's perceiving it, he put his other daughter into bed  to him, who was both elder than Rachel, and of no comely countenance:  Jacob lay with her that night, as being both in drink and in the dark.  However, when it was day, he knew what had been done to him; and he  reproached Laban for his unfair proceeding with him; who asked pardon  for that necessity which forced him to do what he did; for he did not  give him Lea out of any ill design, but as overcome by another greater  necessity: that, notwithstanding this, nothing should hinder him from  marrying Rachel; but that when he had served another seven years, he  would give him her whom he loved. Jacob submitted to this condition, for  his love to the damsel did not permit him to do otherwise; and when  another seven years were gone, he took Rachel to wife.    8. Now each of these had handmaids, by their father's donation. Zilpha  was handmaid to Lea, and Bilha to Rachel; by no means slaves, 35 but  however subject to their mistresses. Now Lea was sorely troubled at her  husband's love to her sister; and she expected she should be better  esteemed if she bare him children: so she entreated God perpetually; and  when she had borne a son, and her husband was on that account better  reconciled to her, she named her son Reubel, because God had had mercy  upon her, in giving her a son, for that is the signification of this  name. After some time she bare three more sons; Simeon, which name  signifies that God had hearkened to her prayer. Then she bare Levi, the  confirmer of their friendship. After him was born Judah, which denotes  thanksgiving. But Rachel, fearing lest the fruitfulness of her sister  should make herself enjoy a lesser share of Jacob's affections, put to  bed to him her handmaid Bilha; by whom Jacob had Dan: one may interpret  that name into the Greek tongue, a divine judgment. And after him  Nephthalim, as it were, unconquerable in stratagems, since Rachel tried  to conquer the fruitfulness of her sister by this stratagem.  Accordingly, Lea took the same method, and used a counter-stratagem to  that of her sister; for she put to bed to him her own handmaid. Jacob  therefore had by Zilpha a son, whose name was Gad, which may be  interpreted fortune; and after him Asher, which may be called a happy  man, because he added glory to Lea. Now Reubel, the eldest son of Lea,  brought apples of mandrakes 36 to his mother. When Rachel saw them, she  desired that she would give her the apples, for she longed to eat them;  but when she refused, and bid her be content that she had deprived her  of the benevolence she ought to have had from her husband, Rachel, in  order to mitigate her sister's anger, said she would yield her husband  to her; and he should lie with her that evening. She accepted of the  favor, and Jacob slept with Lea, by the favor of Rachel. She bare then  these sons: Issachar, denoting one born by hire: and Zabulon, one born  as a pledge of benevolence towards her; and a daughter, Dina. After some  time Rachel had a son, named Joseph, which signified there should be  another added to him.    9. Now Jacob fed the flocks of Laban his father-in-law all this time,  being twenty years, after which he desired leave of his father-in-law to  take his wives and go home; but when his father-in-law would not give  him leave, he contrived to do it secretly. He made trial therefore of  the disposition of his wives what they thought of this journey;when  they appeared glad, and approved of it. Rachel took along with her the  images of the gods, which, according to their laws, they used to worship  in their own country, and ran away together with her sister. The  children also of them both, and the handmaids, and what possessions they  had, went along with them. Jacob also drove away half the cattle,  without letting Laban know of it beforehand But the reason why Rachel  took the images of the gods, although Jacob had taught her to despise  such worship of those gods, was this, That in case they were pursued,  and taken by her father, she might have recourse to these images, in  order to obtain his pardon.    10. But Laban, after one day's time, being acquainted with Jacob's and  his daughters' departure, was much troubled, and pursued after them,  leading a band of men with him; and on the seventh day overtook them,  and found them resting on a certain hill; and then indeed he did not  meddle with them, for it was even-tide; but God stood by him in a dream,  and warned him to receive his son-in-law and his daughters in a  peaceable manner; and not to venture upon any thing rashly, or in wrath  to but to make a league with Jacob. And he told him, that if he despised  their small number, attacked them in a hostile manner, he would assist  them. When Laban had been thus forewarned by God, he called Jacob to him  the next day, in order to treat with him, and showed him what dream he  had; in dependence whereupon he came confidently to him, and began to  accuse him, alleging that he had entertained him when he was poor, and  in want of all things, and had given him plenty of all things which he  had. \"For,\" said he, \"I have joined my daughters to thee in marriage,  and supposed that thy kindness to me be greater than before; but thou  hast had no regard to"]]]
