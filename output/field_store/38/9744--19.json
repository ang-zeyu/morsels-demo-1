It is only with the greatest of resolution, fortified by lack of time  and space, that I have kept myself to the main lines of his career, and  refrained from following him into by-paths and secret, pleasant places;  but I shall not be denied just one indulgence. In the great days when  Lord Grey was Governor-General he formed a party to visit Prince Edward  Island. The route was a circuitous one. It began at Ottawa; it extended  to Winnipeg, down the Nelson River to York Factory, across Hudson Bay,  down the Strait, by Belle Isle and Newfoundland, and across the Gulf  of St. Lawrence to a place called Orwell. Lord Grey in the matter of  company had the reputation of doing himself well. John McCrae was of the  party. It also included John Macnaughton, L. S. Amery, Lord Percy, Lord  Lanesborough, and one or two others. The ship had called at North Sydney  where Lady Grey and the Lady Evelyn joined.    Through the place in a deep ravine runs an innocent stream which  broadens out into still pools, dark under the alders. There was a rod--a  very beautiful rod in two pieces. It excited his suspicion. It was put  into his hand, the first stranger hand that ever held it; and the first  cast showed that it was a worthy hand. The sea-trout were running that  afternoon. Thirty years before, in that memorable visit to Scotland,  he had been taken aside by \"an old friend of his grandfather's\". It was  there he learned \"to love the trooties\". The love and the art never left  him. It was at this same Orwell his brother first heard the world called  to arms on that early August morning in 1914.    In those civil years there were, of course, diversions: visits to the  United States and meetings with notable men--Welch, Futcher, Hurd,  White, Howard, Barker: voyages to Europe with a detailed itinerary upon  the record; walks and rides upon the mountain; excursion in winter to  the woods, and in summer to the lakes; and one visit to the Packards  in Maine, with the sea enthusiastically described. Upon those woodland  excursions and upon many other adventures his companion is often  referred to as \"Billy T.\", who can be no other than Lieut.-Col. W. G.  Turner, \"M.C.\"    Much is left out of the diary that we would wish to have recorded.  There is tantalizing mention of \"conversations\" with Shepherd--with  Roddick--with Chipman--with Armstrong--with Gardner--with Martin--with  Moyse. Occasionally there is a note of description: \"James Mavor is a  kindly genius with much knowledge\"; \"Tait McKenzie presided ideally\" at  a Shakespeare dinner; \"Stephen Leacock does not keep all the good things  for his publisher.\" Those who know the life in Montreal may well for  themselves supply the details.          IX. Dead in His Prime      John McCrae left the front after the second battle of Ypres, and never  returned. On June 1st, 1915, he was posted to No. 3 General Hospital  at Boulogne, a most efficient unit organized by McGill University and  commanded by that fine soldier Colonel H. S. Birkett, C.B. He was placed  in charge of medicine, with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel as from April  17th, 1915, and there he remained until his death.    At first he did not relish the change. His heart was with the guns. He  had transferred from the artillery to the medical service as recently  as the previous autumn, and embarked a few days afterwards at Quebec,  on the 29th of September, arriving at Davenport, October 20th, 1914.  Although he was attached as Medical Officer to the 1st Brigade of  Artillery, he could not forget that he was no longer a gunner, and in  those tumultuous days he was often to be found in the observation post  rather than in his dressing station. He had inherited something of  the old army superciliousness towards a \"non-combatant\" service, being  unaware that in this war the battle casualties in the medical corps were  to be higher than in any other arm of the service. From South Africa he  wrote exactly fifteen years before: \"I am glad that I am not 'a medical'  out here. No 'R.A.M.C.' or any other 'M.C.' for me. There is a big  breach, and the medicals are on the far side of it.\" On August 7th,  1915, he writes from his hospital post, \"I expect to wish often that I  had stuck by the artillery.\" But he had no choice.    Of this period of his service there is little written record. He merely  did his work, and did it well, as he always did what his mind found to  do. His health was failing. He suffered from the cold. A year before his  death he writes on January 25th, 1917:      The cruel cold is still holding. Everyone is suffering, and the men  in the wards in bed cannot keep warm. I know of nothing so absolutely  pitiless as weather. Let one wish; let one pray; do what one will; still  the same clear sky and no sign,--you know the cold brand of sunshine.  For my own part I do not think I have ever been more uncomfortable.  Everything is so cold that it hurts to pick it up. To go to bed is a  nightmare and to get up a worse one. I have heard of cold weather in  Europe, and how the poor suffer,--now I know!      All his life he was a victim of asthma. The first definite attack was  in the autumn of 1894, and the following winter it recurred with  persistence. For the next five years his letters abound in references  to the malady. After coming to Montreal it subsided; but he always felt  that the enemy was around the corner. He had frequent periods in bed;  but he enjoyed the relief from work and the occasion they afforded for  rest and reading.    In January, 1918, minutes begin to appear upon his official file  which were of great interest to him, and to us. Colonel Birkett had  relinquished command of the unit to resume his duties as Dean of the  Medical Faculty of McGill University. He was succeeded by that veteran  soldier, Colonel J. M. Elder, C.M.G. At the same time the command of No.  1 General Hospital fell vacant. Lieut.-Colonel McCrae was required  for that post; but a higher honour was in store, namely the place of  Consultant to the British Armies in the Field. All these events, and  the final great event, are best recorded in the austere official  correspondence which I am permitted to extract from the files:          From D.M.S. Canadian Contingents.  (Major-General C. L. Foster, C.B.).      To O.C. No. 3 General Hospital, B.E.F., 13th December, 1917:      There is a probability of the command of No. 1 General Hospital      becoming vacant.  It is requested, please, that you obtain      from Lieut.-Col. J. McCrae his wishes in the matter.  If he is available,      and willing to take over this command, it is proposed to offer it to him.          O.C. No. 3 General Hospital, B.E.F., To D.M.S. Canadian Contingents,      28th December, 1917:  Lieut.-Colonel McCrae desires me to say that,      while he naturally looks forward to succeeding to the command      of this unit, he is quite willing to comply with your desire,      and will take command of No. 1 General Hospital at any time you may wish.          D.G.M.S. British Armies in France.  To D.M.S. Canadian Contingents,      January 2nd, 1918:  It is proposed to appoint Lieut.-Colonel J. McCrae,      now serving with No. 3 Canadian General Hospital, Consulting Physician      to the British Armies in France.  Notification of this appointment,      when made, will be sent to you in due course.          D.M.S. Canadian Contingents.  To O.C. No. 3 General Hospital, B.E.F.,      January 5th, 1918:  Since receiving your letter I have information      from G.H.Q. that they will appoint a Consultant Physician      to the British Armies in the Field, and have indicated their desire      for Lieut.-Colonel McCrae for this duty.  This is a much higher honour      than commanding a General Hospital, and I hope he will take the post,      as this is a position I have long wished should be filled      by a C.A.M.C. officer.          D.M.S. Canadian Contingents.  To D.G.M.S., G.H.Q., 2nd Echelon,      January 15th, 1918:  I fully concur in this appointment, and consider      this officer will prove his ability as an able Consulting Physician.          Telegram:  D.G.M.S., G.H.Q., 2nd Echelon.  To D.M.S. Canadian Contingents,      January 18th, 1918:  Any objection to Lieut.-Col. J. McCrae      being appointed Consulting Physician to British Armies in France.      If appointed, temporary rank of Colonel recommended.          Telegram:  O.C. No. 3 General Hospital, B.E.F.  To D.M.S.      Canadian Contingents, January 27th, 1918:  Lieut.-Col. John McCrae      seriously ill with pneumonia at No. 14 General Hospital.          Telegram:  O.C. No. 14 General Hospital.  To O.C. No. 3 General Hospital,      B.E.F., January 28th, 1918:  Lieut.-Col. John McCrae died this morning.      This was the end. For him the war was finished and all the glory of the  world had passed.    Henceforth we are concerned not with the letters he wrote, but with  the letters which were written about him. They came from all quarters,  literally in hundreds, all inspired by pure sympathy, but some tinged  with a curiosity which it is hoped this writing will do something to  assuage.    Let us first confine ourselves to the facts. They are all contained in a  letter which Colonel Elder wrote to myself in common with other friends.  On Wednesday, January 23rd, he was as usual in the morning; but in the  afternoon Colonel Elder found him asleep in his chair in the mess room.  \"I have a slight headache,\" he said. He went to his quarters. In  the evening he was worse, but had no increase of temperature, no  acceleration of pulse or respiration. At this moment the order arrived  for him to proceed forthwith as Consulting Physician of the First Army.  Colonel Elder writes, \"I read the order to him, and told him I should  announce the contents at mess. He was very much pleased over the  appointment. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#16)"],[1,"to keep the gossips out,\" Doctor Barnes said  gravely, \"she's too sensitive, Miss Grant I mean, to hear unfeeling or  curious discussions of the case. But a friend who is in sympathy--that's  another thing. She'll be better with such company than alone.\"    When Brierly had set out, the detective threw away his after-dinner  cigar.    \"Were you called to see the little lady who was taken ill here  yesterday, after the close of the inquest?\" he asked carelessly. \"I  forgot to inquire, in my desire to keep Brierly occupied.\"    The doctor shook his head. \"I fancy she only needed time to recover  from the effect of her gruesome position. It was a blunder, putting her  in plain sight of that shrouded corpse. Those little blue-eyed women are  masses of nerves and fine sensibilities--often. I don't see how it came  about.\"    \"If you mean the 'blunder' of putting those ladies where they were, it  was I who blundered. I arranged to place them there.\"    \"You!\" the doctor's eyes opened wide in astonishment. \"Then I retract.  It was I who have blundered.\"    \"Um--I am not so sure,\" Ferrars replied slowly, and then the subject as  by mutual consent was ignored between them. Ferrars, who seemed for the  time at least to have done his thinking, wrote several letters at the  doctor's desk, and then prepared to go out.    \"I asked permission to call and inquire after Mrs. Jamieson's health,  yesterday,\" he said to the doctor, \"and as she has not required your  services she may be able to receive me now.\"    \"There is another Esculapius in Glenville,\" reminded Doctor Barnes.    \"So I have heard; but the lady is a person of good taste. She would have  called you in if any one.\" He bowed and went out with a gleam of humour  in his eyes.    \"It's sometimes hard to guess what Ferrars means when he speaks with  that queer look and tone,\" mused the doctor. \"And who would have thought  he would care or think of a formal call like this just now! And yet,  that little woman is pretty enough to attract a man, I'm sure; and a  detective may be as susceptible, I suppose, as another.\"    Ferrars waited for a few moments in the reception-room of the Glenville  House, and was then conducted to the pretty suite occupied by Mrs.  Jamieson. He found her half reclining in a long, low chair, with her  friend, Mrs. Arthur, still in attendance. She wore a soft, loose robe of  black, with billowy gauze-like ruffles, and floating ribbons of the same  sable hue, relieved only by a knot of purple wood violets at her throat.  Her face was very pale and her eyes, with their changing lights of  greyish green and glinting blue, looking larger and deeper than usual  because of the dark shadows beneath them, and the waves of her plentiful  fair hair falling low and loose upon her forehead.    She welcomed her visitor with a faint half smile, and thanked him again  for his kindness of the previous day. She blamed herself for her want of  nerve and courage. She inquired after Miss Grant and expressed her  sympathy for the bereaved girl, and her desire to see her again, to  know her, and serve her if possible; she had shown herself so brave, yet  so womanly that day--and then the little lady told of her encounter with  Miss Grant in the unfortunate character of messenger or bearer of bad  news. She was glad there would be no lack of staunch friends to support  the sweet girl in her time of need and trouble, and she finished by  sending a pretty message to Hilda, and then without further question or  comment concerning the murder or the progress of the case, she let the  talk slip into the hands of her friend, and leaned back in her chair  like one too weak for further effort, seeing which Ferrars soon  withdrew.    \"You will not consider this an example of my usual hospitality, I  trust,\" Mrs. Jamieson said, as he bent over her chair to say farewell.  \"I fear I was not wise in refusing to let them call a physician, but I  do dread being in the hands of a doctor. I shall be pleased to hear how  this sad case progresses, Mr. Grant, and by the bye, has anything new  occurred since the inquest? Any new witnesses or discoveries of any  sort?\"    But Ferrars shook his head, and murmuring something about time being  short, and not taxing her good nature and strength further, he bowed  low, and went away.    \"It's very good of her,\" he mused, as he went, \"to take such kindly  interest in my supposed relative, Miss Grant. But she certainly showed  scant interest in the chief actor in the drama, my friend Brierly.\"    The candles had just been lighted that evening, and Ferrars was once  more waiting at the doctor's desk, while Brierly, pale and heavy-eyed,  lounged by the long window near, when Dr. Barnes came in, hat in hand.    \"As you felt some interest in Mrs. Jamieson's selection of a physician  this morning,\" the latter said, \"I will inform you that I have just been  summoned to see that lady, professionally, of course,\" he added, as if  by an afterthought, and smiling slightly.    \"Thank you. Mrs. Jamieson has vindicated my belief in her good  judgment,\" replied Ferrars, and then he wheeled about in his chair, and  put out a detaining hand.    \"Don't think I doubt your reserve, doctor,\" he went on, \"when I ask you  to avoid or evade, if needful, any discussion of this affair of ours.  That is, avoid giving any information, be it ever so trivial.\" He shot a  quick glance toward Brierly, and met the doctor's eye for one swift,  momentary glance.    \"My visit will be purely professional, and doubtless brief,\" was the  reply, as the speaker passed from the room, and Ferrars smiled, knowing  that his friend understood the meaning behind the half jesting words.    A moment later Robert Brierly arose, yawned, and crossed the room to  take up his hat.    \"This inaction is horrible,\" he said, drearily. \"I must get out. I wish  I had walked down with Barnes. Won't you come out with me, Mr. Ferrars?\"    The detective dipped his pen in the sand-box, and arose quickly. Then  when he had found his hat, and had lowered the light over the writing  table, he put a hand upon the other's shoulder.    \"I'll go out with you, of course, Brierly,\" he said, and there was a  world of sympathy, as well as complete understanding in his tone. \"But  first, I want to ask you to show yourself as little as possible upon the  streets, for a few days to come at least, and then only in the company  of the doctor or myself, and not to go out evenings at all unless  similarly attended. It will be irksome, I know, but I believe it  important, and I must ask this of you, too, without explanation, for the  present at least.\"    The young man looked at him for a moment, earnestly and in silence.    \"Do you ask this for reasons personal to myself, or because it seems to  you to be for the interest of the investigation?\" he asked slowly.    Ferrars smiled. \"You're as able to take care of yourself as any man I  know, Brierly,\" he said, with frank conviction. \"It's for the interest  of the case that we--and especially you--keep ourselves as much aloof as  possible from questions and curiosity. There is another reason which I  cannot give just yet.\"    \"As you will. I have put myself and my brother's vindication in your  hands, Mr. Ferrars, and I shall do nothing, be sure, to hinder your  progress.\" As they passed out Brierly paused under the shadow of the  porch. \"May I ask if you have put the same embargo upon Miss Grant?\" he  questioned.    \"I have, yes. Glenville must know what we wish it to know, and not a  syllable more.\"    \"Ah! I like that.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because it sounds as if you had really found the end of your thread  here.\"    \"Oh, yes. The beginning is here. Not of the case, mind; only of the  clues. But heaven only knows where it may lead us before we find the  end.\"    \"What matters,\" said the brother of Charles Brierly, with a heavy sigh,  \"so long as it brings us to the truth!\"          CHAPTER XII.    \"FERRISS-GRANT.\"      On the fourth day after Charles Brierly's untimely death, his body was  taken to the city and laid beside his parents in the beautiful cemetery  where love and grief had already prepared for him and his, a place of  final rest.    News of the burial had been sent ahead, and a crowd of friends had  assembled at the home of their father's oldest friend and family lawyer,  where the body was received as that of a son, and the last rites of  affection and respect were performed by the venerable rector who had  seen the brothers grow from boys to men.    Doctor Barnes and Hilda Grant, with Mrs. Marcy as chaperone, accompanied  the sad-hearted brother upon this journey, and they were somewhat  surprised when Ferrars, whom they had thought must go with them in his  character of sole relative to the young lady, explained that his  presence in Glenville just then was essential to the success of the work  he had been called there to do.    \"There are so many little things which I want to learn,\" he said. \"In  fact, I must know Glenville much better before I can go far in my  search, and during your absence I can find the time for making many new  acquaintances, and I mean to begin by cultivating your friend Doran,  doctor.\"    They were gone three days, and when they returned they were but a party  of three. \"Poor Charlie Brierly,\" as his friends in the city had already  begun to call the dead, lay in his last, quiet earthly home, and Robert  had remained in the city.    \"To settle up his brother's affairs, and put the matter of his death  into the hands of the detectives.\" At least this is what Mr. Doran  informed one of the loungers who, seeing the return of the doctor and  the two ladies, had remarked upon Brierly's absence.    \"Of course he'll have to come back here,\" Doran had further added. \"He  ain't touched the things in his brother's rooms yet, they say. But  they'll wait better than the other business.\"    \"Umph!\" the villager sniffed. \"He's let three days slip"]]]
