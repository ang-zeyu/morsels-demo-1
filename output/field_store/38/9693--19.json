About the other part, the locusts, or, not  to put too fine a point on it, the grasshoppers, as much cannot be said,  though they were among the creeping and leaping things the children  of Israel were permitted to eat. They were probably not eaten raw, but  roasted in that most primitive of ovens, a hole in the ground made hot  by building a fire in it. The locusts and honey may have been served  together, as the Bedas of Ceylon are said to season their meat with  honey. At any rate, as the locust is often a great plague in Palestine,  the prophet in eating them found his account in the general weal, and  in the profit of the pastoral bees; the fewer locusts, the more flowers.  Owing to its numerous wild-flowers and flowering shrubs, Palestine  has always been a famous country for bees. They deposit their honey in  hollow trees as our bees do when they escape from the hive, and in holes  in the rocks as ours do not. In a tropical or semi-tropical climate  bees are quite apt to take refuge in the rocks, but where ice and snow  prevail, as with us, they are much safer high up in the trunk of a  forest tree.    The best honey is the product of the milder parts of the temperate zone.  There are too many rank and poisonous plants in the tropics. Honey from  certain districts of Turkey produces headache and vomiting, and that  from Brazil is used chiefly as medicine. The honey of Mount Hymettus  owes its fine quality to wild thyme. The best honey in Persia and in  Florida is collected from the orange blossom. The celebrated honey of  Narbonne in the south of France is obtained from a species of rosemary.  In Scotland good honey is made from the blossoming heather.    California honey is white and delicate and highly perfumed, and now  takes the lead in the market. But honey is honey the world over; and the  bee is the bee still. \"Men may degenerate,\" says an old traveler, \"may  forget the arts by which they acquired renown; manufactories may fail,  and commodities be debased, but the sweets of the wild-flowers of the  wilderness, the industry and natural mechanics of the bee, will continue  without change or derogation.\"          II. SHARP EYES AND OTHER PAPERS        CONTENTS    SHARP EYES    THE APPLE    A TASTE OF MAINE BIRCH    WINTER NEIGHBORS    NOTES BY THE WAY.        I. The Weather-wise Muskrat     II. Cheating the Squirrels    III. Fox and Hound     IV. The Woodchuck          SHARP EYES.      Noting how one eye seconds and reinforces the other, I have often amused  myself by wondering what the effect would be if one could go on opening  eye after eye to the number say of a dozen or more. What would he see?  Perhaps not the invisible--not the odors of flowers nor the fever  germs in the air--not the infinitely small of the microscope nor the  infinitely distant of the telescope. This would require, not more eyes  so much as an eye constructed with more and different lenses; but would  he not see with augmented power within the natural limits of vision? At  any rate some persons seem to have opened more eyes than others, they  see with such force and distinctness; their vision penetrates the  tangle and obscurity where that of others fails like a spent or impotent  bullet. How many eyes did Gilbert White open? how many did Henry  Thoreau? how many did Audubon? how many does the hunter, matching his  sight against the keen and alert sense of a deer or a moose, or a fox  or a wolf? Not outward eyes, but inward. We open another eye whenever we  see beyond the first general features or outlines of things--whenever  we grasp the special details and characteristic markings that this mask  covers. Science confers new powers of vision.    Whenever you have learned to discriminate the birds, or the plants, or  the geological features of a country, it is as if new and keener eyes  were added.    Of course one must not only see sharply, but read aright what he sees.  The facts in the life of Nature that are transpiring about us are like  written words that the observer is to arrange into sentences. Or the  writing is in cipher and he must furnish the key. A female oriole was  one day observed very much preoccupied under a shed where the refuse  from the horse stable was thrown. She hopped about among the barn fowls,  scolding them sharply when they came too near her. The stable, dark  and cavernous, was just beyond. The bird, not finding what she wanted  outside, boldly ventured into the stable, and was presently captured by  the farmer. What did she want? was the query. What, but a horsehair  for her nest which was in an apple-tree near by; and she was so bent on  having one that I have no doubt she would have tweaked one out of the  horse's tail had he been in the stable. Later in the season I examined  her nest and found it sewed through and through with several long horse  hairs, so that the bird persisted in her search till the hair was found.    Little dramas and tragedies and comedies, little characteristic scenes,  are always being enacted in the lives of the birds, if our eyes are  sharp enough to see them. Some clever observer saw this little comedy  played among some English sparrows and wrote an account of it in his  newspaper; it is too good not to be true: A male bird brought to his  box a large, fine goose feather, which is a great find for a sparrow  and much coveted. After he had deposited his prize and chattered his  gratulations over it he went away in quest of his mate. His next-door  neighbor, a female bird, seeing her chance, quickly slipped in and  seized the feather,--and here the wit of the bird came out, for instead  of carrying it into her own box she flew with it to a near tree and  hid it in a fork of the branches, then went home, and when her neighbor  returned with his mate was innocently employed about her own affairs.  The proud male, finding his feather gone, came out of his box in a high  state of excitement, and, with wrath in his manner and accusation on  his tongue, rushed into the cot of the female. Not finding his goods and  chattels there as he had expected, he stormed around a while, abusing  everybody in general and his neighbor in particular, and then went away  as if to repair the loss. As soon as he was out of sight, the shrewd  thief went and brought the feather home and lined her own domicile with  it.    I was much amused one summer day in seeing a bluebird feeding her young  one in the shaded street of a large town. She had captured a cicada or  harvest-fly, and after bruising it a while on the ground flew with it  to a tree and placed it in the beak of the young bird. It was a large  morsel, and the mother seemed to have doubts of her chick's ability to  dispose of it, for she stood near and watched its efforts with great  solicitude. The young bird struggled valiantly with the cicada, but made  no head way in swallowing it, when the mother took it from him and flew  to the sidewalk, and proceeded to break and bruise it more thoroughly.  Then she again placed it in his beak, and seemed to say, \"There, try it  now,\" and sympathized so thoroughly with his efforts that she repeated  many of his motions and contortions. But the great fly was unyielding,  and, indeed, seemed ridiculously disproportioned to the beak that held  it. The young bird fluttered and fluttered and screamed, \"I'm stuck, I'm  stuck,\" till the anxious parent again seized the morsel and carried  it to an iron railing, where she came down upon it for the space of a  minute with all the force and momentum her beak could command. Then  she offered it to her young a third time, but with the same result as  before, except that this time the bird dropped it; but she was at the  ground as soon as the cicada was, and taking it in her beak flew  some distance to a high board fence where she sat motionless for some  moments. While pondering the problem how that fly should be broken,  the male bluebird approached her, and said very plainly, and I thought  rather curtly, \"Give me that bug,\" but she quickly resented his  interference and flew farther away, where she sat apparently quite  discouraged when I last saw her.    The bluebird is a home bird, and I am never tired of recurring to him.  His coming or reappearance in the spring marks a new chapter in the  progress of the season; things are never quite the same after one has  heard that note. The past spring the males came about a week in advance  of the females. A fine male lingered about my grounds and orchard all  the time, apparently waiting the arrival of his mate. He called and  warbled every day, as if he felt sure she was within ear-shot, and  could be hurried up. Now he warbled half-angrily or upbraidingly,  then coaxingly, then cheerily and confidently, the next moment in a  plaintive, far-away manner. He would half open his wings, and twinkle  them caressingly, as if beckoning his mate to his heart. One morning she  had come, but was shy and reserved. The fond male flew to a knot-hole  in an old apple-tree, and coaxed her to his side. I heard a fine  confidential warble,--the old, old story. But the female flew to a near  tree, and uttered her plaintive, homesick note. The male went and got  some dry grass or bark in his beak, and flew again to the hole in the  old tree, and promised unremitting devotion, but the other said \"nay,\"  and flew away in the distance. When he saw her going, or rather heard  her distant note, he dropped his stuff, and cried out in a tone that  said plainly enough, \"Wait a minute. One word, please,\" and flew swiftly  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#16)"],[1,"harmony as they revolve in their spheres.\"    [Sidenote: _Songs for the children_]    There are songs about the birds' nests, always pleasing to the little  folks, and doubly so when they have held in their own hands the  wonderful bit of weaving, so strong and yet so soft, woven by the  mother-bird for the baby-birds. Mrs. Spider is also very interesting  with her lace-like webs which are to be found even in well-regulated  schoolrooms, and the songs of the bleating sheep who give us their wool  fill every little heart with delight. Miss Poulsson's Finger Play, \"The  Lambs,\" gives the restless fingers something to do and the \"eight white  sheep all fast asleep\" afford a chance for a good laugh over the \"two  old dogs close by\" (the thumbs). One has the opportunity, too, of  noticing whether the eight white sheep on the tiny hands are really  _white_ enough to do the weaving. A smiling allusion to some small  _black_ sheep will bring them back clean for the next session.    [Sidenote: _A weaving game_]    The following weaving game can be played in several ways. This extract  is from the \"Kindergarten Guide,\" by Lois Bates: \"Six children stand in  a row; a tall one at each end for the border of the mat and the other  four representing the strips. The child who is to be the weaver holds  one end of a long tape, while the other is fastened to the left shoulder  of the first child. The weaver weaves the tape in and out among the  children, placing the second row lower down. It will be easily seen that  the children who had it passed in _front_ of them in the first row, had  it _behind_ them in the second, and vice versa.\"    The following weaving song in the Walker and Jenks book can be sung  during the weaving. To be sure it is not really \"over and under\" when  you think of them as _children_. Remember that they represent a mat,  and they are for the time the strips and border.        (_Sung to the tune of \"Nellie Bly._\")        Over one, under one,      Over one again.      Under one, over one,      Then we do the same.      Hi, weavers! Ho, weavers!      Come and weave with me!      You'll rarely find, go where you will,      A happier band than we!    Kate Douglas Wiggin (Mrs. Riggs) in her \"Republic of Childhood\"  describes the game in this way:    [Sidenote: _Explanation of the game_]    \"First choose a row of children for threads of the warp, standing at  such a distance from each other that a child may pass easily between  them. Second, choose a child, or children, for thread of woof. After  passing through the warp, each child takes his place at the end and  other children are chosen.\" In this way more children can take part than  if a tape were used. Some teachers play it in a different way, using the  desks with the seats turned up for the warp and the whole number of  children for the woof, winding in and out all over the room. This is  very delightful, indeed, if there is enough space for the children to  pass easily without tripping on the iron supports of the desks. This is  a good game for a rainy day, when there is no outdoor recess.    [Sidenote: _Bird games_]    The bird games are beautiful and leave a wholesome impression of home  life and home love on the children, which will have a lasting influence.  Few children, brought up in this tender and beautiful way, will ever  feel an inclination to harm the birds, or indeed any animal.    [Sidenote: _Interesting stories_]    The fund of stories of birds and birds' nests is almost inexhaustible.  Miss Poulsson's \"In the Child's World\" contains many stories of the  weaver (pages 407-412), and several about birds and birds' nests (pages  292-301). Her talks to teachers with regard to the presentation of each  subject are very helpful, as well as her suggestions for the teachers'  reading. Stories of the weaving birds, particularly the African weaver,  are interesting. It is said that two birds work together, one on the  inside of the nest and the other on the outside, passing the grass and  twigs in and out, until the home is completed. The children will enjoy,  too, stories of weaving in other lands, material for which can be easily  obtained. In fact, no one need to be without stories in these days of  books and magazines.    [Sidenote: _Conversation_]    [Sidenote: _Never repress the children_]    Last, but not least, is the conversation during the weaving. Anyone who  has attended a teachers' meeting, where the industrial work was being  given, has not failed to remark the sociability all over the room. \"How  are you getting on?\" \"Let me see yours.\" \"Oh, I cannot get it at all,\"  etc., etc., are heard everywhere, and yet those same teachers go into  their class rooms the next day and expect the children to work without  whispering. If they will read what Mrs. Wiggin says in the \"Republic of  Childhood,\" in her talk on \"Sewing,\" they will never be guilty of it  again. A good plan is to have the room perfectly quiet while a dictation  is being given, and then allow a period of relaxation when the little  folks can compare and admire the work to their hearts' content. Beware  of too much repression. A child when asked why a tree grew crooked,  replied: \"Somebody stepped on it, I suppose, when it was a little  fellow.\" The answer is painfully suggestive. Mrs. Wiggin truly says: \"If  the children are never to speak except when they answer questions, how  are we to know aught of their inner life?\"    The following list of songs, games, and stories suggests interesting  material to correlate with the work in hand-loom weaving.
