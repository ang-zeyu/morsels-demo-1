The    transition has proven difficult as successive governments have tried    to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated    infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks with links to high    government officials, and disruptive political opponents.    International observers judged parliamentary elections in 2001 and    local elections in 2003 to be acceptable and a step toward    democratic development, but identified serious deficiencies. Many of    these deficiencies have been addressed through bi-partisan changes    to the electoral code in 2003 and 2005, but implementation of these    changes will not be demonstrated until parliamentary elections in    July 2005.

At her words, the doctor tried to reassure her; but feeling  that if he opened his mouth he must needs break into sobs, he still kept  silent. The marquise appealed to him a third time. \"I entreat you, sir,  forgive me; and do not regret the time you have passed with me. You will  say a De Profundus at the moment of my death, and a mass far me  to-morrow: will you not promise?\"    \"Yes, madame,\" said the doctor in a choking voice; \"yes, yes, be calm,  and I will do all you bid me.\"    The executioner hereupon removed the board, and helped the marquise out  of the tumbril; and as they advanced the few steps towards the scaffold,  and all eyes were upon them, the doctor could hide his tears for a  moment without being observed. As he was drying his eyes, the assistant  gave him his hand to help him down. Meanwhile the marquise was mounting  the ladder with the executioner, and when they reached the platform he  told her to kneel down in front of a block which lay across it. Then the  doctor, who had mounted with a step less firm than hers, came and knelt  beside her, but turned in the other direction, so that he might whisper  in her ear--that is, the marquise faced the river, and the doctor faced  the Hotel de Ville. Scarcely had they taken their place thus when the  man took down her hair and began cutting it at the back and at the  sides, making her turn her head this way and that, at times rather  roughly; but though this ghastly toilet lasted almost half an hour, she  made no complaint, nor gave any sign of pain but her silent tears. When  her hair was cut, he tore open the top of the shirt, so as to uncover  the shoulders, and finally bandaged her eyes, and lifting her face by  the chin, ordered her to hold her head erect. She obeyed, unresisting,  all the time listening to the doctor's words and repeating them from  time to time, when they seemed suitable to her own condition. Meanwhile,  at the back of the scaffold, on which the stake was placed, stood the  executioner, glancing now and again at the folds of his cloak, where  there showed the hilt of a long, straight sabre, which he had carefully  concealed for fear Madame de Brinvilliers might see it when she mounted  the scaffold. When the doctor, having pronounced absolution, turned his  head and saw that the man was not yet armed, he uttered these prayers,  which she repeated after him: \"Jesus, Son of David and Mary, have mercy  upon me; Mary, daughter of David and Mother of Jesus, pray for me; my  God, I abandon my body, which is but dust, that men may burn it and do  with it what they please, in the firm faith that it shall one day arise  and be reunited with my soul. I trouble not concerning my body; grant, O  God, that I yield up to Thee my soul, that it may enter into Thy rest;  receive it into Thy bosom; that it may dwell once more there, whence it  first descended; from Thee it came, to Thee returns; Thou art the source  and the beginning; be thou, O God, the centre and the end!\"    The marquise had said these words when suddenly the doctor heard a dull  stroke like the sound of a chopper chopping meat upon a block: at that  moment she ceased to speak. The blade had sped so quickly that the  doctor had not even seen a flash. He stopped, his hair bristling, his  brow bathed in sweat; for, not seeing the head fall, he supposed that  the executioner had missed the mark and must needs start afresh. But his  fear was short-lived, for almost at the same moment the head inclined to  the left, slid on to the shoulder, and thence backward, while the body  fell forward on the crossway block, supported so that the spectators  could see the neck cut open and bleeding. Immediately, in fulfilment of  his promise, the doctor said a De Profundis.    When the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before  him the executioner wiping his face. \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"was not that  a good stroke? I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has  always assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this  lady. I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart.\"  He then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and  taking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in  his other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots,  which his assistant lighted.    \"The next day,\" says Madame de Sevigne, \"people were looking for the  charred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a  saint.\"    In 1814, M. d'Offemont, father of the present occupier of the castle  where the Marquise de Brinvilliers poisoned her father, frightened at  the approach of all the allied troops, contrived in one of the towers  several hiding-places, where he shut up his silver and such other  valuables as were to be found in this lonely country in the midst of the  forest of Laigue. The foreign troops were passing backwards and forwards  at Offemont, and after a three months' occupation retired to the farther  side of the frontier.    Then the owners ventured to take out the various things that had been  hidden; and tapping the walls, to make sure nothing had been overlooked,  they detected a hollow sound that indicated the presence of some  unsuspected cavity. With picks and bars they broke the wall open, and  when several stones had come out they found a large closet like a  laboratory, containing furnaces, chemical instruments, phials  hermetically sealed full of an unknown liquid, and four packets of  powders of different colours. Unluckily, the people who made these  discoveries thought them of too much or too little importance; and  instead of submitting the ingredients to the tests of modern science,  they made away with them all, frightened at their probably deadly  nature.    Thus was lost this great opportunity--probably the last--for finding and  analysing the substances which composed the poisons of Sainte-Croix and  Madame de Brinvilliers.                                            ----"]]]
