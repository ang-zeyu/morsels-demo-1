Why? Because  there are no fruits and berries in winter, and the roots of trees are  frozen hard and covered up by the snow.    Then if those bears cannot get anything to eat in winter, what do they  do? They _sleep_!    You know that when you are asleep you do not feel hungry; but as soon  as you wake up you feel hungry again. It is just the same with the  bear; he does not feel very hungry while he sleeps. And he _sleeps  right through the winter months_!    Still, while he is asleep all that time, does he not feel a little bit  hungry? He does. So he uses up the store of food inside his body! I  have told you that the camel carries a store of food in his hump. The  bear has no hump, of course, but he has a _thick chunk of fat all  around his body_ just under his skin; and that chunk of fat is his  _store of food_.    So, when the bear sleeps snugly in his den in the winter months, the  chunk of fat is slowly used up inside his body, and keeps him from  being very hungry.    Of course, he eats such a lot just before the winter, that the chunk  of fat is very thick when he goes to bed. But the chunk is all used up  when he wakes up at the end of the winter, and then he is very hungry  again!    But there is a kind of bear that lives in a place where there is snow  and ice almost all the time. What can _he_ do?    He cannot sleep always! So he has to get something to eat now and  then, and I shall tell you how he does that.      _The Polar Bear_    This kind of bear is called the _polar bear_. (See the picture on page  155.) He lives in a place far up North, where it is always very cold.  The land is nearly covered with snow, and the water at the top of the  sea is frozen. There are no berries or fruits there for the polar bear  to eat; so he has to live on fish, and seal, which is a water animal.  The way the bear catches the fish or the seal is this:    He makes a hole in the ice with his paws, so that he can reach the  water below. Then he sits down very quietly by the edge of the hole,  and waits for a fish or a seal to swim past the hole. Then the bear  pounces on it very quickly with his paw or his jaws, and catches it.    If the ice is too thick for the bear to make a hole through it, he has  to try another way. He comes right down to the part of the sea where  some of the ice has broken off. There he chooses a place at the edge  of the ice, close to the water; and he waits there for a fish or a  seal to swim past. Then he pounces on it and catches it.    Now I shall tell you a few special things that the polar bear has.    His coat of hair is much _thicker_ than the coat of any other bear.  Why? Because he lives in a colder place than any other bear; so he  _needs_ a thicker coat. Also, he sometimes has to swim through the icy  water to get to some floating field of ice, so that he can catch fish  from it. Then, although his hair gets wet, he has a thick lining of  fat inside his coat to keep him warm.    The next special thing about the polar bear is that his hair is _all  white_--like the color of everything around him, which, as I have  told you, is just snow and ice. So when the polar bear sits down very  quietly on the snow and ice, nobody can see him even from a short  distance, because he is the same color as the snow and ice. And that  is why the fish or the seal does not see him, and so gets caught.    [Illustration: Polar Bear]    That is one of the wonderful things about many wild animals--they are  of the _same color as the place where they live_. You know that the  color of a lion is yellow, like the color of sand; and the lion lives  in countries where there are lots of sandy places. You know, too, that  the color of a tiger is yellow, but with black stripes upon the  yellow, so that if you looked at him from a distance, you might think  he was made up of yellow and black stripes. And the tiger lives in the  tall grass, which also looks like yellow and black stripes.    But now I shall tell you more about the polar bear. He has three other  special things: the _soles_ of his feet are _hairy_; he has a _small  head_; and he has a _long neck_.    First, about the soles of his feet. The soles of the feet of other  bears are smooth, just like the feet of all other animals that have to  walk on ordinary ground. But the soles of the polar bear are covered  with long hair, just as is his body. Why? Because he has to walk on  ice, which is very slippery, and he needs to have the soles of his  feet covered with hair, or else he would slip on the ice, just as you  must wear rubbers over your shoes when you have to walk on icy ground.    Now, my dear, just stop for a minute, and think. Among all the  wonderful things that I have told you so far, you have always noticed  that an animal always has _just the very thing he needs! We_ have to  _make_ rubbers, and warm coats, and gloves, and socks, and a dozen  things that we need. But to every animal God has given everything  that he needs, right on his body.    But now let us go on with the polar bear. He has a smaller head than  any other kind of bear. Why? To make it easier for him to put his head  through the hole in the ice, when he is catching fish. Other kinds of  bears do not have to put their heads into a hole to get anything to  eat; so they do not need to have a small head.    The polar bear has also a longer neck than any other kind of bear.  Why? To give him a longer reach in catching the fish with his  jaws--without tumbling into the water himself. Other bears, who live  on dry land, do not need to reach out like that, and so they have  shorter necks.    I shall now tell you about these other kinds of bears.      _American Bears_    First you shall hear about the bears that live in America. The biggest  kind is called the _grizzly bear_. In fact, he is the largest bear in  the world. Some grizzly bears are ten feet tall when they stand up on  their hind legs!    The color of a grizzly bear is yellow, but with many shades;  sometimes between brown and yellow, and sometimes between red and  yellow. Teddy bears, with which you have played, are sometimes made of  that color. Teddy bears of course are very nice, as they are toys; but  I am sorry to say that the real grizzly bear is not nice; he is very  fierce. In fact, he is the only kind of bear that is so fierce. Even  grown-up men do not want to go near him.    The grizzly is found in many parts of North America, near the Rocky  Mountains, from the United States right up to Alaska. He lives on  berries and all kinds of fruits, and also on the soft roots of trees.  But the grizzly bear eats meat also, if he can manage to catch deer or  cattle. That is why cowboys in Colorado and Wyoming do not like the  grizzly bear--he tries to kill and eat their cows.    Besides, he kills a lot of fish. In the Columbia River in Oregon there  are lots of trout and shad, which people like to have for their  dinner. But the grizzly bear gets to the river first, and eats a great  many of the trout and the shad. How does he catch the fish? Why, he  just lies down along the bank, and waits for the fish to rise to the  top of the water. The trout and the shad like to rise to the top of  the water now and again, and swim there. So the grizzly just waits  for a fish to rise--and then he pounces on it and catches it with his  paw. He is so very quick that he hardly ever misses. All kinds of  bears are very clever in catching fish.      _Other Bears_    Another kind of bear is called the _brown bear_. He lives in Europe,  Asia, and also in some parts of America, especially in Alaska. There  he is rather big, though not quite so big as the grizzly bear. He too  lives on berries, fruits, and roots, and he also catches fish. For in  the rivers of Alaska there are lots of salmon.    But the brown bear is not at all fierce, like the grizzly bear. He is  peace-loving, and sometimes quite friendly.    The nicest kind of bear is called the _black bear_. He is found in all  parts of the United States, and in many other countries. He is  sometimes rather small, and is quite full of fun. Almost all the good  stories you may hear about bears are about the black bear.    Many people mistake the black bear for the brown bear; so when you  sometimes hear people talking about a \"brown\" bear, you may know that  they really mean a \"black\" bear.    Like other bears, the black bear lives on berries, fruits, and roots,  and also on nuts, if he can find any. But what he likes best is honey!  It is quite amusing to see the bear hold a honeycomb in one paw, scoop  out the honey with the other, and put it into his mouth. It looks just  like a boy holding a pot of jam in one hand, and sticking his fingers  into the jam and putting it on his tongue!    \"But do not the bees get angry, and try to sting him?\" you may ask.    Of course they do. The bees swarm around the bear and try to sting him  all over. But they cannot! He is _too hairy_! They cannot get through  the hair to sting him on the skin. So he goes on licking the honey and  smacking his lips!    The black bear is always a funny animal. Perhaps you have seen him in  the zoo. He will squat on the ground like a man, and if he sees a  crowd of people before him, he will swing his arms just as a man does  when he talks to a friend. Perhaps the bear has seen some men do that,  and has learned to do the same!    And sometimes he will sit on the ground, hold his tail in his mouth,  and fumble head over heels, or roll over and over, or spin round and  round--just for fun! In fact, the black bear is among the _few  grown-up animals that love to play_. Many _young_ animals of course,  such as kittens, puppy dogs, calves, and many others, love to play.  But most grown-up animals do not seem to care for play, except the  black bear.    When he is caught and tamed, he is still very playful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#16)"],[1,"  ~UNLOADING WITH GRAB BUCKETS.~--The orange-peel or clam-shell bucket is an  excellent device for unloading sand or stone from cars or barges. The  cost of unloading, including cleaning up the portions not reached by the  bucket, is not more than from 2 to 5 cts. per cu. yd. A grab bucket of  either of these types can be applied to any derrick. In unloading broken  stone from barges at Ossining, N. Y., a Hayward clam-shell on a  stiff-leg derrick unloaded 100 cu. yds. of broken stone per day from  barge into wagons, with one engineman and one helper. In addition to the  bucket work there was 24 hours' labor cleaning on each 500-cu. yd. barge  load. The labor cost of unloading a 500-cu. yd. barge was as follows:                                         Per Cu. Yd.  One engineman, at $2.50                 2.5 cts.  One helper, at $1.50                    1.5 cts.  Labor cleaning, at $1.50                0.7 cts.                                          --------  Total cost per cubic yard               4.7 cts.    ~INCLINES.~--Inclines to reach the tops of mixer and storage bins and the  level of concrete work can be operated on about the following grades:  For teams hauling wagons or cars, 2 per cent. maximum grade. A single  heavy team will haul a 5-cu. yd. car, with ordinary bearings, weighing  2½ tons empty and 12 tons loaded, with ease on a 1½ per cent. grade,  and with some difficulty on a 2 per cent. grade. A locomotive will  handle cars on a grade of from 4 to 5 per cent. For team haulage 20-lb.  rails may be used, and for locomotives 30-lb. rails. Grades steeper than  about 5 per cent. require cable haulage.    ~TRESTLE AND CAR PLANTS.~--Trestle and car plants for handling both  concrete materials and mixed concrete have a wide range of application  and numerous examples of such plants are described in succeeding  chapters, and are noted in the index at the end of the book. The  following estimates of the cost of a trestle and car plant are given by  Mr. Wm. G. Fargo. The work is assumed to cover an area of 100×200 ft.  and to have three-fourths of its bulk below the economical elevation of  the mixer, which stands within 50 ft. of the near side of the work. If  the work is under 3,000 cu. yds. in bulk and there is a reasonable time  limit for completion one mixer of 200 cu. yds. capacity per 10-hour day  is assumed to be sufficient. The items of car plant cost will be about  as follows:    150 ft. trestle, at $1.50                               $225  5 split switches with spring bridles, at $18              90  2 iron turntables, at $30                                 60  3-2/3 cu. yd. steel cars with roller bearings            190                                                        ------  Total                                                   $565    The trestle assumed is double 24-in. gage track, 6 ft. on centers;  stringers 6×8 ins.×22 to 24 ft.; ties 2×6 ins., 2½ ft. on centers;  running boards 2×12 ins. for each track, and 12-lb. rails; trestle legs,  average length 30 ft., of green poles at 5 cts. per foot. This outfit  with repairs and renewals amounting to 10 per cent., is considered good  for five season's work and the timber work for several jobs if not too  far apart. The yearly rental on the basis of five seasons' work would be  $124.30, or $1 per working day for a season of five months. Three cars  delivering ½ cu. yd. batches can deliver 200 cu. yds. of concrete, an  average of 100 ft. from the mixer in 10 hours. Five men, including a man  tending switches and turntable and one man to help dump, can operate the  plant. With wages at $1.75 per day the labor cost of handling 200 cu.  yds. of concrete would be 4-1/8 cts. per cu. yd.    ~CABLEWAYS.~--Cableways arranged to span the work and if the area is wide  to travel across the work at right angles to the span will handle  concrete, concrete materials, forms, steel and supplies with great  economy. They are particularly suitable for bridge and dam work, filter  and reservoir work, building foundations and low buildings. The  arrangement of a cableway plant for bridge work is described in Chapter  XVII. A cableway of 800 ft. clear span on fixed towers 45 ft. high will  cost complete from $4,500 to $5,000, and will handle 200 cu. yds. of  concrete per 10-hour day. To put the cableway on traveling towers will  cost about $1,000 more. In constructing the Pittsburg filtration work  four traveling cableways from 250 to 600 ft. span were used. The towers  were from 50 to 60 ft. in height and each traveled on a 5-rail track.  The cableways were self-propelling. With conditions favorable each  cableway delivered 300 cu. yds. of concrete per day. A cableway plant  for heavy fortification work is described in Chapter XI.    ~BELT CONVEYORS.~--Belt conveyors may be used successfully for handling  both concrete materials and mixed concrete. For handling wet concrete  the slope must be quite flat, and the belt must be provided with some  means of cleaning off the sticky mortar paste. In several cases rotating  brushes stationed at the end of the belt, where it turns over the tail  pulley, have worked successfully; these brushes sweep the belt clean.  Except for the cleaning device the ordinary arrangement of belt conveyor  for dry materials serves for concrete.    In constructing a large gas works at Astoria, Long Island, near New York  city, belt conveyors were used to handle both the sand, gravel and  cement bags and the mixed concrete. The belt for handling sand and  gravel is shown by Fig. 13. A derrick operating a clam-shell unloaded  the sand and gravel into a small hopper, discharging into dump cars  operated by a \"dinky\" up an incline, passing over sand and gravel  storage bins. A 20-in. belt conveyor ran horizontally 105 ft. under the  bins, then up an incline of 3.4 ft. in 125 ft. to feeding hoppers over  the mixers. This conveyor received alternately sand and gravel by chute  from the storage bins and bags of cement loaded by hand, and carried  them to the feeding bins and mixer platform. The speed of the belt was  350 ft. per minute, and it required 6 h.p. to operate it when carrying  100 tons per hour. The mixing was done in two Smith mixers, which turned  out 70 cu. yds. or 35 cu. yds. each per hour. The mixed concrete was  delivered onto a 50-ft. 24-in. belt conveyor traveling at a speed of 400  ft. per minute and dumping through a chute into cars. Only 1 h.p. was  required to run the concrete conveyor. A rotating brush was used to keep  the belt clean at the dumping end. It will be noted that only a small  amount of power is required for operation.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Belt Conveyor Transporting Sand and Gravel.]    ~CHUTES.~--Chutes of wood or iron are among the simplest and most  efficient means of moving the cement, sand and stone and the mixed  concrete when the ground levels permit such devices.    Bags of cement if given a start in casting will slide down a steel or  very smooth wooden chute with a slope of 1 ft. in 5 or 6 ft. A wooden  trough 12 ins. deep and 24 ins. wide with boards dressed on the inside  may be used. When the inclination is steep and the fall is great, some  device is necessary to diminish the velocity of descent; the following  is an example of such a device which was successfully employed in a  chute of the above dimensions, 400 ft. long and having a drop of 110 ft.  This chute had a maximum inclination of 45° and its lower end curved to  a horizontal tangent, running into the storehouse. Near the bottom of  the chute a horizontal strip was nailed across the upper edges and to it  was nailed the upper end of a 20 ft., 1×12-in. board, the lower end of  which rested on the bottom of the chute. Several pieces of timber spiked  to the upper side loaded the lower end of this board. The cement bag in  descending wedged itself into the angle between the chute and the board  and lifted the latter, the spring of the board and the weight at the  lower end offering enough resistance to cut down the velocity. After the  chute had been in use for some time and had worn smooth it was found  necessary to add two more brakes to check the bags.    Broken stone will slide down a steel or steel lined chute with a slope  of 1 in 3 or 4 ft. if given a start in casting. Damp sand will not slide  down a chute with a slope of 1½ in 1.    A wet cement grout will flow down a smooth plank chute, with a slope of  1 in 4 ft., and wet concrete will move on the same slope; comparatively  dry concrete requires a slope of nearly 1 in 1, or 45°, to secure free  movement. Mr. W. J. Douglas gives the following examples of conveying  concrete by chute, prefaced by the statement that his experience  indicates that concrete can thus be conveyed considerable distances  without material injury if proper precautions are taken.    In the first case a semi-circular steel trough about 2 ft. wide and 1  ft. deep and 15 ft. long set on a slope of 45° was used. A lift gate of  sheet steel was set in the chute about 2 ft. from the upper end. The  concrete was allowed to accumulate behind this gate until a wheelbarrow  load was had, when the batch was let loose by lifting the gate and was  discharged into barrows at the bottom. In another case a vertical chute  15 ft. long, consisting of a 15-in. square box with a canvas end, was  used. The concrete was dumped into the chute in batches of about 8 cu.  ft.; two men at the bottom \"cut down\" the pile with hoes to keep it from  coning and causing separation of the stone. In a third case a continuous  mixer fed into a sheet iron lined rectangular chute about 2½ ft. wide  and 1 ft. deep, with a vertical drop of 60 ft. on a slope of 1 in 1, or  45°. A gate was fixed in the chute 2 ft. from the top and at the bottom  the chute fed into a pyramidal hopper 3 ft. square at the top, 1 ft.  square at the bottom and 4½ ft. deep. This hopper was provided with a  bottom gate and was set on legs so that its top"]]]
