On one  of these occasions, a little lady friend christened an aldermanic German  by a patriotic name which since has taken the place of his own. \"He was  a man of an unbounded stomach,\" seemingly, with the French maxim ever  uppermost in his mind: _Quand la cornemuse est pleine on en chant mieux_  (when the belly is full, the music goes better). An escopette ball at  Molino-del-Rey struck him on the head, and the ponderous mass rolling  over and over on the ground, he was left for dead, but his time had not  yet come. It was a heavy blow, and though alive, yet his reason, at  times, is gone: predicting something novel in the history of man to  happen on the 4th of April next. Another joyful day is the visit of the  paymaster, which happens six times a year. His last supply is  gone--hence his anxiety to replenish. He is very happy to see this  financial individual--as much so as any body was with the arrival of the  first California steamer with two millions in gold. His only drawback  is, that his mortal enemy, the sutler, is then invariably ready to face  him with a small bill for sundry articles, such as cheese, whiting, and  \"some drinks.\" He had no idea it was so large! Generally he pays to a  fraction; sometimes, like broken banks, he compromises for a certain per  centum; sometimes he repudiates _in toto_. He is often economical,  spending nothing, and transmitting his savings to destitute relations at  home or abroad. A thousand hearts were gladdened, and a thousand mouths  fed, in the poor Emerald Isle during her starving days, by five pound  drafts from \"the bold soldier-boy\" over the water. These substantial  tokens from the home of his adoption have a secret but visible effect.  The military roads he lays out are found and followed by the recipients  of his bounty, and gardens flourish where but yesterday were seen the  poles of his old camping ground; new states rise out the wilderness,  where he planted the early seed, and watched the glittering things as  they grew to the strength and beauty of their starry sisters.    He has no enmity or prejudice against any person, sect, or  society--loving Broadbrim even more than could reasonably be expected.  There is, however, a proverbial enmity between him and Jack the sailor,  though it is generally of that Pickwickian nature, that--like Micawber's  griefs--easily dissolves over a bowl of punch, and both become as jolly  as Friar Tuck and Richard. He is not generally religious; but during  divine service is as orderly as a deacon. Sometimes he pleads conscience  against Protestant worship, but those interested may be assured that, in  five cases out of six, it is only Pat's cunning: true piety can worship  God under any form. He is generally a bachelor, and rarely goes beyond  the walls for a wife: if Abigail comes inside, he snaps her up as you  would a hotcake on a frosty morning. If he dies prematurely, some  comrade is ready to console the widow in her affliction; the courtship  being a fine exemplification of--        \"For you must know a widow's won      With brisk attempt and putting on:      With ent'ring manfully and urging--      Not slow approaches like a virgin.\"    Should she fail, however, she trips off to another post, where, \"her  case being duly represented at the mess,\" she generally manages to get  reinstated in the army. It is for the good of the service that marriage  is in some degree restricted, and the reasons therefor, none will fail  to perceive.    The soldier's history and accounts are posted up regularly every two  months at Washington--that great ledger of the United States--so that if  he has been sentenced to a money stoppage, or broken a tumbler-screw, it  is there accurately recorded. He is kept well supplied, where it is  practicable, with the news of the day, contained in two dailies, one of  which, generally, is from New-York, and the other from Washington. At  nearly all the principal posts neat little chapels have been built, and  chaplains provided, so that he can worship God, if he desires, morning  and evening, and without expense.    The discipline governing him is severe; so much so that it is sometimes  made ground of complaint. This severity is necessary for the creation  and preservation of prompt obedience and clock-like regularity. Severe  laws are necessary in every body--civil, religious, and military--and in  no one, it is fair to say, are they more strictly enforced than in the  army of the United States. The sad penalty of death is rarely, if ever,  decreed, except in a regularly constituted war. A fearful instance of it  occurred in the valley of Mexico during our late contest with that  crumbling republic. Fifty deserters were condemned, but their execution  temporarily delayed by the officer in charge, that they might see the  stars and stripes run up over the falling castle of Chapultepec, and  their last gaze on earth be fixed, as well on the faithful valor of  their comrades, as on the flag they had shamelessly forsaken. As their  bodies swung to and fro, well relieved against the sky, and the setting  sun cast its lurid beams over countenances yet warm in death, many felt  the extreme severity yet justice of military law, particularly in an  enemy's country. In time of peace the punishment varies from a  dishonorable discharge to little temporary deprivations and  confinements, except for insubordination and desertion, when the law  again permits of considerable severity. The stories about long  confinements in dreary holes, starvation, &c., which we sometimes see in  the \"newspapers of little circulation,\" are about as true as the nursery  tales in children's primers. Of the minor punishments, those which  combine an appeal to his pride are the most dreaded, and often have a  salutary effect. A mounted trooper would rather perform picket duty all  night, in any weather, than once take a stationary gallop on the wooden  \"bob-tailed nag,\" facing the other way. The soldier's crimes--nearly  all--are criminal only in that they offend against military laws; and if  once in a while he has a hearing before Justice M., \"you should not,\" as  he contends, \"expect all the cardinal virtues for seven dollars a  month.\"    Wherever the pioneer has laid his axe, there you will find the soldier,  a ready watch-dog between the settler and the savage; and it is a great  misnomer for any one \"in Congress assembled,\" to call him one of a  \"peace establishment,\" as three-fifths of his number are now on active  service. In Florida--encamped in hammocks, or on the banks of some  unhealthy stream--he is parleying with the Seminole; while in New  Mexico, and over the vast frontier of Texas, he is engaged in deadly war  with other tribes: the war seeming to be without a beginning, as well as  without an end. In the back grounds of California, he escorts the  treaty-making powers, while with his axe he lays out military roads, and  measures them as he goes along. After a long march over the Rocky  Mountains, or a sea-voyage of twenty thousand miles round the \"stormy  cape\"--we find him, again, constructing block-houses along the Columbia  river in Oregon; as much to protect him against the winter's cold, as to  serve as means of future defence. The United States constitute a large  patch of ground on the map of nations, with much work to do on her  extensive frontier; and he is the pack-horse that tugs faithfully at the  burden. Far away from the many comforts and conveniences that surround  you--in prairie or wilderness--often without clothes, oftener without  food--in sunshine and storm--winter and summer--in the midst of sickness  and death--relentless foes on the hill-tops and in the valleys--he toils  on, with no help from Congress to do what ought to be, but what cannot  be done: certainly, cannot be done! for there are well known \"treaty  stipulations,\" and the lawmakers expect him, generally on foot, to  pursue, overtake, and severely punish the well-mounted savage. Fatal  error! every southerly wind brings with it a wail of the dying border  man, and Mexico will yet, ere the present \"long parliament\" closes,  present her wrongs before the proper source, the master--not the man.  But we have digressed once or twice into extraneous topics: they  germinated from the subject, and as they can do no harm, let them stand  as written.    Do not suppose, then, because the Greenwich recruit is well-clothed, and  somewhat proud withal, that his life is one of comparative ease. In  virtue of all he does for you and your children's children, while plenty  is on your right and on your left hand, rank him far above the hireling  in its corrupted sense. He does much for the mite given him in return,  and never murmurs at the task. At early dawn he rises, slings his  knapsack, fills his canteen from the brook, and, with a scant ration in  his haversack, marches a long Texan summer's day, recounting to his  comrade some adventure in the old country, or the last news from the  white settlements. At night, he spreads his blanket on the ground, his  knapsack serves as pillow, and with no covering but the stars, he awaits  the coming day to renew the fruitless scout. Perhaps, as he faces the  sky, he pictures in the clouds heavily rolling o'er the moon, a mimic  battle, in which his company is in the thickest of the fight; perhaps he  is dreaming of--what? It is hard to tell: it may be of Betty in return;  it may be of a wee sister or dear old mother far away over the  seas--whom, since many years he has not seen, and then, God help his sad  and weary heart! the prospect is a dreary one indeed of ever beholding  \"sacred home\" again. He has fought well for you in the days of the  Knickerbockers and in the valley of Mexico, and the same brave spirit  adorns the homely bosom still.
