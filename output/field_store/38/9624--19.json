[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#16)"],[1," such a sympathy  between the stomach and the rest of the system, that the first is  very seldom disordered, without communicating more or less disorder  to the system: nor can the system become deranged and the stomach  remain sound.    A want of appetite may arise from overloading the stomach, whereby  its digestive powers will be weakened. And this may be occasioned in  two ways. First, by taking food of the common quality in too great  quantity, which will certainly weaken the powers of the stomach. An  excellent rule, and one which if more attended to, would prevent the  dreadful consequences of indigestion, is always to rise from the  table with some remains of appetite. This is a rule applicable to  every constitution, but particularly to the sedentary and  debilitated.    The second way in which the stomach may be debilitated, is by taking  food too highly stimulating or seasoned; and this even produces much  worse effects than an over dose with respect to quantity. The tone of  the stomach is destroyed, and a crude unassimilated chyle is absorbed  by the lacteals, and carried into the blood, contaminating its whole  mass. Made dishes, enriched with hot sauces, stimulate infinitely  more than plain food, and bring on diseases of the worst kind: such  as gout, apoplexy, and paralysis. \"For my part,\" says an elegant  writer, \"when I behold a fashionable table set out in all its  magnificence, I fancy I see gouts, and dropsies, fevers, and  lethargies, with other innumerable distempers, lying in ambuscade  among the dishes.\"    All times of the day are not equally fitted for the reception of  nourishment. That digestion may be well performed, the functions of  the stomach and of the body must be in full vigour. The early part of  the day therefore is the proper time for taking nutriment; and, in my  opinion, the principal meal should not be taken after two or three  o'clock, and there should always be a sufficient time between each  meal to enable the stomach to digest its contents. I need not remark  how very different this is from the common practice of jumbling two  or three meals together, and at a time of the day likewise when the  system is overloaded. The breakfast at sunrise, the noontide repast  and the twilight pillow, which distinguished the days of Elizabeth,  are now changed for the evening breakfast, and the midnight dinner.  The evening is by no means the proper time to take much nourishment:  for the powers of the system, and particularly of the stomach, are  then almost exhausted, and the food will be but half digested.  Besides, the addition of fresh chyle to the blood, together with the  stimulus of food acting on the stomach, always prevents sleep, or  renders it confused and disturbed, and instead of having our worn out  spirits recruited, by what is emphatically called by Shakespeare,  \"the chief nourisher in life's feast,\" and rising in the morning  fresh and vigorous, we become heavy and stupid, and feel the whole  system relaxed.    It is by no means uncommon, for a physician to have patients, chiefly  among people of fashion and fortune, who complain of being hot and  restless all night, and having a bad taste in the mouth in the  morning. On examination, I have found that, at least in nineteen  cases out of twenty, this has arisen from their having overloaded  their stomachs, and particularly from eating hot suppers; nor do I  recollect a single instance of a complaint of this kind in any person  not in the habit of eating such suppers.    The immoderate use of spirituous and fermented liquors, is still more  destructive of the digestive powers of the stomach; but this will be  better understood, when we have examined the laws by which external  powers act upon the body. The remarks I have made could not, however,  I think, have come in better, than immediately after our examination  of the structure of the digestive organs, as the impropriety of  intemperance, with respect to food, is thus rendered more evident.    The appetite becomes deficient from want of exercise, independently  of the other causes that have been mentioned. Of all the various  modes of preserving health, and preventing diseases, there is none  more efficacious than exercise; it quickens the motion of the fluids,  strengthens the solids, causes a more perfect sanguification in the  lungs, and, in short, gives strength and vigour to every function of  the body. Hence it is, that the Author of nature has made exercise  absolutely necessary to the greater part of mankind for obtaining  means of existence. Had not exercise been absolutely necessary for  our well being, says the elegant Addison, nature would not have made  the body so proper for it, by giving such an activity to the limbs,  and such a pliancy to every part, as necessarily produce those  compressions, extensions, contortions, dilatations, and all other  kinds of motion, as are necessary for the preservation of such a  system of tubes and glands.    We may, indeed, observe, that nature has never given limbs to any  animal, without intending that they should be used. To fish she has  given fins, and to the fowls of the air wings, which are incessantly  used in swimming and flying; and if she had destined mankind to be  eternally dragged about by horses, her provident economy would surely  have denied them legs.    The appetite becomes deficient on the commencement of many diseases,  but this is to be looked upon here rather as a salutary than as a  morbid symptom, and as a proof that nature refuses the load, which  she can neither digest nor bear with impunity.    In healthy people the appetite is various, some requiring more food  than others; but it sometimes becomes praeternaturally great, and  then may be regarded as a morbid symptom. The appetite may be  praeternaturally increased, either by an unusual secretion of the  gastric juice, which acts upon the coats of the stomach, or by any  acrimony, either generated in, or received into the stomach, or,  lastly, by habit, for people undoubtedly may gradually accustom  themselves to take more food than is necessary.    The appetite sometimes becomes depraved, and a person thus affected,  feels a desire to eat substances that are by no means nutritious, or  even esculent: this often depends on a debilitated state of the whole  system. There are some instances, however, in which this depravity of  the appetite is salutary; for example, the great desire which some  persons, whose stomachs abound with acid, have for eating chalk, and  other absorbent earths: likewise, the desire which scorbutic patients  have for grass, and other fresh vegetables. Appetites of this kind,  if moderately indulged in, are salutary, rather than hurtful.    The appetite for liquids as well as solids is sometimes observed to  be deficient, and sometimes too great. The former can scarcely be  considered as a morbid symptom, provided the digestion and health be  otherwise good. But when along with diminished thirst, the fauces and  tongue are dry, this deficiency may be regarded as a morbid and  dangerous symptom.    A more common morbid symptom, however, is too great thirst, which may  arise from a deficiency of fluids in the body, produced by violent  exercise, perspiration, too great a flow of urine, or too great an  evacuation of the intestines. A praeternatural thirst may likewise  arise from any acrid substance received into the stomach, which our  provident mother, nature, teaches us to correct by dilution; this is  the case with respect to salted meats, or those highly seasoned with  pepper. It may arise also from the stomach being overloaded with  unconcocted aliment, or from a suppressed or diminished secretion of  the salivary liquors in the mouth, which may arise from fever, spasm,  or affections of the mind; an increased thirst may likewise take  place, from a derivation or determination of the fluids to other  parts of the body; of this, dropsy affords an example. Indeed,  various causes may concur to increase the thirst; this is the case in  most fevers, where great thirst is occasioned by the dissipation of  the fluids of the body by heat, as well as by the diminished  secretion of the salivary humours which should moisten the mouth; to  which may be added, the heat and diminished concoctive powers of the  stomach.    From what has been said, we can easily understand, why praeternatural  thirst may sometimes be a necessary instinct of nature, at other  times, an unnecessary craving; why acids, acescent fruits, and weak  fermented liquors quench thirst more powerfully than pure water; and  lastly, why thirst, in some instances, may be relieved by emetics,  when it has resisted other remedies.    There is no organ of the body whose functions are so easily deranged  as those of the stomach; and these derangements prove a very fertile  source of disease; they ought, therefore, carefully to be guarded  against; and it is fortunate for us that we have this generally in  our power, if we would but avail ourselves of it: for most of the  derangements proceed from the improper use of food and drink, and a  neglect of exercise. Indeed, when we examine, we shall find but a  short list in the long catalogue of human diseases, which it is not  in our power to guard against and prevent: and which surely will be  guarded against, when their causes are known, and consequences  understood.    Among the diseases arising from a disordered state of the stomach and  indigestion, may be enumerated the following: great oppression and  anxiety, pain in the region of the stomach, with acid eructations,  nausea, vomiting, the bowels sometimes costive, sometimes too loose,  but seldom regular, depression of spirits, and all the long list,  commonly, but very improperly, termed nervous complaints, deficient  nutrition, and consequently general weakness, a relaxed state of the  solids, too great a tenuity of the fluids, headach, vertigo, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#16)"],[1,"cattle show the presence of the disease as indicated  by the tuberculin test, a condition that does not obtain in any large  section in this country.    The observations on the presence of the tubercle bacillus in butter have  been questioned somewhat of late[2] by the determination of the fact  that butter may contain an organism that possesses the property of being  stained in the same way as the tubercle organism. Differentiation  between the two forms is rendered more difficult by the fact that this  tubercle-like organism is also capable of producing in animals lesions  that stimulate those of tuberculosis, although a careful examination  reveals definite differences. Petri[90] has recently determined that  both the true tubercle and the acid-resisting butter organism may be  readily found in market butter.    In the various milk products it has been experimentally determined that  the true tubercle bacillus is able to retain its vitality in butter for  a number of months and in cheese for nearly a year.    ~Treatment of milk from tuberculosis cows.~ While it has been shown that  it is practically impossible to foretell whether the milk of any  reacting animal actually contains tubercle bacilli or not, still the  interests of public health demand that no milk from such stock be used  for human food until it has been rendered safe by some satisfactory  treatment.    _1. Heating._ By far the best treatment that can be given such milk is  to heat it. The temperature at which this should be done depends upon  the thermal death point of the tubercle bacillus, a question concerning  which there has been considerable difference of opinion until very  recently. According to the work of some of the earlier investigators,  the tubercle bacillus in its vegetative stage is endowed with powers of  resistance greater than those possessed by any other pathogenic  organism. This work has not been substantiated by the most recent  investigations on this subject. In determining the thermal death point  of this organism, as of any other, not only must the temperature be  considered, but the period of exposure as well, and where that exposure  is made in milk, another factor must be considered, viz., the presence  of conditions permitting of the formation of a \"scalded layer,\" for as  Smith[91] first pointed out, the resistance of the tubercle organism  toward heat is greatly increased under these conditions. If tuberculous  milk is heated in a closed receptacle where this scalded membrane cannot  be produced, the tubercle bacillus is killed at 140 deg. F. in 15 to 20  minutes. These results which were first determined by Smith, under  laboratory conditions, and confirmed by Russell and Hastings,[92] where  tuberculous milk was heated in commercial pasteurizers, have also been  verified by Hesse.[93] A great practical advantage which accrues from  the treatment of milk at 140 deg. F. is that the natural creaming is  practically unaffected. Of course, where a higher temperature is  employed, the period of exposure may be materially lessened. If milk is  momentarily heated to 176 deg. F., it is certainly sufficient to destroy  the tubercle bacillus. This is the plan practiced in Denmark where all  skim milk and whey must be heated to this temperature before it can be  taken back to the farm, a plan which is designed to prevent the  dissemination of tuberculosis and foot and mouth disease by means of the  mixed creamery by-products. This course renders it possible to utilize  with perfect safety, for milk supplies, the milk of herds reacting to the  tuberculin test, and as butter of the best quality can be made from  cream or milk heated to even high temperatures,[94] it thus becomes  possible to prevent with slight expense what would otherwise entail a  large loss.    _2. Dilution._ Another method that has been suggested for the treatment  of this suspected milk is dilution with a relatively large volume of  perfectly healthy milk. It is a well known fact that to produce  infection, it requires the simultaneous introduction of a number of  organisms, and in the case of tuberculosis, especially that produced by  ingestion, this number is thought to be considerable. Gebhardt[95] found  that the milk of tuberculous cows, which was virulent when injected by  itself into animals, was innocuous when diluted with 40 to 100 times its  volume of healthy milk. This fact is hardly to be relied upon in  practice, unless the proportion of reacting to healthy cows is  positively known.    It has also been claimed in the centrifugal separation of cream from  milk[96] that by far the larger number of tubercle bacilli were thrown  out with the separator slime. Moore[97] has shown that the tubercle  bacilli in an artificially infected milk might be reduced in this way,  so as to be no longer microscopically demonstrable, yet the purification  was not complete enough to prevent the infection of animals inoculated  with the milk.    Another way to exclude all possibility of tubercular infection in milk  supplies is to reject all milk from reacting animals. This method is  often followed where pasteurization or sterilization is not desired. In  dairies where the keeping quality is dependent upon the exclusion of  bacteria by stringent conditions as to milking and handling (\"sanitary\"  or \"hygienic\" milk), the tuberculin test is frequently used as a basis  to insure healthy milk.    ~Foot and mouth disease.~ The wide-spread extension of this disease  throughout Europe in recent years has given abundant opportunity to show  that while it is distinctively an animal malady, it is also  transmissible to man, although the disease is rarely fatal. The causal  organism has not been determined with certainty, but it has been shown  that the milk of affected animals possesses infectious properties[98]  although appearing unchanged in earlier phases of the disease.    Hertwig showed the direct transmissibility of the disease to man by  experiments made on himself and others. By ingesting milk from an  affected animal, he was able to produce the symptoms of the disease, the  mucous membrane of the mouth being covered with the small vesicles that  characterize the malady. It has also been shown that the virus of the  disease may be conveyed in butter.[99] This disease is practically  unknown in this country, although widely spread in Europe.    There are a number of other bovine diseases such as anthrax,[100]  lockjaw,[101] and hydrophobia[102] in which it has been shown that the  virus of the disease is at times to be found in the milk supply, but  often the milk becomes visibly affected, so that the danger of using the  same is greatly minimized.    There are also a number of inflammatory udder troubles known as garget  or mammitis. In most of these, the physical appearance of the milk is so  changed, and often pus is present to such a degree as to give a very  disagreeable appearance to the milk. Pus-forming bacteria (staphylococci  and streptococci) are to be found associated with such troubles. A  number of cases of gastric and intestinal catarrh have been reported as  caused by such milks.[103]      DISEASES TRANSMISSIBLE TO MAN THROUGH INFECTION OF MILK AFTER  WITHDRAWAL.    Milk is so well adapted to the development of bacteria in general, that  it is not surprising to find it a suitable medium for the growth of many  pathogenic species even at ordinary temperatures. Not infrequently,  disease-producing bacteria are able to grow in raw milk in competition  with the normal milk bacteria, so that even a slight contamination may  suffice to produce infection.    The diseases that are most frequently disseminated in this way are  typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever and cholera, together with the  various illy-defined intestinal troubles of a toxic character that occur  in children, especially under the name of cholera infantum, summer  complaint, etc.    Diseases of this class are not derived directly from animals because  cattle are not susceptible to the same.    ~Modes of infection.~ In a variety of ways, however, the milk may be  subject to contaminating influences after it is drawn from the animal,  and so give opportunity for the development of disease-producing  bacteria. The more important methods of infection are as follows:    _1. Infection directly from a pre-existing case of disease on premises._  Quite frequently a person in the early stage of a diseased condition may  continue at his usual vocation as helper in the barn or dairy, and so  give opportunity for direct infection to occur. In the so-called cases  of \"walking typhoid,\" this danger is emphasized. It is noteworthy in  typhoid fever that the bacilli frequently persist in the urine and in  diphtheria they often remain in the throat until after convalescence. In  some cases infection has been traced to storage of the milk in rooms in  the house where it became polluted directly by the emanations of the  patient.[104] Among the dwellings of the lower classes where a single  room has to be used in common this source of infection has been most  frequently observed.    _2. Infection through the medium of another person._ Not infrequently  another individual may serve in the capacity of nurse or attendant to a  sick person, and also assist in the handling of the milk, either in  milking the animals or caring for the milk after it has been drawn.  Busey and Kober report twenty-one outbreaks of typhoid fever in which  dairy employees also acted in the capacity of nurses.    _3. Pollution of milk utensils._ The most frequent method of infection  of cans, pails, etc., is in cleaning them with water that may be  polluted with disease organisms. Often wells may be contaminated with  diseased matter of intestinal origin, as in typhoid fever, and the use  of water at normal temperatures, or even in a lukewarm condition, give  conditions permitting of infection.
