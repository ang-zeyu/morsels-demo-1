There were, such elegant ladies and  costumes, and such an exquisite background, the low wall and the soft  colour of the water beyond; the colour calm water takes when you look to  the East and the sun is setting behind you, the colour of a fish's  silver. And the lawn itself was fresh green; trees stood over the far  end of the Club House, and under these the band played. When the lights  began to glow along the sea wall and in the Club, and under the trees  to light the music, the Prince and the Princess, with Lady Ampthill and  Lord Lamington, came and walked up and down and spoke to people, and all  the ladies stood up from their tea tables as they passed, and I tell you  it was good; such soft glowing evening colours and gracious figures,  such groups there were to paint--my apologies for the hasty attempt  herewith. The Prince you may discover in grey frock-coat speaking to the  Bandmaster of the 10th Hussars, the Princess and Lady Ampthill near.    [Illustration]    I've worked at Saturday's pictures and Sunday's and written my journal,  and seen Royal sights all day till now, and _opus terrat_ and it is late  and hot, and the mosquitos tune up--the beast that is least eating the  beast that is biggest; the beast that is biggest to sleep if it may.          CHAPTER X      ... Went this morning with Krishnaswami of Madras--Krishna is my \"Boy,\"  and is aged about forty--to Army and Navy Stores for clothes. The  thinnest I could get at home feel very thick and hot here in this hot  November. I'd also to get photograph films, and guitar strings, and  blankets for the Boy against the cold weather--just now the mere thought  of a blanket grills one's mind--also to book shops to get books about  India, which I am pretty sure never to have time to read. In my  innocence tried to get my return tickets on P. & O. changed to another  line, and signally failed to do so. Then drew a little and loafed a good  deal on the Bundar watching the lateen-rigged boats. These boats take  passengers to Elephanta or go off to the ships in the Bay with cargoes  of brightly coloured fruits. The scene always reminds me of that  beautiful painting by Tiepolo of the landing of Queen Elizabeth in our  National Gallery--I daresay one or two Edinburgh people may know it. The  boats are about twenty feet long with narrow beam. Figures in rich  colours sit under the little awnings spread over the stern; the sailors  are naked and brown, and pole the boats to their moorings with long,  glistening bamboos, which they drive into the bottom and make fast at  stem and stern. It is pleasant to watch the play of muscle, and  attitudes, and the flicker of the reflected blue sky on their brown  perspiring backs as they swarm up the sloping yards and cotton sails to  brail up. No need for anatomy here, or at home for that matter; if an  artist can't remember the reflected blue on warm damp flesh, he does not  better matters by telling us what he has learned of the machinery  inside--that is, of course, where Michael Angelo did not quite pull it  off.    As I sat on the parapet a beautiful emerald fish some four feet long  came sailing beneath my feet in the yellowish water; a little boy  shouted with glee, and a brown naked boatman tried to gaff it, then a  brilliant butterfly, velvet black and blue, fluttered through the little  fleet; and with the colours of the draperies, of peaceful but piratical  looking men, the lateen sails, and sunlight and heat, it all felt \"truly  Oriental.\" To bring in a touch of the West, one of the \"Renown's\" white  and green launches with brass funnels rushed up and emptied a perfect  cargo of young Eastern princes in white muslins, and pink, orange, and  green turbans with floating tails to them. They clambered up the stone  slip with their bear leader and got into carriages with uniformed  drivers, six or more into each carriage quite easily; the basket trick  seems nothing to me now--they were such slips of lads--but what colour!    At lunch we talked with Miss M. She gave us the latest ship news about  our late fellow passengers--the mutual interest has not quite evaporated  yet--gave us news of the ladies who had come out to be married. She had  asked one of these as they came off the ship into the tender what it was  she carried so carefully, and the reply was, \"My wedding cake,\" and of a  poor man, she told us, who came on at Marseilles bringing out his  fiancee's trousseau, and who found on his arrival here, he had utterly  lost it! What would the latter end of that man be; would she forgive?  Could she forget? It was said that another lady, finding the natives  were in the habit of going about without clothes, booked a return  passage by the next ship.    Here is a jotting at this same landing place of the Prince and Princess  going off to the Guard Ship, but I am so sorry it is not reproduced in  colour. They were to have gone to the Caves of Elephanta across the bay,  but had not time. They apparently go on and on, without any \"eight  hour\" pause, through the procession of engagements--it must be  dreadfully fatiguing.    You see three Eurasians in foreground of the sketch, one of them with  almost white hair and white skin, and freckles and blue eyes, he might  be Irish or York shire. The two younger boys are, I think, his  brothers--they have taken more after their mother. All three are nervous  and excited watching for the Prince. They are neatly dressed in thin  clothes, through which their slightly angular figures show, and have  nervous movements of hand to mouth, and quick gentle voices, slightly  staccato, what is called \"chee chee,\" I believe.    [Illustration]    Beyond the boys you see a Parsi woman looking round. They are  conspicuous people in Bombay by their look of intense harmlessness. The  men are very tidy and wear what they probably would describe as European  clothes, trousers and long cutaway coats and white turndown collars.  Some have grey pot hats, with a round moulding instead of a brim, but  their ordinary hat is something like a mitre in black lacquer, and it  does suggest heat! They all have very brainy-looking heads from the  youth upwards, and wear glasses over eyes that have no quickness--as if  they could count but couldn't see--and they constantly move their long,  weakly hands in somewhat purposeless angular fashion; the women with  similar movements frequently pat their front hair which is plastered  down off their foreheads, and shade their eyes with their hands at a  right angle to their wrists.    I suppose they and the Bengalis are the backbone of Indian mercantile  business. Yet in \"India,\" by Sir Thomas Holdich, I read that out of the  population of 287,000,000 the Parsis do not number even one-tenth of a  million. It seems to me that we have the Parsi woman's type at home in  some of our old families, as we have remains of their Zoroastrian  fire-worship. I've seen one or two really beautiful and highly cultured,  but the average is just a little high-shouldered and floppy, and their  noses answer too closely to Gainsborough's description of Mrs Siddons'.  Mrs Siddons is just the Parsi type glorified.    We went to the ladies gymkana to-day more for the sake of the drive, I  think, than for anything else--with the utmost deference to ladies, they  can be seen at home--a few people played Badminton by lamplight; it was  dusky, damp, and warm, and heavy matting hung round the courts. Outside  an orange sunset shone through palm stems, and flying foxes as big as  fox terriers passed moth-like within arms length. From the height we  were on we looked down over the Back Bay, and far below in the twilight  we could make out the lights from a few boats on the sand, and  fishermen's lamps flickered across the mud flats, and from far out in  the west a light kept flashing from an island that was the haunt of  pirates the other day. Two more lights we saw were glowing to the  south-east in Bombay itself--one, the light of the native fair, and a  slight glow from the remains of the Bombay and Baroda Railway Offices, a  great domed building that burned up last night after the illuminations.  It was madness to cover public buildings with open oil lamps and leave  them to be looked after by natives--this huge Taj hotel, dry as tinder  outside, a complexity of dry wooden jalousies and balconies, was covered  with these lights and floating flags--how it didn't go off like a squib  was a miracle. I saw one flag gently float into a lamp, burn up and fall  in flaming shreds and no one was the wiser or the worse. The faintest  breath of air one way or the other and the other flags would have caught  fire, and in a second it would have run everywhere.    ... After the Ladies Club, pegs and billiards inside the Yacht Club, the  Bombay ladies outside on the green lawn at tea, gossip, hats, local  affairs, and Imperialism, and beyond them the ships of the fleet picked  out with electric lights along the lines of their hulls and up masts and  funnels like children's slate drawings.    It was interesting to come from the street and the crowds of Parsis and  natives all so slenderly built and watch the British youth in shirt  sleeves and thin tweeds playing billiards--they were not above the  average physique of their class, mostly young fellows who had already  been through campaigns--and you noted the muscles showing through their  thin clothes and compared them with native figures, and it did not seem  surprising that one of them could keep in order quite a number of such  wisps as the billiard markers for example. But up north they say the  natives are stronger and bigger than here.    Every now and then a boy passed round bags of chalk on hot water  enamelled plates to dry the players' hands and cues, which gives one an  idea of the damp heat of Bombay.    ... Now my friend says he's off to dress, and we go into"]]]
