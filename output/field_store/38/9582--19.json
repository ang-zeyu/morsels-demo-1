We  find, on the one hand, a deep and constant tone of individual religion  characterizing the lives of the citizens of Venice in her greatness; we  find this spirit influencing them in all the familiar and immediate  concerns of life, giving a peculiar dignity to the conduct even of their  commercial transactions, and confessed by them with a simplicity of  faith that may well put to shame the hesitation with which a man of the  world at present admits (even if it be so in reality) that religious  feeling has any influence over the minor branches of his conduct. And we  find as the natural consequence of all this, a healthy serenity of mind  and energy of will expressed in all their actions, and a habit of  heroism which never fails them, even when the immediate motive of action  ceases to be praiseworthy. With the fulness of this spirit the  prosperity of the state is exactly correspondent, and with its failure  her decline, and that with a closeness and precision which it will be  one of the collateral objects of the following essay to demonstrate from  such accidental evidence as the field of its inquiry presents. And, thus  far, all is natural and simple. But the stopping short of this religious  faith when it appears likely to influence national action,  correspondent as it is, and that most strikingly, with several  characteristics of the temper of our present English legislature, is a  subject, morally and politically, of the most curious interest and  complicated difficulty; one, however, which the range of my present  inquiry will not permit me to approach, and for the treatment of which I  must be content to furnish materials in the light I may be able to throw  upon the private tendencies of the Venetian character.    \"There is, however, another most interesting feature in the policy of  Venice, which a Romanist would gladly assign as the reason of its  irreligion; namely, the magnificent and successful struggle which she  maintained against the temporal authority of the Church of Rome. It is  true that, in a rapid survey of her career, the eye is at first arrested  by the strange drama to which I have already alluded, closed by that  ever memorable scene in the portico of St. Mark's, the central  expression in most men's thoughts of the unendurable elevation of the  pontifical power; it is true that the proudest thoughts of Venice, as  well as the insignia of her prince, and the form of her chief festival,  recorded the service thus rendered to the Roman Church. But the enduring  sentiment of years more than balanced the enthusiasm of a moment; and  the bull of Clement V., which excommunicated the Venetians and their  doge, likening them to Dathan, Abiram, Absalom, and Lucifer, is a  stronger evidence of the great tendencies of the Venetian government  than the umbrella of the doge or the ring of the Adriatic. The  humiliation of Francesco Dandolo blotted out the shame of Barbarossa,  and the total exclusion of ecclesiastics from all share in the councils  of Venice became an enduring mark of her knowledge of the spirit of the  Church of Rome, and of her defiance of it. To this exclusion of papal  influence from her councils the Romanist will attribute their  irreligion, and the Protestant their success. The first may be silenced  by a reference to the character of the policy of the Vatican itself; and  the second by his own shame, when he reflects that the English  Legislature sacrificed their principles to expose themselves to the very  danger which the Venetian senate sacrificed theirs to avoid.    \"One more circumstance remains to be noted respecting the Venetian  government, the singular unity of the families composing it,--unity far  from sincere or perfect, but still admirable when contrasted with the  fiery feuds, the almost daily revolutions, the restless succession of  families and parties in power, which fill the annals of the other states  of Italy. That rivalship should sometimes be ended by the dagger, or  enmity conducted to its ends under the mask of law, could not but be  anticipated where the fierce Italian spirit was subjected to so severe a  restraint: it is much that jealousy appears usually commingled with  illegitimate ambition, and that, for every instance in which private  passion sought its gratification through public danger, there are a  thousand in which it was sacrificed to the public advantage. Venice may  well call upon us to note with reverence, that of all the towers which  are still seen rising like a branchless forest from her islands, there  is but one whose office was other than that of summoning to prayer, and  that one was a watchtower only: from first to last, while the palaces of  the other cities of Italy were lifted into sullen fortitudes of rampart,  and fringed with forked battlements for the javelin and the bow, the  sands of Venice never sank under the weight of a war tower, and her roof  terraces were wreathed with Arabian imagery, of golden globes suspended  on the leaves of lilies.    \"These, then, appear to me to be the points of chief general interest in  the character and fate of the Venetian people. I would next endeavor to  give the reader some idea of the manner in which the testimony of art  bears upon these questions, and of the aspect which the arts themselves  assume when they are regarded in their true connection with the history  of the state: 1st. Receive the witness of painting. It will be  remembered that I put the commencement of the Fall of Venice as far back  as 1418. Now, John Bellini was born in 1423, and Titian in 1480. John  Bellini, and his brother Gentile, two years older than he, close the  line of the sacred painters of Venice. But the most solemn spirit of  religious faith animates their works to the last. There is no religion  in any work of Titian's: there is not even the smallest evidence of  religious temper or sympathies either in himself or in those for whom he  painted. His larger sacred subjects are merely themes for the exhibition  of pictorial rhetoric,--composition and color. His minor works are  generally made subordinate to purposes of portraiture. The Madonna in  the church of the Frari is a mere lay figure, introduced to form a link  of connection between the portraits of various members of the Pesaro  family who surround her. Now this is not merely because John Bellini was  a religious man and Titian was not. Titian and Bellini are each true  representatives of the school of painters contemporary with them; and  the difference in their artistic feeling is a consequence not so much of  difference in their own natural characters as in their early education:  Bellini was brought up in faith, Titian in formalism. Between the years  of their births the vital religion of Venice had expired.    \"The _vital_ religion, observe, not the formal. Outward observance was  as strict as ever; and doge and senator still were painted, in almost  every important instance, kneeling before the Madonna or St. Mark; a  confession of faith made universal by the pure gold of the Venetian  sequin. But observe the great picture of Titian's, in the ducal palace,  of the Doge Antonio Grimani kneeling before Faith: there is a curious  lesson in it. The figure of Faith is a coarse portrait of one of  Titian's least graceful female models: Faith had become carnal. The eye  is first caught by the flash of the Doge's armor. The heart of Venice  was in her wars, not in her worship. The mind of Tintoret, incomparably  more deep and serious than that of Titian, casts the solemnity of its  own tone over the sacred subjects which it approaches, and sometimes  forgets itself into devotion; but the principle of treatment is  altogether the same as Titian's: absolute subordination of the religious  subject to purposes of decoration or portraiture. The evidence might be  accumulated a thousand-fold from the works of Veronese, and of every  succeeding painter,--that the fifteenth century had taken away the  religious heart of Venice.    \"Such is the evidence of painting. To give a general idea of that of  architecture: Phillipe de Commynes, writing of his entry into Venice in  1495, observed instantly the distinction between the elder palaces and  those built 'within this last hundred years; which all have their  fronts of white marble brought from Istria, a hundred miles away, and  besides, many a large piece of porphyry and serpentine upon their  fronts.'...    \"There had indeed come a change over Venetian architecture in the  fifteenth century; and a change of some importance to us moderns: we  English owe to it our St. Paul's Cathedral, and Europe in general owes  to it the utter degradation or destruction of her schools of  architecture, never since revived.\"...    \"The Rationalist kept the arts and cast aside the religion. This  rationalistic art is the art commonly called Renaissance, marked by a  return to pagan systems, not to adopt them and hallow them for  Christianity, but to rank itself under them as an imitator and pupil. In  Painting it is headed by Giulio Romano and Nicolo Poussin; in  Architecture, by Sansovino and Palladio.    \"Instant degradation followed in every direction,--a flood of folly and  hypocrisy. Mythologies ill understood at first, then perverted into  feeble sensualities, take the place of the representations of Christian  subjects, which had become blasphemous under the treatment of men like  the Caracci. Gods without power, satyrs without rusticity, nymphs  without innocence, men without humanity, gather into idiot groups upon  the polluted canvas, and scenic affectations encumber the streets with  preposterous marble. Lower and lower declines the level of abused  intellect; the base school of landscape gradually usurps the place of  the historical painting, which had sunk into prurient pedantry,--the  Alsatian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#16)"],[1,"fts,  and four brigades of Light Horse dismounted. Attempts were made from  time to time to improve and extend the Australian position, but little  progress was made. At the same time the Turks were by no means idle for,  apart from fortifying their positions, they frequently attacked in  endeavours to drive us off their soil. The heaviest assault was on the  18th May when 30,000 fresh troops were flung at the 1st Division and the  New Zealanders. So effectually were they repulsed that the Turks begged  for an armistice for the purpose of collecting and burying the dead.    Sir Ian Hamilton, who had been strengthened by several new divisions,  planned a fresh attack for early in August. On the 6th of that month the  1st (N.S.W.) Brigade stormed Lone Pine. On the following morning attacks  were made from Steel's Post, Quinn's Post, Pope's Hill, and Russell's  Top, but all of these were unfruitful and caused heavy losses. The main  attack in the Anzac sector was, however, delivered from the left. This  commenced on the night of the 6th August and swept up the Sazli Beit and  Chailak Deres,[J] over Big Table Top, Bauchop Hill, and Rhododendron  Spur, to a position--afterwards called \"The Apex\"--within 400 yards of  the summit of Chunuk Bair.[K] A portion of the force detailed for this  advance moved up the Aghyl Dere and endeavoured to take Koja Chemin Tepe  from the west side but, after many casualties, had to entrench on some  of the under-features (Cheshire Ridge-Warwick Castle).    During the progress of this fighting the IX. Corps made a fresh landing  at Suvla Bay (6th-7th August). The combat was heavy and eventually a  junction was effected with the Australian left, but not one of the real  objectives was gained.    The operations were continued until the 29th August, on which date the  10th Light Horse, sent north to reinforce there, stormed Hill 60. This  was the last Australian attack on the Peninsula. Henceforth attention  was given solely to holding and strengthening the positions gained. The  2nd Australian Division took no part in any of these operations, but one  of its battalions--the 18th--arrived in time to join in the fighting for  the hill feature just mentioned.    The net result of the August fighting gave to the Anzac and IX. Corps a  continuous line of about 12 miles. This ran from the Brighton Beach to  the Gulf of Xeros. Behind this the depth did not average more than 1-1/4  miles but the Anzac area was enlarged from 300 acres to 8 square miles.  This gain cost the Australasians 18,000 casualties. The exhausted troops  remaining were gradually relieved by the 2nd Division pending the  further development of the British plans.           *       *       *       *       *    To return to the record of the events with which the 28th Battalion was  concerned after leaving Alexandria.    The knowledge gained during the voyage of the \"Ascanius\" enabled the  troops to settle quickly in their new quarters. In addition to the W.A.  Battalion there were on board two companies and the headquarters of the  27th Battalion. The transport, the \"Ivernia,\"[L] was a comfortable ship  of 14,000 tons register belonging to the Cunard Line. The captain and  officers at first displayed a rather cool and curt manner towards their  new passengers but in the course of a day or two visibly thawed. The  captain afterwards, in explanation, stated that from information he had  received in regard to the Australians he had expected to find in them an  absence of discipline and a tendency to \"smash things.\" He was now  agreeably surprised to discover them so tractable and  well-behaved--comparing them in a most favourable manner with other  contingents he had carried.    [Illustration: CHUNUK BAIR.  Taken from Table Top--looking East. Corner of Rhododendron Spur at top of  right-side.  _Official Photo. No. G. 1830c._  _Copyright by Australian War Museum._]    Routine was quickly instituted. Special precautions had to be taken in  regard to enemy submarines which at this time had become very active  and had lately torpedoed the \"Southland\" conveying the Brigadier and  portion of the 6th Brigade as well as the G.O.C. and Staff of the 2nd  Australian Division. News of this occurrence had reached the Battalion  just prior to embarkation and naturally excited great interest. However,  the voyage proved uneventful, the weather good, and the colours of the  sea and evening skies a never failing attraction.    Heading towards Crete, the transport skirted its western coast and  thence wended its way through the Grecian Archipelago. Arriving off  Mudros Bay, Lemnos Island, on the evening of the 8th September, it was  found that a boom was across the entrance and the harbour closed for the  night. Nothing remained to be done but to stand on and off during the  hours of darkness. To cast anchor would have rendered the ship an easy  prey to the underwater craft. The sight of the \"Southland\" on a  neighbouring beach lent point to this possibility.    Shortly after sunrise the appearance of a British destroyer coming from  the direction of the Bay indicated that the entrance was now open.  Threading its way between numbers of British and French men-of-war and  other vessels the transport came to rest something less than a mile from  the shore.    Anchored in the vicinity was the R.M.S. \"Aragon,\" now used as quarters  for the Inspector-General of the Line of Communications and his staff.  From this source orders were received to disembark the Battalion on the  following day. The arrangements necessary were few, consequently there  was little to do and most of the afternoon was spent in bathing at the  ship's side or in writing letters. Word had gone forth that the last  mail before reaching Gallipoli would close that night. So numerous were  the missives that it was found necessary to make every available officer  a censor for the time being in order that delay might be avoided. The  writings, as usual, were apropos of the occasion but it was found that  one man, anticipating events, had informed his mother that he was  writing his few words \"by the light of the bursting shells.\"    Disembarkation was to commence at 2 p.m. on the 10th September but the  movement proved to be merely a transhipment to the Weymouth-Channel  Islands packet boat \"Sarnia\" which arrived, after a delay of one and  a-half hours, and tied up alongside the transport. Coincident with this  there appeared several staff officers delegated to \"assist.\" The Senior  Naval Transport Officer, a captain in the Royal Navy, endeavoured to  make up the 90 minutes lost by urging speed in the move from one ship to  the other. When the futility of expecting fully equipped men to move  quickly over the solitary 15-inch plank laid down as a gangway was  pointed out to him, he showed signs of irritability and threatened an  adverse report on the handling of the troops. On being informed that it  was his privilege to make such a report he left the ship. However, he  was later observed in altercation with the skipper of the smaller vessel  and eventually a second gangway was rigged. When this move was commenced  there was room on the main deck for two companies only. The other two  were kept clear and their officers took refuge on the boat deck. There  they were found, reclining in chairs, by another staff officer duly  be-tabbed, trousered, brogued, and carrying a cane. He seemed to be  amazed at the indifference of the Australians to their impending move  and burst out \"I say, you fellows, do you know that you've got to be off  this ---- ship in half an hour?\" Being greeted with roars of laughter he  disappeared down the companionway calling plaintively, \"Where's the  Colonel? Where's the Colonel?\"    Within ten minutes of the time originally allowed, the Battalion had  passed over to the \"Sarnia.\" As she sheered off loud cheers were given  for the captain of the \"Ivernia\" and groans for one of his officers whom  the men considered had been, on the voyage, over niggardly with the  rations. The packet boat, her decks rather tightly packed with troops,  moved down the Bay between the lines of the warships, whose crews  cheered and cheered again those now leaving for the front. Darkness was  falling as the transport entered the open sea and steamed at 17 knots in  the direction of Anzac--60 miles away to the north-east.    Some two hours elapsed and then star shells, bursting over Achi Baba,  near the Southern end of the Peninsula, gave the newcomers a first  glimpse of the \"real war.\" Later on the guns could be heard and shell  explosions witnessed on the plain of Helles where the VIII. Corps and  the French had been for the previous five months. Keen were the watchers  on the deck of the \"Sarnia\" and keener still they became as the rugged  mass of Sari Bair loomed out of the sea. It was then known that the end  of the journey was at hand.    Nearing the Peninsula at this point--opposite Williams' Pier--resembled  somewhat an approach to Mt. Eliza on a dark night by boat from Perth  Water. Lights shone out from dugouts constructed in the steep slopes,  moving lights were discerned on the beach beneath, and the crest line  was in darkness except when now and then illuminated by the flash of a  bomb, shell, or gun. The simile could be pursued no further, for to  those who had not yet been in action the noise going on seemed to  indicate that some fierce fighting must be in progress. The dull but  powerful thud of exploding hand bombs, the sharper crashing explosion of  shell, the report of a discharging gun and the roar of its projectile,  echoed and re-echoed, in its flight along one of the numerous ravines,  induced belief that very little time must elapse before the 28th would  be \"in it.\" It turned out otherwise, however, and subsequent experience  showed that these signs and sounds were the mere accompaniment of a  \"quiet night.\"    [Illustration: WILLIAMS' PIER.
