D., and who had put a few  questions to her when here at the farm, questions which she had  answered quite correctly. At Stuttgart there was a larger circle of  listeners, and Lola sat in their midst upon a table. Fraeulein M. D.  stood beside me, and I asked her to put the question. I do not now  remember what the question was, but I had extended my hand for the  reply. Lola, however, turned to the speaker, and tapped the correct  answer on that lady's arm, giving the second--and equally good one on  Fraeulein M. D.'s proffered hand. Lola is also in the habit of answering  my people with either \"yes\" or \"no\" as the case may be, and on one  occasion--when I was away from home, having gone to Munich for three  weeks--she remained with Frau Kindermann at Hohenheim, and during that  time, gave replies to all kind of questions put to her by that lady, as  the following report will show:        \"REPORT OF FRAU PROFESSOR KINDERMANN IN HOHENHEIM        \"On my asking Lola: 'Where is your mistress?' she      answered--'minchen!' (Muenchen). When I showed her the portrait of      my son Karl and asked--'Of whom is this a picture?' Lola at once      replied 'Karli.' On 28 October, I received a hamper of vegetables      from my mother--known to Lola as 'Mama,' to whom she had been on a      visit at Easter. Lola sniffed all the hamper over, then jumped      about and wagged her tail joyfully--so I inquired: 'Do you know who      the hamper is from?' 'Yes!' 'Then tell me!' 'Mama!' She did a few      sums with me every day; told the time; the days of the week, and      the temperature. Several acquaintances bore witness to the good      work she did--and Lola told them her age--after she had been given      the year of her birth. If I happened to be absent minded, Lola knew      at once how to deceive me, for she seemed then, instinctively aware      that I was not a match for her.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    Lola also solved many little sums set her by my friend, Fraeulein M. D.  (at the time that lady had been staying with me on the farm to gain  first-hand experience in the work), and on one occasion when Fraeulein  M. D. said, \"Where is your mistress?\" Lola spelt out that I was in the  \"segenhaus,\" which was quite true, I having told her shortly before  that I was going there. To the great amusement of the maids, Lola  sometimes elected to work in the kitchen, with the little  seven-year-old son of the housekeeper, and it is reported that her  answers were frequently right. I feel sure, in fact, that Lola would  work with anyone who was adapted to work with her, and that she would  give as good an account of herself, with them, as she does with me.          THE QUESTION OF POSSIBLE INFLUENCE      Eighteenth May, 1916. Lola, who since the middle of April has been  accustomed to giving her own independent, and often lengthy, answers,  was now rapping very well. Her replies were to the point, decidedly  apt, and often quite unexpected. Moreover she usually stuck obstinately  to her own way--should I happen to think that something was incorrect,  until--on giving in--I sometimes had to acknowledge that she had been  right after all. Now, on the 18 May I said to her: \"Lola, you must  write to my father and thank him for the biscuits, he will then send  you some more. This is the way to write a letter, one begins--'dear  Father,' or just 'dear,' and then one tells what one is thinking about,  you must, therefore, thank him--and when the letter is finished--you  must put 'love from Lola'.\" Now then--begin. Lola started rapping out  without further delay, and continued rapidly and \"fluently\"--so to  speak--her letter running as follows: \"lib, nach uns kom, ich una ...\"  (here I interrupted her, believing her about to say \"ich und Henny\")  and asked \"is this right?\" She said it was: \"but, Lola,\" I urged, \"be  sure you are careful! ought this not to be a 'd'?\" \"No!\" she said. I  was at a loss to make out where this \"a\" came in, but told her to go  on--and Lola rapped: \"... artig eben, oft we, kus ich!\" So the \"una\"  had been part of \"unartig\"! ( = \"dear, come to us, I have just been  naughty, often pains, kiss (you) I.\" Here she showed that she was quite  certain in her own mind, and that in spite of my suggestions as to the  form her letter should take, she was yet bent on following her own  ideas, since there was no trace of \"thanks!\" Besides which, instead of  concluding with \"Lola,\" as I had proposed her doing, she elected to  assert herself by putting _ich_ = \"I!\") \"Naughty\" referred, probably to  a _strafe_ she had had about a quarter of an hour earlier for chasing  the game, and the \"often pain\" to headache and to being tired. Anyway,  this letter seems a brilliant proof of \"independent thinking,\" and I  shall be able to give several more equally fresh and original replies  in a later chapter.[19]          [19] Chapter XVIII, \"Spontaneous Answers.\"    Up to this time, it had only been in the matter of _replies_ that I had  been able to obtain independent communications, but, on 27 May, there  was a new development to record: I had avoided asking her any questions  for several days, for I had noticed that she seemed extremely tired.  But by this day I thought she would probably be fit to do a reasonable  amount of work: I have always abstained from this if she showed signs  of evident fatigue. So I now asked her: \"Lola! how is it you always  know when my friend is coming? you knew it before she entered the house  this morning!\" \"Gehoert,\" ( = heard) was the reply. \"Then, if you know  hers--do you know the sounds made by every one?\" \"No.\" \"Only those whom  you know well?\" \"Yes.\" Then Lola began wagging her tail near to the  door, so I asked: \"Who was outside?\" Lola gave a \"g,\" and then  corrected it with \"no.\" From her delight, I was inclined to think that  it had been Frieda, a young girl who had been studying farming with me,  and that this was the name Lola was about to rap out. So I discounted  the \"g\" and the \"no\" and said: \"It should be 'f'--shouldn't it?\" (note:  g = 17, f = 16.) Whereupon Lola continued and rapped--_Frieda_. I then  looked out and saw to my astonishment that it was Guste, a new maid who  had been in the house about a week. I said to Lola at once: \"You were  wrong, it was not Frieda, but the new maid--what is her name?\" Lola  began again----\" ... \"and again added \"no ...\" \"Don't you know her  name?\" I inquired--but Lola replied \"yes!\" I turned the matter over in  my mind, wondering how she had come to rap \"Frieda\" instead of \"Guste,\"  and finally said to her: \"Why did you give me a wrong answer, saying  Frieda when it was Guste?\" and Lola responded with, \"You think!\"  \"What?\" said I, \"did you _feel_ what I was thinking?\" \"Yes.\" \"And do  you _always_ feel what I think?\" \"Yes.\"    This was something quite new, but I explained it to myself, and my view  has proved to be correct in all subsequent tests undertaken by me. It  is this: _Dogs are susceptible to thought-transference--also, that  they are more particularly open to this when tired and when lazy.  Further--they are open to such thought-transference even when not  actually aware of the question--as for instance, in the present case,  where it was a matter of the new servant's name, for here Lola had been  able to \"tap\" my thoughts with respect to what was familiar to  her_--(i.e. the name of the other maid) _but_ (and this is the most  important point)--_a dog cannot receive impressions in respect of  matters of which it has no knowledge_!    For example, here Lola could not spell \"Guste\" in spite of the fact  that I was expecting it quite as intently as I had looked for \"Frieda\"  in the first instance; and what is more--I cannot get the dog to \"take  up\" a new thought should she have already \"made up her mind\" about a  matter, as on the occasion when she had been \"naughty.\" It has  constantly happened that Lola has held out against me in the matter of  some figure in her sums and that--later on--I have found myself to have  been at fault, this showing that the numerals \"pictured\" in my mind can  have made no impression on hers; yet, on the other hand, it has also  happened that she has accepted my inaccuracies--simply because she was  tired, and did not want the trouble of \"thinking for herself.\" Indeed,  I could see as much in her eyes--there would be a sense of inertia  about her, which indicated that she was only waiting to \"guess\" by  means of _feeling_--a willing receptacle, as it were, ready to receive  my thoughts. I have often made the attempt at \"thinking\" _new_ things  into her head--but have found this quite impossible.    Shortly after what has here been related, Lola became a \"slacker\" in  the matter of thinking, and kept this up for days. As this pose made it  impossible for me to put a serious test, I had recourse for some time  to questions only, and--moreover--to questions as to which I could not  be sure of the answer, without some trouble or calculation on my own  part, for I felt that I might otherwise have really lost my patience  with her--unless I had kept on strenuously suggesting the answer--as,  for instance: \"the stove is green!\" Nor did I feel that I could have  entirely relied on the inactivity of my subconsciousness, while thus  intently thinking. So I kept to such questions as--\"What will be the  day of the week on such and such a date?\" (Naming a date about three  weeks ahead.) This precluded any possibility of thought-transference,  for I simply ignored reckoning out the days myself. By the way, it is  astounding that dogs should be receptive to thought-transference,  though there are, of course, many proofs of a dog's acute and delicate  susceptibility in relation to the thoughts of human beings, as well as  a certain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#16)"],[1,"y's party observed it stunk worse  than a fox, to which Mr Fox replied, there was nothing extraordinary in  that, considering it was a poll-cat.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [45] \"Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, R.A,\" by his son, W.  Wilkie Collins, i. p. 222.          DOGS.      One who seems to love the race of dogs, and who has written a most  readable book on them,[47] remarks, that the dog \"even now is rarely the  companion of a Jew, or the inmate of his house.\" He quotes various terms  of reproach still common among us, and which seem to have originated  from a similar feeling to that of the Jew. For instance, we say of a  very cheap article, that it is \"dog cheap.\" To call a person \"a dog,\" or  \"a cur,\" or \"a hound,\" means something the very opposite of  complimentary. A surly person is said to have \"a dogged disposition.\"  Any one very much fatigued is said to be \"dog weary.\" A wretched room or  house is often called \"a dog hole,\" or said to be only fit for \"a dog.\"  Very poor verse is \"doggerel.\" It is told of Lady Mary Wortley  Montague, that when a young nobleman refused to translate some  inscription over an alcove, because it was in \"dog-latin,\" she observed,  \"How strange a puppy shouldn't understand his mother tongue.\"    What, too, can be more expressive of a man being on the verge of ruin,  than the common phrase, that \"such a one is going to the dogs.\" Of  modern describers of the very life and feelings of dogs, who can surpass  Dr John Brown of Edinburgh? His \"Rab,\" and his \"Our Dogs,\" are worthy of  the brush of Sir Edwin Landseer. Who has not heard the answer _said_ to  have been given by Sydney Smith to the great painter, when he wanted to  make a portrait of the witty canon, \"_Is thy servant a dog, that he  should do this thing?_\"    There is great diversity of standard in matters of taste. In China, a  well-roasted pup, of any variety of the very variable _Canis  familiaris_, is a dainty dish. In London the greatest exquisite delights  in the taste of a half-cooked woodcock, but would scruple to eat a  lady's lap-dog, even though descended, by indubitable pedigree, from a  genuine \"liver-and-tan\" spaniel, that followed King Charles II. in his  strolls through St James's Park; and which was given to her ladyship's  ancestress on a day recorded, perhaps, in the diary of Mr Samuel Pepys.  Again, in the country of the Esquimaux, who has not read in the  intensely interesting narratives of the Moravian missionaries, how the  dogs of the \"Innuit\"--of \"the men,\" as they call themselves--are, in  winter, indispensable to their very existence? Parry, Lyon, Franklin,  Richardson, Ross, Rae, Penny, Sutherland, Inglefield, and Kane, have  told us what excellent \"carriage\"-pullers these hardy children of the  snow become from early infancy; and how the more they work, like the  wives of savages in Australia, the more they are kicked. Passing over  the dogs of the Indian tribes of North America and the gaunt race in  Patagonia, the reader may remember that the Roman youth, like the young  Briton, had, in the days of Horace, his outer marks--one was, that he  loved to have a dog, or a whole pack beside him--\"_gaudet canibus_.\"  This attachment to the dog is given us \"from above,\" and is one of the  many \"good gifts\" which proceed from Him, who made man and dog  \"familiar,\" as the apt specific name of Linnaeus denominates the latter.  One of our greatly-gifted poets, in a cynical mood, could write an  epitaph on a favourite Newfoundlander, and end it with the dismal lines  on his views of \"earthly friends\"--       \"He never knew but one,--and here he lies.\"    Our genial and home-loving Cowper has made his dog Beau classical. We  must beg our readers to refresh their memories, by looking into the  Olney bard's exquisite story,       \"My spaniel, prettiest of his race,     And high in pedigree,\"    and they will find that _that_ story of \"The Dog and the Water-lily\" was  \"no fable,\" and that Beau really understood his master's wish when he  fetched him a water-lily out of \"Ouse's silent tide.\" How graceful are  the last two stanzas of that sweet little poem--       \"Charm'd with the sight, 'The world,' I cried,       'Shall hear of this thy deed;     My dog shall mortify the pride       Of man's superior breed.       'But chief myself I will enjoin,       Awake at duty's call,     To show a love as prompt as thine       To Him who gives me all.'\"[48]    [Illustration: BEAU.]    That the world might know the very \"mark and figure\" of this spaniel,  the late able illustrator of so many topographical works (Mr James  Storer) published in his \"Rural Walks of Cowper\"[49] a figure of Beau,  from the stuffed skin in the possession of Cowper's kinsman, the Rev.  Dr Johnson.    Mr Montague, in a letter to the son and biographer of Sir James  Mackintosh,[50] gives many reminiscences of that eminent man, who was  much attached to the memory of Cowper. He says, \"We reached Dereham  about mid-day (it was in 1801), and wrote to Mr Johnson, the clergyman,  who had protected Cowper in the last years of his life, and in whose  house he died. He instantly called upon us, and we accompanied him to  his house. In the hall, we were introduced to a little red and white  spaniel, in a glass case--the little dog Beau, who, seeing the  water-lily which Cowper could not reach, 'plunging, left the shore.'\"       \"I saw him with that lily cropp'd,       Impatient swim to meet     My quick approach, and soon he dropp'd       The treasure at my feet.\"    We saw the room where Cowper died, and the bell which he last touched.  We went to his grave, and to Mrs Unwin's, who is buried at some  distance. I lamented this, \"Do not live in the visible, but the  invisible,\" said your father,--\"his attainments, his tenderness, his  affections, his sufferings, and his hardships, will live long after both  their graves are no more.\"    We could linger over a prized octavo volume, published in Edinburgh in  1787; the first poem of this, \"The Twa Dogs, a Tale,\" occupies some  thirteen pages, written with that \"rare felicity\" so common to _the_  Bard of Scotland. We mention it, because of the peculiar happiness with  which the collie, or Scottish shepherd-dog, is described in lines that  Sir Edwin Landseer alone has equalled on canvas, or his brother Thomas  with the graver--       \"He was a gash an' faithfu' tyke     As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.     His honest, sonsie, bawsn't[51] face,     Aye gat him friends in ilka place.     His breast was white, his touzie back     Weel clad wi' coat of glossy black;     His gaucie tail, wi' upward curl,     Hung owre his hurdies wi' a swirl.\"    _That's_ the shepherd-dog, as we have heard him described from a  specimen, which was the friend and follower of a valued one, who, when a  boy ('tis many years ago), frisked with the dog, over _one_ of the many  ferny haughs that margin the lovely Tweed above and below Peebles. It is  _the_ collie we have seen, on one of the sheep-farms of Lanarkshire,  obey its young master by a word or two, as unintelligible to us as  Japanese. But to the Culter \"Luath,\" to hear was to obey; and in a  quarter of an hour a flock of sheep, which had been feeding on a  hillSide half a mile off, were brought back, driven by this faithful  \"bit doggie.\" We wonder not that shepherds love their dogs. Why, even  the New Smithfield cattle-drovers, who drive sheep along the streets of  London on a Monday or Friday, never even require to urge their faithful  partners. Well may the gifted authoress of \"The Dream\" address \"the  faithful guardian\"--       \"Oh, tried and trusted! thou whose love       Ne'er changes nor forsakes,     Thou proof, how perfect God hath stamp'd       The meanest thing He makes;     Thou, whom no snare entraps to serve,       No art is used to tame     (Train'd, like ourselves, thy path to know,       By words of love and blame);     Friend! who beside the cottage door,       Or in the rich man's hall,     With steadfast faith still answerest       The one familiar call;     Well by poor hearth and lordly home       Thy couchant form may rest,     And Prince and Peasant trust thee still,       To guard what they love best.\"       _Hon. Mrs Norton, \"The Dream,\" &c._, p. 192.    No ordinary-sized volume, much less a short article, could give a tithe  of the true anecdotes of members of the dog race. Mere references to  their biography would take up a volume of Bibliography itself, just as  their forms, and character, and \"pose,\" give endless subject to the  painter. Of modern authors, no one loved dogs more truly than Sir Walter  Scott, as the reader of his writings and of his biography is well  aware;[52] but it may not be generally known that, on the only occasion  when the great novelist met the Ayrshire peasant,--       \"Virgilium tantum vidi,\"--    the poem, which had made Burns a wonder to the boy then \"unknown,\" was  that of \"The Twa Dogs;\" so that, even then, Scott had commenced to show  his attachment to these faithful followers. It was in the house of Sir  Adam Ferguson, when Scott was a mere lad; and the scene was described  most vividly to the writer by the late Scottish knight, after whose  battle in South Italy the author of \"Marmion\" named his pet staghound  Maida, or, as Scott pronounced it, \"Myda.\" It was as the author of \"The  Twa Dogs\" that young Ferguson and Scott regarded Burns on his entrance  into the room with such wistful attention. The story is told in  Lockhart, and we will not quote it further; but, leaving dogs of our own  days and lands to Mr Jesse, who has given an interesting volume on them,  we will close with a few paragraphs on the dog of the East--a very  differently treated animal to that generally prized and esteemed  \"friend\" of man in these lands of the West.    The Holy Scriptures show us that dogs were generally despised. We select  three, out of many instances. \"Is thy servant a _dog_ that he should do  this thing?\" was the"]]]
