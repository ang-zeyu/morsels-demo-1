They  had so many brass buttons on their clothes it looked like gold. So he  run and told his mama, and she looked and saw it was soldiers, and some  of 'em told the boss, and he looked and saw them soldiers comin' in the  big gate and he called 'em in quick, and told them they were free. So  when the soldiers come, they asked him if he had told his slaves they  were free, and he said yes. They asked the Negroes if they lived there,  and they said yes. One said, 'He just told us we was free.' The soldiers  asked him why he had just told them, and he said they wasn't all there  and he was waiting for them all to be there.    \"My husband said he thought them was the prettiest bunch of men he ever  saw, and the prettiest horses. Of course, he hadn't never saw any  soldiers before. I know it looked pretty to me when I used to see the  soldiers at the barracks and hear the band playin' and see them drillin'  and ever'thing. You see, we lived on a little cross-street right back of  St. Mary's Church in San Antonio, I don't know how that place is now.  Where the post office is now, there used to be a blacksmith shop and my  father worked there. I went back to San Antonio about fifteen years ago  and jes' took it afoot and looked at the changes.    \"I was fifteen years old the first time I married. It was almost a  run-a-way marriage. I was married in San Antonio. My first husband's  name was Henry Hall. My first wedding dress was as wide as a wagon  sheet. It was white lawn, full of tucks, and had a big ruffle at the  bottom. I had a wreath and a veil, too. The veil had lace all around it.  We danced and had a supper. We danced all the dances they danced then;  the waltz, square, quadrille, polka, and the gallopade--and that's what  it was, all right; you shore galloped. You'd start from one end of the  hall and run clear to the other end. In those days, the women with all  them long trains--the man would hold it over his arm. No, Lord!  Honeymoons wasn't thought of then. No'm, I never worked out a day in my  life.\" Jokingly, \"I guess they thought I was too good looking. I was  about twenty years old when I married the second time. I was married in  Leon Springs the second time.    \"Before we come out to this country from Leon Springs, they was wild  grapes, dewberries, plums and agaritas, black haws, red haws. M-m-m!  Them dewberries, I dearly love 'em! I never did see wild cherries out  here. I didn't like the cherries much, but they make fine wine. We used  to gather mustang grapes and make a barrel of wine.    \"After I married the second time, we lived on the Adams ranch on the  Frio and stayed on that ranch fifteen years. We raised all our chillen  right on that ranch. I am taken for a Mexkin very often. I jes' talk  Mexkin back to 'em. I learned to talk it on the ranch. As long as I have  lived at this place, I have never had a cross word about the chillen.  All my neighbors here is Mexkins. They used to laugh at me when I tried  to talk to the hands on the ranch, but I learned to talk like 'em.    \"We used to have big round-ups out on the Adams ranch. They had fences  then. The neighbors would all come over and get out and gather the  cattle and bring 'em in. Up at Leon Springs at that time they didn't  have any fences, and they would have big round-ups there. But after we  come out here, it was different. He would notify his neighbors they were  goin' to gather cattle on a certain day. The chuck wagon was right there  at the ranch, that is, _I_ was the chuck wagon. But if they were goin' to  take the cattle off, they would have a chuck wagon. They would round up  a pasture at a time and come in to the ranch for their meals. Now on the  Wallace ranch, they would always take a chuck wagon. When they were  gettin' ready to start brandin' at the ranch, my husband always kep' his  brandin' irons all in the house, hangin' up right where he could get his  hands on 'em. Whenever they would go off to other ranches to gather  cattle, you would see ever' man with his beddin' tied up behind him on  his horse. He'd have jes' a small roll. They would always have a slicker  if nothin' else. That slicker answered for ever'thing sometimes. My  husband slep' many a night with his saddle under his head.    \"He used to carry mail from San Antonio to Dog Town, horseback. That was  the town they used to call Lodi (Lodo), but I don't know how to spell  it, and don't know what it means. It was a pretty tough town. The jail  house was made out of 'dobe and pickets. They had a big picket fence all  around it. They had a ferry that went right across the San Antonio River  from Floresville to Dog Town. I know he told me he come to a place and  they had a big sign that said, 'Nigga, don't let the sun go down on you  here.' They was awful bad down in there. He would leave Dog Town in the  evenin' and he would get to a certain place up toward San Antonio to  camp, and once he stopped before he got to the place he always camped  at. He said he didn't know what made 'im stop there that time, but he  stopped and took the saddle off his horse and let 'im graze while he lay  down. After a while, he saw two cigarette fires in the dark right up the  road a little piece, and he heard a Mexkin say, 'I don't see why he's so  late tonight. He always gets here before night and camps right there.'  He knew they was waylayin' 'im, so he picked his saddle up right easy  and carried it fu'ther back down the road in the brush and then come got  his horse and took him out there and saddled 'im up and went away 'round  them Mexkins. He went on in to San Antonio and didn't go back any more.  A white man took the mail to carry then and the first trip he made, he  never come back. He went down with the mail and they found the mail  scattered somewhere on the road, but they never found the man, or the  horse, either.    \"On the Adams ranch, in the early days, we used to have to pack water up  the bank. You might not believe it, but one of these sixty-pound lard  cans full of water, I've a-carried it on my head many a time. We had  steps cut into the bank, and it was a good ways down to the water, and  I'd pack that can up to the first level and go back and get a couple a  buckets of water, and carry a bucket in each hand and the can on my head  up the next little slantin' hill before I got to level ground. I carried  water that way till my chillen got big enough to carry water, then they  took it up. When I was carryin' water in them big cans my head would  sound like new leather--you know how it squeaks, and that was the way it  sounded in my head. But, it never did hurt me. You see, the Mexkins  carry loads on their heads, but they fix a rag around their heads some  way to help balance it. But I never did. I jes' set it up on my head and  carried it that way. Oh, we used to carry water! My goodness! My mother  said it was the Indian in me--the way I could carry water.    \"When we were first married and moved to the Adams ranch, we used to  come here to Uvalde to dances. They had square dances then. They hadn't  commenced all these frolicky dances they have now. They would have a  supper, but they had it to sell. Every fellow would have to treat his  girl he danced with.    \"I can remember when my grandfather lived in a house with a dirt floor,  and they had a fireplace. And I can remember just as well how he used to  bake hoecakes for us kids. He would rake back the coals and ashes real  smooth and put a wet paper down on that and then lay his hoecake down on  the paper and put another paper on top of that and the ashes on top. I  used to think that was the best bread I ever ate. I tried it a few  times, but I made such a mess I didn't try it any more. One thing I have  seen 'em make, especially on the ranch. You take and clean a stick and  you put on a piece of meat and piece of fat till you take and use up the  heart and liver and sweetbread and other meat and put it on the stick  and wrap it around with leaf fat and then put the milk gut, or marrow  gut, around the whole thing. They call that _macho_ (mule), and I tell  you, it's good. They make it out of a goat and sheep, mostly.    \"Another thing, we used to have big round-ups, and I have cooked great  pans of steak and mountain orshters. Generally, at the brandin' and  markin', I cooked up many a big pan of mountain orshters. I wish I had a  nickel for ever' one I've cooked, and ate too! People from up North have  come down there, and, when they were brandin' and cuttin' calves there,  they sure did eat and enjoy that dinner.    \"The men used to go up to the lake, fishin', and catch big trout, or  bass, they call 'em now; and we'd take big buckets of butter--we didn't  take a saucer of butter or a pound; we taken butter up there in buckets,  for we sure had plenty of it--and we'd take lard too, and cook our fish  up there, and had corn bread or hoe cakes and plenty of butter for  ever'thing, and it sure was good. I tell you--like my husband used to  say--we was livin' ten days in the week, then.    \"When we killed hogs, the meat from last winter was hung outside and  then new meat, salted down and then smoked, put in there, and we would  cook the old bacon for the dogs. We always kep' some good dogs there,  and anybody'll tell you they was always fat. We had lots of wild turkeys  and I raised turkeys, too, till I got sick of cookin' turkeys. Don't  talk about deer! You know, it wasn't then like it is now. You could go  kill venison any time you wanted to. But I don't blame 'em for passin'  that law, for people used to go kill 'em and jes' take out the hams and  tenderloin and leave the other layin' there. I have saved many a sack of  dried meat to keep it from spoilin'.    \"We would raise watermelons, too. We had a big field three mile from the  house and a ninety-acre field right in the house. We used to go get  loads of melons for the hogs and they got to where they didn't eat  anything but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3066"],[0,"The Red Man's Continent: A Chronicle of Aboriginal America (#16)"],[1," learned to express itself in durable  architectural forms like those of Mexico, nor could it rival the older  type in social and religious organization. In political organization,  however, the Five Nations had surpassed the other aboriginal peoples of  North America. When the white man became acquainted with the Iroquois in  the seventeenth century, he found five of their tribes organized into  a remarkable confederation whose avowed object was to abolish war among  themselves and to secure to all the members the peaceful exercise of  their rights and privileges. So well was the confederation organized  that, in spite of war with its enemies, it persisted for at least two  hundred years. One of the chief characteristics of the Iroquois was  their tremendous energy. They were so energetic that they pursued  their enemies with an implacable relentlessness similar to the restless  eagerness with which the people of the region from New York to Chicago  now pursue their business enterprises. This led the Iroquois to torture  their prisoners with the utmost ingenuity and cruelty. Not only did the  savages burn and mutilate their captives, but they sometimes added the  last refinement of torture by compelling the suffering wretches to  eat pieces of flesh cut from their own bodies. Energy may lead to  high civilization, but it may also lead to excesses of evil. The third  prominent aboriginal type was that of the fishermen of the coast of  British Columbia, especially the Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands.  The most important features of their environment were the submerged  coast with its easy navigation, the mild oceanic climate, and the dense  pine forests. The Haidas, like the Iroquois, appear to have been a  people who were still advancing. Such as it was, their greatness was  apparently the product of their own ingenuity and not, like that of  the Mexicans, an inheritance from a greater past. The Haidas lacked the  relentless energy of the Iroquois and shared the comparatively gentle  character which prevailed among all the Indians along the Pacific Coast.  They were by no means weaklings, however. Commercially, for instance,  they seem to have been more advanced than any North American tribe  except those in the Mexican area. In architecture they stood equally  high. We are prone to think of the Mexicans as the best architects among  the aborigines, but when the white man came even the Aztecs were merely  imitating the work of their predecessors. The Haidas, on the contrary,  were showing real originality. They had no stone with which to build,  for their country is so densely forested that stone is rarely visible.  They were remarkably skillful, however, in hewing great beams from the  forest. With these they constructed houses whose carved totem poles and  graceful facades gave promise of an architecture of great beauty. Taking  into account the difficulties presented by a material which was not  durable and by tools which were nothing but bits of stone, we must  regard their totem poles and mural decorations as real contributions to  primitive architecture.    In addition to these three highest types of the red man there were many  others. Each, as we shall see, owed its peculiarities largely to the  physical surroundings in which it lived. Of course different tribes  possessed different degrees of innate ability, but the chief differences  in their habits and mode of life arose from the topography, the climate,  the plants, and the animals which formed the geographical setting of  their homes.    In previous chapters we have gained some idea of the topography of the  New World and of the climate in its relation to plants and animals. We  have also seen that climate has much to do with human energy. We have  not, however, gained a sufficiently clear idea of the distribution  of climatic energy. A map of the world showing how energy would be  distributed if it depended entirely upon climate clarifies the subject.  The dark shading of the map indicates those regions where energy is  highest. It is based upon measurements of the strength of scores  of individuals, upon the scholastic records of hundreds of college  students, upon the piecework of thousands of factory operatives, and  upon millions of deaths and births in a score of different countries. It  takes account of three chief climatic conditions--temperature, humidity,  and variability. It also takes account of mental as well as physical  ability. Underneath it is a map of the distribution of civilization  on the basis of the opinion of fifty authorities in fifteen different  countries. The similarity of the two maps is so striking that there can  be little question that today the distribution of civilization agrees  closely with the distribution of climatic energy. When Egypt, Babylonia,  Greece, and Rome were at the height of their power this agreement was  presumably the same, for the storm belt which now gives variability  and hence energy to the thickly shaded regions in our two maps then  apparently lay farther south. It is generally considered that no race  has been more closely dependent upon physical environment than were the  Indians. Why, then, did the energizing effect of climate apparently have  less effect upon them than upon the other great races? Why were not  the most advanced Indian tribes found in the same places where white  civilization is today most advanced? Climatic changes might in part  account for the difference, but, although such changes apparently  took place on a large scale in earlier times, there is no evidence of  anything except minor fluctuations since the days of the first white  settlements. Racial inheritance likewise may account for some of the  differences among the various tribes, but it was probably not the chief  factor. That factor was apparently the condition of agriculture among  people who had neither iron tools nor beasts of burden. Civilization  has never made much progress except when there has been a permanent  cultivation of the ground. It has been said that \"the history of  agriculture is the history of man in his most primitive and most  permanent aspect.\" If we examine the achievements and manner of life of  the Indians in relation to the effect of climate upon agriculture and  human energy, as well as in relation to the more obvious features  of topography and vegetation, we shall understand why the people of  aboriginal America in one part of the continent differed so greatly from  those in another part. In the far north the state of the inhabitants  today is scarcely different from what it was in the days of Columbus.  Then, as now, the Eskimos had practically no political or social  organization beyond the family or the little group of relatives who  lived in a single camp. They had no permanent villages, but moved from  place to place according to the season in search of fish, game, and  birds. They lived this simple life not because they lacked ability but  because of their surroundings. Their kayaks or canoes are marvels of  ingenuity. With no materials except bones, driftwood, and skins they  made boats which fulfilled their purpose with extraordinary perfection.  Seated in the small, round hole which is the only opening in the deck  of his canoe, the Eskimo hunter ties his skin jacket tightly outside  the circular gunwale and is thus shut into a practically water-tight  compartment. Though the waves dash over him, scarcely a drop enters the  craft as he skims along with his double paddle among cakes of floating  ice. So, too, the snowhouse with its anterooms and curved entrance  passage is as clever an adaptation to the needs of wanderers in a land  of ice and snow as is the skyscraper to the needs of a busy commercial  people crowded into great cities. The fact that the oilburning,  soapstone lamps of the Eskimo were the only means of producing  artificial light in aboriginal America, except by ordinary fires, is  another tribute to the ingenuity of these northerners. So, too, is the  fire-drill by which they alone devised a means of increasing the speed  with which one stick could be twirled against another to produce fire.  In view of these clever inventions it seems safe to say that the Eskimo  has remained a nomadic savage not because he lacks inventive skill but  partly because the climate deadens his energies and still more because  it forbids him to practice agriculture.    Southward and inland from the coastal homes of the Eskimo lies the great  region of the northern pine forests. It extends from the interior of  Alaska southeastward in such a way as to include most of the Canadian  Rockies, the northern plains from Great Bear Lake almost to Lake  Winnipeg, and most of the great Laurentian shield around Hudson Bay and  in the peninsula of Labrador. Except among the inhabitants of the narrow  Pacific slope and those of the shores of Labrador and the St. Lawrence  Valley, a single type of barbarism prevailed among the Indians of all  the vast pine forest area. Only in a small section of the wheat-raising  plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan have their habits greatly changed  because of the arrival of the white man. Now as always the Indians in  these northern regions are held back by the long, benumbing winters.  They cannot practice agriculture, for no crops will grow. They cannot  depend to any great extent upon natural vegetation, for aside from  blueberries, a few lichens, and one or two other equally insignificant  products, the forests furnish no food except animals. These lowly people  seem to have been so occupied with the severe struggle with the elements  that they could not even advance out of savagery into barbarism. They  were homeless nomads whose movements were determined largely by the food  supply.    Among the Athapascans who occupied all the western part of the northern  pine forests, clothing was made of deerskins with the hair left on. The  lodges were "]]]
