It is one reminiscent of heroism, faith, hope, and charity.    Now, during all this gun and rifle firing not a reply was sent.  The  Staff allowed the Turks to expend their shells and bullets.  That is  always good business in war.  It adds to the enemy's problem of supply.  This bombardment lasted for two hours.  No doubt the Turks were well  pleased.  But immediately they ceased their fire there was a universal  Boom! from the Australian lines.  Battleships, cruisers, torpedo boats,  howitzer batteries, field batteries, and Maxim guns sent back salvo  after salvo of a deafening and devilish kind.    The unerring aim of our gunners paralysed, for a time, the initiative  of the Turkish Staff.  This tremendous reply was unexpected.  And the  British shells burst in their magazines, their supply depots, their  headquarters dug-outs in a startling way.  Never was gunnery so deadly.  Never was slaughter so sure.  Regiments waiting _en masse_ for the  assault were torn and butchered.  Trenches were burst and destroyed.  It was death, desolation, and disaster of an unexpected and amazing  kind.  Such is the value of information in war.  A good Intelligence  Officer is equal to a complete division of all arms.    Yet this bombardment did not deter the Turkish assault.  It had been  arranged; it had to go on.  When the British bombardment ceased, they  leaped boldly from their trenches and came on _en masse_.  A strange  silence now pervaded the Australasian lines.  Not a shot was heard.  It  was the calm before the storm.  They allowed the Turks to advance.  On  they came, great, dark, strong-looking men.  They shouted \"Allah!\"  \"Allah!\" as they ran.  This cry for \"Allah\" was a bad sign.  The Turks  expected \"Allah\" to do what they felt they had not the confidence to do  themselves.  Still, the German task-masters had given them a certain  assurance by sending them forward elbow to elbow, line upon line.    In brief, this attack was meant as an overwhelming flood of bayonets  upon the Australasians' lines.  The Turkish Staff argued that, after  all, these troops were only volunteers; they could not withstand a  violent offensive movement.  But they did; they even surprised their  General and the Staff.  And the ability to wait for a signal to shoot  was in itself a sign of perfect control, excellent fire discipline.    The Turks were now close to the barbed wire entanglements.  This was  the moment desired.  A whistle sounded in the lines.    Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Z-r-r-p! went thousands of rifles and dozens of  machine-guns.  Gad!  How these Turks withered and fell.  It was brutal,  yet it was inspiring.  Shrieks, curses, and groans were mixed with  pitiful cries for \"Allah!\" \"Allah!\"    Bravely these Turkish soldiers died, and bravely the more fortunate  came on.  They tore through the barbed wire with a fiendish frenzy and  leaped down on to parts of their enemy's lines.  With that mad ferocity  which only a Moslem fanatic can display, they plugged their bayonets  into the first opposing man.  Cold steel is hard to face.  Few armies  can face it.  Only Russians, Britishers, and Japs are good at the game.  And these sons of John Bull stood up to the test with a magnificent  courage.  They plunged, thrust, hacked, butted, cursed, and fumed in  this awful combat.  Civilisation had gone.  Primitive lusts were  triumphant.  Blood flowed in streams, men fought with gaping wounds,  dying men fell crying to Allah or to God according to their race and  creed.  There was no time to moralise on the hellish side of modern  war.  There was only time to fight or die.    And in this awful combat The Kangaroos had a terrible time.  Their  redoubt was invaded.  Yet they did not yield.  One great Turk charged  down on Claud.  Sandy parried the thrust, the Turk recovered and thrust  again straight into poor Sandy's heart.  He gasped, and fell lifeless  at Bill's feet.    With maddened fury Bill crashed his butt down on the foeman's skull.    Another Turk almost pinned Colonel Killem, but Paddy dashed forward,  struck up the bayonet, and killed the man with a blow.    \"Thanks, Doolan, thanks!\" shouted the Colonel as he turned to deal with  another man.  This gallant defence, combined with the deadly musketry  on the less exposed parts of the line, completely smashed the first  Turkish attack.  The enemy withered away, their survivors and wounded  creeping back into the shelter of their trenches.    \"Don't fire, men!  Don't fire at those poor devils,\" shouted the  officers as they watched them limp away.    This was chivalry, and chivalry can always be found in a British heart.    \"Thank God for a breath,\" said Claud, leaning wearily against the  parapet.  But the attack was not finished.  The Turkish reserves were  swarming up the gullies and through the communicating lines.  Lyddite,  shrapnel, and Maxims tore great gaps in their ranks.  Yet on they came.  One regiment deployed from the top of a gully and made the charge.    \"Rapid fire!\" roared Killem.   A terrific fusillade burst forth.  The  Turks fell in heaps, moaning, shrieking, and yelling.  The sight was  sickening.  Heaps of dead and dying all around.  But _again_ the  Turkish host came on.  Two great columns of men burst out in front of  the New Zealanders and The Kangaroos.    This was really the most critical moment of the day.  Here entered the  Drill Book maxim: \"An attack should be met with a counter-attack.\"  For  this was to be the last and desperate throw of the Turkish Staff.  If  it broke the Australasian lines, the enemy would realise their boast of  pushing them into the sea.  The New Zealanders and Kangaroos  appreciated the danger to the full.  And so the command rang out:  \"Prepare to charge!\"  Every man placed his foot for the jump.    \"Charge!\"    Up leaped Killem and his willing men, and at their side charged the New  Zealand boys.  Grimly they gripped their rifles, bravely they ran and  cheered.  A charge is a thrilling and soul-inspiring affair.  Danger  and death pass away from the soldier's heart.  He is alive, he is  filled with the tingling blood and full of the traditions of his race.  The Kangaroos met the Turkish host midway.  A shock of men, a shock of  arms, a blind confusion, a horrible fierceness and hacking of human  flesh.    \"Give it 'em, boys,\" roared Killem above the din.  A Turkish officer  heard him and aimed his revolver at Killem's head.  But Doolan was  there again.  He pinned his man through the chest, and, with an oath,  flung him off his bayonet--dead.    Claud got lost in the _melee_.  He found himself surrounded.  Bravely  he fought, but a bayonet was stuck in his shoulder, and he fell into  the struggling mass of wounded men.  Bill, though wounded in the head,  fought with the madness of a fiend.  With Doolan, he kept close to the  Colonel's heels, preserving the body and life of the bravest man in the  Australasian force.  In that awful hour Killem could often be heard  shouting out, \"Thanks, boys, thanks!\"    At last tenacity and courage told.  The Turks broke and fled, yelling  in pain and fear.  But the price of victory had indeed been costly.  Still, it was worth it all.  The position had been saved.  Australasians had again written deep in the annals of war a story of  valour as great as Corunna or Waterloo.          *      *      *      *      *    \"Paddy,\" shouted Bill as they jumped back into the trenches.    \"Yis.\"    \"Where's Claud?\"    \"He's hit,\" interjected a sergeant.  \"I saw him fall.\"    \"What--dead?\"    \"Couldn't say.\"  And the sergeant passed on.  War does not allow of  sentiment or lengthy harangues.    \"Curse them!\" said Bill, throwing down his rifle in anger.  And then  this great, strong man collapsed with grief.  When a soldier weeps it  is sad.  This was but the climax of a highly nervous day.  Bill's  heart, like every bushman's heart, was full of that faith and devotion  which passes all understanding.  Claud was a pal whom he loved like a  mother or a brother.    \"D---- their bullets!  I'm going back to get him,\" he muttered,  preparing to jump out again.    \"Paddy Doolan's wid you,\" said the Irishman.  They both jumped out into  the still bullet-swept zone.    \"Come back, you fools,\" roared a sergeant.    There was no answer.  Bill would not allow discipline or danger to  interfere with the call of duty or friendship.  On their hands and  knees they crawled round the heaps of dead and dying.    \"Here he is--here he is, poor boy!  Poor boy!\" said Paddy as he gazed  at the pale, bloodless face of Claud below some battered Turks.    \"He's livin', he's livin'.  God be thanked!\" mumbled the faithful  Irishman as he crossed himself.  Bending near, he pulled the listless  form from under the dead weight of the men above.  Claud groaned.    \"That's a good sign, Paddy, eh?\"    \"Sure, an' he'll drink a glass wid us yet!  But, Heavens! what a hole!\"  exclaimed the Irishman, looking at the gaping wound in Claud's shoulder.    \"Get his dressing out,\" said Bill.    Paddy made to rip the dressing out of Claud's jacket.  Alas! man  proposes and the Turk disposes.  A sniper's rifle pinged, and a bullet  hit Paddy in the arm.  It fell, shattered and useless.    \"Back, Paddy--into the trenches for your life.  I'll carry Claud.\"    The brave Irishman, realising he was now useless, reluctantly obeyed.  Bill then heaved Claud over his shoulder and followed hard.    Bang!  Bang! Bang! went the Turkish rifles.  Claud was hit in the hand,  and poor Bill struck in the leg and back; then he fell exhausted into  the trench, the wounded Claud on top.    \"Bravo!  Buster--you're a white man, anyway,\" said the Colonel.    \"A done man, Colonel,\" said Bill with a wan smile as he fainted away.  His wounds and Claud's wounds were bound with the Colonel's own hand.  Then commenced the weary procession through trench after trench to the  hospital below.  They were but two "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#16)"],[1,"Frenchy. \"Up in Buffalo, Smith, who's  now marshal, makes yu leave 'em with th' bartenders.\"    \"I'd like to see any two-laigged cuss get my guns If I didn't want him  to!\" began Hopalong, indignant at the idea.    \"Easy, son,\" cautioned Buck. \"Yu would do what th' rest did because yu  are a square man. I'm about as hard-headed a puncher as ever straddled  leather an' I've had to use my guns purty considerable, but I reckons if  any decent marshal asked me to cache them in a decent way, why, I'd  do it. An' let me brand somethin' on yore mind--I've heard of Smith of  Buffalo, an' he's mighty nifty with his hands. He don't stand off an'  tell yu to unload yore lead-ranch, but he ambles up close an' taps yu  on yore shirt; if yu makes a gunplay he naturally knocks yu clean across  th' room an' unloads yu afore yu gets yore senses back.

Just because I totes  them in plain sight I've got to hand 'em over to some liquor-wrastler? I  reckons not! Some hip-pocket skunk would plug me afore I could wink. I'd  shore look nice loping around a keno layout without my guns, in th'  same town with some cuss huntin' me, wouldn't I? A whole lot of good a  marshal would a done Jimmy, an' didn't Harris get his from a cur in th'  dark?\" shouted Hopalong, angered by the prospect.    \"We're talkin' about Buffalo, where everybody has to hang up their  guns,\" replied Buck. \"An' there's th' law--\"    \"To blazes with th' law!\" whooped Hopalong in Red's ear as he  unfastened the cinch of Red's saddle and at the same time stabbing that  unfortunate's mount with his spurs, thereby causing a hasty separation  of the two. When Red had picked himself up and things had quieted down  again the subject was changed, and several hours later they rode into  Muddy Wells, a town with a little more excuse for its existence than  Buckskin. The wells were in an arid valley west of Guadaloupe Pass, and  were not only muddy but more or less alkaline.        CHAPTER. X. Peace Hath its Victories      As they neared the central group of buildings they heard a hilarious  and assertive song which sprang from the door and windows of the main  saloon. It was in jig time, rollicking and boisterous, but the words had  evidently been improvised for the occasion, as they clashed immediately  with those which sprang to the minds of the outfit, although they could  not be clearly distinguished. As they approached nearer and finally  dismounted, however, the words became recognizable and the visitors were  at once placed in harmony with the air of jovial recklessness by the  roaring of the verses and the stamping of the time.         Oh we're red-hot cow-punchers playin' on our luck,       An' there ain't a proposition that we won't buck:       From sunrise to sunset we've ridden on the range,       But now we're oft for a howlin' change.    CHORUS         Laugh a little, sing a little, all th' day;       Play a little, drink a little--we can pay;       Ride a little, dig a little an' rich we'll grow.       Oh, we're that bunch from th' O-Bar-O!         Oh, there was a little tenderfoot an' he had a little gun,       An' th' gun an' him went a-trailin' up some fun.       They ambles up to Santa Fe' to find a quiet game,       An' now they're planted with some more of th' same!    As Hopalong, followed by the others, pushed open the door and entered  he took up the chorus with all the power of Texan lungs and even Billy  joined in. The sight that met their eyes was typical of the men and the  mood and the place. Leaning along the walls, lounging on the table and  straddling chairs with their forearms crossed on the backs were nine  cowboys, ranging from old twenty to young fifty in years, and all were  shouting the song and keeping time with their hands and feet.    In the center of the room was a large man dancing a fair buck-and-wing  to the time so uproariously set by his companions. Hatless,  neck-kerchief loose, holsters flapping, chaps rippling out and close,  spurs clinking and perspiration streaming from his tanned face, danced  Bigfoot Baker as though his life depended on speed and noise. Bottles  shook and the air was fogged with smoke and dust. Suddenly, his belt  slipping and letting his chaps fall around his ankles, he tripped and  sat down heavily. Gasping for breath, he held out his hand and received  a huge plug of tobacco, for Bigfoot had won a contest.    Shouts of greeting were hurled at the newcomers and many questions were  fired at them regarding \"th' latest from th' Hills.\" Waffles made a rush  for Hopalong, but fell over Big-foot's feet and all three were piled up  in a heap. All were beaming with good nature, for they were as so many  school boys playing truant. Prosaic cow-punching was relegated to the  rear and they looked eagerly forward to their several missions. Frenchy  told of the barb-wire fence war and of the new regulations of \"Smith  of Buffalo\" regarding cow-punchers' guns, and from the caustic remarks  explosively given it was plain to be seen what a wire fence could  expect, should one be met with, and there were many imaginary Smiths put  hors de combat.    Kid Morris, after vainly trying to slip a blue-bottle fly inside of  Hopalong's shirt, gave it up and slammed his hand on Hopalong's back  instead, crying: \"Well, I'll be doggoned if here ain't Hopalong! How's  th' missus an' th' deacon an' all th' folks to hum? I hears yu an'  Frenchy's reg'lar poker fiends!\"    \"Oh, we plays onct in a while, but we don't want none of yore dust.  Yu'll shore need it all afore th' Hills get through with yu,\" laughingly  replied Hopalong.    \"Oh, yore shore kind! But I was a sort of reckonin' that we needs some  more. Perfesser P. D. Q. Waffles is our poker man an' he shore can clean  out anything I ever saw. Mebbe yu fellers feel reckless-like an' would  like to make a pool,\" he cried, addressing the outfit of the Bar-20,  \"an' back yore boss of th' full house agin ourn?\"    Red turned slowly around and took a full minute in which to size the Kid  up. Then he snorted and turned his back again.    The Kid stared at him in outraged dignity. \"Well, what say!\" he softly  murmured. Then he leaped forward and walloped Red on the back.  \"Hey, yore royal highness!\" he shouted. \"Yu-yu-yu-oh, hang it-yu! Yu  slab-sided, ring-boned, saddle-galled shade of a coyote, do yu think I'm  only meanderin' in th' misty vales of-of--\"    Suggestions intruded from various sources. \"Hades?\" offered Hopalong.  \"Cheyenne?\" Murmured Johnny. \"Misty mistiness of misty?\" tentatively  supplied Waffles.    Red turned around again. \"Better come up an' have somethin',\" he  sympathetically invited, wiping away an imaginary tear.    \"An' he's so young!\" sobbed Frenchy.    \"An' so fair!\" wailed Tex.    \"An' so ornery!\" howled Lefty, throwing his arms around the discomfited  youngster. Other arms went around him, and out of the sobbing mob could  be heard earnest and heart-felt cussing, interspersed with imperative  commands, which were gradually obeyed.    The Kid straightened up his wearing apparel. \"Come on, yu locoed--\"    \"Angels?\" Queried Charley Lane, interrupting him. \"Sweet things?\"  breathed Hopalong in hopeful expectancy.    \"Oh, blast it!\" yelled the Kid as he ran out into the street to escape  the persecution.    \"Good Kid, all right,\" remarked Waffles. \"He'll go around an' lick some  Mexican an' come back sweet as honey.\"    \"Did somebody say poker?\" Asked Bigfoot, digressing from the Kid.    \"Oh, yu fellows don't want no poker. Of course yu don't. Poker's mighty  uncertain,\" replied Red.    \"Yah!\" exclaimed Tex Le Blanc, pushing forward. \"I'll just bet yu to  a standstill that Waffles an' Salvation'll round up all th' festive  simoleons yu can get together! An' I'll throw in Frenchy's hat as an  inducement.\"    \"Well, if yore shore set on it make her a pool,\" replied Red, \"an' th'  winners divide with their outfit. Here's a starter,\" he added, tossing a  buckskin bag on the table. \"Come on, pile 'em up.\"    The crowd divided as the players seated themselves at the table, the  O-Bar-O crowd grouping themselves behind their representatives; the  Bar-20 behind theirs. A deck of cards was brought and the game was on.    Red, true to his nature, leaned back in a corner, where, hands on hips,  he awaited any hostile demonstration on the part of the O-Bar-O; then,  suddenly remembering, he looked half ashamed of his warlike position and  became a peaceful citizen again. Buck leaned with his broad back against  the bar, talking over his shoulder to the bartender, but watching  Tenspot Davis, who was assiduously engaged in juggling a handful of  Mexican dollars.    Up by the door Bigfoot Baker, elated at winning the buck-and-wing  contest, was endeavoring to learn a new step, while his late rival was  drowning his defeat at Buck's elbow. Lefty Allen was softly singing a  Mexican love song, humming when the words would not come. At the  table could be heard low-spoken card terms and good-natured banter,  interspersed with the clink of gold and silver and the soft pat-pat  of the onlookers' feet unconsciously keeping time to Lefty's song.  Notwithstanding the grim assertiveness of belts full of .45's and the  peeping handles of long-barreled Colts, set off with picturesque chaps,  sombreros and tinkling spurs, the scene was one of peaceful content and  good-fellowship.    \"Ugh!\" grunted Johnny, walking over to Red and informing that person  that he, Red, was a worm-eaten prune and that for half a wink he,  Johnny, would prove it. Red grabbed him by the seat of his corduroys  and the collar of his shirt and helped him outside, where they strolled  about, taking pot shots at whatever their fancy suggested.    Down the street in a cloud of dust rumbled the Las Cruces-El Paso stage "]]]
