When mature, these spores fall freely upon  the ground beneath, imparting to it the general colour of the spores.  But it must be observed that the hymenium takes the form of  gill-plates in only one order of _Hymenomycetes_, namely, the  _Agaricini_; and here, as in _Cantharellus_, the hymenium is sometimes  spread over prominent veins rather than gills. Still further  divergence is manifest in the _Polyporei_, in which order the hymenium  lines the inner surface of pores or tubes, which are normally on the  under side of the pileus. Both these orders include an immense number  of species, the former more or less fleshy, the latter more or less  tough and leathery. There are still other forms and orders in this  family, as the _Hydnei_, in which the hymenium clothes the surface of  prickles or spines, and the _Auricularini_, in which the hymenium is  entirely or almost even. In the two remaining orders, there is a  still further divergence from the mushroom form. In the one called  _Clavariei_, the entire fungus is either simply cylindrical or  club-shaped, or it is very much branched and ramified. Whatever form  the fungus assumes, the hymenium covers the whole exposed surface. In  the _Tremellini_, a peculiar structure prevails, which at first seems  to agree but little with the preceding. The whole plant is gelatinous  when fresh, lobed and convolute, often brain-like, and varying in  size, according to species, from that of a pin's head to that of a  man's head. Threads and sporophores are imbedded in the gelatinous  substance,[C] so that the fertile threads are in reality not compacted  into a true hymenium. With this introduction we may state that the  technical characters of the family are thus expressed:--    _Hymenium free, mostly naked, or, if enclosed at first, soon  exposed; spores naked, mostly quaternate, on distinct spicules_ =  HYMENOMYCETES.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--_Agaricus nudus._]    In this family some mycologists believe that fungi attain the highest  form of development of which they are capable, whilst others contend  that the fructification of the _Ascomycetes_ is more perfect, and that  some of the noblest species, such as the pileate forms, are entitled  to the first rank. The morel is a familiar example. Whatever may be  said on this point, it is incontrovertible that the noblest and most  attractive, as well as the largest, forms are classed under the  _Hymenomycetes_.    In _Gasteromycetes_, the second family, a true hymenium is also  present, but instead of being exposed it is for a long time enclosed  in an outer peridium or sac, until the spores are fully matured, or  the fungus is beginning to decay. The common puff-ball (_Lycoperdon_)  is well known, and will illustrate the principal feature of the  family. Externally there is a tough coat or peridium, which is at  first pale, but ultimately becomes brown. Internally is at first a  cream-coloured, then greenish, cellular mass, consisting of the  sinuated hymenium and young spores, which at length, and when the  spores are fully matured become brownish and dusty, the hymenium  being broken up into threads, and the spores become free. In earlier  stages, and before the hymenium is ruptured, the spores have been  found to harmonize with those of _Hymenomycetes_ in their mode of  production, since basidia are present surmounted each by four  spicules, and each spicule normally surmounted by a spore.[D] Here is,  therefore, a cellular hymenium bearing quaternary spores, but,  instead of being exposed, this hymenium is wholly enclosed within  an external sac or peridium, which is not ruptured until the  spores are fully matured, and the hymenium is resolved into  threads, together forming a pulverulent mass. It must, however, be  borne in mind, that in only some of the orders composing this  family is the hymenium thus evanescent, in others being more or less  permanent, and this has led naturally enough to the recognition of  two sub-families, in one of which the hymenium is more or less  permanent, thus following the Hymenomycetous type; and in the  other, the hymenium is evanescent, and the dusty mass of spores tends  more towards the _Coniomycetes_, this being characterized as the  coniospermous (or dusty-spored) sub-family.    The first sub-family includes, first of all, the _Hypogaei_, or  subterranean species. And here again it becomes necessary to remind  the reader that all subterranean fungi are not included in this  order, inasmuch as some, of which the truffle is an example, are  sporidiiferous, developing their sporidia in asci. To these allusion  must hereafter be made. In the _Hypogaei_, the hymenium is permanent and  convoluted, leaving numerous minute irregular cavities, in which the  spores are produced on sporophores. When specimens are very old and  decaying, the interior may become pulverulent or deliquescent. The  structure of subterranean fungi attracted the attention of Messrs.  Tulasne, and led to the production of a splendid monograph on the  subject.[E] Another order belonging to this sub-family is the  _Phalloidei_, in which the volva or peridium is ruptured whilst the  plant is still immature, and the hymenium when mature becomes  deliquescent. Not only are some members of this order most singular in  appearance, but they possess an odour so foetid as to be unapproached in  this property by any other vegetable production.[F] In this order, the  inner stratum of the investing volva is gelatinous. When still young,  and previous to the rupture of the volva, the hymenium presents sinuous  cavities in which the spores are produced on spicules, after the  manner of _Hymenomycetes_.[G] _Nidulariacei_ is a somewhat aberrant  order, presenting a peculiar structure. The peridium consists of two or  three coats, and bursts at the apex, either irregularly or in a  stellate manner, or by the separation of a little lid. Within the  cavity are contained one or more secondary receptacles, which are  either free or attached by elastic threads to the common receptacle.  Ultimately the secondary receptacles are hollow, and spores are  produced in the interior, borne on spicules.[H] The appearance in some  genera as of a little bird's-nest containing eggs has furnished the  name to the order.    The second sub-family contains the coniospermous puff-balls, and  includes two orders, in which the most readily distinguishable  feature is the cellular condition of the entire plant, in its earlier  stages, in the _Trichogastres_, and the gelatinous condition of  the early state of the _Myxogastres_. Both are ultimately resolved  internally into a dusty mass of threads and spores. In the former,  the peridium is either single or double, occasionally borne on a  stem, but usually sessile. In _Geaster_, the \"starry puff-balls,\" the  outer peridium divides into several lobes, which fall back in a  stellate manner, and expose the inner peridium, like a ball in the  centre. In _Polysaccum_, the interior is divided into numerous  cells, filled with secondary peridia. The mode of spore-production  has already been alluded to in our remarks on _Lycoperdon_. All  the species are large, as compared with those of the following  sub-family, and one species of _Lycoperdon_ attains an enormous  size. One specimen recorded in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" was  three feet four inches in circumference, and weighed nearly ten  pounds. In the _Myxogastres_, the early stage has been the subject of  much controversy. The gelatinous condition presents phenomena so  unlike anything previously recorded in plants, that one learned  professor[I] did not hesitate to propose their exclusion from the  vegetable, and recognition in the animal, kingdom as associates of  the Gregarines. When mature, the spores and threads so much resemble  those of the _Trichogastres_, and the little plants themselves are  so veritably miniature puff-balls, that the theory of their animal  nature did not meet with a ready acceptance, and is now virtually  abandoned. The characters of the family we have thus briefly reviewed  are tersely stated, as--    _Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most cases  of closely-packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked spores  on distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the  investing coat or peridium_ = GASTEROMYCETES.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--_Scleroderma vulgare_, Fr.]    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--_Ceuthospora phacidioides_ (Greville).]    We come now to the second section of the _Sporifera_, in which no  definite hymenium is present. And here we find also two families, in  one of which the dusty spores are the prominent feature, and hence  termed _Coniomycetes_; the other, in which the threads are most  noticeable, is _Hyphomycetes_. In the former of these, the reproductive  system seems to preponderate so much over the vegetative, that the  fungus appears to be all spores. The mycelium is often nearly  obsolete, and the short pedicels so evanescent, that a rusty or sooty  powder represents the mature fungus, infesting the green parts of  living plants. This is more especially true of one or two orders. It  will be most convenient to recognize two artificial sub-families for  the purpose of illustration, in one of which the species are developed  on living, and in the other on dead, plants. We will commence with the  latter, recognizing first those which are developed beneath the  cuticle, and then those which are superficial. Of the sub-cuticular,  two orders may be named as the representatives of this group in  Britain, these are the _Sphaeronemei_, in which the spores are contained  in a more or less perfect perithecium, and the _Melanconiei_, in which  there is manifestly none. The first of these is analogous to the  _Sphaeriacei_ of _Ascomycetous_ fungi, and probably consists largely of  spermogonia of known species of _Sphaeria_, the relations of"]]]
