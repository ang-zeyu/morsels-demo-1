History is but scantily  represented; it appears to have been mostly confined to the great wall  inscriptions and some other objects, of which more hereafter. But--what  we should least expect--grammars, dictionaries, school reading-books,  occupy a prominent place. The reason is that, when this library was  founded, the language in which the venerable books of ancient sages were  written not only was not spoken any longer, but had for centuries been  forgotten by all but the priests and those who made scholarship their  chief pursuit, so that it had to be taught in the same way that the  so-called \"dead languages,\" Latin and Greek, are taught at our colleges.  This was the more necessary as the prayers had to be recited in the old  language called the Accadian, that being considered more holy--just as,  in Catholic countries, the common people are even now made to learn and  say their prayers in Latin, though they understand not a word of the  language. The ancient Accadian texts were mostly copied with a modern  Assyrian translation, either interlinear or facing it, which has been of  immense service to those who now decipher the tablets.    [Illustration: 47.--INSCRIBED CLAY TABLET. (Smith's \"Assyria.\")]    13. So much for what may be called the classical and reference  department of the library. Important as it is, it is scarcely more so  than the documentary department or Archive proper, where documents and  deeds of all kinds, both public and private, were deposited for safe  keeping. Here by the side of treatises, royal decrees and despatches,  lists of tribute, reports from generals and governors, also those daily  sent in by the superintendents of the royal observatories,--we find  innumerable private documents: deeds of sale duly signed, witnessed and  sealed, for land, houses, slaves--any kind of property,--of money lent,  of mortgages, with the rate of interest, contracts of all sorts. The  most remarkable of private documents is one which has been called the  \"will of King Sennacherib,\" by which he entrusts some valuable personal  property to the priests of the temple of Nebo, to be kept for his  favorite son,--whether to be delivered after his (the king's) death or  at another time is not stated.    [Illustration: 48.--CLAY TABLET IN ITS CASE. (Hommel.)]    14. It requires some effort to bear in mind the nature and looks of the  things which we must represent to ourselves when we talk of Assyrian  \"_books_.\" The above (Fig. 47) is the portrait of a \"_volume_\" in  perfect condition. But it is seldom indeed that one such is found.  Layard, in his first description of his startling \"find,\" says: \"They  (the tablets) were of different sizes; the largest were flat, and  measured nine inches by six and a half; the smaller were slightly  convex, and some were not more than an inch long, with but one or two  lines of writing. The cuneiform characters on most of them were  singularly sharp and well-defined, but so minute in some instances as to  be illegible without a magnifying glass.\" Most curiously, glass lenses  have been found among the ruins; which may have been used for the  purpose. Specimens have also been found of the very instruments which  were employed to trace the cuneiform characters, and their form  sufficiently accounts for the peculiar shape of these characters which  was imitated by the engravers on stone. It is a little iron rod--(or  _style_, as the ancients used to call such implements)--not sharp, but  _triangular_ at the end: [open triangle]. By slightly pressing this end  on the cake of soft moist clay held in the left hand no other shape of  sign could be obtained than a wedge, [closed triangle], the direction  being determined by a turn of the wrist, presenting the instrument in  different positions. When one side of the tablet was full, the other was  to be filled. If it was small, it was sufficient to turn it over,  continuing to hold the edges between the thumb and third finger of the  left hand. But if the tablet was large and had to be laid on a table to  be written on, the face that was finished would be pressed to the hard  surface, and the clay being soft, the writing would be effaced. This was  guarded against by a contrivance as ingenious as it was simple. Empty  places were left here and there in the lines, in which were stuck small  pegs, like matches. On these the tablet was supported when turned over,  and also while baking in the oven. On many of the tablets that have  been preserved are to be seen little holes or dints, where the pegs have  been stuck. Still, it should be mentioned that these holes are not  confined to the large tablets and not found on all large tablets. When  the tablet was full, it was allowed to dry, then generally, but not  always, baked. Within the last few years several thousands unbaked  tablets have been found in Babylonia; they crumbled into dust under the  finders' fingers. It was then proposed to bake such of them as could at  all bear handling. The experiment was successful, and numbers of  valuable documents were thus preserved and transported to the great  repository of the British Museum. The tablets are covered with writing  on both sides and most accurately classed and numbered, when they form  part of a series, in which case they are all of the same shape and size.  The poem discovered by George Smith is written out on twelve tablets,  each of which is a separate book or chapter of the whole. There is an  astronomical work in over seventy tablets. The first of them begins with  the words: \"_When the gods Anu and ..._\" These words are taken as the  title of the entire series. Each tablet bears the notice: First, second,  third tablet of \"_When the gods Anu and ..._\" To guard against all  chance of confusion, the last line of one tablet is repeated as the  first line of the following one--a fashion which we still see in old  books, where the last word or two at the bottom of a page is repeated at  the top of the next.    [Illustration: 49.--ANTIQUE BRONZE SETTING OF CYLINDER. (Perrot and  Chipiez.)]    [Illustration: 50.--CHALDEAN CYLINDER AND IMPRESSION.(Perrot and Chipiez.)]    [Illustration: 51.--ASSYRIAN CYLINDER. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    15. The clay tablets of the ancient Chaldeans are distinguished from the  Assyrian ones by a curious peculiarity: they are sometimes enclosed in a  case of the same material, with exactly the same inscription and seals  as on the inner tablet, even more carefully executed.[U] It is evidently  a sort of duplicate document, made in the prevision that the outer one  might be injured, when the inner record would remain. Rows of figures  across the tablet are impressed on it with seals called from their shape  cylinders, which were rolled over the soft moist clay. These cylinders  were generally of some valuable, hard stone--jasper, amethyst,  cornelian, onyx, agate, etc.,--and were used as signet rings were later  and are still. They are found in great numbers, being from their  hardness well-nigh indestructible. They were generally bored through,  and through the hole was passed either a string to wear them on, or a  metal axis, to roll them more easily.[V] There is a large and most  valuable collection of seal cylinders at the British Museum. Their size  ranges from a quarter of an inch to two inches or a little more. But  cylinders were also made of baked clay and larger size, and then served  a different purpose, that of historical documents. These are found in  the foundations of palaces and temples, mostly in the four corners, in  small niches or chambers, generally produced by leaving out one or more  bricks. These tiny monuments range from a couple of inches to half a  foot in height, seldom more; they are sometimes shaped like a prism with  several faces (mostly six), sometimes like a barrel, and covered with  that compact and minute writing which it often requires a magnifying  glass to make out. Owing to their sheltered position, these singular  records are generally very well preserved. Although their original  destination is only to tell by whom and for what purpose the building  has been erected, they frequently proceed to give a full though  condensed account of the respective kings' reigns, so that, should the  upper structure with its engraved annals be destroyed by the  vicissitudes of war or in the course of natural decay, some memorial of  their deeds should still be preserved--a prevision which, in several  cases, has been literally fulfilled. Sometimes the manner and material  of these records were still more fanciful. At Khorsabad, at the very  interior part of the construction, was found a large stone chest, which  enclosed several inscribed plates in various materials. \"... In this only  extant specimen of an Assyrian foundation stone were found one little  golden tablet, one of silver, others of copper, lead and tin; a sixth  text was engraved on alabaster, and the seventh document was written on  the chest itself.\"[W] Unfortunately the heavier portion of this  remarkable find was sent with a collection which foundered on the Tigris  and was lost. Only the small plates,--gold, silver, copper and tin  (antimonium scholars now think it to be)--survived, and the inscriptions  on them have been read and translated. They all commemorate, in very  nearly the same terms, the foundation and erection of a new city and  palace by a very famous king and conqueror, generally (though not  correctly) called Sargon, and three of them end with a request to the  kings his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#16)"],[1,"was in him  was so abounding and exultant that it broke all dikes and dams; and  laughter for him needed no justification, it was a part of this  abounding life. After the mediaeval asceticism and the intellectual  bondage of scholasticism, life in Rabelais has its vast outbreak and  explosion; he would be no fragment of humanity, but a complete man.  He would enjoy the world to the full, and yet at the same time there  is something of stoicism in his philosophy of life; while gaily  accepting the good things of the earth, he would hold himself detached  from the gifts of fortune, and possess his soul in a strenuous sanity.  Let us return--such is his teaching--to nature, honouring the body,  but giving higher honour to the intellect and to the moral feeling;  let us take life seriously, and therefore gaily; let us face death  cheerfully, knowing that we do not wholly die; with light in the  understanding and love in the heart, we can confront all dangers and  defy all doubts.    He is the creator of characters which are types. His  giants--Grandgousier, Gargantua, Pantagruel--are giants of good  sense and large benevolence. The education of Pantagruel presents  the ideal pedagogy of the Renaissance, an education of the whole  man--mind and body--in contrast with the dwarfing subtleties and  word-spinning of the effete mediaeval schools. Friar John is the monk  whose passion for a life of activity cannot be restrained; his  violence is the overflow of wholesome energy. It is to his care that  the Abbey of Thelema is confided, where young men and maidens are  to be occupied with every noble toil and every high delight, an abbey  whose rule has but a single clause (since goodness has no rule save  freedom), \"Do what you will.\" Of such a fraternity, love and marriage  are the happiest outcome. Panurge, for whom the suggestion was derived  from the macaronic poet Folengo, is the fellow of Shakespeare's  Falstaff, in his lack of morals, his egoism, his inexhaustible wit;  he is the worst and best of company. We would dispense with such a  disreputable associate if we could, but save that he is a \"very wicked  lewd rogue,\" he is \"the most virtuous man in the world,\" and we cannot  part with him. Panurge would marry, but fears lest he may be the victim  of a faithless wife; every mode of divination, every source of  prediction except one is resorted to, and still his fate hangs  threatening; it only remains to consult the oracle of La Dive  Bouteille. The voyaging quest is long and perilous; in each island  at which the adventurers touch, some social or ecclesiastical abuse  is exhibited for ridicule; the word of the oracle is in the end the  mysterious \"Drink\"--drink, that is, if one may venture to interpret  an oracle, of the pure water of wisdom and knowledge, and let the  unknown future rest.    The obscenity and ordure of Rabelais were to the taste of his time;  his severer censures of Church and State were disguised by his  buffoonery; flinging out his good sense and wise counsels with a  liberal hand, he also wields vigorously the dunghill pitchfork. If  he is gross beyond what can be described, he is not, apart from the  evil of such grossness, a corrupter of morals, unless morals be  corrupted by a belief in the goodness of the natural man. The graver  wrongs of his age--wars of ambition, the abuse of public justice,  the hypocrisies, cruelties, and lethargy of the ecclesiastics,  distrust of the intellectual movement, spurious ideals of life--are  vigorously condemned. Rabelais loves goodness, charity, truth; he  pleads for the right of manhood to a full and free development of  all its powers; and if questions of original sin and divine grace  trouble him little, and his creed has some of the hardihood of the  Renaissance, he is full of filial gratitude to _le bon Dieu_ for His  gift of life, and of a world in which to live strongly should be to  live joyously.    The influence of Rabelais is seen in the writers of prose tales who  were his contemporaries and successors; but they want his broad good  sense and real temperance. BONAVENTURE DES PERIERS, whom Marguerite  of Navarre favoured, and whose _Nouvelles Recreations_, with more  of the tradition of the French fabliaux and farces and less of the  Italian manner, have something in common with the stories of the  _Heptameron_, died in desperation by his own hand about 1543. His  Lucianic dialogues which compose the _Cymbalum Mundi_ show the  audacity of scepticism which the new ideas of the Renaissance  engendered in ill-balanced spirits. With all his boldness and ardour  Rabelais exercised a certain discretion, and in revising his own text  clearly exhibited a desire to temper valour with prudence.    It is remarkable that just at the time when Rabelais published the  second and best book of his _Pantagruel_, in which the ideality and  the realism of the Renaissance blossom to the full, there was a certain  revival of the chivalric romance. The Spanish _Amadis des Gaules_  (1540-48), translated by Herberay des Essarts, was a distant echo  of the Romances of the Round Table. The gallant achievements of  courtly knights, their mystical and platonic loves, were a delight  to Francis I., and charmed a whole generation. Thus, for the first  time, the literature of Spain reached France, and the influence of  _Amadis_ reappears in the seventeenth century in the romances of  d'Urfe and Mdlle. de Scudery.    If the genius of the Renaissance is expressed ardently and amply in  the writings of Rabelais, the genius of the Reformation finds its  highest and most characteristic utterance through one whom Rabelais  describes as the \"demoniacle\" of Geneva--JEAN CALVIN (1509-64). The  pale face and attenuated figure of the great Reformer, whose life  was a long disease, yet whose indomitable will sustained him amid  bodily infirmities, present a striking contrast to the sanguine  health and overflowing animal spirits of the good physician who  reckoned laughter among the means of grace. Yet Calvin was not merely  a Reformer: he was also a humanist, who, in his own way, made a profound  study of man, and who applied the learning of a master to the  determination of dogma. His education was partly theological, partly  legal; and in his body of doctrine appear some of the rigour, the  severity, and the formal procedures of the law. Indignation against  the imprisonment and burning of Protestants, under the pretence that  they were rebellious anabaptists, drew him from obscurity; silence,  he thought, was treason. He addressed to the King an eloquent letter,  in which he maintained that the Reformed faith was neither new nor  tending towards schism, and next year (1536) he published his lucid  and logical exposition of Protestant doctrine--the _Christianae  Religionis Institutio_. It placed him, at the age of twenty-seven,  as leader in the forefront of the new religious movement.    But the movement was not merely learned, it was popular, and Calvin  was resolved to present his work to French readers in their own tongue.  His translation--the _Institution_--appeared probably in 1541.  Perhaps no work by an author of seven-and-twenty had ever so great  an influence. It consists of four books--of God, of Jesus as a Mediator,  of the effects of His mediatorial work, and of the exterior forms  of the Church. The generous illusion of Rabelais, that human nature  is essentially good, has no place in Calvin's system. Man is fallen  and condemned under the law; all his righteousness is as filthy rags;  God, of His mere good pleasure, from all eternity predestinated some  men to eternal life and others to eternal death; the Son of God came  to earth to redeem the elect; through the operation of the Holy Spirit  in the gift of faith they are united to Christ, are justified through  His righteousness imputed to them, and are sanctified in their hearts;  the Church is the body of the faithful in every land; the officers  of the Church are chosen by the people; the sacraments are  two--baptism and the Lord's Supper. In his spirit of system, his  clearness, and the logical enchainment of his ideas, Calvin is  eminently French. On the one side he saw the Church of Rome, with--as  he held--its human tradition, its mass of human superstitions,  intervening between the soul and God; on the other side were the  scepticism, the worldliness, the religious indifference of the  Renaissance. Within the Reforming party there was the conflict of  private opinions. Calvin desired to establish once for all, on the  basis of the Scriptures, a coherent system of dogma which should  impose itself upon the minds of men as of divine authority, which  should be at once a barrier against the dangers of superstition and  the dangers of libertine speculation. As the leaders of the French  Revolution propounded political constitutions founded on the idea  of the rights of man, so Calvin aimed at setting forth a creed  proceeding, if we may so put it, from a conception of the absolute  rights of God. Through the mere good pleasure of our Creator, Ruler,  Judge, we are what we are.    It is not perhaps too much to say that Calvin is the greatest writer  of the sixteenth century. He learned much from the prose of Latin  antiquity. Clearness, precision, ordonnance, sobriety, intellectual  energy are compensations for his lack of grace, imagination,  sensibility, and religious unction. He wrote to convince, to impress  his ideas upon other minds, and his austere purpose was attained.  In the days of the pagan Renaissance, it was well for France that  there should also be a Renaissance of moral rigour; if freedom was  needful, so also was discipline. On the other hand, it may be admitted  that Calvin's reason is sometimes the dupe of Calvin's reasoning.    His _Life_ was written in French by his fellow-worker in the  Reformation, Theodore de Beze, who also recorded the history of the  Reformed Churches in"]]]
