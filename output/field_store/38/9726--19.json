Thus the full relationship of this butterfly to other insects may be  shown in the following manner:      _The Brimstone Butterfly._      =ORDER.=--_Lepidoptera_    =Section.=--_Rhopalocera_    FAMILY.--_Pieridae_    _Genus._--_Gonopteryx_    Species.--_Rhamni_    Now, every butterfly has a Latin or Greek name in addition to that by  which it is popularly known. I should have said _two_ Latin or Greek  names. The first of these is always the _generic_ name, and the second  is the one by which we denote the particular member or _species_ of that  genus. Thus, the scientific name of the Brimstone Butterfly is  _Gonopteryx Rhamni_.    'But,' the reader may be inclined to ask, 'why should we not be  satisfied with the one popular name only?' And, 'If we _must_ have a  separate scientific name, could we not find suitable terms among our  English words to build up such a name--one that might express the  principal characteristics of the insect, and also serve all the purposes  of classification?'    Such questions sound very reasonable, and so they are. But the  entomologist's answer is this. We ourselves may get on well without the  help of the dead languages, but we have brother naturalists all over the  world, speaking a great variety of different languages. We endeavour to  help one another--to exchange notes and generally to assist one another  in our labours; and this can be greatly facilitated if we all adopt the  same system of nomenclature. The educated of most of the great nations  generally know something of Latin and Greek, and consequently the  adoption of these languages is generally acceptable to all.    This sounds well, but for my own part I believe that if we are to make  any branch of natural history a popular study, especially with the  young, we must to a certain extent avoid anything that may prove  distasteful. There is no doubt whatever that many a youngster has been  turned away from the pursuit of the study of nature by the formidable  array of almost unpronounceable names that stretch nearly halfway across  a page; and those who desire to make such a study pleasant to beginners  should be very cautious with the use of these necessary evils. One would  think, on glancing over some of the scientific manuals that are written  'especially for the young,' that the authors considered our own too mean  a language for so exalted a purpose, for in such works we find all or  nearly all the popular names by which the schoolboy knows certain  creatures he has seen entirely omitted, and the description of a species  appended to a long Latin term that conveys no idea whatever to the  reader, who is studying the description of a well-known animal or plant  and doesn't know it.    Our plan will be to give the popular names throughout, except in the  case of those few species that are not so well known as to have  received one; but the scientific names will always be given as well for  the benefit of those readers who would like to know them. And the short  description of the method of classification just given will enable the  more ambitious of my readers to thoroughly understand the table of  British butterflies and moths toward the end of the book.    This table includes _all_ the British species of butterflies and of the  larger moths; and the arrangement is such as to show clearly the  divisions into sections, families, &c. It will therefore be of great  value for reference, and as a guide for the arrangement of the specimens  in the cabinet.    In the foregoing description of the method of classification butterflies  only are mentioned; but the division and arrangement of moths is carried  out in just the same manner except that the system is a little more  complicated. The number of moths is so large in comparison, that we are  able to select from them some very large groups the species of which  possess features in common. These groups are termed _tribes_, and are  again divided into families just like the butterflies. Thus the  arrangement of moths includes _tribes_, _families_, _genera_ and  _species_. We will take an example by way of illustration as we did  before, and ask the reader to verify the same by comparison with our  table:      _Example._--The 'Common Tiger' (Plate X, fig. 3).      =ORDER.=--_Lepidoptera_    =Section.=--_Heterocera_    TRIBE.--_Bombyces_    FAMILY.--_Cheloniidae_    _Genus._--_Arctia_    Species.--_Caia_    Scientific Name.--_Arctia Caia._    I have already said that the Latin and Greek names of butterflies and  moths are not at all necessary to the young entomologist. It is quite  possible to be well acquainted with the natural history of these  creatures, and to derive all the pleasure and benefits that the study of  them can afford without the knowledge of such names; but most  entomologists go in for them, often to the entire exclusion of the  popular English terms.    There are those who consider themselves (or would have us consider them)  expert entomologists because they have the power to vomit forth a long  list of scientific names of butterflies and moths which (to them) have  no meaning whatever; and it is astonishing that we meet with so many  youngsters who can rattle away such terms, and, at the same time, are  totally ignorant of the real nature of the creatures they name.    If you wish to be a naturalist in the true sense of the term, study your  _specimens_, and take but little pains to commit their hard names to  memory; and you will then find that the latter will gradually become  your own property without any special effort on your part. Your  continued reference to illustrated works and museum collections will  bring them to you almost unconsciously, and you will generally find your  entomological vocabulary extending as rapidly as your cabinet becomes  filled.    Again, with regard to the _meanings_ of the scientific terms, don't  trouble much about them. It unfortunately happens that in a very large  number of cases these names are ill chosen, and do not in any way refer  to the distinguishing characteristics of the species to which they are  applied. You will observe, too, if you look at the table, that many  insects have _two_ scientific names applied to the species, one being  placed in brackets after the other. In such cases both these names are  in common use, having both been applied by independent authorities, and  the insertion of the two will prove an assistance at times.    It is a common practice with entomologists, in their communications, to  use only the second or _specific_ name of insects. Thus, they would  speak of the Brimstone Butterfly as _Rhamni_, and not _Gonopteryx  Rhamni_. When _writing_ a communication, however, they very commonly  place in front of the specific name the initial letter of the first or  _generic_ name. Thus the full title of the butterfly just mentioned  would be abbreviated to _G. Rhamni_.    Having said so much concerning the principles of classification and  nomenclature, we will pass on to the practical portion of the  entomologist's work.          PART II    WORK AT HOME AND IN THE FIELD          CHAPTER VI    _CATCHING BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS_      It is not at all surprising that entomology should prove such a  fascinating study to the young, and more especially that portion which  deals with the department we are now considering. Butterflies and moths  are among the most beautiful and most interesting of living creatures.  The study of their life history is enchanting, and the creatures  themselves are of such a size as to be conveniently handled and  preserved, and withal occupy so little space that anyone with only  moderate accommodation may possess a fairly typical collection.    Compare the work of the entomologist with that of one whose hobby is the  study of mammals. The latter has to deal with large and cumbersome  objects, a collection of which requires an enormous amount of space;  and, unless he has the time and means to travel in foreign countries, he  cannot get together a good typical collection of specimens representing  his particular branch, for the few British mammals contain no  representatives of several of the orders into which the class is  divided.    Entomology is undoubtedly, _par excellence_, _the_ study for youngsters.  It is equally suited to the studious and to those of an adventurous turn  of mind. It leads its follower into the bright sunshine and the flowery  meadows; and with body and mind pleasantly occupied, the joy of living  is deeply felt. The necessary apparatus can be made by anyone. No  dangerous gun is required, and there are no precipitous rocks to scale.  When the autumn flowers fade the year's work of the entomologist is not  done, for the arranging of his cabinet and the demands of his living  specimens keep him more or less actively engaged until the flowers of  the following spring call both him and the insects he loves once more  into the field. And so, season after season, and year after year, he  finds himself engrossed in labours so fascinating that idleness--the  curse of so many of our youths--is with him an impossibility.    I assume that the readers of this book have a desire to take up the  study of one branch of entomology--that of butterflies and moths--in  real earnest; that they intend not only to _read_ about these  interesting insects, but to _know_ them. And there is only one way in  which one may really get to know living creatures; that is by searching  them out in their haunts, observing their growth and habits, and by an  occasional close examination in order to become acquainted with their  structure.    Hence I shall in this, the practical portion of the work, give such  information as will assist the beginner in catching, preserving,  rearing, breeding, and arranging the specimens that are to form his  collection.      _Catching"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#16)"],[1,"ease. But in this case,  the heating of the cream has already disposed the oily matter to cohere,  an incipient running together of the globules has probably taken place  before the cream is removed from the milk, and hence the comparative  ease with which the churning is effected. There is something peculiar in  butter prepared in this way, as it is known in other countries by the  name of Bohemian butter. It is said to be very agreeable in flavor, but  it must contain more cheesy matter than the butter from ordinary cream.      Churning the whole Milk    Is a much more laborious method, from the difficulty of keeping in  motion such large quantities of fluid. It has the advantage, however, of  giving a larger quantity of butter. At Rennes, in Brittany, the milk of  the previous evening is poured _into the churn_ along with the warm  morning's milk, and the mixture is allowed to stand for some hours, when  the whole is churned. In this way it is said that a larger quantity of  butter is obtained, and of a more delicate flavor.    In the neighborhood of Glasgow, according to Mr. Aiton, the milk is  allowed to stand six, twelve, or twenty-four hours in the dairy, till  the whole has cooled, and the cream has risen to the surface. Two or  three milkings, still sweet, are then poured together with their cream,  into a large vessel, and are left undisturbed till the whole has become  quite sour, and is completely coagulated. The proper sourness is  indicated by the formation of a stiff _brat_ upon the surface _which has  become uneven_. Great care must be taken to keep the brat and curd  unbroken until the milk is about to be churned, for if any of the whey  be separated, the air gains admission to it and to the curd, and  fermentation is induced. By this fermentation, the quality of the butter  may or may not be affected, but that of the buttermilk is almost sure to  be injured.    In Holland the practice is a little different. The cream is not allowed  to rise to the surface at all, but the milk is stirred two or three  times a day, till it gets sour, and so thick that a wooden spoon will  stand in it. It is then put into the churn, and the working, or the  separation of the butter is assisted by the addition of a quantity of  cold water. By churning the sour milk in one or other of these ways, the  butter is said to be \"rich, sound, and well-flavored.\" If it be greater  in quantity, it is, according to Sprengel, because the fatty matter  carries with it from the milk a larger quantity of casein than it does  in most cases from the cream alone.      Sourness of the Cream.    For the production of the best butter, it is necessary that the cream  should be sufficiently sour before it is put into the churn. Butter made  from sweet cream (not clouted) is neither good in quality, nor large in  quantity, and longer time is required in churning. It is an unprofitable  method.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    Fig. 18 is a _Cylindrical Thermometer Churn_, of any required size, with  false metal bottom to hold cold or hot water for bringing the cream to  the proper temperature. A thermometer, permanently set in the side,  indicates the heat.      Quickness in Churning.    The more quickly milk or cream is churned, the paler, the softer, and  the less rich the butter. Cream, according to Mr. Aiton, may be safely  churned in an hour and a half, while milk ought to obtain from two to  three hours. The churning ought always to be regular, slower in warm  weather, that the butter may not be soft and white, and quicker in  winter, that the proper temperature may be kept up.    A barrel-churn, lately introduced into this country, being placed in a  trough of water of the proper temperature, readily imparts the degree of  heat required by the milk or cream without the necessity of adding warm  water to the milk, _and churns the whole in ten or twelve minutes_. It  is said also to give a larger weight of butter from the same quantity of  milk. If the quality be really as good by this quick churning, the  alleged inferiority in the quality of butter churned quickly in the  common churn cannot be due to the mere rapidity of churning alone.      Over-churning.    When the process of churning is continued after the full separation of  the butter, it loses its fine yellowish, waxy appearance, and becomes  soft and light-colored. The weight of the butter, however, is  considerably increased; and hence, in Lancashire, over-churning is  frequently practised in the manufacture of fresh butter for immediate  sale.      Temperature of the Milk or Cream.    Much also depends upon the temperature of the milk or cream when the  churning is commenced. Cream when put into the churn should never be  warmer than 55 deg. Fahrenheit It rises during the churning from 4 deg. to 10 deg.  F. above its original temperature. When the whole milk is churned, the  temperature should be raised to 65 deg. F., which is best done by pouring in  hot water into the churn _while the milk is kept in motion_. In winter,  either of these temperatures may be easily attained. In cold weather it  is often necessary to add hot water to the cream to raise it even to  55 deg.. But in summer, and especially in hot weather, it is difficult, even  in cool and well-ordered dairies, (without the use of ice,) to keep the  cream down to this comparatively low temperature. Hence, if the cream be  then churned, a second-rate butter, at best, is all that can be  obtained.      The alleged advantages of Churning the entire Milk.    The proper temperature can be readily obtained both in winter and  summer. A hundred gallons of entire milk, will give, in summer, five per  cent. more butter than the cream from the same quantity of milk. Butter  of the best quality can be obtained without difficulty, both in winter  and summer. No special attention to circumstances, or change of method,  is at any time required. The churning in winter and summer is alike  simple and easy. The butter is not only of the best quality while fresh,  but is also best for long-keeping, when properly cured or salted.      Cleanliness in all the operations of the Dairy.    This is peculiarly necessary to the manufacture of good butter. Cream is  remarkable for the rapidity with which it absorbs and becomes tainted by  any unpleasant odors. It is very necessary that the air of the dairy  should be sweet, that it should be often renewed, and that it should be  open in no direction from which bad odors can come. (_Johnston and other  authorities._)    The statement of J. T. Lansing, who received the first premium for  butter from the New York State Agricultural Society, is as follows:--    _Keep the cows stabled through the inclement season_; feed them from  three to four times per day with good hay or green stalks; when near  coming in, add some oats, barley, or corn cracked. In summer, good  pasture, with living water accessible at all times, and plenty of salt.    _Treatment of milk and cream before churning._--Strain the milk in tin  pans; place them in a cool cellar for the cream to rise. When  sufficiently risen, separate the cream from the milk; put in stone jars,  well prepared before churning.    _The mode of churning in summer._--Rinse the churn with cold water; then  turn in the cream, and add to each jar of cream put in the churn, full  one-fourth of the same quantity of cold water. The churn used is a  patent one, moved by hand with a crank, having paddles attached, and so  constructed as to warm the milk (if too cold) with hot water, without  mixing them together. The milk and cream receive the same treatment in  winter as in summer; and in churning, use hot instead of cold water, if  necessary.    _The method of freeing the butter from the milk_, is to wash the butter  with cold water, till it shows no color of the milk, by the use of a  ladle.    _Salting the butter._--Use the best kind of Liverpool sack-salt; the  quantity varies according to the state in which the butter is taken from  the churn; if soft, more; if hard, less; always taking the taste for  the surest guide. Add no saltpetre, nor other substances.    _The best time for churning_ is the morning, in hot weather, and to keep  the butter cool till put down.    _The best mode of preserving butter_, in and through the summer and  winter, is as follows:--The vessel is a stone jar, clean and sweet. The  mode of putting it down is to put in a churning of butter, and put on  strong brine; let it remain on until the next churning is ready to put  down, and so on till the jar is filled; then cover it with fine salt the  same to remain on till used.    Mr. McWilliams, of Orange county, the celebrity of whose butter is  unsurpassed, thus details his method of butter-making:    \"Our practice is not to churn the milk until it becomes thick or  loppered, the milk and cream is then churned together. The temperature  of the milk is about fifty degrees. In warm weather about a quart of  cold water is put in each pan before the milk is strained, so as to keep  it sweet as long as possible. The cellar-floor is brick. This in warm  weather is daily cleansed with cold water. A drain from the cellar  carries off the water thus applied. The churn is filled about half full  with milk, with the addition of two pails of cold water before starting  the churn. In cold weather the same quantity of warm water is applied.  When the churning is finished, which usually occupies about two hours of  time, there are then two more pails of cold water applied to raise the  butter and cool it.    The butter is then taken out of the churn and put in a large tray; this  is immediately filled with cold water, and the butter carefully washed;  after which the water is thrown off. The butter now undergoes the  process of salting; it is then placed in a cool situation, where it  stands about an hour, and is worked carefully over. This finished, it is  placed in the same"]]]
