He seized  hold of his roer, and, drawing the damp charge, freshly loaded the gun.  Aiming at the eye of one of the hideous monsters, he pulled trigger.    The loud report was followed by a heavy plunging in the water, and the  behaviour of the crocodile gave evidence of the correctness of the  hunter's aim.    After springing bodily above the surface, it fell back again, and  commenced spinning around, with a velocity that threw showers of spray  over those, who stood watching its death-struggles.    Its two companions retreated down the river, and, as the brothers saw  them depart, the thoughts of both were dwelling upon the same subject.    Both were thinking of Hendrik!  We also must go down stream, and see  what has become of him.        CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.    FROM BAD TO WORSE.    On finding himself in the water as he parted from his companions,  Hendrik had not much exertion to make.    A gentle motion of the limbs sustained him on the surface, and he was  borne onward with a velocity that promised a speedy termination of his  voyage.    Some place must soon be reached where the banks would be low enough to  be ascended, and the current not too quick to hinder him from crossing  to the shore.  He was spirited past several rocks, one of which he only  avoided with great difficulty, so swiftly did the current carry him  along.    When about a mile from his companions, as he supposed himself, he saw  that the banks on both sides were shelving and he tried to reach the  shore.    The current was still rapid as ever, and for each foot made in the  direction of the land, he was borne several yards down the channel of  the stream.    The velocity with which he was moving awoke in his mind a vague sense of  a danger not thought of before starting, and altogether different from  those that had been taken into calculation.  His voyage, so far, had  been successful.  He had escaped unharmed by rocks or crocodiles; but he  had evidence that a danger, as much, if not more to be dreaded, now  threatened him.  The water seemed gliding down an inclined plane, so  rapidly was it sweeping him on; and beyond this, directly before him, he  could hear the roaring of a cataract!  What had been at first only a  conjecture, soon became a certainty.  He was going at arrow-like speed  towards the brow of a waterfall.  Throwing all his energies into the  effort, he struggled to reach the shore at a point where the bank was  accessible.    He had nearly succeeded.  Ten feet nearer, and he would have been able  to grasp the o'erhanging bushes.  But that distance, little as it was,  could not be accomplished, and on he glided towards the engulfing fall.    On the brink of the water-precipice he saw the sharp point of a rock  jutting about three feet above the water.  More by good luck, than any  guidance on his part, he came within reach of it as he was hurried  onward.  Reaching out, he caught hold; and hugging it with both arms, he  was able to retain his hold.  His body was swung around to the leeward  of the rock, until his legs hung dangling over the fall.  Although the  force of the current was partly broken by the interposition of the rock,  it required him to exert all his strength to save himself from being  washed over.  After a time, he succeeded in gaining a footing.  There  was a little ledge on the rock just large enough for one foot, while the  other sought support on the pointed apex.  To have attempted to swim  ashore could only end in his destruction.  Though almost within leaping  distance of the bank, he had no place to spring from, and to have fallen  short, would have been fatal.  He could do nothing but remain as he was.    Hours passed, and the torture of standing in one position irksome at  that, became unbearable.  He could only obtain rest by getting into the  water again and hugging the rock with both arms as he had done before.  But this method of resting himself, if such it could be called, could  not be endured longer than two or three minutes, and he was compelled  soon to return to the upright attitude.    \"There is not the least danger of crocodiles here,\" thought he while in  the water hanging on to the rock.  \"Should one pass this way, it would  not have time for touching me, even if it were starving.\"  All night  long did he continue in this dread position.    Morning dawned, and once more he had to endure the agony of gazing on  the bank within a few feet of where he stood, though as unapproachable  as if miles of moving water separated him from it.    Fortune seemed determined to torture him to the last extreme.    There was no hope of his gaining the bank above, and it now occurred to  him to look below.  Craning out as far as he could, he made an  inspection of the fall.  It was about thirty feet in clear descent.  Below, the water ran frothing away and soon became smooth and tranquil,  as if reposing after the violent leap.    Should he allow himself to be carried over the cataract?  This was the  question he now commenced considering.  If he could only have assured  himself that there was deep water underneath, he would at once have  decided to commit himself to the descent.  But there was the probability  that he might be precipitated upon jagged rocks, and of course killed by  the fall.  Besides, he saw that the banks below were steep on both  sides, and he might have to swim for a long distance before being able  to land.  After a descent of thirty feet he might be incapable of  continuing above the surface of the water.  At all events, he would be  in no condition for a long swim.    After long and earnestly debating the question in his own mind he gave  up the thought of making the too perilous attempt.    Notwithstanding the agony arising from his own position, he was not free  from concern for his comrades left upon the rock.    Willem and Arend would in all likelihood come after him, if they had not  already done so.  One or the other, or both, might have left the rock  and been carried over the cataract in the night, unseen by him during  the darkness.    As the time passed on, his sufferings approached the point of despair.  They at length became so great that once or twice was he tempted to put  a termination to them by giving his body to the cataract, and his soul  to Him who had bestowed it.  But this demon of temptation was driven out  of his mind by a mental vision of angelic loveliness.    The remembrance of Wilhelmina Van Wyk came before him like some fair  angel, commanding him to hope and wait.  He obeyed the command.        CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.    REUNION.    Time was passing.  They upon the islet rock were getting very impatient  for the return of Congo.  They were certain that he would bring  assistance with as little delay as possible, but most of his journey  would have to be made in the night,--a dangerous time for travelling.    He had now been gone long enough to reach the camp and return.  \"Sister  Ann\" on the watch-tower of Bluebeard's castle could not have gazed more  earnestly than did they for his reappearance upon the bank above them.  Their anxious vigil was at length rewarded.  Near the hour of noon their  ears were greeted by shouts, and shortly after they saw Hans, Congo, and  Macora standing on the bank above them.  The chief was accompanied by  about a score of his followers, carrying long ropes by the direction of  Congo.    \"Where is Hendrik?\" was the first question of Hans, asked in a trembling  voice.    \"We cannot tell,\" was the reply.  \"He swam down the river in the hope of  being able to make the bank below.  We have great fear that some  misfortune has befallen him.\"    While the three yagers continued the solemn conversation, Macora took a  number of his people a short distance up the river.    Near the bank was found the prostrate trunk of a tree about fifty feet  in length.  It had long been down; and was quite dead and dry.  After  making the lines fast to one end of it, it was pushed into the stream  and directed in such a manner as to drift down to the rock on which the  two youths were standing.  The other end of the rope was firmly grasped  by several of Macora's men.    Swiftly the log, carried by the current, came in contact with the rock;  when the men, keeping the rope on a taut stretch, prevented it from  going farther.    With the nimbleness of a couple of cats, Willem and Arend sprang on to  it, and, setting themselves astride, were hauled to the bank, where both  were at length safely landed.    The first thing they saw, was the body of the elephant at which they had  fired so many shots.  The animal had at length succumbed, sinking into  its eternal sleep in spite of its implacable anger.    As the hunters were no longer in any anxiety for themselves, their  apprehensions became all the more keen for the fate of their missing  friend.  Although suffering greatly from fatigue as well as the want of  food, Willem and Arend would not stay even to eat, till a search had  been made for him.    There is no sentiment of the human mind, unless it is self esteem, that  is capable of resting on so unstable a foundation as hope.  Hendrik had  now been absent more than twenty-four hours.  The chances were a hundred  to one against their ever seeing him again, either dead or alive; and  yet they had hope.    Provided with food to eat along the way, they started down the river,--  many of the Makololo _very_ unwillingly.  They had just performed a  journey of near thirty miles in only a few hours' time, and of course  they were weary.    But this was not the only reason why their exertions were prolonged with  some reluctance.  They had been told of the manner in which Hendrik had  left his companions; and, guided by reason,--instead of a strong feeling  of friendship,--unlike Hans, Willem, and Arend, they had no hope of  seeing him again. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#16)"],[1,"his muscle.    Since his mother had left him he had seen only two or three lynxes, and  those were all much older and larger than he, and not well suited to be  his companions. But history repeats itself. One Indian-summer afternoon  he was tramping along the northern bank of the Glimmerglass, just as his  father had done two years before, and as he rounded a bend in the path  he came face to face with someone who was enough like him to have been  his twin sister. And they did as his parents had done, stood still for a  minute or two and looked at each other as if they had just found out  what they were made for. After all, life is something more than hustling  for a living, even in the woods.    But just then something else happened, and another ruling passion came  into play--the old instinct of the chase, which neither of them could  very long forget. A faint \"Quack, quack, quack,\" came up from the lake,  and they crept to the edge of the bank, side by side, and looked down.  Above them the trees stood dreamily motionless in the mellow sunshine.  Below was a steep slope of ten or fifteen feet; beyond it a tiny strip  of sandy beach, and then the quiet water. A squadron of ducks, on their  way from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf, had taken stop-over checks for  the Glimmerglass; and now they came loitering along through the dead  bulrushes, murmuring gently, in soft, mild voices, of delicious minnows  and snails, and pausing a moment now and then to put their heads under  and dabble in the mud for some particularly choice morsel. The lynxes  crouched and waited, while their stubby tails twitched nervously, their  long, narrow pupils grew still narrower, and their paws fumbled about  among the dry pine-needles, feeling for the very best footing for the  flying leap. The ducks came on, still prattling pleasantly over their  own private affairs. Closer and closer they swam, without a thought of  death waiting for them at the top of the bank, and suddenly four  splendid sets of muscles jerked like bowstrings, four long hind-legs  straightened with a mighty thrust and shove, and two big gray creatures  shot out from the brink and came sailing down through the air with their  heads up, their tails on end, their eyes blazing, and their forepaws  stretched out to grab the nearest unhappy duck. The flock broke up with  frightened cries and a wonderful whirring of wings, and in a moment  more they were far away and going like the very wind.    [Illustration: \"_They both stood still and looked at each other._\"]    But two of its members stayed behind, and presently the lynxes waded out  on the beach and sat down to eat their supper together. They talked as  much over that meal as the ducks had over theirs, but the lynx language  is very different from that of the water-fowl. Instead of soft, gentle  murmurings there were low growls and snarls as the long, white claws and  teeth tore the warm red flesh from the bones. It could hardly have been  a pleasant conversation to anyone but themselves, but I suppose they  enjoyed it as much as the choicest repartee. In truth they had good  reason to be satisfied and contented with themselves and each other, and  with what they had just done, for not every flying leap is so  successful, and not every duck is as plump and juicy as the two that  they were discussing. So they talked on in angry, threatening tones,  that sounded like quarrelling, but that really meant only a fierce,  savage kind of pleasure; and when the meal was ended, and the very last  shred of duck-flesh had disappeared, they washed their faces, and  purred, and lay still a while to visit and get acquainted.    There were many other meetings during the weeks that followed--some  under as pleasant circumstances as the first, and some not. Perhaps the  best were those of the clear, sharp days of early winter, when the sky  was blue, and the sunshine was bright, and a thin carpet of fine, dry  snow covered the floor of the forest. It was cold, of course; but they  were young and strong and healthy, and their fur was thick and warm,  like the garments of a Canadian girl. The keen air set the live blood  leaping and dancing, and they frisked and frolicked, and romped and  played, and rolled each other over and over in the snow, and were as  wildly and deliciously happy as it is ever given to two animals to be.    It was too good to last long without some kind of an interruption, and  one glorious winter evening, when the full moon was flooding the woods  with the white light that brings a touch of madness, a third young lynx  came upon the scene. And then there was trouble. The Kitten's new friend  sat back in the bushes and looked on, while he and his rival squatted  face to face in the snow and sassed each other to the utmost limits of  the lynx vocabulary, their voices rising and falling in a hideous duet,  and their eyes gleaming and glowing with a pale, yellow-green fire.  Presently there was a rush, and the fur began to fly. The snow flew,  too; and the woods rang and rang again with yelling and caterwauling,  and spitting and swearing, and all manner of abuse. The rabbits heard  it, and trembled; and the partridges, down in the cedar swamp, glanced  furtively over their shoulders and were glad it was no nearer. They bit  and scratched and clawed like two little devils, and the onlooker in the  bushes must have felt a thrill of pride over the strenuous way in which  they strove for her favors. First one was on top, and then the other.  Now our Kitten had his rival by the ears, and now by the tail. One  minute heads, legs, and bodies were all mixed up in such a snarl that it  seemed as if they could never be untangled, and the next they backed off  just long enough to catch their breath, and then flew at each other's  throats more savagely than ever. It was really more difficult than you  would suppose for either of them to get a good hold of the other, partly  because their fur was so thick, and partly because Nature had purposely  made their skins very loose, with an eye to just such performances as  this. But they managed to do a good deal of damage, nevertheless; and in  the end the pretender was thoroughly whipped, and fled away in disgrace  down the long, snowy aisles of the forest, howling as he went, while  the Kitten turned slowly and painfully to the one who was at the bottom  of all this unpleasantness. His ears were slit; one eye was shut, and  the lid of the other hung very low; he limped badly with his right  hind-leg, and many were the wounds and scratches along his breast and  sides. But he didn't care. He had won his spurs.    The story of the Kitten is told, for he was a kitten no longer.          POINTERS FROM A PORCUPINE QUILL      HE wasn't handsome--the original owner of this quill--and I can't say  that he was very smart. He was only a slow-witted, homely old porky who  once lived by the Glimmerglass. But in spite of his slow wits and his  homeliness a great many things happened to him in the course of his  life.    He was born in a hollow hemlock log, on a wild April morning, when the  north wind was whipping the lake with snow, and when winter seemed to  have come back for a season. The Glimmerglass was neither glimmering nor  glassy that morning, but he and his mother were snug and warm in their  wooden nest, and they cared little for the storm that was raging  outside.    It has been said by some that porcupines lay eggs, the hard, smooth  shells of which are furnished by a kind and thoughtful Providence for  the protection of the mothers from their prickly offspring until the  latter have fairly begun their independent existence. Other people say  that two babies invariably arrive at once, and that one of them is  always dead before it is born. But when my Porcupine discovered America  he had neither a shell on his back nor a dead twin brother by his side.  Neither was he prickly. He was covered all over with soft, furry,  dark-brown hair. If you had searched carefully along the middle of his  back you might possibly have found the points of the first quills, just  peeping through the skin; but as yet the thick fur hid them from sight  and touch unless you knew just where and how to look for them.    He was a very large baby, larger even than a new-born bear cub, and no  doubt his mother felt a justifiable pride in his size and his general  peartness. She was certainly very careful of him and very anxious for  his safety, for she kept him out of sight, and no one ever saw him  during those first days and weeks of his babyhood. She did not propose  to have any lynxes or wild-cats or other ill-disposed neighbors fondling  him until his quills were grown. After that they might give him as many  love-pats as they pleased.    He grew rapidly, as all porcupine babies do. Long hairs, tipped with  yellowish-white, came out through the dense fur, and by and by the  quills began to show. His teeth were lengthening, too, as his mother  very well knew, and between the sharp things in his mouth and those on  his back and sides he was fast becoming a very formidable nursling.  Before he was two months old she was forced to wean him, but by that  time he was quite able to travel down to the beach and feast on the  tender lily-pads and arrow-head leaves that grew in the shallow water,  within easy reach from fallen and half-submerged tree-trunks.    One June day, as he and his mother were fishing for lily-pads, each of  them out on the end of a big log, a boy came down the steep bank that  rose almost from the water's edge. He wasn't a very attractive boy. His  clothes were dirty and torn--and so was his face. His hat was gone, and  his hair had not seen a comb for weeks. The mosquitoes and black-flies  and no-see-'ems had bitten him until his skin was covered with blotches  and his eyelids were so swollen that he could hardly see. And worst of  all, he looked as if he were dying of starvation."]]]
