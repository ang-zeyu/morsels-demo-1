With respect to the exact nurture to be pursued, no rule could be  prescribed which would apply to all cases; and each individual must be  governed much by circumstances, both regarding the particular kinds of  feed at different seasons of the year, and the system of feeding. It has  been found--it may be stated--in the practice of the most successful  dairymen, that, in order to encourage the largest secretion of milk in  stalled cows, one of the best courses is, to feed in the morning, either  at the time of milking--which is preferred by many--or immediately  after, with cut feed, consisting of hay, oats, millet, or cornstalks,  mixed with shorts, and Indian linseed, or cotton-seed meal, thoroughly  moistened with water. If in winter, hot or warm water is far better than  cold. If given at milking-time, the cows will generally give down their  milk more readily. The stalls and mangers should first be thoroughly  cleansed.    [Illustration: THE FAMILY PETS.]    Roots and long hay may be given during the day; and at the evening  milking, or directly after, another generous meal of cut feed, well  moistened and mixed, as in the morning. No very concentrated food, like  grains alone, or oil-cakes, should be fed early in the morning on an  empty stomach, although it is sanctioned by the practice in the London  milk-dairies. The processes of digestion go on best when the stomach is  sufficiently distended; and for this purpose the bulk of food is almost  as important as the nutritive qualities. The flavor of some roots, as  cabbages and turnips, is more apt to be imparted to the flesh and milk  when fed on an empty stomach than otherwise. After the cows have been  milked and have finished their cut feed, they are carded and curried  down, in well-managed dairies, and then either watered in the  stall--which, in very cold or stormy weather, is far preferable--or  turned out to water in the yard. While they are out, if they are let out  at all, the stables are put in order; and, after tying them up, they are  fed with long hay, and left to themselves till the next feeding time.  This may consist of roots--such as cabbages, beets, carrots, or  turnips sliced--or of potatoes, a peck, or--if the cows are very  large--a half-bushel each, and cut feed again at the evening milking, as  in the morning; after which, water in the stall, if possible.    The less cows are exposed to the cold of winter, the better. They eat  less, thrive better, and give more milk, when kept housed all the time,  than when exposed to the cold. A case is on record, where a herd of  cows, which had usually been supplied from troughs and pipes in the  stalls, were, on account of an obstruction in the pipes, obliged to be  turned out thrice a day to be watered in the yard. The quantity of milk  instantly decreased, and in three days the diminution became very  considerable. After the pipes were mended, and the cows again watered,  as before, in their stalls, the flow of milk returned. This, however,  must be governed much by the weather; for in very mild and warm days it  may be judicious not only to let them out, but to allow them to remain  out for a short time, for the purpose of exercise.    Any one can arrange the hour for the several processes named above, to  suit himself; but, when once fixed, it should be rigidly and regularly  followed. If the regular and full feeding be neglected for even a day,  the yield of milk will immediately decline, and it will be very  difficult to restore it. It may be safely asserted, as the result of  many trials and long practice, that a larger flow of milk follows a  complete system of regularity in this respect than from a higher feeding  where this system is not adhered to.    One prime object which the dairyman should keep constantly in view is,  to maintain the animal in a sound and healthy condition. Without this,  no profit can be expected from a milch cow for any considerable length  of time; and with a view to this, there should be an occasional change  of food. But, in making changes, great care is requisite in order to  supply the needful amount of nourishment, or the cow will fall off in  flesh, and eventually in milk. It should, therefore, be remembered that  the food consumed goes not alone to the secretion of milk, but also to  the growth and maintenance of the bony structure, the flesh, the blood,  the fat, the skin, and the hair, and in exhalations from the body. These  parts of the body consist of different organic constituents. Some are  rich in nitrogen, as the fibrin of the blood and albumen; others  destitute of it, as fat; some abound in inorganic salts, phosphate of  lime, and salts of potash. To explain how the constant waste of these  substances may be supplied, a celebrated chemist observes that the  albumen, gluten, caseine, and other nitrogenized principles of food,  supply the animal with the materials requisite for the formation of  muscle and cartilage; they are, therefore, called flesh-forming  principles.    Fats, or oily matters of the food, are used to lay on fat, or for the  purpose of sustaining respiration.    Starch, sugar, gum, and a few other non-nitrogenized substances,  consisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, supply the carbon given off  in respiration, or they are used for the production of fat.    Phosphate of lime and magnesia in food principally furnish the animal  with the materials of which the bony skeleton of its body consists.    Saline substances--chlorides of sodium and potassium, sulphate and  phosphate of potash and soda, and some other mineral matters occurring  in food--supply the blood, juice of flesh, and various animal juices,  with the necessary mineral constituents.    The healthy state of an animal can thus only be preserved by a mixed  food; that is, food which contains all the proximate principles just  noticed. Starch or sugar alone cannot sustain the animal body, since  neither of them furnishes the materials to build up the fleshy parts of  the animal. When fed on substances in which an insufficient quantity of  phosphates occurs, the animal will become weak, because it does not find  any bone-producing principle in its food. Due attention should,  therefore, be paid by the feeder to the selection of food which contains  all the kinds of matter required, nitrogenized as well as  non-nitrogenized, and mineral substances; and these should be mixed  together in the proportion which experience points out as best for the  different kinds of animals, or the particular purpose for which they are  kept.    Relative to the nutrition of cows for dairy purposes, milk may be  regarded as a material for the manufacture of butter and cheese; and,  according to the purpose for which the milk is intended to be employed,  whether for the manufacture of butter or the production of cheese, the  cow should be differently fed.    Butter contains carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and no nitrogen. Cheese,  on the contrary, is rich in nitrogen. Food which contains much fatty  matter, or substances which in the animal system are readily converted  into fat, will tend to increase the proportion of cream in milk. On the  other hand, the proportion of caseine or cheesy matter in milk is  increased by the use of highly nitrogenized food. Those, then, who  desire much cream, or who produce cream for the manufacture of butter,  select food likely to increase the proportion of butter in the milk. On  the contrary, where the principal object is the production of milk rich  in curd--that is, where cheese is the object of the farmer--clover,  peas, bran-meal, and other plants which abound in legumine--a  nitrogenized organic compound, almost identical in properties and  composition with caseine, or the substance which forms the curd of  milk--will be selected.    And so the quality, as well as the quantity, of butter in the milk,  depends on the kind of food consumed and on the general health of the  animal. Cows fed on turnips in the stall always produce butter inferior  to that of cows living upon the fresh and aromatic grasses of the  pastures.    Succulent food in which water abounds--the green grass of irrigated  meadows, green clover, brewers' and distillers' refuse, and the  like--increases the quantity, rather than the quality, of the milk; and  by feeding these substances the milk-dairyman studies his own interest,  and makes thin milk without diluting it with water--though, in the  opinion of some, this may be no more legitimate than watering the milk.    But, though the yield of milk may be increased by succulent or watery  food, it should be given so as not to interfere with the health of the  cow.    Food rich in starch, gum, or sugar, which are the respiratory elements,  an excess of which goes to the production of fatty matters, increases  the butter in milk. Quietness promotes the secretion of fat in animals  and increases the butter. Cheese will be increased by food rich in  albumen, such as the leguminous plants.    [Illustration: BUYING CATTLE.]    The most natural, and of course the healthiest, food for milch cows in  summer, is the green grass of the pastures; and when these fail from  drought or over-stocking, the complement of nourishment may be made up  with green clover, green oats, barley, millet, or corn-fodder and  cabbage-leaves, or other succulent vegetables; and if these are wanting,  the deficiency may be partly supplied with shorts, Indian-meal, linseed  or cotton-seed meal. Green grass is more nutritious than hay, which  always loses somewhat of its nutritive properties in curing; the amount  of the loss depending chiefly on the mode of curing, and the length of  exposure to sun and rain. But, apart from this, grass is more easily and  completely digested than hay, though the digestion of the latter may be  greatly aided by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#16)"],[1,"every  physician, yes, to the helpful influence of every man in practical life.  The intemperate man may suffer from his inability to resist his desire  for whiskey. The idea of his visit to the saloon finds the channels of  discharge open. We argue with him, we tempt him by attractions which  lead to other ways, we suggest to him that he spend those evening hours  perhaps with friends or with books for which we awaken his interest; we  do it as impressively as we can, we appeal to his friendly feeling for  us; and if again the hour comes in which the desire for the artificial  stimulation sets in with a motor impulse towards the bottle, the  channels for discharge have now been blocked. The idea of the opposite  action arises, it associates itself with the emotions which we stirred  up in his mind, it associates itself with the respect for the adviser,  and thus new clusters of thought reenforce that idea of action which we  suggested, and this opposite line of action now finds a minimum  resistance because our appeal has opened beforehand the gate. The desire  for the book works itself out into action while the desire for the cup  finds increased resistance.    Just this is the kind of suggestion with which we correct faulty action  everywhere in our social circle; and yet small steps lead on from here  to the case where perhaps the desire for alcohol has reached that  pathological intensity in which the equilibrium is entirely disturbed  and cannot be repaired without suggestions of a much more powerful  character, given in a state of artificially increased suggestibility--in  hypnotism. The principle of opening certain channels of discharge for  the purpose of closing the opposite channels remains in the extreme case  the same as in the more ordinary cases. The impulse to drink is a  positive one, but the principle is not different where the impulse is  negative. A friend who comes from the quiet country may feel unable to  pass the busy square of the city. The fear of an accident holds back his  steps, he cannot give the impulse to walk through the crowded rush of  vehicles. Now either by words of advice, by persuasion or by showing the  way, we may apply our suggestion, we open the channels of discharge for  the necessary movements and thus decrease the excitability of those  centers in which nervous fear was playing. And again small steps lead  from here to the case of the psychasthenic sufferer whose phobia does  not allow him to cross any square and where reenforced suggestion has to  break open the ways for the walking movement when the square is reached.    Thus we are not far from a causal understanding of suggestive influences  wherever actions are concerned, where movements are to be reenforced or  to be suppressed and where antagonism of the motor paths is involved.  But that does not seem to lead us nearer to the much larger group of  states in which the whole suggestive process concerns apparently the  interplay of ideas alone, where not actions but impressions are  controlled by suggestion, where not impulses but thoughts are  strengthened or inhibited. Here lies the real psychophysical problem  which has been by far too much neglected in scientific psychology and  has almost been hidden and made to disappear in the wonderful accounts  of the hypnotists. But all those mysterious stories as to the  achievements of suggestion cannot help so long as we do not understand  the working of the process, and we shall have the better chance to  understand it the more we keep away from the uncanny and mysterious  results which refer to the most complex conditions, and rather seek to  analyze the state in its simplest forms and compare it with other simple  mental processes. The psychology of suggestion has suffered too much by  the fascination which its most complex forms exert on a trivial  curiosity.    Yet the problem of suggestion in the field of ideas stands after all not  isolated. Instead of connecting it with the weird reports of mystic  influence from man to man, let us rather link it with the simple  experience of attention. There is no pulse-beat of our life in which  attention does not play its little role. But does not attention share  with suggestion the characteristic feature that some contents of  consciousness are reenforced and others are suppressed? This negative,  this suppressing character of attention is not a chance by-product, it  is most essential. There is no attention without it. If I am studying, I  do not hear the conversation around me, and if I listen to the  conversation, my studies in hand become inhibited. If I enjoy the play  on the stage and give to it my full attention, my memories of the day's  work are suppressed; if I think of the happenings of the day, I am not  attentive to the play and hardly notice what is going on. The inhibited  impression may often disappear entirely. While I am reading I am not at  all aware of the tactual and muscular sensations in my legs, and if I am  completely absorbed by my book, I may not even notice that the bell  rings. In short, we have here as the most characteristic relation, just  as in suggestion, the fact that one mental state becomes vivid, and that  others are losing ground, become less vivid, are inhibited and perhaps  disappear entirely.    Of course, to point to the similarity between suggestion and attention  is not a real explanation. It may be answered that attention simply  offers the same difficulties once more. How can we explain in the  attention process the fact that one idea, the one attended to, becomes  vivid and that others evaporate? The difficulty evidently cannot be  removed by simply saying that only one sensorial process can be  developed in the brain at one time. The popular descriptions of  attention easily make it appear as if such were the solution of the  problem. If one sensorial brain part is intensely engaged, the remainder  of the brain is condemned to a kind of inactivity. Yet such a dogma is  hardly better than the old-fashioned one that the soul can have only one  idea at a time. We know too well now that the psychophysical system is  an extremely complex equilibrium of millions of elements. Thus every  change must be explained with reference to this complex manifold. Above  all, the facts simply contradict such an over-simple explanation,  inasmuch as it is not at all true that only one content of consciousness  can become vivid. Our attention does not focus upon one point at all but  may illuminate a large field and thus give vividness to various complex  groups. If I am thinking about a scientific problem, an abundance of  reminiscences of previous reading and imaginative ideas of possible  solutions, associative thoughts and conclusions are with equal vividness  before my mind and the forthcoming thought may be influenced by this  total combination. I have no right whatever to say that the idea of a  certain solution excludes there in my mind the consideration of the  books which I have read and of the discussions which I have heard.  Emotions may be superadded. In short, a world of mental states may be  held together by one act of attention. And new and ever new thoughts  are shooting in, and all still find place there in the field attended  to, while on the other hand my slight headache is inhibited and an  appointment is forgotten. At a gay banquet, my attention may be given to  the whole hall with all its color effects and its flowers, and to all  that the table offers and to the music from the orchestra and to the  jokes of my neighbors. It is not true that any one of those parts  suppresses the vividness of the others, they seem rather to maintain and  to help one another; and yet in the next moment, my neighbor may bring  me news which absorbs my mind entirely and leaves no room for the  flowers and the music and the meal. How far can psychology do justice to  these characteristics of attention?    There seems to be but one way. The attended-to idea does not exclude  every other idea, but it does exclude the opposite idea, and opposite to  each other is here again that pair of ideas which lead to opposite  actions, to opposite psychophysical attitudes. We must remember here the  psychomotor character of our brain processes which we so fully  discussed. We recognized the fundamental truth that there is no  sensorial state which is not at the same time the starting-point for  motor reaction. We recognized that the brain is by its whole  psychological development a great switchboard which transfers incoming  currents into outgoing ones and that its biological meaning lies in the  fact that it is the center piece of an arc which leads from the sense  organs to the muscles. We cannot conceive of those relations as complex  enough; we know, of course, that millions of nerve fibers lead from the  periphery to the highest psychophysical apparatus in the cortex of the  brain and that millions of fibers bring about the interrelation between  these central stations, but we must never forget that millions of fibers  also represent the outgoing paths and that they too lead down to lower  central motor instruments which are again in numberless corelations. Any  impression is thus a starting point for attitudes and reactions and it  is an empty abstraction to consider it otherwise. An idea is never,  psychophysically considered, the end of the process, it is always also a  beginning. No external action may follow, but the mental impulse to such  is nevertheless starting in the highest center.    If we look at the landscape, every single spot of color, reaching a  nerve fiber in our eye and finally a sensory cell in our brain, is there  the starting point for an impulse to make an eye movement in the  direction of the seen point. The eye may remain entirely quiet as the  impulse to move to the right and to the left, to move up and to move  down, may be equally strong, but those thousands of"]]]
