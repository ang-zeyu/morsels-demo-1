The negro also found  friends in all the settled portions of Iowa, and at the outbreak of the  Civil War a lively traffic was being developed, extending from Lawrence,  Kansas, to Keokuk, Iowa.    There is respectable authority for a variety of opinions as to the  requirements of the rendition clause in the Constitution and of the Act  of Congress of 1793 to facilitate the return of fugitives from service  or labor; but there is no respectable authority in support of the view  that neither the spirit nor the letter of the law was violated by  the supporters of the Underground Railroad. This was a source of real  weakness to anti-slavery leaders in politics. It was always true that  only a small minority of their numbers were actual violators of the law,  yet such was their relation to the organized anti-slavery movement that  responsibility attached to all. The platform of the Liberty party for  1844 declared that the provisions of the Constitution for reclaiming  fugitive slaves were dangerous to liberty and ought to be abrogated.  It further declared that the members of the party would treat these  provisions as void, because they involved an order to commit an immoral  act. The platform thus explicitly committed the party to the support  of the policy of rendering aid to fugitive slaves. Four years later  the platform of the Free-soil party contained no reference whatever to  fugitive slaves, but that of 1852 denounced the Fugitive Slave Act of  1850 as repugnant to the Constitution and the spirit of Christianity and  denied its binding force on the American people. The Republican platform  of 1856 made no reference to the subject.    The Underground Railroad filled an insignificant place in the general  plan for emancipation, even in the minds of the directors. It was a  lesser task preparatory to the great work. As to the numbers of slaves  who gained their freedom by means of it, there is a wide range of  opinion. Statements in Congress by Southern members that a hundred  thousand had escaped must be regarded as gross exaggerations. In any  event the loss was confined chiefly to the border States. Besides, it  has been stated with some show of reason that the danger of servile  insurrection was diminished by the escape of potential leaders.    From the standpoint of the great body of anti-slavery men who expected  to settle the slavery question by peaceable means, it was a calamity  of the first magnitude that, just at the time when conditions were  most favorable for transferring the active crusade from the general  Government to the separate States, public attention should be directed  to the one point at which the conflict was most acute and irrepressible.    Previous to 1850 there had been no general acrimonious debate in  Congress on the rendition of fugitive slaves. About half of those who  had previously escaped from bondage had not taken the trouble to go  as far as Canada, but were living at peace in the Northern States. Few  people at the North knew or cared anything about the details of a law  that had been on the statute books since 1793. Members of Congress were  duly warned of the dangers involved in any attempt to enforce a more  stringent law than the previous act which had proved a dead letter.  To those who understood the conditions, the new law also was doomed to  failure. So said Senator Butler of South Carolina. An attempt to enforce  it would be met by violence.    This prediction came true. The twenty thousand potential victims  residing in Northern States were thrown into panic. Some rushed off to  Canada; others organized means for protection. A father and son from  Baltimore came to a town in Pennsylvania to recover a fugitive. An alarm  was sounded; men, mostly colored, rushed to the protection of the one  whose liberty was threatened. Two Quakers appeared on the scene  and warned the slavehunters to desist and upon their refusal one  slave-hunter was instantly killed and the other wounded. The fugitive  was conveyed to a place of safety, and to the murderers no punishment  was meted out, though the general Government made strenuous efforts to  discover and punish them. In New York, though Gerrit Smith and a local  clergyman with a few assistants rescued a fugitive from the officers of  the law and sent him to Canada, openly proclaiming and justifying the  act, no attempt was made to punish the offenders.    After a dozen years of intense and ever-increasing excitement, when  other causes of friction between North and South had apparently been  removed and good citizens in the two sections were rejoicing at  the prospect of an era of peace and harmony, public attention was  concentrated upon the one problem of conduct which would not admit of  peaceable legal adjustment. Abolitionists had always been stigmatized as  lawbreakers whose aim was the destruction of slavery in utter disregard  of the rights of the States. This charge was absolutely false; their  settled program involved full recognition of state and municipal control  over slavery. Yet after public attention had become fixed upon conduct  on the part of the abolitionists which was illegal, it was difficult to  escape the implication that their whole course was illegal. This was the  tragic significance of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.        CHAPTER IX. BOOKS AS ANTI-SLAVERY WEAPONS    Whittier offered up \"thanks for the fugitive slave law; for it gave  occasion for 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'\" Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe had been  mistress of a station on the Underground Railroad at Cincinnati, the  storm-center of the West, and out of her experience she has transmitted  to the world a knowledge of the elemental and tragic human experiences  of the slaves which would otherwise have been restricted to a select  few. The mistress of a similar station in eastern Indiana, though she  held novel reading a deadly sin, said: \"'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is not  a novel, it is a record of facts. I myself have listened to the same  stories.\" The reading public in all lands soon became sympathetic  participants in the labors of those who, in defiance of law, were  lending a hand to the aspirants for liberty. At the time of the  publication of the story in book form in March, 1852, America was being  profoundly stirred by the stories of fugitives who had escaped from  European despotism. Mrs. Stowe refers to these incidents in her  question: \"When despairing Hungarian fugitives make their way, against  all the search-warrants and authorities of their lawful governments to  America, press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome.  When despairing African fugitives do the same thing--it is--what IS it?\"  Little did she think that when the eloquence of the Hungarian refugee  had been forgotten, the story of Eliza and Uncle Tom would ring  throughout the world.    The book did far more than vindicate the conduct of those who rendered  assistance to the fugitive from slavery; it let in daylight upon the  essential nature of slavery. Humane and just masters are shown to be  forced into participation in acts which result in intolerable cruelty.  Full justice is done to the noble and admirable character of Southern  slave-owners. The author had been a guest in the home of the \"Shelbys,\"  in Kentucky. She had taken great pains to understand the Southern point  of view on the subject of slavery; she had entered into the real trials  and difficulties involved in any plan of emancipation. St. Clair,  speaking to Miss Ophelia, his New England cousin, says:    \"If we emancipate, are you willing to educate? How many families of your  town would take in a negro man or woman, teach them, bear with them, and  seek to make them Christians? How many merchants would take Adolph, if  I wanted to make him a clerk; or mechanics, if I wanted to teach him a  trade? If I wanted to put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools  are there in the Northern States that would take them in? How many  families that would board them? And yet they are as white as many a  woman north or south. You see, cousin, I want justice done us. We are in  a bad position. We are the more obvious oppressors of the negro; but  the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally  severe.\"    Throughout the book the idea is elaborated in many ways. Miss Ophelia  is introduced for the purpose of contrasting Northern ignorance and New  England prejudice with the patience and forbearance of the better class  of slave-owners of the South. The genuine affection of an unspoiled  child for negro friends is made especially emphatic. Miss Ophelia  objected to Eva's expressions of devotion to Uncle Tom. Her father  insists that his daughter shall not be robbed of the free utterance of  her high regard, observing that \"the child is the only true democrat.\"  There is only one Simon Legree in the book, and he is of New England  extraction. The story is as distinctly intended to inform Northern  ignorance and to remove Northern prejudice as it is to justify the  conduct of abolitionists.    What was the effect of the publication? In European countries far  removed from local partizan prejudice, it was immediately received as  a great revelation of the spirit of liberty. It was translated into  twenty-three different languages. So devoted were the Italians to the  reading of the story that there was earnest effort to suppress its  circulation. As a drama it proved a great success, not only in America  and England but in France and other countries as well. More than a  million copies of the story were sold in the British Empire. Lord  Palmerston avers that he had not read a novel for thirty years, yet  he read Uncle Tom's Cabin three times and commended the book for the  statesmanship displayed in it.    What is in the story to call forth such commendation from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#16)"],[1,"ption,  it may be said, having, by lapse of time, acquired the merit of general  inapplicability to the present state of things:--\"My dear friend, there  is scarcely a member whose purse I do not know to a sixpence, and whose  very soul almost I could not purchase at the offer. The reason former  Ministers have been deceived in this matter is evident--they never  considered the temper of the people they had to deal with. I have known  a minister so weak as to offer an avaricious old rascal a star and  garter, and attempt to bribe a young rogue, who set no value upon money,  with a lucrative employment. I pursue methods as opposite as the poles,  and therefore my administration has been attended with a different  effect.\" \"Patriots,\" elsewhere says Walpole, \"spring up like mushrooms.  I could raise fifty of them within four-and-twenty hours. I have raised  many of them in one night. It is but refusing to gratify an unreasonable  or insolent demand, and _up starts a patriot_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DR. JOHNSON'S CRITICISMS.    Johnson decided literary questions like a lawyer, not like a legislator.  He never examined foundations where a point was already ruled. His whole  code of criticism rested on pure assumption, for which he sometimes gave  a precedent or authority, but rarely troubled himself to give a reason  drawn from the nature of things. He judged of all works of the imagination  by the standard established among his own contemporaries. Though he  allowed Homer to have been a greater man than Virgil, he seems to have  thought the AEneid to have been a greater poem than the Iliad. Indeed, he  well might have thought so; for he preferred Pope's _Iliad_ to Homer's.  He pronounced that after Hoole's translation of _Tasso_, Fairfax's would  hardly be reprinted. He could see no merit in our fine old English  ballads, and always spoke with the most provoking contempt of Dr.  Percy's fondness for them.    Of all the great original works which appeared during his time,  Richardson's novels alone excited his admiration. He could see little  or no merit in _Tom Jones_, in _Gulliver's Travels_, or in _Tristram  Shandy_. To Thomson's _Castle of Indolence_ he vouchsafed only a line of  cold commendation--of commendation much colder than what he has bestowed  on _The Creation_ of that portentous bore, Sir Richard Blackmore. Gray  was, in his dialect, a barren rascal. Churchill was a blockhead. The  contempt which he felt for Macpherson was, indeed, just; but it was, we  suspect, just by by chance. He criticized Pope's epitaphs excellently.  But his observations on Shakspeare's plays, and Milton's poems, seem to  us as wretched as if they had been written by Rymer himself, whom we  take to have been the worst critic that ever lived.           *       *       *       *       *      GIBBON'S HOUSE, AT LAUSANNE    The house of Gibbon, in which he completed his \"Decline and Fall,\" is  in the lower part of the town of Lausanne, behind the church of St.  Francis, and on the right of the road leading down to Ouchy. Both the  house and the garden have been much changed. The wall of the Hotel  Gibbon occupies the site of his summer-house, and the _berceau_ walk has  been destroyed to make room for the garden of the hotel; but the terrace  looking over the lake, and a few acacias, remain.    Gibbon's record of the completion of his great labour is very impressive.  \"It was on the day, or rather the night, of the 27th of June, 1787,  between the hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last line of  the last page, in a summer-house in my garden. After laying down my pen,  I took several turns in a _berceau_, or covered walk of acacias, which  commands a prospect of the country, the lake, and the mountains. The  air was temperate, the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon was  reflected from the waves, and all nature was silent.\"    At a little inn at Morges, about two miles distant from Lausanne, Lord  Byron wrote the _Prisoner of Chillon_, in the short space of _two days_,  during which he was detained here by bad weather, June 1816: \"thus  adding one more deathless association to the already immortalized  localities of the Lake.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ORIGIN OF \"BOZ.\" (DICKENS.)    A fellow passenger with Mr. Dickens in the _Britannia_ steam-ship,  across the Atlantic, inquired of the author the origin of his signature,  \"Boz.\" Mr. Dickens replied that he had a little brother who resembled  so much the Moses in the _Vicar of Wakefield_, that he used to call him  Moses also; but a younger girl, who could not then articulate plainly,  was in the habit of calling him Bozie or Boz. This simple circumstance  made him assume that name in the first article he risked to the public,  and therefore he continued the name, as the first effort was approved  of.           *       *       *       *       *      BOSWELL'S \"LIFE OF JOHNSON.\"    Sir John Malcolm once asked Warren Hastings, who was a contemporary and  companion of Dr. Johnson and Boswell, what was his real estimation  of Boswell's _Life of Johnson_? \"Sir,\" replied Hastings, \"it is the  _dirtiest_ book in my library;\" then proceeding, he added: \"I knew  Boswell intimately; and I well remember, when his book first made its  appearance, Boswell was so full of it, that he could neither think nor  talk of anything else; so much so, that meeting Lord Thurlow hurrying  through Parliament-street to get to the House of Lords, where an  important debate was expected, for which he was already too late,  Boswell had the temerity to stop and accost him with \"Have you read my  book?\" \"Yes,\" replied Lord Thurlow, with one of his strongest curses,  \"every word of it; I could not help it.\"           *       *       *       *       *      PATRONAGE OF AUTHORS.    In the reigns of William III., of Anne, and of George I., even such men  as Congreve and Addison could scarcely have been able to live like  gentlemen by the mere sale of their writings. But the deficiency of the  natural demand for literature was, at the close of the seventeenth, and  at the beginning of the eighteenth century, more than made up by the  artificial encouragement--by a vast system of bounties and premiums.  There was, perhaps, never a time at which the rewards of literary merit  were so splendid--at which men who could write well found such easy  admittance into the most distinguished society, and to the highest  honours of the state. The chiefs of both the great parties into which  the kingdom was divided, patronized literature with emulous munificence.    Congreve, when he had scarcely attained his majority, was rewarded for  his first comedy with places which made him independent for life. Rowe  was not only poet laureate, but land-surveyor of the Customs in the port  of London, clerk of the council to the Prince of Wales, and secretary  of the Presentations to the Lord Chancellor. Hughes was secretary  to the Commissioners of the Peace. Ambrose Phillips was judge of the  Prerogative Court in Ireland. Locke was Commissioner of Appeals and of  the Board of Trade. Newton was Master of the Mint. Stepney and Prior  were employed in embassies of high dignity and importance. Gay, who  commenced life as apprentice to a silk-mercer, became a secretary of  Legation at five-and-twenty. It was to a poem on the death of Charles II.,  and to \"the City and Country Mouse,\" that Montague owed his introduction  into public life, his earldom, his garter, and his auditorship of the  Exchequer. Swift, but for the unconquerable prejudice of the queen,  would have been a bishop. Oxford, with his white staff in his hand,  passed through the crowd of his suitors to welcome Parnell, when that  ingenious writer deserted the Whigs. Steele was a Commissioner of  Stamps, and a member of Parliament. Arthur Mainwaring was a Commissioner  of the Customs, and Auditor of the Imprest. Tickell was secretary to the  Lords Justices of Ireland. Addison was Secretary of State.    But soon after the succession of the throne of Hanover, a change took  place. The supreme power passed to a man who cared little for poetry  or eloquence. Walpole paid little attention to books, and felt little  respect for authors. One of the coarse jokes of his friend, Sir Charles  Hanbury Williams, was far more pleasing to him than Thomson's _Seasons_  or Richardson's _Pamela_.           *       *       *       *       *      LEARNING FRENCH.    When Brummell was obliged by want of money, and debt, and all that, to  retire to France, he knew no French; and having obtained a grammar for  the purpose of study, his friend Scrope Davies was asked what progress  Brummell had made in French. He responded, that Brummell had been  stopped, like Buonaparte in Russia, by the _Elements_.    \"I have put this pun into _Beppo_, (says Lord Byron), which is a fair  exchange and no robbery, for Scrope made his fortune at several dinners,  (as he owned himself,) by repeating occasionally, as his own, some of  the buffooneries with which I had encountered him in the morning.\"           *       *       *       *       *      JOHNSON'S CLUB-ROOM.    In a paper in the _Edinburgh Review_, we find this cabinet picture:--The  club-room is before us, and the table, on which stands the omelet for  Nugent, and the lemons for Johnson. There are assembled those heads  which live for ever on the canvas of Reynolds. There are the spectacles  of Burke, and the tall thin form of Langton; the courtly sneer of  Beauclerc, and the beaming smile of Garrick; Gibbon tapping his snuff-box,  and Sir Joshua with his trumpet in his ear. In the foreground is that  strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among  whom we have been brought up--the gigantic body, the huge massy face,  seamed with the scars of disease; the brown coat, the black worsted  stockings, the grey wig, with the scorched foretop; the dirty hands, the  nails bitten"]]]
