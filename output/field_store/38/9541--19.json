Americans were  naturally grateful for the aid given them by the French in their own  struggle for freedom, and saw with eager delight the approaching  liberation of their liberators. But as the drama unrolled itself a  sharp, though very unequal, division of opinion appeared. In New  England, especially, there were many who were shocked at the proceedings  of the French, at their violence, at their Latin cruelty in anger, and,  above all perhaps, at that touch of levity which comes upon the Latin  when he is face to face with death. Massacres and _carmagnoles_ did not  strike the typical Massachusetts merchant as the methods by which  God-fearing men should protest against oppression. The strict military  government which succeeded to, controlled and directed in a national  fashion the violent mood of the people--that necessary martial law which  we call \"the Terror\"--seemed even less acceptable to his fundamentally  Whiggish political creed. Yet--and it is a most significant fact--the  bulk of popular American opinion was not shocked by these things. It  remained steadily with the French through all those events which  alienated opinion--even Liberal opinion--in Europe. It was perhaps  because European opinion, especially English opinion, even when Liberal,  was at bottom aristocratic, while the American people were already a  democracy. But the fact is certain. By the admission of those American  writers who deplore it and fail to comprehend it, the great mass of the  democracy of America continued, through good and evil repute, to extend  a vivid and indulgent sympathy to the democracy of France.    The division of sympathies which had thus become apparent was converted  into a matter of practical politics by the entry of England into the war  which a Coalition was waging against the French Republic. That  intervention at once sharpened the sympathies of both sides and gave  them a practical purpose. England and France were now arrayed against  each other, and Americans, though their Government remained neutral,  arrayed themselves openly as partisans of either combatant. The division  followed almost exactly the lines of the earlier quarrel which had begun  to appear as the true meaning of Hamilton's policy discovered itself.  The Hamiltonians were for England. The Jeffersonians were for France.    A war of pamphlets and newspapers followed, into the details of which it  is not necessary to go. The Federalists, with the tide going steadily  against them, had the good luck to secure the aid of a pen which had no  match in Europe. The greatest master of English controversial prose that  ever lived was at that time in America. Normally, perhaps, his  sympathies would have been with the Democrats. But love of England was  ever the deepest and most compelling passion of the man who habitually  abused her institutions so roundly. The Democrats were against his  fatherland, and so the supporters of Hamilton found themselves defended  in a series of publications over the signature of \"Peter Porcupine\" with  all the energy and genius which belonged only to William Cobbett.    A piquancy of the contest was increased by the fact that it was led on  either side by members of the Administration. Washington had early put  forth a Declaration of Neutrality, drawn up by Randolph, who, though  leaning if anything to Jefferson's side, took up a more or less  intermediate position between the parties. Both sides professed to  accept the principle of neutrality, but their interpretations of it were  widely different. Jefferson did not propose to intervene in favour of  France, but he did not think that Americans were bound to disguise their  moral sympathies. They would appear, he thought, both ungrateful and  false to the first principles of their own commonwealth if, whatever  limitation prudence might impose in their action, they did not _desire_  that France should be victorious over the Coalition of Kings. The great  majority of the American people took the same view. When Genet, the  envoy of the newly constituted Republic, arrived from France, he  received an ovation which Washington himself at the height of his glory  could hardly have obtained. Nine American citizens out of ten hastened  to mount the tricolour cockade, to learn the \"Marseillaise,\" and to take  their glasses to the victory of the sister Republic. So strong was the  wave of popular enthusiasm that the United States might perhaps have  been drawn into active co-operation with France had France been better  served by her Minister.    Genet was a Girondin, and the Girondins, perhaps through that defect in  realism which ruined them at home, were not good diplomatists. It is  likely enough that the warmth of his reception deranged his judgment; at  any rate he misread its significance. He failed to take due account of  that sensitiveness of national feeling in a democracy which, as a  Frenchman of that time, he should have been specially able to  appreciate. He began to treat the resources of the United States as if  they had already been placed at the disposal of France, and, when very  properly rebuked, he was foolish enough to attempt to appeal to the  nation against its rulers. The attitude of the Secretary of State ought  to have warned him of the imprudence of his conduct. No man in America  was a better friend to France than Jefferson; but he stood up manfully  to Genet in defence of the independent rights of his country, and the  obstinacy of the ambassador produced, as Jefferson foresaw that it must  produce, a certain reaction of public feeling by which the Anglophil  party benefited.    At the close of the year 1793, Jefferson, weary of endless contests with  Hamilton, whom he accused, not without some justification, of constantly  encroaching on his colleague's proper department, not wholly satisfied  with the policy of the Government and perhaps feeling that Genet's  indiscretions had made his difficult task for the moment impossible,  resigned his office. He would have done so long before had not  Washington, sincerely anxious throughout these troubled years to hold  the balance even between the parties, repeatedly exerted all his  influence to dissuade him. The following year saw the \"Whiskey  Insurrection\" in Pennsylvania--a popular protest against Hamilton's  excise measures. Jefferson more than half sympathized with the rebels.  Long before, on the occasion of Shay's insurrection, he had expressed  with some exaggeration a view which has much more truth in it than those  modern writers who exclaim in horror at his folly could be expected to  understand--the view that the readiness of people to rebel against their  rulers is no bad test of the presence of democracy among them. He had  even added that he hoped the country would never pass ten years without  a rebellion of some sort. In the present case he had the additional  motives for sympathy that he himself disapproved of the law against  which Pennsylvania was in revolt, and detested its author. Washington  could not be expected to take the same view. He was not anti-democratic  like Hamilton; he sincerely held the theory of the State set forth in  the Declaration of Independence. But he was something of an aristocrat,  and very much of a soldier. As an aristocrat he was perhaps touched with  the illusion which was so fatal to his friend Lafayette, the illusion  that privilege can be abolished and yet the once privileged class  partially retain its ascendancy by a sort of tacit acknowledgment by  others of its value. As a soldier he disliked disorder and believed in  discipline. As a commander in the war he had not spared the rod, and had  even complained of Congress for mitigating the severity of military  punishments. It may be that the \"Whiskey Insurrection,\" which he  suppressed with prompt and drastic energy, led him for the first time to  lean a little to the Hamiltonian side. At any rate he was induced,  though reluctantly and only under strong pressure, to introduce into a  Message to Congress a passage reflecting on the Democratic Societies  which were springing up everywhere and gaining daily in power; and in  return found himself attacked, sometimes with scurrility, in the more  violent organs of the Democracy.    Washington's personal ascendancy was, however, sufficient to prevent the  storm from breaking while he was President. It was reserved for his  successor. In 1797 his second term expired. He had refused a third,  thereby setting an important precedent which every subsequent President  has followed, and bade farewell to politics in an address which is among  the great historical documents of the Republic. The two points  especially emphasized were long the acknowledged keynotes of American  policy: the avoidance at home of \"sectional\" parties--that is, of  parties following geographical lines--and abroad the maintenance of a  strict independence of European entanglements and alliances.    Had a Presidential election then been what it became later, a direct  appeal to the popular vote, it is probable that Jefferson would have  been the second President of the United States. But the Electoral  College was still a reality, and its majority leant to Federalism.  Immeasurably the ablest man among the Federalists was Hamilton, but for  many reasons he was not an \"available\" choice. He was not a born  American. He had made many and formidable personal enemies even within  the party. Perhaps the shadow on his birth was a drawback; perhaps also  the notorious freedom of his private life--for the strength of the party  lay in Puritan New England. At any rate the candidate whom the  Federalists backed and succeeded in electing was John Adams of  Massachusetts. By the curiously unworkable rule, soon repealed, of the  original Constitution, which gave the Vice-Presidency to the candidate  who had the second largest number of votes, Jefferson found himself "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#16)"],[1," or ovate-lanceolate, acuminate or  awned, 5-nerved, lateral nerves being marginal and hairy.
