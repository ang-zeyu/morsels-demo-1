These consisted of the  1st Devons, the 1st Liverpools, and the 2nd Gordon Highlanders, with the  1st Gloucesters, the 2nd King's Royal Rifles, and the 2nd Rifle Brigade,  reinforced later by the Manchesters. The cavalry included the 5th  Dragoon Guards, the 5th Lancers, a detachment of 19th Hussars, the Natal  Carabineers, the Natal Mounted Police, and the Border Mounted Rifles,  reinforced later by the Imperial Light Horse, a fine body of men raised  principally among the refugees from the Rand. For artillery there  were the 21st, 42nd, and 53rd batteries of field artillery, and No. 10  Mountain Battery, with the Natal Field Artillery, the guns of which were  too light to be of service, and the 23rd Company of Royal Engineers. The  whole force, some eight or nine thousand strong, was under the immediate  command of Sir George White, with Sir Archibald Hunter, fresh from the  Soudan, General French, and General Ian Hamilton as his lieutenants.    The first shock of the Boers, then, must fall upon 4000 men. If these  could be overwhelmed, there were 8000 more to be defeated or masked.  Then what was there between them and the sea? Some detachments of local  volunteers, the Durban Light Infantry at Colenso, and the Natal Royal  Rifles, with some naval volunteers at Estcourt. With the power of the  Boers and their mobility it is inexplicable how the colony was saved. We  are of the same blood, the Boers and we, and we show it in our failings.  Over-confidence on our part gave them the chance, and over-confidence  on theirs prevented them from instantly availing themselves of it. It  passed, never to come again.    The outbreak of war was upon October 11th. On the 12th the Boer forces  crossed the frontier both on the north and on the west. On the 13th they  occupied Charlestown at the top angle of Natal. On the 15th they had  reached Newcastle, a larger town some fifteen miles inside the border.  Watchers from the houses saw six miles of canvas-tilted bullock wagons  winding down the passes, and learned that this was not a raid but an  invasion. At the same date news reached the British headquarters of  an advance from the western passes, and of a movement from the  Buffalo River on the east. On the 13th Sir George White had made a  reconnaissance in force, but had not come in touch with the enemy. On  the 15th six of the Natal Police were surrounded and captured at one of  the drifts of the Buffalo River. On the 18th our cavalry patrols came  into touch with the Boer scouts at Acton Homes and Besters Station,  these being the voortrekkers of the Orange Free State force. On the 18th  also a detachment was reported from Hadders Spruit, seven miles north of  Glencoe Camp. The cloud was drifting up, and it could not be long before  it would burst.    Two days later, on the early morning of October 20th, the forces came  at last into collision. At half-past three in the morning, well before  daylight, the mounted infantry picket at the junction of the roads from  Landmans and Vants Drifts was fired into by the Doornberg commando, and  retired upon its supports. Two companies of the Dublin Fusiliers were  sent out, and at five o'clock on a fine but misty morning the whole of  Symons's force was under arms with the knowledge that the Boers were  pushing boldly towards them. The khaki-clad lines of fighting men stood  in their long thin ranks staring up at the curves of the saddle-back  hills to the north and east of them, and straining their eyes to catch a  glimpse of the enemy. Why these same saddle-back hills were not occupied  by our own people is, it must be confessed, an insoluble mystery. In a  hollow on one flank were the 18th Hussars and the mounted infantry. On  the other were the eighteen motionless guns, limbered up and ready, the  horses fidgeting and stamping in the raw morning air.    And then suddenly--could that be they? An officer with a telescope  stared intently and pointed. Another and another turned a steady field  glass towards the same place. And then the men could see also, and a  little murmur of interest ran down the ranks.    A long sloping hill--Talana Hill--olive-green in hue, was stretching  away in front of them. At the summit it rose into a rounded crest. The  mist was clearing, and the curve was hard-outlined against the limpid  blue of the morning sky. On this, some two and a half miles or three  miles off, a little group of black dots had appeared. The clear edge of  the skyline had become serrated with moving figures. They clustered into  a knot, then opened again, and then--    There had been no smoke, but there came a long crescendo hoot, rising  into a shrill wail. The shell hummed over the soldiers like a great  bee, and sloshed into soft earth behind them. Then another--and yet  another--and yet another. But there was no time to heed them, for there  was the hillside and there the enemy. So at it again with the good old  murderous obsolete heroic tactics of the British tradition! There are  times when, in spite of science and book-lore, the best plan is the  boldest plan, and it is well to fly straight at your enemy's throat,  facing the chance that your strength may fail before you can grasp it.  The cavalry moved off round the enemy's left flank. The guns dashed to  the front, unlimbered, and opened fire. The infantry were moved round in  the direction of Sandspruit, passing through the little town of Dundee,  where the women and children came to the doors and windows to cheer  them. It was thought that the hill was more accessible from that side.  The Leicesters and one field battery--the 67th--were left behind to  protect the camp and to watch the Newcastle Road upon the west. At seven  in the morning all was ready for the assault.    Two military facts of importance had already been disclosed. One was  that the Boer percussion-shells were useless in soft ground, as hardly  any of them exploded; the other that the Boer guns could outrange our  ordinary fifteen-pounder field gun, which had been the one thing perhaps  in the whole British equipment upon which we were prepared to pin our  faith. The two batteries, the 13th and the 69th, were moved nearer,  first to 3000, and then at last to 2300 yards, at which range they  quickly dominated the guns upon the hill. Other guns had opened from  another crest to the east of Talana, but these also were mastered by the  fire of the 13th Battery. At 7.30 the infantry were ordered to advance,  which they did in open order, extended to ten paces. The Dublin  Fusiliers formed the first line, the Rifles the second, and the Irish  Fusiliers the third.    The first thousand yards of the advance were over open grassland, where  the range was long, and the yellow brown of the khaki blended with the  withered veld. There were few casualties until the wood was reached,  which lay halfway up the long slope of the hill. It was a plantation of  larches, some hundreds of yards across and nearly as many deep. On  the left side of this wood--that is, the left side to the advancing  troops--there stretched a long nullah or hollow, which ran  perpendicularly to the hill, and served rather as a conductor of bullets  than as a cover. So severe was the fire at this point that both in the  wood and in the nullah the troops lay down to avoid it. An officer of  Irish Fusiliers has narrated how in trying to cut the straps from a  fallen private a razor lent him for that purpose by a wounded sergeant  was instantly shot out of his hand. The gallant Symons, who had refused  to dismount, was shot through the stomach and fell from his horse  mortally wounded. With an excessive gallantry, he had not only attracted  the enemy's fire by retaining his horse, but he had been accompanied  throughout the action by an orderly bearing a red pennon. 'Have they got  the hill? Have they got the hill?' was his one eternal question as they  carried him dripping to the rear. It was at the edge of the wood that  Colonel Sherston met his end.    From now onwards it was as much a soldiers' battle as Inkermann. In the  shelter of the wood the more eager of the three battalions had pressed  to the front until the fringe of the trees was lined by men from all of  them. The difficulty of distinguishing particular regiments where all  were clad alike made it impossible in the heat of action to keep any  sort of formation. So hot was the fire that for the time the advance  was brought to a standstill, but the 69th battery, firing shrapnel at a  range of 1400 yards, subdued the rifle fire, and about half-past eleven  the infantry were able to push on once more.    Above the wood there was an open space some hundreds of yards across,  bounded by a rough stone wall built for herding cattle. A second wall  ran at right angles to this down towards the wood. An enfilading rifle  fire had been sweeping across this open space, but the wall in front  does not appear to have been occupied by the enemy, who held the kopje  above it. To avoid the cross fire the soldiers ran in single file under  the shelter of the wall, which covered them to the right, and so reached  the other wall across their front. Here there was a second long delay,  the men dribbling up from below, and firing over the top of the wall and  between the chinks of the stones. The Dublin Fusiliers, through being in  a more difficult position, had been unable to get up as quickly as the  others, and most of the hard-breathing excited men who crowded under the  wall were of the Rifles and of the Irish Fusiliers. The air was so full  of bullets that it seemed impossible to live upon the other side of this  shelter. Two hundred yards intervened between the wall and the crest of  the kopje. And yet the kopje had to be cleared if the battle were to be  won.    Out of the huddled line of crouching men an officer sprang shouting, and  a score of soldiers vaulted over the wall and followed at his heels.

His teeth were chattering so that he could hardly speak, but he gasped  out a story about seeing a monstrous head, a half mile across, he said,  with a long snake body stretching out over the sea until the end of it  was lost on the horizon. I turned my glass in the direction he pointed  and of course there was nothing to be seen. The man's condition was such  as to make him worse than useless as a lookout, so I relieved him and  ordered him below. I took it for a touch of delirium tremens.    \"We were bucking a head wind, although not a very stiff one, and we  didn't make port until after dark, so we anchored at quarantine, just  off Staten Island, in forty fathoms of water, and Captain Murphy radioed  for a Coast Guard boat to come out and lay by us for the night. As you  have probably heard, we were carrying four millions in bar gold  consigned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from the Bank of  England.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird and Carnes nodded. The inexplicable loss of the _Arethusa_ had  occupied much space in the papers ten days earlier.    \"The cutter came out, signalled, and dropped anchor about three hundred  yards away. So far, everything was exactly as it should be. I walked to  the stern of the boat and looked out across the Atlantic and then I  realized that Green wasn't the only one who could see things. The wind  had fallen and it was getting pretty dark, but not too dark to see  things a pretty good distance away. As I looked I saw, or thought I saw,  a huge black leathery mass come to the surface a mile or so away. There  were two things on it that looked like eyes, and I had a feeling as  though some malignant thing was staring at me. I rubbed my eyes and  looked again, but the vision persisted, and I went forward to get a  glass. When I came back the thing, whatever it was, had disappeared, but  the water where it had been was boiling as though there were a great  spring or something of the sort under the surface.    \"I trained my glass on the disturbed area, and I will take my oath  that I saw a huge body like a snake emerge from the water. It lay in  long undulations on the waves, and moved with them as though it were  floating. It was quite a bit nearer than the first thing had been and  I could see it plainly with the glass. I would judge it to be fifteen  or twenty feet thick, and it actually seemed to disappear in the  distance as Green had described it. The sight of the thing sent shivers  up and down my spine, and I gave a hoarse shout. The lookout hurried  to my side and asked me what the trouble was. I pointed and handed  him the glass. He looked through it and handed it back to me with a  curious expression.    \"'I can't see nothing, sir,' he said.    \"I took the glass from him and tried to level it but my hands were  trembling so that I was forced to rest it on the rail. The lookout was  right. There was absolutely nothing to be seen and the peculiar  appearance of the sea had subsided to normal. The lookout was staring at  me rather curiously and I knew that he was thinking the same thing about  me as I had thought about Green in the afternoon. I made some kind of an  excuse and went below to pull myself together. I caught a glimpse of  myself in the glass. I was as white as a sheet, and the sweat was  running off my face in drops.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I shook myself together after a fashion and managed to persuade myself  that the whole thing was just a trick of my mind, inspired by Green's  vivid description of his delirious vision of the afternoon. Eight bells  struck, and when Mr. Fulton, the junior officer, relieved me, I laid  down and tried to quiet myself. I didn't have much luck. Just before I  took the deck again at midnight I slipped down to the forecastle to see  how Green was coming along. He was lying in his bunk, wide awake, with  staring eyes.    \"'How are you feeling now, Green?' I asked.    \"He looked up at me with an expression of a man who has looked death in  the face.    \"'Ain't there no chance of dockin' to-night, Mr. Mitchell?' he asked.    \"'Of course not,' I said rather sharply. 'What's the matter with you?  Are you afraid your sea serpent will get us?'    \"'He'll get us if we stay out here to-night, sir,' he replied with an  air of conviction. 'I saw the horrible mouth on him, large enough to  bite this ship in half; and it had a beak like a bird, like a bloody  parrot, sir. I saw its horrible body, too, with great black ulcers on  the under side of it where the sharks had been after it. For all the  shark takes a man now and then, he's the seaman's friend, sir, because  he kills off the sea serpents who would take ship and all.'    \"'Nonsense, Green!' I said sharply. 'Don't talk any more such  foolishness or I'll have you ironed. You've been drinking so much that  you are seeing things, and I won't have the crew disturbed by your crazy  talk.'    \"'You won't think it's talk when those big eyes stare into yours  to-night, Mr. Mitchell, and that body twists around you and squeezes the  life out of you. I don't care whether you iron me or not; I know that  I'm doomed and so is everyone else; but I won't talk about it, sir. The  crew might as well rest easy while they can, for there's no escape if we  have to stay out here to-night.'    \"'Well, be sure you keep a tight mouth then,' I said, and left rather  hurriedly. I was in a cold sweat, for his air of conviction, together  with what I had seen, had shaken me pretty badly. I heard the watch  changing up above, and knew there would be men in the forecastle in a  minute. I didn't want to face them right then.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Mr. Fulton reported everything quiet when I went on deck to relieve  him, and although I surveyed the water through a night glass for as far  as I could see, there was nothing out of the way. The Coast Guard's  lights were shining less than a quarter of a mile away, and things  looked peaceful enough. The wind had gone down with the sun; the sea was  almost glassy, and there was a bright moon.    \"After going around the ship, I relieved all of the watch except two men  for lookouts, and sent them below to get a good night's sleep. If I  hadn't done that, some of them might be alive now.    \"I paced the deck for an hour trying to quiet my nerves, but really  getting more nervous every minute. Three bells struck and I walked  forward and leaned on the rail to watch the water. I saw a peculiar  swirl as though some large body were coming to the surface from below,  and then I saw--it.    \"Dr. Bird, I take a drink once in a while when I am on shore, but never  at sea and never in excess, and I know it wasn't a vision of drink  delirium. I felt perfectly normal aside from my nervousness, and I don't  think it was fever. Either I saw it or I am insane, for it is as vivid  to me as though I were standing on the _Arethusa's_ deck and that  monstrous horror was rising once more before my eyes.\"    The seaman's face had become drawn and white as he talked, and drops of  sweat were trickling from his chin. Carnes sat forward absorbed in his  narrative while Dr. Bird sat back with a glitter in his black eyes and  an expression of great attention on his face.    \"Go on, Mr. Mitchell,\" the doctor said soothingly. \"Tell me just what  you saw.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mitchell shuddered and glanced quickly around the laboratory as though  to assure himself that he was safe within four walls.    \"From the surface of the sea,\" he went on, \"rose a massive body, black,  and of the appearance of wet leather. It must have been a couple of  hundred yards across, although the size of objects is often magnified by  moonlight and my terror may have added to its size. In the midst of it  were two great discs, thirty feet across, which glowed red with the  reflected moonlight. It stared for a moment and then rose higher until  it towered above the ship; and then I saw, or thought I saw, a huge  gaping beak like a parrot's. It was as Green had described it, large  enough to bite the _Arethusa_ in half, and she was a ship of three  thousand tons.    \"I was frozen with horror and couldn't move or cry out. As I watched, I  saw the long snake-like body emerge from the water, and the estimate I  had made of the size in the afternoon seemed pitifully inadequate.  Presently a second and a third snake arose from the water, and then  more, until the whole sea and the air above it seemed a writhing mass of  huge snakes. I remember wondering why the watch of the Coast Guard  cutter didn't sound an alarm, and then I realized that the thing had  arisen on our port side and the cutter was on the starboard.    \"The mass of snakes writhed backward and forward, and then two of them  rose in the air and hung over the ship. I could see the under side and I  saw what Green had called the scars where the sharks had attacked. They  were great cup-shaped depressions with vile white edges, and they did  resemble huge sores or ulcers. They wavered over the ship for an  instant, and then both of them dropped down on the deck.    \"I found my voice and I think that I gave a yell, but even as I opened  my mouth, I realized the futility of it. The _Arethusa_ was sucked down  into the sea as though it had been a tiny chip. I saw the water rising  to the rail, and I think I cried out again. The ship tilted and I felt  myself falling. The next thing I knew was when I was in the hospital and  was told that I had been raving for a week. I was afraid to tell my  story for fear I would be put in an asylum, so I kept a tight tongue in  my head until I was discharged.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird mused for a moment as the seaman's voice stopped.    \"You cried out all right, Mr. Mitchell,\" he said. \"You gave two"]]]
