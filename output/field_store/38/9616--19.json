M. de Laubardemont tried  to prevent this test, by objecting to Duncan as an atheist, but as  Duncan was greatly respected on account of his skill and probity, there  was such an outcry at this interference from the entire audience that  the commissioner was forced to let him have his way. The six porters  were therefore dismissed, but instead of resuming their places among the  spectators they left the church by the sacristy, while Duncan  approaching the bed on which the superior had again lain down, seized  her by the wrist, and making certain that he had a firm hold, he told  the exorcists to begin.    Never up to that time had it been so clearly shown that the conflict  going on was between public opinion and the private aims of a few. A  hush fell on the church; everyone stood motionless in silent expectancy.    The moment Pere Lactance uttered the sacred words the convulsions of the  superior recommenced; but it seemed as if Duncan had more strength than  his six predecessors together, for twist and writhe and struggle as she  would, the superior's wrist remained none the less firmly clasped in  Duncan's hand. At length she fell back on her bed exhausted,  exclaiming!\"    \"It's no use, it's no use! He's holding me!\"    \"Release her arm!\" shouted Pere Lactance in a rage. \"How can the  convulsions take place if you hold her that way?\"    \"If she is really possessed by a demon,\" answered Duncan aloud, \"he  should be stronger than I; for it is stated in the ritual that among the  symptoms of possession is strength beyond one's years, beyond one's  condition, and beyond what is natural.\"    \"That is badly argued,\" said Lactance sharply: \"a demon outside the body  is indeed stronger than you, but when enclosed in a weak frame such as  this it cannot show such strength, for its efforts are proportioned to  the strength of the body it possesses.\"    \"Enough!\" said M. de Laubardemont; \"we did not come here to argue with  philosophers, but to build up the faith of Christians.\"    With that he rose up from his chair amidst a terrible uproar, and the  assembly dispersed in the utmost disorder, as if they were leaving a  theatre rather than a church.    The ill success of this exhibition caused a cessation of events of  interest for some days. The result was that a great number of noblemen  and other people of quality who had come to Loudun expecting to see  wonders and had been shown only commonplace transparent tricks, began to  think it was not worth while remaining any longer, and went their  several ways--a defection much bewailed by Pere Tranquille in a little  work which he published on this affair.    \"Many,\" he says, \"came to see miracles at Loudun, but finding the devils  did not give them the signs they expected, they went away dissatisfied,  and swelled the numbers of the unbelieving.\"    It was determined, therefore, in order to keep the town full, to predict  some great event which would revive curiosity and increase faith. Pere  Lactance therefore announced that on the 20th of May three of the seven  devils dwelling in the superior would come out, leaving three wounds in  her left side, with corresponding holes in her chemise, bodice, and  dress. The three parting devils were Asmodeus, Gresil des Trones, and  Aman des Puissances. He added that the superior's hands would be bound  behind her back at the time the wounds were given.    On the appointed day the church of Sainte-Croix was filled to  overflowing with sightseers curious to know if the devils would keep  their promises better this time than the last. Physicians were invited  to examine the superior's side and her clothes; and amongst those who  came forward was Duncan, whose presence guaranteed the public against  deception; but none of the exorcists ventured to exclude him, despite  the hatred in which they held him--a hatred which they would have made  him feel if he had not been under the special protection of Marshal  Breze. The physicians having completed their examination, gave the  following certificate:--    \"We have found no wound in the patient's side, no rent in her vestments,  and our search revealed no sharp instrument hidden in the folds of her  dress.\"    These preliminaries having been got through, Pere Lactance questioned  her in French for nearly two hours, her answers being in the same  language. Then he passed from questions to adjurations: on this, Duncan  came forward, and said a promise had been given that the superior's  hands should be tied behind her back, in order that there might be no  room for suspicion of fraud, and that the moment had now arrived to keep  that promise. Pere Lactance admitted the justice of the demand, but said  as there were many present who had never seen the superior in  convulsions such as afflicted the possessed, it would be only fair that  she should be exorcised for their satisfaction before binding her.  Accordingly he began to repeat the form of exorcism, and the superior  was immediately attacked by frightful convulsions, which in a few  minutes produced complete exhaustion, so that she fell on her face to  the ground, and turning on her left arm and side, remained motionless  some instants, after which she uttered a low cry, followed by a groan.  The physicians approached her, and Duncan seeing her take away her hand  from her left side, seized her arm, and found that the tips of her  fingers were stained with blood. They then examined her clothing and  body, and found her dress, bodice, and chemise cut through in three  places, the cuts being less than an inch long. There were also three  scratches beneath the left breast, so slight as to be scarcely more than  skin deep, the middle one being a barleycorn in length; still, from all  three a sufficient quantity of blood had oozed to stain the chemise  above them.    This time the fraud was so glaring that even de Laubardemont exhibited  some signs of confusion because of the number and quality of the  spectators. He would not, however, allow the doctors to include in their  report their opinion as to the manner in which the wounds were  inflicted; but Grandier protested against this in a Statement of Facts,  which he drew up during the night, and which was distributed next day.    It was as follows:    \"That if the superior had not groaned the physicians would not have  removed her clothes, and would have suffered her to be bound, without  having the least idea that the wounds were already made; that then the  exorcists would have commanded the devils to come forth, leaving the  traces they had promised; that the superior would then have gone through  the most extraordinary contortions of which she was capable, and have  had a long fit of, convulsions, at the end of which she would have been  delivered from the three demons, and the wounds would have been found in  her body; that her groans, which had betrayed her, had by God's will  thwarted the best-laid plans of men and devils. Why do you suppose,\" he  went on to ask, \"that clean incised wounds, such as a sharp blade would  make, 'were chosen for a token, seeing that the wounds left by devils  resemble burns? Was it not because it was easier for the superior to  conceal a lancet with which to wound herself slightly, than to conceal  any instrument sufficiently heated to burn her? Why do you think the  left side was chosen rather than the forehead and nose, if not because  she could not give herself a wound in either of those places without  being seen by all the spectators? Why was the left side rather than the  right chosen, if it were not that it was easier for the superior to  wound herself with her right hand, which she habitually used, in the  left side than in the right? Why did she turn on her left side and arm  and remain so long in that position, if it were not to hide from the  bystanders the instrument with which she wounded herself? What do you  think caused her to groan, in spite of all her resolution, if it were  not the pain of the wound she gave herself? for the most courageous  cannot repress a shudder when the surgeon opens a vein. Why were her  finger-tips stained with blood, if it were not that the secreted blade  was so small that the fingers which held it could not escape being  reddened by the blood it caused to flow? How came it that the wounds  were so superficial that they barely went deeper than the cuticle, while  devils are known to rend and tear demoniacs when leaving them, if it  were not that the superior did not hate herself enough to inflict deep  and dangerous wounds?\"    Despite this logical protest from Grandier and the barefaced knavery of  the exorcist, M. de Laubardemont prepared a report of the expulsion of  the three devils, Asmodeus, Gresil, and Aman, from the body of sister  Jeanne des Anges, through three wounds below the region of the heart; a  report which was afterwards shamelessly used against Grandier, and of  which the memorandum still exists, a monument, not so much of credulity  and superstition, as of hatred and revenge. Pere Lactance, in order to  allay the suspicions which the pretended miracle had aroused among the  eye-wittnesses, asked Balaam, one of the four demons who still remained  in the superior's body, the following day, why Asmodeus and his two  companions had gone out against their promise, while the superior's face  and hands were hidden from the people.    \"To lengthen the incredulity of certain people,\" answered Balaam.    As for Pere Tranquille, he published a little volume describing the  whole affair, in which, with the irresponsible frivolity of a true  Capuchin, he poked fun at those who could not swallow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#16)"],[1,"probably nothing to say which cannot be said  before you.\"    Derues entered the room, and, after the usual compliments, sat down by  the fire, opposite Monsieur de Lamotte.    \"You did not expect me,\" he said, \"and I ought to apologise for  surprising you thus.\"    \"Give me some news of my wife,\" asked Monsieur de Lamotte anxiously.    \"She has never been better. Your son is also to perfect health.\"    \"But why are you alone? Why does not Marie accompany you? It is ten  weeks since she went to Paris.\"    \"She has not yet quite finished the business with which you entrusted  her. Perhaps I am partly the cause of this long absence, but one cannot  transact business as quickly as one would wish. But, you have no doubt  heard from her, that all is finished, or nearly so, between us. We have  drawn up a second private contract, which annuls the former agreement,  and I have paid over a sum of one hundred thousand livres.\"    \"I do not comprehend,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte. \"What can induce my  wife not to inform me of this?\"    \"You did not know?\"    \"I know nothing. I was wondering just now with Monsieur le cure why I  did not hear from her.\"    \"Madame de Lamotte was going to write to you, and I do not know what can  have hindered her.\"    \"When did you leave her?\"    \"Several days ago. I have not been at Paris; I am returning from  Chartres. I believed you were informed of everything.\"    Monsieur de Lamotte remained silent for some moments. Then, fixing his  eyes upon Derues' immovable countenance, he said, with some emotion--    \"You are a husband and father, sir; in the name of this double and  sacred affection which is, not unknown to you, do not hide anything from  me: I fear some misfortune has happened to my wife which you are  concealing.\"    Derues' physiognomy expressed nothing but a perfectly natural  astonishment.    \"What can have suggested such ideas to you; dear sir?\" In saying this he  glanced at the cure; wishing to ascertain if this distrust was Monsieur  de Lamotte's own idea, or had been suggested to him. The movement was so  rapid that neither of the others observed it. Like all knaves, obliged  by their actions to be continually on the watch, Derues possessed to a  remarkable extent the art of seeing all round him without appearing to  observe anything in particular. He decided that as yet he had only to  combat a suspicion unfounded on proof, and he waited till he should be  attacked more seriously.    \"I do not know,\" he said, \"what may have happened during my absence;  pray explain yourself, for you are making me share your disquietude.\"    \"Yes, I am exceedingly anxious; I entreat you, tell me the whole truth.  Explain this silence, and this absence prolonged beyond all expectation.  You finished your business with Madame de Lamotte several days ago: once  again, why did she not write? There is no letter, either from her or my  son! To-morrow I shall send someone to Paris.\"    \"Good heavens!\" answered Derues, \"is there nothing but an accident which  could cause this delay? . . . Well, then,\" he continued, with the  embarrassed look of a man compelled to betray a confidence,--\"well,  then, I see that in order to reassure you, I shall have to give up a  secret entrusted to me.\"    He then told Monsieur de Lamotte that his wife was no longer at Paris,  but at Versailles, where she was endeavouring to obtain an important and  lucrative appointment, and that, if she had left him in ignorance of her  efforts in this direction; it was only to give him an agreeable  surprise. He added that she had removed her son from the school, and  hoped to place him either in the riding school or amongst the royal  pages. To prove his words, he opened his paper-case, and produced the  letter written by Edouard in answer to the one quoted above.    All this was related so simply, and with such an appearance of good  faith, that the cure was quite convinced. And to Monsieur de Lamotte the  plans attributed to his wife were not entirely improbably. Derues had  learnt indirectly that such a career for Edouard had been actually under  consideration. However, though Monsieur de Lamotte's entire ignorance  prevented him from making any serious objection, his fears were not  entirely at rest, but for the present he appeared satisfied with the  explanation.    The cure resumed the conversation. \"What you tell us ought to drive away  gloomy ideas. Just now, when you were announced, Monsieur de Lamotte was  confiding his troubles to me. I was as concerned as he was, and I could  say nothing to help him; never did visitor arrive more apropos. Well, my  friend, what now remains of your vain terrors? What was it you were  saying just as Monsieur Derues arrived? . . . Ah! we were discussing  dreams, you asked if I believed in them.\"    Monsieur, de Lamotte, who had sunk back in his easy-chair and seemed  lost in his reflections, started on hearing these words. He raised his  head and looked again at Derues. But the latter had had time to note the  impression produced by the cure's remark, and this renewed examination  did not disturb him.    \"Yes,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I had asked that question.\"    \"And I was going to answer that there are certain secret warnings which  can be received by the soul long before they are intelligible to the  bodily senses-revelations not understood at first, but which later  connect themselves with realities of which they are in some way the  precursors. Do you agree with me, Monsieur Derues?\"    \"I have no opinion on such a subject, and must leave the discussion to  more learned people than myself. I do not know whether such apparitions  really mean anything or not, and I have not sought to fathom these  mysteries, thinking them outside the realm of human intelligence.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said the cure, \"we are obliged to recognise their  existence.\"    \"Yes, but without either understanding or explaining them, like many  other eternal truths. I follow the rule given in the Imitation o f Jesus  Christ: 'Beware, my son, of considering too curiously the things beyond  thine intelligence.'\"    \"And I also submit, and avoid too curious consideration. But has not the  soul knowledge of many wondrous things which we can yet neither see nor  touch? I repeat, there are things which cannot be denied.\"    Derues listened attentively, continually on his guard; and afraid, he  knew not why, of becoming entangled in this conversation, as in a trap.  He carefully watched Monsieur de Lamotte, whose eyes never left him. The  cure resumed--    \"Here is an instance which I was bound to accept, seeing it happened to  myself. I was then twenty, and my mother lived in the neighbourhood of  Tours, whilst I was at the seminary of Montpellier. After several years  of separation, I had obtained permission to go and see her. I wrote,  telling her of this good news, and I received her answer--full of joy  and tenderness. My brother and sister were to be informed, it was to be  a family meeting, a real festivity; and I started with a light and  joyous heart. My impatience was so great, that, having stopped for  supper at a village inn some ten leagues from Tours, I would not wait  till the next morning for the coach which went that way, but continued  the journey on foot and walked all night. It was a long and difficult  road, but happiness redoubled my strength. About an hour after sunrise I  saw distinctly the smoke and the village roofs, and I hurried on to  surprise my family a little sooner. I never felt more active, more  light-hearted and gay; everything seemed to smile before and around me.  Turning a corner of the hedge, I met a peasant whom I recognised. All at  once it seemed as if a veil spread over my sight, all my hopes and joy  suddenly vanished, a funereal idea took possession of me, and I said,  taking the hand of the man, who had not yet spoken--    \"'My mother is dead, I am convinced my mother is dead!'    \"He hung down his head and answered--    \"'She is to be buried this morning!'    \"Now whence came this revelation? I had seen no one, spoken to no one; a  moment before I had no idea of it!\"    Derues made a gesture of surprise. Monsieur de Lamotte put his hand to  his eyes, and said to the cure--    \"Your presentiments were true; mine, happily, are unfounded. But listen,  and tell me if in the state of anxiety which oppressed me I had not good  reason for alarm and for fearing some fatal misfortune.\"    His eyes again sought Derues. \"Towards the middle of last night I at  length fell asleep, but, interrupted every moment, this sleep was more a  fatigue than a rest; I seemed to hear confused noises all round me. I  saw brilliant lights which dazzled me, and then sank back into silence  and darkness. Sometimes I heard someone weeping near my bed; again  plaintive voices called to me out of the darkness. I stretched out my  arms, but nothing met them, I fought with phantoms; at length a cold  hand grasped mine and led me rapidly forward. Under a dark and damp  vault a woman lay on the ground, bleeding, inanimate--it was my wife! At  the same moment, a groan made me look round, and I beheld a man striking  my son with a dagger. I cried out and awoke, bathed in cold  perspiration, panting under this terrible vision. I was obliged to get  up, walk about, and speak aloud, in order to convince myself it was only  a dream. I tried to go to sleep again, but the same visions still  pursued me. I saw always the same man armed with two daggers streaming  with blood; I heard always the cries of his two victims. When day came,  I felt utterly broken, worn-out; and this morning, you, my father, could  see by my despondency what an impression this awful night had made upon  me.\"    During this recital Derues' calmness never gave way for a single moment,  and the most skilful physiognomist could only have discovered an  expression of incredulous curiosity on his countenance.    \"Monsieur le cure's"]]]
