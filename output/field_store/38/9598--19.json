[86]    It was indeed necessary that he should bestir himself; for, a few days  after his arrival, he learned that, on the other side of the Pale,  all was ready for action. The greater part of the English force was  collected, before the close of May, in the neighbourhood of Mullingar.  Ginkell commanded in chief. He had under him the two best officers,  after Marlborough, of whom our island could then boast, Talmash and  Mackay. The Marquess of Ruvigny, the hereditary chief of the refugees,  and elder brother of the brave Caillemot, who had fallen at the Boyne,  had joined the army with the rank of major general. The Lord Justice  Coningsby, though not by profession a soldier, came down from Dublin, to  animate the zeal of the troops. The appearance of the camp showed that  the money voted by the English Parliament had not been spared. The  uniforms were new; the ranks were one blaze of scarlet; and the train of  artillery was such as had never before been seen in Ireland. [87]    On the sixth of June Ginkell moved his head quarters from Mullingar. On  the seventh he reached Ballymore. At Ballymore, on a peninsula almost  surrounded by something between a swamp and a lake, stood an ancient  fortress, which had recently been fortified under Sarsfield's direction,  and which was defended by above a thousand men. The English guns were  instantly planted. In a few hours the besiegers had the satisfaction of  seeing the besieged running like rabbits from one shelter to another.  The governor, who had at first held high language, begged piteously for  quarter, and obtained it. The whole garrison were marched off to Dublin.  Only eight of the conquerors had fallen. [88]    Ginkell passed some days in reconstructing the defences of Ballymore.  This work had scarcely been performed when he was joined by the Danish  auxiliaries under the command of the Duke of Wirtemberg. The whole army  then moved westward, and, on the nineteenth of June, appeared before the  walls of Athlone. [89]    Athlone was perhaps, in a military point of view, the most important  place in the island. Rosen, who understood war well, had always  maintained that it was there that the Irishry would, with most  advantage, make a stand against the Englishry. [90] The town, which was  surrounded by ramparts of earth, lay partly in Leinster and partly  in Connaught. The English quarter, which was in Leinster, had once  consisted of new and handsome houses, but had been burned by the Irish  some months before, and now lay in heaps of ruin. The Celtic quarter,  which was in Connaught, was old and meanly built. [91] The Shannon,  which is the boundary of the two provinces, rushed through Athlone in  a deep and rapid stream, and turned two large mills which rose on the  arches of a stone bridge. Above the bridge, on the Connaught side,  a castle, built, it was said, by King John, towered to the height of  seventy feet, and extended two hundred feet along the river. Fifty or  sixty yards below the bridge was a narrow ford. [92]    During the night of the nineteenth the English placed their cannon. On  the morning of the twentieth the firing began. At five in the afternoon  an assault was made. A brave French refugee with a grenade in his hand  was the first to climb the breach, and fell, cheering his countrymen to  the onset with his latest breath. Such were the gallant spirits which  the bigotry of Lewis had sent to recruit, in the time of his utmost  need, the armies of his deadliest enemies. The example was not lost. The  grenades fell thick. The assailants mounted by hundreds. The Irish gave  way and ran towards the bridge. There the press was so great that some  of the fugitives were crushed to death in the narrow passage, and others  were forced over the parapets into the waters which roared among the  mill wheels below. In a few hours Ginkell had made himself master of the  English quarter of Athlone; and this success had cost him only twenty  men killed and forty wounded. [93]    But his work was only begun. Between him and the Irish town the Shannon  ran fiercely. The bridge was so narrow that a few resolute men might  keep it against an army. The mills which stood on it were strongly  guarded; and it was commanded by the guns of the castle. That part of  the Connaught shore where the river was fordable was defended by works,  which the Lord Lieutenant had, in spite of the murmurs of a powerful  party, forced Saint Ruth to entrust to the care of Maxwell. Maxwell had  come back from France a more unpopular man than he had been when he  went thither. It was rumoured that he had, at Versailles, spoken  opprobriously of the Irish nation; and he had, on this account, been,  only a few days before, publicly affronted by Sarsfield. [94] On the  twenty-first of June the English were busied in flinging up batteries  along the Leinster bank. On the twenty-second, soon after dawn, the  cannonade began. The firing continued all that day and all the following  night. When morning broke again, one whole side of the castle had been  beaten down; the thatched lanes of the Celtic town lay in ashes; and one  of the mills had been burned with sixty soldiers who defended it. [95]    Still however the Irish defended the bridge resolutely. During several  days there was sharp fighting hand to hand in the strait passage. The  assailants gained ground, but gained it inch by inch. The courage of the  garrison was sustained by the hope of speedy succour. Saint Ruth had at  length completed his preparations; and the tidings that Athlone was  in danger had induced him to take the field in haste at the head of an  army, superior in number, though inferior in more important elements of  military strength, to the army of Ginkell. The French general seems to  have thought that the bridge and the ford might easily be defended, till  the autumnal rains and the pestilence which ordinarily accompanied them  should compel the enemy to retire. He therefore contented himself with  sending successive detachments to reinforce the garrison. The immediate  conduct of the defence he entrusted to his second in command, D'Usson,  and fixed his own head quarters two or three miles from the town. He  expressed his astonishment that so experienced a commander as Ginkell  should persist in a hopeless enterprise. \"His master ought to hang him  for trying to take Athlone; and mine ought to hang me if I lose it.\"  [96]    Saint Ruth, however, was by no means at ease. He had found, to his great  mortification, that he had not the full authority which the promises  made to him at Saint Germains had entitled him to expect. The Lord  Lieutenant was in the camp. His bodily and mental infirmities had  perceptibly increased within the last few weeks. The slow and uncertain  step with which he, who had once been renowned for vigour and agility,  now tottered from his easy chair to his couch, was no unapt type of the  sluggish and wavering movement of that mind which had once pursued its  objects with a vehemence restrained neither by fear nor by pity, neither  by conscience nor by shame. Yet, with impaired strength, both physical  and intellectual, the broken old man clung pertinaciously to power. If  he had received private orders not to meddle with the conduct of the  war, he disregarded them. He assumed all the authority of a sovereign,  showed himself ostentatiously to the troops as their supreme chief, and  affected to treat Saint Ruth as a lieutenant. Soon the interference of  the Viceroy excited the vehement indignation of that powerful party in  the army which had long hated him. Many officers signed an instrument by  which they declared that they did not consider him as entitled to their  obedience in the field. Some of them offered him gross personal insults.  He was told to his face that, if he persisted in remaining where he was  not wanted, the ropes of his pavilion should be cut. He, on the other  hand, sent his emissaries to all the camp fires, and tried to make a  party among the common soldiers against the French general. [97]    The only thing in which Tyrconnel and Saint Ruth agreed was in dreading  and disliking Sarsfield. Not only was he popular with the great body  of his countrymen; he was also surrounded by a knot of retainers whose  devotion to him resembled the devotion of the Ismailite murderers to  the Old Man of the Mountain. It was known that one of these fanatics, a  colonel, had used language which, in the mouth of an officer so high in  rank, might well cause uneasiness. \"The King,\" this man had said, \"is  nothing to me. I obey Sarsfield. Let Sarsfield tell me to kill any  man in the whole army; and I will do it.\" Sarsfield was, indeed, too  honourable a gentleman to abuse his immense power over the minds of  his worshippers. But the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief might not  unnaturally be disturbed by the thought that Sarsfield's honour was  their only guarantee against mutiny and assassination. The consequence  was that, at the crisis of the fate of Ireland, the services of the  first of Irish soldiers were not used, or were used with jealous  caution, and that, if he ventured to offer a suggestion, it was received  with a sneer or a frown. [98]    A great and unexpected disaster put an end to these disputes. On the  thirtieth of June Ginkell called a council of war. Forage began to be  scarce; and it was absolutely necessary that the besiegers should either  force their way across the river or retreat. The difficulty of effecting  a passage over the shattered remains of the bridge seemed almost  insuperable. It was proposed to try the ford. The Duke of Wirtemberg,  Talmash, and Ruvigny gave their voices in favour of this plan; and  Ginkell, with some misgivings, consented. [99]    It was determined that the attempt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#16)"],[1,"to mislead the  bystander; and hence the most ingenious discoverers become so  pertinaciously deluded as to lose eye and ear for those less obvious  indications of general tone of style, color of incident, and form of  fable, on which more phlegmatic persons base measurement and comparison.  Whatever of truth there may or may not be generally in the above  remarks,--certain it is, that in the novels now in question instinct or  divination directed us aright. In the prefaces and notices before us, we  find that the Bells were three sisters:--two of whom are no longer  amongst the living. The survivor describes their home as--         \"A village parsonage, amongst the hills bordering Yorkshire       and Lancashire. The scenery of these hills is not grand--it       is not romantic; it is scarcely striking. Long low moors,       dark with heath, shut in little valleys, where a stream       waters, here and there, a fringe of stunted copse. Mills and       scattered cottages chase romance from these valleys; it is       only higher up, deep in amongst the ridges of the moors,       that Imagination can find rest for the sole of her foot: and       even if she finds it there, she must be a solitude-loving       raven,--no gentle dove. If she demand beauty to inspire her,       she must bring it inborn: these moors are too stern to yield       any product so delicate. The eye of the gazer must itself       brim with a 'purple light,' intense enough to perpetuate the       brief flower-flush of August on the heather, or the rare       sunset-smile of June; out of his heart must well the       freshness that in later spring and early summer brightens       the bracken, nurtures the moss, and cherishes the starry       flowers that spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the       moor-sheep. Unless that light and freshness are innate and       self-sustained, the drear prospect of a Yorkshire moor will       be found as barren of poetic as of agricultural interest:       where the love of wild nature is strong, the locality will       perhaps be clung to with the more passionate constancy,       because from the hill-lover's self comes half its charm.\"    Thus much of the scene:--now as to the story of the authorship of these  singular books:--         \"About five years ago, my two sisters and myself, after a       somewhat prolonged period of separation, found ourselves       reunited and at home. Resident in a remote district where       education had made little progress, and where, consequently,       there was no inducement to seek social intercourse beyond       our own domestic circle, we were wholly dependent on       ourselves and each other, on books and study, for the       enjoyments and occupations of life. * * One day, in the       autumn of 1845, I accidentally lighted on a MS. volume of       verse in my sister Emily's handwriting. Of course, I was not       surprised, knowing that she could and did write verse; I       looked it over, and something more than surprise seized       me,--a deep conviction that these were not common effusions,       nor at all like the poetry women generally write. * *       Meantime, my younger sister quietly produced some of her own       compositions, intimating that since Emily's had given me       pleasure, I might like to look at hers. I could not be a       partial judge, yet I thought that these verses too had a       sweet sincere pathos of their own. We had very early       cherished the dream of one day becoming authors. This dream,       never relinquished even when distance divided and absorbing       tasks occupied us, now suddenly acquired strength and       consistency: it took the character of a resolve. We agreed       to arrange a small selection of our poems, and, if possible,       get them printed. Averse to personal publicity, we veiled       our own names under those of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell;       the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of       conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively       masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women,       because--without at that time suspecting that our mode of       writing and thinking was not what is called 'feminine'--we       had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be       looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics       sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of       personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not       true praise. The bringing out of our little book was hard       work. * * Ill-success failed to crush us: the mere effort to       succeed had given a wonderful zest to existence; it must be       pursued. We each set to work on a prose tale: Ellis Bell       produced 'Wuthering Heights,' Acton Bell 'Agnes Grey,' and       Currer Bell also wrote a narrative in one volume. These MSS.       were perseveringly obtruded upon various publishers for the       space of a year and a half; usually, their fate was an       ignominious and abrupt dismissal. At last 'Wuthering       Heights' and 'Agnes Grey,' were accepted on terms somewhat       impoverishing to the two authors.\"    The MS. of a one-volume tale by Currer Bell had been thought by Messrs.  Smith & Elder so full of promise, that its writer was asked for a longer  story in a more saleable form.--         \"I was then just completing 'Jane Eyre,' at which I had been       working while the one-volume tale was plodding its weary       round in London: in three weeks I sent it off; friendly and       skillful hands took it in. This was in the commencement of       September, 1847; it came out before the close of October       following, while 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Agnes Grey,' my       sisters' works, which had already been in the press for       months, still lingered under a different management. They       appeared at last. Critics failed to do them justice.\"    The narrative may be best concluded in the writer's own words.         \"Neither Ellis nor Acton allowed herself for one moment to       sink under want of encouragement; energy nerved the one, and       endurance upheld the other. They were both prepared to try       again; I would fain think that hope and the sense of power       was yet strong within them. But a great change approached:       affliction came in that shape which to anticipate, is dread;       to look back on, grief. In the very heat and burden of the       day, the laborers failed over their work. My sister Emily       first declined. The details of her illness are deep-branded       in my memory, but to dwell on them, either in thought or       narrative, is not in my power. Never in all her life had she       lingered over any task that lay before her, and she did not       linger now. She sank rapidly. She made haste to leave us.       Yet, while physically she perished, mentally she grew       stronger than we had yet known her. Day by day, when I saw       with what a front she met suffering, I looked on her with an       anguish of wonder and love. I have seen nothing like it;       but, indeed, I have never seen her parallel in any thing.       Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood       alone. The awful point was, that, while full of ruth for       others, on herself she had no pity; the spirit was       inexorable to the flesh; from the trembling hand, the       unnerved limbs, the faded eyes, the same service was exacted       as they had rendered in health. To stand by and witness       this, and not dare to remonstrate, was a pain no words can       render. Two cruel months of hope and fear passed painfully       by, and the day came at last when the terrors and pains of       death were to be undergone by this treasure, which had grown       dearer and dearer to our hearts as it wasted before our       eyes. Towards the decline of that day, we had nothing of       Emily but her mortal remains as consumption left them. She       died December 19, 1848. We thought this enough; but we were       utterly and presumptuously wrong. She was not buried ere       Anne fell ill. She had not been committed to the grave a       fortnight, before we received distinct intimation that it       was necessary to prepare our minds to see the younger sister       go after the elder. Accordingly, she followed in the same       path with slower step, and with a patience that equalled the       other's fortitude. I have said that she was religious, and       it was by leaning on those Christian doctrines in which she       firmly believed that she found support through her most       painful journey. I witnessed their efficacy in her latest       hour and greatest trial, and must bear my testimony to the       calm triumph with which they brought her through. She died       May 28, 1849. What more shall I say about them? I cannot and       need not say much more. In externals, they were two       unobtrusive women; a perfectly secluded life gave them       retiring manners and habits.\"    Though the above particulars be little more than the filling-up of an  outline already clearly traced and constantly present whenever those  characteristic tales recurred to us,--by those who have held other ideas  with regard to the authorship of \"Jane Eyre\" they will be found at once  curious and interesting from the plain and earnest sincerity of the  writer. She subsequently enters on an analysis and discussion of  \"Wuthering Heights\" as a work of art;--in the closing paragraph of her  preface to that novel, insinuating an argument, if not a defence, the  urgency of which is not sufficiently admitted by the bulk of the world  of readers. Speaking of the fiendlike hero of her sister's work, she  says:--         \"Whether it is right or advisable to create beings like       Heathcliff, I do not know: I scarcely think it is. But this       I know; the writer who possesses the creative gift owns"]]]
