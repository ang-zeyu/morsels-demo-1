At the end of  a terrible scene which took place in public, Ali drove the confidant of  his crimes from the palace, overwhelming him with insults, and declaring  that were Athanasius not the son of his children's foster-mother, he  would have sent him to the gibbet. He enforced his words by the  application of a stick, and Vaya, apparently overwhelmed by terror and  affliction, went round to all the nobles of the town, vainly entreating  them to intercede for him. The only favour which Mouktar Pacha could  obtain for him was a sentence of exile allowing him to retreat to  Macedonia.    Athanasius departed from Janina with all the demonstrations of utter  despair, and continued his route with the haste of one who fears  pursuit. Arrived in Macedonia, he assumed the habit of a monk, and  undertook a pilgrimage to Mount Athos, saying that both the disguise and  the journey were necessary to his safety. On the way he encountered one  of the itinerant friars of the great Servian convent, to whom he  described his disgrace in energetic terms, begging him to obtain his  admission among the lay brethren of his monastery.    Delighted at the prospect of bringing back to the fold of the Church a  man so notorious for his crimes, the friar hastened to inform his  superior, who in his turn lost no time in announcing to Pacho Bey that  his compatriot and companion in misfortune was to be received among the  lay brethren, and in relating the history of Athanasius as he himself  had heard it. Pacho Bey, however, was not easily deceived, and at once  guessing that Vaya's real object was his own assassination, told his  doubts to the superior, who had already received him as a friend. The  latter retarded the reception of Vaya so as to give Pacho time to escape  and take the road to Constantinople. Once arrived there, he determined  to brave the storm and encounter Ali openly.    Endowed by nature with a noble presence and with masculine firmness,  Pacho Bey possessed also the valuable gift of speaking all the various  tongues of the Ottoman Empire. He could not fail to distinguish himself  in the capital and to find an opening for his great talents. But his  inclination drove him at first to seek his fellow-exiles from Epirus,  who were either his old companions in arms, friends, of relations, for  he was allied to all the principal families, and was even, through his  wife, nearly connected with his enemy, Ali Pacha himself.    He had learnt what this unfortunate lady had already endured on his  account, and feared that she would suffer yet more if he took active  measures against the pacha. While he yet hesitated between affection and  revenge, he heard that she had died of grief and misery. Now that  despair had put an end to uncertainty, he set his hand to the work.    At this precise moment Heaven sent him a friend to console and aid him  in his vengeance, a Christian from OEtolia, Paleopoulo by name. This man  was on the point of establishing himself in Russian Bessarabia, when he  met Pacho Bey and joined with him in the singular coalition which was to  change the fate of the Tepelenian dynasty.    Paleopoulo reminded his companion in misfortune of a memorial presented  to the Divan in 1812, which had brought upon Ali a disgrace from which  he only escaped in consequence of the overwhelming political events  which just then absorbed the attention of the Ottoman Government. The  Grand Seigneur had sworn by the tombs of his ancestors to attend to the  matter as soon as he was able, and it was only requisite to remind him  of his vow. Pacho Hey and his friend drew up a new memorial, and knowing  the sultan's avarice, took care to dwell on the immense wealth possessed  by Ali, on his scandalous exactions, and on the enormous sums diverted  from the Imperial Treasury. By overhauling the accounts of his  administration, millions might be recovered. To these financial  considerations Pacho Bey added some practical ones. Speaking as a man  sure of his facts and well acquainted with the ground, he pledged his  head that with twenty thousand men he would, in spite of Ali's troops  and strongholds, arrive before Janina without firing a musket.    However good these plans appeared, they were by no means to the taste of  the sultan's ministers, who were each and all in receipt of large  pensions from the man at whom they struck. Besides, as in Turkey it is  customary for the great fortunes of Government officials to be absorbed  on their death by the Imperial Treasury, it of course appeared easier to  await the natural inheritance of Ali's treasures than to attempt to  seize them by a war which would certainly absorb part of them.  Therefore, while Pacho Bey's zeal was commended, he obtained only  dilatory answers, followed at length by a formal refusal.    Meanwhile, the old OEtolian, Paleopoulo, died, having prophesied the  approaching Greek insurrection among his friends, and pledged Pacho Bey  to persevere in his plans of vengeance, assuring him that before long  Ali would certainly fall a victim to them. Thus left alone, Pacho,  before taking any active steps in his work of vengeance, affected to  give himself up to the strictest observances of the Mohammedan religion.  Ali, who had established a most minute surveillance over his actions,  finding that his time was spent with ulemas and dervishes, imagined that  he had ceased to be dangerous, and took no further trouble about him.          CHAPTER VIII      A career of successful crime had established Ali's rule over a  population equal to that of the two kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. But  his ambition was not yet satisfied. The occupation of Parga did not  crown his desires, and the delight which it caused him was much tempered  by the escape of the Parganiotes, who found in exile a safe refuge from  his persecution. Scarcely had he finished the conquest of Middle Albania  before he was exciting a faction against the young Moustai Pacha in  Scodra, a new object of greed. He also kept an army of spies in  Wallachia, Moldavia, Thrace, and Macedonia, and, thanks to them, he  appeared to be everywhere present, and was mixed up in every intrigue,  private or political, throughout the empire. He had paid the English  agents the price agreed on for Parga, but he repaid himself five times  over, by gifts extorted from his vassals, and by the value of the Parga  lands, now become his property. His palace of Tepelen had been rebuilt  at the public expense, and was larger and more magnificent than before;  Janina was embellished with new buildings; elegant pavilions rose on the  shores of the lake; in short, Ali's luxury was on a level with his vast  riches. His sons and grandsons were provided for by important positions,  and Ali himself was sovereign prince in everything but the name.    There was no lack of flattery, even from literary persons. At Vienna a  poem was pointed in his honour, and a French-Greek Grammar was dedicated  to him, and such titles as \"Most Illustrious,\" \"Most Powerful,\" and  \"Most Clement,\" were showered upon him, as upon a man whose lofty  virtues and great exploits echoed through the world. A native of  Bergamo, learned in heraldry, provided him with a coat of arms,  representing, on a field gules, a lion, embracing three cubs, emblematic  of the Tepelenian dynasty. Already he had a consul at Leucadia accepted  by the English, who, it is said, encouraged him to declare himself  hereditary Prince of Greece, under the nominal suzerainty of the sultan;  their real intention being to use him as a tool in return for their  protection, and to employ him as a political counter-balance to the  hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia, who for the last twenty years had  been simply Russian agents in disguise, This was not all; many of the  adventurers with whom the Levant swarms, outlaws from every country, had  found a refuge in Albania, and helped not a little to excite Ali's  ambition by their suggestions. Some of these men frequently saluted him  as King, a title which he affected to reject with indignation; and he  disdained to imitate other states by raising a private standard of his  own, preferring not to compromise his real power by puerile displays of  dignity; and he lamented the foolish ambition of his children, who would  ruin him, he said, by aiming, each, at becoming a vizier. Therefore he  did not place his hope or confidence in them, but in the adventurers of  every sort and kind, pirates, coiners, renegades, assassins, whom he  kept in his pay and regarded as his best support. These he sought to  attach to his person as men who might some day be found useful, for he  did not allow the many favours of fortune to blind him to the real  danger of his position. A vizier,\" he was answered, \"resembles a man  wrapped in costly furs, but he sits on a barrel of powder, which only  requires a spark to explode it.\" The Divan granted all the concessions  which Ali demanded, affecting ignorance of his projects of revolt and  his intelligence with the enemies of the State; but then apparent  weakness was merely prudent temporising. It was considered that Ali,  already advanced in years, could not live much longer, and it was hoped  that, at his death, Continental Greece, now in some measure detached  from the Ottoman rule, would again fall under the sultan's sway.    Meanwhile, Pacho Bey, bent on silently undermining Ali's influence; had  established himself as an intermediary for all those who came to demand  justice on account of the pacha's exactions, and he contrived that both  his own complaints and those of his clients, should penetrate to the  ears of the sultan; who, pitying his misfortunes, made him a  kapidgi-bachi, as a commencement of better things. About this time the  sultan also admitted to the Council a certain Abdi Effendi of Larissa,  one of the richest nobles of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1,"m: 4 (2002)    1,524 to 2,437 m: 1    over 3,047 m: 1    Heliports:    1 (2002)    Military Albania      Military branches:    Army, Navy, Air and Air Defense Forces, Interior Ministry Troops,    Border Guards    Military manpower - military age:    19 years of age (2003 est.)

The surprising first round success of the fundamentalist FIS    (Islamic Salvation Front) party in the December 1991 balloting    caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and postpone    the subsequent elections. The fundamentalist response has resulted    in a continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state    apparatus, which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring    pro-government and moderate religious-based parties. The FIS's armed    wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000 and many    armed militants of other groups surrendered under an amnesty program    designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless, small    numbers of armed militants persist in confronting government forces    and carrying out isolated attacks on villages and other types of    terrorist attacks. Other concerns include Berber unrest, large-scale    unemployment, a shortage of housing, and the need to diversify the    petroleum-based economy.
