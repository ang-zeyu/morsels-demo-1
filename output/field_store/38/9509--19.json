[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#16)"],[1,"of the shrine a  gilded crescent was fixed in the roof, which still remains; the origin and  meaning of this emblem have been disputed with considerable heat, and many  ingenious conjectures have been framed to account for its presence here.  One theory regards it as an allusion to the tradition according to which  Becket's mother was a Saracen. But this legend is believed to be  comparatively modern, and, as Mr. George Austin points out, \"even if the  legend of Becket's mother had obtained credence at that early period, it  may be observed that in the painted windows around no reference is made  to the subject, though evidently capable of so much pictorial effect.\"  Another solution would connect the crescent with the worship of the Virgin  Mary, who is often pictured as standing on the moon (comp. Rev. xii. 1).  Supporters of this theory lay stress on the fact that the Trinity Chapel  at Canterbury occupies the extreme east end of the church, which is  generally the site of the Lady Chapel, and that therefore the presence of  this emblem--if it can be connected with the Virgin--would be peculiarly  appropriate here. Mr. Austin propounded the explanation which is now most  generally accepted. \"When the groined roof,\" he says, \"was relieved of the  long-accumulated coats of whitewash and repaired, the crescent was taken  down and regilt. It was found to be made of a foreign wood, somewhat like  in grain to the eastern wood known by the name of iron-wood. It had been  fastened to the groining by a large nail of very singular shape, with a  large square head, apparently of foreign manufacture.\" He comes to the  conclusion that the crescent is one of a number of trophies which he  supposes to have once decorated this part of the cathedral, and he is  led to his conclusion by the fact that \"more than one fresco painting of  encounters with the Eastern infidels formerly ornamented the walls (the  last traces of which were removed during the restoration of the cathedral  under Dean Percy, afterwards Bishop of Carlisle), and in one of which the  green crescent flag of the enemy seems borne away by the English archers.  Might not these frescoes have depicted the fights in which these trophies  were won?\" Also, in the hollows of the groining which radiate from the  crescent, there were a number of slight iron staples, which Mr. Austin,  having shown that they cannot have supported either hanging lamps or the  covering of the shrine, believes to have upheld flags, horsetails, etc.,  which formed the trophy of which the gilded crescent was the centre. We  know that Becket received the title of St. Thomas Acrensis owing to his  close connection with the knights of the Hospital of St. John at Acre. But  none of these explanations seem very convincing, and the history and  significance of the crescent in the roof seem likely to remain a mystery.    Before we turn from Becket and his shrine to the other monuments in the  Trinity Chapel, we must call the attention of our readers to the stained  windows which depict the miracles of the sainted martyr. The chapel was at  one time entirely surrounded with glass of this sort, but only a portion  has survived the ravages of the Puritans. \"Of these windows,\" says Austin,  \"unfortunately but three remain, but they are sufficient to attest their  rare beauty; and for excellence of drawing, harmony of colouring, and  purity of design, are justly considered unequalled. The skill with which  the minute figures are represented cannot even at this day be surpassed;  it is extraordinary to see how every feeling of joy or sorrow, pain and  enjoyment, is expressed both in feature and position. But in nothing is  the superiority of these windows shown more than the beautiful scrolls and  borders which surmount the windows, and gracefully connect the groups of  medallions.\" Most of these windows probably contained representations of  Becket, and so were doomed to destruction by the decree of Henry VIII., in  which \"his Grace straitly chargeth and commandeth, that henceforth the  said Thomas Becket shall not be esteemed, named, reputed, nor called a  saint, but Bishop Becket, and that his images and pictures throughout the  whole realm shall be put down and avoided out of all churches and chapels,  and other places; and that from henceforth the days used to be festivals  in his name shall not be observed, nor the service, office, antiphonies,  collects and prayers in his name read, but rased and put out of all  books.\" This proclamation was rigorously carried out though the stained  windows which come within its terms have, in some cases, escaped  destruction. For instance there remains a window in the south transept of  Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, representing the martyrdom of Becket, but  it is interesting to note that even here the archbishop's head was removed  from the glass. Three of the windows of the Trinity Chapel have survived,  and fragments of others are scattered over the glass of the building. They  are entirely devoted to depicting the miracles of the martyr, which began  immediately after his death and reception--according to a vision of  Benedict--in a place between the apostles and the martyrs, above even St.  Stephen.    The window towards the east on the north side of the shrine is divided  into geometrical figures, each figure composed of a group of fine  medallions; every group tells the story of a miracle, or series of  miracles, performed by the influence of the saint. The lower group  portrays the story of a child who was drowned in the Medway, and  afterwards restored to life by the efficacy of the saint's blood mixed  with water. The first medallion shows the boy falling into the stream,  while his companions pelt the frogs in the reeds by the river side; the  next shows the companions relating the story of the accident to the boy's  parents, and in the third we see the grief-stricken parents watching their  son's corpse being drawn out of the river. \"The landscape in these  medallions is exceedingly well rendered; the trees are depicted with  great grace\" (Austin). Unfortunately the medallions which complete this  story have been destroyed. The next group depicts the quaint story of a  succession of miracles which were wrought in the family of a knight called  Jordan, son of Eisult. His ten year old boy died, and the knight, who had  been an intimate friend of Becket in his lifetime, resolved to try to  restore his son with water mixed with the saint's blood. At the third  draught, as Benedict tells the story, the dead boy \"opened one eye, and  said, 'Why are you weeping, father? Why are you crying, lady? The blessed  martyr, Thomas, has restored me to you!' At evening he sat up, ate,  talked, and was restored.\" But the father forgot the vow which he made in  the first moment of joy at his son's recovery, namely, that he would offer  four silver pieces at the martyr's shrine before Mid Lent. And once more  all the household was stricken with sickness, and the eldest son died.  Then the parents, though sore smitten themselves, dragged themselves to  Canterbury and performed their vow. The whole of this story with other  details for which we have no space may be accurately traced on this unique  window. The most striking is the central medallion of the group in which  the vengeance of the saint is shown forth. In the middle of a large room  we see a bier on which lies the dead son; the father and mother, overcome  with despair, stand at the head and feet of the body. Behind the bier are  several figures, which, from their \"unusually violent attitudes expressive  of grief,\" Mr. Austin considered to be professional mourners. Above,  unseen by the group below, the figure of St. Thomas, clad in full  episcopal robes, holding a sword in his right hand, and pointing to  the corpse with his left, is seen appearing through the ceiling. \"The  expression,\" says Austin, \"of the various figures in the above  compartments, both in gesture and feature, is rendered with great skill.  In the execution of this story, the points which, doubtless, the artists  of the monastery were chiefly anxious to impress upon the minds of the  devotees who thronged to the shrine are prominently brought out: the  extreme danger of delaying the performance of a vow, under whatever  circumstances made, the expiation sternly required by the saint, and the  satisfaction with which the martyr viewed money offerings made at the  shrine.\"    One of the other groups is noteworthy as proving that severe penances were  sometimes performed before the shrine. One medallion shows a woman  prostrating herself before a priest at the altar, while two men stand  near, holding formidable-looking rods. The next picture represents the two  men vigorously flagellating the woman with the rods; while, in the third,  one of the men is still beating the woman, who now lies fainting on the  ground, while the other is addressing the priest, who sits hard by  composedly reading his book. The other two windows contain representations  of the healings effected by the saint, which seem to have been of a very  varied character, to judge from the catalogue with which Benedict sums  them up. \"What position,\" he asks, \"in the Church, what sex or age, what  rank or order is there, which could not find something beneficial to  itself [_aliquid sibi utile_] in this treasure-house of ours? Here the  light of truth is furnished to schismatics, confidence to timid pastors,  health to the sick, and pardon to the deserving penitent [_paenitentibus  venia ejus meritis_, the last two words probably implying an offering].  The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the  dead rise again, the dumb speak, the poor have the gospel preached to  them, the paralytic recover, the dropsical lose their swellings  [_detumescunt hydropici_], the mad are restored to sense, the epileptic  are cured, the fever-stricken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#16)"],[1," and twenty yards.\"    Corney controlled the gratified smile that wrestled with the corners of  his mouth, but his bright eyes shone a trifle brighter for the moment.    It was no mere killing for killing's sake, for the Woodchuck was  spreading a belt of destruction in the crop around his den. Its flesh  supplied the family with more than one good meal and Corney showed Thor  how to use the skin. First the pelt was wrapped in hardwood ashes for  twenty-four hours. This brought the hair off. Then the skin was soaked  for three days in soft soap and worked by hand, as it dried, till it  came out a white strong leather.    Thor's wanderings extended farther in search of the things which always  came as surprises however much he was looking for them. Many days were  blanks and others would be crowded with incidents, for unexpectedness  is above all the peculiar feature of hunting, and its lasting charm.  One day he had gone far beyond the ridge in a new direction and passed  through an open glade where lay the broken trunk of a huge basswood.  The size impressed it on his memory. He swung past the glade to make  for the lake, a mile to the west, and twenty minutes later he started  back as his eye rested on a huge black animal in the crotch of a  hemlock, some thirty feet from the ground. A Bear! At last, this was  the test of nerve he had half expected all summer; had been wondering  how that mystery \"himself\" would act under this very trial. He stood  still; his right hand dived into his pocket and, bringing out three or  four buckshot, which he carried for emergency, he dropped them on top  of the birdshot already in the gun, then rammed a wad to hold them down.    The Bear had not moved and the boy could not see its head, but now he  studied it carefully. It was not such a large one--no, it was a small  one, yes, very small--a cub. A cub! That meant a mother Bear at hand,  and Thor looked about with some fear, but seeing no signs of any except  the little one, he levelled the gun and fired.    Then to his surprise down crashed the animal quite dead; it was not a  Bear, but a large Porcupine. As it lay there he examined it with wonder  and regret, for he had no wish to kill such a harmless creature. On its  grotesque face he found two or three long scratches which proved that  he had not been its only enemy. As he turned away he noticed some blood  on his trousers, then saw that his left hand was bleeding. He had  wounded himself quite severely on the quills of the animal without  knowing it. He was sorry to leave the specimen there, and Loo, when she  learned of it, said it was a shame not to skin it when she \"needed a  fur-lined cape for the winter.\"    On another day Thor had gone without a gun, as he meant only to gather  some curious plants he had seen. They were close to the clearing; he  knew the place by a fallen elm. As he came to it he heard a peculiar  sound. Then on the log his eye caught two moving things. He lifted a  bough and got a clear view. They were the head and tail of an enormous  Lynx. It had seen him and was glaring and grumbling; and under its foot  on the log was a white bird that a second glance showed to be one of  their own precious hens. How fierce and cruel the brute looked! How  Thor hated it! and fairly gnashed his teeth with disgust that now, when  his greatest chance was come, he for once was without his gun. He was  in not a little fear, too, and stood wondering what to do. The Lynx  growled louder; its stumpy tail twitched viciously for a minute, then  it picked up its victim, and leaping from the log was lost to view.    As it was a very rainy summer, the ground was soft everywhere, and the  young hunter was led to follow tracks that would have defied an expert  in dryer times. One day he came on piglike footprints in the woods. He  followed them with little difficulty, for they were new, and a heavy  rain two hours before had washed out all other trails. After about half  a mile they led him to an open ravine, and as he reached its brow he  saw across it a flash of white; then his keen young eyes made out the  forms of a Deer and a spotted Fawn gazing at him curiously. Though on  their trail he was not a little startled. He gazed at them  open-mouthed. The mother turned and raised the danger flag, her white  tail, and bounded lightly away, to be followed by the youngster,  clearing low trunks with an effortless leap, or bending down with  catlike suppleness when they came to a log upraised so that they might  pass below.    He never again got a chance to shoot at them, though more than once he  saw the same two tracks, or believed they were the same, as for some  cause never yet explained, Deer were scarcer in that unbroken forest  than they were in later years when clearings spread around.    He never again saw them; but he saw the mother once--he thought it was  the same--she was searching the woods with her nose, trying the ground  for trails; she was nervous and anxious, evidently seeking. Thor  remembered a trick that Corney had told him. He gently stooped, took up  a broad blade of grass, laid it between the edges of his thumbs, then  blowing through this simple squeaker he made a short, shrill bleat, a  fair imitation of a Fawn's cry for the mother, and the Deer, though a  long way off, came bounding toward him. He snatched his gun, meaning to  kill her, but the movement caught her eye. She stopped. Her mane  bristled a little; she sniffed and looked inquiringly at him. Her big  soft eyes touched his heart, held back his hand; she took a cautious  step nearer, got a full whiff of her mortal enemy, bounded behind a big  tree and away before his merciful impulse was gone. \"Poor thing,\" said  Thor, \"I believe she has lost her little one.\"    Yet once more the Boy met a Lynx in the woods. Half an hour after  seeing the lonely Deer he crossed the long ridge that lay some miles  north of the shanty. He had passed the glade where the great basswood  lay when a creature like a big bob-tailed Kitten appeared and looked  innocently at him. His gun went up, as usual, but the Kitten merely  cocked its head on one side and fearlessly surveyed him. Then a second  one that he had not noticed before began to play with the first, pawing  at its tail and inviting its brother to tussle.    Thor's first thought to shoot was stayed as he watched their gambols,  but the remembrance of his feud with their race came back. He had  almost raised the gun when a fierce rumble close at hand gave him a  start, and there, not ten feet from him, stood the old one, looking big  and fierce as a Tigress. It was surely folly to shoot at the young ones  now. The boy nervously dropped some buckshot on the charge while the  snarling growl rose and fell, but before he was ready to shoot at her  the old one had picked up something that was by her feet; the boy got a  glimpse of rich brown with white spots--the limp form of a newly killed  Fawn. Then she passed out of sight. The Kittens followed, and he saw  her no more until the time when, life against life, they were weighed  in the balance together.      IV    THE TERROR OF THE WOODS    Six weeks had passed in daily routine when one day the young giant  seemed unusually quiet as he went about. His handsome face was very  sober and he sang not at all that morning.    He and Thor slept on a hay-bunk in one corner of the main room, and  that night the Boy awakened more than once to hear his companion  groaning and tossing in his sleep. Corney arose as usual in the morning  and fed the horses, but lay down again while the sisters got breakfast.  He roused himself by an effort and went back to work, but came home  early. He was trembling from head to foot. It was hot summer weather,  but he could not be kept warm. After several hours a reaction set in  and Corney was in a high fever. The family knew well now that he had  the dreaded chills and fever of the backwoods. Margat went out and  gathered a lapful of pipsissewa to make tea, of which Corney was  encouraged to drink copiously.    But in spite of all their herbs and nursing the young man got worse. At  the end of ten days he was greatly reduced in flesh and incapable of  work, so on one of the \"well days\" that are usual in the course of the  disease he said:    \"Say, gurruls, I can't stand it no longer. Guess I better go home. I'm  well enough to drive to-day, for a while anyway; if I'm took down I'll  lay in the wagon, and the horses will fetch me home. Mother'll have me  all right in a week or so. If you run out of grub before I come back  take the canoe to Ellerton's.\"    So the girls harnessed the horses; the wagon was partly filled with  hay, and Corney, weak and white-faced, drove away on the long rough  road, and left them feeling much as though they were on a desert island  and their only boat had been taken from them.    Half a week had scarcely gone before all three of them, Margat, Loo,  and Thor, were taken down with a yet more virulent form of chills and  fever.    Corney had had every other a \"well day,\" but with these three there  were no \"well days\" and the house became an abode of misery.    Seven days passed, and now Margat could not leave her bed and Loo was  barely able to walk around the house. She was a brave girl with a fund  of drollery which did much toward keeping up all their spirits, but her  merriest jokes fell ghastly from her wan, pinched face. Thor, though  weak and ill, was the strongest and did for the others, cooking and  serving each day a simple meal, for they could eat very little,  fortunately, perhaps, as there was very little, and Corney could not  return for another week.    Soon Thor was the only one able to rise, and one morning when he  dragged himself to cut the little usual slice of their treasured bacon  he found, to his horror, that the whole piece was gone. It had been  stolen, doubtless by some wild animal, from the little box on the shady  side of"]]]
