Plain black  or white stocks tied with a front bow, and a starched or unstarched  collar with a frilled or gathered shirt-front were in use. A tie-pin or  stud was also seen in the centre of the stock or frilling.    The same hats as in the latter part of the 18th century continued for a  time, but the top-hat had established its favour, and assumed various  shapes throughout this reign.    [Illustration: Plate XXVI.--        (_a_) Morning Coat of Chintz. 1825-45.            _Pattern, see p. 313._      (_b_) Cloth Coat. 1808-20.            _Pattern, see p. 307._      (_c_) Cloth Overcoat. 1820-35.            _Pattern similar to p. 311._]    The coats were set with very high turn-over collars and a wide-shaped  lapel, and the lapel of the waistcoat was still brought outside. As  these lapels on the coats became smaller and changed into a roll collar,  they were cut into points at the breast, as seen in the illustrations.    The front of the coat cut away in a short square, rather high in the  waist, which thus formed a long-tailed skirt; the fronts were made  double-breasted, and were often fastened high up the lapel. The  hip-pleats had gone round more to the back into a closely pressed fold,  about three inches from the back-opening. Sleeves were gathered rather  full in the shoulders, becoming very tight on the forearm, and were  finished in a cuff, or buttoned cuff-shape. We also see that a short  square coat without tails was worn over the longer one. Overcoats (or  long-skirted coats) with a cape or capes, up to four, were worn all  through this reign, both double and single breasted, sometimes with  turn-up cuffs; but this mode was not frequently used, as a sewn-on cuff  or cuff made in the sleeve was now worn, and began to take a curved  shape well over the hand, with three buttons to fasten it on the outer  sides.    Short double-breasted waistcoats continued much the same, but a  round-shaped lapel appeared on many.    Very tight-fitting breeches were worn of the same 18th-century cut, and  trousers began to gain favour; a fob of seals, &c., was always worn,  coming from under the waistcoat.    Soft high boots with turn-down tops, and boots with longish brown tops  set low on the leg. The top-boot with the pointed or oval-shaped front  and tassel still held sway, and an oval-toed low shoe with or without  small latchets was in use.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE IV. FEMALE.    The hair at this period was worn in plaits or curls gathered on top, and  during the latter years was arranged into stiff loops set with a high  comb; a group of curls was drawn to the sides of the face, the hair  being mostly parted from the centre. Plumes were much used for  head-dresses, and caps with gathered puffs and pointed frills. A  high-crowned straw poke bonnet, tilted upwards, was still in form; but  the prevailing mode was a silk bonnet, with the brim curved in at the  front, the sides being drawn together under the chin with a bow. The  prevailing decoration was a group of feathers thrown forward or ribbon  loops, and after this a large round hat, with a full gathered crown,  arrived about 1827, or straw shapes, such as Fig. A, Plate XXVIII (see  p. 259).    [Illustration: FIG. 110.]    Dresses gradually assumed a longer waist, and a short pointed bodice  made its appearance here and there from about 1822, when short stays  began to return, and pointed belt corselets were frequent, though the  waistband or sash was chiefly used. Short puffed sleeves of charming  character and workmanship were sometimes set in a gauze sleeve, as in  Fig. C, Plate XXIII (see p. 218). Spencers and pelisses had long sleeves  coming from these short ones; they were rather full, and were caught at  the wrist with a band. The upper sleeve gradually disappeared as the  full-topped sleeves began to develop in size, about 1824; this fullness  was often broken up into gathered parts, a tight cuff-piece usually  finished at the wrist. The high set-up collars and neck-frills gave way  to the flat capes about 1827, though the small ruffs were worn round the  top of the high-necked capes to 1830. The gathered shoulder began  about 1823, and soon became a marked feature; pointed or scalloped  frills and trimmings came into favour from 1825, Fig. B, Plate XXIII  (see p. 218), and about 1827 the sloped appearance in the bodice began  to be noticed as the sleeves were set lower. The shoulders in ball  dresses were shown, and a gathered Bertha of silk or lace was arranged  round the neck of bodice, Fig. D, Plate XXIV (see p. 231), or this form  was made in the pattern as in Fig. C, Plate XXII (see p. 215). The  =V=-shaped piece from the centre of waist or breast began to spread over  the shoulders, where it was opened, as in Fig. B, Plate XXII (see p.  215). This =V= shape was often open down to the waist, where it was filled  in with a centre-piece of embroidery. Skirts were gradually set out  fuller, with stiff-flounced petticoats; they had various simple or  richly decorated borders and fronts, or several small flounces, or one  deep one often with the edges cut into divers shapes.    [Illustration: Plate XXVII.--Outdoor Silk Dress. 1825-35.]    [Illustration: FIG. 111.]    I have striven to give good examples of the marked styles in the various  dated illustrations, as well as the court train to dress, Fig. A, Plate  XXXIII (see p. 282), which also comes into this time.    Shoes were rather round at the toes till near the end of the reign, when  they took a square shape; a tiny rosette or bow was placed at the front  of instep, and they were held by narrow ribbons, crossed and tied round  the ankle. Boots lacing at the inside, with seam down the front, often  had a toe-cap as in Fig. 5, Plate XXI (see p. 202); no heels were worn.    Light gauze scarves were usually carried, and very small fans besides  the larger feather ones. Bags or sachets of the forms illustrated were  painted or embroidered in ribbonwork, chenille, tulle, and coloured  silks.    A few specimens of parasols are also given, and gloves and mittens were  of the same character as in the latter part of the last reign.    The patterns given of some of the dresses shown in the plates will be  useful as to the measurements of the increase in skirt-width and  sleeves; one may also note the very pointed set-out of the breast,  sometimes made with two gores, which only occurs in this reign. Muffs  were usually of a large size, and a bow with long ends was often worn on  the front.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE IV. 1820-30. MALE.    The mode in beaver hats was most varied; high straight crowns with small  brims, others tapering at the top with larger curled brims, or crowns  enlarging at the top with almost straight small brims; a top-hat of  straw is shown on page 309. A short-crowned hat was also worn. The hair  was combed towards the front at either side, and the face shaven, with  the exception of short side-whiskers.    A very high stock of black satin or linen surrounded the throat, with or  without the points of collar showing, and a frilled shirt, often stiffly  goffered.    Coats were very tight-fitting and mostly double-breasted, with long  swallow-tailed skirts, or long full skirts; the waist was rather short,  and the effect of coat-front round-breasted with a high turned-over  collar finished in large lapels, which were often treated with velvets.  The favourite colours for overcoats were greys, buffs, greens, and  blues, and the edges were neatly finished with fine cord. The sleeves,  rather full in the shoulder, became tight on the lower arm, coming to  a curved shape well over the hand, and buttoned up the side. The pockets  were frequently set at an angle, as in illustration, and a short round  cape, or two, was seen on many overcoats. A short type of coat is seen  about 1827, with a single roll collar.    [Illustration: FIG. 112.--Period 1820-1840.]    Waistcoats mostly had a round-shaped lapel, and were often  double-breasted and very shaped at the waist, which was set fairly high;  a long opening allowed the frilled shirt-front full display. There were  also waistcoats having no lapels, no pockets, or no cover-flap; the  points of front were very small, being buttoned to the end, or, with the  double-breasted shape, they were straight across.    Breeches were not so much worn as trousers of cloth, nankeen, drill, and  fine white corduroy; these were usually fastened under the boots with a  strap, others were looser and often worn short, well above the ankle. A  very full type in the upper part peg-tops, was in fashion about 1820-25  amongst the dandies, and for evening dress, very close-fitting breeches  to the knee, or just above the ankle, the latter being opened and  buttoned up to the calf. Pince-nez were favoured, with a heavy black  ribbon, generally worn tucked in the lapels of the waistcoat; and a fob  of gold seals, &c., hung from the braces, below waistcoat pocket.    [Illustration: FIG. 113.--1830-1840.]    Shoes and short Wellington boots were chiefly worn, the former being low  in the heel and very short in the tongue, which was almost covered by  small latchets, either buckled or tied, the shape of the toe being  rather round. The Hessian boots with curved front and tassel at the top  were still worn.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. WILLIAM IV. FEMALE.    The hair still retained the high loops on top and the bunch of curls at  the sides, poised by a back comb and set with flowers or feathers; there  was also a great variety of fancy capes with pointed frills, some with  long tie ends, and these are seen with most dresses, and were worn in  conjunction with the hats. The favourite hat was a big, flat, circular  form, generally tilted at one side, and decorated with bows, flowers,  and feathers; a flat tam-o'-shanter shape was often worn with the  riding-dress, sometimes with a large peak-shape in front, and straps  under the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34984"],[0,"A Guide for the Study of Animals (#16)"],[1,"nes;  limpets; oyster drill; periwinkle; mussel; cuttle fish; octopus;  nautilus; argonaut.      6.

Show how the transparent color of a paramecium, the green color of  a cabbage worm, or the green color of a certain species of hydra may  result in protecting an animal from its enemies. Mention as many  other examples as you can.    2. What is gained by the ability of a squid to change its color? How  is this change brought about?    3. Explain the protective coloration of the following: Dead-leaf  butterfly, walking stick, geometrid larva. Hunt up other examples.    4.

Explain the reason for the bright color.    6. How may the difference between the color of the upper and lower  surfaces of animals be explained on the basis of use to the animal?    7. (Optional) Find out some other uses of color to an animal aside  from protection.          _Summary._    1. Name four uses of color.    2. Name four ways an animal is protected by being like its  background.    3. Name one way it is protected by being unlike its background.    4. What disadvantages in this method of protection?      #C. ANIMAL ASSOCIATIONS#    #To show Another Method of Protection from Enemies#          _Materials._    Specimens, charts, etc., illustrating animal associations.          _Definitions._    _Animal communities_, associations of many animals of the same  species in communities in which there is a greater or less division  of labor.    _Gregarious_, associations where there is but little division of  labor.    _Parasitism_, an association where one animal lives at the expense of  the other. The animal on which the parasite lives is called the host.  If there are two hosts during the life cycle of the parasite, the  second host is called an intermediate host.    _Symbiosis_, an association where two animals live together in  mutually helpful relations.    _Commensalism_, an association where two animals live together in  relations not mutually helpful but without injury to either.          _Observations and questions._      _Note._--To find answers to many of these questions it will be    necessary to refer to the reference books in the laboratory.    1.
