Meanwhile our centre, under  Colonel Hamilton, was to attack a hill where the enemy was in force,  rout him and join in the general scheme, while Colonel Carleton  protected the centre from a flank movement. Unfortunately \"the best laid  schemes o' mice and men gang aft agley,\" and General White's admirable  scheme failed, as we shall learn. An artillery duel began operations,  and this continued for two long hours, while the warm spring morning  developed, and the Boers, who had been warned of our plans and had  changed their position during the night, were laughing in their sleeves  at the capital surprise they had prepared. They had drawn off their men  from the point that was to have been the objective of our centre, and  extending and reinforcing their left, were calmly waiting our attack.  The artillery duel continued till seven o'clock, our batteries with  great difficulty searching out the enemy's position. Colonel Grimwood,  with two battalions of the King's Royal Rifles, held the kopjes and  ridges in front of Farquhar's Farm, while mounted infantry and troopers  of the 18th Hussars, supported by the Liverpools and Leicesters, were  posted on the hills on the right. Behind them came the artillery, who  directed their fire at the hill above the farm, where the enemy was  supposed to be intrenched.    [Illustration: BEFORE LADYSMITH--HORSE ARTILLERY GALLOPING TO TAKE UP A  NEW POSITION.    Drawn by R. Caton Woodville.]    The Boers, who in great hordes had streamed from the hills like a  mountain torrent and concealed themselves in the surrounding ridges, now  made all Colonel Grimwood's plans impossible. He seemed, indeed, in  danger of being annihilated by sheer force of superior numbers, when  troops from the centre were pushed forward to his support. A smart  engagement ensued, the Boers making energetic efforts to penetrate the  line between the Infantry and Artillery, while the 53rd Battery changed  front to meet the attack and the 5th Lancers struggled to form up on the  left of the rifle regiments. But the enemy's automatic quick-firing gun  vomited forth its death-dealing steel with such persistence that the  cavalry was forced to retire at a gallop. The gunners again came to the  rescue, and six field-batteries, spread over in a semicircular front of  three-quarters of a mile, sent their shrapnel over the heads of the  infantry to crash on the ridges occupied by the Boers.    At this critical moment, when the turmoil of warfare was at its  hottest, and when our gallant troops were struggling unsuccessfully to  hold their own against an overwhelming number of the enemy, a message  came from Sir George White to retire. Some sort of a panic had taken  place in the town, owing partly to the fact that the Boers were  threatening it from another quarter, partly to the persistent shelling  of \"Long Tom,\" which, as some one described, was like a voluble virago,  determined to have the last word! All efforts to silence the horrible  weapon had failed, and for some three or four hours it had sent its  eighty-four-pound shells shrieking into the town. There was no resource  but to fall back, which was done to the appalling detonations of the  Boer guns all going at once, while \"Long Tom,\" like some prominent  solo-singer, dominated the whole clamouring orchestra. To silence him  and to cover the retreat, a Lieutenant of the _Powerful_, in charge of a  gun drawn by a team of oxen, went out on the road between Limit Hill and  Ladysmith. Before the gun could be got in position, however, \"Long Tom\"  had spotted it--barked at it--overturned it, and killed several of the  oxen. But his triumph was short-lived. Another rival performer had come  on the scene, namely, the twelve-and-a-half-pounder of the Naval  Brigade. It came, saw, and conquered, knocking out \"Long Tom\" at the  fourth shot!    [Illustration: TYPES OF ARMS--THE CREUSOT QUICK-FIRING FIELD GUN, OR  \"LONG TOM\"]    The whole action of the Naval Brigade reads like a fairy story.  Ladysmith on the point of exhaustion, with all its troops engaged and no  big guns wherewith to meet the terrific assaults of the six-inch cannon  on Pepworth Hill, was almost in despair. At the eleventh hour up came  the Naval Brigade under Captain the Hon. Hedworth Lambton of H.M.S.  _Powerful_ with 280 Bluejackets, two 4.7 guns, and four  twelve-and-a-half-pounders. Then the affair was done. It was just one,  two, three, and away--for the fourth splendidly-directed shot saved the  situation.    In this engagement great feats of daring were accomplished, feats which  have now become so general that we have almost ceased to gasp in wonder  at the heroism of the \"mere man\" of the nineteenth century. When the  regiments were forced to retire from the death-laden region of Lombard's  Kop, Major Abdy of the 53rd Battery R.A., dashing across the plain under  a storm of shells from a quick-firing gun, brought his battery between  the enemy and the straggling mass of retreating soldiers. Horse and man  rolled over, but the fire of the 53rd never slackened till the imminence  of danger was past. The correspondent of the _Standard_, who was  present, said: \"When the moment came for the battery to fall back, the  limber of one of the guns had been smashed and five horses in one team  had been killed. Captain Thwaites sent back for another team and waggon  limber, and brought back the disabled gun under a concentrated fire from  the enemy, who were not more than four hundred yards distant. Lieutenant  Higgins, of the same battery, also distinguished himself for gallantry.  One of the guns was overturned in a donga. In the face of a close and  heavy fire the Lieutenant succeeded in righting the gun and bringing it  into a place of safety.\"    The following is a list of killed and wounded among the officers who  were engaged on Lombard's Kop:--         13th Field Battery, R.A.--Major John Dawkins, wounded,       slightly. 42nd Field Battery.--Lieutenant James Taylor       M'Dougall, killed. 69th Field Battery.--Lieutenant Harold       Belcher, bullet wound, forearm, severely. 1st Battalion King's       Royal Rifles.--Major W. T. Myers (7th Battalion), Lieutenant H.       S. Marsden, and Lieutenant T. L. Forster, killed; Lieutenant H.       C. Johnson, bullet wound in shoulder, severely. 2nd Battalion       King's Royal Rifles.--Major H. Buchanan Riddell, bullet wound,       abdomen, severe. 1st Battalion Gloucestershire       Regiment.--Captain Willcock, bullet wound, shoulder and wrist;       Captain Bertram Fyffe, bullet wound, forearm and chest, severe;       Captain Frederick Staynes, bullet wound, forearm, severe.

THE DISASTER OF NICHOLSON'S NEK    The circumstances which attended the movements of Colonel Carleton's  column are even now somewhat fraught with mystery. He carried out the  night march unmolested until within two miles of Nicholson's Nek. Then  some boulders, loosened evidently for the purpose, rolled down the hill,  and a sudden crackling roll of musketry stampeded the infantry  ammunition mules. The alarm became infectious, with the result that the  battery mules also broke loose from their leaders, practically carrying  with them the whole of the gun equipment. The greater part of the  regimental small-arm ammunition reserve was similarly lost. In  consequence of this misfortune, Colonel Carleton's small force, after a  plucky fight and heavy loss, had to capitulate. The real truth about the  affair may never be known, but for the lamentable result Sir George  White in an official dispatch, with heroic courage--greater perhaps than  any required by warriors in the field--took upon himself the entire  blame. The General knew well that the failure of his programme in the  engagement of Lombard's Kop had inevitably brought about the disaster to  the isolated force.    The list of officers taken prisoners by Boers was as follows:--         Staff.--Major W. Adye. 1st Battalion Royal Irish       Fusiliers.--Lieutenant-Colonel F. R. C. Carleton; Majors F. H.       Munn and C. S. Kincaid; Captains Burrows, Rice, wounded, and       Silver, severely wounded; Lieutenants A. E. S. Heard, C. E.       Southey, W. G. B. Phibbs, A. H. C. MacGregor, H. B. Holmes, A.       L. J. M. Kelly, W. D. Dooner, wounded; Second Lieutenants R. J.       Kentish, C. E. Kinahan, R. W. R. Jeudwine; Chaplain Father       Matthews. 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment.--Majors S.       Humphrey, H. Capel Cure, and W. R. P. Wallace; Captains S.       Duncan and R. Conner, both slightly wounded; Lieutenants A.       Bryant, F. C. Nisbet, J. O'D. Ingram, R. M. M. Davy, C. S.       Knox, W. A. M. Temple, A. H. Radice, F. A. Breul, W. L. B.       Hill, P. H.

Some details of their misfortune were given by the prisoners in  Pretoria, and they serve to throw more light on the subject.    Colonel Carleton, as we know, was sent towards Nicholson's Nek to hold  it and prevent the Free Staters from coming to the assistance of the  other Boers. Having lost his reserve ammunition and the water of all the  battery through the stampede of the mules, he set to work to construct a  defensive position. But stones were scarce and the defences were  slender, and by the light of dawn his position was revealed. At this  time a long-range fire was opened from three hills to south and west,  dropping from 1500 yards into the position, and taking it both in flank  and in rear.

The aspic referred to is ordinary gelatin mixed  with soup stock instead of plain water. Remove the skin from sardines,  then split them open and take out the backbone and cut them into narrow  strips.    Mix together in equal quantities some stiff mayonnaise sauce and cool,  but liquid, aspic jelly then stir in some chopped capers and small  pieces of tomato, in the proportion of a dessertspoon of each to half a  pint of the mayonnaise and aspic mixture; and, lastly, add the sardines.    Have at hand some small tomato molds which have been rather thickly  lined with tomato aspic, fill them with the sardine mixture and leave on  ice until the jellies can be unmolded; serve each on a small leaf of  lettuce, and surround with a salad of water-cress and sliced tomatoes.

Cucumber Aspic    Four large cucumbers, one small onion, half a box of gelatine soaked in  half a cup of cold water, salt and white pepper to taste. Peel the  cucumbers, cut into thick slices and place, with the sliced onion, over  the fire with a scant quart of water. Simmer for an hour, stir in the  gelatine and, when this is dissolved, season the jelly, strain it and  set aside to cool. It may be formed into small moulds and turned out on  lettuce leaves, or used in a border-mould for garnishing a fish or  tomato salad, or set to form in a salad bowl and taken out by the  spoonful and served on lettuce leaves. French dressing is better with it  than mayonnaise.      Boiled Mayonnaise Dressing              1 egg            1 piece of butter size of walnut            1 tablespoon of sugar            1/2 teaspoon of mustard            1/2 teaspoon of salt            1/2 teaspoon white pepper            1 tablespoon cider vinegar            1 tablespoon boiling water just before putting in double boiler.

It will  take fully 1/2 hour, but the success of the dressing depends upon the  mayonnaise. Now stir in slowly 1/2 bottle chili sauce until well mixed  with the mayonnaise. Then chop together very fine 1 bunch of chives, 3  hard boiled eggs, 2 pimentos, 1/2 green pepper; add paprika and salt to  taste and mix well with the mayonnaise.

Beat  in slowly the butter melted, also add vinegar. Cook until it thickens.  It is best to make this in a double boiler. When cold, add 1 cup sweet  or sour cream.

Editress Suffrage Cook Book:              What do I think of woman suffrage? I wrote the            resolution in the Kansas Senate submitting the            constitutional amendment for it. When I became            Governor of Kansas I found a hundred little            orphans at our State Orphans' Home, mothered by a            man. The little unfortunates at our schools for            the deaf and the blind were mothered by men. I            placed women at the head of these institutions.            Among the other appointees during my term of            office was a woman on the Board of Administration,            the board having our educational institutions in            charge; a woman on the Board of Health; a woman            Factory Inspector; a woman Parole Officer; a woman            on the State Text Book Commission; two women on            the Board of Education, and women physicians at            our state hospitals. In every instance these women            gave the State of Kansas better service than did            the men whom they succeeded.              The women of Kansas have \"arrived\" and the state            service is better by their participating in it.
