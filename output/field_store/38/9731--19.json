I will also add that some  of these traps were brand new, while some of them were very rusty, so  I took first a new trap and then a rusty one, and set them  alternately around the bait, thinking that this arrangement, together  with the sour smell of the food, would confuse his nose a little, and  I think it did, at any rate, in about a week he came back and got  tangled up. He was caught only in one trap as his first jump would,  of course, pull all the other traps out of position.    \"He was a sorry looking specimen of a wolf, mixed up in all this  hardware (seven big No. 4 Hawley & Norton traps and one logging  chain), but we will have to excuse him as he \"didn't know it was  loaded.\" The best way is to fasten every trap separately, as in this  way he may get caught in several traps, or more than one might happen  to get caught at the same time, while if they hang together, he will  not be likely to get caught in more than one trap, as in his first  desperate struggle to escape he will pull the others out of position.    \"I suppose it will make some of the old 'war horses' laugh to see  that it takes seven traps at one bait to catch a wolf. This is the  only time I have had as many as seven traps handy, so I thought I  would fix him plenty. I generally use from one to three traps for  each set, depending on surrounding conditions.\"    In addition to the trapping methods given in the preceding pages,  there are many others used in the various sections of the country and  all of them have some good points.    All trappers make it a point to set a number of traps about the  carcass of any animal that has been killed by wolves, also animals  that have met death through other sources. The trouble is that in  open ground it requires so many traps to guard a large bait, and also  the wolves become very wary and refuse to approach a large bait after  one or two have been caught there.    For these reasons some trappers set their traps some distance away  from the carcass, using small baits, and so placing the trap among  clumps of brush and other natural objects that the wolf can only  reach the bait by walking over the trap. Others set their traps  without bait on any trails that may be found in the vicinity of the  carcass, trusting that the animals will follow these paths when  visiting the bait.    Some recommend dragging a large piece of bloody meat by tying to the  horn of the saddle with a rope and setting traps without bait in the  trail. Others set the traps in the same way and scatter small pieces  of fresh bait all about.    Another style of setting which is sometimes used is to bury a good  sized bait in a trail and set a trap on each side of the buried bait.  All of these methods will give good results at times but one should  never confine himself to any one method, as the animal will soon  learn his tricks and refuse to have his toes pinched. It is wise also  when using baits or scents to locate the set to the windward side of  the animals probable course of travel as all animals can scent a bait  at a much greater distance when passing to the leeward.    No matter what method is used, one must be a hustler and persevering.  One can not possibly make a great success of wolf trapping unless he  uses a large number of traps, and keeps them in working order and  well baited.        CHAPTER XIII.    SOUTHERN BAIT METHODS FOR COYOTES.    If there are many methods of trapping the wolf, there are still more  for catching the coyote, for it is a far more common animal, and  while its range is over a smaller area of country, it is found in far  greater numbers than the grey or timber wolf.    If there is any difference between the two, the coyote is more  cunning and wary than the wolf, but the fact that wolves do not care  for dead bait and the proportionately small number of the animals  makes the capture of them more difficult and the catch very much  lighter. All of the methods given for the grey wolf are good for the  coyote, and in addition we give here the methods of various others,  from all parts of the Southwest. The first is from Mr. Vasma Brown a  noted coyote trapper of Texas.    \"In the season of 1903-04, I commenced trapping about November 25th,  and stopped about March 1st. I used seven No. 2 Victor traps, but  consider No. 4 a better size. In the ninety-six nights that I  trapped, I caught 182 coyotes, 4 skunk, 12 opossum, 3 coons and 12  cats. I only trapped for coyotes, but these other animals came along  and got caught. Had I been trapping for skunk, opossum and wild cat,  I would have caught about 200 of each, but their pelts were not worth  more than 10 cents each.\"      [Illustration: A Trapped Texas Coyote.]    \"I took a piece of fresh meat and dragged it along a trail for about  a mile. About every two hundred yards I set a trap. I scratched a  hole in the ground just the size of the trap, put it in the hole and  covered it up with a piece of paper and sprinkled dirt or sand upon  it entirely concealing it. For bait, I cut some little pieces of meat  and put about six or eight around the trap and then went on and set  my other traps. I never failed to find two or three coyotes in my  traps. My biggest catch in one night was six coyotes and one coon. I  never use any scent. Fresh pork is the best scent that a person can  use. I tie my traps to a log or a piece of brush.\"    \"In the spring of the year, I have many calves and some hogs killed  and eaten by coyotes. A calf about six months old, is the finest kind  of bait for a coyote. A few years ago I saw a coyote kill a calf and  as soon as I could, I put a 38 Winchester bullet through him. As many  coyotes as I have caught in steel traps, I have never had one dig up  my trap. They are very easily caught.\"    \"In the winter of 1903 and 1904, I raced with a friend of mine  catching coyotes. Our trapping places were about five miles apart,  and there were just as many coyotes on his place as mine. I used  seven No. 2 and he used nine No. 3 traps. He also used scent and I  used none. When the day came to count and see who had the most hides,  I had the most by one hundred and three coyotes, besides twenty-one  other hides. He used scent and the animals were not very hungry. The  scent they found on a suspicious place, made them shy, because they  could not see what it was.\"    \"If you will all think about it, it is plain enough. If an animal is  hungry and sees a bait he is going to eat it whether it looks  suspicious or not; and if not hungry and he sees a trap with bait,  especially if he has ever been caught and gotten away, he will not  bother it. The slyest of all animals have been caught in the most  simple way a trap could be set, because they were hungry. My brother  and I used to, and do now, catch coyotes at the carcass of a dead  animal with our traps as unconcealed as you can set them. We always  have had good success. We catch about one-third of what comes  around.\"    \"In the fall of 1895, my brother found the carcass of a dead horse.  He set three No. 3 Newhouse traps at the carcass, and when it was all  consumed, he had thirty-six coyote hides. His traps were set on the  ground. A person could see them on the top of the ground at one  hundred yards distance. The coyotes were very hungry and they cared  for nothing but the flesh of the dead horse. They stepped everywhere,  and on and in everything. Hunger makes an animal easy to capture.\"    The ease with which the coyote of the Southwest may be captured only  goes to prove our statement in a previous chapter, that there is a  great difference in the nature of the animals found in widely removed  localities. It is certain that the coyotes of the Northwest could not  be captured in uncovered traps. There is also, as will be noted, a  great diversity of opinion regarding the value of scent. In parts of  the country where the animals take bait well, scent is seldom used  and would not be as successful as in other parts.    \"I trap on a small scale, but enjoy it more than any other  occupation,\" writes a New Mexico trapper. \"I intend trapping on a  large scale next winter. It is mostly skunks, coyotes, badger and  occasionally a fox and coon.\"    \"Some of the brother trappers complained of wolves being hard to  catch. There are very few here, but I can catch a coyote almost as  easy as a skunk. I have caught lots of them. The best place to set  the traps is on loose plowed ground or a sand bed, or anywhere you  can conceal the trap so another person couldn't locate exactly where  it is set. A cow trail is good. Setting it in grass is no good.    \"I dig out a place in the ground just the size of the trap, and so  the pan will be one-fourth of an inch below level, then set trap, put  in place, take a piece of stiff paper (not too stiff), large enough  to cover jaws, and place over jaws; then cover one-fourth inch with  fine loose dirt. Brush the ground down smooth so it will all look  alike. It is best to have two or three traps set at one setting, so  you will catch him by more than one foot. When caught by one foot,  they will soon sever their leg by jerking and twisting.\"    \"Another pointer, when you catch a coyote at a setting, don't move  your traps away, but set back in the same place, for the more you  catch at a setting the better chances you have to catch more. I've  caught six coyotes in one setting within the last two weeks. That  isn't extra good but they are scarce here.\"    \"By all means, don't pile up brush, stones, etc., around your traps  when trapping for coyote. It doesn't make any difference how much the  coyote scratches up the dirt, others will come back to the same  place.
