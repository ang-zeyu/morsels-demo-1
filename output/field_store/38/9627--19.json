The four gall-bladders are always perfectly distinct. The  adipose tissue is more abundant than ever: it forms by itself the  whole contents of the pseudochrysalis, for in the matter of volume the  insignificant threads of the nervous system and the digestive  apparatus count for nothing. It is the reserve upon which life must  draw for its future labours.    A few Sitares remain hardly a month in the pseudochrysalis stage. The  other phases are achieved in the course of August; and at the  beginning of September the insect attains the perfect state. But as a  rule the development is slower; the pseudochrysalis goes through the  winter; and it is not, at the earliest, until June in the second year  that the final transformations take place. Let us pass in silence over  this long period of repose, during which the Sitaris, in the form of a  pseudochrysalis, slumbers at the bottom of its cell, in a sleep as  lethargic as that of a germ in its egg, and come to the months of June  and July in the following year, the period of what we might call a  second hatching.    The pseudochrysalis is still enclosed in the delicate pouch formed of  the skin of the secondary larva. Outside, nothing fresh has happened;  but important changes have taken place inside. I have said that the  pseudochrysalis displayed an upper surface arched like a hog's back  and a lower surface at first flat and then more and more concave. The  sides of the double inclined plane of the upper or dorsal surface also  share in this depression occasioned by the evaporation of the fluid  constituents; and a time comes when these sides are so depressed that  a section of the pseudochrysalis through a plane perpendicular to its  axis would be represented by a curvilinear triangle with blunted  corners and inwardly convex sides. This is the appearance displayed by  the pseudochrysalis during the winter and spring.    But in June it has lost this withered appearance; it represents a  perfect balloon, an ellipsoid of which the sections perpendicular to  the major axis are circles. Something has also come to pass of greater  importance than this expansion, which may be compared with that which  we obtain by blowing into a wrinkled bladder. The horny integuments of  the pseudochrysalis have become detached from their contents, all of a  piece, without a break, just as happened the year before with the skin  of the secondary larva; and they thus form a fresh vesicular envelope,  free from any adhesion to the contents and itself enclosed in the  pouch formed of the secondary larva's skin. Of these two bags without  outlet, one of which is enclosed within the other, the outer is  transparent, flexible, colourless and extremely delicate; the second  is brittle, almost as delicate as the first, but much less translucent  because of its yellow colouring, which makes it resemble a thin flake  of amber. On this second sac are found the stigmatic warts, the  thoracic studs and so forth, which we noted on the pseudochrysalis.  Lastly, within its cavity we catch a glimpse of something the shape of  which at once recalls to mind the secondary larva.    And indeed, if we tear the double envelope which protects this  mystery, we recognize, not without astonishment, that we have before  our eyes a new larva similar to the secondary. After one of the  strangest transformations, the creature has gone back to its second  form. To describe the new larva is unnecessary, for it differs from  the former in only a few slight details. In both there is the same  head, with its various appendages barely outlined; the same vestiges  of legs, the same stumps transparent as crystal. The tertiary larva  differs from the secondary only by its abdomen, which is less fat,  owing to the absolute emptiness of the digestive apparatus; by a  double chain of fleshy cushions extending along each side; by the rim  of the stigmata, crystalline and slightly projecting, but less so than  in the pseudochrysalis; by the ninth pair of breathing-holes, hitherto  rudimentary but now almost as large as the rest; lastly by the  mandibles ending in a very sharp point. Evicted from its twofold  sheath, the tertiary larva makes only very lazy movements of  contraction and dilation, without being able to advance, without even  being able to maintain its normal position, because of the weakness of  its legs. It usually remains motionless, lying on its side, or else  displays its drowsy activity merely by feeble, wormlike movements.    By dint of these alternate contractions and dilations, indolent though  they be, the larva nevertheless contrives to turn right round in the  sort of shell with which the pseudochrysalidal integuments provide it,  when by accident it finds itself placed head downwards; and this  operation is all the more difficult inasmuch as the larva almost  exactly fills the cavity of the shell. The creature contracts, bends  its head under its belly and slides its front half over its hinder  half by wormlike movements so slow that the lens can hardly detect  them. In less than a quarter of an hour the larva, at first turned  upside down, finds itself again head uppermost. I admire this  gymnastic feat, but have some difficulty in understanding it, so small  is the space which the larva, when at rest in its cell, leaves  unoccupied, compared with that which we should be justified in  expecting from the possibility of such a reversal. The larva does not  long enjoy the privilege which enables it to resume inside its cell,  when this is moved from its original position, the attitude which it  prefers, that is to say, with its head up.    Two days, at most, after its first appearance it relapses into an  inertia as complete as that of the pseudochrysalis. On removing it  from its amber shell, we see that its faculty of contracting or  dilating at will is so completely paralysed that the stimulus of a  needle is unable to provoke it, though the integuments have retained  all their flexibility and though no perceptible change has occurred in  the organization. The irritability, therefore, which in the  pseudochrysalis is suspended for a whole year, reawakens for a moment,  to relapse instantly into the deepest torpor. This torpor will be  partly dispelled only at the moment of the passing into the nymphal  stage, to return immediately afterwards and last until the insect  attains the perfect state.    Further, on holding larvae of the third form, or nymphs enclosed in  their cells, in an inverted position, in glass tubes, we never see  them regain an erect position, however long we continue the  experiment. The perfect insect itself, during the time that it is  enclosed in the shell, cannot regain it, for lack of the requisite  flexibility. This total absence of movement in the tertiary larva,  when a few days old, and also in the nymph, together with the  smallness of the space left free in the shell, would necessarily lead  to the conviction, if we had not witnessed the first moments of the  tertiary larva, that it is absolutely impossible for the creature to  turn right round.    And now see to what curious inferences this lack of observations made  at the due moment may lead us. We collect some pseudochrysalids and  heap them in a glass jar in all possible positions. The favourable  season arrives; and with very legitimate astonishment we find that, in  a large number of shells, the larva or nymph occupies an inverted  position, that is to say, the head is turned towards the anal  extremity of the shell. In vain we watch these reversed bodies for any  indications of movement; in vain we place the shells in every  imaginable position, to see if the creature will turn round; in vain,  once more, we ask ourselves where the free space is which this turning  would demand. The illusion is complete: I have been taken in by it  myself; and for two years I indulged in the wildest conjectures to  account for this lack of correspondence between the shell and its  contents, to explain, in short, a fact which is inexplicable once the  propitious moment has passed.    On the natural site, in the cells of the Anthophora, this apparent  anomaly never occurs, because the secondary larva, when on the point  of transformation into the pseudochrysalis, is always careful to place  its head uppermost, according as the axis of the cell more or less  nearly approaches the vertical. But, when the pseudochrysalids are  placed higgledy-piggledy in a box or jar, all those which are upside  down will later contain inverted larvae or nymphs.    After four changes of form so profound as those which I have  described, one might reasonably expect to find some modifications of  the internal organization. Nevertheless, nothing is changed; the  nervous system is the same in the tertiary larva as in the earlier  phases; the reproductive organs do not yet show; and there is no need  to mention the digestive apparatus, which remains invariable even in  the perfect insect.    The duration of the tertiary larva is a bare four or five weeks, which  is also about the duration of the second. In July, when the secondary  larva passes into the pseudochrysalid stage, the tertiary larva passes  into the nymphal stage, still inside the double vesicular envelope.  Its skin splits along the back in front; and with the assistance of a  few feeble contractions, which reappear at this juncture, it is thrust  behind in the shape of a little ball. There is therefore nothing here  that differs from what happens in the other Beetles.    Nor does the nymph which succeeds this tertiary larva present any  peculiarity: it is the perfect insect in swaddling-bands, yellowish  white, with its various external members, clear as crystal, displayed  under the abdomen. A few weeks elapse, during which the nymph partly  dons the livery of the adult state; and, in about a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#16)"],[1,"one; there's old Buttercup in the big meadow, ride at  her, Tom, and see her run,\" proposed Dan, bent on mischief.    \"No, you mustn't,\" began Demi, who was learning to distrust Dan's  propositions.    \"Why not, little fuss-button?\" demanded Dan.    \"I don't think Uncle Fritz would like it.\"    \"Did he ever say we must not have a bull-fight?\"    \"No, I don't think he ever did,\" admitted Demi.    \"Then hold your tongue. Drive on, Tom, and here's a red rag to flap at  the old thing. I'll help you to stir her up,\" and over the wall went  Dan, full of the new game, and the rest followed like a flock of sheep;  even Demi, who sat upon the bars, and watched the fun with interest.    Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood, for she had been lately  bereft of her calf, and mourned for the little thing most dismally. Just  now she regarded all mankind as her enemies (and I do not blame her),  so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief  flying at the end of his long lance, she threw up her head, and gave  a most appropriate \"Moo!\" Tommy rode gallantly at her, and Toby  recognizing an old friend, was quite willing to approach; but when the  lance came down on her back with a loud whack, both cow and donkey were  surprised and disgusted. Toby back with a bray of remonstrance, and  Buttercup lowered her horns angrily.    \"At her again, Tom; she's jolly cross, and will do it capitally!\" called  Dan, coming up behind with another rod, while Jack and Ned followed his  example.    Seeing herself thus beset, and treated with such disrespect, Buttercup  trotted round the field, getting more and more bewildered and excited  every moment, for whichever way she turned, there was a dreadful boy,  yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip. It was  great fun for them, but real misery for her, till she lost patience and  turned the tables in the most unexpected manner. All at once she wheeled  short round, and charged full at her old friend Toby, whose conduct cut  her to the heart. Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped  over a stone, and down went horse, matadore, and all, in one ignominious  heap, while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall,  and galloped wildly out of sight down the road.    \"Catch her, stop her, head her off! run, boys, run!\" shouted Dan,  tearing after her at his best pace, for she was Mr. Bhaer's pet  Alderney, and if anything happened to her, Dan feared it would be all  over with him. Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as  there was before she was caught! The fish-poles were left behind; Toby  was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase; and every boy was red,  breathless, and scared. They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower  garden, where she had taken refuge, worn out with the long run.  Borrowing a rope for a halter, Dan led her home, followed by a party  of very sober young gentlemen, for the cow was in a sad state, having  strained her shoulder jumping, so that she limped, her eyes looked wild,  and her glossy coat was wet and muddy.    \"You'll catch it this time, Dan,\" said Tommy, as he led the wheezing  donkey beside the maltreated cow.    \"So will you, for you helped.\"    \"We all did, but Demi,\" added Jack.    \"He put it into our heads,\" said Ned.    \"I told you not to do it,\" cried Demi, who was most broken-hearted at  poor Buttercup's state.    \"Old Bhaer will send me off, I guess. Don't care if he does,\" muttered  Dan, looking worried in spite of his words.    \"We'll ask him not to, all of us,\" said Demi, and the others assented  with the exception of Stuffy, who cherished the hope that all the  punishment might fall on one guilty head. Dan only said, \"Don't bother  about me;\" but he never forgot it, even though he led the lads astray  again, as soon as the temptation came.    When Mr. Bhaer saw the animal, and heard the story, he said very little,  evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of  impatience. Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall, and the boys  sent to their rooms till supper-time. This brief respite gave them time  to think the matter over, to wonder what the penalty would be, and to  try to imagine where Dan would be sent. He whistled briskly in his room,  so that no one should think he cared a bit; but while he waited to know  his fate, the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger, the more he  recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here, the hardship and  neglect he had felt elsewhere. He knew they tried to help him, and at  the bottom of his heart he was grateful, but his rough life had made  him hard and careless, suspicious and wilful. He hated restraint of any  sort, and fought against it like an untamed creature, even while he knew  it was kindly meant, and dimly felt that he would be the better for it.  He made up his mind to be turned adrift again, to knock about the city  as he had done nearly all his life; a prospect that made him knit  his black brows, and look about the cosy little room with a wistful  expression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr. Bhaer's  if he had seen it. It vanished instantly, however, when the good man  came in, and said in his accustomed grave way,    \"I have heard all about it, Dan, and though you have broken the rules  again, I am going to give you one more trial, to please Mother Bhaer.\"    Dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve, but he only  said in his gruff way,    \"I didn't know there was any rule about bull-fighting.\"    \"As I never expected to have any at Plumfield, I never did make such  a rule,\" answered Mr. Bhaer, smiling in spite of himself at the boy's  excuse. Then he added gravely, \"But one of the first and most important  of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the  place. I want everybody and everything to be happy here, to love  and trust, and serve us, as we try to love and trust and serve them  faithfully and willingly. I have often said that you were kinder to the  animals than any of the other boys, and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in  you very much, because she thought it showed a good heart. But you have  disappointed us in that, and we are sorry, for we hoped to make you  quite one of us. Shall we try again?\"    Dan's eyes had been on the floor, and his hands nervously picking at  the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in, but when he  heard the kind voice ask that question, he looked up quickly, and said  in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before,    \"Yes, please.\"    \"Very well, then, we will say no more, only you will stay at home from  the walk to-morrow, as the other boys will and all of you must wait on  poor Buttercup till she is well again.\"    \"I will.\"    \"Now, go down to supper, and do your best, my boy, more for your own  sake than for ours.\" Then Mr. Bhaer shook hands with him, and Dan went  down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping  which Asia had strongly recommended.    Dan did try for a day or two, but not being used to it, he soon tired  and relapsed into his old wilful ways. Mr. Bhaer was called from home  on business one day, and the boys had no lessons. They liked this, and  played hard till bedtime, when most of them turned in and slept like  dormice. Dan, however, had a plan in his head, and when he and Nat were  alone, he unfolded it.    \"Look here!\" he said, taking from under his bed a bottle, a cigar, and a  pack of cards, \"I'm going to have some fun, and do as I used to with  the fellows in town. Here's some beer, I got if of the old man at the  station, and this cigar; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will, he's got  heaps of money and I haven't a cent. I'm going to ask him in; no, you  go, they won't mind you.\"    \"The folks won't like it,\" began Nat.    \"They won't know. Daddy Bhaer is away, and Mrs. Bhaer's busy with Ted;  he's got croup or something, and she can't leave him. We shan't sit up  late or make any noise, so where's the harm?\"    \"Asia will know if we burn the lamp long, she always does.\"    \"No, she won't, I've got a dark lantern on purpose; it don't give much  light, and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming,\" said Dan.    This idea struck Nat as a fine one, and lent an air of romance to the  thing. He started off to tell Tommy, but put his head in again to say,    \"You want Demi, too, don't you?\"    \"No, I don't; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him. He  will be asleep, so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again.\"    Nat obeyed, and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed, rather  tousled about the head and very sleepy, but quite ready for fun as  usual.    \"Now, keep quiet, and I'll show you how to play a first-rate game called  'Poker,'\" said Dan, as the three revellers gathered round the table, on  which were set forth the bottle, the cigar, and the cards. \"First we'll  all have a drink, then we'll take a go at the 'weed,' and then we'll  play. That's the way men do, and it's jolly fun.\"    The beer circulated in a mug, and all three smacked their lips over it,  though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff. The cigar was worse  still, but they dared not say so, and each puffed away till he was dizzy  or choked, when he passed the \"weed\" on to his neighbor. Dan liked  it, for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance  to imitate the low men who surrounded him. He drank, and smoked, and  swaggered as much like them as he could, and, getting into the spirit  of the part he assumed, he soon began to swear under his breath for  fear some one should hear him. \"You mustn't; it's wicked to say 'Damn!'\"  cried Tommy, who had followed his leader so far.    \"Oh, hang! don't you preach, but play away; it's part of the fun to  swear.\"    \"I'd rather say 'thunder turtles,'\" said Tommy, who had composed this  interesting exclamation and was very proud of it.    \""]]]
