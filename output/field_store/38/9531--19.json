Serious differences of opinion soon arose between Lord Chelmsford  and Sir Henry Bulwer, the Governor of Natal, but on the intricacies  of these it is unnecessary to dwell; suffice it to say, that they  were in a measure the cause of Sir Garnet Wolseley's arrival on the  scene somewhat later, as Sir Garnet united in his own person both  supreme civil and supreme military power.    A complete account of the movements of the various columns during  the dreary months that elapsed before the final victory at Ulundi on  the 4th of July cannot be attempted here. The history of skirmishes  and raids, of daring sorties, of captures of cattle, and gallantry  of troops, of hopes and disappointments, of successes and scares, of  hardships and horrors, would fill many pages that must be otherwise  occupied.    Yet one tragic and memorable event of the war cannot be passed over,  for we lost a gallant volunteer whose young life was full of promise  and distinction. At the beginning of June the Prince Imperial of  France, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, having studied at the Military  College at Woolwich, and desiring to see war in all its reality, was  attached to the Quartermaster-General's department at General  Newdigate's camp. He set out with a reconnoitring party consisting  of Lieutenant Carey of the 98th Regiment, six men of Bellington's  Horse, and a Kaffir. The place they intended to reach was situated  between the camps of Lord Chelmsford and General Wood. Having gained  a picturesque spot near a brook which forms a tributary to the  Tlyotyozi River, the Prince decided to sketch. He was a clever  draughtsman, and had some ability in recognising the capabilities of  positions. The party afterwards moved on, examining various empty  kraals by the way. At one of these they halted, and the Prince gave  orders to \"off-saddle\" for an hour. The place seemed deserted; there  were remains of a recent cooking fire, and a stray dog or two  sniffed suspiciously at the strangers. Round this spot near the  river tambookie grass about six feet in height formed a screen. The  officers made coffee, turned out their horses to graze, and lay for  a short rest in the peaceful security of a complete, or seemingly  complete, desolation.    But unknown to them, fifty Zulus, tiger-like, had crawled from  ambush and were preparing to spring. It was from the cover of the  river vegetation that they eventually burst forth. A hurried order  to remount, and the crash of rifles at a distance of twenty yards  followed. The tragic scene is well described by Mr. A. Wilmot in his  \"History of the Zulu War\":--    \"At this time the party were standing in a line close to their  horses, with their backs to the kraal and their faces turned  eastward, the Prince being in front and nearest to the Zulus. Then  with a tremendous cry, 'Usutu!' and 'Lo, the English cowards!' the  savages rushed on. The horses immediately swerved, and some broke  away. An undoubted panic seized the party; every one who could  spring on his horse mounted and galloped for his life. There was no  thought, no idea of standing fast and resisting this sudden attack.  The Prince was unwounded, but unable to mount his charger, which was  sixteen hands high and always difficult to mount. On this occasion  the horse became so frightened by the firing and sudden stampeding  as to rear and prance in such a manner as to make it impossible for  the Prince to gain the saddle. Many of the others saw the  difficulty, but none waited or tried to give the least assistance.  One by one they rushed their horses past, Private le Tocq exclaiming  as he went by, lying across his saddle, 'Depechez-vous, s'il vous  plait, monsieur!' The Prince, making no reply, strained every nerve,  but, alas! in vain, to gain the back of his horse, holding his  stirrup-leather with his left hand and the saddle with his right.  With the help of the holster he made one desperate effort, but the  holster partially gave way, and it must have been then that the  horse trod upon him and galloped off, leaving his master prostrate  on the ground. The Prince then regained his feet and ran after his  friends, who were far in advance. Twelve or thirteen Zulus were at  this time only a few feet behind him. The Prince then turned round,  and, sword in hand, faced his pursuers. From the first he had never  called for help, and now died bravely with his face to the foes,  fighting courageously to the last.    \"It is thought that the Zulus hurled their assegais at him, and that  he quickly fell dead, pierced through the eye by a mortal wound.\"    There is a certain sad satisfaction in remembering that this noble  youth, the hope of France, the worthy descendant of a great name,  should have died as a soldier and without more than a moment's  suffering.    The rest of the party had galloped off at full speed, thinking each  was engaged in the business of getting away. Lieutenant Carey, who  has been blamed for not having stood by the Prince in his perilous  position, shouted orders and imagined they were followed, and in his  hasty retreat had not time to do more than believe the whole party  thus surprised were galloping away together.    Arguments regarding this deplorable affair have been so many that it  is best to quote the evidence taken at the court-martial and the  statement of Lieutenant Carey:--    \"The Court is of opinion that Lieutenant Carey did not understand  the position in which he stood towards the Prince, and, as a  consequence, failed to estimate aright the responsibility which fell  to his lot. Colonel Harrison states that the senior combatant  officer, Lieutenant Carey, D.A.Q.M.G., was, as a matter of course,  in charge of the party, whilst, on the other hand, Carey says, when  alluding to the escort, 'I did not consider I had any authority over  it after the precise and careful instructions of Lord Chelmsford as  to the position the Prince held.' As to his being invariably  accompanied by an escort in charge of an officer, the Court  considers that the possibility of such a difference of opinion  should not have existed between two officers of the same department.  The Court is of opinion that Carey is much to blame for having  proceeded on the duty in question with a portion only of the escort  detailed by Colonel Harrison. The Court cannot admit the  irresponsibility for this on the part of Carey, inasmuch as he took  steps to obtain the escort and failed in so doing. Moreover, the  fact that Harrison was present upon the Itelezi range gave him the  opportunity of consulting him on the matter, of which he failed to  avail himself. The Court, having examined the ground, is of opinion  that the selection of the kraal, where a halt was made and the  horses off-saddled, surrounded as it was by cover for the enemy, and  adjacent to difficult ground, showed a lamentable want of military  prudence. The Court deeply regrets that no effort was made after the  attack to rally the escort, and to show a front to the enemy,  whereby the possibility of aiding those who had failed to make good  their retreat might have been ascertained.--Signed by General  MARSHALL; Colonel MALTHUS, 94th Regiment; Major LE GRICE, R.A.\"    On this report a court-martial was summoned by Lord Chelmsford for  the trial of Lieutenant Carey for having misbehaved before the enemy  on the 1st June 1879, when in command of an escort in attendance on  the Prince, who was making reconnaissances in Zululand; in having,  when the Prince and escort were attacked by the enemy, galloped  away, and in not having attempted to rally them or otherwise defend  the Prince. The Court, under the presidency of Colonel Glyn,  consisted of Colonels Whitehead, Courtney, Harness, Major Bouverie,  and Major Anstruther.    Judge-Advocate Brander prosecuted, and Captain Crookenden, R.A., was  for the defence.    When the Court opened the plan of the ground was proved.    Corporal Grubb said the Prince gave the order \"Off saddle\" at the  kraal, and \"Prepare to mount.\" The Prince mounted. After the volley  he saw Carey putting spurs to his horse, and he did the same. He saw  Abel fall, and Rogers trying to get a shot at the Zulus. Le Tocq  passed him and said, \"Put spurs to your horse, boy; the Prince is  down!\" He looked round and saw the Prince under his horse. A short  time after the Prince's horse came up, and he (Grubb) caught it. No  orders were given to rally.    Le Tocq was called and said: The Prince told the natives to search  the kraals, and finding no one there they off saddled. At the volley  he mounted, but, dropping his carbine, stopped to pick it up. In  remounting he could not get his leg over the saddle. He passed the  Prince, and said in French, \"Hasten to mount your horse.\" The Prince  did not answer. He saw the Prince's horse treading on his leg. The  Prince was in command of the party. He believed Carey and the Prince  would have passed on different sides of a hut in fast flight, and it  was possible that Carey might have failed to see that the Prince was  in difficulties. It was 250 yards from where he saw the Prince down  to the spot where he died.    Trooper Cochrane was called and said: The Prince was not in the  saddle at the time of mounting. He saw about fifty yards off the  Prince running down the donga with fourteen Zulus in close pursuit.  Nothing was done to help him. He heard no orders given, and did not  tell Carey what he had seen until some time after. He was an old  soldier. He did not think any rally could have been made.    The Court then adjourned to the next day. On reassembling, the first  witness called was    Sergeant Willis, who stated that he had seen Trooper Rogers lying on  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#16)"],[1,"ection. Scott's plan was to reduce Vera Cruz,  and thence march to the Mexican capital, two hundred miles away, by the  quickest route. Vera Cruz capitulated March 27, 1847.    Scott straightway struck out for the interior. He was bloodily opposed  at Cerro Gordo, April 18th, and at Jalapa, but he made quick work of the  enemy at both these places. In the latter city, after his victory, he  awaited promised re-enforcements. When the last of these had arrived,  August 6th, under General Franklin Pierce, so that he could muster about  14,000 men, he advanced again. August 10th the Americans were in sight  of the City of Mexico. This was a natural stronghold, and art had added  to its strength in every possible way. Except on the south and west it  was nearly inaccessible if defended with any spirit. Scott of course  directed his attack toward the west and south sides of the city. The  first battle in the environs of the capital was fiercely fought near the  village of Contreras, and proved an overwhelming defeat for the  Mexicans. Two thousand were killed or wounded, while nearly 1,000,  including four generals, were captured, together with a large quantity  of stores and ammunition. The American loss was only 60 killed and  wounded.    The survivors fled to Churubusco, farther toward the city, where, with  every advantage of position, Santa Anna had united his forces for a  final stand. An old stone convent, which our artillery could not reach  till late in the action, was utilized as a barricade, and from this the  Mexicans poured a most deadly fire upon their assailants. The Americans  were victorious, as usual, but their loss was fearful, 1,000 being  killed or wounded, including 76 officers. A truce to last a fortnight  was now agreed upon, but Scott, seeing that the Mexicans were taking  advantage of it to strengthen their fortifications, did not wait so  long. He now had about 8,500 men fit for duty, and sixty-eight guns.  Hostilities were renewed September 7th, by the storm and capture,  costing nearly 800 men, of Molino del Rey, or \"King's Mill,\" a mile and  a half from the city.    Possession of the Molino opened the way to Chapultepec, the Gibraltar of  Mexico, 1,100 yards nearer the goal. As it was built upon a rock 150  feet high, impregnable on the north and well-nigh so on the eastern and  most of the southern face, only the western and part of the southern  sides could be scaled. But the stronghold was the key to the city, and  after surveying the situation, a council of war decided that it must be  taken. Two picked American detachments, one from the west, one from the  south, pushed up the rugged steeps in face of a withering fire. The  rock-walls to the base of the castle had to be mounted by ladders. This  was successfully accomplished; the enemy were driven from the building  back into the city, and the castle and grounds occupied by our troops. A  large number of fugitives were cut off by a force sent around to the  north.      [Illustration: The Plaza of the City of Mexico.]      [1848]    To pierce the city was even now by no means easy. The approach was by  two roads, one entering the Belen gate, the other the San Cosme. General  Quitman advanced toward the Belen, but at the entrance was stopped by a  destructive cannonade from the citadel itself. Those fighting their way  toward the San Cosme succeeded in entering the city, Lieutenant U. S.  Grant making his mark in the gallant work of this day. The city was  evacuated that night, and on the 15th of September, 1847, was fully in  the hands of Scott.    The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848. It  established the Rio Grande as the boundary between the two countries,  and New Mexico, of course including what is now Arizona and also  California, was ceded to the United States for $15,000,000. The United  States also assumed, to the sum of $3,250,000, the claims of American  citizens upon Mexico. For Gadsden's Purchase, in 1853, between the Gila  River and the Mexican State of Chihuahua, we paid $10,000,000 more. Our  territory thus received in all, as a consequence of the Mexican War, an  increment of 591,398 square miles.    Inseparable from the politics of the Mexican War is the Oregon question,  since Oregon's re-occupation and \"fifty-four forty or fight\" had been  democratic cries for securing to Polk west-northern votes in 1844. We  had, however, no valid claim so far north, except against Russia--by the  treaty of 1824. The Louisiana purchase, indeed, had vested us with  whatever--very dubious--rights France had upon the Pacific, and the  Florida treaty of 1819 gave us the far better title of Spain to the  coast north of 42 degrees. This treaty, with Gray's discovery of the  Columbia in 1792, Lewis and Clarke's official explorations of the  Columbia valley in 1804-05-06, England's retrocession, in 1818, of  Astoria, captured during the War of 1812, and extensive actual  settlements upon the river by American citizens from 1832 on, made our  claim perfect up to 49 degrees at least. This parallel the convention  with Great Britain in 1818 had already fixed as our northern line from  the Lake of Woods to the Rocky Mountains. Between this and 54 degrees 40  minutes, England's title, from exploration and settlement, was superior  to ours, which was based upon alleged old Spanish discovery. The same  convention of 1818, renewed in 1827, opened the Oregon country to  occupation by settlers from both nations. Increase of immigration  rendering a fixing of jurisdictions imperative, England pressed for the  line of the Columbia below its intersection of the forty-ninth parallel.  We had twice offered to settle upon 49 degrees, which limit the rapid  growth of our population in the region induced England in 1836 to  accept. Whether Polk's blustering demand for \"all Oregon,\" which came  near bringing on war with England, and his much condemned recession  later, were mere opportunist acts, is still a question. Many consider  them pieces of a deep-laid policy by Polk to tole Mexico to war in hope  of England's aid, then, suddenly pacifying England, to devour Mexico at  his leisure.        CHAPTER IV.    CALIFORNIA AND THE COMPROMISE OF 1850    [1846]    One of the campaigns at the beginning of the Mexican War was that of  General Stephen W. Kearney, from Fort Leavenworth, against New Mexico.  It was opened in May, 1846. He invaded the country without much  opposition, arrived at Santa Fe August 18th, having marched 873 miles,  declared the inhabitants free from all allegiance to Mexico, and formed  a territorial government over them as United States subjects.    Captain John C. Fremont had previously, but in the same year, 1846, been  sent to California at the head of an exploring expedition, and in May he  was notified to remain in the country in anticipation of hostilities. On  June 15th he captured Samona. Meanwhile, Commodore Sloat was erecting  our flag over the towns on the coast. In July Sloat was superseded by  Commodore Stockton, who routed the Mexican commander, De Castro, at Los  Angeles, joined Fremont, and on August 13th seized Monterey, the then  capital. The two commanders now placed themselves at the head of a  provisional government for California.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Zachary Taylor. After a photograph by Brady.      [Illustration: Hillside facing bay, with about 35 houses. About 100  ships are in the bay.]  The Site of San Francisco in 1848.      [1848-1849]    In 1848, on the same day and almost at the same hour when the peace of  Guadalupe Hidalgo was concluded, gold was discovered in California. It  was on the land of one Sutter, a Swiss settler in the Sacramento Valley,  as some workmen were opening a flume for a mill. In three months over  4,000 persons were there, digging for gold with great success. By July,  1849, it is thought, 15,000 had arrived. Nearly all were forced to live  in booths, tents, log huts, and under the open sky. The sparse  population previously on the ground left off farming and grazing and  opened mines. People became insane for gold. Immigrants soon came in  immense hordes. In 1846, aside from roving Indians, California had  numbered not much over 15,000 inhabitants. By 1850, it seems certain  that the territory contained no fewer than 92,597. The new-comers were  from almost every land and clime--Mexico, South America, the Sandwich  Islands, China--though, of course, most were Americans. The bulk of  these hailed from the Northwest and the Northeast. To this land of  promise the sturdy pioneers from the Mississippi Valley found their way  on foot, on horseback, or in wagons, over the Rocky Mountains and the  Sierras, following trails previously untrodden by civilized man. Those  from the East made long detours around Cape Horn or across the Isthmus  of Panama.      [Illustration: A few log buildings and a tent in a small clearing.]  Sutter's Mill, California, where Gold was First Discovered.      The yield of gold from the virgin placers was enormous, a laborer's  average the first season being perhaps an ounce a day, though many made  much more. During the first two years about $40,000,000 worth of gold  was extracted. According to careful estimates the gold yield of the  United States, mostly from California, which had been only $890,000 in  1847, increased to $10,000,000 in 1848, to $40,000,000 in 1849, to  $50,000,000 in 1850, to $55,000,000 in 1851, to $60,000,000 in 1852, and  in 1853 to $65,000,000.    Most interesting were the spontaneous governmental and legal  institutions which arose in these motley communities, some of them  finding their originals in the English mining districts, others in  Mexico and Spain, and still others recalling the mining customs of  medieval Germany. For a time many camps had each its independent  government, disconnected from all human authority around or above. Some  of these were modelled after the Mexican Alcaldeship,"]]]
