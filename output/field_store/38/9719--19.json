Commence with the knife in the center of one hind foot and slit up the  inside of the leg, up to and around the vent and down the other leg in a  like manner. Cut around the vent, taking care not to cut the lumps or  glands in which the musk of certain animals is secreted; then strip the  skin from the bone of the tail with the aid of a split stick gripped  firmly in the hand while the thumb of the other hand presses against the  animal's back just above. Make no other slits in the skin, except in the  case of the skunk or otter, whose tails require to be split, spread, and  tacked on a board.    Turn the skin back over the body, leaving the pelt side out and the fur  side inward, and by cutting a few ligaments, it will peel off very  readily. Care should be taken to cut closely around the nose, ears and  lips, so as not to tear the skin.    The beaver and raccoon should be skinned open; that is, ripped up the  belly from vent to chin after the following manner: Cut across the hind  leg as if to be \"cased\" and then rip up the belly. The skin can then be  removed by flaying as in skinning a beef.    Many inexperienced trappers stretch coon skins too long and draw out the  head and neck. This can be avoided. Coon can be cased but most dealers  prefer to have them stretched open.    You should have about three sizes of stretching boards for mink and fox.  For mink they should be 4-1/2 inches down to 3 inches and for fox from  6-1/4 inches down to 5 inches wide; in length the fox boards may be 4  feet and the mink boards 3 feet.    The boards should taper slightly down to within 8 inches of the end for  fox, and then rounded up to a round point. The mink boards should be  rounded at 4 or 5 inches from this point. You will vary the shape of the  board in proportion to the width. Stretching boards should not be more  than 3/8 inch thick. Have the boards smooth and even on the edges. Other  stretching boards should be made in proportion to the size and shape of  the animal whose skin is to be stretched.    You should not fail to remove all the fat and flesh from the skin  immediately after the skin is on the board. If a skin is wet when taken  from the animal, it should be drawn lightly on a board until the fur is  quite dry. Then turn the skin flesh side out and stretch.    Do not dry skins at a fire nor in the sun, nor in smoke. It often burns  them, when they will not dress and are of no value. Dry in a  well-covered shed or tent where there is a free circulation of air, and  never use any preparation, such as alum and salt, as it only injures  them for market. Never stretch the noses out long, as some trappers are  inclined to do, but treat them as above described, and they will command  better values. Fur buyers and dealers are inclined to class long nosed  skins as \"southern\" and pay a small price for them, as southern skins  are so much lighter than those of the north, in fur.    Foxes of the various kinds should be cased and put on boards fur side in  for a few days, or until dry. As the pelt is thin, they soon dry, when  they must be taken off and should be turned fur side out. In shipping,  see that they are not packed against furs flesh side out.    Skunk should be cased fur side in, and stretched on boards for several  days. The white stripe cut out, blackened, etc., reduces the value.    Mink should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several  days or until dry.    Muskrat should be stretched fur side in, and a few days on the board  will be sufficient. They are left as taken off, that is, fur side in.  Cut the tails off when skinning--they are worthless.    Opossum are stretched on boards fur side in and are left in that  condition after removing the boards. Cut the tails off when  skinning--they have no value.    Raccoon should be stretched open (ripped up the belly), and nailed on  boards or the inside of a building. Some dealers allow as much for coons  cased, from any section, while others prefer that only Southern coon, if  any, be cased.    Otter are cased and stretched fur side in. The pelt being thick and  heavy, takes several days to dry properly. They are shipped flesh side  out.    Beaver are split but stretched round and should be left in the hoop or  stretcher for several days.          CHAPTER XIII.    DEER FARMING.      This chapter is from Farmers' Bulletin 330, issued July 28, 1908, by  United States Department of Agriculture and written by D. E. Lantz,  Assistant, Biological Survey.    The term \"deer\" is here used in its general sense, in which it includes  the elk, the reindeer or caribou, the moose and other species, besides  those usually referred to as deer.                             U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,                           BUREAU OF BIOLOGICAL SURVEY,                           _Washington, D. C., June 3, 1908._         SIR: I have the honor to transmit the accompanying       manuscript on the subject of Deer Farming in the United       States, and to recommend its publication as Farmers'       Bulletin No. 330. As a result of the growing scarcity of       game animals in this country the supply of venison is wholly       inadequate to the demand, and the time seems opportune for       developing the industry of deer farming, which may be made       profitable alike to the state and the individuals engaged       therein. The raising of venison for market is as legitimate       a business as the growing of beef and mutton, and state       laws, when prohibitory, as many of them are, should be so       modified as to encourage the industry. Furthermore, deer and       elk may be raised to advantage in forests and on rough,       brushy ground unfitted for either agriculture or stock       raising, thus utilizing for profit much land that is now       waste. An added advantage is that the business is well       adapted to landowners of small means.                             Respectfully,                             C. HART MERRIAM,                           _Chief Biological Survey._                             HON. JAMES WILSON,                          _Secretary of Agriculture._      INTRODUCTION.    The present bulletin discusses briefly the economic possibilities of  raising deer and elk in the United States. It is believed that when the  restrictions now imposed by State laws are removed this business may be  made an important and highly profitable industry, especially since it  will be the means of utilizing much otherwise unproductive land. The  raising of venison should be, and is naturally, as legitimate a business  as the growing of beef or mutton, and State laws should be so modified  as to permit the producer, who has stocked a preserve with deer at  private expense, to dispose of his product at any time, under reasonable  regulations, either for breeding purposes or for food.    The growing scarcity of game mammals and birds in the United States and  the threatened extinction of some of them over large parts of their  present ranges make the preservation of the remnant highly important.  Very important also is the increase of this remnant so as to make game  once more abundant. It is believed that by means of intelligent game  propagation, both by the states and by private enterprise, many of our  depleted ranges can be restocked with big game.      IMPORTANCE OF THE DEER FAMILY.    The members of the deer family (Cervidae) rank next to the cattle and  sheep family (Bovidae) in general utility, and are the most important of  the big game animals of America.    Wherever obtainable in quantity the flesh of deer of different kinds has  always been a staple article of diet, and under present market  conditions it is hardly necessary to say that venison is perhaps the  most important game, being a favorite with epicures and also having a  wide use as a substitute for beef and mutton, which meats it resembles  in texture, color, and general characteristics. Its flavor is  distinctive, though it suggests mutton rather than beef. In chemical  composition it is very similar to beef, though, judging from available  data, it is not so fat as stall-fed cattle. The following figures show  how it compares with beef and mutton: A lean venison roast before  cooking has been found to contain on an average 75 per cent of water, 20  per cent of protein or nitrogenous material, and 2 per cent of fat; a  lean beef rump, some 65 to 70 per cent of water, 20 to 23 per cent of  protein, and 5 to 14 per cent of fat; a lean leg of mutton, 67 per cent  of water, 19 per cent of protein, and 13 per cent of fat.    Venison, beef, and other common meats are very thoroughly digested,  whatever the method of cooking. Venison may be roasted, broiled,  pan-broiled, or used for making stews, in much the same way as beef.  Venison, particularly steak, to be at its best, should be eaten as soon  as possible after it is cooked.    The general popularity of venison is so great and the demand for it so  widespread that over-production is improbable. The other products of the  deer--skins and horns--are of considerable importance, and in countries  where deer are abundant and especially where large herds are kept in  semi-domestication, the commerce in both is very extensive.      THE DOMESTICATION OF DEER.    A number of species of the deer family have been proved to be  susceptible to domestication. The reindeer, however, is the only one  that has been brought fully under the control of man. The fact that the  European red deer and the fallow deer have been bred in parks for  centuries without domestication does not prove that they are less  susceptible to the process than the reindeer. The purposes for which  they have been held captive and the environment given them have been  markedly different. It must be remembered, also, that few attempts have  been made to rear and domesticate deer under intelligent management. The  work has been largely a matter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#16)"],[1,"stated by Duncan to be  \"light green, with brown and white longitudinal stripes; head reddish.\"    The _butterfly_ appears in August and September. A few years ago it was  esteemed a rare insect, but it has since been found in plenty in some of  the following localities, the list of which would doubtless be largely  added to by further research in the northern hilly districts, its chosen  haunts.    Near Edinburgh; near Minto, in Roxburghshire; Isle of Arran; Braemar; near  Newcastle; Castle Eden Dene; Durham; Craven; Wharfedale. {107}    At Grange, in North Lancashire, this \"rarity\" is a common garden butterfly,  according to Mr. C. S. Gregson.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MOUNTAIN RINGLET BUTTERFLY. (_Erebia Cassiope._)    (Plate VI. fig. 5.)    A few years ago this little butterfly was esteemed one of the greatest of  British rarities. The first well authenticated specimens were discovered  and captured in Westmoreland by that distinguished artist, T. Stothard,  R.A.; then for several years no more were taken, and the very existence of  the butterfly in Britain was questioned. Since that time, however, its  peculiar haunts among the mountains of Cumberland and Westmoreland have  been rediscovered, and great numbers have been captured by various  collectors. It is only found in very elevated situations, flying about the  moist, springy spots that abound on these mountain sides, and in many spots  the insect is very plentiful, within a limited range.    Mr. Curtis says, \"They only fly when the sun shines, and their flight is  neither swift nor continued, for they frequently alight among the grass,  and falling down to the roots, their sombre colour perfectly conceals  them.\"    The following notice of their locality, &c. from {108} personal  observation, is quoted from a communication to the _Intelligencer_, by a  well-known entomologist, Mr. R. S. Edleston, of Manchester. He says:--    \"I and my friend, Mr. Hugh Harrison, in the middle of June made the ascent  to Sty Head Tarn; for the first time in my experience, the weather was  everything we could desire--calm and sunshine; this, combined with the dry  season of last year and the long drought for months during this, enabled us  to collect on ground in other years a dangerous morass. The result was, we  captured _Cassiope_ in abundance, some of them in superb condition, just  emerged from the chrysalis. A very short time on the wing suffices to  injure them. They vary considerably in the development of the black spots  on the fulvous patch, almost obsolete in some through all gradations to the  fullest development; the patch varies in like manner, and also in form;  lastly, they vary in size.\"    The caterpillar is yet _unknown_.    The _butterfly_ has the wings above of a dark brown colour. Each wing bears  near its extremity a bar of deep but dull red, divided into sections where  the brown veins cross. In each section is usually a black spot, but  sometimes these are absent, and a few red spots take the place of the bar.  The hind wings are smoothly rounded in their outline, and not toothed or  scalloped as in the last species (_Blandina_). The _males_ generally appear  towards the end of June, but a few sometimes earlier. The females, however,  come later. {109} being found in July, and some even as late as August. The  following localities for it are recorded:--Rannoch, Perthshire; Lake  District; Sty Head Tarn; Langdale Pikes; Red Skrees Mountains, near  Ambleside; Gable Hill. But other stations for it will probably be added to  our list in time.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MARSH RINGLET, OR SMALL RINGLET BUTTERFLY. (_Coenonympha Davus._)    (Plate VI. fig. 6.)    This species, which is another North-country butterfly, varies so much in  its colouring of sober drab or brown, with black eye-spots, that its  varieties have been described as distinct species under the names of _C.  Polydama_, _Typhon_, and _Iphis_, now, however, all placed together under  the name of _Davus_.    These variations appear to depend in great measure upon local differences  of elevation, latitude, &c.    From this excessive variability also it is very difficult to give a clear  _general_ description of the markings, though the insect may be  distinguished from other British species that approach it in appearance by  the obscure yellowish-drab tint of the upper surface, marked with  indistinct eye-spots, and more especially by having on the under surface of  the hind wings an _irregular_ {110} _whitish_ band across the centre, and  outside of this a row of about six clearly defined black eye-spots with  white centres, situated each in a pale ochreous ring.    The _butterfly_, which appears in June and July, is exclusively met with in  the North (including North Wales), and inhabits the moors and marshy  heaths, or \"mosses,\" in a great many localities in Scotland and the  northern counties. The following are among those recorded:--    SCOTLAND.--Shetland Isles; Isle of Arran; Pentland Hills; Ben Nevis; Ben  Lomond, near Oban; Ben More.    ENGLAND.--Lake District of Cumberland; Yorkshire; Beverley; Cottingham;  Hatfield Chase; Thorne Moor; White Moss, Trafford Moss, Chat Moss, near  Manchester; Chartly Park, near Uttoxeter; Delmere Forest, Cheshire; between  Stockport and Ashton; near Cromer, in Norfolk; near Glandford Brigg,  Lincolnshire.    IRELAND.--Donegal mountains.    NORTH WALES.--Between Bala and Ffestiniog.    Ashdown Forest, in Sussex, has been given as a locality, on doubtful  authority, certainly; but from what I have seen and know of that district  and its productions, I think it is not at all impossible that _Davus_ may  be really found there. We have there, at any rate, the heath-covered, yet  swampy, moorlands that the insect loves, and also in plenty the plants one  finds most abundant in the northern moorlands; such {111} as Vacciniums,  Cotton-grasses, the three common Heaths, &c. &c. with great variety in the  elevation, some of the ground lying very high.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SMALL HEATH BUTTERFLY. (_Coenonympha Pamphilus._)    (Plate VI. fig. 7.)    This is the pretty little tawny-coloured butterfly that mixes with the  sportive group of \"Blues,\" Meadow Browns, &c. on heaths, downs, and grassy  fields.    The general colour of the upper surface is a tawny yellow or buff, shaded  with a darker tint of brown at the edges and at the bases of the hind  wings. On the under side it may be distinguished from _C. Davus_ by the  _absence of the clearly defined black eye-spots_ which the latter has. It  is usually much inferior in size to the last.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on the common grasses, is of a bright  apple-green colour, with three darker green stripes bordered with a whitish  tint, the largest stripe being that on the back.    The _butterfly_ abounds all over the country, from June till September.           *       *       *       *       *    {112}    THE WHITE ADMIRAL. (_Limenitis Sybilla._)    (Plate VII. fig. 1.)    This elegant butterfly is one of those in which the choicest ornamentation  is bestowed upon the _under_ surface, to the comparative neglect of the  upper. Above, a dark sepia-brown tint, banded and spotted with white, is  all that greets the eye; but beneath there is a piece of the most  exquisitely harmonious colouring, though the hues that compose it are still  of a subdued and secondary nature;--silvery blue, and golden brown blended  with a cooler brown and black, are placed in vivacious contrast with bands  and spots of pure silvery white.    The _caterpillar_ (Plate I. fig. 4), which feeds on the Honeysuckle, is a  pretty and singular looking creature; general colour bright green, with  reddish branched spines, and white and brown side-stripes.    The _chrysalis_ (Plate I. fig. 21) is also a very beautiful and curious  object, very knobby and angular, of dark green general colour, and  ornamented with _bright silver_ spots and stripes.    The _butterfly_ is found from the end of June till the end of July; its  favourite resorts being oak-woods in the southern counties. {113}    Localities:--Colchester; Epping; Hartley Wood, near St. Osyth, Essex; near  Rye, and in other parts of Sussex; at several places in Kent; near  Winchester; and in Black Park, where Dr. Allchin informs me he took a large  number in one day.    The superlatively graceful motions of this butterfly on the wing, as it  comes floating and sailing through the wood openings, have long been  celebrated; and the story has been often quoted from Haworth, of the old  fly-fancier, who, long after he had become too feeble and stiff-jointed to  pursue or net a butterfly, used to go and sit on a stile which commanded a  well-known resort of his favourite _Sybilla_, and there, for hours  together, would he feast his eyes on the sight of her inimitably elegant  evolutions.           *       *       *       *       *    THE PURPLE EMPEROR. (_Apatura Iris._)    (Plate VII. fig. 2.)    By universal suffrage, the place of highest rank among the butterflies of  Britain has been accorded to this splendid insect, who merits his imperial  title by reason of his robe of royal purple, the lofty throne he assumes,  and the boldness and elevation of his flight.    A glimpse of this august personage on the wing is enough to fire the  collector with enthusiastic ambition {114} for his capture; sometimes a  matter of the easiest accomplishment, sometimes just as hopelessly  impossible, according to his majesty's humour of the moment.    Cowardice is not one of his attributes, and if he has formed a preference  for any especial spot, he will risk loss of liberty and life rather than  forsake it.    The old mode of capturing this prize was by a ring net fixed at the end of  a pole some twenty or thirty feet long, and so sweeping him off as he sat  on his leafy throne, or in one of his evolutions when he"]]]
