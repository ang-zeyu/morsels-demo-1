FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 4: It must be remembered that this is ten or twelve years ago  though it holds good down to 1876. Since the railway was made more  colonists have come into the district, and two fine new steamers now ply  on the Kaipara waters.]          CHAPTER V.    OUR SHANTY.      Several years ago now, we bought our land from the Maoris, and settled  down here upon the Pahi. Necessarily, our first proceeding was to  construct a habitation. We might have employed the carpenter and  boat-builder, who resides at the township, to put up a good and  well-made frame-house for us, for a price of a hundred pounds or  upwards. But we had entire confidence in our own abilities, and besides,  there was something enticing in the idea of building our future home  with the actual labour of our own hands.    Moreover, there was another reason, possibly of chief importance: we  could not afford to pay for a house. After paying for our land, paying  for our farm-stock, and calculating our resources for meeting the  current expenses of the first year or two, we found there was but slight  margin for anything else; therefore we decided to build a shanty  ourselves. Meantime, we were camped on our new estate in a manner more  picturesque than comfortable. A rude construction of poles covered with  an old tarpaulin sufficed us. It was summer weather, and this was quite  good enough for a beginning. From step to step, that is the way to  progress, so we said. First the tent or whare, temporarily for a few  weeks; then the shanty, for a year or two; then, as things got well with  us, a well-finished frame-house; finally, a palace, a castle in the air,  or anything you like.    There are shanties and shanties. It is necessary to explain. Primarily,  in its Canadian and original sense, the term means a log-house--a hut  made of rough squared logs, built up upon each other. Such log-huts are  not common in this country, though they may be seen here and there. The  mild climate does not require such a style of building. The labour of  cutting and squaring logs for the purpose is great. The native whare of  thatch is quickly and easily raised, serves all requirements, and lasts  for years. In most parts hitherto settled, water-communication places  the settler within reach of a saw-mill, where he can obtain boards and  so on at very moderate cost. A shanty here, is a name applied to almost  any kind of nondescript erection, which would not come under the  designation of whare, or be honoured by the ambitious title of house.  Rough edifices of planking are the common form.    We went up to Tokatoka on the Wairoa, and there we purchased enough sawn  timber for our purpose, for about twelve or fifteen pounds. We hired a  big punt, and fetched this stuff down to our place, a distance of some  forty miles or so by water. Then we set to work at building.    The site we selected was an ambitious one; too much so, as we were  afterwards to discover. From the first Old Colonial objected to it. It  was too far from the river, he said, and would necessitate such an  amount of \"humping.\" Bosh about humping! returned the majority. It was  only a temporary affair; in a year or two we should be having a regular  frame-house. Old Colonial gave way, for he perceived that, as our  acknowledged boss, he would have but little of the humping to do  himself. And the chosen site was central for the first proposed  clearings of our future farm.    The selected spot was a rising ground in the centre of a broad basin,  nearly a mile across. Steep ranges surround this basin, and the whole  was then covered with light bush. Half a mile in front is a mangrove  swamp, beyond which flows the river--the mangroves filling up a space  that without them would have been an open bay. The prospect in this  direction is bounded by the forest-clothed ranges on the opposite side  of the river, which is here about a mile in breadth. The land within the  basin is nothing like level, and English farmers might be frightened at  its ruggedness. To colonial eyes, however, it seems all that could be  desired.    Knolls and terraces gradually lead up to the ranges, which sweep away to  run together into a high hill called Marahemo, about three miles behind  us. The little eminence, on which stands the shanty, slopes down on the  left to a flat, where originally flax and rushes did most abound.  Through this flat a small creek has channelled a number of little ponds  and branches on its way to the river beyond.    On the right the bank is steeper, and upon it stand a number of  cabbage-tree palms. Down below is a little rocky, rugged gully, with a  brawling stream rushing through it. Just abreast of the shanty this  stream forms a cascade, tumbling into a pool that beyond is still and  clear and gravelly. It is a most romantically beautiful spot, shaded and  shut in completely by fern-covered rocks and overhanging trees. This is  our lavatory. Here we bathe, wash our shirts, and draw our supplies of  water. This creek flows down through the mangrove swamp to the river;  and, at high-water, we can bring our boats up its channel to a point  about a quarter of a mile below the shanty.    The site of the shanty has its advantages; but it has that one serious  drawback foreseen by Old Colonial. Somehow or other, year after year has  flown by, and still we have not got that frame-house we promised  ourselves. It is not for want of means, or because we have not been  quite so rapidly successful as we anticipated. Of course not! Away with  such base insinuations! But we have never any time to see about it, and  are grown so used to the shanty that we do not seem to hanker after  anything more commodious. So all these years, we have had to hump on our  backs and shoulders every blessed thing that we have imported or  exported, from the shanty to the water, or the contrary--sacks of flour,  sugar, and salt, grindstones, cheeses, meat, furniture. Oh, misery! how  our backs have ached as we have toiled up to our glorious site, while  Old Colonial laughed and jeered, as his unchristian manner is.    Our work began with the timbers of the shanty itself, and with the heavy  material for the stockyard. But humping was then a novelty, and we  regarded it as a labour of love. Now we know better, and, when we do get  that frame-house, we are going to have it just as near to the  landing-place as we can possibly stick it. You may bet your pile on  that!    Of course, in building the shanty, we employed the usual fashion  prevalent in the colony. Because, when we set to work we said we were  going to build a proper frame-house, _not_ a shanty. That is a name for  our habitation, which has since grown up into usage. We were none of us  practised carpenters; but what did that matter? We knew how to use our  hands; and had so often seen houses built that we knew precisely how to  do it.    First of all, then, are the piles. These are of puriri wood, tough,  heavy, and durable. They are rough-split sections of the great logs,  some two feet thick, with squarely-sawn ends. They are fixed in the  ground two or three feet apart, so as to bring their flat-sawn tops upon  a uniform level. The irregularities of the ground are thus provided  against, while a suitable foundation is laid.    The next process is to build a scaffolding, or skeleton frame, of  scantling and quartering. When that has been done, the floor is planked  over, the sides weather-boarded, doors, windows, and partitions being  put in according to the design of the architect. Lastly, the roof is  shingled, that is, covered with what our chum, O'Gaygun, calls \"wooden  slates.\"    Our shanty is thirty feet long by ten in width. The sides are seven feet  high, and the ridge-pole is double that height from the floor. There are  a door and two windows, the latter having been bought at the township.  There is a partition across the shanty, two rooms having originally been  intended; but as this partition has a doorway without a door, and is  only the height of the sides, being open above, the original intention  in raising it has been lost, and it now merely serves for a convenient  rack. There is no verandah on the outside of the shanty, for we regarded  that as a waste of material and labour.    The fireplace is an important part of the shanty. Ten feet of the side  opposite the door was left open, not boarded up. Outside of this a sort  of supplementary chamber, ten feet square, was boarded up from the  ground. The roof of this little outroom slopes away _from_ that of the  rest of the shanty, and at its highest point a long narrow slit is left  open for a chimney. There is no flooring to this chamber, the ground  being covered with stones well pounded down. Its level is necessarily  sunk a little below that of the shanty floor, which is raised on the  piles, so the edge of the flooring forms a bench to sit on in front of  the fire. The fire used simply to be built up on the stones, in the  middle of this chimney-place; but, after a year or two, we imported an  American stove, with its useful appliances, from Auckland.    Our shanty is the habitation of some half-dozen of us, year out and year  in. There are in the district a good many settlers of the  middle-classes. Men of some education, who would be entitled to the  designation of \"gentleman\" in Europe. Of such sort are we. Some of us  are landowners, and some have no capital, being simply labourers.

BIRCH WINE. The season for obtaining the liquor from birch trees, is in  the latter end of February or the beginning of March, before the leaves  shoot out, and as the sap begins to rise. If the time be delayed, the  juice will grow too thick to be drawn out. It should be as thin and  clear as possible. The method of procuring the juice is by boring holes  in the trunk of the tree, and fixing in facets made of elder; but care  should be taken not to tap it in too many places at once, for fear of  injuring the tree. If the tree is large, it may be bored in five or six  places at once, and bottles are to be placed under the apertures to  receive the sap. When four or five gallons have been extracted from  different trees, cork the bottles very close, and wax them till the wine  is to be made, which should be as soon as possible after the sap has  been obtained. Boil the sap, and put four pounds of loaf sugar to every  gallon, also the rind of a lemon cut thin; then boil it again for nearly  an hour, skimming it well all the time. Into a cask that will contain  it, put a lighted brimstone match, stop it up till the match is burnt  out, and then pour the liquor into it as quickly as possible. When  nearly cold, work it with a toast spread with yeast, and let it stand  five or six days, stirring it two or three times a-day. Put the bung  lightly in till it has done working; then close it down, and let it  stand two or three months. The wine may then be bottled, and will be fit  for use in about a week. It makes a rich and salutary cordial, and its  virtues are much relied on in consumptive and scorbutic cases.      BISCUIT CAKE. One pound of flour, five eggs well beaten and strained,  eight ounces of sugar, a little rose or orange flower water. Beat the  whole thoroughly, and bake it one hour.      BISCUITS. To make hard biscuits, warm two ounces of butter in as much  skimmed milk as will make a pound of flour into a very stiff paste. Beat  it with a rolling pin, and work it very smooth. Roll it thin, and cut it  into round biscuits. Prick them full of holes with a fork, and about six  minutes will bake them.--For plain and very crisp biscuits, make a pound  of flour, the yolk of an egg, and some milk, into a very stiff paste.  Beat it well, and knead it quite smooth; roll the paste very thin, and  cut it into biscuits. Bake them in a slow oven till quite dry and  crisp.--To preserve biscuits for a long time sweet and good, no other  art is necessary than packing them up in casks well caulked, and  carefully lined with tin, so as to exclude the air. The biscuits should  be laid as close as possible; and when it is necessary to open the cask,  it must be speedily closed again with care. Sea bread may also be  preserved on a long voyage, by being put into a bag which has been  previously soaked in a quantity of liquid nitre, and dried. This has  been found to preserve the biscuits from the fatal effects of the wevil,  and other injurious insects, which are destructive to this necessary  article of human sustenance.      BITTERS. Bruise an ounce of gentian root, and two drams of cardamom  seeds together: add an ounce of lemon peel, and three drams of Seville  orange peel. Pour on the ingredients a pint and half of boiling water,  and let it stand an hour closely covered: then pour off the clear  liquor, and a glass of it taken two or three times a day will be found  an excellent bitter for the stomach.--Or slice an ounce of gentian root,  and add half a dram of snakes' root bruised, half a dram of saffron,  three quarters of a dram of cardamom seeds, and the same of cochineal  bruised together, and the peel of three Seville oranges. Steep the  ingredients in a pint of brandy fourteen days, shaking them together  frequently; then strain the tincture through a piece of muslin, and a  tea-spoonful in a glass of wine may be taken two or three times a day.      BLACK BUTTER. Boil a pound of moist sugar with three pounds of  gooseberries, currants, raspberries, and cherries, till reduced to half  the quantity. Put it into pots covered with brandy paper, and it will be  found a pleasant sweetmeat.      BLACK CAPS. Divide and core some fine large apples, put them in a  shallow pan, strew white sugar over, and bake them. Boil a glass of  wine, the same of water, and sweeten it for sauce. Or, take off a slice  from the stalk end of some apples, and core without paring them. Mix  with grated lemon, and a few cloves in fine powder, as much sugar as  will sweeten them. Stuff the holes as close as possible with this, and  turn the flat end down on a stewpan; set them on a very slow fire, with  some raisin wine and water. Cover them close, and now and then baste  them with the liquor: when done enough, black the tops with a  salamander.      BLACK INK. Infuse in a gallon of rain or soft water, a pound of blue  galls bruised, and keep it stirring for three weeks. Then add four  ounces of green copperas, four ounces of logwood chips, six ounces of  gum arabac, and a glass of brandy.--To make ink of a superior quality,  and fit for immediate use, prepare the following ingredients. Four  ounces of blue galls, two ounces of chipped logwood, two of sulphate of  iron, one ounce and a half of gum arabac, half an ounce of sulphate of  copper, and half an ounce of brown sugar. Boil the galls and logwood in  six pints of spring or distilled water, until nearly three pints of  water are evaporated, then strain it through a piece of flannel. Powder  the salts in a mortar, dissolve the gum in a little warm water, then mix  the whole together, and shake it frequently for two or three days;  during which time expose it to the air, and it will become blacker.  Decant the liquor into stone bottles well corked, and it will be fit for  use directly. Those who wish to avoid the trouble of such a process,  will find an excellent substitute in Walkden's Ink Powder ready  prepared, with directions how to use it. If a cup of sweet wort be added  to two papers of the powder, it will give it the brightness of japan  ink.      BLACK LEAD. The best preparation for cleaning cast-iron stoves is made  of black lead, mixed with a little common gin, or the dregs of port  wine, and laid on the stove with a piece of linen rag. Then with a clean  brush, not too hard, and dipped in some dried black lead powder, rub the  stove till it comes to a beautiful brightness. This will produce a much  finer black varnish on the cast-iron, than either boiling the black lead  with small beer and soap, or mixing it with white of egg, as is commonly  practised.      BLACK PAPER, for drawing patterns, may easily be made in the following  manner. Mix and smooth some lamp-black and sweet oil, with a piece of  flannel. Cover a sheet or two of large writing paper with this mixture,  then dab the paper dry with a rag of fine linen, and prepare it for  future use by putting the black side on another sheet of paper, and  fastening the corners together with a small pin. When wanted to draw,  lay the pattern on the back of the black paper, and go over it with the  point of a steel pencil. The black paper will then leave the impression  of the pattern on the under sheet, on which you must now draw it with  ink. If you draw patterns on cloth or muslin, do it with a pen dipped in  a bit of stone blue, a bit of sugar, and a little water, mixed smooth in  a tea cup, in which it will be always ready for use.      BLACK PUDDINGS. The pig's blood must be stirred with a little salt till  it is cold. Put a full quart of it to a quart of whole grits, and let it  stand all night. Soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather more than  two quarts of new milk made hot. In the meantime prepare the guts by  washing, turning and scraping, with salt and water, and changing the  water several times. Chop fine a little winter savoury and thyme, a good  quantity of pennyroyal, pepper and salt, a few cloves, some allspice,  ginger and nutmeg. Mix these all together, with three pounds of beef  suet, and six eggs well beaten and strained. Have ready some hog's fat  cut into large bits; and as the skins are filling with the pudding, put  in the fat at intervals. Tie up in links only half filled, and boil in a  large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they will burst. When  boiled, lay them between clean cloths till cold, and hang them up in the  kitchen. When to be used, scald them a few minutes in water; wipe, and  put them into a Dutch oven. If there be not skins enough, put the  stuffing into basins, and boil it covered with floured cloths. Slice and  fry it when used.--Another way is, to soak all night a quart of bruised  grits in as much boiling-hot milk as will swell them, and leave half a  pint of liquid. Chop a quantity of pennyroyal, savoury and thyme; add  salt and pepper, and allspice finely powdered. Mix the above with a  quart of the blood, prepared as before directed; clean the skins  thoroughly, half "]]]
