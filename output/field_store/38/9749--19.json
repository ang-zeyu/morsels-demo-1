And when we say  that the cats have under their charge, according to the season of the  year, from one to three or four hundred thousand empty corn sacks, it  will be admitted that the company cannot have many servants who better  earn their wages.    \"The holes in the sacks, which are eaten by the rats which are not  killed by the cats, are darned by twelve women, who are employed by the  company.\"    Few people know, or wish to know, what a boon to mankind is \"The  Domestic Cat.\" Liked or disliked, there is the cat, in some cases  unthought of or uncared for, but simply kept on account of the  devastation that would otherwise take place were rats and mice allowed  to have undivided possession. An uncle of mine had some hams sent from  Yorkshire; during the transit by rail the whole of the interior of one  of the largest was consumed by rats. More cats at the stations would  possibly have prevented such irritating damage.    And further, it is almost incredible, and likewise almost unknown, the  great benefit the cat is to the farmer. All day they sleep in the barns,  stables, or outhouses, among the hay or straw. At eve they are seen  about the rick-yard, the corn-stack, the cow and bullock yards, the  stables, the gardens, and the newly sown or mown fields, in quest of  their natural prey, the rat and mouse. In the fields the mice eat and  carry off the newly-sown peas or corn, so in the garden, or the ripened  garnered corn in stacks; but when the cat is on guard much of this is  prevented. Rats eat corn and carry off more, kill whole broods of  ducklings and chickens in a night, undermine buildings, stop drains, and  unwittingly do much other injury to the well-being of the farmers and  others. What a ruinous thing it would be, and what a dreadfully horrible  thing it is to be overrun with rats, to say nothing of mice. In this  matter man's best friend is the cat. Silent, careful, cautious, and  sure, it is at work, while the owner sleeps, with an industry, a will,  and purpose that never rests nor tires from dewy eve till rosy morn,  when it will glide through \"the cat hole\" into the barn for repose among  the straw, and when night comes, forth again; its usefulness scarcely  imagined, much less known and appreciated.    They who remember old Fleet Prison, in Farringdon Street, will scarcely  believe that the debtors there confined were at times so neglected as to  be absolutely starving; so much so, that a Mr. Morgan, a surgeon of  Liverpool, being put into that prison, was ultimately reduced so low by  poverty, neglect, and hunger, as to catch mice by the means of a cat for  his sustenance. This is stated to be the fact in a book written by Moses  Pitt, \"The Cries of the Oppressed,\" 1691.    [Illustration]          GENERAL MANAGEMENT.    FEEDING.      Adult cats require less food in proportion than kittens, for two  reasons. One is this: a kitten is growing, and therefore extra bone,  flesh, skin, hair, and all else has to be provided for; while in the  adults, these are more or less acquired, and also they procure for  themselves, in various ways in country or suburban localities, much live  and other food, and no animal is the better for over or excessive  feeding, especially if confined, or its chances of exercise contracted.    I have tried many ways or methods of feeding, biscuits of sorts, liver,  lights, horseflesh, bread and milk, rice, fish, and cat mixtures, but  have always attained the best results by giving new milk as drink, and  raw shin of beef for food, with grass, boiled asparagus stems,  cabbage-lettuce, or some other vegetable, either cooked or fresh. Good  horseflesh is much liked by the cat, and it thrives well on it. I do not  believe in either liver or lights as a flesh or bone maker. Besides the  beef, there are the \"tit-bits\" that the household cat not only usually  receives, but looks for or expects.    My dear friend, Mr. John Timbs, in \"Things not Generally Known,\" avers  that cats are not so fond of fish as flesh, and that the statement that  they are is a fallacy. He says, put both before them and they will take  the flesh first, and this I have found to be correct. I should only give  fresh fish, as a rule, to a cat when unwell, more as an alternative than  food.    As raw meat or other raw food is natural to the cat, it is far the best,  with vegetables, for keeping the body, coat, and skin in good condition  and health, and the securing of a rich, bright, high colour and quality.  On no account try to improve these by either medicinal liquids, pills,  or condiments; nothing can be much worse, as reflection will prove. If  the cat is healthy, it is at its best, and will keep so by proper food;  if unwell, then use such medicines as the disease or complaint it  suffers from requires, _and not otherwise_. Many horses and other  animals have their constitutions entirely ruined by what are called  \"coat tonics,\" which are useless, and only believed in and practised by  the thoughtless, gullible, and foolish. Does any one, or will any one  take pills, powders, or liquids, for promoting the colour or texture of  their hair; would any one be so silly? And yet we are coolly told to  give such things to our animals. Granted that in illness medicine is of  much service, in health it is harmful, and tends to promote disease  where none exists.      SLEEPING PLACES.    I much prefer a round basket filled with oat straw to anything else;  some urge that a box is better; my cats have a basket. It is well to  sprinkle the straw occasionally with Keating's Powder or flour of  sulphur, which is a preventive of insect annoyances, and \"Prevention is  better than cure.\"    Never shut cats up in close cupboards for the night, there being little  or no ventilation; it is most injurious, pure air being as essential to  a cat as to a human being.    Always have a box with dry earth near the cat's sleeping place, unless  there is an opening for egress near.    Do not, as a rule, put either collar or ribbon on your cat; though they  may thereby be improved in appearance, they are too apt to get entangled  or caught by the collar, and often strangulation ensues; besides which,  in long-haired cats, it spoils their mane or frill. Of course at shows  it is allowable.    All cats, as well as other animals, should have ready access to a pan of  clear water, which should be changed every day, and the pan cleaned.    Fresh air, sunlight, and warm sunshine are good, both for cats and their  owners.    It is related of Charles James Fox that, walking up St. James's Street  from one of the club-houses with the Prince of Wales, he laid a wager  that he would see more cats than the Prince in his walk, and that he  might take which side of the street he liked. When they reached the top,  it was found that Mr. Fox had seen thirteen cats, and the Prince not  one. The Royal personage asked for an explanation of this apparent  miracle. Mr. Fox said: \"Your Royal Highness took, of course, the shady  side of the way as most agreeable; I knew the sunny side would be left  for me, and _cats always prefer the sunshine_.\"    A most essential requisite for the health of the cat is cleanliness. In  itself the animal is particularly so, as may be observed by its constant  habit of washing, or cleaning its fur many times a day; therefore, a  clean basket, clean straw, or clean flannel, to lie on--in fact,  everything clean is not only necessary, but is a necessity for its  absolute comfort.    Mr. Timbs says: \"It is equally erroneous that she is subject to fleas;  the small insect, which infests the half-grown kitten, being a totally  different animal, exceedingly swift in running, but not salient or  leaping like a flea.\"    In this Mr. Timbs slightly errs. Cats _do_ have fleas, but not often,  and of a different kind to the ordinary flea; but I have certainly seen  them jump.    In dressing the coat of the cat no comb should be used, more especially  with the long-haired varieties; but if so, which I do not recommend,  great care should be used not to drag the hair so that it comes out, or  breaks, otherwise a rough, uneven coat will and must be the result.    Should the hair become clotted, matted, or felted, as is sometimes the  case, it ought to be moistened, either with oil or soft-soap, a little  water being added, and when the application has well soaked in, it will  be found comparatively easy to separate the tangle with the fingers by  gently pulling out from the mass a few hairs at a time, after which wash  thoroughly, and use a soft, long-haired brush; but this must be done  with discretion, so as not to spoil the natural waviness of the hair, or  to make it lie in breadths instead of the natural, easy,  carelessly-parted flaky appearance, which shows the white or blue cat  off to such advantage.      WASHING.    Most cats have a dislike to water, and as a rule, and under ordinary  conditions, generally keep themselves clean, more especially the  short-haired breeds; but, as is well known, the Angora, Persian, and  Russian, if not taken care of, are sure to require washing, the more so  to prepare them for exhibition, as there is much gain in the condition  in which a cat comes before the judge.    There are many cases of cats taking to the water and swimming to certain  points to catch fish, or for other food, on record; yet it is seldom  that they take a pleasure in playing about in it. I therefore think it  well to mention that I had a half-bred black and white Russian, that  would frequently jump into the bath while it was being filled, and sit  there until the water rose too high for its safety. Thus cats may be  taught to like washing.    If a cat is to be washed, treat it as kindly and gently as is possible,  speaking in a soothing tone, and in no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#16)"],[1,"_\" claims to have perpetuated the  system called \"Christianity,\" while, at the same time, it declares,  that the miraculous gifts of the Spirit have ceased.    With as much propriety it might be contended, that the magnet had been  perpetuated, but had lost its magnetic properties; that water was  perpetuated with all its virtues, but had lost its power to quench  thirst, or seek its own level; that fire was still fire, but had lost  its heat.    How, we inquire, can Christianity have been perpetuated, while its  virtues, its legitimate powers, its distinguishing features, its very  life and essence have ceased from among men? Or, of what possible use  is it if it does exist? Is a compass of use when its needle has lost  its magnetic attraction? Is water of use when it no longer seeks its  level, or quenches thirst? Is fire of use when it loses its heat? Is a  sun dial of use in a dark and cloudy day; or, a watch without a  mainspring?    Or, are the mere forms and ceremonies of any system of use, when the  divine, or legitimate powers, for which such forms were instituted,  are withdrawn?    O man! be no longer deceived by solemn mockeries of things sacred, or  by great and holy names applied to corrupt and degenerate systems.    When the miracles and gifts of the divine Spirit ceased from among  men, Christianity ceased, the Christian ministry ceased, the Church of  Christ ceased.    That ministry which sets aside modern inspiration, revelation,  prophecy, angels, visions, healings, &c., is not ordained of God; but  is Anti-Christian in spirit. In short, it is that spirit of  priestcraft and kingcraft, by which the world, for many ages, has been  ruled as with a rod of iron.    The sooner the present generation lose all reverence and respect for  modern \"_Christianity_,\" with all its powerless forms and solemn  mockeries, the sooner they will be prepared to receive the kingdom of  God. The sooner the treasuries of nations, and the purses of  individuals, are relieved from the support of priestcraft and  superstitions, so much sooner will they be able and willing to devote  their means and influence to print and publish the glad tidings of the  fulness of the Gospel, restored in this age, to assist in the  gathering of the house of Israel, and in the building of the cities  and temples of Zion and Jerusalem.          CHAPTER XII.    ANGELS AND SPIRITS.          Boast not your lightning wires to bear the news,      Such tardy means the Saints would never choose;      Too slow your fluid, and too short your wires      For heavenly converse, such as love inspires.      If man would fain commune with worlds above,      Angels transport the news on wings of love.        \"_Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for      them who shall be heirs of salvation?_\" Heb. i. 14.    Angels are of the same race as men. They are, in fact, men who have  passed from the rudimental state to the higher spheres of progressive  being. They have died and risen again to life, and are consequently  possessed of a divine, human body of flesh and bones, immortal and  eternal. They eat, drink, sing and converse like other men. Some of  them hold the keys of Apostleship and Priesthood, by which they teach,  instruct, bless, and perform miracles and many mighty works.  Translated men, like Enoch, Elijah, John the Apostle, and three of the  Apostles of the Western Hemisphere, are also like the angels.    Angels are ministers, both to men upon the earth, and to the world of  spirits. They pass from one world to another with more ease, and in  less time than we pass from one city to another. They have not a  single attribute which man has not. But their attributes are more  matured, or more developed, than the attributes of men in this present  sphere of existence.    Whenever the keys of Priesthood, or, in other words, the keys of the  science of Theology, are enjoyed by man on the earth, the people thus  privileged, are entitled to the ministering of angels, whose business  with men on the earth, is to restore the keys of the Apostleship, when  lost; to ordain men to the Apostleship, when there has been no  Apostolic succession; to commit the keys of a new dispensation; to  reveal the mysteries of history; the facts of present or past times;  and to unfold the events of a future time. They are, sometimes,  commissioned also to execute judgments upon individuals, cities or  nations. They can be present in their glory, or, they can come in the  form and appearance of other men. They can also be present without  being visible to mortals.    When they come as other men, they will perhaps eat and drink, and wash  their feet; and lodge with their friends. Hence, it is written--\"_Be  not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have  entertained angels unawares_.\"    Their business is, also, to comfort and instruct individual members of  the Church of the Saints; to heal them by the laying on of hands in  the name of Jesus Christ, or to tell them what means to use in order  to get well; to teach them good things, to sing them a good song, to  warn them of approaching danger, or, to deliver them from prison, or  from death.    These blessings have always been enjoyed by the people, or Church of  the Saints, whenever such Church has existed on our planet. They are  not peculiar to one dispensation more than another.    They were busy in the Patriarchal dispensation, in the Mosaic, and in  the Gospel dispensations. They delivered Lot and destroyed Sodom.    They were busy with Moses and the Prophets. They foretold to Zechariah  the birth of John. They predicted to Mary her conception, and the  birth of Jesus Christ. They informed Joseph, her husband, of her  situation. They announced the birth of Jesus to the shepherds of  Judea, and sang an anthem of peace on earth and good will to man, to  hail him welcome. They attended on his footsteps, in all his sojourn  on the earth. In fact, an angel was the instrument to open the gloomy  prison of the sepulchre, and to call forth the sleeping body of the  Messiah, the first to exclaim, \"He is not here, but is risen.\" Two  angels in white raiment, were the first to announce his second advent,  while he ascended up in the presence of his disciples. Thus, being  delivered from the personal attendance on their Master on the earth,  they turned their attention to the Apostles, opened the way for their  ministry among Jew and Gentile, delivering them from prison and from  danger, and revealing the mysteries which God saw fit to make known to  the Saints of that age. And when all the other Apostles had fallen  asleep, and the Apostle John had been banished, to dig in the coal  mines of the lone isle of Patmos, they still were faithful to their  charge. They followed him there, and there unfolded to him the events  of all ages and generations.    The darkness of the middle ages; the corruptions of Anti-Christ, under  the name of Christianity; the rivers of blood, and the oceans of  tears, which would flow during eighteen centuries of error; the mighty  angel who should again commit the Gospel to the earth, for every  nation, kindred, tongue, and people; the judgments of God, in the  downfall of error and mystery; the restitution or restoration of the  Church of the Saints; their final triumph and dominion over the earth;  the descent of Jesus Christ to reign over all kingdoms; the  resurrection of the Saints, and their reign over the earth; the end of  death, and sorrow, and tears, and weeping; were all, _all_ foretold by  the angel to the last of the Twelve.    Again, in the present age, have angels restored the Gospel. Again have  they committed the keys of Apostleship. Again have they opened some of  the events of the past, present, and future.    Again have they attended upon the footsteps of Apostles, Prophets, and  holy Martyrs, from the cradle to the grave. Again have they aided in  the ministry, and assisted to deliver from prisons, and from  persecutions and death, the Saints of the Most High. And again are  they about to execute vengeance on great and notable cities and  nations of the earth.    O what an unspeakable blessing is the ministry of angels to mortal  man! What a pleasing thought, that many who minister to us, and watch  over us, are our near kindred--our fathers who have died and risen  again in former ages, and who watch over their descendants with all  the parental care and solicitude which characterize affectionate  fathers and mothers on the earth.    Thrice happy are they who have lawful claim on their guardianship, and  whose conduct does not grieve them, and constrain them to depart from  their precious charge.    SPIRITS are those who have departed this life, and have not yet been  raised from the dead.    These are of two kinds, viz.--Good and evil.    These two kinds also include many grades of good and evil.    The good spirits, in the superlative sense of the word, are they who,  in this life, partook of the Holy Priesthood, and of the fulness of  the Gospel.    This class of spirits minister to the heirs of salvation, both in this  world and in the world of spirits. They can appear unto men, when  permitted; but not having a fleshly tabernacle, they cannot hide their  glory. Hence, an unembodied spirit, if it be a holy personage, will be  surrounded with a halo of resplendent glory, or brightness, above the  brightness of the sun.    Whereas, spirits not worthy to be glorified will appear without this  brilliant halo; and, although they often attempt to pass as angels of  light, there is more or less of darkness about them.    Many spirits of the departed, who are unhappy, linger in lonely  wretchedness about the earth, and in the air, and especially about  their ancient homesteads, and the places rendered dear to them by the  memory of former scenes. The more wicked of these are the kind spoken  of in Scripture, as \"_foul spirits_,\" \"_unclean"]]]
