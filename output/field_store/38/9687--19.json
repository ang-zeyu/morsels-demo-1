In Copenhegan, as Andersen himself told me, all the children know him.  \"And,\" he said, with such a countenance that showed such homage was  dearer to him than the more splendid honors paid as tributes to his  genius, \"as I walk along the street, the little darlings nod and kiss  their hands to me; and they say to one another, 'There's Andersen!'  and then some more run and wave their hands. Oh yes, they all know me.  But sometimes, if there be one who does not, then, perhaps, his mamma  will say, 'Look, that is he who wrote the story you read the other  day, and that you liked so much;' and so we soon get acquainted.\" And  _this_ popularity delights him more than anything; and you surely  cannot call it vanity.    In the account he has written of his life, he relates a circumstance  that happened to him at Dresden; and it is so pretty that I insert it  here. He writes: \"An evening that for me was particularly interesting  I spent with the royal family, who received me most graciously. Here  reigned the same quiet that is found in private life in a happy  family. A whole troop of amiable children, all belonging to Prince  John, were present. The youngest of the princesses, a little girl who  knew that I had written the story of 'The Fir-tree,' began familiarly  her conversation with me in these words: 'Last Christmas we also had a  fir-tree, and it stood here in this very room.' Afterwards, when she  was taken to bed earlier than the others, and had wished her parents  and the king and queen 'Good night,' she turned round once more at the  half-closed door, and nodded to me in a friendly manner, and as though  we were old acquaintance. I was her prince of the fairy tale.\"    But it is not the praise of the great, or the admiration of a court,  on which he sets most value, as you will see by the following extract  from a letter which I received from him to-day, only an hour or two  ago. It is about his stay in England, and his visit to the north,  after I had left him, and I am sure he will not mind my sharing thus  much of what he writes to me with you. \"The hearty welcome I met with  in Scotland moved me greatly. My writings were so well known, I found  so many friends, that I can hardly take in so much happiness. But I  must relate you one instance: in Edinburgh I went with a party of  friends to Heriot's Hospital, where orphan children are taken care of  and educated. We were all obliged to inscribe our names in the  visitors' book. The porter read the names, and asked if that was  Andersen the author: and when some one answered 'Yes,' the old man  folded his hands and gazed quite in ecstacy at an old gentleman who  was with us, and said: 'Yes, yes! he is just as I had always fancied  him to myself--the venerable white hair--the mild expression--yes,  that is Andersen!' They then explained to him that I was the person.  'That young man!' he exclaimed; 'Why generally such people, when one  hears about them, are either dead or very old.' When the story was  told me, I at first thought it was a joke; but the porter came up to  me in a most touching manner, and told me how he and all the boys  entered so entirely and heartily into my stories. It so affected me  that I almost shed tears.\"    This is indeed popularity!    Now I dare say you thought that the little princes and princesses in a  king's palace had tastes and feelings very different from a poor  charity-boy; but you see, although so different in rank, they were  alike in one thing--they were both children; and childhood, if left to  itself, is in all situations the same.    And do you know, too, my little friends, that you are very excellent  critics? Yes, most sage and excellent critics; though I dare say not  one of you even ever dreamt of such a thing. But it is, nevertheless,  true; and not some, but all of you, whether in England, Scotland, or  Ireland--the little boys in Heriot's Hospital, and the little princess  at Dresden who knew the story of \"The Fir-Tree.\" For without one  dissentient voice you have passed favorable judgment on these stories:  in your estimation of them your were unanimous.    Yet when they first appeared in Denmark some of the critics by  profession found fault with them, and wondered, as they said, how an  author who had written works of greater pretension, could think of  making his appearance with something so childish as these tales. And  some kind friends, grown-up people, whose opinion was not unimportant,  advised him by all means to give up writing such stories as he had no  talent for them; and it was only later, that, to use Andersen's own  words, \"every door and heart in Denmark was open to them.\" But all of  you, not critics by profession, you welcomed them at once; as soon as  you saw them you perceived their beauty--you cherished and gave them a  place in your heart. And this is the reason why I say that you are  sage and excellent critics; and if you can preserve the same  simple-heartedness, finding pleasure in what is natural and truthful,  and allow yourselves to be guided by the instincts of your pure  uncorrupted nature, you may always be so.    You will like to know that Thorwaldsen, the great Thorwaldsen, loved  to hear Andersen repeat these tales. It is true he has quite a  peculiar way of relating them, which adds greatly to their charm. I  begged him one day to tell me the story of \"The Top and Ball,\" and he  immediately sat down on the sofa and began. Though I knew it by heart  from beginning to end, so often had I read it over, yet it now seemed  quite new, from his manner of telling it; and I was as amused and  laughed as much as though I had never heard it before. That very  pretty one, \"Ole Luckoie,\" was written when in the society of  Thorwaldsen; and \"often at dusk,\" so Andersen relates, \"when the  family circle were sitting in the summer house, would Thorwaldsen  glide gently in, and, tapping me on the shoulder, ask, 'Are we little  ones to have no story tonight?' It pleased him to hear the same story  over and over again; and often, while employed on his grandest works,  he would stand with a smiling countenance and listen to the tale of  'Top and Ball,' and 'The Ugly Duck.'\" The last is my favorite also.    From Rome, where this occurred, you must now take a jump with me to  Hamburg; for I have to tell you an anecdote that happened there to  Andersen, also, about his stories which he relates in his \"Life.\" He  had gone to see Otto Speckter, whose clever and characteristic  pictures most of you will certainly know, and he intended to go  afterwards to the play. Speckter accompanied him. \"We passed an  elegant house. 'We must first go in here, my dear friend,' said he; 'a  very rich family lives there, friends of mine, friends of your tales;  the children will be overjoyed--' 'But the opera,' said I. 'Only for  two minutes,' he replied, and drew me into the house, told my name,  and the circle of children collected round me. 'And now repeat a  story,' he said: 'only a single one.' I did so, and hurried to the  theatre. 'That was a strange visit,' I said. 'A capital one! a most  excellent one!' shouted he. 'Only think! the children are full of  Andersen and his fairy tales: all of a sudden he stands in the midst  of them, and relates one himself, and then he is gone--vanished. Why,  that very circumstance is a fairy tale for the children, and will  remain vividly in their memory.' It amused me too.\"    You will be getting impatient, I am afraid. However, before I finish I  must tell you something about the stories in this volume. The  translation of them I had begun in Andersen's room, and when he came  in we began talking about them, one of which, \"The Little Girl with  the Matches,\" I had read in his absence. I told him how delighted I  was with it--that I found it most exquisitely narrated; but that how  such a thing came into his head, I could not conceive. He then said,  \"That was written when I was on a visit at The Duke of Augustenburg's.  I received a letter from Copenhagen from the editor of a Danish  almanac for the people, in which he said he was very anxious to have  something of mine for it, but that the book was already nearly  printed. In the letter were two woodcuts, and these he wished to make  use of, if only I would write something to which they might serve as  illustrations. One was the picture of a little match-girl, exactly as  I have described her. It was from the picture that I wrote the  story--wrote it surrounded by splendor and rejoicing, at the castle of  Grauenstein, in Schleswig.\"    \"And Little Tuk,\" said I.--\"Oh! 'Little Tuk,'\" answered he, laughing;  \"I will tell you all about him. When in Oldenburg I lived for some  time at the house of a friend, the Counsellor von E***. The children's  names were Charles and Gustave (Augusta?) but the little boy always  called himself 'Tuk.' He meant to say 'Charles,' but he could not  pronounce it otherwise. Now once I promised the dear little things  that I would put them in a fairy tale, and so both of them appeared,  but as poor children in the story of 'Little Tuk.' So you see, as  reward for all the hospitality I received in Germany, I take the  German children and make Danes of them.\"    You see he can make a story out of anything. \"They peep over his  shoulder,\" as he once wrote to me, a long time ago. And one time, when  he was just going to set off on a journey, his friend said to him, \"My  little Erich possesses two leaden soldiers, and he has given one of  them to me for you, that you may take it with you on your travels.\"    Now I should not at all wonder if this were the very \"Resolute Leaden  Soldier\" you read of in the \"**Tales From Denmark**;\" but this one, it  is true, was a Turk, and I don't think the other was.

There was a click of locks, the clanking of chains, and  the creaking of rusty hinges. The great doors swung open, and a crowd of  expectant faces received us in the Holy City.      [Illustration: RIDING BEFORE THE GOVERNOR AT MESHED.]    Meshed claims our attention chiefly for its famous dead. In its sacred  dust lie buried our old hero Haroun al Raschid, Firdousi, Persia's  greatest epic poet, and the holy Imaum Riza, within whose shrine every  criminal may take refuge from even the Shah himself until the payment of a  blood-tax, or a debtor until the giving of a guarantee for debt. No  infidel can enter there.      [Illustration: FEMALE PILGRIMS ON THE ROAD TO MESHED.]    Meshed was the pivotal point upon which our wheel of fortune was to turn.  We were filled with no little anxiety, therefore, when, on the day after  our arrival, we received an invitation to call at the Russian  consulate-general. With great ceremony we were ushered into a suite of  elegantly furnished rooms, and received by the consul-general and his  English wife in full dress. Madame de Vlassow was radiant with smiles as  she served us tea by the side of her steaming silver samovar. She could  not wait for the circumlocution of diplomacy, but said: \"It is all right,  gentlemen. General Kuropatkine has just telegraphed permission for you to  proceed to Askabad.\" This precipitate remark evidently disconcerted the  consul, who could only nod his head and say, \"_Oui, oui_,\" in affirmation.  This news lifted a heavy load from our minds; our desert journey of six  hundred miles, therefore, had not been made in vain, and the prospect  brightened for a trip through the heart of Asia.      [Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE AT MESHED.]    Between the rival hospitality of the Russian and English consulates our  health was now in jeopardy from excess of kindness. Among other social  attentions, we received an invitation from Sahib Devan, the governor of  Khorassan, who next to the Shah is the richest man in Persia. Although  seventy-six years of age, on the day of our visit to his palace he was  literally covered with diamonds and precious stones. With the photographer  to the Shah as German interpreter, we spent half an hour in an interesting  conversation. Among other topics he mentioned the receipt, a few days  before, of a peculiar telegram from the Shah: \"Cut off the head of any one  who attempts opposition to the Tobacco Regie\"; and this was followed a few  days after by the inquiry, \"How many heads have you taken?\" A retinue of  about three hundred courtiers followed the governor as he walked out with  feeble steps to the parade-ground. Here a company of Persian cavalry was  detailed to clear the field for the \"wonderful steel horses,\" which, as  was said, had come from the capital in two days, a distance of six hundred  miles. The governors extreme pleasure was afterward expressed in a special  letter for our journey to the frontier.      [Illustration: WATCH-TOWER ON THE TRANSCASPIAN RAILWAY.]      [Illustration: GIVING A \"SILENT PILGRIM\" A ROLL TOWARD MESHED.]    The military road now completed between Askabad and Meshed reveals the  extreme weakness of Persia's defense against Russian aggression. Elated by  her recent successes in the matter of a Russian consul at Meshed, Russia  has very forcibly invited Persia to construct more than half of a road  which, in connection with the Transcaspian railway, makes Khorassan almost  an exclusive Russian market, and opens Persia's richest province to  Russia's troops and cannon on the prospective march to Herat. At this very  writing, if the telegraph speaks the truth, the Persian border-province of  Dereguez is another cession by what the Russians are pleased to call their  Persian vassal. In addition to its increasing commercial traffic, this  road is patronized by many Shiah devotees from the north, among whom are  what the natives term the \"silent pilgrims.\" These are large stones, or  boulders, rolled along a few feet at a time by the passers-by toward the  Holy City. We ourselves were employed in this pious work at the close of  our first day's journey from Meshed when we were suddenly aroused by a  bantering voice behind us. Looking up, we were hailed by Stagno Navarro,  the inspector of the Persian telegraph, who was employed with his men on a  neighboring line. With this gentleman we spent the following night in a  telegraph station, and passed a pleasant evening chatting over the wires  with friends in Meshed.    Kuchan, our next stopping-place, lies on the almost imperceptible  watershed which separates the Herat valley from the Caspian Sea. This  city, only a few months ago, was entirely destroyed by a severe  earthquake. Under date of January 28, 1894, the American press reported:  \"The bodies of ten thousand victims of the awful disaster have already  been recovered. Fifty thousand cattle were destroyed at the same time. The  once important and beautiful city of twenty thousand people is now only a  scene of death, desolation, and terror.\"    From this point to Askabad the construction of the military highway speaks  well for Russia's engineering skill. It crosses the Kopet Dagh mountains  over seven distinct passes in a distance of eighty miles. This we  determined to cover, if possible, in one day, inasmuch as there was no  intermediate stopping-place, and as we were not a little delighted by the  idea of at last emerging from semi-barbarism into semi-civilization. At  sunset we were scaling the fifth ridge since leaving Kuchan at daybreak,  and a few minutes later rolled up before the Persian custom-house in the  valley below. There was no evidence of the proximity of a Russian  frontier, except the extraordinary size of the tea-glasses, from which we  slaked our intolerable thirst. During the day we had had a surfeit of  cavernous gorges and commanding pinnacles, but very little water. The only  copious spring we were able to find was filled at the time with the  unwashed linen of a Persian traveler, who sat by, smiling in derision, as  we upbraided him for his disregard of the traveling public.      [Illustration: AN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL KUROPATKINE AT THE RACES NEAR    ASKABAD.]    It was already dusk when we came in sight of the Russian custom-house, a  tin-roofed, stone structure, contrasting strongly with the Persian mud  hovels we had left behind. A Russian official hailed us as we shot by, but  we could not stop on the down-grade, and, besides, darkness was too  rapidly approaching to brook any delay. Askabad was twenty-eight miles  away, and although wearied by an extremely hard day's work, we must sleep  that night, if possible, in a Russian hotel. Our pace increased with the  growing darkness until at length we were going at the rate of twelve miles  per hour down a narrow gorge-like valley toward the seventh and last ridge  that lay between us and the desert. At 9:30 P. M. we stood upon its  summit, and before us stretched the sandy wastes of Kara-Kum, enshrouded  in gloom. Thousands of feet below us the city of Askabad was ablaze with  lights, shining like beacons on the shore of the desert sea. Strains of  music from a Russian band stole faintly up through the darkness as we  dismounted, and contemplated the strange scene, until the shriek of a  locomotive-whistle startled us from our reveries. Across the desert a  train of the Transcaspian railway was gliding smoothly along toward the  city.      [Illustration: MOSQUE CONTAINING THE TOMB OF TAMERLANE AT SAMARKAND.]    A hearty welcome back to civilized life was given us the next evening by  General Kuropatkine himself, the Governor-General of Transcaspia. During  the course of a dinner with him and his friends, he kindly assured us that  no further recommendation was needed than the fact that we were American  citizens to entitle us to travel from one end of the Russian empire to the  other.    From Askabad to Samarkand there was a break in the continuity of our  bicycle journey. Our Russian friends persuaded us to take advantage of the  Transcaspian railway, and not to hazard a journey across the dreaded  Kara-Kum sands. Such a journey, made upon the railroad track, where water  and food were obtainable at regular intervals, would have entailed only a  small part of the hardships incurred on the deserts in China, yet we were  more than anxious to reach, before the advent of winter, a point whence we  could be assured of reaching the Pacific during the following season.  Through the kindness of the railway authorities at Bokhara station our car  was side-tracked to enable us to visit, ten miles away, that ancient city  of the East. On November 6 we reached Samarkand, the ancient capital of  Tamerlane, and the present terminus of the Transcaspian railway.      [Illustration: CARAVANSARY AT FAKIDAOUD.]      [Illustration: A MARKET-PLACE IN SAMARKAND, AND THE RUINS OF A    COLLEGE.]                                                IV                         THE JOURNEY FROM SAMARKAND TO KULDJA      On the morning of November 16 we took a last look at the blue domes and  minarets of Samarkand, intermingled with the ruins of palaces and tombs,  and then wheeled away toward the banks of the Zerafshan. Our four days'  journey of 180 miles along the regular Russian post-road was attended with  only the usual vicissitudes of ordinary travel. Wading in our Russian  top-boots through the treacherous fords of the \"Snake\" defile, we passed  the pyramidal slate rock known as the \"Gate of Tamerlane,\" and emerged  upon a strip of the Kizil-Kum steppe, stretching hence in painful monotony  to the bank of the Sir Daria river. This we crossed by a rude rope-ferry,  filled at the time with a passing caravan, and then began at once to  ascend the valley of the Tchirtchick toward Tashkend. The blackened cotton  which the natives were gathering from the fields, the lowering snow-line  on the mountains, the "]]]
