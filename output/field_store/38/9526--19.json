And in the morning there was a cockleshell of a boat  oared in by one of the men who had found it downriver.    They had ferried and crossed well into the dusk of the evening. And at  the first dawn they were at it again. Drew tried to remember how many  times he had made that trip, swimming or rowing, always with some mount  as his special charge. More than half the company had sworn they could  not swim, and so the burden of the transfer fell upon their fellows.    \"Rennie--\" That was Campbell climbing up from the raft after another  weary passage across. \"There's trouble on the other side. You've been  using that mule of yours to get some of the horses over, haven't you?\"    Drew was so tired that words were too much trouble to shape. He nodded  dully. Pryor had been right about Hannibal. The big mule had not only  taken his own passage across the Tennessee as a matter-of-course  proceeding, but had shouldered and urged along three horses as he went.  And twice since then Drew had taken him back and forth to bring in  skittish mounts causing trouble.    \"That horse of mine's running wild; he broke out of the water twice.\"  The captain caught at Drew's bare arm so hard his nails cut. \"Think you  could get him over with the mule's help?\"    Drew wavered a little as he walked slowly to where he had picketed  Hannibal after their last trip. He was tired, and although he had eaten  earlier that morning, he was hungry again. It was warm and the sun was  climbing, but the air felt chill against his naked body and he shivered.  The one thing they were all getting out of this river business, Drew  decided, were much-needed baths.    Kirby, his body white save for tanned face and throat, sun-darkened  hands and wrists, crouched on the raft as Drew brought Hannibal down to  that unwieldy craft.    \"Tryin' for the cap'n's hoss?\"    \"What's wrong with it?\" Drew helped the Texan push off.    \"Reaches no bottom, an' then it plain warps its backbone tryin' to paw  down the sky. Maybe that mule can git some sense into the loco critter.  But I'm not buyin' no chips on his doin' it.\"    Drew located Campbell's horse, a rangy, good-looking gray which reminded  him a little of the colt he had seen at Red Springs, snorting and  trotting back and forth along the path they had worn on the banks during  their efforts of the past twenty-four hours. One of the rear guard held  its lead rope and kept as far from the skittish animal as he could.    \"He's plumb mean,\" the guardian informed Drew. \"When he jumps, get out  from under--quick!\"    Yet when Drew, mounted on Hannibal now, brought the horse down to the  water's edge, the horse appeared to go willingly enough. The scout  tossed the lead rope to Kirby, waiting until the raft pushed off with  its load of men and fringe of horses, then took to the river beside  Campbell's horse. When they reached the deeper section he saw the gray  go into action.    Rearing, the horse appeared about to try to climb onto the raft. And the  man holding its lead rope dropped it quickly. Drew, swimming, one hand  on Hannibal's powerful shoulder, tried to guide the mule toward the  horse that was still splashing up and down in a rocking-horse movement.  But the mule veered suddenly, and Drew saw those threatening hoofs loom  over his own head. He pushed away frantically, but too late to miss a  numbing blow as one hoof grazed his shoulder.    Somehow, with his other hand outflung, he caught Hannibal's rope tail  and held on with all the strength he had left, while the water washed in  and out of a long raw gouge in the skin and muscles of his upper arm.          8    _Happy Birthday, Soldier!_      \"No water here either.\" Boyd climbed up the bank of what might once have  been a promising stream. Carrying three canteens, he ran the tip of his  tongue over his lips unhappily. \"It sure is hot!\"    They had turned off the road, which was now filled with men, horses,  men, artillery, and men, all slogging purposefully forward. They  composed an army roused out before daylight, on the move toward another  army holed in behind a breastworks and waiting. And over all, the  exhausting blanket of mid-July heat which pressed to squeeze all the  vital juices out of both man and animal.    Drew touched his aching arm soothingly. It still hurt, although the  rawness had healed during the weeks between that turbulent crossing of  the Tennessee and this morning in Mississippi as they moved at the Union  position on the ridge above the abandoned ghost town of Harrisburg. The  remnant of Morgan fugitives, some eighty strong, had fallen in with  General Bedford Forrest's ranging scouts at Corinth, and had ridden  still farther southward to join his main army just on the eve of what  promised to be a big battle.    \"Hot!\" echoed Kirby. \"A man could git hisself killed today an' never  know no difference.\"    They were reluctant to re-enter the stream progressing along the road.  The dust was ankle-deep there, choking thick when stirred by feet and  hoof to a powdery cloud. In contrast, there were no clouds in the sky,  and the sun promised to be a ball of brass very soon.    Yesterday had been as punishing. Men wilted in the road, overcome by  heat and lack of water. If there ever had been any moisture in this  country, it had long ago been boiled away. The very leaves were brittle  and grayish-looking where they weren't inches deep in dust.    As of last night, the Morgan men were an addition to Crossland's  Kentuckians under General Buford. The speech of the blue grass was  familiar, but nothing yet had made them a part of this new army with  which they marched.    Drew reached for one of the canteens. His worry over Boyd, dulled by the  passing of time, stirred sluggishly. The other had kept up the grueling  pace which had brought the fugitives across half of Kentucky, all of  Tennessee, and into this new eddy of war, making no complaint after his  first harsh introduction to action--which might be in part an adventure,  but which was mostly something to be endured--with the dogged  stubbornness of a seasoned veteran. And Boyd had manifestly toughened in  that process. After Drew's mishap in the river, Boyd had accepted  responsibility, helping to keep the scout in the saddle and riding, even  when Drew had been bemused by a day or two of fever, unaware of either  their enforced pace or their destination.    No, somewhere along the line of retreat Drew had stopped worrying about  Boyd. And now, with the youngster already appointed horse holder for the  day's battle, he need not think of him engulfed in action. Though any  fighting future was decided mainly by the capricious chance which struck  one man down and allowed his neighbor to march on unscathed.    \"You men--over there--close up!\" A officer, hardly to be distinguished  from the men he rode among, waved them back to the column. Then they  were dismounting. As Drew handed Hannibal over to Boyd's care, he was  glad again that the other was safely behind the battle line moving up in  the thin woods.    During the night the enemy had thrown together the breastworks on the  ridge, weaving together axed trees, timbers torn out of the abandoned  houses of the village--anything the Union leader could commandeer for  such use. And between that improvised fortification and the cover in  which the Confederates now waited was a section of open ground, varying  in width with the wanderings of a now dry river. Where the Kentuckians  were stationed, there must have stretched about three hundred yards of  that open, Drew estimated, and the woods bordering it on this side were  so thin that any charge would take them into plain sight for five  hundred yards of approach.    Fieldpieces brought into line on the woods side, hidden above by the  breastworks, opened up in a dull _pom-pom_ duel. Drew saw a shell strike  earth not far away, bounce twice, still intact, and roll on toward the  Confederate lines.    The _zip-zip_ of the Minies had not yet begun. And this waiting was the  hardest part of all. Drew tried to pin all his powers of concentration  on a study of the ground immediately before him, the slope up which they  would have to win in order to have it out with the now hidden enemy. He  made himself calculate just which path to take when the orders to charge  came. Although his arm prevented his using a carbine or rifle, his two  Colts were loaded, and one was in his hand. He glanced around.    Kirby? There was a Morgan trooper next--Drew tried to remember his name.  Laswell ... Townstead ... no, Clinton! Tom Clinton. He'd done picket  duty with Drew. And beyond Clinton--there was Kirby, his lips pulled  tight in what might have been a grin, but which Drew thought was not.  Then ... Boyd! But Boyd was back with the horses; he had to be!    Drew edged forward a little, trying to see better. If it were Boyd, he  had to wrench him out of that line and get the boy back. A hot emotion  close to panic boiled up in Drew.    Somewhere, through the pound of the artillery, a bugle blared. And  Drew's muscles obeyed that call, even as he still tried to see who was  fourth in line from him.    Slowly at first, they were on the move. The sun was up, shining directly  into their faces. But in spite of the glare, they could still see the  Union works and the flash of guns along it. They were moving faster,  coming to a trot. Officers shouted here and there, trying to slow that  steady advance--why?    Then, drowning out the bugles, the mutter and roar of the artillery,  came the Yell. Their shambling trot quickened. Men were running now,  forming a great wave to lick up at the breastworks. Men in that line did  not know--or care--that they were moving without the promised support on  right and left; they did not hear the disturbed orders of the officers  still striving to slow them, to wrench them back into a battle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#16)"],[1,"describes Ptolemy giving  Lucullus, on his landing at Alexandria, an emerald on which was  engraved his portrait. Pliny also relates how the short-sighted Nero  watched the fights of gladiators through an eye-glass made of an  emerald, and in ancient times, in Rome, Greece, and Egypt, eye-glasses  made of emeralds were much valued. Many of these, as well as engraved  and carved emeralds, have been discovered in ruins and tombs of those  periods.    The copper emerald is rare; it is a hydrous form of copper silicate,  CuOSiO_{2} + H_{2}O, of a beautiful emerald green, varying from  transparent to translucent. It exhibits double refraction, and is a  crystallised mineral, brittle, and showing a green streak. This is less  hard than the real emerald, is heavier, deeper in colour, and is usually  found in crystals, in cavities of a particular kind of limestone which  exists at Altyn-Tuebe, a hill in the Altai Mountains, in the Urals, and  in North and Central America.      _The Tourmaline._    The tourmaline is a most complex substance; almost every stone obtained  has a different composition, some varying but slightly, with mere traces  of certain constituents which other stones possess in a perceptible  degree. Consequently, it is not possible to give the chemical formula,  which might, and possibly would, be found but seldom, even in analyses  of many specimens. It will therefore be sufficient to state the average  composition, which is:--ferrous oxide, manganous oxide, potash, lime,  boracic acid, magnesia, soda, lithia, and water. These form, roughly  speaking, 25 per cent. of the bulk, the remainder being oxide of silicon  and oxide of aluminium in about equal parts. It crystallises in the 2nd  (hexagonal) system, with difficult cleavage and vitreous lustre.    It will naturally be expected that a substance of such complexity and  variety of composition must necessarily have a corresponding variety of  colour; thus we find in this, as in the corundum, a wonderful range of  tints. The common is the black, which is not used as a gem. Next come  the colourless specimens, which are not often cut and polished, whereas  all the transparent and coloured varieties are in great demand. To  describe adequately their characteristics with relation to light would  alone require the space of a complete volume, and the reader is referred  to the many excellent works on physics (optics) which are obtainable.  This stone is doubly refracting, exhibiting extremely strong dichroism,  especially in the blue and the green varieties. It polarises light, and  when viewed with the dichroscope shows a remarkable variety of twin  colours. It will be remembered that in Hogarth's \"Rake's Progress,\" the  youth is too engrossed in the changing wonders of a tourmaline to notice  the entrance of the officers come to arrest him.          CHAPTER XV.    VARIOUS PRECIOUS STONES--_continued_.      _Zircon._    Zircon appears to have been first discovered by Klaproth in 1789, in the  form of an earth, and six years later he found that the stone hyacinth  contained a similar substance, both having the formula, ZrSiO_{4}, and  both having as their colouring agent ferric oxide. There are several  methods of obtaining the metallic element, zirconium; it is however with  the silicate of zirconium that we have to deal at the moment. This is  called zircon, ZrSiO_{4}, or hyacinth when transparent or red, but when  smoke-coloured, or colourless, it is the jargoon, or jarcon, and is  found in silt and alluvial soils, limestone, gneiss, and various forms  of schist, in India, Australia, the Urals, and certain parts of America.  It is often combined with and found in juxtaposition to gold and certain  varieties of precious stones. The lines of cleavage are parallel to the  sides of the prism, and the crystals have an adamantine, or diamond  lustre, varying from the completely opaque to the transparent. In some  varieties the oxide of uranium is also present in traces. It  crystallises in the 3rd (tetragonal) system, with indistinct cleavage.  Its specific gravity varies from 4.70 to 4.88, according to the specimen  and the locality.    This stone, like some of the others described, has a very wide range of  colour, going through reds, browns, greens, yellows, oranges, whites,  greys, blues from light to indigo, notwithstanding which it is somewhat  difficult to imitate scientifically, though its composition of 33 per  cent. of silica with 67 per cent. of zirconia (the oxide of zirconium),  is practically all it contains, apart from the colouring matter, such as  the metallic oxides of iron, uranium, etc. Its hardness is 7-1/2,  consequently it is untouched by a file, and so far, if one or perhaps  two of the three qualities of colour, hardness, and specific gravity,  are obtained in a chemically made zircon, the third is wanting. Under  the blowpipe, zircons are infusible, but the coloured stones when heated  strongly become heavier, and as they are contracting, their colour  fades, sometimes entirely, which changes are permanent, so that as they  possess the adamantine lustre, they are occasionally cut like a diamond,  and used as such, though their deficiency in fire and hardness, and  their high specific gravity, make them readily distinguishable from the  diamond.    On exposure to light the coloured zircon becomes more or less  decoloured; especially is this so in sunlight, for when the direct rays  of the sun fall upon it, the colours fade, and for a moment or two  occasional phosphorescence follows, as is the case when the stone is  warmed or heated in a dark room. The stone appears to be very  susceptible to brilliant light-rays, and in certain specimens which were  split for testing, one half of each being kept excluded from light for  purposes of comparison, it was found that sunshine affected them most;  then brilliant acetylene gas, which was more effective still when tinted  yellow by being passed through yellow glass. The electric arc was not so  effective, but the electric light of the mercury-vapour lamp, though  causing little change at the first, after a few hours' exposure rapidly  bleached certain of the colours, whilst having no effect on others. Coal  gas with incandescent fibre mantle was slightly effective, whilst the  coal-gas, burned direct through an ordinary burner, affected very few of  the colours, even after twenty-four hours' exposure at a distance of  three feet. In all these cases, though the colours were slightly  improved by the stones being kept for a time in the dark, they failed to  recover their original strength, showing permanent loss of colour.      _The Silicates._    The chief of these are the garnets, crystallising in the cubic system,  and anhydrous. The garnet is usually in the form of a rhombic  dodecahedron, or as a trisoctahedron (called also sometimes an  icosatetrahedron), or a mixture of the two, though the stones appear in  other cubic forms. In hardness they vary from 6-1/2 to 8-1/2. They  average from 40 to about 42 per cent. of silica, the other ingredients  being in fairly constant and definite proportions. They are vitreous and  resinous in their lustre and of great variety of colour, chiefly amongst  reds, purples, violets, greens, yellows and blacks, according to the  colouring matter present in their mass. There are many varieties which  are named in accordance with one or more of their constituents, the best  known being: (A) The iron-alumina garnet, having the formula 6FeO,  3SiO_{2} + 2Al_{2}O_{3}, 3SiO_{2}. This is the \"precious\" garnet, or  almandine, sometimes called the \"Oriental\" garnet; these stones are  found in Great Britain, India, and South America, and are deep red and  transparent, of vitreous lustre. They get up well, but certain varieties  are so subject to defects in their substance, brought about by pressure,  volcanic action, and other causes, some of which are not yet known, that  their quality often becomes much depreciated in consequence. This  inferior variety of the iron-alumina garnet is called the \"common\"  garnet, and has little lustre, being sometimes opaque. The perfect  qualities, or almandine, as described above, are favourite stones with  jewellers, who mount great quantities of them.    The second variety is the (B) lime-iron garnet, formula, 6CaO,3SiO_{2} +  2Fe_{2}O_{3},3SiO_{2}. The chief of this class is the melanite,  sometimes dull, yet often vitreous; it is mostly found in volcanic  rocks, such as tuff; this variety is very popular with jewellers for  mourning ornaments, for as it is a beautiful velvet-black in colour and  quite opaque, it is pre-eminent for this purpose, being considerably  less brittle than jet, though heavier. Another variety is the  \"topazolite,\" both yellow and green. The \"aplome\" is greenish-yellow,  yellowish-green, brown, and usually opaque. A further form of lime-iron  garnet is the \"pyreneite,\" first found in the Pyrenees Mountains, hence  its name.    The (C) lime-chrome garnets--6CaO,3SiO_{2} + 2Cr_{2}O_{3}, 3SiO_{2}--the  chief of which is \"uwarowite.\" This is of a magnificent emerald green  colour, translucent at edges and of a vitreous lustre. When heated on  the borax bead it gives an equally beautiful green, which is, however,  rather more inclined to chrome than emerald. This is an extremely rare  stone in fine colour, though cloudy and imperfect specimens are often  met with, but seldom are large stones found without flaws and of the  pure colour, which rivals that of the emerald in beauty.    The fourth variety (D) is the lime-alumina garnet, its formula  being--6CaO,3SiO_{2} + 2Al_{2}O_{3},3SiO_{2}. Like the others, it has a  number of sub-varieties, the chief being the \"cinnamon stone,\" which is  one of great beauty and value when perfect. This stone is almost always  transparent when pure, which property is usually taken as one of the  tests of its value, for the slightest admixture or presence of other"]]]
