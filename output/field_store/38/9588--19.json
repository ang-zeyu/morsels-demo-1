When she had fed her  babies and preened her pretty feathers a bit, she was off again on the  ten-mile flight; for many a long journey she and her mate must take ere  their little ones could feed themselves. But ten miles over and over and  over again were as nothing to the love she had for her children; and  faithfully as she had brooded her eggs, she now began the task of  providing their meals. She seemed so happy each time she returned, that  perhaps she was a little bit worried while she was away; but there is no  reason to think she really was afraid that any great harm could come to  them.    Certainly she was unprepared for what she found when she flew back from  her fourth fishing trip. Even when she reached Heron Camp, she did not  understand. There are some things it is not given the mind of a bird to  know.    She could not know, poor dear, that there were people in the world who  coveted her beautiful wedding plumes. Women there were, who wished to  make themselves look better by wearing the feathers that Nature had  given snowy herons for their very own. And men there were, who thought  to make themselves grander in the dress of their organization by walking  about with heron plumes waving on their heads. The two kinds of white  herons with wonderful plumes that have been put to such uses are called  Egrets and Snowy Egrets, and the feathers, when they are stripped from  the birds, are called by the French name of _aigrette_.    Now, of course, Ardea could not know about this, or that the  Plume-Hunters had come to steal her wedding feathers. But she knew well  enough that danger was at hand, and that in times of trouble a mother's  place is beside her babies. Her heart beat quickly with a new terror,  but she stayed, the brave bird stayed! And all about her the other  herons stayed also. They had no way to fight for their lives, and they  might have flown far and safely on their strong wings; but none of them  would desert the home built with love while the frightened babies were  calling to their fathers and mothers.    No, _they_ could not fight for their lives, but there was one who could.  For danger did not come to Heron Camp without finding Ardea's Soldier at  his post.    Now the Plume-Hunters did not have bodies like crocodiles and leather  wings, you know; but they were dragons of a sort, for all that, for they  carried brutal things in their hands that belched forth smoke and pain  and death, and they were cruel of heart, and they had sold themselves to  do evil for the sake of the dollars that covetous men and women would  pay them for feathers.    Dragons though they were, Ardea's Soldier met them bravely. I like to  think how brave he was; for was not the fight he fought a fight for our  good old Mother Earth, that she might not lose those beautiful children  of hers? If the world should be robbed of Snowy Herons, it would be just  so much less lovely, just so much less wonderful. And have they no right  to life, since the same Power that gave life to men gave life to them?  And when we think about it this way, who seems to have the better right  to those plumes--herons, or men and women?    The Soldier believed in Ardea's right to life, believed in it so deeply  that he stood alone before the Plume-Hunters and told them that, while  he lived, the birds of his camp should also live.    And that is why they killed him--the dragons who were cruel of heart  and had sold themselves to do evil for the sake of dollars that covetous  men and women would pay for feathers.    Because of his courage and because of the cause for which he died, I  think, don't you, that Ardea's Soldier might well be called \"Knight of  the Snowy Heron.\"    I said that he was alone, and it is true that no one was there at the  camp to help him. But many there were in other places doing their bit in  the same good fight. Another soldier, named Theodore Roosevelt, did much  for these birds when he was President, by granting them land where no  man had a right to touch them; for it makes a true soldier angry when  the weak are oppressed, and he said, \"It is a disgrace to America that  we should permit the sale of aigrettes.\" Another man, named Woodrow  Wilson, whose courage also was so great that he always did what he  believed to be right, would not permit, when he was Governor of New  Jersey, a company to sell aigrettes in that State; he said, \"I think New  Jersey can get along without blood-money.\"    Many another great man, besides, served the cause of Ardea. So many, in  fact, that there is not room here to tell about them all. But there is  room to say that the children helped. For, you know, every Junior  Audubon Society sends money to the National Association of Audubon  Societies--not much, but a little; and when the Knight of the Snowy  Heron was killed, that little helped the National Association to hire  another soldier to take his place. Now, think of that! There was another  soldier who so believed in the Herons' right to life and plumage, that  he was ready to protect them though it meant certain danger to himself!    Yes, there is to this very day a soldier at Heron Camp. Do you know a  way to keep him safe? Why, you children of America can do it if you  will, and it need not cost one of you a penny. You can do it with your  minds. For if every girl makes up her mind for good and all that she  will never wear a feather that costs a bird its life; and if every boy  makes up his mind for good and all that he will never be a  feather-hunting dragon--why there will not be _anybody_ growing up in  America to harm Ardea, will there? You can keep the Soldier of Heron  Camp safe by just wishing it! That sounds wonderful as a fairy story  come true, does it not? And like the knight in some old fairy tale,  could not Ardea's new Soldier \"live happily forever after\"?          IX    THE FLYING CLOWN      There are many accounts of the flying clown, in books, nearly all of  which refer to him as bull-bat or nighthawk, and a member of the  Goatsucker or Nightjar family. But he wasn't a bull and he wasn't a bat  and he wasn't a hawk and he wasn't a jar; and he flew more by day than  by night, and he never, never milked a goat in all his life. So for the  purposes of this story we may as well give him a name to suit ourselves,  and call him Mis Nomer.    He was a poor skinny little thing, but you would not have guessed it to  see him; for he always wore a loose fluffy coat, which made him look  bigger and plumper than he really was. It was a gray and brown and  creamy buff-and-white sort of coat, quite mottled, with a rather plain,  nearly black, back. It was trimmed with white, there being a white  stripe near the end of the coat-tail, a big, fine, V-shaped white place  under his chin that had something the look of a necktie, and a bar of  white reaching nearly across the middle of each wing.    These bars would have made you notice his long, pointed wings if he had  been near you, and they were well worth noticing; for besides just  flying with them,--which was wonderful enough, as he was a talented  flier,--he used them in a sort of gymnastic stunt he was fond of  performing in the springtime.    Perhaps he did it to show off. I do not know. Certainly he had as good a  right to be proud of his accomplishments as a turkey or a peacock that  spreads its tail, or a boy who walks on his hands. Maybe a better right,  for they have solid earth to strut upon and run no risks, while Mis did  his whole trick in the air. It was a kind of acrobatic feat, though he  had no gymnasium with bars or rings or tight rope, and there was no  canvas stretched to catch him if he fell. A circus, with tents, and a  gate-keeper to take your ticket, would have been lucky if it could have  hired Mis to show his skill for money.    But Mis couldn't be hired. Not he! He was a free, wild clown, performing  only under Mother Nature's tent of wide-arched sky. If you wanted to see  him, you could--ticket or no ticket. That was nothing to him; for Mis,  the wild clown of the air, had no thought either of money or fame among  people.    Far, far up, he flew, hither and yon, in a matter-of-fact-enough way;  and then of a sudden, with wings half-closed, he dropped toward the  earth. Could he stop such speed, or must he strike and kill himself in  his fall? Down, down he plunged; and then, at last, he made a sound as  if he groaned a loud, deep \"boom.\"    [Illustration: _The Flying Clown._]    But just at the moment of this sound he was turning, and then, the first  anyone knew, he was flying up gayly, quite gayly. Then it wasn't a groan  of fear? Mis afraid! Why the rascal had but to move his wings this way  and that, and go up instead of down. He might be within a second of  dashing himself to death against the ground, but so sure were his wings  and so strong his muscles, that a second was time and to spare for him  to stop and turn and rise again toward the safe height from which he  dived. A fine trick that! The fun of the plunge, and then the quick jerk  at the end that sent the wind groaning against and between the feathers  of his wings, with a \"boom\" loud and sudden enough to startle anyone  within hearing.    Yes, you might have seen the little clown at his tricks without a ticket  at the wild-circus gate, for all he cared or knew. What did the children  of men matter to him? Had not his fathers and grandfathers and  great-grandfathers given high-air circus performances of a springtime,  in the days when bison and passenger pigeons inherited their full share  of the earth, before our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers  had even seen America?    Was it, then, just for the joy of the season that he played in the air,  or was there,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#16)"],[1,"deluge of books and pamphlets with which France is inundated?  They only contain the spirit of rebellion: the freedom of writing ought  not to be given to every body. There should be in a well-regulated state  seven or eight writers, not more; and these under the inspection of  government. Authors are the plague of France; you will see whither they  will lead it.\"    The king spoke this with an animated air, and if at this moment M. de la  Vrilliere had come to ask for a _lettre de cachet_ against a writer, the  king would not have refused it.    \"Besides,\" added the king, in a tone of less anger, but no less  emphatically, \"I see with pain that the police do not do their duty with  regard to all these indignities.\"    \"Yet,\" said the duc de Duras, \"M. de Sartines does wonders.\"    \"Then why does he tolerate such insults? I will let him know my  discontent.\"    The duc de Duras was alarmed, and kept his mouth closed. The king then,  resuming his gaiety, joked the two gentlemen on their secret intrigues:  then changing the conversation suddenly, he talked of the expected  arrival of the king of Denmark.    \"Duc de Duras,\" said he, \"you and your son must do the office of master  of ceremonies to his _Polar_ majesty. I hope you will endeavor to amuse  him.\"    \"Yes, sire.\"    \"Mind, what you undertake is no joke. It is no easy matter to amuse a  king.\"    This was a truth which I perceived at every moment, and our monarch  was not the one to be amused with trifling exertion. Frequently when  he entered my apartment he threw himself on an ottoman, and yawned most  excessively, yes, yawned in my company. I had but one mode of rousing  him from this apathy, but it was a sure one. I spoke of the high  magistracy and its perpetual resistance to the throne. Then the king  aroused, instantly sprung from his seat, traversed the room with rapid  strides, and declaimed vigorously against the _black gowns_; thus he  styled the parliaments. I confess, however, that I only had recourse to  the \"black gowns\" at the last extremity. Little did I think that at a  later period I should league myself against them. On the one hand, the  duc d'Aiguillon hated them mortally, and on the other, the comte Jean,  like a real Toulousian, would have carried them in his slippers; so that  wavering between the admiration of the one and the hatred of the other,  I knew not which to listen to, or which party to side with. But to  return to present matters.    The king was always thinking of the \"_ Nouvelles a la Main,_\" and  determined to avenge me as openly as I had been attacked. Two or three  days afterwards he gave a supper, to which he invited the duchesse and  comtesse de Grammont, madame de Forcalquier, the princess de Marsan, the  marechale de Mirepoix, and the comtesses de Coigny and de Montbarrey.  They were seated at table laughing and amusing themselves; they talked  of the pleasure of being to _themselves_, of having no _strangers_; they  pierced me with a hundred thrusts; they triumphed! And yet the king was  laughing in his sleeve. At a premeditated signal the duc d'Aiguillon,  one of the guests, asked his majesty if he had seen the comtesse du  Barry that day. This terrible name, thrown suddenly into the midst of my  enemies, had the effect of a thunder-clap. All the ladies looked at each  other first and then at the king, and the duc d'Aiguillon, reserving  profound silence. His majesty then replied, that he had not had the  happiness of visiting me that day, not having had one moment's leisure;  then eulogized me at great length, and ended by saying to the duke, \"If  you see the comtesse before I do, be sure to say that I drank this glass  of wine to her health.\"    The ladies did not anticipate this. The duchesse de Grammont  particularly, in spite of long residence at court, turned pale to her  very ears, and I believe but for etiquette she would have fallen into  a swoon. I learnt afterwards from the marechale de Mirepoix, that the  duchesse, on going home, gave herself up to a fit of rage, which did  not terminate even on the following day. When the king related this  occurrence to me, he was as proud of it as if he had done a most  courageous deed.    But I have omitted a day which was of great importance to me in  its consequences. I mean the day which followed that on which I had  complained to the duc de Duras of M. the lieutenant of police. In the  morning early my sister-in-law came into my room.    \"Sister,\" said she, \"comte Jean is here with M. de Sartines, who begs to  pay his respects to you. Will you receive him?\"    \"M. de Sartines! Yes, let him come in; I will treat him as he deserves.\"    Comte Jean then came in, preceded by the lieutenant of police: he wore  a large peruke with white powder, and curled with the utmost care. Wigs  were his mania, and he had a room filled from floor to ceiling with  these ornaments. The duc d'Ayen said, that he never should be in trouble  about the council of state, for in case of need, it might be found and  replenished from the house of the lieutenant of police. Let us leave  wigs and revert to M. de Sartines.    He appeared before me with the air of Tartuffe, and, forgive the phrase,  _en vrai capon_.    \"Madame,\" said he to me, \"I have been informed that I am in disgrace  with you, and have come to inquire how I may extricate myself from this  misfortune.\"    \"You ought to know, sir. Twice in one month have I been shamefully  insulted; and yet the first intimation of such a thing ought to have put  you on your guard.\"    M. de Sartines, whom my tone had much surprised, endeavored to justify  himself, when comte Jean said to him,    \"My dear lieutenant of police, all you have said goes for nothing. One  thing is certain, and that is, that there is a deficiency of respect  towards my sister-in-law. You say that it is not your fault: what proof  do you give us of this? What inquiries have you made? What measures have  you taken? Any? Why do you come to us if you aid our enemies?\"    M. de Sartines would fain have ensconced himself in his own dignity.    \"M. du Barry,\" was his reply, \"I shall render an account of my conduct  to the king.\"    \"Very well, sir,\" I replied, \"but do not suppose that either you or the  Choiseuls can give me any cause of fear.\"    M. de Sartines was thunderstruck; my boldness astonished him. At length  he said,    \"Madame, you are angry with me causelessly; I am more negligent than  culpable. It is useless to say this to the king.\"    \"I will not conceal from you, sir, that he knows it all, and is greatly  discontented with you.\"    \"I am lost then,\" said M. de Sartines.    \"Lost! not precisely,\" replied comte Jean; \"but you must decide at once  and for ever what party you will join. If you are with us they will use  you harshly; if you take the opposite party look to yourself. Choose.\"    After some turnings and twistings, accompanied with compliments, M. de  Sartines declared that he would range himself under our banner. Then  I extended to him my hand in token of reconciliation; he took it with  respect, and kissed it with gallantry. Up to this time we had conversed  with feelings of restraint and standing; but now we seated ourselves,  and begun a conference in form, as to the manner of preventing a  recurrence of the offensive outrages against me. As a proof of good  intention M. de Sartines told me the author of the two articles of which  I complained. He was a wretch, named Ledoux, who for twelve hundred  livres per annum wrote down all those who displeased the duchesse de  Grammont. This lady had no fear of doing all that was necessary to  remove every obstacle to the publication of such infamies.    After M. de Sartines had given us all the details which we desired,  and after I had promised to reconcile him to his master, he went away  delighted with having seen me. Believe me, my friend, it is necessary to  be as handsome as I am, that is to say, as I was, to seduce a lieutenant  of police.        CHAPTER VIII           The sieur Ledoux--The _lettre de cachet_--The duc de la       Vrilliere--Madame de Langeac--M. de Maupeou--Louis XV--The       comte Jean    On that very evening, the king having come to me, I said to him,    \"Sire, I have made acquaintance with M. de Sartines.\"    \"What! has he been to make friends with you?\"    \"Something like it: but he has appeared to me less culpable than I  thought. He had only yielded to the solicitation of my personal enemy.\"    \"You cannot have one at my court, madame; the lieutenant of police would  have done well not to have named her to you.\"    \"Thanks to him, however, I shall now know whom I ought to mistrust. I  know also who is the author of the two scurrilous paragraphs.\"    \"Some scamp, no doubt; some beggarly scoundrel.\"    \"A monsieur Ledoux.\"    \"Ah, I know the fellow. His bad reputation has reached me. It must be  stopped at last.\"    So saying, Louis XV went to the chimney, and pulled the bell-rope with  so much vehemence that ten persons answered it at once.    \"Send for the duc de la Vrilliere; if he be not suitably attired let him  come in his night-gown, no matter so that he appear quickly.\"    On hearing an order given in this manner a stranger might have supposed  the king crazy, and not intent on imprisoning a miserable libeller. I  interceded in his favor, but Louis XV, delighted at an opportunity  of playing the king at a small cost, told me that it was no person's  business, and he would be dictated to by no one. I was silent, reserving  myself until another opportunity when I could undertake the defence of  the poor devil.    The duc de la Vrilliere arrived, not in a dressing-gown, as the king  had authorized, but in magnificent costume. He piqued himself on his  expenditure, and always appeared superbly attired, altho' the splendor  of his apparel could not conceal the meanness of his look. He was the  oldest secretary of state, and certainly was the least skilful,"]]]
