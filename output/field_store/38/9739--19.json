The special principle we have just  illustrated was founded on the idea that the Sun journeys and shines for  every one, and that accordingly every one should contribute towards the  payment of his services. For the rest, the great herds of llamas, which  constituted a regular branch of the national wealth, could only be owned  by the temples of the Sun and by the Inca. Every province, every town  or village, had the exact nature and the exact quantity of the products  it must furnish assigned, and the Incas possessed great depots in which  were stored provisions, arms and clothes for the army. All this was  regulated, accounted for and checked by means of official Quipos.    The numerous body of officials charged with the general superintendence  and direction of affairs was organized in a very remarkable manner, well  calculated to consolidate the Inca's power. All the officials held their  authority from him, and represented him to the people, just as he  himself represented the Sun-god. At the bottom of the scale was an  official overseer for every ten families, next above an overseer of a  hundred families, then another placed over a thousand, and another over  ten thousand. Each province had a governor who generally belonged to the  family of the Incas. All this constituted a marvellous system of  surveillance and espionage, descending from the sovereign himself to the  meanest of his subjects, and founded on the principle that the rays of  the Sun pierce everywhere. The lowest members of this official  hierarchy, the superintendents of ten families, were responsible to  their immediate superiors for all that went on amongst those under their  charge, and those superiors again were responsible to the next above  them, and so on up to the Inca himself, who thus held the threads of the  whole vast net-work in the depths of his palace. It was another maxim of  the Peruvian state that every one must work, even old men and children.  Infants under five alone were excepted. It was the duty of the  superintendents of ten families to see that this was carried out  everywhere, and they were armed with disciplinary powers to chastise  severely any one who remained idle, or who ordered his house ill, or  gave rise to any scandal. Individual liberty then was closely  restrained. No one could leave his place of residence without leave. The  time for marriage was fixed for both sexes--for women at eighteen to  twenty, for men at twenty-four or upwards. The unions of the noble  families were arranged by the Inca himself, and those of the inferior  classes by his officers, who officially assigned the young people one  to another. Each province had its own costume, which might not be  changed for any other, and every one's birthplace was marked by a ribbon  of a certain colour surrounding his head.[43] In a word, the Jesuits  appear to have copied the constitution of the Peruvian society when they  organized their famous Paraguay missions, and perhaps this fact may help  us to trace the profound motives which in either case suggested so  minutely precise a system of inserting individuals into assigned places  which left no room for self-direction. The Incas and the Jesuits alike  had to contend against the disconnected, incoherent turbulence of savage  life, and both alike were thereby thrown upon an exaggerated system of  regulations, in which each individual was swaddled and meshed in  supervisions and ordinances from which it was impossible to escape.    Having said so much, we must acknowledge that, generally speaking, the  Incas made a very humane and paternal use of their absolute power. They  strove to moderate the desolating effects of war, and generally treated  the conquered peoples with kindness. But we note that in the century  preceding that of the European conquest, they had devised a means of  guarding against revolts exactly similar to the measures enforced  against rebellious peoples by the despotic sovereigns of Nineveh and  Babylon; that is to say, they transported a great part of the conquered  populations into other parts of their empire, and it appears that Cuzco,  like Babylon, presented an image in miniature of the whole empire.  There, as at Babylon, a host of different languages might be heard, and  it was amongst the children of the deported captives that Pizarro, like  Cyrus at Babylon, found allies who rejoiced in the fall of the empire  that had crushed their fathers. For the rest, the Incas endeavoured to  spread the language of Cuzco, the _Quechua_, throughout their  empire.[44] Nothing need surprise us in the way of political sagacity  and insight on the part of this priestly dynasty. Its monarchs seem to  have hit upon every device which has been imagined elsewhere for  attaching the conquered peoples to themselves or rendering their  hostility harmless. Thus you will remember that at Mexico there was a  chapel that served as a prison for the idols of the conquered. In the  same way there stood in the neighbourhood of Cuzco a great temple with  seventy-eight chapels in it, where the images of all the gods worshipped  in Peru were assembled. Each country had its altar there, on which  sacrifice was made according to the local customs.[45]    The Spaniards, amongst whom respect for the royal person was  sufficiently profound, were amazed by the marks of extreme deference of  which the Inca was the object. They could not understand at first that  actual religious worship was paid to him. He alone had the inherent  right to be carried on a litter, and he never went out in any other  way, imitating the Sun, his ancestor, who traverses the world without  ever putting his foot to the ground. Some few men and women of the  highest rank might rejoice in the same distinction, but only if they had  obtained the Inca's sanction. In the same way, it was only the members  of the Inca family and the nobles of most exalted rank who were allowed  to wear their hair long, for this was a distinctive sign of the  favourites of the Sun. None could enter the presence of the reigning  Inca save bare-footed, clad in the most simple garments and bearing a  burden on his shoulders, all in token of humility; nor must he raise his  eyes throughout the audience, for no man looks upon the face of the Sun.  It seems that the Incas possessed \"the art of royal majesty\" in a high  degree. They could retain the impassive air of indifference, whatever  might be going on before their eyes, like the Sun, who passes without  emotion over everything that takes place below. It was thus that  Atahualpa appeared to the Spaniards, who remarked the all but stony  fixity of the Peruvian monarch's features in the presence of all the new  sights--horses, riding, fire-arms--which filled his subjects with  surprise and terror.[46] And such was the superhuman character of the  Inca, that even the base office of a spittoon--excuse such a detail--was  supplied by the hand of one of his ladies.[47] The salute was given to  the Inca by kissing one's hand and then raising it towards the Sun. At  his death the whole country went into mourning for a year. The young  Incas were educated together, under conditions of great austerity, and  were never allowed to mingle with young people of the inferior  classes.[48]    The army of the Incas was the army of the Sun. The obligation to  military service was universal, since the Sun shines for all men. Every  sound man from twenty-five to fifty might be called on to serve in his  company. Thus numerous and highly-disciplined armies were raised, for  the spirit of obedience had penetrated all classes of the people. The  Incas had abolished the use of poisoned arrows, which is so common  amongst the natives of the New World.[49]    Justice was organized after fixed laws, and, as is usually the case in  theocracies, these laws were severe. For in theocracies, to the social  evil of the offence is added the impiety committed against the Deity and  his representative on earth. The culprit has been guilty not only of  crime, but of sacrilege. The penalty of death was freely inflicted even  in the case of offences that implied no evil disposition.[50] The  palanquin-bearer, for instance, who should stumble under his august  burden when carrying the Inca, or any one who should speak with the  smallest disrespect of him, must die. But we must also note certain  principles of sound justice which the Incas had likewise succeeded in  introducing. The judges were controlled, and, in case of unjust  judgments, punished. The law was more lenient to a first offence than to  a second, to crimes committed in the heat of the moment than to those of  malise prepense; more lenient to children than to adults, and (mark  this) more lenient to the common people than to the great.[51] The  members of the Inca family alone were exempted from the penalty of  death, which in their case was replaced by imprisonment for life. They  alone might, and indeed must, marry their sisters, for a reason that we  shall see further on. Thus everything was calculated to set this divine  family apart. Polygamy, too, was only allowed to the Incas and to the  families of next highest rank after them, who, however, might not marry  at all without the personal assent of the sovereign.[52] But the Incas  strove to make themselves loved. Herrera tells us of establishments in  which orphans and foundlings were brought up at the Inca's charges, and  of the alms he bestowed on widows who had no means of subsistence.[53]    The same deliberate system shows itself in the attempts to spread  education. The Incas founded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#16)"],[1,"later, when the observer has been carried by the earth's rotation to the  point _3_, every vestige of twilight will have vanished from his sky,  because all of the illuminated part of the atmosphere is now below his  horizon, which is represented by the line _3 L_. In the figure the sun  is represented to be 78° below this horizon line at the end of twilight,  but this is a gross exaggeration, made for the sake of clearness in the  drawing--in fact, twilight is usually said to end when the sun is 18°  below the horizon.    Let the student redraw Fig. 28 on a large scale, so that the points _1_  and _3_ shall be only 18° apart, as seen from the earth's center. He  will find that the point _L_ is brought down much closer to the surface  of the earth, and measuring the length of the line _2 L_, he should find  for the \"height of the atmosphere\" about one-eightieth part of the  radius of the earth--i. e., a little less than 50 miles. This, however,  is not the true height of the atmosphere. The air extends far beyond  this, but the particles of dust and vapor which are capable of sending  sunlight down to the earth seem all to lie below this limit.    The student should not fail to watch the eastern sky after sunset, and  see the shadow of the earth rise up and fill it while the twilight arch  retreats steadily toward the west.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--The cause of long and short twilights.]    _Duration of twilight._--Since twilight ends when the sun is 18° below  the horizon, any circumstance which makes the sun go down rapidly will  shorten the duration of twilight, and anything which retards the  downward motion of the sun will correspondingly prolong it. Chief among  influences of this kind is the angle which the sun's course makes with  the horizon. If it goes straight down, as at _a_, Fig. 29, a much  shorter time will suffice to carry it to a depression of 18° than is  needed in the case shown at _b_ in the same figure, where the motion is  very oblique to the horizon. If we consider different latitudes and  different seasons of the year, we shall find every possible variety of  circumstance from _a_ to _b_, and corresponding to these, the duration  of twilight varies from an all-night duration in the summers of Scotland  and more northern lands to an hour or less in the mountains of Peru. For  the sake of graphical effect, the shortness of tropical twilight is  somewhat exaggerated by Coleridge in the lines,        \"The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:       At one stride comes the dark.\"                              _The Ancient Mariner._    In the United States the longest twilights come at the end of June, and  last for a little more than two hours, while the shortest ones are in  March and September, amounting to a little more than an hour and a half;  but at all times the last half hour of twilight is hardly to be  distinguished from night, so small is the quantity of reflecting matter  in the upper regions of the atmosphere. For practical convenience it is  customary to assume in the courts of law that twilight ends an hour  after sunset.    How long does twilight last at the north pole?    _The Aurora._--One other phenomenon of the atmosphere may be mentioned,  only to point out that it is not of an astronomical character. The  Aurora, or northern lights, is as purely an affair of the earth as is a  thunderstorm, and its explanation belongs to the subject of terrestrial  magnetism.          CHAPTER VI    THE MEASUREMENT OF TIME      52. SOLAR TIME.--To measure any quantity we need a unit in terms of  which it must be expressed. Angles are measured in degrees, and the  degree is the unit for angular measurement. For most scientific purposes  the centimeter is adopted as the unit with which to measure distances,  and similarly a day is the fundamental unit for the measurement of time.  Hours, minutes, and seconds are aliquot parts of this unit convenient  for use in dealing with shorter periods than a day, and the week, month,  and year which we use in our calendars are multiples of the day.    Strictly speaking, a day is not the time required by the earth to make  one revolution upon its axis, but it is best defined as the amount of  time required for a particular part of the sky to make the complete  circuit from the meridian of a particular place through west and east  back to the meridian again. The day begins at the moment when this  specified part of the sky is on the meridian, and \"the time\" at any  moment is the hour angle of this particular part of the sky--i. e., the  number of hours, minutes, etc., that have elapsed since it was on the  meridian.    The student has already become familiar with the kind of day which is  based upon the motion of the vernal equinox, and which furnishes  sidereal time, and he has seen that sidereal time, while very convenient  in dealing with the motions of the stars, is decidedly inconvenient for  the ordinary affairs of life since in the reckoning of the hours it  takes no account of daylight and darkness. One can not tell off-hand  whether 10 hours, sidereal time, falls in the day or in the night. We  must in some way obtain a day and a system of time reckoning based upon  the apparent diurnal motion of the sun, and we may, if we choose, take  the sun itself as the point in the heavens whose transit over the  meridian shall mark the beginning and the end of the day. In this system  \"the time\" is the number of hours, minutes, etc., which have elapsed  since the sun was on the meridian, and this is the kind of time which is  shown by a sun dial, and which was in general use, years ago, before  clocks and watches became common. Since the sun moves among the stars  about a degree per day, it is easily seen that the rotating earth will  have to turn farther in order to carry any particular meridian from the  sun around to the sun again, than to carry it from a star around to the  same star, or from the vernal equinox around to the vernal equinox  again; just as the minute hand of a clock turns farther in going from  the hour hand round to the hour hand again than it turns in going from  XII to XII. These solar days and hours and minutes are therefore a  little longer than the corresponding sidereal ones, and this furnishes  the explanation why the stars come to the meridian a little earlier, by  solar time, every night than on the night before, and why sidereal time  gains steadily upon solar time, this gain amounting to approximately  3m. 56.5s. per day, or exactly one day per year, since the sun makes the  complete circuit of the constellations once in a year.    With the general introduction of clocks and watches into use about a  century ago this kind of solar time went out of common use, since no  well-regulated clock could keep the time correctly. The earth in its  orbital motion around the sun goes faster in some parts of its orbit  than in others, and in consequence the sun appears to move more rapidly  among the stars in winter than in summer; moreover, on account of the  convergence of hour circles as we go away from the equator, the same  amount of motion along the ecliptic produces more effect in winter and  summer when the sun is north or south, than it does in the spring and  autumn when the sun is near the equator, and as a combined result of  these causes and other minor ones true solar time, as it is called, is  itself not uniform, but falls behind the uniform lapse of sidereal time  at a variable rate, sometimes quicker, sometimes slower. A true solar  day, from noon to noon, is 51 seconds shorter in September than in  December.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--The equation of time.]    53. MEAN SOLAR TIME.--To remedy these inconveniences there has been  invented and brought into common use what is called _mean solar time_,  which is perfectly uniform in its lapse and which, by comparison with  sidereal time, loses exactly one day per year. \"The time\" in this system  never differs much from true solar time, and the difference between the  two for any particular day may be found in any good almanac, or may be  read from the curve in Fig. 30, in which the part of the curve above the  line marked _0m_ shows how many minutes mean solar time is faster than  true solar time. The correct name for this difference between the two  kinds of solar time is the _equation of time_, but in the almanacs it is  frequently marked \"sun fast\" or \"sun slow.\" In sidereal time and true  solar time the distinction between A. M. hours (_ante meridiem_ =  before the sun reaches the meridian) and P. M. hours (_post meridiem_ =  after the sun has passed the meridian) is not observed, \"the time\" being  counted from 0 hours to 24 hours, commencing when the sun or vernal  equinox is on the meridian. Occasionally the attempt is made to  introduce into common use this mode of reckoning the hours, beginning  the day (date) at midnight and counting the hours consecutively up to  24, when the next date is reached and a new start made. Such a system  would simplify railway time tables and similar publications; but the  American public is slow to adopt it, although the system has come into  practical use in Canada and Spain.    54. TO FIND (APPROXIMATELY) THE SIDEREAL TIME AT ANY MOMENT.--RULE I.  When the mean solar time is known. Let _W_ represent the time shown by  an ordinary watch, and represent by _S_ the corresponding sidereal time  and by _D_ the number of days that have elapsed from March 23d to the  date in question. Then        S = W + 69/70 × D × 4.    The last term is expressed in minutes, and should be reduced to hours  and minutes. Thus at 4 P. M. on July 4th--                    _D_ = 103 days.      69/70 × _D_ × 4 = 406m.                      = 6h. 46m.                  _W_ = 4h. 0m.                  _S_ = 10h. 46m.    The daily gain of sidereal upon mean solar time is 69/70 of 4 minutes,  and March 23d is the date on which sidereal and mean solar time are"]]]
