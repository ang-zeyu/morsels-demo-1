It's restful and homey, and the people are so  nice. If you like, I'll give you the address of the family I boarded  with.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Constance indifferently. \"I might as well go there  as anywhere else.\"    \"Yes, but listen to me, dear. Don't take your morbidness with you.  Open your heart to the summer, and let its sunshine in, and when you  come back in the fall, come prepared to let us all be your friends.  We'd like to be, and while friendship doesn't take the place of the  love of one's own people, still it is a good and beautiful thing.  Besides, there are other unhappy people in the world--try to help them  when you meet them, and you'll forget about yourself. Good-by for now,  and I hope you'll have a pleasant vacation in spite of yourself.\"    Constance went to Pine Valley, but she took her evil spirit with her.  Not even the beauty of the valley, with its great balmy pines, and the  cheerful friendliness of its people could exorcise it.    Nevertheless, she liked the place and found a wholesome pleasure in  the long tramps she took along the piney roads.    \"I saw such a pretty spot in my ramble this afternoon,\" she told her  landlady one evening. \"It is about three miles from here at the end of  the valley. Such a picturesque, low-eaved little house, all covered  over with honeysuckle. It was set between a big orchard and an  old-fashioned flower garden with great pines at the back.\"    \"Heartsease Farm,\" said Mrs. Hewitt promptly. \"Bless you, there's only  one place around here of that description. Mr. and Mrs. Bruce, Uncle  Charles and Aunt Flora, as we all call them, live there. They are the  dearest old couple alive. You ought to go and see them, they'd be  delighted. Aunt Flora just loves company. They're real lonesome by  times.\"    \"Haven't they any children?\" asked Constance indifferently. Her  interest was in the place, not in the people.    \"No. They had a niece once, though. They brought her up and they just  worshipped her. She ran away with a worthless fellow--I forget his  name, if I ever knew it. He was handsome and smooth-tongued, but he  was a scamp. She died soon after and it just broke their hearts. They  don't even know where she was buried, and they never heard anything  more about her husband. I've heard that Aunt Flora's hair turned  snow-white in a month. I'll take you up to see her some day when I  find time.\"    Mrs. Hewitt did not find time, but thereafter Constance ordered her  rambles that she might frequently pass Heartsease Farm. The quaint old  spot had a strange attraction for her. She found herself learning to  love it, and so unused was this unfortunate girl to loving anything  that she laughed at herself for her foolishness.    One evening a fortnight later Constance, with her arms full of ferns  and wood-lilies, came out of the pine woods above Heartsease Farm just  as heavy raindrops began to fall. She had prolonged her ramble  unseasonably, and it was now nearly night, and very certainly a rainy  night at that. She was three miles from home and without even an extra  wrap.    She hurried down the lane, but by the time she reached the main road,  the few drops had become a downpour. She must seek shelter somewhere,  and Heartsease Farm was the nearest. She pushed open the gate and ran  up the slope of the yard between the hedges of sweetbriar. She was  spared the trouble of knocking, for as she came to a breathless halt  on the big red sandstone doorstep, the door was flung open, and the  white-haired, happy-faced little woman standing on the threshold had  seized her hand and drawn her in bodily before she could speak a word.    \"I saw you coming from upstairs,\" said Aunt Flora gleefully, \"and I  just ran down as fast as I could. Dear, dear, you are a little wet.  But we'll soon dry you. Come right in--I've a bit of a fire in the  grate, for the evening is chilly. They laughed at me for loving a fire  so, but there's nothing like its snap and sparkle. You're rained in  for the night, and I'm as glad as I can be. I know who you are--you  are Miss Foster. I'm Aunt Flora, and this is Uncle Charles.\"    Constance let herself be put into a cushiony chair and fussed over  with an unaccustomed sense of pleasure. The rain was coming down in  torrents, and she certainly was domiciled at Heartsease Farm for the  night. Somehow, she felt glad of it. Mrs. Hewitt was right in calling  Aunt Flora sweet, and Uncle Charles was a big, jolly, ruddy-faced old  man with a hearty manner. He shook Constance's hand until it ached,  threw more pine knots in the fire and told her he wished it would rain  every night if it rained down a nice little girl like her.    She found herself strangely attracted to the old couple. The name of  their farm was in perfect keeping with their atmosphere. Constance's  frozen soul expanded in it. She chatted merrily and girlishly, feeling  as if she had known them all her life.    When bedtime came, Aunt Flora took her upstairs to a little gable  room.    \"My spare room is all in disorder just now, dearie, we have been  painting its floor. So I'm going to put you here in Jeannie's room.  Someway you remind me of her, and you are just about the age she was  when she left us. If it wasn't for that, I don't think I could put you  in her room, not even if every other floor in the house were being  painted. It is so sacred to me. I keep it just as she left it, not a  thing is changed. Good night dearie, and I hope you'll have pleasant  dreams.\"    When Constance found herself alone in the room, she looked about her  with curiosity. It was a very dainty, old-fashioned little room. The  floor was covered with braided mats; the two square, small-paned  windows were draped with snowy muslin. In one corner was a little  white bed with white curtains and daintily ruffled pillows, and in the  other a dressing table with a gilt-framed mirror and the various  knick-knacks of a girlish toilet. There was a little blue rocker and  an ottoman with a work-basket on it. In the work-basket was a bit of  unfinished, yellowed lace with a needle sticking in it. A small  bookcase under the sloping ceiling was filled with books.    Constance picked up one and opened it at the yellowing title-page. She  gave a little cry of surprise. The name written across the page in a  fine, dainty script was \"Jean Constance Irving,\" her mother's name!    For a moment Constance stood motionless. Then she turned impulsively  and hurried downstairs again. Mr. and Mrs. Bruce were still in the  sitting room talking to each other in the firelight.    \"Oh,\" cried Constance excitedly. \"I must know, I must ask you. This is  my mother's name, Jean Constance Irving, can it be possible she was  your little Jeannie?\"           *       *       *       *       *    A fortnight later Miss Channing received a letter from Constance.    \"I am so happy,\" she wrote. \"Oh, Miss Channing, I have found 'mine own  people,' and Heartsease Farm is to be my own, own dear home for  always.    \"It was such a strange coincidence, no, Aunt Flora says it was  Providence, and I believe it was, too. I came here one rainy night,  and Aunty put me in my mother's room, think of it! My own dear  mother's room, and I found her name in a book. And now the mystery is  all cleared up, and we are so happy.    \"Everything is dear and beautiful, and almost the dearest and most  beautiful thing is that I am getting acquainted with my mother, the  mother I never knew before. She no longer seems dead to me. I feel  that she lives and loves me, and I am learning to know her better  every day. I have her room and her books and all her little girlish  possessions. When I read her books, with their passages underlined by  her hand, I feel as if she were speaking to me. She was very good and  sweet, in spite of her one foolish, bitter mistake, and I want to be  as much like her as I can.    \"I said that this was _almost_ the dearest and most beautiful thing.  The very dearest and most beautiful is this--God means something to me  now. He means so much! I remember that you said to me that he meant  nothing to me because I had no human love in my heart to translate the  divine. But I have now, and it has led me to Him.    \"I am not going back to Taunton. I have sent in my resignation. I am  going to stay home with Aunty and Uncle. It is so sweet to say _home_  and know what it means.    \"Aunty says you must come and spend all your next vacation with us.  You see, I have lots of vacation plans now, even for a year ahead.  After all, there is no need of the blue pills!    \"I feel like a new creature, made over from the heart and soul out. I  look back with shame and contrition on the old Constance. I want you  to forget her and only remember your grateful friend, the _new_  Constance.\"          Ida's New Year Cake      Mary Craig and Sara Reid and Josie Pye had all flocked into Ida  Mitchell's room at their boarding-house to condole with each other  because none of them was able to go home for New Year's. Mary and  Josie had been home for Christmas, so they didn't really feel so badly  off. But Ida and Sara hadn't even that consolation.    Ida was a third-year student at the Clifton Academy; she had holidays,  and nowhere, so she mournfully affirmed, to spend them. At home three  brothers and a sister were down with the measles, and, as Ida had  never had them, she could not go there; and the news had come too late  for her to make any other arrangements.    Mary and Josie were clerks in a Clifton bookstore, and Sara was  stenographer in a Clifton lawyer's office. And they were all jolly  and thoughtless and very fond of one another.    \"This will be the first New Year's I have ever spent away from home,\"  sighed Sara, nibbling chocolate fudge. \"It does make me so blue to  think of it. And not even a holiday--I'll have to go to work just the  same. Now Ida"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#16)"],[1," solace. As often as he could he stole away to its wild and lonely  shore, leaving the snug bounds of cultivated home lands behind him  with something like a sense of relief. Down there by the lake was a  primitive wilderness where man was as naught and man-made doctrines  had no place. There one might walk hand in hand with nature and so  come very close to God. Many of Alan's best sermons were written after  he had come home, rapt-eyed, from some long shore tramp where the  wilderness had opened its heart to him and the pines had called to him  in their soft, sibilant speech.    With a half guilty glance at the futile sermon, he took his hat and  went out. The sun of the cool spring evening was swinging low over the  lake as he turned into the unfrequented, deep-rutted road leading to  the shore. It was two miles to the lake, but half way there Alan came  to where another road branched off and struck down through the pines  in a northeasterly direction. He had sometimes wondered where it led  but he had never explored it. Now he had a sudden whim to do so and  turned into it. It was even rougher and lonelier than the other;  between the ruts the grasses grew long and thickly; sometimes the pine  boughs met overhead; again, the trees broke away to reveal wonderful  glimpses of gleaming water, purple islets, dark feathery coasts.  Still, the road seemed to lead nowhere and Alan was half repenting the  impulse which had led him to choose it when he suddenly came out from  the shadow of the pines and found himself gazing on a sight which  amazed him.    Before him was a small peninsula running out into the lake and  terminating in a long sandy point. Beyond it was a glorious sweep of  sunset water. The peninsula itself seemed barren and sandy, covered  for the most part with scrub firs and spruces, through which the  narrow road wound on to what was the astonishing; feature in the  landscape--a grey and weather-beaten house built almost at the  extremity of the point and shadowed from the western light by a thick  plantation of tall pines behind it.    It was the house which puzzled Alan. He had never known there was any  house near the lake shore--had never heard mention made of any; yet  here was one, and one which was evidently occupied, for a slender  spiral of smoke was curling upward from it on the chilly spring air.  It could not be a fisherman's dwelling, for it was large and built  after a quaint tasteful design. The longer Alan looked at it the more  his wonder grew. The people living here were in the bounds of his  congregation. How then was it that he had never seen or heard of them?    He sauntered slowly down the road until he saw that it led directly to  the house and ended in the yard. Then he turned off in a narrow path  to the shore. He was not far from the house now and he scanned it  observantly as he went past. The barrens swept almost up to its door  in front but at the side, sheltered from the lake winds by the pines,  was a garden where there was a fine show of gay tulips and golden  daffodils. No living creature was visible and, in spite of the  blossoming geraniums and muslin curtains at the windows and the homely  spiral of smoke, the place had a lonely, almost untenanted, look.    When Alan reached the shore he found that it was of a much more open  and less rocky nature than the part which he had been used to  frequent. The beach was of sand and the scrub barrens dwindled down to  it almost insensibly. To right and left fir-fringed points ran out  into the lake, shaping a little cove with the house in its curve.    Alan walked slowly towards the left headland, intending to follow the  shore around to the other road. As he passed the point he stopped  short in astonishment. The second surprise and mystery of the evening  confronted him.    A little distance away a girl was standing--a girl who turned a  startled face at his unexpected appearance. Alan Douglas had thought  he knew all the girls in Rexton, but this lithe, glorious creature was  a stranger to him. She stood with her hand on the head of a huge,  tawny collie dog; another dog was sitting on his haunches beside her.    She was tall, with a great braid of shining chestnut hair, showing  ruddy burnished tints where the sunlight struck it, hanging over her  shoulder. The plain dark dress she wore emphasized the grace and  strength of her supple form. Her face was oval and pale, with straight  black brows and a finely cut crimson mouth--a face whose beauty bore  the indefinable stamp of race and breeding mingled with a wild  sweetness, as of a flower growing in some lonely and inaccessible  place. None of the Rexton girls looked like that. Who, in the name of  all that was amazing, could she be?    As the thought crossed Alan's mind the girl turned, with an air of  indifference that might have seemed slightly overdone to a calmer  observer than was the young minister at that moment and, with a  gesture of command to her dogs, walked quickly away into the scrub  spruces. She was so tall that her uncovered head was visible over them  as she followed some winding footpath, and Alan stood like a man  rooted to the ground until he saw her enter the grey house. Then he  went homeward in a maze, all thought of sermons, doctrinal or  otherwise, for the moment knocked out of his head.    She is the most beautiful woman I ever saw, he thought. How is it  possible that I have lived in Rexton for six months and never heard of  her or of that house? Well, I daresay there's some simple explanation  of it all. The place may have been unoccupied until lately--probably  it is the summer residence of people who have only recently come to  it. I'll ask Mrs. Danby. She'll know if anybody will. That good woman  knows everything about everybody in Rexton for three generations back.    Alan found Isabel King with his housekeeper when he got home. His  greeting was tinged with a slight constraint. He was not a vain man,  but he could not help knowing that Isabel looked upon him with a  favour that had in it much more than professional interest. Isabel  herself showed it with sufficient distinctness. Moreover, he felt a  certain personal dislike of her and of her hard, insistent beauty,  which seemed harder and more insistent than ever contrasted with his  recollection of the girl of the lake shore.    Isabel had a trick of coming to the manse on plausible errands to Mrs.  Danby and lingering until it was so dark that Alan was in courtesy  bound to see her home. The ruse was a little too patent and amused  Alan, although he carefully hid his amusement and treated Isabel with  the fine unvarying deference which his mother had engrained into him  for womanhood--a deference that flattered Isabel even while it annoyed  her with the sense of a barrier which she could not break down or  pass. She was the daughter of the richest man in Rexton and inclined  to give herself airs on that account, but Alan's gentle indifference  always brought home to her an unwelcome feeling of inferiority.    \"You've been tiring yourself out again tramping that lake shore, I  suppose,\" said Mrs. Danby, who had kept house for three bachelor  ministers and consequently felt entitled to hector them in a somewhat  maternal fashion.    \"Not tiring myself--resting and refreshing myself rather,\" smiled  Alan. \"I was tired when I went out but now I feel like a strong man  rejoicing to run a race. By the way, Mrs. Danby, who lives in that  quaint old house away down at the very shore? I never knew of its  existence before.\"    Alan's \"by the way\" was not quite so indifferent as he tried to make  it. Isabel King, leaning back posingly among the cushions of the  lounge, sat quickly up as he asked his question.    \"Dear me, you don't mean to say you've never heard of Captain  Anthony--Captain Anthony Oliver?\" said Mrs. Danby. \"He lives down  there at Four Winds, as they call it--he and his daughter and an old  cousin.\"    Isabel King bent forward, her brown eyes on Alan's face.    \"Did you see Lynde Oliver?\" she asked with suppressed eagerness.    Alan ignored the question--perhaps he did not hear it.    \"Have they lived there long?\" he asked.    \"For eighteen years,\" said Mrs. Danby placidly. \"It's funny you  haven't heard them mentioned. But people don't talk much about the  Captain now--he's an old story--and of course they never go anywhere,  not even to church. The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his  daughter is just as bad. To be sure, nobody knows much about her, but  it stands to reason that a girl who's had her bringing up must be odd,  to say no worse of her. It's not really her fault, I suppose--her  wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it. She's never  darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she's always  been a regular tomboy--running wild outdoors with dogs, and fishing  and shooting like a man. Nobody ever goes there--the Captain doesn't  want visitors. He must have done something dreadful in his time, if it  was only known, when he's so set on living like a hermit away down on  that jumping-off place. Did you see any of them?\"    \"I saw Miss Oliver, I suppose,\" said Alan briefly. \"At least I met a  young lady on the shore. But where did these people come from? Surely  more is known of them than this.\"    \"Precious little. The truth is, Mr. Douglas, folks don't think the  Olivers respectable and don't want to have anything to do with them.  Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where,  bought the Four Winds point, and built that house. He said he'd been a  sailor all his life and couldn't live away from the water. He brought  his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him. This Lynde  wasn't more than two years old then. People went to call but they  never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they weren't  wanted. Some of the men who'd been working round the place saw his  wife and said she was"]]]
