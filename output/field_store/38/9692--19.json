It was as if she enjoyed looking forward to something in which  nothing, neither an unsympathetic mother, nor the cruel fate which had  made her a colourless little nonentity, could prevent her from being the  chief performer.    \"I sometimes think,\" said Cecily, rather wearily, \"that it isn't so  dreadful to die young as I used to suppose.\"    She prefaced her remark with a slight cough, as she had been all too apt  to do of late, for the remnants of the cold she had caught the night we  were lost in the storm still clung to her.    \"Don't talk such nonsense, Cecily,\" cried the Story Girl with unwonted  sharpness, a sharpness we all understood. All of us, in our hearts,  though we never spoke of it to each other, thought Cecily was not as  well as she ought to be that spring, and we hated to hear anything said  which seemed in any way to touch or acknowledge the tiny, faint shadow  which now and again showed itself dimly athwart our sunshine.    \"Well, it was you began talking of being dead,\" said Felicity angrily.  \"I don't think it's right to talk of such things. Cecily, are you sure  your feet ain't damp? We ought to go in anyhow--it's too chilly out here  for you.\"    \"You girls had better go,\" said Dan, \"but I ain't going in till old  Isaac Frewen goes. I've no use for him.\"    \"I hate him, too,\" said Felicity, agreeing with Dan for once in her  life. \"He chews tobacco all the time and spits on the floor--the horrid  pig!\"    \"And yet his brother is an elder in the church,\" said Sara Ray  wonderingly.    \"I know a story about Isaac Frewen,\" said the Story Girl. \"When he was  young he went by the name of Oatmeal Frewen and he got it this way. He  was noted for doing outlandish things. He lived at Markdale then and he  was a great, overgrown, awkward fellow, six feet tall. He drove over to  Baywater one Saturday to visit his uncle there and came home the next  afternoon, and although it was Sunday he brought a big bag of oatmeal in  the wagon with him. When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service  was going on there, and he concluded to stop and go in. But he didn't  like to leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it,  because there were always mischievous boys around, so he hoisted the bag  on his back and walked into church with it and right to the top of the  aisle to Grandfather King's pew. Grandfather King used to say he  would never forget it to his dying day. The minister was preaching and  everything was quiet and solemn when he heard a snicker behind him.  Grandfather King turned around with a terrible frown--for you know in  those days it was thought a dreadful thing to laugh in church--to rebuke  the offender; and what did he see but that great, hulking young Isaac  stalking up the aisle, bending a little forward under the weight of a  big bag of oatmeal? Grandfather King was so amazed he couldn't laugh,  but almost everyone else in the church was laughing, and grandfather  said he never blamed them, for no funnier sight was ever seen. Young  Isaac turned into grandfather's pew and thumped the bag of oatmeal down  on the seat with a thud that cracked it. Then he plumped down beside  it, took off his hat, wiped his face, and settled back to listen to the  sermon, just as if it was all a matter of course. When the service was  over he hoisted his bag up again, marched out of church, and drove home.  He could never understand why it made so much talk; but he was known by  the name of Oatmeal Frewen for years.\"    Our laughter, as we separated, rang sweetly through the old orchard and  across the far, dim meadows. Felicity and Cecily went into the house  and Sara Ray and the Story Girl went home, but Peter decoyed me into the  granary to ask advice.    \"You know Felicity has a birthday next week,\" he said, \"and I want to  write her an ode.\"    \"A--a what?\" I gasped.    \"An ode,\" repeated Peter, gravely. \"It's poetry, you know. I'll put it  in Our Magazine.\"    \"But you can't write poetry, Peter,\" I protested.    \"I'm going to try,\" said Peter stoutly. \"That is, if you think she won't  be offended at me.\"    \"She ought to feel flattered,\" I replied.    \"You never can tell how she'll take things,\" said Peter gloomily. \"Of  course I ain't going to sign my name, and if she ain't pleased I won't  tell her I wrote it. Don't you let on.\"    I promised I wouldn't and Peter went off with a light heart. He said he  meant to write two lines every day till he got it done.    Cupid was playing his world-old tricks with others than poor Peter that  spring. Allusion has been made in these chronicles to one, Cyrus Brisk,  and to the fact that our brown-haired, soft-voiced Cecily had found  favour in the eyes of the said Cyrus. Cecily did not regard her conquest  with any pride. On the contrary, it annoyed her terribly to be teased  about Cyrus. She declared she hated both him and his name. She was as  uncivil to him as sweet Cecily could be to anyone, but the gallant Cyrus  was nothing daunted. He laid determined siege to Cecily's young heart by  all the methods known to love-lorn swains. He placed delicate tributes  of spruce gum, molasses taffy, \"conversation\" candies and decorated  slate pencils on her desk; he persistently \"chose\" her in all school  games calling for a partner; he entreated to be allowed to carry her  basket from school; he offered to work her sums for her; and rumour had  it that he had made a wild statement to the effect that he meant to  ask if he might see her home some night from prayer meeting. Cecily was  quite frightened that he would; she confided to me that she would rather  die than walk home with him, but that if he asked her she would be too  bashful to say no. So far, however, Cyrus had not molested her out of  school, nor had he as yet thumped Willy Fraser--who was reported to be  very low in his spirits over the whole affair.    And now Cyrus had written Cecily a letter--a love letter, mark you.  Moreover, he had sent it through the post-office, with a real stamp  on it. Its arrival made a sensation among us. Dan brought it from the  office and, recognizing the handwriting of Cyrus, gave Cecily no peace  until she showed us the letter. It was a very sentimental and rather  ill-spelled epistle in which the inflammable Cyrus reproached her in  heart-rending words for her coldness, and begged her to answer his  letter, saying that if she did he would keep the secret \"in violets.\"  Cyrus probably meant \"inviolate\" but Cecily thought it was intended for  a poetical touch. He signed himself \"your troo lover, Cyrus Brisk\" and  added in a postcript that he couldn't eat or sleep for thinking of her.    \"Are you going to answer it?\" asked Dan.    \"Certainly not,\" said Cecily with dignity.    \"Cyrus Brisk wants to be kicked,\" growled Felix, who never seemed to be  any particular friend of Willy Fraser's either. \"He'd better learn how  to spell before he takes to writing love letters.\"    \"Maybe Cyrus will starve to death if you don't,\" suggested Sara Ray.    \"I hope he will,\" said Cecily cruelly. She was truly vexed over the  letter; and yet, so contradictory a thing is the feminine heart, even at  twelve years old, I think she was a little flattered by it also. It was  her first love letter and she confided to me that it gives you a very  queer feeling to get it. At all events--the letter, though unanswered,  was not torn up. I feel sure Cecily preserved it. But she walked past  Cyrus next morning at school with a frozen countenance, evincing not the  slightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection. Cecily winced when  Pat caught a mouse, visited a school chum the day the pigs were killed  that she might not hear their squealing, and would not have stepped on a  caterpillar for anything; yet she did not care at all how much she made  the brisk Cyrus suffer.    Then, suddenly, all our spring gladness and Maytime hopes were blighted  as by a killing frost. Sorrow and anxiety pervaded our days and  embittered our dreams by night. Grim tragedy held sway in our lives for  the next fortnight.    Paddy disappeared. One night he lapped his new milk as usual at Uncle  Roger's dairy door and then sat blandly on the flat stone before it,  giving the world assurance of a cat, sleek sides glistening, plumy tail  gracefully folded around his paws, brilliant eyes watching the stir and  flicker of bare willow boughs in the twilight air above him. That was  the last seen of him. In the morning he was not.    At first we were not seriously alarmed. Paddy was no roving Thomas,  but occasionally he vanished for a day or so. But when two days passed  without his return we became anxious, the third day worried us greatly,  and the fourth found us distracted.    \"Something has happened to Pat,\" the Story Girl declared miserably. \"He  never stayed away from home more than two days in his life.\"    \"What could have happened to him?\" asked Felix.    \"He's been poisoned--or a dog has killed him,\" answered the Story Girl  in tragic tones.    Cecily began to cry at this; but tears were of no avail. Neither was  anything else, apparently. We searched every nook and cranny of barns  and out-buildings and woods on both the King farms; we inquired far and  wide; we roved over Carlisle meadows calling Paddy's name, until Aunt  Janet grew exasperated and declared we must stop making such exhibitions  of ourselves. But we found and heard no trace of our lost pet. The Story  Girl moped and refused to be comforted; Cecily declared she could not  sleep at night for thinking of poor Paddy dying miserably in some corner  to which he had dragged his failing body, or lying somewhere mangled and  torn by a dog. We hated every dog we saw on the ground that he might be  the guilty one.    \"It's the suspense that's so hard,\" sobbed the Story Girl. \"If I just  knew what had happened to him it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#16)"],[1,"sessions.\"    \"I've heard about the psi powers of the Hasturs,\" Forth said, \"but I've  never been lucky enough to meet one in person. Tell me about it. What  did he do?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jay made a tight movement of exasperation, too controlled for a shrug.  \"Ask him, why don't you. Look, Forth, I don't much care to see him. I  didn't do it for Darkover; I did it because it was my job. I'd prefer to  forget the whole thing. Why don't you talk to him?\"    \"I rather had the idea that he wanted to see you personally. Jay, you  did a tremendous thing, man! Damn it, why don't you strut a little?  Be--be normal for once! Why, I'd be damned near bursting with pride if  one of the Hasturs insisted on congratulating me personally!\"    Jay's lip twitched, and his voice shook with controlled exasperation.  \"Maybe you would. I don't see it that way.\"    \"Well, I'm afraid you'll have to. On Darkover nobody refuses when the  Hasturs make a request--and certainly not a request as reasonable as  this one.\" Forth sat down beside the desk. Jay struck the woodwork with  a violent clenched fist and when he lowered his hand there was a tiny  smear of blood along his knuckles. After a minute he walked to the couch  and sat down, very straight and stiff, saying nothing. Neither of the  men spoke again until Forth started at the sound of a buzzer, drew the  mouthpiece toward him, and said, \"Tell him we are honored--you know the  routine for dignitaries, and send him up here.\"    Jay twisted his fingers together and ran his thumb, in a new gesture,  over the ridge of scar tissue along the knuckles. Forth was aware of an  entirely new quality in the silence, and started to speak to break it,  but before he could do so, the office door slid open on its silent beam,  and Regis Hastur stood there.    Forth rose courteously and Jay got to his feet like a mechanical doll  jerked on strings. The young Darkovan ruler smiled engagingly at him:    \"Don't bother, this visit is informal; that's the reason I came here  rather than inviting you both to the Tower. Dr. Forth? It is a pleasure  to meet you again, sir. I hope that our gratitude to you will soon take  a more tangible form. There has not been a single death from the  trailmen's fever since you made the serum available.\"    Jay, motionless, saw bitterly that the old man had succumbed to the  youngster's deliberate charm. The chubby, wrinkled old face seamed up in  a pleased smile as Forth said, \"The gifts sent to the trailmen in your  name, Lord Hastur, were greatly welcomed.\"    \"Do you think that any of us will ever forget what they have done?\"  Regis replied. He turned toward the window and smiled rather tentatively  at the man who stood there; motionless since his first conventional  gesture of politeness:    \"Dr. Allison, do you remember me at all?\"    \"I remember you,\" Jay Allison said sullenly.    His voice hung heavy in the room, its sound a miasma in his ears. All  his sleepless, nightmare-charged brooding, all his bottled hate for  Darkover and the memories he had tried to bury, erupted into  overwrought bitterness against this too-ingratiating youngster who was  a demigod on this world and who had humiliated him, repudiated him for  the hated Jason ... for Jay, Regis had suddenly become the symbol of a  world that hated him, forced him into a false mold.    A black and rushing wind seemed to blur the room. He said hoarsely, \"I  remember you all right,\" and took one savage, hurtling step.    The weight of the unexpected blow spun Regis around, and the next moment  Jay Allison, who had never touched another human being except with the  remote hands of healing, closed steely, murderous hands around Regis'  throat. The world thinned out into a crimson rage. There were shouting  and sudden noises, and a red-hot explosion in his brain ...           *       *       *       *       *    \"You'd better drink this,\" Forth remarked, and I realized I was turning  a paper cup in my hands. Forth sat down, a little weakly, as I raised it  to my lips and sipped. Regis took his hand away from his throat and said  huskily, \"I could use some of that, Doctor.\"    I put the whiskey down. \"You'll do better with water until your throat  muscles are healed,\" I said swiftly, and went to fill a throwaway cup  for him, without thinking. Handing it to him. I stopped in sudden dismay  and my hand shook, spilling a few drops. I said hoarsely, swallowing,  \"--but drink it, anyway--\"    Regis got a few drops down, painfully, and said, \"My own fault. The  moment I saw--Jay Allison--I knew he was a madman. I'd have stopped him  sooner only he took me by surprise.\"    \"But--you say _him_--I'm Jay Allison,\" I said, and then my knees went  weak and I sat down. \"What in hell is this? I'm not Jay--but I'm not  Jason, either--\"    I could remember my entire life, but the focus had shifted. I still felt  the old love, the old nostalgia for the trailmen; but I also knew, with  a sure sense of identity, that I was Doctor Jason Allison, Jr., who had  abandoned mountain climbing and become a specialist in Darkovan  parasitology. Not Jay who had rejected his world; not Jason who had been  rejected by it. But then who?    Regis said quietly, \"I've seen you before--once. When you knelt to the  Old One of the trailmen.\" With a whimsical smile he said, \"As an  ignorant superstitious Darkovan, I'd say that you were a man who'd  balanced his god and daemon for once.\"    I looked helplessly at the young Hastur. A few seconds ago my hands had  been at his throat. Jay or Jason, maddened by self-hate and jealousy,  could disclaim responsibility for the other's acts.    I couldn't.    Regis said, \"We could take the easy way out, and arrange it so we'd  never have to see each other again. Or we could do it the hard way.\" He  extended his hand, and after a minute, I understood, and we shook hands  briefly, like strangers who have just met. He added, \"Your work with the  trailmen is finished, but We Hasturs committed ourselves to teach some  of the Terrans our science--matrix mechanics. Dr. Allison--Jason--you  know Darkover, and I think we could work with you. Further, you know  something about slipping mental gears. I meant to ask; would you care to  be one of them? You'd be ideal.\"    I looked out the window at the distant mountains. This work--this would  be something which would satisfy both halves of myself. The irresistible  force, the immovable object--and no ghosts wandering in my brain. \"I'll  do it,\" I told Regis. And then, deliberately, I turned my back on him  and went up to the quarters, now deserted, which we had readied for the  trailmen. With my new doubled--or complete--memories, another ghost had  roused up in my brain, and I remembered a woman who had appeared vaguely  in Jay Allison's orbit, unnoticed, working with the trailmen, tolerated  because she could speak their language. I opened the door, searched  briefly through the rooms, and shouted, \"Kyla!\" and she came. Running.  Disheveled. Mine.    At the last moment, she drew back a little from my arms and whispered,  \"You're Jason--but you're something more. Different ...\"    \"I don't know who I am,\" I said quietly, \"but I'm me. Maybe for the  first time. Want to help me find out just who that is?\"    I put my arm around her, trying to find a path between memory and  tomorrow. All my life, I had walked a strange road toward an unknown  horizon. Now, reaching my horizon, I found it marked only the rim of an  unknown country.    Kyla and I would explore it together."]]]
