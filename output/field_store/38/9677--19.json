Why should not the muscles be compressed? 193. What is the effect  of tight clothing upon the muscles? 194. What is said of the influence  of the mind upon muscular activity?

This principle was well illustrated in the retreat from Russia of  the defeated and dispirited French army. When no enemy was near,  they had hardly strength sufficient to carry their arms; but no  sooner did they hear the report of the Russian guns, than new life  seemed to pervade them, and they wielded their weapons powerfully  until the foe was repulsed, then there was a relapse to weakness, and  prostration followed. It is thus with the invalid when riding for  his health;--relate an anecdote, or excite this mental stimulus by  agreeable conversation, and much benefit will accrue from the ride  to the debilitated person. So it is in the daily vocations of  life; if the mind have some incentive, the tiresomeness of labor  will be greatly diminished. Let an air of cheerfulness ever pervade  our every employment, and, like music, \"it sweetens toil.\"    196. Facts illustrative of the inutility of calling the muscles into  action, without the cooperation of the mind, are seen in the  spiritless aspect of many of our boarding school processions, when a  walk is taken merely for exercise, without having in view any  attainable object. But present to the mind a botanical or geological  excursion, and the saunter will be exchanged for the elastic step, the  inanimate appearance for the bright eye and glowing cheek. The  difference is, simply, that, in the former case, the muscles are  obliged to work without that full nervous impulse so essential to  their energetic action; and that, in the latter, the nervous influence  is in full and harmonious operation.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    195. Give an illustration of mental stimulus cooperating with muscular  activity in the case of the dispirited French army in their retreat  from Russia. How can a union of mental impulse and muscular action be  beneficial to an invalid? Does this same principle apply to those who  labor? 196. Give an instance of the different effects produced by the  absence and presence of the mental stimulus.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    197. It must not, however, be supposed that a walk simply for the sake  of exercise can never be beneficial. Every one, unless prevented by  disease, should consider it a duty to take exercise every day in the  open air; if possible, let it be had in combination with harmonious  mental exhilaration; if not, let a walk, in an erect position, be made  so brisk as to produce rapid respiration and circulation of the blood,  and in a dress that shall not interfere with free motions of the arms  and free expansion of the chest.    _Observation._ The advantages of combining harmonious mental  excitement, with muscular activity, is thus given by Dr. Armstrong:--                                   \"_In whate'er you sweat,           Indulge your taste._ Some love the manly toils           The tennis some, and some the graceful dance;           Others, more hardy, range the purple heath           Or naked stubble, where, from field to field,           The sounding covies urge their lab'ring flight,           Eager amid the rising cloud to pour           The gun's unerring thunder; and there are           Whom still the mead of the green archer charm.           _He chooses best whose labor entertains           His vacant fancy most; the toil you hate           Fatigues you soon, and scarce improves your limbs._\"      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    197. May not a walk, simply as an exercise, be beneficial? What is  preferred?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER XI.    HYGIENE OF THE MUSCLES, CONTINUED.      198. _The erect attitude lessens the exhaustion of the muscles._ A  person whose position is erect will stand longer, walk further, and  perform more labor, than an individual whose position is stooping, but  equal in all other respects. The manly port in an erect attitude,  depends chiefly upon the action of the muscles of the back; and it  follows that the fewer the muscles in a state of tension, the less the  draught upon the nervous system, and the less its exhaustion. Another  advantage which attends the erect position is, the trunk and head are  balanced upon the bones and cartilages of the spinal column. If the  body slightly incline forward, the muscles attached to the posterior  side of the spine, by a gentle contraction, will bring it to the  perpendicular, and even incline it backward. This is immediately  removed by a slight contraction of the muscles upon the anterior side  of the spinal column.    199. In the erect position, there is a constant slight oscillation  of the body backward and forward, like the movement of a pendulum;  while, in the stooping posture, the muscles on the posterior side  of the spinal column are kept in a state of continued tension and  contraction, to prevent the body from falling forward. This enfeebles  the muscles of the back, and exhausts the nervous energy, while the  erect position favors their development and power, because there is  an alternate contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Again, in the  stooping position, the lower limbs are curved at the knee. In this  attitude, there is a constant tension of the muscles of the lower  extremities, which produces muscular exhaustion.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    198. Why will a person who stands erect walk further, and perform more  labor, than if he assumed the stooping posture? 199. Why are the  muscles of the back so soon exhausted in the stooping position?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 48. 1, A perpendicular line from the centre of the  feet to the upper extremity of the spinal column, where the head rests.  2, 2, 2, The spinal column, with its three natural curves. Here the head  and body are balanced upon the spinal column and joints of the lower  extremities, so that the muscles are not kept in a state of tension. This  erect position of the body and head is always accompanied with straight  lower limbs.]    [Illustration: Fig. 49. 1, A perpendicular line from the centre of the  feet. 2, Represents the unnatural curved spinal column, and its relative  position to the perpendicular, 1. The lower limbs are curved at the knee,  and the body is stooping forward. While standing in this position, the  muscles of the lower limbs and back are in continued tension, which  exhausts and weakens them.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What is represented by figs. 48 and 49?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    200. When it is necessary to call into action a part of the muscles of  the system in the performance of any duty, as those of the lower limbs  in walking, if the muscles of other parts are in a state of inaction,  the influence of the nervous system can be determined in an undivided  manner upon those parts of the lower limbs in action; hence they will  not so soon become wearied or exhausted, as when this influence is  divided between a greater number of muscles. In performing any labor,  as in speaking, reading, singing, mowing, sewing, &c., there will be  less exhaustion, and the effort can be longer maintained in the erect  position of the body and head, than in a stooping attitude.    _Experiment._ Hold in each hand a pail of water or equal weights, in a  stooping posture, as long as it can be done without much suffering and  injury. Again, when the muscular pain has ceased, hold the same pails  of water, for the same length of time, in an erect posture, and note  the difference in the fatigue of the muscles.    201. If the stooping posture is acquired in youth, we are quite  certain of seeing the deformed shoulders in old age. Hence the  importance of duly exercising the muscles of the back, for when they  are properly developed, the child can and will stand erect. In this  attitude, the shoulders will be thrown back, and the chest will become  broad and full.    202. Pupils, while standing during recitations, often inadvertently  assume the attitude represented by fig. 49, and it is the duty of  teachers to correct this position when assumed. When a child or adult  has contracted a habit of stooping, and has become round-shouldered,  it can be measurably, and generally, wholly, remedied by moderate and  repeated efforts to bring the shoulders back, and the spinal column in  an erect position. This deformity can and should be remedied in our  schools. It may take months to accomplish the desired end, yet it can  be done as well under the direction of the kind instructor, as under  the stern, military drill sergeant, who never fails to correct this  deformity among his raw recruits.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    200. What suggestion when it is necessary to call into action a part  of the muscular system? Give the experiment that illustrates this  principle. 201. Why should a child he taught to stand erect? 202. How  can round shoulders acquired by habit be remedied?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 50. A proper position in sitting.]    203. _The child should be taught to sit erect when employed in study  or work._ This attitude favors a healthy action of the various organs  of the system, and conduces to beauty and symmetry of form.

Sithence he went his way into the pillared hall, when it was now night,  and without the moon was up, and the trees of the wood as still as  images.  But within the hall shone bright with many candles, and the  fountain glittered in the light of them, as it ran tinkling sweetly into  the little stream; and the silvern bridges gleamed, and the pillars shone  all round about.    And there on the dais was a table dight most royally, and the Lady  sitting thereat, clad in her most glorious array, and behind her the Maid  standing humbly, yet clad in precious web of shimmering gold, but with  feet unshod, and the iron ring upon her ankle.    So Walter came his ways to the high-seat, and the Lady rose and greeted  him, and took him by the hands, and kissed him on either cheek, and sat  him down beside her.  So they fell to their meat, and the Maid served  them; but the Lady took no more heed of her than if she were one of the  pillars of the hall; but Walter she caressed oft with sweet words, and  the touch of her hand, making him drink out of her cup and eat out of her  dish.  As to him, he was bashful by seeming, but verily fearful; he took  the Lady's caresses with what grace he might, and durst not so much as  glance at her Maid.  Long indeed seemed that banquet to him, and longer  yet endured the weariness of his abiding there, kind to his foe and  unkind to his friend; for after the banquet they still sat a while, and  the Lady talked much to Walter about many things of the ways of the  world, and he answered what he might, distraught as he was with the  thought of those two trysts which he had to deal with.    At last spake the Lady and said: \"Now must I leave thee for a little, and  thou wottest where and how we shall meet next; and meanwhile disport thee  as thou wilt, so that thou weary not thyself, for I love to see thee  joyous.\"    Then she arose stately and grand; but she kissed Walter on the mouth ere  she turned to go out of the hall.  The Maid followed her; but or ever she  was quite gone, she stooped and made that sign, and looked over her  shoulder at Walter, as if in entreaty to him, and there was fear and  anguish in her face; but he nodded his head to her in yea-say of the  tryst in the hazel-copse, and in a trice she was gone.    Walter went down the hall, and forth into the early night; but in the  jaws of the porch he came up against the King's Son, who, gazing at his  attire glittering with all its gems in the moonlight, laughed out, and  said: \"Now may it be seen how thou art risen in degree above me, whereas  I am but a king's son, and that a king of a far country; whereas thou art  a king of kings, or shalt be this night, yea, and of this very country  wherein we both are.\"    Now Walter saw the mock which lay under his words; but he kept back his  wrath, and answered: \"Fair sir, art thou as well contented with thy lot  as when the sun went down?  Hast thou no doubt or fear?  Will the Maid  verily keep tryst with thee, or hath she given thee yea-say but to escape  thee this time?  Or, again, may she not turn to the Lady and appeal to  her against thee?\"    Now when he had spoken these words, he repented thereof, and feared for  himself and the Maid, lest he had stirred some misgiving in that young  man's foolish heart.  But the King's Son did but laugh, and answered  nought but to Walter's last words, and said: \"Yea, yea! this word of  thine showeth how little thou wottest of that which lieth betwixt my  darling and thine.  Doth the lamb appeal from the shepherd to the wolf?  Even so shall the Maid appeal from me to thy Lady.  What! ask thy Lady at  thy leisure what her wont hath been with her thrall; she shall think it a  fair tale to tell thee thereof.  But thereof is my Maid all whole now by  reason of her wisdom in leechcraft, or somewhat more.  And now I tell  thee again, that the beforesaid Maid must needs do my will; for if I be  the deep sea, and I deem not so ill of myself, that other one is the  devil; as belike thou shalt find out for thyself later on.  Yea, all is  well with me, and more than well.\"    And therewith he swung merrily into the litten hall.  But Walter went out  into the moonlit night, and wandered about for an hour or more, and stole  warily into the hall and thence into his own chamber.  There he did off  that royal array, and did his own raiment upon him; he girt him with  sword and knife, took his bow and quiver, and stole down and out again,  even as he had come in.  Then he fetched a compass, and came down into  the hazel-coppice from the north, and lay hidden there while the night  wore, till he deemed it would lack but little of midnight.          CHAPTER XXI: WALTER AND THE MAID FLEE FROM THE GOLDEN HOUSE      There he abode amidst the hazels, hearkening every littlest sound; and  the sounds were nought but the night voices of the wood, till suddenly  there burst forth from the house a great wailing cry.  Walter's heart  came up into his mouth, but he had no time to do aught, for following  hard on the cry came the sound of light feet close to him, the boughs  were thrust aside, and there was come the Maid, and she but in her white  coat, and barefoot.  And then first he felt the sweetness of her flesh on  his, for she caught him by the hand and said breathlessly: \"Now, now!  there may yet be time, or even too much, it may be.  For the saving of  breath ask me no questions, but come!\"    He dallied not, but went as she led, and they were lightfoot, both of  them.    They went the same way, due south to wit, whereby he had gone a-hunting  with the Lady; and whiles they ran and whiles they walked; but so fast  they went, that by grey of the dawn they were come as far as that coppice  or thicket of the Lion; and still they hastened onward, and but little  had the Maid spoken, save here and there a word to hearten up Walter, and  here and there a shy word of endearment.  At last the dawn grew into  early day, and as they came over the brow of a bent, they looked down  over a plain land whereas the trees grew scatter-meal, and beyond the  plain rose up the land into long green hills, and over those again were  blue mountains great and far away.    Then spake the Maid: \"Over yonder lie the outlying mountains of the  Bears, and through them we needs must pass, to our great peril.  Nay,  friend,\" she said, as he handled his sword-hilt, \"it must be patience and  wisdom to bring us through, and not the fallow blade of one man, though  he be a good one.  But look! below there runs a stream through the first  of the plain, and I see nought for it but we must now rest our bodies.  Moreover I have a tale to tell thee which is burning my heart; for maybe  there will be a pardon to ask of thee moreover; wherefore I fear thee.\"    Quoth Walter: \"How may that be?\"    She answered him not, but took his hand and led him down the bent.  But  he said: \"Thou sayest, rest; but are we now out of all peril of the  chase?\"    She said: \"I cannot tell till I know what hath befallen her.  If she be  not to hand to set on her trackers, they will scarce happen on us now; if  it be not for that one.\"    And she shuddered, and he felt her hand change as he held it.    Then she said: \"But peril or no peril, needs must we rest; for I tell  thee again, what I have to say to thee burneth my bosom for fear of thee,  so that I can go no further until I have told thee.\"    Then he said: \"I wot not of this Queen and her mightiness and her  servants.  I will ask thereof later.  But besides the others, is there  not the King's Son, he who loves thee so unworthily?\"    She paled somewhat, and said: \"As for him, there had been nought for thee  to fear in him, save his treason: but now shall he neither love nor hate  any more; he died last midnight.\"    \"Yea, and how?\" said Walter.    \"Nay,\" she said, \"let me tell my tale all together once for all, lest  thou blame me overmuch.  But first we will wash us and comfort us as best  we may, and then amidst our resting shall the word be said.\"    By then were they come down to the stream-side, which ran fair in pools  and stickles amidst rocks and sandy banks.  She said: \"There behind the  great grey rock is my bath, friend; and here is thine; and lo! the  uprising of the sun!\"    So she went her ways to the said rock, and he bathed him, and washed the  night off him, and by then he was clad again she came back fresh and  sweet from the water, and with her lap full of cherries from a wilding  which overhung her bath.  So they sat down together on the green grass  above the sand, and ate the breakfast of the wilderness: and Walter was  full of content as he watched her, and beheld her sweetness and her  loveliness; yet were they, either of them, somewhat shy and shamefaced  each with the other; so that he did but kiss her hands once and again,  and though she shrank not from him, yet had she no boldness to cast  herself into his arms.          CHAPTER XXII: OF THE DWARF AND THE PARDON      Now she began to say: \"My friend, now shall I tell thee what I have done  for thee and me; and if thou have a mind to blame me, and punish me, yet  remember first, that what I have done has been for thee and our hope of  happy life.  Well, I shall tell thee--\"    But therewithal her speech failed her; and, springing up, she faced the  bent and pointed with her finger, and she all deadly pale, and shaking so  that she might scarce stand, and might speak no word, though a feeble  gibbering came from her mouth.    Walter leapt up and put his arm about her, and looked whitherward she  pointed, and at first saw nought; and then nought but a brown and yellow  rock rolling down the bent: and then at last he saw that it was the Evil  Thing which had met him when first he came into that land; and now"]]]
