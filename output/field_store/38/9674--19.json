If taken in large quantities death is likely to  result so speedily that nothing can be done to relieve the patient, and  even if time is allowed and the action of the acid can be arrested it can  not be done until considerable and, perhaps, irreparable damage has been  done. The mucous membrane with which the acid has come in contact in the  esophagus may be destroyed by its corrosive action and carried away,  leaving the muscular tissues exposed. The raw surface heals irregularly,  the cicatrice contracting causes stricture, and an animal so injured is  likely to die of starvation. In the stomach even greater damage is likely  to be done. The peristaltic action of the esophagus carries the irritant  along quickly, but here it remains quiet in contact with one surface,  destroying it. It is likely to perforate the organ and, coming in contact  with the abdominal lining or other organs of digestion, soon sets up a  condition that is beyond repair. In a less concentrated form, when this is  not sufficiently strong to be corrosive, it exerts an irritant effect. In  this form it may not do much harm unless taken in considerable quantity.  When thus the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines becomes  inflamed pain and diarrhea are likely to result.    _Treatment._--Any of the alkalies may be used as an antidote. Most  convenient of these are chalk, baking soda, marble dust, magnesia, lime,  soap, or plaster from a wall. Mucilaginous drinks should be given in large  quantities.    VEGETABLE ACIDS.--Oxalic acid in particular is corrosive in its action when  taken in concentrated solution, losing its corrosive effect and becoming  irritant when more dilute. It also exerts a specific effect on the heart,  frequently causing death from syncope. Taken in the form either of the  crystals or solution it is likely to cause death in a very short time.  Failure of heart action and the attendant small pulse, weakness,  staggering, and convulsions are the more noticeable symptoms. Acetic acid  is irritant to the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause sudden paralysis  of the heart.    _Treatment._--The action of the acid should be counteracted by the use of  alkalies, as advised above, by limewater or lime or plaster given promptly,  by protectives to the digestive tract, and by stimulants.      POISONING BY ALKALIES.    The carbonates of potash and soda and the alkalies themselves in  concentrated form cause symptoms of intestinal irritation similar to those  produced by mineral acids. Ammonia, caustic soda, and caustic potash (lye)  are those to which animals are most exposed. The degree of their caustic  irritant effects depends on their degree of concentration. When they reach  the stomach the symptoms are nearly as well marked as in the case of the  acids. The irritation is even more noticeable, and purgation is likely to  be a more prominent symptom. If death is not caused soon, the irritation of  the gastrointestinal tract and malnutrition will last for a long time.    _Treatment._--Treatment consists in neutralizing the alkali by an acid,  such as dilute sulphuric acid (1 per cent) or strong vinegar. The  administration of such an antidote and its action must be carefully watched  during administration. In the chemical change which takes place when the  acid and alkali are combined, carbonic-acid gas is liberated, which may be  to an extent sufficient to cause considerable distention of the abdomen,  and even to produce asphyxia from pressure forward on the diaphragm. Should  this danger present itself, it may be averted by opening the flank,  permitting the gas to escape. (See \"Acute tympanites, or Bloating,\" p. 22.)  Flaxseed or slippery-elm decoction must be given to sooth the inflamed  mucous surface. Opium may be used to allay pain.      COAL-OIL POISONING.    Coal oil is sometimes administered empirically as a treatment for  intestinal parasites. If given in large doses it produces poisonous  effects, which are likely to be manifested some time after the  administration. It acts as an irritant to the digestive tract, causing  dribbling of ropy saliva from the mouth, diarrhea, tenesmus, and loss of  appetite, with increased temperature and cold extremities. Visible mucous  membranes are injected, pupils of the eyes are contracted, and there is a  watery discharge from the eyes and nostrils. Remotely it exerts a  depressing influence on the functions of the brain and slight coma, and  occasionally convulsions, from which the animal is easily aroused. The  kidneys also suffer. The urine is dark colored and has the characteristic  odor of coal oil. Death may result from gastroenteritis or convulsions.    _Treatment._--The patient's strength should be fostered by the frequent  administration of mild stimulants, of which aromatic spirits of ammonia is  perhaps the best. The animal should be encouraged to eat soft feed and  given mucilaginous drinks.    Crude coal oil is sometimes applied to the skin to kill parasites. If too  much is used, especially in hot weather, great weakness and depression may  be caused and in some cases death may result.      CARBOLIC-ACID POISONING.    Although one of the most valuable antiseptic remedies, carbolic acid in a  concentrated form, when taken internally or used over a large surface  externally, is likely to produce poisonous effects. It causes whitening,  shrinking, and numbness of the structures with which it comes in contact,  and, besides its irritant effect, exerts a powerful influence on the  nervous system. Being readily absorbed, it produces its effect whether  swallowed, injected into the rectum, inhaled, or applied to wounds, or even  to a large tract of unbroken skin. Used extensively as a dressing, it may  produce nausea, dizziness, and smoky or blackish colored urine. The last  symptom is nearly always noticeable where the poisonous effect is produced.  In more concentrated form, or used in larger quantities, convulsions,  followed by fatal coma, are likely to take place. Even in smaller  quantities, dullness, trembling, and disinclination for food often continue  for several days. In a tolerably concentrated solution it coagulates  albumen and acts as an astringent.    _Treatment._--As an antidote internally, a solution of sulphate of soda or  sulphate of magnesia (Glauber's or Epsom salt) may be given. The white of  egg is also useful. Stimulants may be given if needed. When the poisoning  occurs through too extensive applications to wounds or the skin, as in  treatment of mange, cold water should be freely applied so as to wash off  any of the acid that may still remain unabsorbed. As a surgical dressing a  3 per cent solution is strong enough for ordinary purposes. Water will not  hold more than 5 per cent in permanent solution. No preparation stronger  than the saturated solution should be used medicinally under any  circumstances.      SALTPETER POISONING.    Both nitrate of soda and nitrate of potassium are poisonous to cattle.  These substances are used for manure and for preserving meats. They may be  administered in a drench by error in place of Glauber's salt, or they may  be exposed within reach of cattle and thus be eaten. The toxic dose depends  upon the condition of fullness of the stomach. If in solution and given on  an empty stomach, as little as 3 ounces of saltpeter (nitrate of potassium)  may be fatal to a cow. More of the Chile saltpeter (nitrate of soda) is  required to cause serious trouble.    _Symptoms._--Severe gastroenteritis, colic, tympanites, diarrhea, excessive  urination, weakness, trembling, convulsions, collapse.    _Treatment._--Same as for poisoning by common salt.      POISONING BY COMMON SALT.    A few pounds (3 to 5) of common salt will produce well-marked signs of  poisoning in cattle. So much salt as this will not be taken by cattle  except under unusual conditions. If the feed is poor in salt, and if no  salt has been given for a long time, an intense \"salt hunger\" may occur  that may lead an animal to eat a poisonous quantity, or an overdose of salt  may be given by error as a drench. In order to prevent overeating of salt,  it is doubtless better in salting cattle to use rock salt rather than that  in more or less finely divided form.    Herring and mackerel brine and pork pickle are also poisonous, and are  especially dangerous for hogs. In these substances there are, in addition  to salt, certain products extracted from the fish or meat which undergo  change and add to the toxicity of the solution. Sometimes saltpeter is  present in such brines.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are great thirst, abdominal pain, diarrhea, poor  appetite, redness and dryness of the mouth, increased urination, paralysis  of the hind legs, weak pulse, general paralysis, coma, and death in from  six to eight hours.    _Treatment._--Allow as much warm water as the animal will drink; give  protectives, such as linseed tea, etc. Linseed or olive oil may be given.  To keep up the heart action give ether, alcohol, camphor, digitalis, or  coffee. To allay pain, give opium.      VEGETABLE POISONS.    Vegetable poisons may be divided into two classes--those that are likely to  be administered to the animal as medicine, and such as may be taken in the  feed, either in the shape of poisonous plants or as plants or feeds of  vegetable origin that have been damaged by fungi or by bacteria which have  produced fermentation or putrefaction.      VEGETABLE POISONS USED AS MEDICINE.    OPIUM (MORPHIN, LAUDANUM) POISONING.    Opium and its alkaloid, morphia, are so commonly used in the practice of  medicine that the poisonous result of an overdose is not uncommon. The  common preparations are gum opium, the inspissated juice of the poppy;  powdered opium, made from the gum; tincture of opium, commonly called  laudanum; and the alkaloid or active principle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#16)"],[1,"Convention adjourned\" over the Fourth. The committee  was chosen by ballot, and its composition was a clear indication that  the small-State men had won their fight, and that a compromise would be  effected.    It was during the debate upon this subject, when feeling was running  high and when at times it seemed as if the Convention in default of any  satisfactory solution would permanently adjourn, that Franklin proposed  that \"prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven... be held in this  Assembly every morning.\" Tradition relates that Hamilton opposed the  motion. The members were evidently afraid of the impression which would  be created outside, if it were suspected that there were dissensions in  the Convention, and the motion was not put to a vote.    How far physical conditions may influence men in adopting any particular  course of action it is impossible to say. But just when the discussion  in the Convention reached a critical stage, just when the compromise  presented by the committee was ready for adoption or rejection, the  weather turned from unpleasantly hot to being comfortably cool. And,  after some little time spent in the consideration Of details, on the  16th of July, the great compromise of the Constitution was adopted.  There was no other that compared with it in importance. Its most  significant features were that in the upper house each State should  have an equal vote and that in the lower house representation should  be apportioned on the basis of population, while direct taxation should  follow the same proportion. The further proviso that money bills should  originate in the lower house and should not be amended in the upper  house was regarded by some delegates as of considerable importance,  though others did not think so, and eventually the restriction upon  amendment by the upper house was dropped.    There has long been a prevailing belief that an essential feature of the  great compromise was the counting of only three-fifths of the slaves in  enumerating the population. This impression is quite erroneous. It was  one of the details of the compromise, but it had been a feature of the  revenue amendment of 1783, and it was generally accepted as a happy  solution of the difficulty that slaves possessed the attributes both  of persons and of property. It had been included both in the amended  Virginia Plan and in the New Jersey Plan; and when it was embodied in  the compromise it was described as \"the ratio recommended by Congress in  their resolutions of April 18, 1783.\" A few months later, in explaining  the matter to the Massachusetts convention, Rufus King said that, \"This  rule... was adopted because it was the language of all America.\" In  reality the three-fifths rule was a mere incident in that part of  the great compromise which declared that \"representation should be  proportioned according to direct taxation.\" As a further indication of  the attitude of the Convention upon this point, an amendment to have the  blacks counted equally with the whites was voted down by eight States  against two.    With the adoption of the great compromise a marked difference was  noticeable in the attitude of the delegates. Those from the large States  were deeply disappointed at the result and they asked for an adjournment  to give them time to consider what they should do. The next morning,  before the Convention met, they held a meeting to determine upon  their course of action. They were apparently afraid of taking the  responsibility for breaking up the Convention, so they finally decided  to let the proceedings go on and to see what might be the ultimate  outcome. Rumors of these dissensions had reached the ears of the public,  and it may have been to quiet any misgivings that the following inspired  item appeared in several local papers: \"So great is the unanimity, we  hear, that prevails in the Convention, upon all great federal subjects,  that it has been proposed to call the room in which they assemble  Unanimity Hall.\"    On the other hand the effect of this great compromise upon the delegates  from the small States was distinctly favorable. Having obtained equal  representation in one branch of the legislature, they now proceeded with  much greater willingness to consider the strengthening of the central  government. Many details were yet to be arranged, and sharp differences  of opinion existed in connection with the executive as well as with the  judiciary. But these difficulties were slight in comparison with those  which they had already surmounted in the matter of representation. By  the end of July the fifteen resolutions of the original Virginia  Plan had been increased to twenty-three, with many enlargements and  amendments, and the Convention had gone as far as it could effectively  in determining the general principles upon which the government should  be formed. There were too many members to work efficiently when it came  to the actual framing of a constitution with all the inevitable details  that were necessary in setting up a machinery of government. Accordingly  this task was turned over to a committee of five members who had already  given evidence of their ability in this direction. Rutledge was made the  chairman, and the others were Randolph, Gorham, Ellsworth, and Wilson.  To give them time to perfect their work, on the 26th of July the  Convention adjourned for ten days.        CHAPTER VII. FINISHING THE WORK    Rutledge and his associates on the committee of detail accomplished so  much in such a short time that it seems as if they must have worked day  and night. Their efforts marked a distinct stage in the development of  the Constitution. The committee left no records, but some of the members  retained among their private papers drafts of the different stages of  the report they were framing, and we are therefore able to surmise the  way in which the committee proceeded. Of course the members were bound  by the resolutions which had been adopted by the Convention and they  held themselves closely to the general principles that had been laid  down. But in the elaboration of details they seem to have begun with the  Articles of Confederation and to have used all of that document that was  consistent with the new plan of government. Then they made use of the  New Jersey Plan, which had been put forward by the smaller States, and  of a third plan which had been presented by Charles Pinckney; for the  rest they drew largely upon the State Constitutions. By a combination  of these different sources the committee prepared a document bearing a  close resemblance to the present Constitution, although subjects were in  a different order and in somewhat different proportions, which, at the  end of ten days, by working on Sunday, they were able to present to  the Convention. This draft of a constitution was printed on seven folio  pages with wide margins for notes and emendations.    The Convention resumed its sessions on Monday, the 6th of August, and  for five weeks the report of the committee of detail was the subject of  discussion. For five hours each day, and sometimes for six hours, the  delegates kept persistently at their task. It was midsummer, and we read  in the diary of one of the members that in all that period only five  days were \"cool.\" Item by item, line by line, the printed draft of the  Constitution was considered. It is not possible, nor is it necessary, to  follow that work minutely; much of it was purely formal, and yet any one  who has had experience with committee reports knows how much importance  attaches to matters of phrasing. Just as the Virginia Plan was made  more acceptable to the majority by changes in wording that seem to us  insignificant, so modifications in phrasing slowly won support for the  draft of the Constitution.    The adoption of the great compromise, as we have seen, changed the whole  spirit of the Convention. There was now an expectation on the part of  the members that something definite was going to be accomplished, and  all were concerned in making the result as good and as acceptable  as possible. In other words, the spirit of compromise pervaded every  action, and it is essential to remember this in considering what was  accomplished.    One of the greatest weaknesses of the Confederation was the inefficiency  of Congress. More than four pages, or three-fifths of the whole printed  draft, were devoted to Congress and its powers. It is more significant,  however, that in the new Constitution the legislative powers of the  Confederation were transferred bodily to the Congress of the United  States, and that the powers added were few in number, although of course  of the first importance. The Virginia Plan declared that, in addition to  the powers under the Confederation, Congress should have the right \"to  legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent.\"  This statement was elaborated in the printed draft which granted  specific powers of taxation, of regulating commerce, of establishing  a uniform rule of naturalization, and at the end of the enumeration of  powers two clauses were added giving to Congress authority:    \"To call forth the aid of the militia, in order to execute the laws  of the Union, enforce treaties, suppress insurrections, and repel  invasions;    \"And to make all laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying  into execution the foregoing powers.\"    On the other hand, it was necessary to place some limitations upon  the power of Congress. A general restriction was laid by giving to  the executive a right of veto, which might be overruled, however, by a  two-thirds vote of both houses. Following British tradition yielding  as it were to an inherited fear--these delegates in America were led to  place the first restraint upon the exercise of congressional authority  in connection with treason. The legislature of the United States was  given the power to"]]]
