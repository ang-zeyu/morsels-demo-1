S Llano,      3500 ft., 1.      =Urocyon cinereoargenteus californicus= Mearns    Gray Fox    The gray fox is widely distributed in the San Gabriel Mountains,  occurring on both slopes of the range wherever extensive tracts of  chaparral are present. They reach maximum abundance in the chaparral  association of the coastal slope. Individuals have been observed  occasionally at night in coastal sage areas at the Pacific foot of the  mountains; however they seem to be less common here and probably come  out of the adjacent chaparral to forage in the flats at night. Gray  foxes occur all the way up the Pacific slope into the yellow pine  woodland at 7500 feet, and from 6200 feet elevation on the desert slope  down to the upper limit of the Joshua trees as, for example, near Mescal  Canyon at 4700 feet.    On the Pacific face of the mountains the gray fox probably is the  dominant carnivore in terms of its effect on prey species, first,  because of its abundance, and second, because of its forage habits. Some  appreciation of the abundance of the gray fox may be gained from  trapping records. On a fire road at the head of Thompson Canyon, at 2500  feet, two settings of traps about one-quarter mile apart were maintained  for four nights. In this time four gray foxes were trapped. At the head  of Cow Canyon, at 4500 feet, one trap set on a deer trail caught five  gray foxes in five nights. At the end of this time fox tracks were noted  about 100 yards away from the set, and another fox was trapped about one  quarter mile away. In addition to their abundance, the forage habits of  gray foxes are such as to bring them into most habitats present in the  chaparral association. Tracks and feces indicate that foxes forage under  dense brush, on open rocky ridges, in riparian growth, on talus slopes,  and in groves of big cone-spruce and scrub oak.    Trapped foxes, if uninjured by the trap, were usually released. One fox  was released on a small trail through thick vegetation consisting mainly  of snowbrush. When freed, the fox whirled and darted through a patch of  snowbrush for about seventy-five feet, then turned and disappeared  beneath some large bay trees. Although the brush through which it ran  was dense, the fox seemed to run at full speed. The success of gray  foxes as predators in the chaparral is probably due in large measure to  their agility amid dense cover.    The three specimens from the desert slope are referable to the coastal  subspecies, _U. c. californicus_, rather than the desert subspecies, _U.  c. scottii_. In all respects they resemble foxes taken on the Pacific  slope; cranial measurements are near the maximum for the large _U. c.  californicus_, and not small as would be expected if they were grading  toward the smaller _U. c. scottii_. Floors of desert valleys north of  the San Gabriel Mountains probably isolated foxes there from _U. c.  scottii_ found in the higher ranges of the Mojave Desert. Consequently  one would expect no intergradation between the coastal and desert races  in the San Gabriel Mountains.    An old female trapped on March 18,1951, in San Antonio Canyon, had three  embryos each about 105 mm. long from rump to crown, and weighed 9.2 lbs.  The average weight of four non-pregnant females was 6.8 lbs., whereas  the average of six males was 7.5 lbs.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4800 ft., 1; 4 mi. E Valyermo,      5200 ft., 2; Cow Canyon, 4500 ft., 2; San Antonio Canyon, 3000      ft., 1; Thompson Canyon, 2500 ft., 2 (PC); 1/2 mi. W Palmer      Canyon, 2000 ft., 3 (PC).      Family FELIDAE      =Lynx rufus californicus= Mearns    Wildcat    Wildcats range over the whole of the San Gabriel Range, with the  possible exception of the tops of the highest peaks such as Mt. San  Antonio and Mt. Baden Powell. Sign of these animals has been observed,  or specimens have been taken, from the coastal sage belt up to about  8500 feet in the yellow pine forests on Blue Ridge. The subspecies  _baileyi_ occurs on the desert slope of the range.    Wildcats are most common in the chaparral belt where they forage widely  from the ridges down into the canyons. Judging from trapping records  bobcats are not so common here as the gray fox.    Bobcats occur in the sage belt, where they are most common in the broken  country around washes and in brushy areas. Although bobcats and coyotes  occupy the same general areas here, the habitat preferences of these  animals seem to be different, with coyotes occupying the more open  country. An indication of the hunting habits of bobcats is furnished by  the occurrence of masses of prickly-pear thorns beneath the skin of the  legs, particularly the forelegs, of three specimens trapped in the sage  belt. These thorns probably were acquired while the bobcats foraged for  woodrats or cottontails in the patches of prickly-pear, which are  locally abundant in the sage belt.    On March 12, 1951, a small subadult female bobcat, trapped at 4000 feet  in San Antonio Canyon, was found dead in the trap and had numerous deep  cuts around its head and shoulders, and severe bruises on the right  shoulder. The spacing of the cuts, and the tracks around the set,  indicated that while held in the trap this animal had fought with a  second bobcat that had inflicted the fatal wounds. It seems unlikely  that the fight was caused by a male attempting to copulate with the  female held in the trap, for the female was found to be carrying an  embryo.    In Live Oak Canyon, in December, 1950, tracks and bits of fur indicated  that a bobcat had killed and eaten a gray squirrel. Remains of  cottontails were found in the stomachs of two bobcats. All six bobcats  from the Pacific slope had nematode worms in the pyloric end of the  stomach.    Two females obtained on March 12 and 19, 1951, each had one embryo  approximately one inch long (rump to crown).    The following list gives the weight of each of the specimens from the  Pacific slope of the San Gabriels.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 8, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 4000 ft., 1; San Antonio      Canyon, 3200 ft., 1; 4 mi.

Tracks were  observed on many occasions in yellow pine forest, but wildcats seemed to  be commonest in the brushy parts of the pinyon-juniper association. Two  were trapped in small draws lined with pinyons and scrub oak, and two  at the base of rocky pinyon-covered slopes. Only occasionally were  tracks noted in the lower part of the juniper belt. Bobcats are most  numerous where woodrats also reach peak abundance, suggesting that  woodrats are a major food.    The four specimens from the desert slope, although exhibiting a wide  range of variation, are all representatives of the desert race  _baileyi_. A yearling male from near the head of Grandview Canyon, at  5200 feet elevation, has the profuse black spotting of the subspecies  _californicus_, but the general pallor dorsally is characteristic of the  desert subspecies. An adult female, from 4700 feet elevation in Graham  Canyon, shows the double mid-dorsal black line and the distinct black  markings around the face characteristic of _californicus_, but is  otherwise pale with reduced black patterns on the backs of the ears. The  other two specimens, an adult male and a yearling female, are typical  examples of _baileyi_, pale, and with reduced black markings. None of  the specimens of bobcats from the coastal slope of the mountains showed  characters approaching those of _baileyi_. It seems, therefore, that  these two subspecies intergrade on the interior slope of the range.    A yearling male weighed 12 pounds, and a yearling female weighed 10.5  pounds. An old male weighed 19.6 pounds, and an adult female weighed  15.1 pounds.    Remains of deer were in two of the bobcat stomachs, and one of these  stomachs also contained jack rabbit remains. Approximately a dozen  nematodes (stomach worms) were in the stomach of one of the larger male  specimens.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 4, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4800 ft., 1; Graham Canyon, 4700      ft., 1; Grandview Canyon, 5200 ft., 2.      =Felis concolor californica= May    Mountain Lion    Several cabin owners near the mouth of Icehouse Canyon reported seeing a  lion in that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#16)"],[1,"metamorphosed one another into stone  and lumps of oak. The question is, Where are the spirits of these Druids  now? Their spirits are wafted through the air, and the man or beast they  meet is smitten, while their own bodies are still under enchantment. I  had such a Druid enchantment in my hand; it wasn't stone, nor marble,  nor flint, and had human shape. It was found in the centre of a big rock  on Innis-na-Gore; and round this rock light used to appear at night. The  man who owned the stone decided to blast it up, and he found at its  centre the enchantment--just like a man, with head and legs and  arms.[18] Father Healy took the enchantment away, when he was here on a  visit, and said that it was a Druid enchanted, and that to get out of  the rock was one part of the releasement, and that there would be a  second and complete releasement of the Druid.'    _The Fairy Tribes Classified._--Finally I asked Patrick to classify, as  far as he could, all the fairy tribes he had ever heard about, and he  said:--'The leprechaun is a red-capped fellow who stays round pure  springs, generally shoemaking for the rest of the fairy tribes. The  lunantishees are the tribes that guard the blackthorn trees or sloes;  they let you cut no stick on the eleventh of November (the original  November Day), or on the eleventh of May (the original May Day). If at  such a time you cut a blackthorn, some misfortune will come to you.  Pookas are black-featured fellows mounted on good horses; and are  horse-dealers. They visit racecourses, but usually are invisible. The  _gentry_ are the most noble tribe of all; and they are a big race who  came from the planets--according to my idea; they usually appear white.  The _Daoine Maithe_ (though there is some doubt, the same or almost the  same as the _gentry_) were next to Heaven at the Fall, but did not fall;  they are a people expecting salvation.'      BRIDGET O'CONNER'S TESTIMONY    Our next witness is Bridget O'Conner, a near neighbour to Patrick  Waters, in Cloontipruckilish. When I approached her neat little cottage  she was cutting sweet-pea blossoms with a pair of scissors, and as I  stopped to tell her how pretty a garden she had, she searched out the  finest white bloom she could find and gave it to me. After we had talked  a little while about America and Ireland, she said I must come in and  rest a few minutes, and so I did; and it was not long before we were  talking about fairies:--    _The Irish Legend of the Dead._--'Old Peggy Gillin, dead these thirty  years, who lived a mile beyond Grange, used to cure people with a secret  herb shown to her by her brother, dead of a fairy-stroke. He was drowned  and _taken_ by the fairies, in the big drowning here during the herring  season. She would pull the herb herself and prepare it by mixing spring  water with it. Peggy could always talk with her dead relatives and  friends, and continually with her brother, and she would tell everybody  that they were with the fairies. Her daughter, Mary Short, who inherited  some of her mother's power, died here about three or four years ago.    'I remember, too, about Mary Leonard and her daughter, Nancy Waters.  Both of them are dead now. The daughter was the first to die, as it  happened, and in child-birth. When she was gone, her mother used to wail  and cry in an awful manner; and one day the daughter appeared to her in  the garden, and said, \"The more you wail for me, the more I am in  torment. Pray for me, but do not wail.\"'    _A Midwife Story._--'A country nurse was requested by a strange man on  horseback to go with him to exercise her profession; and she went with  him to a castle she didn't know. When the baby was born, every woman in  the place where the event happened put her finger in a basin of water  and rubbed her eyes, and so the nurse put her finger in and rubbed it on  one of her eyes. She went home and thought no more about it. But one day  she was at the fair in Grange and saw some of the same women who were in  the castle when the baby was born; though, as she noticed, she only  could see them with the one eye she had wet with the water from the  basin. The nurse spoke to the women, and they wanted to know how she  recognized them; and she, in reply, said it was with the one eye, and  asked, \"How is the baby?\" \"Well,\" said one of the fairy women; \"and what  eye do you see us with?\" \"With the left eye,\" answered the nurse. Then  the fairy woman blew her breath against the nurse's left eye, and said,  \"You'll never see me again.\" And the nurse was always blind in the left  eye after that.'      THE SPIRIT WORLD AT CARNS    The Carns or Mount Temple country, about three miles from Grange, County  Sligo, has already been mentioned by witnesses as a 'gentry' haunt, and  so now we shall hear what one of its oldest and most intelligent native  inhabitants says of it. John McCann had been referred to, by Patrick  Waters, as one who knows much about the 'gentry' at first hand, and we  can be sure that what he offers us is thoroughly reliable evidence. For  many years, John McCann, born in 1830, by profession a carpenter and  boat-builder, has been official mail-carrier to Innishmurray; and he  knows quite as much about the strange little island and the mainland  opposite it as any man living. His neat little cottage is on the shore  of the bay opposite the beautiful fairy-haunted Darnish Island; and, as  we sat within it beside a brilliant peat fire, and surrounded by all the  family, this is what was told me:--    _A 'Gentry' Medium._--'Ketty Rourk (or Queenan) could tell all that  would happen--funerals, weddings, and so forth. Sure some spirits were  coming to her. She said they were the _gentry_; that the _gentry_ are  everywhere; and that my drowned uncles and grandfather and other dead  are among them. A drowned man named Pat Nicholson was her adviser. He  used to live just a mile from here; and she knew him before he was  drowned.'    Here we have, clearly enough, a case of 'mediumship', or of  communication with the dead, as in modern Spiritualism. And the  following story, which like this last has numerous Irish parallels,  illustrates an ancient and world-wide animistic belief, that in  sickness--as in dreams--the soul goes out of the body as at death, and  meets the dead in their own fairy world.    _The Clairvoyance of Mike Farrell._--'Mike Farrell, too, could tell all  about the _gentry_, as he lay sick a long time. And he told about Father  Brannan's youth, and even the house in Roscommon in which the Father was  born; and Father Brannan never said anything more against Mike after  that. Mike surely saw the _gentry_; and he was with them during his  illness for twelve months. He said they live in _forts_ and at Alt Darby  (\"the Big Rock\"). After he got well, he went to America, at the time of  the famine.'    _The 'Gentry' Army._--'The _gentry_ were believed to live up on this  hill (Hill of the Brocket Stones, _Cluach-a-brac_), and from it they  would come out like an army and march along the road to the strand. Very  few persons could see them. They were thought to be like living people,  but in different dress. They seemed like soldiers, yet it was known they  were not living beings such as we are.'    _The Seership of Dan Quinn._--'On Connor's Island (about two miles  southward from Carns by the mainland) my uncle, Dan Quinn, often used to  see big crowds of the _gentry_ come into his house and play music and  dance. The house would be full of them, but they caused him no fear.  Once on such an occasion, one of them came up to him as he lay in bed,  and giving him a green leaf told him to put it in his mouth. When he did  this, instantly he could not see the _gentry_, but could still hear  their music. Uncle Dan always believed he recognized in some of the  _gentry_ his drowned friends. Only when he was alone would the _gentry_  visit him. He was a silent old man, and so never talked much; but I know  that this story is as true as can be, and that the _gentry_ always took  an interest in him.'      UNDER THE SHADOW OF BEN BULBIN AND BEN WASKIN    I was driving along the Ben Bulbin road, on the ocean side, with Michael  Oates, who was on his way from his mountain-side home to the lowlands to  cut hay; and as we looked up at the ancient mountain, so mysterious and  silent in the shadows and fog of a calm early morning of summer, he told  me about its invisible inhabitants:--    _The 'Gentry' Huntsmen._--'I knew a man who saw the _gentry_ hunting on  the other side of the mountain. He saw hounds and horsemen cross the  road and jump the hedge in front of him, and it was one o'clock at  night. The next day he passed the place again, and looked for the tracks  of the huntsmen, but saw not a trace of tracks at all.'    _The 'Taking' of the Turf-Cutter._--After I had heard about two boys who  were drowned opposite Innishmurray, and who afterwards appeared as  apparitions, for the _gentry_ had them, this curious story was  related:--'A man was cutting turf out on the side of Ben Bulbin when a  strange man came to him and said, \"You have cut enough turf for to-day.  You had better stop and go home.\" The turf-cutter looked around in  surprise, and in two seconds the strange man had disappeared; but he  decided to go home. And as soon as he was home, such a feeling came over  him that he could not tell whether he was alive or dead. Then he took to  his bed and never rose again.'    _Hearing the 'Gentry' Music._--At this Michael said to his companion in  the cart with us, William Barber, 'You tell how you heard the music';  and this followed:--'One dark night, about one o'clock, myself and  another young man were passing along the road up there round Ben Bulbin,  when we heard the finest kind of music. All sorts of music seemed to be  playing. We could see nothing at all, though we thought we heard voices  like children's. It was the music of the _gentry_ we heard.'   "]]]
