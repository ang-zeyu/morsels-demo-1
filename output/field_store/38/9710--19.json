[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#16)"],[1," preparations to  begin. Much form and circumstance were necessary in settling  preliminaries; and as we were in no hurry to get rid of our subjects,  we had more formalities than usual to go through with.    Our first subject was the lady of the poetical name. It was necessary  to hold a consultation upon her costume, whether the colours were  pretty and such as would be brought out well or not; whether a scarf  around the neck was advisable; whether the hair was well arranged, the  rose becoming, and in the best position; then to change it, and  consider the effect of the change, and to say and do many other things  which may suggest themselves to the reader's imagination, and all which  gave rise to many profound remarks in regard to artistical effect, and  occupied much time.    The lady being arrayed to the best advantage, it was necessary to seat  her with reference to a right adjustment of light and shade; to examine  carefully the falling of the light upon her face; then to consult  whether it was better to take a front or a side view; to look at the  face carefully in both positions; and, finally, it was necessary to  secure the head in the right position; that it should be neither too  high nor too low; too much on one side nor on the other; and as this  required great nicety, it was sometimes actually indispensable to turn  the beautiful little head with our own hands, which, however, was a  very innocent way of turning a young lady's head.    Next it was necessary to get the young lady into focus--that is, to get  her into the box, which, in short; means, to get a reflection of her  face on the glass in the camera obscura at that one particular point of  view which presented it better than any other; and when this was  obtained, the miniatured likeness of the object was so faithfully  reflected, that, as artists carried away by enthusiasm, we were obliged  to call in the papas and mammas, who pronounced it beautiful--to which  dictum we were in courtesy obliged to respond.    The plate was now cleaned, put into the box, and the light shut off.  Now came a trying time for the young lady. She must neither open her  lips nor roll her eyes for one minute and thirty seconds by the watch.  This eternity at length ended, and the plate was taken out.    So far our course had been before the wind. Every new formality had but  increased our importance in the eyes of our fair visiters and their  respectable companions. Mr. Catherwood retired to the adjoining room to  put the plate in the mercury bath, while we, not knowing what the  result might be, a little fearful, and neither wishing to rob another  of the honour he might be justly entitled to, not to be dragged down by  another's failure, thought best to have it distinctly understood that  Mr. Catherwood was the maestro, and that we were merely amateurs. At  the same time, on Mr. Catherwood's account, I took occasion to suggest  that the process was so complicated, and its success depended upon such  a variety of minute circumstances, it seemed really wonderful that it  ever turned out well. The plate might not be good, or not well cleaned;  or the chemicals might not be of the best; or the plate might be left  too long in the iodine box, or taken out too soon; or left too long in  the bromine box, or taken out too soon; or a ray of light might strike  it on putting it into the camera or in taking it out; or it might be  left too long in the camera or taken out too soon; or too long in the  mercury bath or taken out too soon; and even though all these processes  were right and regular, there might be some other fault of omission or  commission which we were not aware of; besides which, climate and  atmosphere had great influence, and might render all of no avail. These  little suggestions we considered necessary to prevent too great a  disappointment in case of failure; and perhaps our fair visiters were  somewhat surprised at our audacity in undertaking at all such a  doubtful experiment, and using them as instruments. The result,  however, was enough to induce us never again to adopt prudential  measures, for the young lady's image was stamped upon the plate, and  made a picture which enchanted her and satisfied the critical judgment  of her friends and admirers.    Our experiments upon the other ladies were equally successful, and the  morning glided away in this pleasant occupation.    We continued practising a few days longer; and as all our good results  were extensively shown, and the poor ones we took care to keep out of  sight, our reputation increased, and we had abundance of applications.    In this state of things we requested some friends to whom we were under  many obligations, to be permitted to wait upon them at their houses. On  receiving their assent, the next morning at nine o'clock Mr. C. in a  caleza, with all the complicated apparatus packed around him, drove up  to their door. I followed on foot. It was our intention to go through  the whole family, uncles, aunts, grandchildren, down to Indian  servants, as many as would sit; but man is born to disappointment. I  spare the reader the recital of our misfortunes that day. It would be  too distressing. Suffice it to say that we tried plate after plate,  sitting after sitting, varying light, time, and other points of the  process; but it was all in vain. The stubborn instrument seemed bent  upon confounding us; and, covering our confusion as well as we could,  we gathered up our Daguerreotype and carried ourselves off. What was  the cause of our complete discomfiture we never ascertained, but we  resolved to give up business as ladies' Daguerreotype portrait takers.    There was one interesting incident connected with our short career of  practice. Among the portraits put forth was one of a lady, which came  to the knowledge of a gentleman particularly interested in the fair  original. This gentleman had never taken any especial notice of us  before, but now he called upon us, and very naturally the conversation  turned upon that art of which we were then professors. The portrait of  this lady was mentioned, and by the time he had finished his third  straw cigar, he unburdened himself of the special object of his visit,  which was to procure a portrait of her for himself. This seemed natural  enough, and we assented, provided he would get her to sit; but he did  not wish either her or her friends to know anything about it. This was  a difficulty. It was not very easy to take it by stealth. However  strong an impression a young lady may make by a glance upon some  substances, she can do nothing upon a silver plate. Here she requires  the aid of iodine, bromine, and mercury. But the young man was fertile  in expedients. He said that we could easily make some excuse, promising  her something more perfect, and in making two or three impressions,  could slip one away for him. This was by no means a bad suggestion, at  least so far as he was concerned, but we had some qualms of conscience.  While we were deliberating, a matter was introduced which perhaps lay  as near Doctor Cabot's heart as the young lady did that of our friend.  That was a pointer or setter dog for hunting, of which the doctor  was in great want. The gentleman said he had one-the only one in  Merida--and he would give it for the portrait. It was rather an odd  proposition, but to offer a dog for his mistress's portrait was very  different from offering his mistress's portrait for a dog. It was clear  that the young man was in a bad way; he would lay down his life, give  up smoking, part with his dog, or commit any other extravagance. The  case was touching. The doctor was really interested; and, after all,  what harm could it do? The doctor and I went to look at the dog, but it  turned out to be a mere pup, entirely unbroken, and what the result  might have been I do not know, but all farther negotiations were broken  off by the result of our out-of-door practice and disgust for the  business.    There is no immediate connexion between taking Daguerreotype portraits  and the practice of surgery, but circumstances bring close together  things entirely dissimilar in themselves, and we went from one to the  other. Secluded as Merida is, and seldom visited by strangers, the fame  of new discoveries in science is slow in reaching it, and the new  operation of Mons. Guerin for the cure of strabismus had not been heard  of. In private intercourse we had spoken of this operation, and, in  order to make it known, and extend its benefits, Doctor Cabot had  offered to perform it in Merida. The Merida people have generally fine  eyes, but, either because our attention was particularly directed to  it, or that it is really the case, there seemed to be more squinting  eyes, or biscos, as they are called, than are usually seen in any one  town, and in Merida, as in some other places, this is not esteemed a  beauty; but, either from want of confidence in a stranger, or a cheap  estimation of the qualifications of a medico who asked no pay for his  services, the doctor's philanthropic purposes were not appreciated. At  least, no one cared to be the first; and as the doctor had no sample of  his skill with him, no subject offered.    We had fixed the day for our departure; and the evening but one before,  a direct overture was made to the doctor to perform the operation. The  subject was a boy, and the application in his behalf was made by a  gentleman who formed one of a circle in which we were in the habit of  visiting, and whom we were all happy to have it in our power to serve.    The time was fixed at ten o'clock the next day. After breakfast our  sala was put in order for the reception of company, and the doctor for  the first time looked to his instruments. He had some misgivings. They  were of very fine workmanship, made in Paris, most sensitive to the  influence of the atmosphere, and in that climate it was almost  impossible to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#16)"],[1,"at night, and the  communication trenches to which our men moved up to the front lines,  and gun-positions revealed by every flash, and dugouts foolishly frail  against their 5.9's, which in those early days we could only answer by  a few pip-squeaks. They made fixed targets of crossroads and points our  men were bound to pass, so that to our men those places became sinister  with remembered horror and present fear: Dead Horse Corner and Dead  Cow Farm, and the farm beyond Plug Street; Dead Dog Farm and the Moated  Grange on the way to St.-Eloi; Stinking Farm and Suicide Corner and  Shell-trap Barn, out by Ypres.    All the fighting youth of our race took their turn in those places,  searched along those roads, lived in ditches and dugouts there, under  constant fire. In wet holes along the Yser Canal by Ypres, young  officers who had known the decencies of home life tried to camouflage  their beastliness by giving a touch of decoration to the clammy walls.  They bought Kirchner prints of little ladies too lightly clad for the  climate of Flanders, and pinned them up as a reminder of the dainty  feminine side of life which here was banished. They brought broken  chairs and mirrors from the ruins of Ypres, and said, \"It's quite cozy,  after all!\"    And they sat there chatting, as in St. James's Street clubs, in the same  tone of voice, with the same courtesy and sense of humor--while they  listened to noises without, and wondered whether it would be to-day or  to-morrow, or in the middle of the sentence they were speaking, that  bits of steel would smash through that mud above their heads and tear  them to bits and make a mess of things.    There was an officer of the Coldstream Guards who sat in one of these  holes, like many others. A nice, gentle fellow, fond of music, a fine  judge of wine, a connoisseur of old furniture and good food. It was  cruelty to put such a man into a hole in the earth, like the ape-houses  of Hagenbeck's Zoo. He had been used to comfort, the little luxuries  of court life. There, on the canal-bank, he refused to sink into the  squalor. He put on pajamas at night before sleeping in his bunk--silk  pajamas--and while waiting for his breakfast smoked his own brand of  gold-tipped cigarettes, until one morning a big shell blew out the  back of his dugout and hurled him under a heap of earth and timber. He  crawled out, cursing loudly with a nice choice of language, and then lit  another gold--tipped cigarette, and called to his servant for breakfast.  His batman was a fine lad, brought up in the old traditions of service  to an officer of the Guards, and he provided excellent little meals,  done to a turn, until something else happened, and he was buried alive  within a few yards of his master... Whenever I went to the canal-bank,  and I went there many times (when still and always hungry high  velocities came searching for a chance meal), I thought of my friend  in the Guards, and of other men I knew who had lived there in the worst  days, and some of whom had died there. They hated that canal-bank and  dreaded it, but they jested in their dugouts, and there was the laughter  of men who hid the fear in their hearts and were \"game\" until some  bit of steel plugged them with a gaping wound or tore their flesh to  tatters.          VI      Because the enemy was on the high ground and our men were in the low  ground, many of our trenches were wet and waterlogged, even in summer,  after heavy rain. In winter they were in bogs and swamps, up by St.-Eloi  and southward this side of Gommecourt, and in many other evil places.  The enemy drained his water into our ditches when he could, with the  cunning and the science of his way of war, and that made our men savage.    I remember going to the line this side of Fricourt on an August day in  '15. It was the seventeenth of August, as I have it in my diary, and  the episode is vivid in my mind because I saw then the New Army lads  learning one of the lessons of war in one of the foulest places. I also  learned the sense of humor of a British general, and afterward, not  enjoying the joke, the fatalistic valor of officers and men (in civil  life a year before) who lived with the knowledge that the ground beneath  them was mined and charged with high explosives, and might hurl them to  eternity between the whiffs of a cigarette.    We were sitting in the garden of the general's headquarters, having a  picnic meal before going into the trenches. In spite of the wasps, which  attacked the sandwiches, it was a nice, quiet place in time of war.  No shell same crashing in our neighborhood (though we were well within  range of the enemy's guns), and the loudest noise was the drop of an  over-ripe apple in the orchard. Later on a shrill whistle signaled a  hostile airplane overhead, but it passed without throwing a bomb.    \"You will have a moist time in some of the trenches,\" said the general  (whose boots were finely polished). \"The rain has made them rather  damp... But you must get down as far as the mine craters. We're  expecting the Germans to fire one at any moment, and some of our  trenches are only six yards away from the enemy. It's an interesting  place.\"    The interest of it seemed to me too much of a good thing, and I uttered  a pious prayer that the enemy would not explode his beastly mine under  me. It makes such a mess of a man.    A staff captain came out with a report, which he read: \"The sound of  picks has been heard close to our sap-head. The enemy will probably  explode their mine in a few hours.\"    \"That's the place I was telling you about,\" said the general. \"It's well  worth a visit... But you must make up your mind to get your feet wet.\"    As long as I could keep my head dry and firmly fixed to my shoulders, I  was ready to brave the perils of wet feet with any man.    It had been raining heavily for a day or two. I remember thinking that  in London--which seemed a long way off--people were going about under  umbrellas and looking glum when their clothes were splashed by passing  omnibuses. The women had their skirts tucked up and showed their pretty  ankles. (Those things used to happen in the far-off days of peace.) But  in the trenches, those that lay low, rain meant something different, and  hideously uncomfortable for men who lived in holes. Our soldiers,  who cursed the rain--as in the old days, \"they swore terribly in  Flanders\"--did not tuck their clothes up above their ankles. They took  off their trousers.    There was something ludicrous, yet pitiable, in the sight of those hefty  men coming back through the communication trenches with the tails of  their shirts flapping above their bare legs, which were plastered with a  yellowish mud. Shouldering their rifles or their spades, they trudged on  grimly through two feet of water, and the boots which they wore without  socks squelched at every step with a loud, sucking noise--\"like a German  drinking soup,\" said an officer who preceded me.    \"Why grouse?\" he said, presently. \"It's better than Brighton!\"    It was a queer experience, this paddling through the long communication  trenches, which wound in and out like the Hampton Court maze toward the  front line, and the mine craters which made a salient to our right, by  a place called the \"Tambour.\" Shells came whining overhead and somewhere  behind us iron doors were slamming in the sky, with metallic bangs, as  though opening and shutting in a tempest. The sharp crack of rifle-shots  showed that the snipers were busy on both sides, and once I stood in a  deep pool, with the water up to my knees, listening to what sounded like  the tap-tap-tap of invisible blacksmiths playing a tattoo on an anvil.    It was one of our machine-guns at work a few yards away from my head,  which I ducked below the trench parapet. Splodge! went the officer  in front of me, with a yell of dismay. The water was well above his  top-boots. Splosh! went another man ahead, recovering from a side-slip  in the oozy mud and clinging desperately to some bunches of yarrow  growing up the side of the trench. Squelch! went a young gentleman whose  puttees and breeches had lost their glory and were but swabs about his  elegant legs.    \"Clever fellows!\" said the officer, as two of us climbed on to the  fire-stand of the trench in order to avoid a specially deep water-hole,  and with ducked heads and bodies bent double (the Germans were only two  hundred yards on the other side of the parapet) walked on dry earth for  at least ten paces. The officer's laughter was loud at the corner of  the next traverse, when there was an abrupt descent into a slough of  despond.    \"And I hope they can swim!\" said an ironical voice from a dugout, as the  officers passed. They were lying in wet mud in those square burrows, the  men who had been working all night under their platoon commanders, and  were now sleeping and resting in their trench dwellings. As I paddled  on I glanced at those men lying on straw which gave out a moist smell,  mixed with the pungent vapors of chloride of lime. They were not  interested in the German guns, which were giving their daily dose of  \"hate\" to the village of Becourt-Becordel. The noise did not interrupt  their heavy, slumbrous breathing. Some of those who were awake were  reading novelettes, forgetting war in the eternal plot of cheap romance.  Others sat at the entrance of their burrows with their knees tucked up,  staring gloomily to the opposite wall of the trench in day-dreams of  some places betwixt Aberdeen and Hackney Downs. I spoke to one of them,  and said, \"How are you getting on?\" He answered, \"I'm not getting on...  I don't see the fun of this.\"    \"Can you keep dry?\"    \"Dry?... I'm soaked to the skin.\"    \"What's it like here?\"    \"It's hell... The devils blow up mines to make things worse.\"    Another boy spoke.    \"Don't you mind what he says, sir. He's always a gloomy bastard. Doesn't  believe in his luck.\"  "]]]
