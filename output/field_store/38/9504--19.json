But, Oh, Mrs. Calvert, that is not the main thing that  has discomposed me, and shaken my nerves to pieces at this time. Who do  you think the young man was who walked in his company to-night?\"    \"I cannot for my life recollect, but am convinced I have seen the same  fine form and face before.\"    \"And did not he seem to know us, Mrs. Calvert? You who are able to  recollect things as they happened, did he not seem to recollect us, and  make signs to that effect?\"    \"He did, indeed, and apparently with great good humour.\"    \"Oh, Mrs Calvert, hold me, else I shall fall into hysterics again! Who  is he? Who is he? Tell me who you suppose he is, for I cannot say my  own thought.\"    \"On my life, I cannot remember.\"    \"Did you note the appearance of the young gentleman you saw slain that  night? Do you recollect aught of the appearance of my young master,  George Colwan?\"    Mrs. Calvert sat silent, and stared the other mildly in the face. Their  looks encountered, and there was an unearthly amazement that gleamed  from each, which, meeting together, caught real fire, and returned the  flame to their heated imaginations, till the two associates became like  two statues, with their hands spread, their eyes fixed, and their chops  fallen down upon their bosoms. An old woman who kept the lodging-house,  having been called in before when Mrs. Logan was faintish, chanced to  enter at this crisis with some cordial; and, seeing the state of her  lodgers, she caught the infection, and fell into the same rigid and  statue-like appearance. No scene more striking was ever exhibited; and  if Mrs. Calvert had not resumed strength of mind to speak, and break  the spell, it is impossible to say how long it might have continued.  \"It is he, I believe,\" said she, uttering the words as it were  inwardly. \"It can be none other but he. But, no, it is impossible! I  saw him stabbed through and through the heart; I saw him roll backward  on the green in his own blood, utter his last words, and groan away his  soul. Yet, if it is not he, who can it be?\"    \"It is he!\" cried Mrs. Logan, hysterically.    \"Yes, yes, it is he!\" cried the landlady, in unison.    \"It is who?\" said Mrs. Calvert. \"Whom do you mean, mistress?\"    \"Oh, I don't know! I don't know! I was affrighted.\"    \"Hold your peace then till you recover your senses, and tell me, if you  can, who that young gentleman is who keeps company with the new Laird  of Dalcastle?\"    \"Oh, it is he! It is he!\" screamed Mrs. Logan, wringing her hands.    \"Oh, it is he! It is he!\" cried the landlady, wringing hers.    Mrs. Calvert turned the latter gently and civilly out of the apartment,  observing that there seemed to be some infection in the air of the  room, and she would be wise for herself to keep out of it.    The two dames had a restless and hideous night. Sleep came not to their  relief, for their conversation was wholly about the dead, who seemed to  be alive, and their minds were wandering and groping in a chaos of  mystery. \"Did you attend to his corpse, and know that he positively  died and was buried?\" said Mrs. Calvert.    \"Oh, yes, from the moment that his fair but mangled corpse was brought  home, I attended it till that when it was screwed in the coffin. I  washed the long stripes of blood from his lifeless form, on both sides  of the body. I bathed the livid wound that passed through his generous  and gentle heart. There was one through the flesh of his left side too,  which had bled most outwardly of them all. I bathed them, and bandaged  them up with wax and perfumed ointment, but still the blood oozed  through all, so that when he was laid in the coffin he was like one  newly murdered. My brave, my generous young master. He was always as a  son to me, and no son was ever more kind or more respectful to a  mother. But he was butchered--he was cut off from the earth ere he had  well reached to manhood--most barbarously and unfairly slain. And how  is it, how can it be, that we again see him here, walking arm in arm  with his murderer?\"    \"The thing cannot be, Mrs. Logan. It is a phantasy of our disturbed  imaginations, therefore let us compose ourselves till we investigate  this matter farther.\"    \"It cannot be in nature, that is quite clear,\" said Mrs. Logan. \"Yet  how it should be that I should think so--I who knew and nursed him from  his infancy--there lies the paradox. As you said once before, we have  nothing but our senses to depend on, and, if you and I believe that we  see a person, why, we do see him. Whose word, or whose reasoning can  convince us against our own senses? We will disguise ourselves as poor  women selling a few country wares, and we will go up to the Hall, and  see what is to see, and hear what we can hear, for this is a weighty  business in which we are engaged, namely, to turn the vengeance of the  law upon an unnatural monster; and we will further learn, if we can,  who this is that accompanies him.\"    Mrs. Calvert acquiesced, and the two dames took their way to Dalcastle,  with baskets well furnished with trifles. They did not take the common  path from the village, but went about, and approached the mansion by a  different way. But it seemed as if some overruling power ordered it  that they should miss no chance of attaining the information they  wanted. For ere ever they came within half a mile of Dalcastle they  perceived the two youths coming as to meet them, on the same path. The  road leading from Dalcastle towards the north-east, as all the country  knows, goes along a dark bank of brush-wood called the Bogle-heuch. It  was by this track that the two women were going, and, when they  perceived the two gentlemen meeting them, they turned back, and, the  moment they were out of their sight, they concealed themselves in a  thicket close by the road. They did this because Mrs. Logan was  terrified for being discovered, and because they wished to reconnoitre  without being seen. Mrs. Calvert now charged her, whatever she saw, or  whatever she heard, to put on a resolution, and support it, for if she  fainted there and was discovered, what was to become of her!    The two young men came on, in earnest and vehement conversation; but  the subject they were on was a terrible one, and hardly fit to be  repeated in the face of a Christian community. Wringhim was disputing  the boundlessness of the true Christian's freedom, and expressing  doubts that, chosen as he knew he was from all eternity, still it might  be possible for him to commit acts that would exclude him from the  limits of the covenant. The other argued, with mighty fluency, that the  thing was utterly impossible, and altogether inconsistent with eternal  predestination. The arguments of the latter prevailed, and the laird  was driven to sullen silence. But, to the women's utter surprise, as  the conquering disputant passed, he made a signal of recognizance  through the brambles to them, as formerly, and, that he might expose  his associate fully, and in his true colours, he led him back, wards  and forwards by the women more than twenty times, making him to confess  both the crimes that he had done and those he had in contemplation. At  length he said to him: \"Assuredly I saw some strolling vagrant women on  this walk, my dear friend: I wish we could find them, for there is  little doubt that they are concealed here in your woods.\"    \"I wish we could find them,\" answered Wringhim. \"We would have fine  sport maltreating and abusing them.\"    \"That we should, that we should! Now tell me, Robert, if you found a  malevolent woman, the latent enemy of your prosperity, lurking in these  woods to betray you, what would you inflict on her?\"    \"I would tear her to pieces with my dogs, and feed them with her flesh.  Oh, my dear friend, there is an old strumpet who lived with my  unnatural father, whom I hold in such utter detestation that I stand  constantly in dread of her, and would sacrifice the half of my estate  to shed her blood!\"    \"What will you give me if I will put her in your power, and give you a  fair and genuine excuse for making away with her; one for which you  shall answer at the bar, here or hereafter?\"    \"I should like to see the vile hag put down. She is in possession of  the family plate, that is mine by right, as well as a thousand valuable  relics, and great riches besides, all of which the old profligate  gifted shamefully away. And it is said, besides all these, that she has  sworn my destruction.\"    \"She has, she has. But I see not how she can accomplish that, seeing  the deed was done so suddenly, and in the silence of the night.\"    \"It was said there were some onlookers. But where shall we find that  disgraceful Miss Logan?\"    \"I will show you her by and by. But will you then consent to the other  meritorious deed? Come, be a man, and throw away scruples.\"    \"If you can convince me that the promise is binding I will.\"    \"Then step this way, till I give you a piece of information.\"    They walked a little way out of hearing, but went not out of sight;  therefore, though the women were in a terrible quandary, they durst not  stir, for they had some hopes that this extraordinary person was on a  mission of the same sort with themselves, knew of them, and was going  to make use of their testimony. Mrs. Logan was several times on the  point of falling into a swoon, so much did the appearance of the young  man impress her, until her associate covered her face that she might  listen without embarrassment. But this latter dialogue roused different  feelings within them; namely, those arising from imminent personal  danger. They saw his waggish associate point out the place of their  concealment to Wringhim, who came towards them, out of curiosity to see  what his friend meant by what he believed to be a joke, manifestly  without crediting it in the least degree. When he came running away,  the other called after him: \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#16)"],[1,"oss; but  water-power is not available everywhere.    CONVERTING HEAT DIRECTLY INTO ELECTRICITY.--Heat may be converted  directly into electricity without using a boiler, an engine or a dynamo,  but it has not been successful from a commercial standpoint. It is  interesting, however, to know and understand the subject, and for that  reason it is explained herein.    METALS; ELECTRIC POSITIVE-NEGATIVE.--To understand the principle, it may  be stated that all metals are electrically positive-negative to each  other. You will remember that it has hereinbefore been stated that if,  for instance, iron and copper are put into an acid solution, a current  will be created or generated thereby. So with zinc and copper, the usual  primary battery elements. In all such cases an electrolyte is used.    Thermo-electricity dispenses with the electrolyte, and nothing is used  but the metallic elements and heat. The word thermo means heat. If, now,  we can select two strips of different metals, and place them as far  apart as possible--that is, in their positive-negative relations with  each other, and unite the end of one with one end of other by means of a  rivet, and then heat the riveted ends, a current will be generated in  the strips. If, for instance, we use an iron in conjunction with a  copper strip, the current will flow from the copper to the iron, because  copper is positive to iron, and iron negative to copper. It is from this  that the term positive-negative is taken.    The two metals most available, which are thus farthest apart in the  scale of positive-negative relation, are bismuth and antimony.    [Illustration: _Fig. 101._ THERMO-ELECTRIC COUPLE]    In Fig. 101 is shown a thermo-electric couple (A, B) riveted together,  with thin outer ends connected by means of a wire (C) to form a circuit.  A galvanometer (D) or other current-testing means is placed in this  circuit. A lamp is placed below the joined ends.    THERMO-ELECTRIC COUPLES.--Any number of these couples may be put  together and joined at each end to a common wire and a fairly large flow  of current obtained thereby.    One thing must be observed: A current will be generated only so long as  there exists a difference in temperature between the inner and the outer  ends of the bars (A, B). This may be accomplished by water, or any other  cooling means which may suggest itself.          CHAPTER XV    ALTERNATING CURRENTS, CHOKING COILS, TRANSFORMERS, CONVERTERS AND  RECTIFIERS      DIRECT CURRENT.--When a current of electricity is generated by a cell,  it is assumed to move along the wire in one direction, in a steady,  continuous flow, and is called a _direct_ current. This direct current  is a natural one if generated by a cell.    ALTERNATING CURRENT.--On the other hand, the natural current generated  by a dynamo is alternating in its character--that is, it is not a  direct, steady flow in one direction, but, instead, it flows for an  instant in one direction, then in the other direction, and so on.    A direct-current dynamo such as we have shown in Chapter IV, is much  easier to explain, hence it is illustrated to show the third method used  in generating an electric current.    It is a difficult matter to explain the principle and operation of  alternating current machines, without becoming, in a measure, too  technical for the purposes of this book, but it is important to know the  fundamentals involved, so that the operation and uses of certain  apparatus, like the choking coil, transformers, rectifiers and  converters, may be explained.    THE MAGNETIC FIELD.--It has been stated that when a wire passes through  the magnetic field of a magnet, so as to cut the lines of force flowing  out from the end of a magnet, the wire will receive a charge of  electricity.    [Illustration: _Fig. 102._ CUTTING A MAGNETIC FIELD]    To explain this, study Fig. 102, in which is a bar magnet (A). If we  take a metal wire (B) and bend it in the form of a loop, as shown, and  mount the ends on journal-bearing blocks, the wire may be rotated so  that the loop will pass through the magnetic field. When this takes  place, the wire receives a charge of electricity, which moves, say, in  the direction of the darts, and will make a complete circuit if the ends  of the looped wire are joined, as shown by the conductor (D).    ACTION OF THE MAGNETIZED WIRE.--You will remember, also that we have  pointed out how, when a current passes over a wire, it has a magnetic  field extending out around it at all points, so that while it is passing  through the magnetic field of the magnet (A), it becomes, in a measure,  a magnet of its own and tries to set up in business for itself as a  generator of electricity. But when the loop leaves the magnetic field,  the magnetic or electrical impulse in the wire also leaves it.    THE MOVEMENT OF A CURRENT IN A CHARGED WIRE.--Your attention is  directed, also, to another statement, heretofore made, namely, that when  a current from a charged wire passes by induction to a wire across  space, so as to charge it with an electric current, it moves along the  charged wire in a direction opposite to that of the current in the  charging wire.    Now, the darts show the direction in which the current moves while it is  approaching and passing through the magnetic field. But the moment the  loop is about to pass out of the magnetic field, the current in the loop  surges back in the opposite direction, and when the loop has made a  revolution and is again entering the magnetic field, it must again  change the direction of flow in the current, and thus produce  alternations in the flow thereof.    Let us illustrate this by showing the four positions of the revolving  loop. In Fig. 103 the loop (B) is in the middle of the magnetic field,  moving upwardly in the direction of the curved dart (A), and while in  that position the voltage, or the electrical impulse, is the most  intense. The current used flows in the direction of the darts (C) or to  the left.    In Fig. 104, the loop (A) has gone beyond the influence of the magnetic  field, and now the current in the loop tries to return, or reverse  itself, as shown by the dart (D). It is a reaction that causes the  current to die out, so that when the loop has reached the point farthest  from the magnet, as shown in Fig. 105, there is no current in the loop,  or, if there is any, it moves faintly in the direction of the dart (E).    [Illustration: _Figs. 103-106._ ILLUSTRATING ALTERNATIONS]    CURRENT REVERSING ITSELF.--When the loop reaches its lowest point (Fig.  106) it again comes within the magnetic field and the current commences  to flow back to its original direction, as shown by darts (C).    SELF-INDUCTION.--This tendency of a current to reverse itself, under the  conditions cited, is called self-induction, or inductance, and it would  be well to keep this in mind in pursuing the study of alternating  currents.    You will see from the foregoing, that the alternations, or the change of  direction of the current, depends upon the speed of rotation of the loop  past the end of the magnet.    [Illustration: _Figs. 107-108._ FORM FOR INCREASING ALTERNATIONS]    Instead, therefore, of using a single loop, we may make four loops (Fig.  107), which at the same speed as we had in the case of the single loop,  will give four alternations, instead of one, and still further, to  increase the periods of alternation, we may use the four loops and two  magnets, as in Fig. 108. By having a sufficient number of loops and of  magnets, there may be 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 or 120 such alternating  periods in each second. Time, therefore, is an element in the operation  of alternating currents.    Let us now illustrate the manner of connecting up and building the  dynamo, so as to derive the current from it. In Fig. 109, the loop (A)  shows, for convenience, a pair of bearings (B). A contact finger (C)  rests on each, and to these the circuit wire (D) is attached. Do not  confuse these contact fingers with the commutator brushes, shown in the  direct-current motor, as they are there merely for the purpose of making  contact between the revolving loop (A) and stationary wire (D).    [Illustration: _Fig. 109._ CONNECTION OF ALTERNATING DYNAMO ARMATURE]    BRUSHES IN A DIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO.--The object of the brushes in the  direct-current dynamo, in connection with a commutator, is to convert  this _inductance_ of the wire, or this effort to reverse itself into a  current which will go in one direction all the time, and not in both  directions alternately.    To explain this more fully attention is directed to Figs. 110 and 111.  Let A represent the armature, with a pair of grooves (B) for the wires.  The commutator is made of a split tube, the parts so divided being  insulated from each other, and in Fig. 110, the upper one, we shall call  and designate the positive (+) and the lower one the negative (-). The  armature wire (C) has one end attached to the positive commutator  terminal and the other end of this wire is attached to the negative  terminal.    [Illustration: _Fig. 110._ DIRECT CURRENT DYNAMO]    One brush (D) contacts with the positive terminal of the commutator and  the other brush (E) with the negative terminal. Let us assume that the  current impulse imparted to the wire (C) is in the direction of the dart  (F, Fig. 110). The current will then flow through the positive (+)  terminal of the commutator to the brush (D), and from the brush (D)  through the wire (G) to the brush (E), which contacts with the negative  (-) terminal of the commutator. This will continue to be the case, while  the wire (C) is passing the magnetic field, and while the brush (D) is  in contact with the positive (+) terminal. But when the armature makes a  half turn, or when it reaches that point where the brush (D) contacts  with the negative (-) terminal, and the brush (E) contacts with the  positive (+) terminal, a"]]]
