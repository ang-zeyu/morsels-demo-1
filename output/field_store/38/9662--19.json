Michelet, the well-known professor of history in the College de  France, has incurred a vote of censure from his associates on account of  his lectures to the students, which, we infer from notices of them, are  quite too republican and socialistic to be approved by the directors of  affairs.           *       *       *       *       *    A new work, by M. Theophile Lavallee, entitled _L'Histoire de Paris et  ses Monumens_ from ancient times to 1850, has just been published at  Paris, with illustrations by M. Champin. It is warmly commended by the  _Debats_.           *       *       *       *       *    MULLIE, of the University of France, has published in two large octavos,  a Biographical Dictionary of the Military Celebrities of France, from  1789 to 1850.           *       *       *       *       *    A second edition of the new _Life of the great Chancellor D'Auguesseau_,  by M. BOUILLE, has been published in Paris. The book continues to be  praised.           *       *       *       *       *    A Romance and Tales, said to have been written by NAPOLEON BONAPARTE,  when he was a youth, are announced for publication in the Paris  _Siecle_. Though the _Siecle_ is a very respectable journal, and it  engages that these compositions are perfectly authentic, and shall be  accompanied by proofs of their genuineness, we do not believe a word of  the pretence of their authorship. It is a fact, however, not unworthy of  note, in a psychological point of view, that the earliest development of  Napoleon's ambition and powers, before a fit field of action had been  opened to them, was in a literary form. At the age of fifteen, when at  the royal school at Paris, he voluntarily prepared a memoir upon the  luxury and expense attending education at that place, in which he urged  the propriety of the students adopting hardy habits and a simple fare,  and themselves to such toils and exposure as they would encounter in  war. In 1787, at the age of eighteen, at Valence, he gained,  anonymously, a prize proposed to the Academy of Lyons by the Abbe  Raynal, on the question, \"What are the principles and institutions best  adapted to advance mankind in happiness?\" In this essay he defined  happiness as consisting in the \"perfect enjoyment of life according to  the laws of our physical and moral organization:\" and the forcible  views, well adapted to the temper of the times, and the vivid style of  writing, attracted much attention. When he was emperor, he was one day  conversing with Talleyrand about this essay, and the latter, a few days  after, took occasion to present it to him, having procured it from the  archives of the academy at Lyons. The emperor took it, and after reading  a few pages, threw it into the fire, saying, \"One can never observe  every thing.\" Talleyrand had not taken the precaution to transcribe it;  but it has been said that Louis Bonaparte had had it copied, and that it  is now in print. About the same time he began a history of Corsica,  which he dedicated to the Abbe Raynal, by whom he had been noticed and  caressed. He corresponded with Paoli in relation to it, and was in  treaty with M. Joly, a bookseller of Dole, for its publication. Raynal,  who read the manuscript, advised its completion; but some change of  purpose prevented its being finished, and it is now lost. During his  residence at Auxonne, in 1790, Napoleon wrote and printed a letter to  Buttafoco, the Corsican deputy for the nobles in the National Assembly.  It is a brilliant and powerful piece of argument and invective, strongly  on the revolutionary side. It produced a marked impression, and was  adopted and reprinted by the patriotic society at Ajaccio. While at  Marseilles, in 1793, Napoleon wrote and published a political dialogue,  called \"The Supper of Beaucaire\"--a judicious, sensible, and able essay,  intended to allay the agitation then existing in that city. A copy of it  was brought to him in later days, but seeing no advantage in reviving,  under the circumstances of a different time, a production written for a  temporary and local excitement, he ordered its suppression.           *       *       *       *       *    The Life of Calvin, by Paul Henry, has been translated from the German  by the Rev. Dr. Henry Stebbing, of London, and we have the first of the  two octavos of which it consists, from the press of Robert Carter &  Brothers. So much inexcusable ignorance, so much perverse  misrepresentation, so much insolent lying, may be found scattered  through modern literature, respecting the great Genevan, that Dr. Henry  deserves well the thanks of the christian world for exhibiting the chief  facts of his history, so plainly that every partisan knave who would  repeat the old slanders, shall be silent hereafter for very shame. John  Calvin was unquestionably subject to the infirmities of our human  nature; so was John Milton; but the inherent and indefectable greatness  of these two men was such, that they dwell apart like stars, in glory  scarcely approachable by mortal virtue or intelligence. John Calvin and  John Milton were in an extraordinary degree the authors of modern  institutions of liberty, and it would be difficult to decide which has  most merit of this praise. The late Albert Gallatin was wont to say that  when we celebrated our condition on the fourth of July, we should first  drink to the memory of John Calvin, and then to the immediate authors of  the Declaration of Independence. Mr. Gallatin did not hold to all the  dogmas of Calvin, but he could not speak of the creatures--like Dyer,  for example--who employ their pennyworth of wit to prejudice the vulgar  against him, without some signs of scorn. We can never forget his  merciless characterization of a malicious feeble-mind, who in a book  entitled _A Monograph of Moral Sense_, declared that Calvin never had  enough humanity in his nature to select even one verse by the  _Evangelists_ for pulpit illustration,--though the Reformer really  preached some folio volumes of commentaries upon the Gospels, preached  from them as much as he did from any other portion of the Bible. This  person--his name was Smith--was not more reckless of truth than it has  been the fashion for anti-Calvinists to be, when writing of that great  man and his doctrines, which they seem to have thought could be put down  by petty libels.    Calvin is now being born into a new life, as it were; the critics and  printers of each particular language are as busy with him as the English  have been with Shakspeare. His amazing wit, and genius, and learning,  are found as attractive and powerful now as they were three hundred  years ago. And this life of him by Henry, embodying whatever of  contemporary records is most needful for the illustration of his  writings, will be likely to have a large sale with every class of  historical students, as they discover that the popular and partisan  notions of him are untrue. Certainly no one should attempt to form an  opinion of Calvin without thoroughly acquainting himself with Henry.           *       *       *       *       *    In Paris, M. MILLER, librarian to the Assembly, has made an important  discovery among some old Greek MSS. of a lost work by Origen. The  _Journal des Debats_ describes the original work as being in ten books;  the first of which is already known to the world under the title of  _Philosophumena_. The last seven books have just been printed at the  university press in Oxford, under the editorial direction of M. Miller,  who went to England for that purpose. They make an octavo volume of  about three hundred and fifty pages. The _Debats_ says the work is \"a  refutation of heresies, in which the author endeavors to prove that the  heresiarchs have all taken their doctrines from the ancient  philosophers:\"--a very curious task for Origen to perform, since he was  himself chiefly remarkable for the mixture of Zeno, Plato, and  Aristotle, which he compounded with his Christianity. But apart from its  controversial interest, the recovered manuscript will throw new light on  the opinions and practices of the Neo-Platonists, and on the manners and  customs of ancient times. Discoveries like this point out the necessity  for a larger and more combined action of learned societies in the search  for ancient manuscripts. Origen's _Stromata_ might even yet be  completed: and it is not to be supposed that all the existing fragments  of his _Hexapla_ were collected by Montfaucon.           *       *       *       *       *    From Constantinople we learn that very important discoveries of ancient  Greek MSS. have been made, in a cave, near the foot of Mount Athos,  bringing to light a vast quantity of celebrated works quoted by various  ancient writers, and hitherto deemed entirely lost. They furnish,  according to the accounts in the journals, an extensive list of proper  names calculated to throw great light upon many obscure periods of  history. Among these volumes, it is said, some are calculated to give a  complete interpretation of hieroglyphic writing--the discoverer having  already successfully applied them to the interpretation of the  inscriptions engraved on the obelisk of the Hippodrome at  Constantinople. This may be quite true, but such statements are to be  received with some suspicion.           *       *       *       *       *    A literal prose translation of Homer, by Mr. T. A. Buckley, has just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"is what the military call, in  the language of chess players, \"to castle\" the army corps. But this  movement could not be accomplished in a few hours. It required, even  with all the perfection of organization shown by the French railways  during this war, a certain number of days. As long as this operation  from the right to the left had not been accomplished, as long as the  left wing of the French army and even the center remained without the  reenforcement of elements taken from the right, it would have been  extremely imprudent, not to say rash, for the French high command to  attempt a decisive battle. If General Joffre had risked a battle  immediately he would have been playing the game without all his trumps  in hand and would have been in danger of a defeat, and even of a decided  disaster, from which it might have been impossible to recover.    The second alternative consisted in drawing back and in profiting from a  retreat by putting everything in shipshape order to bring about a new  grouping of forces. They would allow the Germans to advance, and when  the occasion showed itself favorable the French armies, along with the  British army, would take the offensive and wage a decisive battle.    It was to this second decision that General Joffre came. As soon as on  August 25, 1914, he had made up his mind as to what the French retreat  was going to lead he gave orders for a new marshaling of forces and for  preparations with a view to the offensive.    General Joffre has made no objection to the publication of his orders in  detail from that date, August 25, 1914, down to the Battle of the Marne.  They constitute an eloquent and convincing document. The series of  orders were contained in the \"Bulletin des Armees de la Republique  Francaise,\" June 6, 1915, Sunday. The first of these orders, dated  August 25, 1914, runs as follows:    \"The projected offensive movement not having been found possible of  execution, the consequent operations will be so conducted as to put in  line, on our left, by the junction of the Fourth and Fifth Armies, the  British army, and new forces recruited from the eastern district, a body  capable of taking the offensive while other armies for the needed  interval hold in check the efforts of the enemy....\"    The retreating movement was regulated so as to bring about the following  disposition of forces preparatory to an offensive:    \"In the Amiens district a new grouping of forces, formed of elements  conveyed by rail (Seventh Corps, four divisions of reserve, and perhaps  another active army corps), brought together from August 27 to September  2, 1914. This body will remain ready to take the offensive in the  general direction of St, Pol-Arras or Arras-Bapaume.\"    The same general instructions of August 25, 1914, marks out the zones of  march, and says:    \"The movement will be covered by the rear guards spread out at favorable  points of vantage so as to utilize every obstacle for the purpose of  checking, by brief and violent counterattacks in which the artillery  will play the chief part, the march of the enemy or at least to retard  it.\"                                                      (Signed)  J. JOFFRE.    [Illustration: General Joffre.]    The object of this maneuver is thus already on August 25, 1914, clearly  indicated; it looked not to a defensive, but to an offensive movement,  which was to be resumed as soon as circumstances appeared favorable.  Much is made clear in these orders of General Joffre, which are  characterized by perspicuity, foresight, and precision.    The retreat was effected; but it was only a provisional retreat.  Whenever an occasion presented itself to counterattack the enemy for the  purpose of delaying his advance, that occasion was to be taken advantage  of. And that is, in fact, what took place.    Two days later, on August 27, 1914, General Joffre brought together,  using army corps and divisions recruited elsewhere, a supplementary  army, the Ninth Army, which was detailed to take its place between the  Fourth and Fifth Armies. He intrusted its command to a general, who,  while commanding the Twentieth Corps, had distinguished himself by his  brilliant conduct in Lorraine, General Foch.    The establishment of the army of Manoury on the left of the French  armies so as to fall on the right flank of the Germans when they marched  on Paris; the establishment of a strong army under one of the best  French generals at the center for the purpose of encountering the main  weight of the German army; such were the two decisions of the French  commander in chief, taken on August 25 and 27, 1914, which contained in  germ the victory of the Marne, waged and won two weeks later.          CHAPTER XI    FIGHTING AT BAY      The forces of France also had been fighting to protect their retreat  southward in these August days of 1914. After the passages of the Sambre  were forced, during the great Mons-Charleroi battle, the Fifth French  Army was placed in very perilous straits by the failure of the Fourth  Army, under General Langle, to hold the Belgian river town of Givet.  Hard pressed in the rear by General von Buelow's army, and on their  right by General von Hausen commanding the Saxon Army and the Prussian  Guard, the Fifth Army of France had to retire with all possible speed,  for their path of retreat was threatened by a large body of Teutons  advancing on Rocroi.    On August 23, 1914, holding their indomitable pursuers in check by  desperate rear-guard action, with their two cavalry divisions under  General Sordet galloping furiously along the lines of the western flank  to protect the retiring infantry and guns, the Fifth Army unexpectedly  turned at Guise. At that point considerable reenforcements in troops and  material arrived, making the Fifth Army the strongest in France. It now  defeated and drove over the Oise the German Guard and Tenth Corps, and  then continued its retirement. But the left wing of the French army was  unsuccessful, and Amiens and the passages of the Somme had to be  abandoned to the invaders.    On Sunday, August 23, 1914, the Fourth Army, operating from the Meuse,  was heavily outnumbered by the Saxon army around the river town of  Dinant. They fell back, after furious fighting for the possession of the  bridges, which the French engineers blew up as the army withdrew  southward to the frontier. Soon after, at Givet, the Germans succeeded  in wedging their way across the Meuse. Some advanced on Rocroi and  Rethel, and other corps marched along the left bank of the Meuse,  through wooded country, against a steadily increasing resistance which  culminated at Charleville, a town on the western bank of the river.  There a determined stand was made.    On August 24, 1914, the town of Charleville was evacuated, the civilians  were sent away to join multitudes of other homeless refugees, and then  the French also retired, leaving behind them several machine guns hidden  in houses, placed so that they commanded the town and the three bridges  that connected it with Mezieres.    The German advance guards reached the two towns next day, August 25,  1914, which, as we know, witnessed the British retirement toward Le  Cateau. Unmolested, they rode across the three bridges into the quiet,  empty streets. Suddenly, when all had crossed, the bridges were blown  up behind them by contact mines, and the German cavalrymen were raked by  the deadly fire of the machine guns. Nevertheless, finding their foes  were not numerous, they made a courageous stand, waiting for their main  columns to draw nearer. Every French machine gunner was silenced by the  Guards with their Maxims; but when the main invading army swept into  view along the river valley, the French artillery from the hills around  Charleville mowed down the heads of columns with shrapnel. Still the  Teutons advanced with reckless courage. While their artillery was  engaged in a duel with the French, German sappers threw pontoon bridges  across the river, and finally the French had to retire. Between  Charleville and Rethel there was another battle, resulting in the  abandonment of Mezieres by the French.    The retreating army crossed the Semois, a tributary of the Meuse, which  it enters below Mezieres, and advanced toward Neufchateau; but they were  repulsed by the Germans under the Duke of Wuerttemberg. At Nancy on  August 25, 1914, there was another engagement between the garrison of  Toul and the army of the Crown Prince of Bavaria; after fierce  onslaughts the garrison was compelled to yield and retire. Finally, on  August 27, 1914, at Longwy, a fortified town near Verdun, the army of  the German crown prince succeeded in bursting into France after a long  siege, and marched toward the Argonne. Thus from the western coast  almost to Verdun there was a general Franco-British retreat.    On August 28, 1914, pressed by the German armies commanded by Von Kluck  on the west, by Von Hausen from Dinant and Givet, by Von Buelow from  Charleroi and Namur, the Allies were pushed back upon a line stretching  roughly from Amiens through Noyon-Le Fere to Mezieres; while their  forces east of the Meuse between Mezieres and Verdun were retreating  before Duke Albrecht of Wuerttemberg, and to the southeast of Verdun  before the Bavarians. All northern France was thus open to the invaders.    After the battle of Le Cateau, however, the Germans slackened their  pursuit for a very brief interval; partly because the terrific strain  of marching and fighting was telling upon them no less than upon the  Allies, partly because the engineers had blown up the bridges over every  river, canal, and stream, behind the retreating armies, and partly  because, under directions from the French commander in chief, General  Manoury was organizing a new force on the British left, a new Sixth  Army, mainly reserve troops, one corps of line troops, and General  Sordet's cavalry.
