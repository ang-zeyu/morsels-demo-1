Pure tannin,         1 oz.    Red pepper,         1 oz.    Camphor,             1 oz.    Burnt alum,         8 oz.    Pound and thoroughly mix, and keep in stoppered bottles or canisters.    The foregoing preparation, though perfectly efficient for small  mammals (say up to squirrel size) and for birds, is not sufficiently  strong to penetrate the skin and thoroughly fix the hair of the larger  mammals. For this purpose the older taxidermists used a wash or  powder, composed of equal parts of alum and nitre (saltpetre). This  had the double disadvantage of rendering the specimen cured by its aid  almost dripping with humidity in damp weather, and efflorescing with  the double salts around the eyes and mouth in dry weather. Alum alone  was frequently used by those unaware of its peculiar property of  deliquescing in heat as well as in humidity.    I have, I believe, at last succeeded in arranging the proper  proportions, and in substituting, for the worse than useless crude  alum, the alum ustum or burnt alum, which is not affected by moisture  (at least to any appreciable extent). The proportions are:    No. 9.--Browne's Preservative Powder for Skins of Mammals.    Burnt alum,             1 lb.    Saltpetre,                 0.25 lb.    Pound and thoroughly mix.    This, well rubbed into the skin and fleshy parts of mammals, is a  certain and thoroughly trustworthy cure, and will penetrate through  skin a quarter of an inch or more thick, fixing the hair or fur in a  most admirable manner, and has the double advantage of being harmless  to the person using it, and beneficial even if it gets on the outside  of the skin of the specimen; indeed, it should be rubbed in on the fur  side if the specimen is at all \"high\" when brought in. In all cases it  is a good plan to thoroughly rub the outside of the ears, eyelids,  nose, and lips, with this composition before skinning. I consider this  the greatest boon to the animal preserver ever invented, and those to  whom I have imparted the formula are loud in its praise, as witness  the dozens of letters I have received from all parts during the last  seven years.    If the proportions given are adhered to, no crystallisation of salts  will take place around the eyes and mouth. Should this, however,  happen from any cause, a stiff brush dipped in olive oil may be used  to remove it and prevent its reappearance.    After the mammal is stuffed and mounted, it may be washed over with  Waterton's Solution (previously given) or the following, which ought  to preserve the specimen from the attacks of insects:    No. 10.--Preservative Wash.    Corrosive sublimate,             1 oz.    Tincture of camphor (or musk),     1 oz.    Methylated spirits, 1 quart.         1 oz.    This solution must be kept in a bottle, carefully labelled \"Poison,\"  and when used is not to be touched with the hands, but laid on with a  brush.    It constantly happens that parts of the bodies of animals--notably  their fore and hind limbs, and their heads even--are required to be  preserved for some considerable time for purposes of modelling their  contour or muscles; it then becomes necessary to find some preparation  which will keep large pieces of flesh sufficiently sweet and firm to  model from. For the first edition, I had written to a scientific  friend as to the preparations now in use at the various hospitals for  the preservation of subjects, etc, to which he answered:    \"As far as I can glean from various sources, the medical profession  has only within the last few years attempted to preserve whole bodies.  Parts have, of course, been preserved in alcohol of some kind until  they have literally crumbled away. At St. George's Hospital they use a  preservative fluid, invented by the hospital porter (dissecting-room  porter). The subjects are kept in a slate tank filled with the fluid.  To show the efficiency of this fluid, I might mention that the first  subject arrived much decomposed some months since, but is now quite  fresh and sweet. The muscles inevitably lose a little of their colour  in the preparation, which is all the change as yet observed. At Guy's  is used a preparation of glycerine and arsenic, but at the present  moment I do not recollect the exact proportions. At King's College,  the method invented by Sterling, of Edinburgh, is used. All other  hospitals have the old methods in vogue, such as preparations of  arsenic.\"    Since then, I have had occasion to go more deeply into the subject and  have used some of the formulae which follow, viz, rectified spirits,  Moeller's Solution, and various preparations of lime.    Messrs. Medlock and Bailey's bisulphite of lime (calcium) is most  highly recommended by analytical experts for preserving large joints  of meat and fish; and, indeed, the experiments conducted under  scientific and Government supervision have abundantly proved its  value. Its price is not great. For large joints the following is the  formula:    No. 11.--Messrs. Medlock and Bailey's Formula.    Bisulphite of lime,     1 gall.    Common salt,         0.25 pint.    Water,             2 to 4 galls.    The following, taken from the \"Year Book of Pharmacy for 1880,\"  appears to be a very efficient formula; like all the rest of such  formulae, it contains a certain percentage of arsenious acid:    A new Preserving Fluid.--The Prussian Secretary of State for Education  has caused the publication of the following compound and method of its  application, discovered by Wickersheimer, the Preparator of the  Anatomical Museum of the University of Berlin, who had at first  patented the compound, but was induced to renounce his patent claims.    No. 12.--Wickersheimer's Preserving Liquid, No. 1.    In 3000 parts of boiling water dissolve 100 of alum, 25 of sodium  chloride, 12 of potassium nitrate, 60 of potassa, and 10 of arsenious  acid, let cool and filter. To every 10 litres of the filtrate add 4  litres of glycerine and 1 litre of methylic alcohol. [Footnote: A gram  = 15.444 grains troy; a litre = a little more than 11 pints.]    Its application differs with the special objects to be preserved. In  general, the objects must be impregnated with it. If the objects are  to be preserved dry, they are soaked in the liquid from six to twelve  days, and afterwards dried in the air.    Ligaments, muscles, and other animal objects remain perfectly soft and  movable. Hollow organs, as lungs and intestines, should be filled with  the liquid previous to immersion in it; after being taken out, and  before drying, it is advisable to inflate them with air. Injecting the  liquid into a corpse will preserve the latter completely, and the  muscular tissue will always retain the natural colour of fresh  corpses. To preserve the outward appearance of the latter, they should  be well impregnated externally and enclosed in air-tight oases; this  is only necessary to preserve the exact original appearance; if it  is not done, the body will keep equally well if thoroughly injected,  but the exterior will gradually become somewhat dry and dark coloured.  Plants may likewise be preserved by this liquid. [Footnote: So  expensive a preparation is, I think, sufficiently well replaced by  salt, corrosive sublimate, and distilled water (see Formula No. 27).  M. Decandolle exhibited, some years since, a branch of a coffee tree  which had been perfectly preserved for fifty years. It was then  pointed out that the efficacy of such solutions (saline) depended on  their being boiled and applied to the plants hot (not boiling).]    The following is a modification of the above, useful for comparison as  to relative strengths for injection and immersion:    No. 13.--Wickersheimer's Preserving Liquids, Nos. 2 and 3.                              For Injecting.         For Immersing.    Arsenious acid             16 grams               12 grams.    Sodium chloride            80 grams               60 grams.    Potassium sulphate        200 grams              150 grams.    Potassium nitrate          25 grams               18 grams.    Potassium carbonate        20 grams               15 grams.    Water                      10 litres              10 litres.    Glycerine                   4 litres               4 litres.    Wood naphtha                0.75 litres            0.75 litres.    My friend, Dr. Priestley Smith, surgeon to the Birmingham Eye  Hospital, has kindly given me his formula for a process which most  admirably preserves delicate parts of animals. Having been enabled to  give him some eyes of rare animals and fishes (whales and sharks), he  showed me the process which is now fully explained in the following  extract from the British Medical Journal of Jan. 10th, 1880:    PRESERVATION OF OPHTHALMIC SPECIMENS.    Several friends and correspondents have asked me to refer them to a  description of the method which I employ for the preservation of  ophthalmic specimens, examples of which were exhibited in the annual  museum of the Association in Cork last summer. I published an account  of it in the Birmingham Medical Review for July, 1878; but, as several  improvements have been effected since that time, I shall be greatly  obliged by being allowed space in this journal for a brief description  of my present method.    No. 14.--Priestley Smith's Formula.    The following are the solutions, etc, employed:    1. Mueller's Fluid--viz.       Bichromate of potash 1 part,       Sulphate of soda 1 part,       Water 100 parts;    2. Hydrate of chloral and water, 1 in 20;    3. Glycerine and water, 1 in 4,    4.

[Illustration: Coupe de Pyrenees]    Toulouse has many historic sights and monuments, and a _cuisine_  which is well worth a trip across France. What with truffles and the  famous _cassoulet_ and the _chapons fins de Toulouse_ one forgets to  speak of anything else on the menu, though the rest will be  sufficiently marvellous.    There are three \"leading\" hotels in Toulouse catering for the  automobile tourist. According to report they are all equally good. We  chose the Capoul, on the Square Lafayette, and had no cause to regret  it. We dined sumptuously, slept in a great ducal sort of an apartment  with a _hygienique_ bedstead (a thing of brass openwork and iron  springs) tucked away in one corner, full fifteen paces from the door  by which one entered--\"_Un bon kilometre encore,_\" said the _garcon  de chambre_, facetiously, as he showed us up. It promised airiness,  at any rate, and if we were awakened at four in the morning by the  extraordinarily early traffic of the city what did it matter, since  automobiles invariably take early to the road.    It's worth stating here that the _cafe au lait_ at six A. M. at the  Hotel Capoul was excellent. Frequently hotel coffee in the morning in  France (at no matter what hour) is abominable. Usually it is warmed  over from the night before. No wonder it is bad!    Toulouse delayed us not on this occasion. We had known it of old; so  we started a little before seven on a brilliant September morning,  just as the sun was rising over the cathedral towers and  strengthening the shadows on the tree-lined boulevard which leads  eastward via Castlemaudry to the walled city of Carcassonne,  ninety-six kilometres away. The road-books say of this route;    \"_Pl. Roul. puis Ond Tr. Pitt._\" This freely translated means that  the road is at first flat, then rolling and hilly, but very  picturesque throughout. Castlemaudry delayed us not a moment, except  to extricate ourselves from a troop of unbridled, unhaltered little  donkeys being driven to the market-place, where there was a great  sale of these gentle little beasts of burden. _Pas mechant_, these  little donkeys, but stubborn, like their brethren elsewhere, and it  was exceedingly difficult to force our way through two hundred of  them, all of whom wiggled their ears at us and stood their ground  until their guardians actually came and pushed them to one side. \"You  can often push a donkey when you can't pull him,\" they told us, a  fact which was most apparent, though unknown to us previously. We  arrived at Carcassonne in time for lunch, which we had always  supposed was called _dejeuner_ in France, but which we learned was  here called _diner_, the evening meal (at the fashionable hour of  eight) being known as _souper_, though in reality it is a five-course  dinner.    Carcassonne was a disappointment. Imagine a puffed-up little  metropolis of twenty-five thousand souls with all the dignity that  half a dozen pretentious hotels and gaudy cafes can give it; not very  clean, nor very well laid out, nor very ancient-looking, nor very  picturesque. Where was the Carcassonne of the frowning ramparts, of  the gem of a Gothic church, and of the romance and history of which  all school-books are filled?    \"Oh! You mean _la Cite,_\" said the buxom hostess of our hotel. (They  are always buxom hostesses in books, but this was one in reality.)  Well, yes, we did mean _la Cite_, if by that name the referred to the  old walled town of Carcasonne, _la ville la plus curieuse de France,  un monument unique au mond._    It is but a short kilometre to reach _la Cite_ from the _Ville  Basse_, as the modern city of Carcassonne is known. Once within the  double row of walls, flanked by more than fifty towers, any  preconceived ideas that one may have had of what it might be like  will be dispelled in air. It is the most stupendously theatrical  thing yet on top of earth, unless it be the sad and dismal Pompeii or  poor rent Les Baux, in Provence.    The history of this wonder-work cannot be compressed into a few  lines. One can merely emphasize its marvellous attractions, so that  those who are in the neighbourhood may go and study it all out for  themselves. It will be worth whole volumes on history and  architecture for the earnest student to see these things. Among all  the authorities who have proclaimed the magnificent attractions of  Carcassonne the words of Viollet-le-Duc are as convincing as any. He  says: \"In no part of Europe is there anything so formidable, nor at  the same time so complete, as the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth  century fortifications of Carcassonne.\"    We stayed a full day at Carcassonne, and reached the frowning  battlements of the Eglise St. Nazaire, at Beziers, at just two by the  clock. This is the hour when all the _commis-voyageurs_, who may have  taken lunch at the Hotel du Nord, are dozing over their _cafe_ and  _petites verres_, and the _patron_ and _patronne_ of the hotel are  making preparations for their early afternoon siesta, an attribute of  all the Midi of France, as it is of Spain.    Nothing loath, the kitchen staff, spurred on by the _patron_ (all  thoughts of his siesta having vanished), turned out a most excellent  lunch, _hors d'oeuvres_, fresh sardines, omelette, _cotelette  d'agneau_ with _pommes paille_, delicious grapes, and all you wish of  the red or white _vin du pays_. All for the absurd sum (considering  the trouble they were put to) of three francs each. No \"_doing_\" the  automobilist here; let other travellers make a note of the name!    Beziers is altogether one of the most remarkably disposed large towns  of the south of France. Its storied past is lurid enough to please  the most bloodthirsty, as is recalled by the history of its  fortress-church of St. Nazaire, now the cathedral. For the rest the  reader must hunt it out in his guide-book. We were doing no lightning  tour, but we were of a mind to sleep that night at Perpignan,  approximately a hundred kilometres farther on.    Southward our road turned again, through Narbonne, which, both from  its history and from its present-day importance, stands out as one of  the well-remembered spots in one's itinerary of France. It is full of  local colour; its bridge of houses over its river is the delight of  the artistic; its Hotel de Ville and its cathedral are wonders of  architectural art; and, altogether, as the ancient capital of an  ancient province, one wonders that a seventeenth-century traveller  had the right to call it \"_cette vilaine ville de Narbonne._\"    All the way to Perpignan the roads were terrifically bad, being cut  up into great dusty ruts by many great carts and drays hauling  wine-pipes to the railway stations. The traffic is enormous, for it  is the wines of Roussillon that are shipped all over France for  blending with and fortifying the weaker vintages, even those of the  Gironde.    Dusty in dry weather, and chalky mud in wet, are the characteristic  faults of this hundred kilometres or more of Herault roadway which  one must cross to gain the shadow of the Pyrenees. There seems to be  no help for it unless cobblestones were to be put down, which would  be a cure worse than the disease.    Perpignan is the most entrancing city between Marseilles and  Barcelona. It has many of the characteristics of both, though of only  thirty thousand inhabitants. The old fortifications, which once gave  it an aspect of mediaevalism, are now (by decree of 1903) being torn  down, and only the quaintly picturesque Castillet remains. The rest  are--at the present writing--a mere mass of crumbled bricks and  mortar, and a real blemish to an otherwise exceedingly attractive,  gay little city. The automobile garages are all side by side on a  new-made street, on the site of one line of the old fortifications,  and are suitable enough when found, but no directions which were  given us enabled us to house our machine inside of half an hour's  time after we had entered the town. Our hotel, unfortunately, was one  of the few that did not have a garage as an adjunct of the  establishment. In other respects the Hotel de la Poste was a marvel  of up-to-dateness. The sleeping-rooms were of that distinction known  in France as _hygienique_, and the stairways and walls were  fire-proof, or looked it. One dined in a great first-floor apartment  with a marble floor, and dined well, and there was ice for those who  wanted it. (The Americans did, you may be sure.)    Perpignan is possessed of much history, much character, and much  local colour of the tone which artists love, and above all a certain  gaiety and brilliancy which one usually associates only with Spain.    There is what might be called a street of cafes at Perpignan, not far  from the Castillet. They are great, splendid establishments, with  wide, overhung, awninged terraces, and potted plants and electric  lights and gold and tinsel, and mixed drinks and ices and sorbets,  and all the epicurean cold things which one may find in the best  establishment in Paris. These cafes are side by side and opposite  each other, and are as typical of the life of the town as is the  Rambla typical of Barcelona, or the Cannebiere of Marseilles. They  are dull enough places in the daytime, but with the hour of the  _aperitif_, which may be anywhere between five and eight in the  afternoon, they wake up a bit, then slumber until nine or  nine-thirty, when gaiety descends with all its forces until any hour  you like in the morning. They won't think of such a thing as turning  the lights out on you in the cafes of Perpignan.    From Perpignan we turned boldly into the cleft road through the  valley of the Tet, via Prades and Mont Louis to Bourg-Madame, the  frontier town toward Spain, and the only decent route for entering  Spain by automobile via"]]]
