[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#16)"],[1," age the margin becomes elevated until the plant becomes funnel-shaped.  The margin is frequently incurved and finally wavy. The flesh is soft  and white. The color of the cap is a pale tan. If the cap is examined  carefully it will be seen to be covered with a slight down or silky  substance, especially on the margin. The color of the cap is apt to fade  so that specimens will be found almost white.    The gills are thin, close, white or whitish, and very decurrent.    The stem is quite smooth, and generally tapers upward from the base. It  is sometimes white or whitish, but more frequently like the cap.  Mycelium will usually be found at the base on the leaves, forming a soft  white down. I have found this species in several parts of the state. It  is frequently found in clusters, when the caps will be irregular on  account of the crowded condition. They are very tender and of excellent  flavor. Found from August to October.      _Clitocybe odora. Bull._    SWEET-SMELLING CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 66.--Clitocybe odora. One-third natural size. Cap  pale green.]    Odora means fragrant. This is one of the easiest of the Clitocybes to  identify. The collector will very readily recognize it by its  olive-green color and its odor. The color in the old plant is quite  variable but in young plants is well marked. The pileus is one to two  and a half inches broad, flesh quite thick; at first convex, then  expanded, plane, often depressed, sometimes inclined to be wavy; even,  smooth, olive-green.    The gills are adnate, rather close, sometimes slightly decurrent, broad,  pallid.    The stem is one to one and a half inches long, often slightly bulbous at  the base.    These plants are found from August to October, in the woods, on leaves.  They are quite common about Chillicothe after a rain. When cooked by  themselves the flavor is a bit strong, but when mixed with other plants  not so strong in flavor, they are fine.      _Clitocybe illudens. Schw._    THE DECEIVING CLITOCYBE. NOT EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate X. Figure 67.--Clitocybe illudens.    Caps reddish-yellow to deep yellow. Gills yellow and decurrent.]    Illudens means deceiving. Pileus of a beautiful yellow, very showy and  inviting. Many a basketful has been brought to me to be identified with  the hope of their edibility. The cap is convex, umbonate, spreading,  depressed, smooth, often irregular from its crowded condition of growth;  in older and larger plants the margin of the pileus is wavy. The flesh  is thick at the center but thinner toward the margin. In old plants the  color is brownish.    The gills are decurrent, some much further than others; yellow; not  crowded; broad.    The stem is solid, long, firm, smooth tapering towards the base, as will  be seen by Figure 67, sometimes the stems are very large.    The pileus is from four to six inches broad. The stem is six to eight  inches high. It occurs in large clusters and the rich saffron color of  the entire plant compels our admiration and we are reminded that \"not  all is gold that glitters.\" It will be interesting to gather a large  cluster to show its phosphorescence and the heat which the plant will  generate. You can show the phosphorescence by putting it in a dark room  and by placing a thermometer in the cluster you can show the heat. It is  frequently called \"Jack-o'-lantern.\"    I have known people to eat it without harm, but the chances are that it  will make most persons sick. It ought to be good, since it is so  abundant and looks so rich. Found from July to October.      _Clitocybe multiceps. Pk._    THE MANY-HEADED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 68.--Clitocybe multiceps. One-half natural size.  Caps grayish-white.]    Multiceps means many heads; so called because many caps are found in one  cluster. It is a very common plant around Chillicothe. It has been found  within the city limits. It is quite a typical species, too, having all  the characteristics of the genus. I have often seen over fifty caps in  one cluster.    The pileus is white or gray, brownish-gray or buff; smooth, thin at the  margin, convex, slightly moist in rainy weather.    The gills are white, crowded, narrow at each end, decurrent.    The stem is tough, elastic, fleshy, solid, tinged with the same color as  the cap.    The pileus is one to three inches broad; grows in dense tufts. Spores  are white, smooth and globose.    When found in June the plants are a shade whiter than in the fall. The  fall plants are very much the oyster color. The early plant is a more  tender one and better for table use, however, I do not regard it as  excellent. They are found in woods, in old pastures by logs and stumps,  and in lawns. June to October.      _Clitocybe clavipes. Pers._    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Figure 69.--Clitocybe clavipes.]    Clavipes is from _clava_, a club, and _pes_, a foot.    The pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, fleshy, rather spongy,  convex to expanded, obtuse, even, smooth, gray or brownish, sometimes  whitish toward the margin.    The gills are decurrent, descending, rather distant, nearly entire,  rather broad, white.    The stem is two inches long, swollen at the base, attenuated upward,  stuffed, spongy, fibrillose, livid sooty. Spores are elliptical,  6-7x4u.    I found specimens on Cemetery Hill underneath pine trees. I sent some to  Dr. Herbst and Prof. Atkinson; both pronounced them C. clavipes. They  resemble quite closely C. nebularis. I have also found this plant in  mixed woods. Edible and fairly good.      _Clitocybe tornata. Fr._    Tornata means turned in a lathe; so called because of its neat and  regular form.    The pileus is orbicular, plane, somewhat depressed, thin, smooth,  shining, white, darker on the disk, very regular.    The gills are decurrent adnate, rather crowded, white.    The stem is stuffed, firm, slender, smooth, pubescent at the base.    The spores are elliptical, 4-6x3-4u.    These are small, very regular, and inodorous plants. They are found in  open fields in the grass about elm stumps. July to September. They are  edible and cook readily.      _Clitocybe metachroa. Fr._    THE OBCONIC CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 70.--Clitocybe metachroa. Caps dark gray. Gills  pale gray.]    Metachroa means changing color.    The pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, somewhat fleshy,  convex, then plane, depressed, smooth, hygrophanous, brownish-gray, then  livid, growing pale.    The gills are attached to the stem, crowded, pale gray, slightly  decurrent.    The stem is one to two inches long, stuffed, then hollow, apex mealy,  equal, gray.    It differs from C. ditopa in being inodorous and having a thicker and  depressed pileus.    The caps are quite smooth and are frequently concentrically cracked or  wrinkled, much as in Clitopilus noveboracensis.    It is found growing on leaves in mixed woods, after a rain, in August  and September. When young the margin is incurved but wavy in age. It is  quite a hardy plant.      _Clitocybe adirondackensis. Pk._    [Illustration: Figure 71.--Clitocybe adirondackensis. Three-fourths  natural size. Caps white.]    Adirondackensis, so called because the plant was first found in the  Adirondack Mountains of New York.    The pileus is thin, submembranaceous, funnel-form, with the margin  decurved, nearly smooth, hygrophanous, white, the disk often darker.    The gills are white, very narrow, scarcely broader than the thickness of  the flesh of the pileus, crowded, long, decurrent, subarcuate, some of  them forked.    The stem is slender, subequal, not hollow, whitish, mycelio-thickened at  the base. _Peck._    The pileus is one to two inches broad and the stem is one to two and a  half long. This is quite a pretty mushroom and has the Clitocybe  appearance in a marked degree. The long, narrow, decurrent gills,  sometimes tinged with yellow, some of them forked, margin of the pileus  sometimes wavy, will assist in distinguishing it. I have no doubt of its  edibility. Found among leaves in woods after heavy rains. With us it is  confined to the wooded hillsides. The specimens in Figure 71 were found  in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer. Found in July and August.      _Clitocybe ochropurpurea. Berk._    THE CLAY-PURPLE CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate XI. Figure 72.--Clitocybe ochropurpurea.]    Ochropurpurea is from _ochra_, ocher or clay color; _purpureus_, purple;  it is so called because the caps are clay-color and the gills are  purple. The caps are convex, fleshy, quite compact, clay-colored,  sometimes tinged with purple around the margin, cuticle easily  separating, margin involute, often at first tomentose, old forms often  repand or wavy.    The gills are purple, sometimes whitish in old specimens from the white  spores, broad behind, decurrent, distant.    The stem is paler than the cap, often tinted with purple, solid,  frequently long and swollen in the middle, fibrous. The spores white or  pale yellow.    The first time I found this species I never dreamed that it was a  Clitocybe. It was especially abundant on our wooded clay banks or  hillsides, near Chillicothe, during the wet weather in July and August  of 1905. It is a hardy plant and will keep for days. Insects do not seem  to work in it readily. When cooked carefully it is rather tender and  fairly good.      _Clitocybe subditopoda. Pk._    Subditopoda is so called because it is nearly (sub) like Fries' C.  ditopus, which means living in two places, perhaps referring to the stem  being sometimes central and sometimes eccentric.    The pileus is thin, convex or nearly plane, umbilicate, hygrophanous,  grayish-brown, striate on the margin when moist, paler when dry, flesh  concolorous, odor and taste farinaceous.    The gills are broad, close, adnate, whitish or pale cinereous.    The stem is equal, smooth, hollow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1,"category combined into a new Background statement.
