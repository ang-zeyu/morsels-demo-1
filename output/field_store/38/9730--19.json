Hence the entire stock of fowls on  a farm is renewed in two years. Most farmers intend to kill off all  their two-year-old hens each year, thus keeping up the number in the  flock by growing annually about as many young birds as there are hens in  the flock. To allow for losses, for an excess of males, and for inferior  pullets which are not worth keeping for layers, it is necessary to hatch  about four times as many chickens as are to be reserved.    =The hatching season.= Most of the chickens reared on farms are hatched  in the spring months. The late-hatched chickens are nearly all from hens  that steal their nests. People on farms do not want late chickens; among  so many larger ones a few small birds have very little chance to make  good growth. But those who have a place to keep a few early chickens and  time to take care of them often set a few hens in the winter. Eggs will  hatch at any season of the year, and chickens will grow if they get  proper care; but there is a comparatively short season in the spring  when eggs hatch better and chickens grow better than at any other time,  and the easiest way to get a given number of good chickens that will be  full-grown at the beginning of winter is to hatch them in this natural  hatching season. This season cannot be exactly defined, because it  varies according to latitude and also from year to year according to the  weather. Perhaps the best general rule is to have the first chicks hatch  when the grass is beginning to grow. To effect this the hens must be set  three weeks earlier, when there may be no signs of spring. No one can  time hatches to a natural phenomenon of this kind with certainty, but by  planning with reference to the advance of spring in a normal season, the  first hatches are usually brought very near to the desired time.    =Broody hens.= When a hen wants to incubate eggs, or, as the common  phrase is, to sit, she remains on her nest continuously and, unless very  shy, will not leave it when approached and will resent any interference.  The hen is then said to be broody. Because the broody hen makes a  clucking noise, she is sometimes called a clucking hen. Hens that are  shy when they begin to cluck, and that fly from the nest when  approached, usually become tame and allow themselves to be handled after  a few days. Broody hens cannot always be obtained at the time they are  wanted. In that case there is nothing to do but wait, or try to buy,  hire, or borrow them. There is no way of forcing or inducing hens to  become broody before they would do so of their own accord. When broody  hens are hard to get, people think that hatching with incubators will  relieve them of trouble and prevent delay, but the incubator, too, has  its uncertainties. Success in artificial hatching requires careful  attention to the operation of the incubator and good judgment in  adjusting and regulating it.    [Illustration: Fig. 91. Nest boxes, made in pairs, for sitting hens.  Inside dimensions: large, 16\" x 16\" x 18\"; small, 12\" x 12\" x 15\"]    [Illustration: Fig. 92. Same as Fig. 91, with nest boxes closed]    =Setting the hens.= As many broody hens as can be obtained should be set  at the same time. The most convenient style of nest is that shown in  Figs. 91 and 92, which can be kept closed if desired. The best nest  material is soft hay or straw. In preparing the nest a poultry keeper  shapes the nest material with his hand, to give it a bowl shape,  pressing it down to make a smooth, firm surface upon which the eggs will  lie evenly. It is a good plan to make the nests and place the hens in  them, giving to each a few China nest eggs two or three days before the  eggs that are to be hatched are given to them. The eggs for hatching  should be of good size and shape, with good strong shells, and as  uniform in color as can be obtained. The usual number of eggs placed  under a hen is thirteen. After the weather becomes warm, even a small  hen will cover thirteen eggs well, and medium-sized hens will cover  fifteen or sixteen eggs and often hatch every one, but early in the  season it is better to give a hen eleven eggs or perhaps only nine. The  number of eggs given a hen is almost always an odd number. There is an  old superstition that an even number will not hatch. The reason commonly  given by writers on poultry is that an odd number of eggs arrange in  better form in the nest, but this is mere fancy. However the practice  started, the real reason why odd numbers of eggs are placed in nests of  sitting hens now is that the custom is so well established, and the  habit of thinking of eggs for hatching in odd numbers is so strong, that  most poultry keepers do it unconsciously.    =Care of sitting hens.= The best food for sitting hens is whole corn. As  the hen will leave the nest only once a day, and not always daily unless  removed, the food is given in a vessel from which she can eat it  readily. The usual way is to keep a supply where the hens are, so that  whenever they leave the nest they can get something to eat. Whether to  let them choose their own time to leave the nest or to keep the nests  closed except when they are let off at a regular time each day is a  point to be determined in each case according to the circumstances. If  all the hens in the same place are quiet and get along well together and  do not quarrel for the possession of particular nests, they may be left  very much to themselves; otherwise the poultry keeper should regulate  things so that there will be no quarreling and no danger of a nest of  eggs getting cold while two hens crowd on another nest and break some of  the eggs in it.    Besides grain the hens need water and a place to dust. Most sitting hens  will dust themselves every time they leave the nest, if they have an  opportunity to do so. As lice multiply rapidly on sitting hens, it is a  good idea, even when the hen can dust herself, to apply an insect powder  to her and to the nest two or three times during the period of  incubation.    The eggs may be tested at the end of the seventh day by using a light,  as described on page 21. While fertility can be determined earlier,  waiting until the seventh day enables one to tell more surely whether  fertility is strong or weak, and to discard weak germs as well as  infertile eggs. An infertile egg is clear, that is, shows no signs of  development or decay, at every period of incubation. The eggs that rot  are fertile eggs in which the germs have died. A rotten egg is  distinguished from a fertile egg through the tester by the movement of  the line between the transparent air space at the large end of the egg  and the dark contents, this movement showing that the contents are in a  fluid state. The eggs which are the most opaque and have the air space  most distinctly marked are those which have the strongest germs. Eggs  that are conspicuously light-colored (as they appear before the light)  when compared with these may as well be discarded. If many eggs are  discarded, those that remain may be given to a part of the hens, and the  rest of the hens reset.    =Attention at hatching time.= The eggs of medium-sized fowls usually  hatch in from twenty to twenty-one days. The eggs of small fowls take  about a day less, and those of large fowls about a day more. Hens' eggs  have been known to hatch as early as the seventeenth day and as late as  the twenty-fourth, but as a rule chickens that come before the  nineteenth day or after the twenty-second are weakly. Hens sometimes  trample the chickens in the nests or crush the eggs after they are  picked, so that the chicken cannot turn to break the shell in the  regular manner. Sometimes this is due to the nervousness or to the  clumsiness of the hen, but oftener it is caused by the nest being too  much dished (that is, hollowed so much that the eggs tend to roll toward  the center) or by lice disturbing her. The chickens may be saved either  by removing them to other broody hens or by putting them in a flannel  wrapping in a warm place. Unless, however, the conditions are bad, it is  better to leave them with the hen. Hens with little chicks should be  left in the nests until all the eggs that will hatch have hatched and  the chicks are dry and begin to show an inclination to run about. Then,  if the weather is fine, the hen and her brood may be taken at once to a  coop out of doors, but if it is cold or stormy, the little chicks are  better indoors.    [Illustration: Fig. 93. Coop for hen and chicks, to be used without run]    =Coops for broods.= The coop for a hen and chickens should be so  constructed that they will have plenty of fresh air at night. There  should be a small run attached to it, to which the hen can be confined  while the chickens run about or come to her to be brooded, as they may  wish. It is not a good plan to let a hen run with her brood while the  chicks are very small. The chickens do much better if the mother is  confined and gives more attention to keeping them warm than to feeding  them. The coops should not be placed in the same spot year after year,  nor should they be on land upon which the old fowls run during any  considerable portion of the year. Sod ground is best.    [Illustration: Fig. 94. Coop to be used with runs, as in Fig. 95]    =Feeding young chickens.= From early times in America the most common  food for young chickens has been corn meal moistened with water. When  fresh this is a good food for chickens that run about and eat a great  deal of green food, insects, worms, and small seeds, but a mash of  scalded corn meal and bran, such as is given old fowls, or a baked  johnnycake, is better. There is no need of fussing with such foods as  finely chopped hard-boiled eggs, cracker crumbs, pinhead oatmeal, and  other things often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#16)"],[1,"one, of the Emperor  Conrad, and his son Henry; the design, action, and characters, like the  mosaics at Rome; executed about the year 1030.

Of this number is a Madonna, with a Greek inscription, at  the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin at Rome. There is also one at  Camerino said to have come from Smyrna; and I know of no Greek picture  in Italy better executed or better preserved.]    [Footnote 33: The lateral gate of bronze is of very rude workmanship, as  described by the Canon Martini, in his account of that temple, p. 85;  and by Sig. da Morrona, it is with much probability ascribed to the hand  of Bonanno Pisano. From Vasari's life of Arnalfo, we learn that the same  sculptor also executed the great gate of the Primaziale at Pisa, in  bronze, about the year 1180, subsequently destroyed by fire. That of  Santa Maria Nuova at Monreale, is likewise his. It is described by P.  del Giudice, in his account of that church, and bears the name of  Bonanno Pisano, with the date 1186. It is as rudely executed as the  preceding one at Pisa, as I am assured by the Cavalier Puccini,  accurately versed in every branch of the fine arts. If we wish to  estimate the merit of Niccola Pisano, we have only to compare these two  gates with the specimens which he gave us only a few years afterwards.]    [Footnote 34: Several specimens of similar productions also remain in  Sicily, particularly at Mazzerra and Girganti. At Palermo, the tomb of  the Empress Constance II. who died in the year 1222, is decorated with  an antique sculpture in basso relievo, representing a chase, which is  conjectured to represent that of AEneas and Dido, and which is well  engraved. See the work entitled, \"I Regali Sepolchri del Duomo di  Palermo riconosciuti e illustrati. Nap. 1784.\"    Another specimen of this sort is said to be in the collection of Mr.  Blundell, at Ince.]    [Footnote 35: In the new Guide to Milan, Sig. Abate Bianconi observes,  \"that these are beautiful works, and that nothing superior is to be seen  in any work of that age. Vasari, by omitting this very eminent Pisan,  and not mentioning these works, although he was according to his own  account at Milan, has given reason to believe, that he was not over  anxious in his researches.\" p. 215.    See also Giulini and Verri, as quoted by Sig. da Morrona in tom. i. pp.  199, 200.]    [Footnote 36: The mosaic school subsisted at Rome as early as the  eleventh and twelfth centuries. (See Musant. Fax Chronol. pp. 319, 338.)  In this the family of the Cosmati acquired great excellence. Adeodato di  Cosimo Cosmati employed himself in the church of St. Maria Maggiore, in  1290, (Guide to Rome); and several of the same name exercised their  talents in the cathedral of Orvieto. (See Valle Catalogo.) The whole of  these are preferred to the Greek mosaic workers, who were at the same  period engaged in decorating St. Mark's at Venice. (See Valle's Preface  to Vasari, p. 61.)]    [Footnote 37:      _Sancti Francisci Frater fuit hoc operatus    Jacobus in tali prae cunctis arte probatus_,    is the inscription on the mosaic.]    [Footnote 38: See _Pisa Illustrata_ of Signor da Morrona, tom. i. p.  224.]    [Footnote 39: Tom. ii. p. 127.]    [Footnote 40: In the sacristy of the Angioli is preserved the most  ancient portrait of San Francesco that is extant. It is painted on the  panel which served as the saint's couch until the period of his decease,  as we learn from the inscription. It is there supposed to be the work of  some Greek artist anterior to Giunta.]    [Footnote 41: See Signor Ab. Bettinelli, _Risorgimento d' Italia negli  studii, nelle arti, ne' costumi dopo il mille_, p. 192.]    [Footnote 42: To this list of early painters might perhaps be added the  name of Francesco Benani, by whom there is a whole length figure of St.  Jerome holding a crucifix in his hand. It possesses all the  characteristics attributed by Lanzi to this early age. Near the bottom  of the picture is a label, inscribed, Franciscus Benanus, Filius Petri  Ablada. The size of the picture is 2 feet 8 by 2 feet 2, on panel,  covered with gypsum. The vehicle of the colours is probably prepared  from eggs, which were usually employed for that purpose before the  invention of painting in oil, and to which an absorbent ground of lime  or gypsum seems to have been indispensable. It is surprising how well  the early pictures executed in this style have preserved their colouring  to the present day.]    [Footnote 43: This writer has thrown much light upon the history of our  early painters, from which I have derived and shall continue to derive,  much benefit; but in the heat of dispute, he has frequently depreciated  Cimabue in a way which I cannot approve. For instance, Vasari having  said, that \"he contributed greatly to the perfection of the art,\" della  Valle asserts, that \"he did it neither good nor harm;\" and that having  closely examined the pictures of Cimabue, \"he has found in them a ruder  style than appears in those of Giunta Pisano, of Guido da Siena, of  Jacopo da Turrita, &c.\" (tom. i. p. 235.) Of the two last I shall speak  elsewhere. With respect to the first, the writer contradicts himself  four pages after; when, commenting on another passage of the historian  relating to certain pictures of Cimabue, executed in Assisi in the  inferior church of S. Francesco, he says, that \"he there, in his  opinion, surpassed Giunta Pisano.\" It is to be remembered that this was  his first work, or amongst the first that Cimabue painted in Assisi.  When he went thither, therefore, he was a better artist than Giunta.  How, then, when he worked in the superior church, in Assisi, and in so  many other places, did he become so bad a painter, and more uncouth than  Giunta himself?]    [Footnote 44: See Baldinucci, tom. i. p. 17, Florentine Edition, 1767,  where it is said that the Cimabuoi were also called _Gualtieri_.]    [Footnote 45: But see Baldinucci in _Veglia_, p. 87.]    [Footnote 46: We read, in the preface to the Sienese edition of Vasari's  Lives, (p. 17) as follows: \"To Giunta and to the other artists of Pisa,  as heads of the school, was given the principal direction of adorning  the Franciscan church; and Cimabue and Giotto are known to have been  either disciples or assistants in their school, in which they produced  several important works. Giunta had the direction of his assistant as  long as he resided there, which may have been even subsequent to 1236.  But how are we to suppose that he could have been at Assisi so long as  to permit Cimabue (who was born in 1240, and went to Assisi about 1265)  to assist, to receive instructions from, and to succeed him? Such a  supposition is still more untenable as regards Giotto, who was invited  to Assisi many years afterwards.\" (Vasari.)]    [Footnote 47: To the testimonies in favor of Cimabue, may be added one  of no little weight, from the manuscript given to the public a few years  since, by the Abbate Morelli. We there find that Cimabue painted in  Padua, in the church del Carmine, which was afterwards burnt; but that a  head of S. Giovanni, by him, being rescued from the flames, was inserted  in a frame, and preserved in the house of Alessandro Capella. Would a  painter, who had done neither good nor harm to the Florentine school,  and to the art, have been invited to Padua? Would the remains of his  works have been held in such esteem? Would he have been so highly  valued, after so great a lapse of time, by Vasari, to whose arts he  seems to wish to ascribe the reputation of Cimabue. Other proofs of this  reputation may be seen in the defence of Vasari, in the present Book,  third Epoch. The writer of history ought completely to divest himself of  the love of system and party spirit.]    [Footnote 48: Vasari, tom. i. p. 322.]    [Footnote 49: A book is mentioned by Baldinucci ornamented by Giotto  with miniatures, with histories from the Old Testament, and presented to  the vestry of St. Peter, by Cardinal Stefaneschi; of this he neither  adduces any proof, nor can I find any record. From the evidence, rather,  of an existing necrology, where, among the presents made by Stefaneschi  to the cathedral, the pictures and the mosaic by Giotto are noticed  without any other work of this artist, the gift of the book is very  doubtful. See Sig. Ab, Cancellieri _De Secretariis Veteris Basilicae  Vaticanae_, p. 859, and 2464. Some miniatures of the martyrdom and  miracles of St. George, in another book, are ascribed to him; but I am  uncertain whether there is any ancient document for this; and they  might, possibly, be the work of Simone da Siena, who is often confounded  with him.]    [Footnote 50: See his first volume, pp. 131 and 202; and also P. della  Valle in the preface to Vasari, p. 27; also Signor da Morrona in his  Pisa Illustrata, p. 154; besides many other authors.]    [Footnote 51: D.
