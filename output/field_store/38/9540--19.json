'Knew what, my dear?'    'Why, that you were a good wife,' replied Bob.    'Everybody knows that,' said Peter.    'Very well observed, my boy!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. \"Heartily  sorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in  any way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live. Pray come  to me.\" Now, it wasn't,' cried Bob, 'for the sake of anything he might  be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite  delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt  with us.'    'I'm sure he's a good soul!' said Mrs. Cratchit.    'You would be sure of it, my dear,' returned Bob, 'if you saw and spoke  to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he got  Peter a better situation.'    'Only hear that, Peter,' said Mrs. Cratchit.    'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will be keeping company with  some one, and setting up for himself.'    'Get along with you!' retorted Peter, grinning.    'It's just as likely as not,' said Bob, 'one of these days; though  there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we  part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny  Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?'    'Never, father!' cried they all.    'And I know,' said Bob, 'I know, my dears, that when we recollect how  patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we  shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in  doing it.'    'No, never, father!' they all cried again.    'I am very happy,' said little Bob, 'I am very happy!'    Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young  Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny  Tim, thy childish essence was from God!    'Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our parting moment  is at hand. I know it but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom  we saw lying dead?'    The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before--though at a  different time, he thought: indeed there seemed no order in these latter  visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business  men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for  anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until  besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.    'This court,' said Scrooge, 'through which we hurry now, is where my  place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the  house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.'    The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.    'The house is yonder,' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Why do you point away?'    The inexorable finger underwent no change.    Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an  office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the  figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.    He joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round  before entering.    A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to  learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by  houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,  not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A  worthy place!    The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced  towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he  dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.    'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge,  'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will  be, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?'    Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.    'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,  they must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the  ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!'    The Spirit was immovable as ever.    Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the  finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,  EBENEZER SCROOGE.    'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?' he cried upon his knees.    The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.    'No, Spirit! Oh no, no!'    The finger still was there.    'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me! I am not the  man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this  intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?'    For the first time the hand appeared to shake.    'Good Spirit,' he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it,  'your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may  change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?'    The kind hand trembled.    'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I  will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all  Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they  teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!'    In his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but  he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit stronger yet,  repulsed him.    Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw  an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and  dwindled down into a bedpost.      STAVE FIVE      [Illustration]          THE END OF IT      Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his  own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make  amends in!    'I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!' Scrooge repeated  as he scrambled out of bed. 'The Spirits of all Three shall strive  within me. O Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for  this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!'    He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his  broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing  violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with  tears.    'They are not torn down,' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains  in his arms, 'They are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am  here--the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled.  They will be. I know they will!'    His hands were busy with his garments all this time: turning them inside  out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making  them parties to every kind of extravagance.    'I don't know what to do!' cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the  same breath, and making a perfect Laocoon of himself with his stockings.  'I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as  a schoolboy, I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to  everybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!'    He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there,  perfectly winded.    'There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!' cried Scrooge, starting  off again, and going round the fireplace. 'There's the door by which the  Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There's the corner where the Ghost of  Christmas Present sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering  Spirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!'    Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was  a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long  line of brilliant laughs!    'I don't know what day of the month it is,' said Scrooge. 'I don't know  how long I have been among the Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite  a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!  Hallo here!'    He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the  lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,  bell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clash, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!    Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no  mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood  to dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry  bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!    'What's to-day?' cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday  clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.    'EH?' returned the boy with all his might of wonder.    'What's to-day, my fine fellow?' said Scrooge.    'To-day!' replied the boy. 'Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.'    'It's Christmas Day!' said Scrooge to himself. 'I haven't missed it. The  Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.  Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!'    'Hallo!' returned the boy.    'Do you know the poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?'  Scrooge inquired.    'I should hope I did,' replied the lad.    'An intelligent boy!' said Scrooge. 'A remarkable boy! Do you know  whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--Not  the little prize turkey: the big one?'    'What! the one as big as me?' returned the boy.    'What a delightful boy!' said Scrooge. 'It's a pleasure to talk to him.  Yes, my buck!'    'It's hanging there now,' replied the boy.    'Is it?' said Scrooge. 'Go and buy it.'    'Walk-ER!' exclaimed the boy.    'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to  bring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.

They are not  for the many, but for the few, and only show their best to an  occasional friend whose sympathy can overstep the wall of shyness that  fences them round.    With Honor alone Janie was at her ease, and she would chat away in  their bedroom with a sprightliness that would have amazed the other  members of St. Chad's, if they could have heard her. The two girls got  on well together. Their opposite dispositions seemed to dovetail into  one another, and so to cause little friction; and Miss Maitland, whose  observant eyes noticed more than her pupils imagined, was well  satisfied with the result of her experiment. Janie kept Honor up to the  mark in the way of work; she would generally go over dates or difficult  points in the lessons while they were dressing each morning, and it was  chiefly owing to her efforts that Honor held a tolerably high place in  her class. The latter often wished that she could have performed a like  service for her friend in respect of athletics, but Janie was hopeless  at physical sports, and endured them only under compulsion.    Every afternoon, from two o'clock till a quarter to four, all the girls  were required to take part in organized games, under the direction of  Miss Young, the gymnastic mistress. They were allowed their choice  between cricket and tennis, but during the specified hours they must  not be absent from the playing-fields, as this systematic outdoor  exercise formed part of the ordinary course of the school. Now and then  it was varied by a walk, and occasionally by an archery or croquet  tournament; but these were reserved for insufferably hot days, and the  time, as a rule, was devoted to more active pursuits. The cricket pitch  lay to the west of the College, a splendid, level tract of ground,  commanding a glorious prospect of low, undulating hills, cliffs  bordering a shingly beach, and the long, blue stretch of the Channel  beyond. All the healthy moorland and sea breezes seemed to blow there,  filling the lungs with pure, fresh air, and well justifying Miss  Cavendish's boast that Chessington was the most bracing place in the  kingdom for growing girls. Even Janie's pale cheeks would take a tinge  of pink as she ran, unwillingly enough, in chase of a ball; and the  majority of the school would come in at four o'clock flushed and rosy,  and very ready indeed for the piles of thick bread and butter that  awaited them in the various dining-halls.    Honor took to the games with enthusiasm. Having served an  apprenticeship in the Beginners' Division at cricket, and having shown  Miss Young her capacity in the way of batting and bowling, she was  allowed a place in the St. Chad's team.    It happened that on the very day of her promotion her house played St.  Hilary's, and there was great excitement about the match, because the  latter was generally considered the crack team of the College. That  afternoon, however, the Hilaryites did not quite justify their  reputation. Perhaps the St. Chad's bowling had been extra good; at all  events, the St. Hilary side was dismissed for sixty-seven.    Honor's heart was beating fast when at length her innings arrived, and,  taking her bat, she walked to the wicket. Every eye, she knew, would be  fixed upon her play. A new girl, she was standing her trial before the  school, and on the result of this match would largely depend her  position during the term. She had played cricket during the holidays  with her brothers, and all Derrick's rules came crowding into her mind  as she tried to imagine that she was on the dear, rough old field at  home, with Brian to bowl, and Fergus for long-stop, and Dermot and  Osmond to field, and criticize her strokes afterwards.    She held her bat well, keeping her left shoulder to the bowler and her  eye on the ball. The bat was a light, new one, which the boys had given  her as a parting present, and she felt she could wield it easily.  During the first over she played steadily, but did not attempt to  score. It was one of Derrick's pet maxims that it was folly to try to  do so until you had taken the measure of your opponent, and she wished  to gain confidence.    In the next over her partner, Chatty Burns, made a single, which  brought Honor to the opposite wicket. Gertrude Humphreys's bowling was  more to her taste; it might be described as fast and loose, and Honor,  unlike most girls, did not object to swift bowling, having been  accustomed to it from Brian and Derrick. The first ball she received  came down at a good pace, but well on the off side of the wicket. This  was just the chance she had been waiting for, and a well-timed cut sent  it flying to the boundary for three. The rest of the over was  uneventful, Chatty having evidently made up her mind to be careful.  Winnie Sutcliffe now took up the bowling at the other end, but her  first ball, being a wide, served to increase the confidence that Honor  had felt in breaking her duck. The next ball, though straight on middle  stump, was a half-volley; Honor stepped out to it with a feeling of  exultation, and a moment later it was soaring over the bowler's head  for four.    \"Good!\" \"Well hit, Honor!\" \"St. Chad's for ever!\" \"Hurrah!\" ejaculated  the Chaddites.    Success like this often turns the batter's head, but Honor remembered  in time the many cautions she had received from her critical brothers,  and the next ball, being of good length, she played quietly to long off  for one. Chatty now received the bowling, and, encouraged by Honor's  success, made what the girls afterwards described as the finest leg hit  they had ever seen. Certainly it was a good stroke, taken quite clean  and square, and as it cleared the boards it was marked down six amid  rapturous applause. After that runs came more slowly for a time, and  neither girl appeared inclined to take any risks. This careful play,  however, began to wear down the bowling, especially Gertrude  Humphreys's, which became decidedly loose. Honor, seeing her chance,  suddenly began hitting about her with a spirit and vigour that almost  sent the Chaddites delirious with delight, while even Miss Young was  seen laughing and smiling with Miss Maitland in a manner that seemed to  imply no small self-congratulation on her choice for the last vacancy  in the team.    The Hilaryites were looking decidedly glum at this marked change in the  fortunes of the game. Grace Ward, their captain, at the end of the over  quietly rolled the ball to Ida Bellamy, famed for her slow \"twisters\".  Her first essay pitched well to the leg side, and Honor, who rather  despised \"slows\", made a mighty stroke at it, not allowing for the  break, and missed it altogether. With her heart in her mouth she  glanced rapidly round at the wicket, expecting to see her bails fly;  but luck was on her side, for the break had been a little too great,  and the ball just cleared the off stump.    \"A good thing Derrick isn't here,\" said Honor to herself. \"I should  never have heard the end of that!\"    It was very hard to resist the temptation to hit out, dangerous though  she knew it to be, and it was with a sensation of relief that she saw  the ball travelling off for a single to long field, thus leaving the  rest of the over to Chatty, who, neither so ambitious nor so impatient,  played it out without giving the much-longed-for chance of a catch. By  this time sixty was up on the board, of which Honor had contributed  twenty-eight, to the great satisfaction of all concerned.    But Grace had not played her last card. She had evidently decided on a  double change of bowling; for, when the fielders had crossed, Irene  Richmond was seen at the wicket. Irene's bowling was peculiar; it was  left-handed, which is quite uncommon in a girl, and the more difficult  on that account. The Chaddites looked at one another with smiles that  were less spontaneous.    Certainly Irene might with advantage have been put on before. Her  style, though by no means swift, was most awkward to play. Chatty  received the first ball, which beat her completely, though luckily it  did not touch the wicket. A minute later she made a single, and Honor  felt rather blank, as it was now her turn to face the bowling. One of  Derrick's pet rules, however, came into her mind: \"When you're in  doubt, watch each ball carefully, till you get your eye in\"; and by  dint of adherence to this, she played out the over with safety.    The slow bowling at the other end, though it looked so simple, was full  of weird pitfalls, into one of which Chatty fell an easy victim. She  played too soon at a short-pitched ball, and spooned a catch to mid-on,  who took good care not to drop it. Chatty retired rather ruefully, but  was consoled by the applause she received from the pavilion, her  twenty-three runs being regarded as a handsome contribution.    Maisie Talbot came in next. Being tall and athletic for her age, she  had a long reach, which she employed successfully in driving the first  ball she received right along the ground into \"the country\" for three.  This seemed to disconcert the bowler; the next one she sent down was an  easy full pitch. Honor waited till just the right moment, and then,  with a fine swing of her bat, sent the ball clean over the boundary for  six, a performance that quite \"brought down the house\", even the  Hilaryites joining in the cheering. For a moment no one seemed to have  realized how the score was going, but when seventy went up on the board  there was a wild rush for the pavilion, for the match was won.    Honor's friends were loud in their congratulations, and Janie, who had  been an excited spectator, was almost as proud as if the success had  been her own. Vivian Holmes herself actually expressed approval.    \"Well played, Honor Fitzgerald!\" she said. \"I expect some day you'll be  a credit to St. Chad's.\"    As Vivian was generally more ready to \"squash\" new-co"]]]
