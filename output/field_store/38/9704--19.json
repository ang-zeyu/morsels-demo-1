Their footprints being well defined in the moist  sandy soil, we soon found the herd again; but as they now knew they were  pursued, they kept moving on in short runs at a time, when, occasionally  gaining glimpses of their large dark bodies as they forced through the  bush, I repeated my shots and struck a good number, some more and some  less severely. This was very provoking; for all of them being stern  shots were not likely to kill, and the jungle was so thick I could not  get a front view of them. Presently, however, one with her hind leg  broken pulled up on a white-ant hill, and, tossing her horns, came down  with a charge the instant I showed myself close to her. One crack of the  rifle rolled her over, and gave me free scope to improve the bag, which  was very soon done; for on following the spoors, the traces of blood led  us up to another one as lame as the last. He then got a second bullet  in the flank, and, after hobbling a little, evaded our sight and  threw himself into a bush, where we not sooner arrived than he plunged  headlong at us from his ambush, just, and only just, giving me time to  present my small 40-gauge Lancaster.    It was a most ridiculous scene. Suliman by my side, with the instinct of  a monkey, made a violent spring and swung himself by a bough immediately  over the beast, whilst Faraj bolted away and left me single-gunned to  polish him off. There was only one course to pursue, for in one instant  more he would have been into me; so, quick as thought, I fired the gun,  and, as luck would have it, my bullet, after passing through the edge of  one of his horns, stuck in the spine of his neck, and rolled him over at  my feet as dead as a rabbit. Now, having cut the beast's throat to make  him \"hilal,\" according to Mussulman usage, and thinking we had done  enough if I could only return to the first wounded bull and settle him  too, we commenced retracing our steps, and by accident came on Grant.  He was passing by from another quarter, and became amused by the glowing  description of my boys, who never omitted to narrate their own cowardice  as an excellent tale. He begged us to go on in our course, whilst he  would go back and send us some porters to carry home the game.    Now, tracking back again to the first point of attack, we followed the  blood of the first bull, till at length I found him standing like a  stuck pig in some bushes, looking as if he would like to be put out of  his miseries. Taking compassion, I levelled my Blisset; but, as bad luck  would have it, a bough intercepted the flight of the bullet, and it went  \"pinging\" into the air, whilst the big bull went off at a gallop. To  follow on was no difficulty, the spoor was so good; and in ten minutes  more, as I opened on a small clearance, Blisset in hand, the great  beast, from the thicket on the opposite side, charged down like a mad  bull, full of ferocity--as ugly an antagonist as ever I saw, for the  front of his head was all shielded with horn. A small mound fortunately  stood between us, and as he rounded it, I jumped to one side and let fly  at his flank, but without the effect of stopping him; for, as quick as  thought, the huge monster was at my feet, battling with the impalpable  smoke of my gun, which fortunately hung so thick on the ground at the  height of his head that he could not see me, though I was so close that  I might, had I been possessed of a hatchet, have chopped off his head.  This was a predicament which looked very ugly, for my boys had both  bolted, taking with them my guns; but suddenly the beast, evidently  regarding the smoke as a phantom which could not be mastered, turned  round in a bustle, to my intense relief, and galloped off at full speed,  as if scared by some terrible apparition.    O what would I not then have given for a gun, the chance was such a  good one! Still, angry though I was, I could not help laughing as the  dastardly boys came into the clearance full of their mimicry, and joked  over the scene they had witnessed in security, whilst my life was in  jeopardy because they were too frightened to give me my gun. But now  came the worst part of the day; for, though rain was falling, I had not  the heart to relinquish my game. Tracking on through the bush, I thought  every minute I should come up with the brute; but his wounds ceased to  bleed, and in the confusion of the numerous tracks which scored all the  forest we lost our own.    Much disappointed at this, I now proposed to make for the track we came  by in the morning, and follow it down into camp; but this luxury was not  destined to be our lot that night, for the rain had obliterated all our  footprints of the morning, and we passed the track, mistaking it for the  run of wild beasts. It struck me we had done so; but say what I would,  the boys thought they knew better; and the consequence was that, after  wandering for hours no one knew where--for there was no sun to guide  us--I pulled up, and swore I would wait for the stars, else it might be  our fate to be lost in the wilderness, which I did not much relish. We  were all at this time \"hungry as hunters,\" and beginning to feel very  miserable from being wet through. What little ammunition I had left I  fired off as signals, or made tinder of to get up a fire, but the  wood would not burn. In this hapless condition the black boys began  murmuring, wishing to go on, pretending, though both held opposite  views, that each knew the way; for they thought nothing could be worse  than their present state of discomfort.    Night with its gloom was then drawing on, heightened by thunder and  lightning, which set in all around us. At times we thought we heard  musketry in camp, knowing that Grant would be sure to fire signals  for us; and doubtless we did so, but its sound and the thunder so much  resembled one another that we distrusted our ears. At any rate, the  boys mistook the west for the east; and as I thought they had done so, I  stood firm to one spot, and finally lay down with them to sleep upon  the cold wet ground, where we slept pretty well, being only disturbed  occasionally by some animals sniffing at our feet. As the clouds broke  towards morning, my obstinate boys still swore that west was east, and  would hardly follow me when tracking down Venus; next up rose the moon  and then followed the sun, when, as good luck would have it, we struck  on the track, and walked straight into camp.    Here every one was in a great state of excitement: Grant had been making  the men fire volleys. The little sheikh was warmly congratulatory as  he spoke of the numbers who had strayed away and had been lost in that  wilderness; whilst Bombay admitted he thought we should turn up again  if I did not listen to the advice of the boys, which was his only fear.  Nothing as yet, I now found, had been done to further our march. The  hongo, the sheikh said, had to precede everything; yet that had not been  settled, because the chief deferred it the day of our arrival, on the  plea that it was the anniversary of Short-legs's death; and he also said  that till then all the Wagogo had been in mourning by ceasing to wear  all their brass bracelets and other ornaments, and they now wished to  solemnise the occasion by feasting and renewing their finery. This  being granted, the next day another pretext for delay was found, by the  Wahumba having made a raid on their cattle, which necessitated the chief  and all his men turning out to drive them away; and to-day nothing could  be attended to, as a party of fugitive Wanyamuezi had arrived and  put them all in a fright. These Wanyamuezi, it then transpired, were  soldiers of Manua Sera, the \"Tippler,\" who was at war with the Arabs. He  had been defeated at Mguru, a district in Unyamuezi, by the Arabs, and  had sent these men to cut off the caravan route, as the best way of  retaliation that lay in his power.    At last the tax having been settled by the payment of one dubani, two  barsati, one sahari, six yards merikani, and three yards kiniki (not,  however, until I had our tents struck, and threatened to march away if  the chief would not take it), I proposed going on with the journey,  for our provisions were stored, but when the loads were being lifted,  I found ten more men were missing; and as nothing now could be done but  throw ten loads away, which seemed to great a sacrifice to be made in a  hurry, I simply changed ground to show we were ready to march, and sent  my men about, either to try to induce the fugitive Wanyamuezi to take  service with me or else to buy donkeys, as the chief said he had some to  sell.    We had already been here too long. A report was now spread that a lion  had killed one of the chief's cows; and the Wagogo, suspecting that our  being here was the cause of this ill luck, threatened to attack us. This  no sooner got noised over the camp than all my Wanyamuezi porters, who  had friends in Ugogo, left to live with them, and would not come back  again even when the \"storm had blown over,\" because they did not like  the incessant rains that half deluged the camp. The chief, too, said he  would not sell us his donkeys, lest we should give them back to Mohinna,  from whom they were taken during his fight here. Intrigues of all sorts  I could see were brewing, possibly at the instigation of the fugitive  Wanyamuezi, who suspected we were bound to side with the Arabs--possibly  from some other cause, I could not tell what; so, to clear out of this  pandemonium as soon as possible I issued cloths to buy double rations,  intending to cross the wilderness by successive relays in double the  ordinary number of days. I determined at the same time to send forward  two freed men to Kaze to ask Musa and the Arabs to send me out some  provisions and men to meet us half-way.    Matters grew worse and worse. The sultan, now finding me unable to move,  sent a message to say if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#16)"],[1,"her first.    \"Hush, Maimie; hush, dear. You are quite safe now. Let me see your face.  There now, be quiet, child. The danger is all over.\"    Still Maimie kept screaming. She was thoroughly terrified.    \"Listen to me,\" her aunt said, in an even, firm voice. \"Do not be  foolish. Let me look at you.\"    The quiet, firm voice soothed her, and Maimie's screams ceased. Her aunt  examined her face, neck, and arms for any signs of fire, but could find  none. She was hardly touched, so swift had been her rescue. Then Mrs.  Murray, suddenly putting her arms round about her niece, and holding her  tight, cried: \"Thank God, my darling, for his great kindness to you and  to us all. Thank God! thank God!\"    Her voice broke, but in a moment, recovering herself, she went on, \"And  Ranald, too! noble fellow!\"    Ranald was standing at the back of the crowd, looking pale, disturbed,  and awkward. Mrs. Murray, knowing how hateful to him would be any  demonstrations of feeling, went to him, and quietly held out her hand,  saying: \"It was bravely done, Ranald. From my heart, I thank you.\"    For a moment or two she looked steadily into his face with tears  streaming down her cheeks. Then putting her hands upon his shoulders,  she said, softly:    \"For her dear, dead mother's sake, I thank you.\"    Then Maimie, who had been standing in a kind of stupor all this while,  seemed suddenly to awake, and running swiftly toward Ranald, she put out  both hands, crying: \"Oh, Ranald, I can never thank you enough!\"    He took her hands in an agony of embarrassment, not knowing what to do  or say. Then Maimie suddenly dropped his hands, and throwing her arms  about his neck, kissed him, and ran back to her aunt's side.    \"I thought you didn't play forfeits, Maimie,\" said Don, in a grieved  voice. And every one was glad to laugh.    Then the minister's wife, looking round upon them all, said: \"Dear  children, God has been very good to us, and I think we ought to give him  thanks.\"    And standing there by the fire, they bowed their heads in a new  thanksgiving to Him whose keeping never fails by day or night. And then,  with hearts and voices subdued, and with quiet good nights, they went  their ways home.    But as the Cameron sleigh drove off with its load, Maimie looked back,  and seeing Ranald standing by the fire, she whispered to her aunt: \"Oh,  auntie! Isn't he just splendid?\"    But her aunt made no reply, seeing a new danger for them both, greater  than that they had escaped.        CHAPTER IX    A SABBATH DAY'S WORK      The Sabbath that followed the sugaring-off was to Maimie the most  remarkable Sabbath of her life up to that day. It was totally unlike the  Sabbath of her home, which, after the formal \"church parade,\" as  Harry called it, in the morning, her father spent in lounging with his  magazine and pipe, her aunt in sleeping or in social gossip with such  friends as might drop in, and Harry and Maimie as best they could.    The Sabbath in the minister's house, as in the homes of his people, was  a day so set apart from other days that it had to be approached. The  Saturday afternoon and evening caught something of its atmosphere. No  frivolity, indeed no light amusement, was proper on the evening that put  a period to the worldly occupations and engagements of the week. That  evening was one of preparation. The house, and especially the kitchen,  was thoroughly \"redd up.\" Wood, water, and kindlings were brought in,  clothes were brushed, boots greased or polished, dinner prepared, and  in every way possible the whole house, its dwellers, and its belongings,  made ready for the morrow. So, when the Sabbath morning dawned, people  awoke with a feeling that old things had passed away and that the whole  world was new. The sun shone with a radiance not known on other days. He  was shining upon holy things, and lighting men and women to holy duties.  Through all the farms the fields lay bathed in his genial glow, at rest,  and the very trees stood in silent worship of the bending heavens. Up  from stable and from kitchen came no sounds of work. The horses knew  that no wheel would turn that day in labor, and the dogs lay sleeping in  sunny nooks, knowing as well as any that there was to be no hunting or  roaming for them that day, unless they chose to go on a free hunt; which  none but light-headed puppies or dissipated and reprobate dogs would  care to do.    Over all things rest brooded, and out of the rest grew holy thoughts  and hopes. It was a day of beginnings. For the past, broken and stained,  there was a new offer of oblivion and healing, and the heart was  summoned to look forward to new life and to hope for better things, and  to drink in all those soothing, healing influences that memory and faith  combine to give; so that when the day was done, weary and discouraged  men and women began to feel that, perhaps after all they might be able  to endure and even to hope for victory.    The minister rose earlier on Sabbath than on other days, the  responsibility of his office pressing hard upon him. Breakfast was more  silent than usual, ordinary subjects of conversation being discouraged.  The minister was preoccupied and impatient of any interruption of his  thoughts. But his wife came to the table with a sweeter serenity than  usual, and a calm upon her face that told of hidden strength. Even  Maimie could notice the difference, but she could only wonder. The  secret of it was hidden from her. Her aunt was like no other woman that  she knew, and there were many things about her too deep for Maimie's  understanding.    After worship, which was brief but solemn and intense, Lambert hurried  to bring round to the front the big black horse, hitched up in the  carryall, and they all made speed to pack themselves in, Maimie and her  aunt in front, and Hughie on the floor behind with his legs under the  seat; for when once the minister was himself quite ready, and had got  his great meerschaum pipe going, it was unsafe for any one to delay him  a single instant.    The drive to the church was an experience hardly in keeping with the  spirit of the day. It was more exciting than restful. Black was a horse  with a single aim, which was to devour the space that stretched out  before him, with a fine disregard of consequence. The first part of the  road up to the church hill and down again to the swamp was to Black, as  to the others, an unmixed joy, for he was fresh from his oats and eager  to go, and his driver was as eager to let him have his will.    But when the swamp was reached, and the buggy began to leap from log  to log of the corduroy, Black began to chafe in impatience of the rein  which commanded caution. Indeed, the passage of the swamp was always  more or less of an adventure, the result of which no one could foretell,  and it took all Mrs. Murray's steadiness of nerve to repress an  exclamation of terror at critical moments. The corduroy was Black's  abomination. He longed to dash through and be done with it; but, however  much the minister sympathized with Black's desire, prudence forbade that  his method should be adopted. So from log to log, and from hole to hole,  Black plunged and stepped with all the care he could be persuaded to  exercise, every lurch of the carryall bringing a scream from Maimie in  front and a delighted chuckle from Hughie behind. His delight in the  adventure was materially increased by his cousin's terror.    But once the swamp was crossed, and Black found himself on the firm  road that wound over the sand-hills and through the open pine woods, he  tossed his great mane back from his eyes, and getting his head set off  at a pace that foreboded disaster to anything trying to keep before him,  and in a short time drew up at the church gates, his flanks steaming and  his great chest white with foam.    \"My!\" said Maimie, when she had recovered her breath sufficiently to  speak, \"is that the church?\" She pointed to a huge wooden building about  whose door a group of men were standing.    \"Huh-huh, that's it,\" said Hughie; \"but we will soon be done with the  ugly old thing.\"    The most enthusiastic member of the congregation could scarcely call the  old church beautiful, and to Maimie's eyes it was positively hideous.  No steeple or tower gave any hint of its sacred character. Its  weather-beaten clapboard exterior, spotted with black knots, as if  stricken with some disfiguring disease, had nothing but its row of  uncurtained windows to distinguish it from an ordinary barn.    They entered by the door at the end of the church, and proceeded down  the long aisle that ran the full length of the building, till they came  to a cross aisle that led them to the minister's pew at the left side  of the pulpit, and commanding a view of the whole congregation. The main  body of the church was seated with long box pews with hinged doors. But  the gallery that ran round three sides was fitted with simple benches.  Immediately in front of the pulpit was a square pew which was set apart  for the use of the elders, and close up to the pulpit, and indeed as  part of this structure, was a precentor's desk. The pulpit was, to  Maimie's eyes, a wonder. It was an octagonal box placed high on one  side of the church on a level with the gallery, and reached by a spiral  staircase. Above it hung the highly ornate and altogether extraordinary  sounding-board and canopy. There was no sign of paint anywhere, but  the yellow pine, of which seats, gallery, and pulpit were all made, had  deepened with age into a rich brown, not unpleasant to the eye.    The church was full, for the Indian Lands people believed in going  to church, and there was not a house for many miles around but was  represented in the church that day. There they sat, row upon row of men,  brawny and brown with wind and sun, a notable company, worthy of their  ancestry and worthy of their heritage. Beside them sat their wives,  brown,"]]]
