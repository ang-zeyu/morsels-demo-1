[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#16)"],[1,"Lelaks in the Baram) practise a  curious symbolic ceremony on the adoption of a child. When a couple has  arranged to adopt a child, both man and wife observe for some weeks  before the ceremony all the prohibitions usually observed during  the later months of pregnancy. Many of these prohibitions may be  described in general terms by saying that they imply abstention from  every action that may suggest difficulty or delay in delivery; E.G. the  hand must not be thrust into any narrow hole to pull anything out of  it; no fixing of things with wooden pegs must be done; there must be  no lingering on the threshold on entering or leaving a room. When the  appointed day arrives, the woman sits in her room propped up and with a  cloth round her, in the attitude commonly adopted during delivery. The  child is pushed forward from behind between the woman's legs, and,  if it is a young child, it is put to the breast and encouraged to  suck. Later it receives a new name.    It is very difficult to obtain admission that a particular child  has been adopted and is not the actual offspring of the parents;  and this seems to be due, not so much to any desire to conceal the  facts as to the completeness of the adoption, the parents coming to  regard the child as so entirely their own that it is difficult to find  words which will express the difference between the adopted child and  the offspring. This is especially the case if the woman has actually  suckled the child.      Proper Names    The child remains nameless during the first few years, and is spoken  of as UKAT if a boy, OWING if a girl, both of which seem to be best  translated as Thingumybob; among the Sea Dayaks ULAT (the little grub)  is the name commonly used. It is felt that to give the child a name  while its hold of life is still feeble is undesirable, because the  name would tend to draw the attention of evil spirits to it. During  its third or fourth year it is given a name at the same time as a  number of other children of the house.[42] The name is chosen with  much deliberation, the eldest son and daughter usually receiving  the names of a grandfather and grandmother respectively. Male and  female names are distinct. The name first given to any person is  rarely carried through life; it is usually changed after any severe  illness or serious accident, in order that the evil influences that  have pursued him may fail to recognise him under the new name; thus  the first or infant name of Tama Bulan was Lujah. After bearing it a  few years he went through a serious illness, on account of which his  name was changed to Wang. Among the Klemantans it is usual under these  circumstances to name the child after some offensive object, E.G. TAI  (dung), in order to render it inconspicuous, and thus withdraw it from  the attention of malign powers. After the naming of a couple's first  child, the parents are always addressed as father and mother of the  child; E.G. if the child's name is OBONG, her father becomes known as  TAMA OBONG, her mother as INAI OBONG, and their original names are  disused and almost forgotten,[43] unless needed to distinguish the  parents from other persons of the same name, when the old names are  appended to the new; thus, Tama Obong Jau, if Jau was the original  name of Tama Obong; and thus Tama Bulan received this name on the  naming of his first child, Bulan (the moon), and when it is wished to  distinguish him in conversation from other fathers of the moon he is  called Tama Bulan Wang. If the eldest child OBONG dies, the father,  Tama Obong Jau, becomes OYONG JAU; if one of his younger children  dies, he becomes AKAM JAU; if his wife dies, he becomes ABAN JAU;  if his brother died, he would be called YAT JAU; and if his sister,  HAWAN JAU; and if two of these relatives are dead, these titles are  used indifferently; but the deaths of wife and children are predominant  over other occasions for the change of name. An elderly man who has  no children receives the title LINGO, and a woman, the title APA  prefixed to his or her former name. A widow is called BALU. The names  of father and mother are never assumed by the children, and their  deaths do not occasion any change of name, except the adoption of  the title OYAU on the loss of the father, and ILUN on the loss of  the mother. These titles would be used only until the man became a  father. When a man becomes a grandfather his title is LAKI (E.G. LAKI  JAU), and this title supersedes all others. A child addresses, and  speaks of, his father as TAMAN, and his mother as INAI or TINAN,  and all four grandparents as POI. The parent commonly addresses the  child, even when adult, as ANAK, or uses his proper name. A father's  brother is addressed as AMAI, but this title is used also as a term  of respect in addressing any older man not related in any degree,  even though he be of a different tribe or race. They use the word  INAI for aunt as well as for mother, and some have adopted the Malay  term MA MANAKAN for aunt proper. The same is true of the words for  nephew and niece -- the Malay term ANAK MANAKAN being used for both.    The terms used to denote degrees of kinship are few, and are used  in a very elastic manner. The term of widest connotation is PARIN  IGAT, which is equivalent to our cousin used in the wider or Scotch  sense; it is applied to all blood relatives of the same generation,  and is sometimes used in a metaphorical sense much as we use the  term brother. There are no words corresponding to our words son and  daughter, ANAK meaning merely child of either sex. There are no words  corresponding to brother and sister; both are spoken of as PARIN,  but this word is often used as a title of endearment in addressing or  speaking of a friend of either sex of the same social standing and age  as the speaker. The children of the same parents speak of themselves  collectively as PANAK; this term also is sometimes used loosely and  metaphorically. A step-father is TAMAN DONG; father-in-law is TAMAN  DIVAN; forefather is SIPUN, a term used of any male or female ancestor  more remote than the grandparents; but these are merely descriptive  and not terms of address. A man of the upper class not uncommonly  has a favourite companion of the middle class, who accompanies him  everywhere and renders him assistance and service, and shares his  fortunes (FIDUS ACHATES in short); him he addresses as BAKIS, and the  title is used reciprocally. A title reciprocally used by those who are  very dear friends, especially by those who have enjoyed the favours  of the same fair one, is TOYONG (or among the Sea Dayaks -- IMPRIAN).    This list includes all the important Kayan terms used to denote  personal relations and kinship, so far as we know; and we think it  very improbable that any have escaped us. There seem to be no secret  names, except in so far as names discarded on account of misfortune are  not willingly recalled or communicated; but a child's name is seldom  used, and adults also seem to avoid calling on one another by their  proper names, especially when in the jungle, the title alone, such as  OYONG, or ABAN being commonly used; apparently owing to some vaguely  conceived risk of directing to the individual named the attentions  of malevolent powers.[44]    The foregoing account of the social organisation of the Kayans applies  equally well to the Kenyahs, except that some of the titles used  are different. The Klemantans and Muruts, too, present few important  differences except that the power of the chiefs is decidedly less,  and the distinction of the social strata less clearly marked, and  slaves are less numerous. The Sea Dayak social organisation is also  similar in most of its features. The most important of the differences  presented by it are the following: -- Polygamy is not allowed, and  occurs only illicitly. Both parties are fined when the facts are  discovered. Divorce is very common and easily obtained; the marriage  relation, being surrounded with much less solemnity, is more easily  entered into and dissolved. Infidelity and mutual agreement are the  common occasions of divorce. Either party can readily secure his or  her freedom by payment of a small fine. There are both men and women  who have married many times; a tenth husband or wife is not unknown;  and a marriage may be dissolved within a week of its consummation.    The Sea Dayak, like all the other peoples, regards incest very  seriously, and the forbidden degrees of kinship are well understood  and very similar to those of Kayans.    A Sea Dayak village consists in almost every case of a single house,  but such houses are generally grouped within easy reach of one  another. Very few slaves are to be found in their houses, since the  Ibans usually take the heads of all their conquered enemies rather  than make slaves of them.      Inheritance of Property    At a man's death his property is divided between his widow and  children. But in order to prevent the disputes, which often arise  over the division of inheritance, an old man may divide his property  before his death. The widow becomes the head of the room, though a  married son or daughter or several unmarried children may share it  with her. She inherits all or most of the household utensils. Such  things as gongs and other brass ware, weapons, war-coats, and boats,  are divided equally among the sons, the eldest perhaps getting a  little more than the others. The girls divide the old beads, cloth,  bead-boxes, and various trifles. The male slaves go to the sons,  the female slaves to the daughters. Bird's nest caves and bee trees  might be divided or shared among all the children.    It happens not infrequently that one son or daughter, remaining  unmarried, continues to live in the household of the parents and to  look after them in their old age. To such a one some valuable article,  such as a string of old beads or costly jar, is usually "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#16)"],[1,"mself. His  stories were recorded in Latin by Poggio Bracciolini, the Pope's  secretary, for his master's information. Translated into Portuguese,  they were re-translated from the Portuguese into Italian by Ramusio,  who searched for but failed to obtain a copy of the original in  Latin. This original was first published in 1723 by the Abbe Oliva  of Paris under the title P. BRACCIOLINI, DE VARIETATE FORTUNAE,  LIBER QUATUOR.    Nicolo, on reaching India, visited first the city of Cambaya  in Gujarat. After twenty days' sojourn there he passed down the  coast to \"Pacamuria,\" probably Barkur, and \"Helly,\" which is the  \"Mount d'Ely\" or \"Cabo d'Eli\" of later writers. Thence he travelled  inland and reached the Raya's capital, Vijayanagar, which he calls  \"Bizenegalia.\"[125] He begins his description thus: --    \"The great city of Bizenegalia is situated near very steep  mountains. The circumference of the city is sixty miles; its walls  are carried up to the mountains and enclose the valleys at their  foot, so that its extent is thereby increased. In this city there  are estimated to be ninety thousand men fit to bear arms.\"    I must here interpose a correction. There were no \"mountains\" properly  so called at Vijayanagar; only a confused and tumbled mass of rocky  hills, some rising to considerable altitude. The extent of its  lines of defences was extraordinary. Lofty and massive stone walls  everywhere crossed the valleys, and led up to and mounted over the  hillsides. The outer lines stretched unbroken across the level country  for several miles. The hollows and valleys between the boulder-covered  heights were filled with habitations, poor and squalid doubtless,  in most instances, but interspersed with the stone-built dwellings  of the nobles, merchants, and upper classes of the vast community;  except where the elaborately constructed water-channels of the Rayas  enabled the land to be irrigated; and in these parts rich gardens  and woods, and luxurious crops of rice and sugar-cane, abounded. Here  and there were wonderfully carved temples and fanes to Hindu deities,  with Brahmanical colleges and schools attached to the more important  amongst their number.    As to the appearance of the scenery, I cannot do better than quote the  description given in 1845 by a distinguished South-Indian geologist,  Lieutenant Newbold:[126] --    \"The whole of the extensive site occupied by the ruins of Bijanugger  on the south bank of the Tumbuddra, and of its suburb Annegundi on the  northern bank, is occupied by great bare piles and bosses of granite  and granitoidal gneiss, separated by rocky defiles and narrow rugged  valleys encumbered by precipitated masses of rock. Some of the larger  flat-bottomed valleys are irrigated by aqueducts from the river.... The  peaks, tors, and logging-stones of Bijanugger and Annegundi indent the  horizon in picturesque confusion, and are scarcely to be distinguished  from the more artificial ruins of the ancient metropolis of the Deccan,  which are usually constructed with blocks quarried from their sides,  and vie in grotesqueness of outline and massiveness of character  with the alternate airiness and solidity exhibited by nature in the  nicely-poised logging stones and columnar piles, and in the walls of  prodigious cuboidal blocks of granite which often crest and top her  massive domes and ridges in natural cyclopean masonry.\"    The remains of palaces, temples, walls, and gateways are still to be  seen, and these abound not only on the site of Vijayanagar proper,  but also on the north side of the swiftly rushing river, where stood  the stately citadel of Anegundi, the mother of the empire-city. The  population of this double city was immense, and the area occupied by  it very extensive. From the last fortification to the south, beyond  the present town of Hospett, to the extreme point of the defences of  Anegundi on the north, the distance is about twelve miles. From the  extreme western line of walls in the plain to the last of the eastern  works amongst the hills lying in the direction of Daroji and Kampli the  interval measures about ten miles. Within this area we find the remains  of the structures of which I have spoken. The hovels have disappeared,  and the debris lies many feet thick over the old ground-level. But the  channels are still in working order, and wherever they exist will be  found rich crops, tall and stately trees, and a tangle of luxuriant  vegetation. On the rocks above are the ruins of buildings and temples  and walls, and in many places small shrines stand out, built on the  jutting edges of great boulders or on the pinnacles of lofty crags, in  places that would seem inaccessible to anything but monkeys and birds.    In the central enclosure are the remains of great structures that  must once have been remarkable for their grandeur and dignity. These  immediately surrounded the king's palace; but in 1565 the Muhammadans  worked their savage will upon them with such effect that only the  crumbling ruins of the more massive edifices amongst them still  stand. The site of the palace itself is marked by a large area of  ground covered with heaps of broken blocks, crushed masonry, and  fragments of sculpture, not one stone being left upon another in its  original position.    To return to Nicolo. He continues: --    \"The inhabitants of this region marry as many wives as they please,  who are burnt with their dead husbands. Their king is more powerful  than all the other kings of India. He takes to himself 12,000 wives,  of whom 4000 follow him on foot wherever he may go, and are employed  solely in the service of the kitchen. A like number, more handsomely  equipped, ride on horseback. The remainder are carried by men in  litters, of whom 2000 or 3000 are selected as his wives on condition  that at his death they should voluntarily burn themselves with him,  which is considered to be a great honour for them....    \"At a certain time of the year their idol is carried through the city,  placed between two chariots, in which are young women richly adorned,  who sing hymns to the god, and accompanied by a great concourse  of people. Many, carried away by the fervour of their faith, cast  themselves on the ground before the wheels, in order that they may be  crushed to death -- a mode of death which they say is very acceptable  to their god. Others, making an incision in their side, and inserting a  rope thus through their body, hang themselves to the chariot by Nay of  ornament, and thus suspended and half-dead accompany their idol. This  kind of sacrifice they consider the best and most acceptable of all.    \"Thrice in the year they keep festivals of especial solemnity. On  one of these occasions the males and females of all ages, having  bathed in the rivers or the sea, clothe themselves in new garments,  and spend three entire days in singing, dancing, and feasting. On  another of these festivals they fix up within their temples, and on  the outside on the roofs, an innumerable number of lamps of oil of  SUSIMANNI, which are kept burning day and night. On the third, which  lasts nine days, they set up in all the highways large beams, like the  masts of small ships, to the upper part of which are attached pieces  of very beautiful cloth of various kinds, interwoven with gold. On the  summit of each of these beams is each day placed a man of pious aspect,  dedicated to religion, capable of enduring all things with equanimity,  who is to pray for the favour of God. These men are assailed by the  people, who pelt them with oranges, lemons, and other odoriferous  fruits, all which they bear most patiently. There are also three  other festival days, during which they sprinkle all passers-by, even  the king and queen themselves, with saffron water, placed for that  purpose by the wayside. This is received by all with much laughter.\"    The first of these festivals may be the Kanarese New Year's Day,  which Domingo Paes in his chronicle asserts to have fallen, during  his visit to Vijayanagar, on October 12 -- \"FESTAS EM QUE TODOS VESTEM  PANOS NOVOS E RICOS E GALANTES, E CADA HUU COMO O TEM, E DAO TODOS OS  CAPITAEES PANOS A TODA SUA GNETE DE MUYTAS CORES E GALANTES.\"[127]  The second should be the Dipavali festival, which occurs about the  month of October, when lamps are lighted by all the householders,  and the temples are illuminated. The description of the third answers  to the nine-days' festival, called the MAHANAVAMI, at Vijayanagar,  which, during the visit of Paes, took place on September 12. The  other feast of three days' duration answers to the HOLI festival.    Conti next describes the finding of diamonds on a mountain which  he called \"Albenigaras\" and places fifteen days' journey beyond  Vijayanagar \"towards the north.\" He repeats the story which we  know as that of \"Sinbad the Sailor,\" saying that the diamonds lie  in inaccessible valleys, into which lumps of flesh being thrown, to  which the precious stones adhere, these are carried up TO the summits  by eagles, which are then driven off and the stones secured. The  direction given, though it should rather be east than north, points to  the mines on the Krishna river being those alluded to -- mines which  are often styled the \"mines of Golkonda\" by travellers. Marco Polo told  the same tale of the same mines in the year 1296. Conti continues: --    \"They divide the year into twelve months, which they name after the  signs of the zodiac. The era is computed variously....\"    After having given a short account of the different coinages and  currencies, which is interesting, but of which the various localities  are left to the imagination, he writes: --    \"The natives of Central India make use of the ballistae,[128] and  those machines which we call bombardas, also other warlike implements  adapted for besieging cities.    \"They call us Franks and say, 'While they call other nations blind,"]]]
