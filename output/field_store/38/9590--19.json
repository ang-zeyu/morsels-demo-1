XII      A summer night, and the heat the heat of the dog-days. The tramcars had  stopped running long ago; the streets were quite deserted.    Not long since, the clock set high in the tower of St. Giles' had chimed  three-quarters; and now it chimed the hour, and wearily struck \"Two.\"  Then other clocks also awoke to their duties, and, not possessing chimes,  repeated the latter information in various keys, from far and near. It  was all very sombre; and the smell of the streets very unlovely.    It was Bill's turn to be up that night; at least, they said it was his  turn. As a matter of fact, he had been up three nights running, and at  least ten in the last eighteen, for this was no ordinary case, and the  credit of the firm was at stake. Not that he held the dignity of being a  member, much less a partner, of the firm; but he had worked for it, he  would often tell, and with no little pride in his voice--\"worked for it  thirty-two years, come Lammas; and that wus a very long while.\"    To Bill, and the few remaining, or still discoverable, like him, the  firm's credit was his; and the firm should never find its confidence  misplaced so long as Bill Withers could walk on his two feet, or aid some  suffering creature. Those were his sentiments. Then, of course, this Bill  had a soft place in his heart for animals generally, though the softest  place of all was unreservedly retained for dogs.    \"They wus human; well, a sight better than human, as any one might see  humans at times\";--that was the way he put it. \"And there warn't a mossel  o' doubt about it, no matter what nobody said.\"    At that, his mates in the yard thought well to let the matter drop.    \"That there Bill has his queer hideas abaht most things; better leave him  to hisself,\" they remarked, with a twist of the mouth, and passed on.    Bill had a habit of speaking his thoughts aloud, especially when up at  night. He found company in the habit, and was employing his time in this  way now.    \"Two o'clock. Another half-hour and he'll have to have the soup, and then  a little stim'lant. That wus the orders. Let's see. To-morrow's Toosday.  That'll make it three weeks since the master brought un back with him in  his motor, all wrapped in blankets. 'Twas that ogg-sigen as saved him at  the moment. But here--he's been fed every two hours, night and day since,  any way. Well, well....\"    There was a step on the cobbles of the yard. Bill looked round. \"Mr.  Charles\"--as he called him--the head of the firm, was coming.    Five weeks before this Murphy had been taken ill. Nobody appeared to know  what was the matter with him, except that he was restless, refused his  food, and looked wrong in his coat. The very spirit there was in him  misled others: he would hunt birds under the smallest provocation;  rabbits were not animals to be given up so long as there was breath in  the body; that finest of games, working to the hand, was to be played to  the last day, for was it not the jolliest of fun for both, and did not  his master laugh loudly when it was all over, and he skipped and barked  and jumped himself, asking for just one more turn? It was only the  chicken-hearted that gave up; life was to be lived to the very last  minute, especially when so full of fun and happiness as his. If he  flagged and was tired after these doings, it was only the hot weather: he  would be all right tomorrow. So he was kept quiet for a week.    But the morrow came, and he was less full of life than on the day before.  There was something evidently wrong; though advice was asked, and with  little gain. His bright eyes had grown dull now, and he refused all food.  It was time to call in the best opinion that could be had.    \"Distemper. Pneumonia; and the heart also affected.\" That was the  verdict. There was just a chance for him. It would be a risk to move him  so far; but it was perhaps worth it, as treatment could then be followed  properly: in establishments of the kind all animals were tended with as  much care and skill as patients in a hospital.    So Murphy was taken away. How suddenly it had all come about. And now  three weeks had gone by; and the dog still lived.    \"How's he doing, Bill?\"    \"No difference to my mind, as I can see.\"    \"We must save him, if we can, Bill. She was here again to-day, and said  the dog was such a very valuable one that she didn't know what would  happen if he died.\"    \"I judged something of the kind,\" remarked Bill. \"I've got a cousin, over  their way: shepherd to Mr. Phipps--him as has Fair Mile Farm. You knows.  He come in with him--'twus last Saturday's market--over some tegs; and he  called in here, and I do believes 'twus to ask how this un here wus. Said  he'd allus liked un. Seemed to know all about un. Said as he and the  gen'leman as owns un wus allus together; that he couldn't get about like  some; and that he and this dog here was never apart, and seemed to hang  together, curious ways like. They'd got some name for the two of 'em down  in that part--so he says; but I a'most forgets what 'twus now.\"    \"So I understand. One or two have been to call to ask after him, up at  the office, and said much the same.\"    \"Been here himself, hasn't he?\" inquired Bill.    \"Ay, yesterday. I told him he couldn't see him; or, rather, that if he  did, with the dog's heart as rocky as it was, I would not answer for the  result. He did not speak a word after that, except--'Do your best'; and  went out.\"    \"From what that cousin o' mine said,\" put in Bill, \"I judge if he'd come  in, it would a-killed the dog right off.\" He was smoothing Murphy's ears  as he spoke.    \"I told him,\" continued Mr. Charles, \"that two things were especially  against this dog; one was his high breeding, and the other, his brain  development. It's the last I'm most afraid of, though.\"    \"Brain? Clever?\" put in Bill--\"I should just say he _was_.\"    \"--And I told him that I had never seen a dog that was easier to treat;  and that he was making a real plucky fight for it.\"    \"That's true,\" said Bill, in a tone as if the words had been \"Amen.\"    \"--And that he was that sensible that he allowed us to do just as we  liked with him; so good and patient that there was not a man in the yard  that wasn't _glad_ to do anything for him.\"    \"True again,\" broke in Bill, with emphasis.--\"Murphy,\" he said, calling  the dog by name. \"Whew! Another hot day, I judge; coming light afore  long.\" Bill was looking at the sky.    \"All against him; all against him,\" returned the other. \"But there, I  shall be downright sorry if we lose him now.\"    Bill shook his head. \"See all as has been done ... and the telegrams ...  and the letters, and ...\"    The conversation of the two men was stopped by a low bark from the dog.    \"Dreaming,\" said Bill; \"does a lot o' sleep.\"    \"Brain,\" said the other, listening--\"I feared as much all along. It's all  up, Bill.\"    Bill was down, and had got one of his hands under the dog's head.    The bark came again: only a very weak one; not enough to disturb anybody  near. It became continuous after that; grew a little louder; then  gradually fainter.    Perhaps he was hunting birds, though it may be doubted. More likely he  was working to the hand over the sunlit fields, in the glad air, with a  full life all before him yet; and in the company of one whom he loved  with his whole heart, and to whom, while learning constantly himself, he,  a dog, had taught no end of things.    There can be little doubt that he was working by the hand. Of course he  was. But the hand that was beckoning him now was from over the  border--from the land where there is room for both the man and the dog,  and where there shall be a blessed reunion with old friends.    The bark died away: Murphy was dead.    \"Not five years; or only just,\" remarked Bill.    Both men heaved a sigh.    Day was breaking as they walked away together down the yard.                        *       *       *       *       *    A few days later came this, written by one whose business it was to tend  the sick and the suffering among animals; to whom their passing was no  rare event; and who must have had many thousands through his hands:    \"I am so very sorry; but it was really a happy release after the brain  symptoms had developed.    \"I can only say your dog won the affection of all of us here to an extent  unequalled by any other patient. I think this was due to the very brave  way that he bore his sufferings, his kind and amenable temperament, and  his almost human intelligence. There is no doubt that this last increased  the susceptibility of his brain to disease, and made recovery hopeless.\"                        *       *       *       *       *    Two men were working their way slowly up the Dene. They were the  shepherd, Job Nutt, and his second. And their dogs followed them closely  to heel.    They had just set out a new bait for the sheep on the vetches lower down,  and were making for home.    Violet shadows had stretched themselves out to their furthest over the  red wheat, now rapidly ripening; soon they would fade out altogether, and  the woods would grow blue. For the sun was touching the line of the  distant hills, and the long day's work was done.    \"Why, there goes Him,\" says one, pointing up at the down to the eastward.    \"So it be,\" returns the other--\"Him and his ... Oh ah! but I was a-most  forgettin'. I allus liked that dog\"; and Job Nutt waved his hand.                        [Illustration: \"Alas!\" by Him.]    All knew it. Contrary to what is generally supposed, certain items of  news circulate rapidly among farm-folk.                                            XIII      It was only a dog.    Perhaps so.    The fact does not forbid the familiar question that rises always at  certain hours to the mind of man, and will continue to do so till time  shall cease, whether his friend take human or only canine form in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],[0,"The Story of Leather (#16)"],[1,"the edge of one of the great boxes and tried to turn it over.    Now it happened that the boys, struggling to remain unseen, had huddled  into this very box.    \"The case is heavy, Tyler. I can't stir it. Just see what is in it.\"    Mr. Tyler, alert to obey, dragged forth the case with the assistance of  the insurance agent and when it was tipped up and Peter and Nat tumbled  out on the floor three more astonished men never were seen.    [Illustration: THE THREE MEN STEPPED FORWARD]    \"How did you two boys get here?\" questioned Mr. Tyler severely. \"What  are you doing?\"    Nat, thoroughly terrified, looked helplessly at Peter. He couldn't have  answered had he tried. Peter himself was a good deal taken aback. He  glanced at his father for some hint as to how to proceed, but Mr.  Coddington's face was a study in conflicting emotions and furnished no  clue. Therefore, after waiting a moment and receiving no aid in his  dilemma, Peter replied simply:    \"We are eating our luncheon.\"    \"Eating your lunch! And who told you you might come here for such a  purpose?\"    \"Nobody. It just was a big, empty place with lots of sunshine and it  seemed nicer than eating down-stairs,\" gasped Peter.    \"Are you sure they were eating their lunch and not starting a fire?\"  suggested the insurance inspector in an undertone.    \"Of course we weren't setting a fire!\" Peter cried indignantly, hearing  the whispered words of the inspector. \"We just came up here to get where  it was clean and quiet. When it is too cold to go out there isn't any  place to eat except right in the factory.\"    \"Well, that is no excuse for your coming here. It is against the  rule for any of the employees to come above the fourth floor without  permission. I thought you both understood that. If you didn't it is your  own fault. You may finish out your week here and on Saturday night you  may consider yourselves discharged from the tannery.\" Mr. Tyler put his  hand on Peter's shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Strong,\" he added.    \"Just one moment, Tyler.\"    It was Mr. Coddington who spoke.    \"Tell me more fully about this matter, Peter Strong. You say you have no  suitable place to eat your lunch.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What do the other men do?\"    \"They sit around under the machinery anywhere they can. Often the place  is dirty and sometimes it is hot. If the windows are opened to air the  rooms the men get cold,\" answered Peter.    \"Strong is a little fussy, I am afraid, Mr. Coddington,\" interrupted Mr.  Tyler. \"The conditions are the same as they always have been--the same  as they are in most mills. The men can go home at noon if they like.\"    \"But they can't get home, and eat anything, and get back here, all  within an hour,\" objected Peter. \"Besides, they are often too tired. It  is much easier to stay right in the tannery. Of course in warm weather  we have the park and can go outside, so then we are all right; but  during the winter----\"    \"That will do, Strong,\" cut in Mr. Tyler. \"Remember your time is up this  week. What's your name?\" The superintendent turned severely on Nat.    \"Jackson.\"    \"Oh, yes--Jackson. You are the boy who was hurt.\"    Nat nodded.    \"I am sorry to see that you are making such a poor return to the company  for its kindness to you. It is unfortunate all around. But we cannot  have the rules of the tannery broken. Mr. Coddington will, I am sure,  agree with me there.\"    \"Undoubtedly, Tyler. Any person who is at fault should be punished. In  this particular case, however, just who _is_ at fault? If, as the lads  say, they have nowhere to go at noon, is the fault wholly theirs if they  seek a remedy from their discomfort? Suppose we suspend their sentence  until we investigate the conditions and simply caution them not to  repeat the offense. Had these empty cases not been left here by some  negligent persons seclusion would have been impossible. Somebody beside  the boys was to blame. Order the boxes removed and drop the matter.\"    Without another word Mr. Coddington stalked toward the elevator and the  men who accompanied him had no choice but to follow.    Peter and Nat breathed a sigh of relief.    There had been but a hair's breadth between them and a discharge from  the tannery! To Peter the danger was not a very real one, but Nat, who  was in ignorance of the true facts, was pale with fright.    \"Whew, Peter! That was a close call,\" he stammered. \"A narrow squeak!  But for Mr. Coddington we should both have been fired. I don't know what  I should have done if I had lost my place. It was mighty good of him to  give us another chance, wasn't it?\"    \"Mr. Coddington is all right, you can bet your life on that!\" agreed  Peter heartily. \"It was lucky, though, that he was here.\"    Still aglow with excitement, the boys flew down over the stairs and took  up their work, making no further allusion to the incident.    But that night when Peter got home his father called him into the  library and motioning to a chair before the open fire, observed dryly:    \"Your friend Strong had a narrow escape to-day, Peter.\"    \"Yes, sir. But for you he would have lost his job.\"    \"I'm afraid so,\" the president nodded. \"Since noon I have been thinking  the matter over. What Strong said brought things before me in an  entirely new light. I don't think I ever realized before some of the  conditions at the tanneries.\"    Peter waited.    \"If it were possible--mind, I do not say it could be done--but if a  scheme could be worked out to make a big sort of rest room where the men  could go at noon do you think that would obviate the difficulties of my  employees? Would it prevent them from converting packing-cases into  lunch rooms?\"    \"You mean a big room with tables and chairs where the men could go and  eat their lunch, Father?\"    \"Something of the sort. Perhaps there could be magazines and books  there, too.\"    \"Hurrah! It's a splendid plan. When will you do it, Father?\" cried  Peter.    \"I didn't say I was going to do it at all. I merely asked you to find  out your friend Strong's opinion. Do you know, some of Strong's ideas  are not so bad. Ask him if a room such as I describe would be as  satisfactory to him as the packing-box lunch room from which he and his  friend Jackson were to-day ejected.\"    \"Of course Strong will like it!\"    \"I think I will give the orders, then. That vacant floor may as well be  used for this purpose as any other. We shall not want it at present, and  if we ever need more room we must devise some other way. I've a fancy,  somehow, to call the new venture the Strong Reading-Room.\"    Peter started to speak.    \"Purely as a joke, you know,\" went on Mr. Coddington, waving his hand.  \"Just as a reminder to Strong how very near he came to losing his  position.\"    Mr. Coddington glanced up humorously; then he chuckled and so did  Peter.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IX    PETER AIDS IN A SURPRISE AND RECEIVES ONE      All the next few months corps of men worked secretly transforming into a  reading-room the great vacant place, which, on that memorable day, Peter  and Nat had appropriated as a lunch room. Carpenters laid the new  floor and stained it; painters tinted the walls a soft green; masons  constructed a hospitable fireplace. One end of the room was furnished  with tiers of book-shelves, tables, chairs, and reading lights; the  other was dotted with a myriad of small tables for the use of those who  wished to lunch at the factories.    Then one Sunday afternoon when everything was completed Peter and his  father made a clandestine trip to the tannery and admitting themselves,  crept up-stairs where Mr. Coddington unlocked the door of the \"forbidden  chamber.\" The whole room glowed with sunshine which flooded the polished  floors and reflected its brightness in the shiny brass andirons adorning  the fireplace.    Peter, who had not seen the place since it was finished, exclaimed with  delight.    \"You are satisfied then, Peter?\" inquired his father, enjoying his  pleasure. \"Do you think there is anything else that your friend Strong  would suggest?\"    The lad looked critically about.    \"Only one thing, and perhaps that is not necessary after all. But  doesn't it seem to you that the space over the fireplace needs a picture  or something? It looks so bare!\"    \"A picture! I had not thought of that. Yes, I see what you mean.\"    \"Just one picture,\" went on Peter. \"Something that will show well from  this end of the room when people come in.\"    \"Yes, it would certainly be a distinct improvement. We'll have a picture  there.\"    Peter raised his eyes shyly to his father's face.    \"I think it would be nice,\" he said, \"to have a picture of you.\"    \"A picture of me! Pooh, pooh! Nonsense! The men see me often enough--too  often, I fancy. Remember they do not care for me as you do. No, indeed!  I could not think of sticking my own portrait up in my tanneries. I  shouldn't want to see it myself.\"    \"I don't suppose you would,\" admitted Peter, reluctantly.    \"But we'll have a picture there all the same, Peter. Will you trust me  to select it?\"    \"Of course I will. Just get something to do with sheep or  horses--something that the men will enjoy and understand.\"    Mr. Coddington smiled down into the eager face.    \"I guess I can find a picture the men will like; it may take a little  while, though, to get just the right thing. Had we better throw open the  room now without it, or wait until everything is complete?\"    \"Oh, wait! Wait!\" was Peter's plea. \"Do not open it until everything is  done! We do not need to use the place at this season of the year anyway,  because the weather is now so warm that every one goes to the park at  noon. The secret can be kept until fall, can't it?\"    \"Yes, indeed. Nobody, with the exception of Mr. Tyler and the workmen,  knows about the room; and they are pledged not to tell.\"    Accordingly the shades of the new reading-room were lowered, it was  securely locked,"]]]
