There the youngsters perched,  without seeming to feel any discomfort from their strained position. And  what a racket they made when the parent birds returned from an excursion  to distant meadows and lawns, with bill-some tidbits! They were  certainly a hungry lot of bairns. When I waded out into the shallow  water toward their rushy home, the old birds became quite uneasy,  circling about above me like the red-wings, and uttering a harsh  blackbird \"chack,\" varied at intervals by a loud, and not unmusical,  chirp.    [Illustration: _Yellow-Headed Blackbirds_    \"_There the youngsters perched_\"]    You should see the nest of the yellow-head. It is really a fine  structure, showing no small amount of artistic skill--a plaited cup,  looking almost as if it had been woven by human hands, the rushes of the  rim and sides folding the supporting reeds in their loops. Thus the nest  and its reedy pillars are firmly bound together. I waded out to a clump  of rushes and found one nest with three eggs in its softly felted  cup--the promise, no doubt, of a belated, or possibly a second, brood.    This mountain lake was also the abode of a number of species of ducks,  not all of which could be identified, on account of the distance they  constantly put between themselves and the observer. Flocks of them  floated like light, feathered craft upon the silvery bosom of the lake,  now pursuing one another, now drifting lazily, now diving, and anon  playing many attractive gambols.    One of the most curious ducks I have ever seen was the ruddy duck,  called in the scientific manuals _Erismatura rubida_. As I sat on a rock  on the shore, watching the aquatic fowl, one of the male ruddy ducks,  accompanied by three or four females, swam out from the reeds into an  open space where I could see him plainly with my field-glass. A  beautiful picture he presented, as he glided proudly about on the water,  surrounded by his devoted harem. Imagine, if you can, how regal he must  have appeared--his broad, flat bill, light blue, widening out at the  commissure, and seeming to shade off into the large white cheeks, which  looked like snowy puffballs on the sides of his head; his crown, black  and tapering; his neck, back, and sides, a rich, glossy brownish-red;  his lower parts, \"silky, silvery white, 'watered' with dusky, yielding,  gray undulations\"; and his wing-coverts and jauntily perked-up tail,  black. If that was not a picture worthy of an artist's brush I have  never seen one in the outdoor world.    No less quaint was his conduct. That he was proud and self-conscious, no  one seeing him could doubt; and it was just as plain from his  consequential mien, that he was posing before his train of plainly clad  wives, who, no doubt, looked upon him as the greatest \"catch\" of the  lake. Unlike most ducks, in swimming this haughty major carries his head  erect, and even bent backward at a sharp angle; and his short tail is  cocked up and bent forward, so that his glossy back forms a graceful  half-circle or more, and does not slope downward, as do the backs of  most ducks on the water.    Of all the odd gestures, this fellow's carried off the palm. He would  draw his head up and back, then thrust it forward a few inches, extend  his blue bill in a horizontal line, and at the same time emit a low,  coarse squawk that I could barely hear. Oddly enough, all the females,  staid as they were, imitated their liege lord's deportment. It was their  way of protesting against my ill-bred intrusion into their demesne.    Presently a second male came out into the open space, accompanied by a  retinue of wives, and then a third emerged, similarly attended. With  this there was a challenging among the rivals that was interesting to  witness; they fairly strutted about on the water, now advancing, now  retreating, and occasionally almost, but never quite, closing in combat.  Sometimes one would pursue another for a rod or more, in a swift rush  that would make the spray fly and cut a swath on the smooth bosom of  the lake.    Several coots now appeared on the scene. Between them and the ruddy  ducks there seemed to be a feud of more or less intensity, each being on  the offensive or the defensive as the exigencies of naval warfare  demanded. Once I was moved to laughter as a coot made a fierce dash  toward one of the ducks, and was almost upon her, and I thought she was  destined to receive a severe trouncing, when she suddenly dodged her  pursuer by diving. He just as suddenly gave up the chase, looking as if  it were a case of \"sour grapes,\" anyway.    After watching the antics of these birds for a long time, I turned my  attention to another pretty scene,--a pair of coots leading their family  of eight or ten little ones out into the clear area from their  hiding-place among the reeds, presenting a picture of unruffled domestic  bliss. How sweet and innocent the little coots were! Instead of the  black heads and necks of their parents, and the white bills and frontal  bones, these parts were tinted with red, which appeared quite bright and  gauze-like in the sunshine.    The process of feeding the juvenile birds was interesting. The parents  would swim about, then suddenly dip their heads into the water, or else  dive clear under, coming up with slugs in their bills. Turning to the  youngsters, which were always close upon their heels--or perhaps I  would better say their tails--they would hold out their bills, when the  little ones would swim up and pick off the toothsome morsel. It must not  be supposed that the bantlings opened their mouths, as most young birds  do, to receive the tidbits. No, indeed! That is not coot vogue. The  little ones picked the insects from the sides of the papa's or mamma's  beak, turning their own little heads cunningly to one side as they  helped themselves to their luncheon.    The other waterfowl of the lake acted in an ordinary way, and therefore  need no description. It was strange, however, that this was the only  lake seen in all my Rocky Mountain touring where I found waterfowl. At  Seven Lakes, Moraine Lake, and others in the vicinity of Pike's Peak,  not a duck, crane, or coot was to be seen; and the same was true of  Cottonwood Lake, twelve miles from Buena Vista, right in the heart of  the rugged mountains.    [Illustration: \"_From their place among the reeds_\"]    Two facts may account for the abundance of birds at the little lake near  Buena Vista; first, here they were protected from gunners and pot  hunters by the owner, whose residence commanded a full view of the whole  area; and, second, large spaces of the upper end of the lake was thickly  grown with flags and rushes, which were cut off from the shore by a  watery space of considerable breadth. In this place these birds found  coverts from enemies and suitable sites for their nests.          A BIRD MISCELLANY      It shall be my purpose in this chapter to describe with more or less  fulness a number of Rocky Mountain birds which have either not been  mentioned in previous chapters or have received only casual attention.    On reaching Colorado one is surprised to find none of our common blue  jays which are so abundant in the Eastern and Middle States. In my  numerous Rocky Mountain jaunts not one was seen. Yet this region does  not need to go begging for jays, only they belong to different groups of  the _Garrulinae_ subfamily. The most abundant and conspicuous of these  western forms are the long-crested jays, so called on account of the  long tuft of black feathers adorning the occiput. This distinguishing  mark is not like the firm pyramidal crest of the eastern jay, but is  longer and narrower, and so flexible that it sways back and forth as the  bird flits from branch to branch or takes a hop-skip-and-jump over the  ground. Its owner can raise and lower it at will.    The forehead of this jay is prettily sprinkled with white; his head and  neck are black, in decided contrast with the umber-brown of the back;  his rump and belly are pale blue, and his wings and tail are rich  indigo-blue, somewhat iridescent and widely barred with black. Thus it  will be seen that he has quite a different costume from that of our  eastern jay, with his gaudy trimmings of white and black and purplish  blue. The westerner cannot boast of _cristata's_ dressy black collar,  but otherwise he is more richly attired, although he may not be quite so  showy.    The long-crested jays have a wide range among the mountains, breeding  from the base of the foothills to the timber-line, although their nests  are not commonly found below an altitude of seven thousand feet. In many  places from nine to eleven thousand feet up the acclivities of the  mountains they were seen flitting among the pines or the quaking asps.  Like their eastern relatives, some individuals seem to prefer the  society of man, dwelling in the villages or in the vicinity of country  homes, while others choose the most secluded and solitary localities for  their habitat. The fact is, I rarely made an excursion anywhere without  sooner or later discovering that these jays had pre-empted the place for  feeding or breeding purposes, sometimes with loud objurgations bidding  me be gone, and at other times making no to-do whatever over my  intrusion. Perhaps the proximity or remoteness of their nests was the  chief cause of this variableness in their behavior.    A pretty picture is one of these jays mounting from branch to branch  around the stem of a pine tree, from the lower limbs to the top, as if  he were ascending a spiral staircase. This seems to be one of their  regulation habits when they find themselves under inspection.

The number and ingenuity of his  inventions, the brilliant discoveries which he made in the heavens, and  the depth and beauty of his researches respecting the laws of motion,  have gained him the admiration of every succeeding age, and have placed  him next to Newton in the lists of original and inventive genius. To  this high rank he was doubtless elevated by the inductive processes  which he followed in all his inquiries. Under the sure guidance of  observation and experiment, he advanced to general laws; and if Bacon  had never lived, the student of nature Would have found, in the writings  and labours of Galileo, not only the boasted principles of the inductive  philosophy, but also their practical application to the highest efforts  of invention and discovery.

He was born on the 14th December 1546, at Knudstorp,  the estate of his ancestors, which is situated near Helsingborg, in  Scania, and was the eldest son and the second child of a family of five  sons and five daughters. His father, Otto Brahe, who was descended from  a noble Swedish family, was in such straitened circumstances, that he  resolved to educate his sons for the military profession; but Tycho  seems to have disliked the choice that was made for him; and his next  brother, Steno, who appears to have had a similar feeling, exchanged the  sword for the more peaceful occupation of Privy Councillor to the King.  The rest of his brothers, though of senatorial rank, do not seem to have  extended the renown of their family; but their youngest sister, Sophia,  is represented as an accomplished mathematician, and is said to have  devoted her mind to astronomy as well as to the astrological reveries of  the age.    George Brahe, the brother of Otto, having no children of his own,  resolved to adopt and to educate one of his nephews. On the birth of  Tycho, accordingly, he was desirous of having him placed under his  wife's care; but his parents could not be prevailed upon to part with  their child till after the birth of Steno, their second son.    Having been instructed in reading and writing under proper masters,  Tycho began the study of Latin in his seventh year; and, in opposition  to his father's views, he prosecuted it for five years under private  teachers, from whom he received also occasional instruction in poetry  and the belles lettres.    In April 1559, about three years after his father's death, Tycho was  sent to the University of Copenhagen, to study rhetoric and philosophy,  with the view of preparing for the study of the law, and qualifying  himself for some of those political offices which his rank entitled him  to expect. In this situation he contracted no fondness for any  particular study; but after he had been sixteen months at college, an  event occurred which directed all the powers of his mind to the science  of astronomy. The attention of the public had been long fixed on a great  eclipse of the sun, which was to happen on the 21st August 1560; and as  in those days a phenomenon of this kind was linked with the destinies of  nations as well as of individuals, the interest which it excited was as  intense as it was general. Tycho watched its arrival with peculiar  anxiety. He read the astrological diaries of the day, in which its  phases and its consequences were described; and when he saw the sun  darkened at the very moment that had been predicted, and to the very  extent that had been delineated, he resolved to make himself master of a  science which was capable of predicting future events, and especially  that branch of it which connected these events with the fortunes and  destinies of man. With this view he purchased the _Tabulae Bergenses_,  calculated by John Stadius, and began with ardour the study of the  planetary motions.    When Tycho had completed his course at Copenhagen, he was sent, in  February 1562, under the charge of a tutor to study jurisprudence at  Leipsic. Astronomy, however, engrossed all his thoughts; and he had no  sooner escaped from the daily surveillance of his master, than he rushed  with headlong impetuosity into his favourite pursuits. With his pocket  money he purchased astronomical books, which he read in secret; and by  means of a celestial globe, the size of his fist, he made himself  acquainted with the stars, and followed them night after night through  the heavens, when sleep had lulled the vigilance of his preceptor. By  means of the Ephemerides of Stadius, he learned to distinguish the  planets, and to trace them through their direct and retrograde  movements; and having obtained the Alphonsine and Prutenic Tables, and  compared his own calculations and observations with those of Stadius, he  observed great differences in the results, and from that moment he seems  to have conceived the design of devoting his life to the accurate  construction of tables, which he justly regarded as the basis of  astronomy.    With this view, he applied himself secretly to the study of arithmetic  and geometry; and, without the assistance of a master, he acquired that  mathematical knowledge which enabled him to realise these early  aspirations. His ardour for astronomy was still farther inflamed, and  the resolution which it inspired still farther strengthened, by the  great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, which took place in August  1563. The calculated time of this phenomenon differed considerably from  the true time which was observed; and in determining the instant of  conjunction Tycho felt in the strongest manner the imperfection of the  instruments which he used. For this purpose he employed a sort of  compass, one leg of which was directed to one planet and the second to  the other planet or fixed star; and, by measuring the angular opening  between them, he determined the distance of the two celestial bodies. By  this rude contrivance he found that the Alphonsine Tables erred a whole  month in the time of conjunction, while the Copernican ones were at  least several days in error. To this celebrated conjunction Tycho  ascribed the great plague which in subsequent years desolated Europe,  because it took place in the beginning of _Leo_, and not far from the  nebulous stars of _Cancer_, two of the zodiacal signs which are reckoned  by Ptolemy \"suffocating and pestilent!\"    There dwelt at this time at Leipsic an ingenious artisan named  Scultetus, who was employed by Homelius, the professor of mathematics in  that city, to assist him in the construction of his instruments. Having  become acquainted with this young man, Tycho put into his hand a wooden  radius, such as was recommended by Gemma Frisius, for the purpose of  having it divided in the manner adopted by Homelius; and with this  improved instrument he made a great number of astronomical observations  out of his window, without ever exciting the suspicions of his tutor.    Having spent three years at Leipsic, he was about to make the tour of  Germany, when, in consequence of his uncle's death, he was summoned to  his native country to inherit the fortune which had been left him. He  accordingly quitted Leipsic about the middle of May 1565, and after  having arranged his domestic concerns in Denmark, he continued his  astronomical observations with the radius constructed for him by  Scultetus. The ardour with which he pursued his studies gave great  umbrage to his friends as well as to his relations. He was reproached  for having abandoned the profession of the law; his astronomical  observations were ridiculed as not only useless but degrading, and,  among his numerous connexions, his maternal uncle, Steno Bille, was the  only one who applauded him for following the bent of his genius. Under  these uncomfortable circumstances he resolved to quit his country, and  pay a visit to the most interesting cities of Germany.    At Wittemberg, where he arrived in April 1566, he resumed his  astronomical observations; but, in consequence of the plague having  broken out in that city, he removed to Rostoch in the following autumn.  Here an accident occurred which had nearly deprived him of his life. On  the 10th December he was invited to a wedding feast; and, among other  guests, there was present a noble countryman of his own, Manderupius  Pasbergius. Some difference having arisen between them on this occasion,  they parted with feelings of mutual displeasure. On the 27th of the same  month they met again at some festive games, and having revived their  former quarrel, they agreed to settle their differences by the sword.  They accordingly met at 7 o'clock in the evening of the 29th, and fought  in total darkness. In this blind combat, Manderupius cut off the whole  of the front of Tycho's nose, and it was fortunate for astronomy that  his more valuable organs were defended by so faithful an outpost.
