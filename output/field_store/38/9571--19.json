Is  there anything I can do for you--anything you'd like to have? If it's  in reason I'll get it for you, just to pay my debt.\"    Tommy stared at Miss Octavia with a sudden hopeful inspiration. \"Oh,  Miss Octavia,\" he cried eagerly, \"will you buy a doll and give it to  me?\"    \"Well, for the land's sake!\" ejaculated Miss Octavia, unable to  believe her ears. \"A doll! What on earth do you want of a doll?\"    \"It's for Bessie,\" said Tommy eagerly. \"You see, it's this way.\"    Then Tommy told Miss Octavia the whole story. Miss Octavia listened  silently, sometimes nodding her head. When he had finished she went  out of the room and soon returned, bringing with her the very  identical doll that had been in Mr. Blacklock's window.    \"I guess this is the doll,\" she said. \"I bought it to give to a small  niece of mine, but I can get another for her. You may take this to  Bessie.\"    It would be of no use to try to describe Bessie's joy when Tommy  rushed in and put Roselle Geraldine in her arms with a breathless  account of the wonderful story. But from that moment Bessie began to  pick up again, and soon she was better than she had ever been and the  happiest little lassie in Arundel.    When a week had passed, Miss Octavia again called Tommy in; Tommy  went more willingly this time. He had begun to like Miss Octavia.    That lady looked him over sharply and somewhat dubiously. He was  certainly very ragged and unkempt. But Miss Octavia saw what she had  never noticed before--that Tommy's eyes were bright and frank, that  Tommy's chin was a good chin, and that Tommy's smile had something  very pleasant about it.    \"You're fond of flowers, aren't you, Tommy?\" she asked.    \"You bet,\" was Tommy's inelegant but heartfelt answer.    \"Well,\" said Miss Octavia slowly, \"I have a brother down at Chelton  who is a florist. He wants a boy of your age to do handy jobs and run  errands about his establishment, and he wants one who is fond of  flowers and would like to learn the business. He asked me to recommend  him one, and I promised to look out for a suitable boy. Would you like  the place, Tommy? And will you promise to be a very good boy and learn  to be respectable if I ask my brother to give you a trial and a chance  to make something of yourself?\"    \"Oh, Miss Octavia!\" gasped Tommy. He wondered if he were simply having  a beautiful dream.    But it was no dream. And it was all arranged later on. No one rejoiced  more heartily in Tommy's success than Bessie.    \"But I'll miss you dreadfully, Tommy,\" she said wistfully.    \"Oh, I'll be home every Saturday night, and we'll have Sunday  together, except when I've got to go to Sunday school. 'Cause Miss  Octavia says I must,\" said Tommy comfortingly. \"And the rest of the  time you'll have Roselle Geraldine.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said Bessie, giving the blue-silk doll a fond kiss,  \"and she's just lovely. But she ain't as nice as you, Tommy, for all.\"    Then was Tommy's cup of happiness full.          Charlotte's Ladies      Just as soon as dinner was over at the asylum, Charlotte sped away to  the gap in the fence--the northwest corner gap. There was a gap in the  southeast corner, too--the asylum fence was in a rather poor  condition--but the southeast gap was interesting only after tea, and  it was never at any time quite as interesting as the northwest gap.    Charlotte ran as fast as her legs could carry her, for she did not  want any of the other orphans to see her. As a rule, Charlotte liked  the company of the other orphans and was a favourite with them. But,  somehow, she did not want them to know about the gaps. She was sure  they would not understand.    Charlotte had discovered the gaps only a week before. They had not  been there in the autumn, but the snowdrifts had lain heavily against  the fence all winter, and one spring day when Charlotte was creeping  through the shrubbery in the northwest corner in search of the little  yellow daffodils that always grew there in spring, she found a  delightful space where a board had fallen off, whence she could look  out on a bit of woodsy road with a little footpath winding along by  the fence under the widespreading boughs of the asylum trees.  Charlotte felt a wild impulse to slip out and run fast and far down  that lovely, sunny, tempting, fenceless road. But that would have been  wrong, for it was against the asylum rules, and Charlotte, though she  hated most of the asylum rules with all her heart, never disobeyed or  broke them. So she subdued the vagrant longing with a sigh and sat  down among the daffodils to peer wistfully out of the gap and feast  her eyes on this glimpse of a world where there were no brick walls  and prim walks and never-varying rules.    Then, as Charlotte watched, the Pretty Lady with the Blue Eyes came  along the footpath. Charlotte had never seen her before and hadn't the  slightest idea in the world who she was, but that was what she called  her as soon as she saw her. The lady was so pretty, with lovely blue  eyes that were very sad, although somehow as you looked at them you  felt that they ought to be laughing, merry eyes instead. At least  Charlotte thought so and wished at once that she knew how to make them  laugh. Besides, the Lady had lovely golden hair and the most beautiful  pink cheeks, and Charlotte, who had mouse-coloured hair and any number  of freckles, had an unbounded admiration for golden locks and roseleaf  complexions. The Lady was dressed in black, which Charlotte didn't  like, principally because the matron of the asylum wore black and  Charlotte didn't--exactly--like the matron.    When the Pretty Lady with the Blue Eyes had gone by, Charlotte drew a  long breath.    \"If I could pick out a mother I'd pick out one that looked just like  her,\" she said.    Nice things sometimes happen close together, even in an orphan asylum,  and that very evening Charlotte discovered the southeast gap and found  herself peering into the most beautiful garden you could imagine, a  garden where daffodils and tulips grew in great ribbon-like beds, and  there were hedges of white and purple lilacs, and winding paths under  blossoming trees. It was such a garden as Charlotte had pictured in  happy dreams and never expected to see in real life. And yet here it  had been all the time, divided from her only by a high board fence.    \"I wouldn't have s'posed there could be such a lovely place so near an  orphan asylum,\" mused Charlotte. \"It's the very loveliest place I ever  saw. Oh, I do wish I could go and walk in it. Well, I do declare! If  there isn't a lady in it, too!\"    Sure enough, there was a lady, helping an unruly young vine to run in  the way it should go over a little arbour. Charlotte instantly named  her the Tall Lady with the Black Eyes. She was not nearly so young or  so pretty as the Lady with the Blue Eyes, but she looked very kind and  jolly.    I'd like her for an aunt, reflected Charlotte. Not for a mother--oh,  no, not for a mother, but for an aunt. I know she'd make a splendid  aunt. And, oh, just look at her cat!    Charlotte looked at the cat with all her might and main. She loved  cats, but cats were not allowed in an orphan asylum, although  Charlotte sometimes wondered if there were no orphan kittens in the  world which would be appropriate for such an institution.    The Tall Lady's cat was so big and furry, with a splendid tail and  elegant stripes. A Very Handsome Cat, Charlotte called him mentally,  seeing the capitals as plainly as if they had been printed out.  Charlotte's fingers tingled to stroke his glossy coat, but she folded  them sternly together.    \"You know you can't,\" she said to herself reproachfully, \"so what is  the use of wanting to, Charlotte Turner? You ought to be thankful just  to see the garden and the Very Handsome Cat.\"    Charlotte watched the Tall Lady and the Cat until they went away into  a fine, big house further up the garden, then she sighed and went back  through the cherry trees to the asylum playground, where the other  orphans were playing games. But, somehow, games had lost their flavour  compared with those fascinating gaps.    It did not take Charlotte long to discover that the Pretty Lady always  walked past the northwest gap about one o'clock every day and never at  any other time--at least at no other time when Charlotte was free to  watch her; and that the Tall Lady was almost always in her garden at  five in the afternoon, accompanied by the Very Handsome Cat, pruning  and trimming some of her flowers. Charlotte never missed being at the  gaps at the proper times, if she could possibly manage it, and her  heart was full of dreams about her two Ladies. But the other orphans  thought all the fun had gone out of her, and the matron noticed her  absent-mindedness and dosed her with sulphur and molasses for it.  Charlotte took the dose meekly, as she took everything else. It was  all part and parcel with being an orphan in an asylum.    \"But if the Pretty Lady with the Blue Eyes was my mother, she wouldn't  make me swallow such dreadful stuff,\" sighed Charlotte. \"I don't  believe even the Tall Lady with the Black Eyes would--though perhaps  she might, aunts not being quite as good as mothers.\"    \"Do you know,\" said Maggie Brunt, coming up to Charlotte at this  moment, \"that Lizzie Parker is going to be adopted? A lady is going to  adopt her.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Charlotte breathlessly. An adoption was always a wonderful  event in the asylum, as well as a somewhat rare one. \"Oh, how  splendid!\"    \"Yes, isn't it?\" said Maggie enviously. \"She picked out Lizzie because  she was pretty and had curls. I don't think it is fair.\"    Charlotte sighed. \"Nobody will ever want to adopt me, because I've  mousy hair and freckles,\" she said. \"But somebody may want you some  day, Maggie. You have such lovely black hair.\"    \"But it isn't curly,\" said Maggie"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24884"],[0,"Commercial Geography (#16)"],[1,"combing, and are  therefore called \"combing\" wools. The cotswold, cheviot, and most of the  wools of the British Isles are of this kind; indeed, in fairly moist  lowland regions such as Canada and the United States, there is a  tendency toward the development of a long-staple product. The English  long-staple wools are largely made into worsted cloth, the Scotch  cheviot into tweeds, and the French into the best dress cloth.    If the fibres are materially less than four inches in length, the  product is classed as a short-staple or \"carding\" wool. By far the  greater part of the wool of the United States, Canada, and Europe is of  this class. It is disposed of according to its fineness or fitness for  special purposes, the greater part being made into cloths for the medium  grades of men's clothing.    The finest and softest wool as a rule is grown in arid, plateau regions,  and of this kind of staple the merino is an example. The fibres are fine  as silk, and the goods made from them are softer. The Mission wool of  California is the product of merino sheep, and, indeed, the conditions  of climate in southern California and Australia are such as to produce  the best merino wool. The famous Electoral wool of Saxony is a merino,  the sheep having been introduced into that country from Spain about  three hundred years ago. The merino wools, as a rule, are used in the  most highly finished dress and fancy goods.    The coarse-staple wools are very largely used for American carpets,  coarse blankets, and certain kinds of heavy outer clothing. The Russian  Donskoi wool, some of the Argentine fleeces, such as the Cordoban, and  many of those grown in wet lowlands are very coarse and harsh. The  quality is due more to climatic conditions and food than to the species  of sheep; indeed, sheep that in other regions produce a fine wool, when  introduced to this locality, after a few generations produce coarse  wool.    [Illustration: SHEEP FEEDING ON ALFALFA]    [Illustration: SHEEP RANGE, UTAH]    [Illustration: SHEEP IN FEEDING YARD    THE WOOL-GROWING INDUSTRY]    The rug wools grown in Persia, Turkestan, Turkey in Asia, and the  Caucasus Mountains are also characteristic. They vary in fineness, and  because they do not readily felt they are the best in the world for rug  stock. The \"pile\" or surface of the rug remains elastic and stands  upright even after a hundred years of wear. This quality is due mainly  to conditions of climate and soil.    [Illustration: WOOL PRODUCTION]    In some instances the wool is obtained by a daily combing of the  half-grown lambs. This process, however, is employed in the rug-making  districts only; in general, the fleeces are clipped either with shears  or machine clippers. In the United States the latter are generally  employed, and but little attempt is made either to sort the fleeces or  to separate the various qualities of wool in the same fleece.    The raw wool always contains foreign matter such as burs and dirt; it is  also saturated with a natural oil which prevents felting. The oil,  commonly called \"grease,\" or \"yolk,\" is an important article of  commerce; under the name of \"lanolin\" (_adeps lanae_) it is used in  medicine and pharmacy as a basis for ointments.    The world's yearly clip is a little more than two and one-half billion  pounds, of which the United States produces about one-eighth. In Europe  and the United States, owing to the increasing value of the land, the  area of production is decreasing; in Australia, South Africa, and  Argentina, where land is cheap, it is increasing. From these three  regions wool is exported; most European countries and the United States  buy it. In the latter country the consumption is about six pounds for  each person.    [Illustration: WOOL]    The wools of the Mediterranean countries--France, Spain, Italy, Algiers,  Egypt, etc.--are the best for fine cloths; those of central Asia for  rugs and shawls; the others are used mainly in medium and low grade  textiles.    =Other Wools.=--The Angora goat, originally grown in Anatolia (Asia  Minor), and the Iran States (Persia, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan),  furnishes a beautiful white wool, commercially known as \"mohair.\" Smyrna  is an important market for it, and England is the chief buyer. The  Angora goat has been introduced into South Africa and California, where  it is successfully grown. From the former country there is a large  export of mohair.    Cashmere wool is a fine, downy undercovering, obtained by combing the  fleece of a goat native to the Kashmir Valley in India. A single animal  yields scarcely more than an ounce or two, and the best product is worth  about its weight in gold. It is used in the manufacture of the famous  Cashmere shawls, which are sold at prices varying from five hundred to  five thousand dollars. They are made in Persia and India.    Llama and alpaca wool are fine textile obtained from animals of the  camel kind native to South America. The wool is either black or brown in  color. A considerable part is used for native-made articles, such as  saddle-blankets, etc., but much of it is exported to England.    Most of the \"camel's hair\" of commerce was originally worn by goats,  being called by its commercial name because of a similarity in texture  to that of the camel's hair. The camel of Turkestan, however, furnishes  a silky textile that is much used. The brown wool often found in Hamadan  rugs is natural camel's hair, and a considerable amount mixed with  sheep's wool is used in certain textiles. The camel's hair of China is  made into artists' brushes.    =Silk.=--The silk of commerce is the fibre spun by the larvae or  caterpillars of a moth, _Bombyx mori_, as they enter the chrysalis stage  of existence. The silk-growing industry includes the care and feeding of  the insect in all its stages. The leaves of the white mulberry-tree  (_morus alba_) are the natural food of the insect, and silk-growing  cannot be carried on in regions where this tree does not thrive. Not all  areas that produce the mulberry-tree, however, will also grow the  silk-worm; the latter cannot exist in regions having very cold winters,  and therefore the industry is restricted by climate.    The moth, shortly after emerging from the chrysalis stage, lays from two  or three hundred to seven hundred eggs. These are \"hardy\"--that is, they  will remain fertile for a long time if kept in a cool, dry place;  moisture will cause them to putrify, and heat to germinate. If well  protected, they may be transported for distances.    In rearing the silk-worm, as soon as the latter is hatched, it is placed  on mulberry-leaves, and for five weeks it does nothing but eat, in that  time consuming many times its weight of food.[33] Then it begins to spin  the material that forms its chrysalis case or cocoon. The outer part of  the case consists of a tough envelope not unlike coarse tissue-paper;  the inner part is a fine thread about one thousand feet long that has  been wound around the body of the worm. This thread or filament is the  basis of the silk textile industry.    [Illustration: _Copyright, 1898, by Nature Study Pub. Co._    SILK INDUSTRY      1. Silkworm Eggs    2. Fourth-stage Worm    3.

Manufactured Silk]    [Illustration: SILK PRODUCING REGIONS]    At the proper time the cocoons are gathered and, if immediately to be  used, are plunged into hot water. This not only kills the chrysalids but  softens the cocoons as well, so that the outer cases may be removed. The  cases removed, the rest of the cocoon is soaked in warm water until the  gummy matter is softened and the fibres are free enough to be reeled. In  the latter process the ends of a number of cocoons, varying from five to  twenty, are caught and loosely twisted into a single strand. The silk  thus prepared forms the \"raw silk\" of commerce. Sometimes a number of  strands of raw silk are twisted into a coarse thread, thereby forming  \"thrown silk.\" For convenience in handling, both raw and thrown silk  are made into large skeins called hanks, and most of the silk product is  exported in this form.    A given quantity of cocoons yields scarcely more than one-tenth its  weight in good raw silk. The remaining part, consisting of broken fibres  and cases, is shredded and spun into silk thread of inferior quality.  This material, commonly called \"husks\" or \"knubs,\" forms an important  item in silk manufacture, and much of it is exported to Europe and  America.    [Illustration: SILK PRODUCTION]    According to traditions, not wholly trustworthy, eggs of the silk-worm  were smuggled to India in the head-dress of a Chinese princess. Thence  sericulture slowly made its way westward to Persia, Asia Minor, and the  Mediterranean countries. Wild silk, a coarse but strong product, is  grown in many of these countries, but mainly in China, where it forms an  important export. The Chinese product is commercially known as \"tussar\"  silk. Of the product of raw silk, about thirty-five million pounds,  China yields about two-fifths, Japan and Italy each one-fifth. The  remainder is grown in the Levant, Spain, and France.    Most of the raw silk of China is exported from Shanghai and Canton; that  of Japan is shipped mainly from Yokohama. Among European countries Italy  is the first producer of raw silk, and France the chief manufacturer.  By the operation of a heavy tariff a considerable manufacture of silk  textiles has grown up in the United States. New York City and Paterson,  N.J., are the chief centres of the industry.    The southern part of the United States offers an ideal locality for  sericulture. Various attempts at silk-worm breeding have failed from  lack of training, but not on account of geographic conditions.    =Flax.=--The flax of commerce, the basis of linen cloth, is the bast or  inner bark-fibre of"]]]
