[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#16)"],[1,"\" said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a  little white slug.    \"Well! May I be--skinned!\" said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick  as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a  little boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just  then; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: \"Isn't there any place  for seals to go where men don't ever come?\"    \"Go and find out,\" said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. \"Run away. We're  busy here.\"    Kotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could:  \"Clam-eater! Clam-eater!\" He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in  his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to  be a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies  and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the  Puffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the  cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not  have heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling  and screaming \"Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!\" while Sea Vitch rolled  from side to side grunting and coughing.    \"Now will you tell?\" said Kotick, all out of breath.    \"Go and ask Sea Cow,\" said Sea Vitch. \"If he is living still, he'll be  able to tell you.\"    \"How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?\" said Kotick, sheering off.    \"He's the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,\" screamed a  Burgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch's nose. \"Uglier, and with  worse manners! Stareek!\"    Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he  found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover  a quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven  the holluschickie--it was part of the day's work--and that if he did not  like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds.  But none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the  difference between him and his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white  seal.    \"What you must do,\" said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son's  adventures, \"is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have  a nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another  five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.\" Even gentle  Matkah, his mother, said: \"You will never be able to stop the killing.  Go and play in the sea, Kotick.\" And Kotick went off and danced the  Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart.    That autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone  because of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow,  if there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet  island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not  get at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to  the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day  and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly  escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and  the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up  and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted  scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow  very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island  that he could fancy.    If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play  on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down  blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that  seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew  that where men had come once they would come again.    He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that  Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick  went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked  black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as  he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once  been a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he  visited.    Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five  seasons exploring, with a four months' rest each year at Novastoshnah,  when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary  islands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator,  where he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands,  the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough's Island,  Bouvet's Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island  south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea  told him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a  time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of  miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that  was when he was coming back from Gough's Island), he found a few hundred  mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.    That nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his  own beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of  green trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick  caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. \"Now,\" said Kotick,  \"I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens  with the holluschickie I shall not care.\"    The old seal said, \"Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of  Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand  there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come  out of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old,  and I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.\"    And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, \"I am the  only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the  only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.\"    This cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that  summer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for  he was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly  white mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his  father. \"Give me another season,\" he said. \"Remember, Mother, it is  always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.\"    Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put  off marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with  her all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last  exploration. This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the  trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred  pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till  he was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the  hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the  coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently  bumped on a weed-bed, he said, \"Hm, tide's running strong tonight,\" and  turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched. Then  he jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal  water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.    \"By the Great Combers of Magellan!\" he said, beneath his mustache. \"Who  in the Deep Sea are these people?\"    They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish,  squid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between  twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a  shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet  leather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw,  and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they  weren't grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front  flippers as a fat man waves his arm.    \"Ahem!\" said Kotick. \"Good sport, gentlemen?\" The big things answered by  bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began  feeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces  that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with  a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into  their mouths and chumped solemnly.    \"Messy style of feeding, that,\" said Kotick. They bowed again, and  Kotick began to lose his temper. \"Very good,\" he said. \"If you do happen  to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn't show off so. I  see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.\" The split  lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did  not speak.    \"Well!\" said Kotick. \"You're the only people I've ever met uglier than  Sea Vitch--and with worse manners.\"    Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed  to him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled  backward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.    The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed,  and Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked  up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as  human beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot  talk. He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven,  and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even  to his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his  foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what  answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.    By daylight Kotick's mane was standing on end and his temper was gone  where the dead crabs go.

We may all be beautiful. Though our forms may be uncomely and our  features not the prettiest, our spirits may be beautiful. And this inward  beauty always shines through. A beautiful heart will flash out in the eye.  A lovely soul will glow in the face. A sweet spirit will tune the voice,  wreathe the countenance in charms. Oh, there is a power in interior beauty  that melts the hardest heart!    4. WOMAN THE MOST PERFECT TYPE OF BEAUTY.--Woman, by common consent, we  regard as the most perfect type of beauty on earth. To her we ascribe the  highest charms belonging to this wonderful element so profusely mingled in  all God's works. Her form is molded and finished in exquisite delicacy of  perfection. The earth gives us no form more perfect, no features more  symmetrical, no style more chaste, no movements more graceful, no finish  more complete; so that our artists ever have and ever will regard the  woman-form of humanity as the most perfect earthly type of beauty. This  form is most perfect and symmetrical in the youth of womanhood; so that the  youthful woman is earth's queen of beauty. This is true, not only by the  common consent of mankind, but also by the strictest rules of scientific  criticism.    [Illustration: A REJECTED LOVER.]    5. FADELESS BEAUTY.--There cannot be a picture without its bright spots;  and the steady contemplation of what is bright in others, has a reflex  influence upon the beholder. It reproduces what it reflects. Nay, it seems  to leave an impress even upon the countenance. The feature, from having a  dark, sinister aspect, becomes open, serene, and sunny. A countenance so  impressed, has neither the vacant stare of the idiot, nor the crafty,  penetrating look of the basilisk, but the clear, placid aspect of truth and  goodness. The woman {94} who has such a face is beautiful. She has a beauty  which changes not with the features, which fades not with years. It is  beauty of expression. It is the only kind of beauty which can be relied  upon for a permanent influence with the other sex. The violet will soon  cease to smile. Flowers must fade. The love that has nothing but beauty to  sustain it, soon withers away.    6. A PRETTY WOMAN PLEASES THE EYE, a good woman, the heart. The one is a  jewel, the other a treasure. Invincible fidelity, good humor, and  complacency of temper, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the  decay of it invisible. That is true beauty which has not only a substance,  but a spirit; a beauty that we must intimately know to justly appreciate.    7. THE WOMAN YOU LOVE BEST.--Beauty, dear reader, is probably the woman you  love best, but we trust it is the beauty of soul and character, which sits  in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, and will outlive what is  called a fine face.    8. THE WEARING OF ORNAMENTS.--Beauty needs not the foreign aid of ornament,  but is when unadorned adorned the most, is a trite observation; but with a  little qualification it is worthy of general acceptance. Aside from the  dress itself, ornaments should be very sparingly used--at any rate, the  danger lies in over-loading oneself, and not in using too few. A young  girl, and especially one of a light and airy style of beauty, should never  wear gems. A simple flower in her hair or on her bosom is all that good  taste will permit. When jewels or other ornaments are worn, they should be  placed where you desire the eye of the spectator to rest, leaving the parts  to which you do not want attention called as plain and negative as  possible. There is no surer sign of vulgarity than a profusion of heavy  jewelry carried about upon the person.    [Illustration]    {95}    Sensible Helps to Beauty.    [Illustration]    1. FOR SCRAWNY NECK.--Take off your tight collars, feather boas and such  heating things. Wash neck and chest with hot water, then rub in sweet oil  all that you can work in. Apply this every night before you retire and  leave the skin damp with it while you sleep.    2. FOR RED HANDS.--Keep your feet warm by soaking them often in hot water,  and keep your hands out of the water as much as possible. Rub your hands  with the skin of a lemon and it will whiten them. If your skin will bear  glycerine after you have washed, pour into the palm a little glycerine and  lemon juice mixed, and rub over the hands and wipe off.    3. NECK AND FACE.--Do not bathe the neck and face just before or after  being out of doors. It tends to wrinkle the skin.    4. SCOWLS.--Never allow yourself to scowl, even if the sun be in your eyes.  That scowl will soon leave its trace and no beauty will outlive it. {96}    5. WRINKLED FOREHEAD.--If you wrinkle your forehead when you talk or read,  visit an oculist and have your eyes tested, and then wear glasses to fit  them.    6. OLD LOOKS.--Sometimes your face looks old because it is tired. Then  apply the following wash and it will make you look younger: Put three drops  of ammonia, a little borax, a tablespoonful of bay rum, and a few drops of  camphor into warm water and apply to your face. Avoid getting it into your  eyes.    7. THE BEST COSMETIC.--Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a pint of sweet  milk. Wash the face with it every night and in the morning wash off with  warm rain water. This will produce a very beautiful effect upon the skin.    8. SPOTS ON THE FACE.--Moles and many other discolorations may be removed  from the face by a preparation composed of one part chemically pure  carbolic acid and two parts pure glycerine. Touch the spots with a  camel's-hair pencil, being careful that the preparation does not come in  contact with the adjacent skin. Five minutes after touching, bathe with  soft water and apply a little vaseline. It may be necessary to repeat the  operation, but if persisted in, the blemishes will be entirely removed.    9. WRINKLES.--This prescription is said to cure wrinkles: Take one ounce of  white wax and melt it to a gentle heat. Add two ounces of the juice of lily  bulbs, two ounces of honey, two drams of rose water, and a drop or two of  ottar of roses. Apply twice a day, rubbing the wrinkles the wrong way.  Always use tepid water for washing the face.    10. THE HAIR.--The hair must be kept free from dust or it will fall out.  One of the best things for cleaning it, is a raw egg rubbed into the roots  and then washed out in several waters. The egg furnishes material for the  hair to grow on, while keeping the scalp perfectly clean. Apply once a  month.    11. LOSS OF HAIR.--When through sickness or headache the hair falls out,  the following tonic may be applied with good effect: Use one ounce of  glycerine, one ounce of bay rum, one pint of strong sage tea, and apply  every other night, rubbing well into the scalp.           *       *       *       *       *      {97}    How to Keep the Bloom and Grace of Youth.    THE SECRET OF ITS PRESERVATION.    [Illustration: MRS. WM. MCKINLEY.]    1. The question most often asked by women is regarding the art of  retaining, with advancing years, the bloom and grace of youth. This secret  is not learned through the analysis of chemical compounds, but by a  thorough study of nature's laws peculiar to their sex. It is useless for  women with wrinkled faces, dimmed eyes and blemished skins to seek for  external applications of beautifying balms and lotions to bring the glow of  life and health into the face, and yet there are truths, simple yet  wonderful, whereby the bloom of early life can be restored and retained, as  should be the heritage of all God's children, sending the light of beauty  into every woman's face. The secret:    2. Do not bathe in hard water; soften it with a few drops of ammonia, or a  little borax.    3. Do not bathe the face while it is very warm, and never use very cold  water.    4. Do not attempt to remove dust with cold water; give your face a hot  bath, using plenty of good soap, then give it a thorough rinsing with warm  water.    5. Do not rub your face with a coarse towel.    6. Do not believe you can remove wrinkles by filling in the crevices with  powder. Give your face a Russian bath every night; that is, bathe it with  water so hot that you wonder how you can bear it, and then, a minute after,  with moderately cold water, that will make your face glow with warmth; dry  it with a soft towel.           *       *       *       *       * {98}      Form and Deformity.    [Illustration: MALE. FEMALE.  Showing the Difference in Form and Proportion.]    1. PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES.--Masquerading is a modern accomplishment. Girls  wear tight shoes, burdensome skirts, corsets, etc., all of which prove so  fatal to their health. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, our \"young  ladies\" are sorry specimens of feminality; and palpitators, cosmetics and  all the modern paraphernalia are required to make them appear fresh and  blooming. Man is equally at fault. A devotee to all the absurd devices of  fashion, he practically asserts that \"dress makes the man.\" But physical  deformities are of far less importance than moral imperfections.    2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--It is not possible for human beings to  attain their full stature of humanity, except by loving long and perfectly.  Behold that venerable man! he is mature in judgment, perfect in every  action and expression, and saintly in goodness. You almost worship as you  behold. What rendered him thus perfect? What {99} rounded off his natural  asperities, and moulded up his virtues? Love, mainly. It permeated every  pore, and seasoned every fibre of his being, as could nothing else. Mark  that matronly woman. In the bosom of her family she is more than a queen  and goddess combined. All her looks and actions express the outflowing of  some or all of the human virtues. To know her is to love her. She became  thus perfect, not in a"]]]
