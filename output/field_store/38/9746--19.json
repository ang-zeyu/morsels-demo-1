The rest are variously employed in  clearing fresh land; in dragging brick and timber carts; and a great number  in making a road of a mile long, through the main street, to the governor's  house.]          CHAPTER XI.        Farther Transactions of the Colony in November, 1790.      During the intervals of duty, our greatest source of entertainment now  lay in cultivating the acquaintance of our new friends, the natives. Ever  liberal of communication, no difficulty but of understanding each other  subsisted between us. Inexplicable contradictions arose to bewilder our  researches which no ingenuity could unravel and no credulity reconcile.    Baneelon, from being accustomed to our manners, and understanding a little  English, was the person through whom we wished to prosecute inquiry, but he  had lately become a man of so much dignity and consequence, that it was not  always easy to obtain his company. Clothes had been given to him at various  times, but he did not always condescend to wear them. One day he would  appear in them, and the next day he was to be seen carrying them in a net  slung around his neck. Farther to please him, a brick house of twelve feet  square was built for his use, and for that of such of his countrymen as  might choose to reside in it, on a point of land fixed upon by himself. A  shield, double cased with tin, to ward off the spears of his enemies, was  also presented to him, by the governor.    Elated by these marks of favour, and sensible that his importance with his  countrymen arose in proportion to our patronage of him, he warmly attached  himself to our society. But the gratitude of a savage is ever a precarious  tenure. That of Baneelon was fated to suffer suspension, and had well nigh  been obliterated by the following singular circumstance.    One day the natives were observed to assemble in more than an ordinary  number at their house on the point, and to be full of bustle and agitation,  repeatedly calling on the name of Baneelon, and that of 'deein' (a woman).  Between twelve and one o'clock Baneelon, unattended, came to the governor  at his house, and told him that he was going to put to death a woman  immediately, whom he had brought from Botany Bay. Having communicated  his intention, he was preparing to go away, seeming not to wish that the  governor should be present at the performance of the ceremony. But His  Excellency was so struck with the fierce gestures, and wild demeanour of  the other, who held in his hand one of our hatchets and frequently tried  the sharpness of it, that he determined to accompany him, taking with him  Mr. Collins and his orderly sergeant. On the road, Baneelon continued  to talk wildly and incoherently of what he would do, and manifested such  extravagant marks of fury and revenge, that his hatchet was taken away from  him, and a walking-stick substituted for it.    When they reached the house, they found several natives, of both sexes  lying promiscuously before the fire, and among them a young woman, not  more than sixteen years old, who at sight of Baneelon, started, and raised  herself half up. He no sooner saw her than, snatching a sword of the  country, he ran at her, and gave her two severe wounds on the head and one  on the shoulder, before interference in behalf of the poor wretch could  be made. Our people now rushed in and seized him; but the other Indians  continued quiet spectators of what was passing, either awed by Baneelon's  superiority or deeming it a common case, unworthy of notice and  interposition. In vain did the governor by turns soothe and threaten him.  In vain did the sergeant point his musquet at him. He seemed dead to every  passion but revenge; forgot his affection to his old friends and, instead  of complying with the request they made, furiously brandished his sword  at the governor, and called aloud for his hatchet to dispatch the unhappy  victim of his barbarity. Matters now wore a serious aspect. The other  Indians appeared under the control of Baneelon and had begun to arm and  prepare their spears, as if determined to support him in his violence.    Farther delay might have been attended with danger. The 'Supply' was  therefore immediately hailed, and an armed boat ordered to be sent on  shore. Luckily, those on board the ship had already observed the commotion  and a boat was ready, into which captain Ball, with several of his people  stepped, armed with musquets, and put off. It was reasonable to believe  that so powerful a reinforcement would restore tranquillity, but Baneelon  stood unintimidated at disparity of numbers and boldly demanded his  prisoner, whose life, he told the governor, he was determined to sacrifice,  and afterwards to cut off her head. Everyone was eager to know what could  be the cause of such inveterate inhumanity. Undaunted, he replied that her  father was his enemy, from whom he had received the wound in his forehead  beforementioned; and that when he was down in battle, and under the lance  of his antagonist, this woman had contributed to assail him. \"She is now,\"  added he, \"my property: I have ravished her by force from her tribe: and  I will part with her to no person whatever, until my vengeance shall be  glutted.\"    Farther remonstrance would have been wasted. His Excellency therefore  ordered the woman to be taken to the hospital in order that her wounds  might be dressed. While this was doing, one of the natives, a young man  named Boladeree, came up and supplicated to be taken into the boat also,  saying that he was her husband, which she confirmed and begged that he  might be admitted. He was a fine well grown lad, of nineteen or twenty  years old, and was one of the persons who had been in the house in the  scene just described, which he had in no wise endeavoured to prevent, or to  afford assistance to the poor creature who had a right to his protection.    All our people now quitted the place, leaving the exasperated Baneelon and  his associates to meditate farther schemes of vengeance. Before they parted  he gave them, however, to understand that he would follow the object of his  resentment to the hospital, and kill her there, a threat which the governor  assured him if he offered to carry into execution he should be immediately  shot. Even this menace he treated with disdain.    To place the refugees in security, a sentinel was ordered to take post  at the door of the house, in which they were lodged. Nevertheless they  attempted to get away in the night, either from fear that we were not  able to protect them, or some apprehension of being restrained from future  liberty. When questioned where they proposed to find shelter, they said  they would go to the Cameragal tribe, with whom they should be safe. On the  following morning, Imeerawanyee* joined them, and expressed strong fears of  Baneelon's resentment. Soon after a party of natives, known to consist of  Baneelon's chosen friends, with a man of the name of Bigon, at their head,  boldly entered the hospital garden, and tried to carry off all three by  force. They were driven back and threatened, to which their leader only  replied by contemptuous insolence.    [*This good-tempered lively lad, was become a great favourite with us, and  almost constantly lived at the governor's house. He had clothes made up for  him, and to amuse his mind, he was taught to wait at table. One day a lady,  Mrs. McArthur, wife of an officer of the garrison, dined there, as did  Nanbaree. This latter, anxious that his countryman should appear to  advantage in his new office, gave him many instructions, strictly charging  him, among other things, to take away the lady's plate, whenever she should  cross her knife and fork, and to give her a clean one. This Imeerawanyee  executed, not only to Mrs. McArthur, but to several of the other guests.  At last Nanbaree crossed his knife and fork with great gravity, casting a  glance at the other, who looked for a moment with cool indifference at  what he had done, and then turned his head another way. Stung at this  supercilious treatment, he called in rage, to know why he was not attended  to, as well as the rest of the company. But Imeerawanyee only laughed; nor  could all the anger and reproaches of the other prevail upon him to do  that for one of his countrymen, which he cheerfully continued to perform to  every other person.]    Baneelon finding he could not succeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#16)"],[1,"drama with a freshness,  accuracy, and artistic beauty, worthy of the immortal events which it  commemorates. Mr. Bancroft is now exclusively occupied in the  completion of this work. He pursues it with the drudging fidelity of a  mechanical laborer, combined with the enthusiasm of a poet and the  comprehensive wisdom of a statesman. With strong social tastes, he gives  little time to society. His favorite post is in his library, where he  labors the live-long day in the spirit of the ancient artist, _Nulla  dies sine linea_. His experience in political and diplomatic life, no  less than his rare and generous culture, and his singular union of the  highest mental faculties, enable us to predict with confidence that this  work will be reckoned among the genuine masterpieces of historical  genius. The volumes of the History of the United States already  published, are well known to intelligent readers both in Great Britain  and America. They are distinguished for their compact brevity of  statement, their terse and vigorous diction, their brilliant panoramic  views, and the boldness and grace of their sketches of personal  character. A still higher praise may be awarded to this history for the  tenacity with which it clings to the dominant and inspiring idea of  which it records the development. Whoever reads it without comprehending  the standpoint of the author, is liable to disappointment. For it must  be confessed that as a mere narrative of events, the preference may be  given to the productions of far inferior authors. But it is to be  regarded as an epic in prose of the triumph of freedom. This noble  principle is considered by Mr. Bancroft as an essential attribute of the  soul, necessarily asserting itself in proportion to the spiritual  supremacy which has been achieved. The history, then, is devoted to the  illustration of the progress of freedom, as an out-birth of the  spontaneous action of the soul. It is in this point of view that the  remarkable chapters on the Massachusetts Pilgrims, the Pennsylvania  Quakers, and the North American Indians, were written; and their full  purport, their profound significance, can only be appreciated by readers  whose minds possess at least the seeds of sympathy and cognateness with  this sublime philosophy. The chapter on the Quakers is a pregnant  psychological treatise. Sparkling all over with the electric lights of a  rich humanitary philosophy, it invests the theologic visions of Fox and  Barclay with a radiance and beauty which have been ill-preserved in the  formal and lifeless organic systems of their successors. The parallel  run by the historian between William Penn and John Locke is one of the  most characteristic productions of his peculiar genius. Original,  subtle, suggestive, crowded with matter and frugal of words, it brings  out the distinctive features of the spiritual and mechanical schools in  the persons of two of their 'representative men,' with a breadth and  reality which is seldom found in philosophical portraitures. Mr.  Bancroft was the son of an eminent Unitarian clergyman in Worcester,  Massachusetts. He was born about the beginning of the present century,  and is consequently a little more than fifty years of age. He graduated  at Harvard University, with distinguished honors, before he had  completed his fifteenth year. Soon after he sailed for Europe, and  continued his studies at the German Universities, returning to his own  country just before the attainment of his majority. Devoting himself for  several years to literary and educational pursuits, he acquired a  brilliant reputation as a poet, critic, and essayist; and at a  subsequent period, entering the career of politics, he has signalized  himself by his attachment to democratic ideas, and the eloquence and  force with which on all occasions he has sustained the principles with  the prevalence of which he identifies the progress of humanity.           *       *       *       *       *    From the Athenaeum.    The further this work proceeds, the more do we feel that it must take  its place as an essentially satisfactory history of the United States.  Mr. Bancroft is thoroughly American in thought and in feeling, without  ceasing to have those larger views and nobler sympathies which result  from cosmopolitan rather than from local training. His style is original  and national. It breathes of the mountain and the prairie--of the great  lakes and wild savannahs of his native land. A strain of wild and  forest-like music swells up in almost every line. The story is told  richly and vividly. It has hitherto been thought by Americans  themselves, even more than by Europeans, that the story of the English  colonies presented but a dreary and lifeless succession of petty  squabbles between the settlers and the crown officers--of unintelligible  persecutions of each other on the ground of differences of opinion in  religion. Mr. Bancroft has shown how ill founded has been this  impression. In his hands American history is full of fine effects.  Steeped in the colors of his imagination, a thousand incidents hitherto  thought dull appear animated and pictorial. Between Hildreth and  Bancroft the difference is immense. In the treatment of the former,  dates, facts, events are duly stated--the criticism is keen, the  chronology indisputable,--but the figures do not live, the narrative  knows no march. The latter is all movement. His men glow with human  purposes,--his story sweeps on with the exulting life of a procession.    Yet because Mr. Bancroft contrives to bring out the more romantic  aspects of his theme, it is not to be supposed that he fails in that  strict regard to truth--truth of character as well as of incident--which  is the historian's first duty, and without which all other qualities are  useless. Of all American writers who have written on the history of  their own country, we would pronounce him to be the most conscientious.  His former volumes were remarkable for the amplitude and accuracy of  their references. The authorities cited were often recondite and  obscure,--yet it was evident that they had been sifted carefully and  critically. The same may be said of the volume before us.    Careful research had enabled Mr. Bancroft to throw new light on several  points connected with the settlement and early history of his country.  As his dates approach nearer to the present time, the sources of new  information open on him in abundance. The MS, additions to our knowledge  of the times treated of in these volumes are considerable; but they are  spread pretty fairly over the entire narrative--lending a new light to  the events and adding a new trait to the characters--rather than thrown  into masses. The effect produced is more that of greater roundness and  completion than of absolute change in old historical verdicts. We quote  one out of innumerable instances of these minute but characteristic  additions. The historian is speaking of the Duke of Newcastle,--whose  ignorant government of the colonies was one of the chief sources of  their discontent:--         \"For nearly four-and-twenty years he remained minister for       British America; yet to the last, the statesman, who was       deeply versed in the statistics of elections, knew little of       the continent of which he was the guardian. He addressed       letters, it used to be confidently said, to 'the island of       New England,' and could not tell but that Jamaica was in the       Mediterranean. Heaps of colonial memorials and letters       remained unread in his office; and a paper was almost sure       of neglect unless some agent remained with him to see it       opened. His frivolous nature could never glow with       affection, or grasp a great idea, or analyze complex       relations. After long research, I cannot find that he ever       once attended seriously to an American question, or had a       clear conception of one American measure.\"    Walpole had told us that Newcastle did not know where Jamaica was:--the  amusing address \"Island of New England\" Mr. Bancroft finds referred to  in a manuscript letter of J. Q. Adams. It serves to suggest that what is  usually thought to be a joke of Walpole's was probably the literal  truth:--the man who is sufficiently innocent of geography to make New  England an island, would have no difficulty in confounding the East and  West Indies.    In this volume we first meet with the great character who is to be the  hero of the Revolution now looming before the reader. Mr. Bancroft  treats us to no full-length portrait of George Washington:--instead of a  picture he presents us with the man. Washington comes before us at  twenty-one,--in the chamber of Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia; from  whom he is accepting a perilous but most important mission--to cross the  forests, rivers, and mountains which separate Williamsburg and Lake  Erie, in the depths of a severe winter, and there endeavor to detach the  Delaware Indians from the French alliance. All the elements of  Washington's greatness--his courage, hardihood, military prescience, and  merciful disposition--are stamped indelibly on this the first act of his  public life:--         \"In the middle of November, with an interpreter and four       attendants, and Christopher Gist as a guide, he left Will's       Creek, and following the Indian trace through forest       solitudes, gloomy with the fallen leaves, and solemn sadness       of late autumn, across mountains, rocky ravines, and       streams, through sleet and snows, he rode in nine days to       the fork of the Ohio. How lonely was the spot, where, so       long unheeded of men, the rapid Allegheny met nearly at       right angles 'the deep and still' water of the Monongahela!       At once Washington foresaw the destiny of the place. 'I       spent some time,' said he, 'in viewing the rivers;' 'the       land in the Fork has the absolute command of"]]]
