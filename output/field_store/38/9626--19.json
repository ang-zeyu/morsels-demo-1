What will you say then?\" In  this and other ways, as fear and confidence are created in the minds of  children, so should the man gain her over to his wishes.    On the second and third nights, after her confidence has increased still  more, he should feel the whole of her body with his hands, and kiss her  all over; he should also place his hands upon her thighs and shampoo  them, and if he succeed in this he should then shampoo the joints of her  thighs. If she tries to prevent him doing this he should say to her,  \"What harm is there in doing it?\" and should persuade her to let him do  it. After gaining this point he should touch her private parts, should  loosen her girdle and the knot of her dress, and turning up her lower  garment should shampoo the joints of her naked thighs. Under various  pretences he should do all these things, but he should not at that time  begin actual congress. After this he should teach her the sixty-four  arts, should tell her how much he loves her, and describe to her the  hopes which he formerly entertained regarding her. He should also  promise to be faithful to her in future, and should dispel all her fears  with respect to rival women, and, at last, after having overcome her  bashfulness, he should begin to enjoy her in a way so as not to frighten  her. So much about creating confidence in the girl; and there are,  moreover, some verses on the subject as follows:--    A man acting according to the inclinations of a girl should try and gain  her over so that she may love him and place her confidence in him. A  man does not succeed either by implicitly following the inclination of a  girl, or by wholly opposing her, and he should therefore adopt a middle  course. He who knows how to make himself beloved by women, as well as to  increase their honour and create confidence in them, this man becomes an  object of their love. But he, who neglects a girl thinking she is too  bashful, is despised by her as a beast ignorant of the working of the  female mind. Moreover, a girl forcibly enjoyed by one who does not  understand the hearts of girls becomes nervous, uneasy, and dejected,  and suddenly begins to hate the man who has taken advantage of her; and  then, when her love is not understood or returned, she sinks into  despondency, and becomes either a hater of mankind altogether, or,  hating her own man, she has recourse to other men.[48]    FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 48: These last few lines have been exemplified in many ways in  many novels of this century.]          CHAPTER III.    ON COURTSHIP, AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FEELINGS BY OUTWARD SIGNS AND  DEEDS.      A poor man possessed of good qualities, a man born of a low family  possessed of mediocre qualities, a neighbour possessed of wealth, and  one under the control of his father, mother or brothers, should not  marry without endeavouring to gain over the girl from her childhood to  love and esteem them. Thus a boy separated from his parents, and living  in the house of his uncle, should try to gain over the daughter of his  uncle, or some other girl, even though she be previously betrothed to  another. And this way of gaining over a girl, says Ghotakamukha, is  unexceptional, because Dharma can be accomplished by means of it, as  well as by any other way of marriage.    When a boy has thus begun to woo the girl he loves, he should spend his  time with her and amuse her with various games and diversions fitted for  their age and acquaintanceship, such as picking and collecting flowers,  making garlands of flowers, playing the parts of members of a fictitious  family, cooking food, playing with dice, playing with cards, the game of  odd and even, the game of finding out the middle finger, the game of six  pebbles, and such other games as may be prevalent in the country, and  agreeable to the disposition of the girl. In addition to this, he should  carry on various amusing games played by several persons together, such  as hide and seek, playing with seeds, hiding things in several small  heaps of wheat and looking for them, blind-man's buff, gymnastic  exercises, and other games of the same sort, in company with the girl,  her friends and female attendants. The man should also show great  kindness to any woman whom the girl thinks fit to be trusted, and should  also make new acquaintances, but above all he should attach to himself  by kindness and little services the daughter of the girl's nurse, for  if she be gained over, even though she comes to know of his design, she  does not cause any obstruction, but is sometimes even able to effect an  union between him and the girl. And though she knows the true character  of the man, she always talks of his many excellent qualities to the  parents and relations of the girl, even though she may not be desired to  do so by him.    In this way the man should do whatever the girl takes most delight in,  and he should get for her whatever she may have a desire to possess.  Thus he should procure for her such playthings as may be hardly known to  other girls. He may also show her a ball dyed with various colours, and  other curiosities of the same sort; and should give her dolls made of  cloth, wood, buffalo-horn, ivory, wax, flour, or earth; also utensils  for cooking food, and figures in wood, such as a man and woman standing,  a pair of rams, or goats, or sheep; also temples made of earth, bamboo,  or wood, dedicated to various goddesses; and cages for parrots, cuckoos,  starlings, quails, cocks, and partridges; water-vessels of different  sorts and of elegant forms, machines for throwing water about, guitars,  stands for putting images upon, stools, lac, red arsenic, yellow  ointment, vermilion and collyrium, as well as sandal-wood, saffron,  betel nut and betel leaves. Such things should be given at different  times whenever he gets a good opportunity of meeting her, and some of  them should be given in private, and some in public, according to  circumstances. In short, he should try in every way to make her look  upon him as one who would do for her everything that she wanted to be  done.    In the next place he should get her to meet him in some place privately,  and should then tell her that the reason of his giving presents to her  in secret was the fear that the parents of both of them might be  displeased, and then he may add that the things which he had given her  had been much desired by other people. When her love begins to show  signs of increasing he should relate to her agreeable stories if she  expresses a wish to hear such narratives. Or if she takes delight in  legerdemain, he should amaze her by performing various tricks of  jugglery; or if she feels a great curiosity to see a performance of the  various arts, he should show his own skill in them. When she is  delighted with singing he should entertain her with music, and on  certain days, and at the time of going together to moonlight fairs and  festivals, and at the time of her return after being absent from home,  he should present her with bouquets of flowers, and with chaplets for  the head, and with ear ornaments and rings, for these are the proper  occasions on which such things should be presented.    He should also teach the daughter of the girl's nurse all the sixty-four  means of pleasure practised by men, and under this pretext should also  inform her of his great skill in the art of sexual enjoyment. All this  time he should wear a fine dress, and make as good an appearance as  possible, for young women love men who live with them, and who are  handsome, good looking and well dressed. As for the saying that though  women may fall in love, they still make no effort themselves to gain  over the object of their affections, that is only a matter of idle talk.    Now a girl always shows her love by outward signs and actions, such as  the following:--She never looks the man in the face, and becomes abashed  when she is looked at by him; under some pretext or other she shows her  limbs to him; she looks secretly at him though he has gone away from her  side; hangs down her head when she is asked some question by him, and  answers in indistinct words and unfinished sentences, delights to be in  his company for a long time, speaks to her attendants in a peculiar tone  with the hope of attracting his attention towards her when she is at a  distance from him, does not wish to go from the place where he is, under  some pretext or other she makes him look at different things, narrates  to him tales and stories very slowly so that she may continue conversing  with him for a long time, kisses and embraces before him a child sitting  in her lap, draws ornamental marks on the foreheads of her female  servants, performs sportive and graceful movements when her attendants  speak jestingly to her in the presence of her lover, confides in her  lover's friends, and respects and obeys them, shows kindness to his  servants, converses with them, and engages them to do her work as if she  were their mistress, and listens attentively to them when they tell  stories about her lover to somebody else, enters his house when induced  to do so by the daughter of her nurse, and by her assistance manages to  converse and play with him, avoids being seen by her lover when she is  not dressed and decorated, gives him by the hand of her female friend  her ear ornament, ring, or garland of flowers that he may have asked to  see, always wears anything that he may have presented to her, become  dejected when any other bridegroom is mentioned by her parents, and does  not mix with those who may be of her party, or who may support his  claims.

My engaging friend here has--an I mistake  not--a passport ready for me in the pocket of his sable-hued coat, and  as we are hoping effectually to spit one another over there... gadzooks!  but there's the specific purpose.... Is it not true, sir,\" he added,  turning once more to Chauvelin, \"that in the pocket of that exquisitely  cut coat of yours, you have a passport--name in blank perhaps--which you  had specially designed for me?\"    It was so carelessly, so pleasantly said, that no one save Chauvelin  guessed the real import of Sir Percy's words. Chauvelin, of course, knew  their inner meaning: he understood that Blakeney wished to convey to him  the fact that he was well aware that the whole scene to-night had been  prearranged, and that it was willingly and with eyes wide open that he  walked into the trap which the revolutionary patriot had so carefully  laid for him.    \"The passport will be forthcoming in due course, sir,\" retorted  Chauvelin evasively, \"when our seconds have arranged all formalities.\"    \"Seconds be demmed, sir,\" rejoined Sir Percy placidly, \"you do not  propose, I trust, that we travel a whole caravan to France.\"    \"Time, place and conditions must be settled, Sir Percy,\" replied  Chauvelin; \"you are too accomplished a cavalier, I feel sure, to wish to  arrange such formalities yourself.\"    \"Nay! neither you nor I, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin,\" quoth Sir Percy  blandly, \"could, I own, settle such things with persistent good-humour;  and good-humour in such cases is the most important of all formalities.  Is it not so?\"    \"Certainly, Sir Percy.\"    \"As for seconds? Perish the thought. One second only, I entreat, and  that one a lady--the most adorable--the most detestable--the most  true--the most fickle amidst all her charming sex.... Do you agree,  sir?\"    \"You have not told me her name, Sir Percy?\"    \"Chance, Monsieur, Chance.... With His Royal Highness' permission let  the wilful jade decide.\"    \"I do not understand.\"    \"Three throws of the dice, Monsieur.... Time... Place... Conditions, you  said--three throws and the winner names them.... Do you agree?\"    Chauvelin hesitated. Sir Percy's bantering mood did not quite fit  in with his own elaborate plans, moreover the ex-ambassador feared  a pitfall of some sort, and did not quite like to trust to this  arbitration of the dice-box.    He turned, quite involuntarily, in appeal to the Prince of Wales and the  other gentlemen present.    But the Englishman of those days was a born gambler. He lived with the  dice-box in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other. The Prince  himself was no exception to this rule, and the first gentleman in  England was the most avowed worshipper of Hazard in the land.    \"Chance, by all means,\" quoth His Highness gaily.    \"Chance! Chance!\" repeated the others eagerly.    In the midst of so hostile a crowd, Chauvelin felt it unwise to resist.  Moreover, one second's reflection had already assured him that this  throwing of the dice could not seriously interfere with the success of  his plans. If the meeting took place at all--and Sir Percy now had gone  too far to draw back--then of necessity it would have to take place in  France.    The question of time and conditions of the fight, which at best would  be only a farce--only a means to an end--could not be of paramount  importance.    Therefore he shrugged his shoulders with well-marked indifference, and  said lightly:    \"As you please.\"    There was a small table in the centre of the room with a settee and two  or three chairs arranged close to it. Around this table now an eager  little group had congregated: the Prince of Wales in the forefront,  unwilling to interfere, scarce knowing what madcap plans were floating  through Blakeney's adventurous brain, but excited in spite of himself at  this momentous game of hazard the issues of which seemed so nebulous,  so vaguely fraught with dangers. Close to him were Sir Andrew Ffoulkes,  Lord Anthony Dewhurst, Lord Grenville and perhaps a half score  gentlemen, young men about town mostly, gay and giddy butterflies of  fashion, who did not even attempt to seek in this strange game of chance  any hidden meaning save that it was one of Blakeney's irresponsible  pranks.    And in the centre of the compact group, Sir Percy Blakeney in his  gorgeous suit of shimmering white satin, one knee bent upon a chair, and  leaning with easy grace--dice-box in hand--across the small gilt-legged  table; beside him ex-Ambassador Chauvelin, standing with arms folded  behind his back, watching every movement of his brilliant adversary like  some dark-plumaged hawk hovering near a bird of paradise.    \"Place first, Monsieur?\" suggested Sir Percy.    \"As you will, sir,\" assented Chauvelin.    He took up a dice-box which one of the gentlemen handed to him and the  two men threw.    \"'Tis mine, Monsieur,\" said Blakeney carelessly, \"mine to name the place  where shall occur this historic encounter, 'twixt the busiest man  in France and the most idle fop that e'er disgraced these three  kingdoms.... Just for the sake of argument, sir, what place would you  suggest?\"    \"Oh! the exact spot is immaterial, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin coldly,  \"the whole of France stands at your disposal.\"    \"Aye! I thought as much, but could not be quite sure of such boundless  hospitality,\" retorted Blakeney imperturbably.    \"Do you care for the woods around Paris, sir?\"    \"Too far from the coast, sir. I might be sea-sick crossing over the  Channel, and glad to get the business over as soon as possible.... No,  not Paris, sir--rather let us say Boulogne.... Pretty little place,  Boulogne... do you not think so...?\"    \"Undoubtedly, Sir Percy.\"    \"Then Boulogne it is.. the ramparts, an you will, on the south side of  the town.\"    \"As you please,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily. \"Shall we throw again?\"    A murmur of merriment had accompanied this brief colloquy between the  adversaries, and Blakeney's bland sallies were received with shouts of  laughter. Now the dice rattled again and once more the two men threw.    \"'Tis yours this time, Monsieur Chauvelin,\" said Blakeney, after a rapid  glance at the dice. \"See how evenly Chance favours us both. Mine, the  choice of place... admirably done you'll confess.... Now yours the  choice of time. I wait upon your pleasure, sir.... The southern ramparts  at Boulogne--when?\"    \"The fourth day from this, sir, at the hour when the Cathedral bell  chimes the evening Angelus,\" came Chauvelin's ready reply.    \"Nay! but methought that your demmed government had abolished  Cathedrals, and bells and chimes.... The people of France have now to  go to hell their own way... for the way to heaven has been barred by  the National Convention.... Is that not so?... Methought the Angelus was  forbidden to be rung.\"    \"Not at Boulogne, I think, Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, \"and  I'll pledge you my word that the evening Angelus shall be rung that  night.\"    \"At what hour is that, sir?\"    \"One hour after sundown.\"    \"But why four days after this? Why not two or three?\"    \"I might have asked, why the southern ramparts, Sir Percy; why not the  western? I chose the fourth day--does it not suit you?\" asked Chauvelin  ironically.    \"Suit me! Why, sir, nothing could suit me better,\" rejoined Blakeney  with his pleasant laugh. \"Zounds! but I call it marvellous... demmed  marvellous... I wonder now,\" he added blandly, \"what made you think of  the Angelus?\"    Everyone laughed at this, a little irrelevantly perhaps.    \"Ah!\" continued Blakeney gaily, \"I remember now.... Faith! to think that  I was nigh forgetting that when last you and I met, sir, you had just  taken or were about to take Holy Orders.... Ah! how well the thought  of the Angelus fits in with your clerical garb.... I recollect that the  latter was mightily becoming to you, sir...\"    \"Shall we proceed to settle the conditions of the fight, Sir Percy?\"  said Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's gibes, and  trying to disguise his irritation beneath a mask of impassive reserve.    \"The choice of weapons you mean,\" here interposed His Royal Highness,  \"but I thought that swords had already been decided on.\"    \"Quite so, your Highness,\" assented Blakeney, \"but there are various  little matters in connection with this momentous encounter which are of  vast importance.... Am I not right, Monsieur?... Gentlemen, I appeal to  you.... Faith! one never knows... my engaging opponent here might desire  that I should fight him in green socks, and I that he should wear a  scarlet flower in his coat.\"    \"The Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy?\"    \"Why not, Monsieur? It would look so well in your buttonhole, against  the black of the clerical coat, which I understand you sometime affect  in France... and when it is withered and quite dead you would find that  it would leave an overpowering odour in your nostrils, far stronger than  that of incense.\"    There was general laughter after this. The hatred which every member of  the French revolutionary government--including, of course, ex-Ambassador  Chauvelin--bore to the national hero was well known.    \"The conditions then, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, without seeming to  notice the taunt conveyed in Blakeney's last words. \"Shall we throw  again?\"    \"After you, sir,\" acquiesced Sir Percy.    For the third and last time the two opponents rattled the dice-box and  threw. Chauvelin was now absolutely unmoved. These minor details quite  failed to interest him. What mattered the conditions of the fight which  was only intended as a bait with which to lure his enemy in the open?  The hour and place were decided on and Sir Percy would not fail to come.  Chauvelin knew enough of his opponent's boldly adventurous spirit not  to feel in the least doubtful on that point. Even now, as he gazed with  grudging admiration at the massive, well-knit figure of his arch-enemy,  noted the thin"]]]
