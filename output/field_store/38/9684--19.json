General customs; which are the universal rule of the whole  kingdom, and form the common law, in it's stricter and more usual  signification. 2. Particular customs; which for the most part affect  only the inhabitants of particular districts. 3. Certain particular  laws; which by custom are adopted and used by some particular courts,  of pretty general and extensive jurisdiction.    I. AS to general customs, or the common law, properly so called; this  is that law, by which proceedings and determinations in the king's  ordinary courts of justice are guided and directed. This, for the most  part, settles the course in which lands descend by inheritance; the  manner and form of acquiring and transferring property; the  solemnities and obligation of contracts; the rules of expounding  wills, deeds, and acts of parliament; the respective remedies of civil  injuries; the several species of temporal offences, with the manner  and degree of punishment; and an infinite number of minuter  particulars, which diffuse themselves as extensively as the ordinary  distribution of common justice requires. Thus, for example, that there  shall be four superior courts of record, the chancery, the king's  bench, the common pleas, and the exchequer;--that the eldest son alone  is heir to his ancestor;--that property may be acquired and  transferred by writing;--that a deed is of no validity unless  sealed;--that wills shall be construed more favorably, and deeds more  strictly;--that money lent upon bond is recoverable by action of  debt;--that breaking the public peace is an offence, and punishable by  fine and imprisonment;--all these are doctrines that are not set down  in any written statute or ordinance, but depend merely upon immemorial  usage, that is, upon common law, for their support.    SOME have divided the common law into two principal grounds or  foundations: 1. established customs; such as that where there are  three brothers, the eldest brother shall be heir to the second, in  exclusion of the youngest: and 2. established rules and maxims; as,  \"that the king can do no wrong, that no man shall be bound to accuse  himself,\" and the like. But I take these to be one and the same thing.  For the authority of these maxims rests entirely upon general  reception and usage; and the only method of proving, that this or that  maxim is a rule of the common law, is by shewing that it hath been  always the custom to observe it.    BUT here a very natural, and very material, question arises: how are  these customs or maxims to be known, and by whom is their validity to  be determined? The answer is, by the judges in the several courts of  justice. They are the depositary of the laws; the living oracles, who  must decide in all cases of doubt, and who are bound by an oath to  decide according to the law of the land. Their knowlege of that law is  derived from experience and study; from the \"_viginti annorum  lucubrationes_,\" which Fortescue[n] mentions; and from being long  personally accustomed to the judicial decisions of their predecessors.  And indeed these judicial decisions are the principal and most  authoritative evidence, that can be given, of the existence of such a  custom as shall form a part of the common law. The judgment itself,  and all the proceedings previous thereto, are carefully registered and  preserved, under the name of _records_, in publick repositories set  apart for that particular purpose; and to them frequent recourse is  had, when any critical question arises, in the determination of which  former precedents may give light or assistance. And therefore, even so  early as the conquest, we find the \"_praeteritorum memoria eventorum_\"  reckoned up as one of the chief qualifications of those who were held  to be \"_legibus patriae optime instituti_[o].\" For it is an  established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points  come again in litigation; as well to keep the scale of justice even  and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion; as  also because the law in that case being solemnly declared and  determined, what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is now  become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any  subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private  sentiments: he being sworn to determine, not according to his own  private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the  land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and  expound the old one. Yet this rule admits of exception, where the  former determination is most evidently contrary to reason; much more  if it be contrary to the divine law. But even in such cases the  subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate  the old one from misrepresentation. For if it be found that the former  decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such  a sentence was _bad law_, but that it was _not law_; that is, that it  is not the established custom of the realm, as has been erroneously  determined. And hence it is that our lawyers are with justice so  copious in their encomiums on the reason of the common law; that they  tell us, that the law is the perfection of reason, that it always  intends to conform thereto, and that what is not reason is not law.  Not that the particular reason of every rule in the law can at this  distance of time be always precisely assigned; but it is sufficient  that there be nothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason, and  then the law will presume it to be well founded[p]. And it hath been  an antient observation in the laws of England, that whenever a  standing rule of law, of which the reason perhaps could not be  remembered or discerned, hath been wantonly broke in upon by statutes  or new resolutions, the wisdom of the rule hath in the end appeared  from the inconveniences that have followed the innovation.    [Footnote n: _cap._ 8.]    [Footnote o: Seld. review of Tith. c. 8.]    [Footnote p: Herein agreeing with the civil law, _Ff._ 1. 3. 20, 21.  \"_Non omnium, quae a majoribus nostris constituta sunt, ratio reddi  potest. Et ideo rationes eorum quae constituuntur, inquiri non  oportet: alioquin multa ex his, quae certa sunt, subvertuntur._\"]    THE doctrine of the law then is this: that precedents and rules must  be followed, unless flatly absurd or unjust: for though their reason  be not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a deference to former  times as not to suppose they acted wholly without consideration. To  illustrate this doctrine by examples. It has been determined, time out  of mind, that a brother of the half blood (i.e. where they have only  one parent the same, and the other different) shall never succeed as  heir to the estate of his half brother, but it shall rather escheat to  the king, or other superior lord. Now this is a positive law, fixed  and established by custom, which custom is evidenced by judicial  decisions; and therefore can never be departed from by any modern  judge without a breach of his oath and the law. For herein there is  nothing repugnant to natural justice; though the reason of it, drawn  from the feodal law, may not be quite obvious to every body. And  therefore, on account of a supposed hardship upon the half brother, a  modern judge might wish it had been otherwise settled; yet it is not  in his power to alter it. But if any court were now to determine, that  an elder brother of the half blood might enter upon and seise any  lands that were purchased by his younger brother, no subsequent judges  would scruple to declare that such prior determination was unjust, was  unreasonable, and therefore was _not law_. So that _the law_, and the  _opinion of the judge_ are not always convertible terms, or one and  the same thing; since it sometimes may happen that the judge may  _mistake_ the law. Upon the whole however, we may take it as a general  rule, \"that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of  what is common law:\" in the same manner as, in the civil law, what the  emperor had once determined was to serve for a guide for the  future[q].    [Footnote q: \"_Si imperialis majestas causam cognitionaliter  examinaverit, et partibus cominus constitutis sententiam dixerit,  omnes omnino judices, qui sub nostro imperio sunt, sciant hanc esse  legem, non solum illi causae pro qua producta est, sed et in omnibus  similibus._\" _C._ 1. 14. 12.]    THE decisions therefore of courts are held in the highest regard, and  are not only preserved as authentic records in the treasuries of the  several courts, but are handed out to public view in the numerous  volumes of _reports_ which furnish the lawyer's library. These reports  are histories of the several cases, with a short summary of the  proceedings, which are preserved at large in the record; the arguments  on both sides; and the reasons the court gave for their judgment;  taken down in short notes by persons present at the determination. And  these serve as indexes to, and also to explain, the records; which  always, in matters of consequence and nicety, the judges direct to be  searched. The reports are extant in a regular series from the reign of  king Edward the second inclusive; and from his time to that of Henry  the eighth were taken by the prothonotaries, or chief scribes of the  court, at the expence of the crown, and published _annually_, whence  they are known under the denomination of the _year books_. And it is  much to be wished that this beneficial custom had, under proper  regulations, been continued to this day: for, though king James the  first at the instance of lord Bacon appointed two reporters with a  handsome stipend for this purpose, yet that wise institution was soon  neglected, and from the reign of Henry the eighth to the present time  this task has been executed by many private and cotemporary hands; who  sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#16)"],[1,"designs on a mat of this kind is by dividing the whole mat  with a diameter through its center.    Fold the mat and make a crease at the edges or mark a diameter  through it with a pencil; at right angles to this diameter draw  another through the same center, and the mat will now be divided into  equal quadrants. The quadrants may again be divided and subdivided,  and marked by pencil or with strings.    In Design A the mat is about 57 inches in diameter. In a mat of  this size there would be 48 units in the circle with a margin of  1-1/2 inches from the outer edge of the outer border line to the  circumference of the mat. Divide the mat into halves, quarters,  eighths, and sixteenths, and measure with strings. Each sixteenth  contains three units. Divide this space into three equal parts.    Now embroider in each third one exact unit. In weaving in the unit,  always commence on its outer edge; then if any slight variation of  space has occurred, the irregularity will not be noticeable, as it  will be in the line work of the unit, and not in its solid part. Each  unit made in working as suggested from the outer edge inward will  begin the other half of a solid figure already commenced. Notice the  part of the design which has been marked off as one unit, and adhere  to that arrangement.    This design may be placed on a mat 57 inches in diameter, or 114  inches in diameter making each figure with twice as many straws as  in the first.    In ticug mats of natural straw, this design may be done in the  following colors:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, or 16. (12 and 16 should not be used  on sabutan.)    No. 14, with a solid diamond and outer border line in No. 3.    No. 3, 6, 9, or 10, with outer border line extending to edge of mat.        Design B.    In Design B, the mat should be 56 inches in diameter. In each sixteenth  of the mat, as in Design A, three units can be spaced. Note the unit  marked off in the design and use only this unit; weave its two outer  solid parts first, with the irregularities of space occurring in the  open part of the unit. [35]    Mats woven for this design should be 56 or 112 inches in diameter. In  mats of the latter size the numbers of straws are all doubled.    In mats of natural straw, the following colors may be used:    No. 2, 3, 6, 10, 15, or 16. (16 should not be used on sabutan.)        Circular Fish Design.    This design calls for the division of a circular mat into sixths or  twelfths, according to the size of the mat. The diameters of mats for  this design may be, 244 (about 4 feet); 304 (5 feet); 335 (6 feet);  and 366 straws (7 feet). To divide a circle into sixths, mark off  the circumference into distances equal to 1/2 of the diameter.    In a mat of 244 straws diameter, make the outside border line one  inch from the edges of the mat. About 9 inches inside of the outer  border line, weave another border line one-half inch wide. Midway  between these two border lines, measure and mark the space for the  center fish, making it 30 counts long, 20 on the left and 10 on the  right of the dividing line.    Measure spaces on the other five dividing lines to locate the central  fish of each group. After weaving these central fish, go back to the  first group, estimate and mark the place for the upper fish and the  lower fish, and weave them, making each of the same size and proportion  as the central fish, as shown in the design.    In mat 304, as noted above, the border lines and all the fish are  the same size as in mat 244.    In mat 335 all measurements are the same as in the above mats,  except that the circle is divided into twelfths instead of sixths,  making twice as many groups of fish.    In mat 366 the outer border line is 2 inches from the edge of the mat  instead of 1 inch and is 1 1/2 inches thick. The other measurements  are the same as in mat 335.    In mats of natural straw, the following colors may be used: No. 2,  3, 6, 10, 12, or 15. (12 should not be used on sabutan.)        Gecko Design.    Mats woven for this design should be of the following diameters: 304  (5 feet); 335 (6 feet); 366 straws (7 feet).    Divide the circle into sixths, then into twelfths. Weave a border  band on the edge of the mat 3/4 inch wide. This band is not in the  design but will come outside, and reach to the circumference line in  the design. Down one of the twelve dividing lines, inside the border  band, measure off 3 1/2 inches and weave a gecko, half on one side  and half on the other side of the line, extending the tail about 5  1/2 inches toward the center of the mat. Weave the two on each side  of this gecko, and the four above it. Now space and weave the other  five groups. Each group contains seven figures.    The only difference in the larger mats will be in the spacing between  the tails. The groups should be spaced the same as before.    In ticug mats of natural straw, the following colors may be used:    No. 1 with band of No. 3.    No. 1 with band of No. 9.    No. 12 with band of No. 15. (No. 3 should not be used on sabutan.)    No. (singly) 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, or 15.        Geometric Design F.    The distance from A (the corner of the mat) to B is 12 straws;  from B to C is 2;  from C to D is 18;  from D to E is 29;  from D to H is 16;  from H to I is 32;  from E to F is 19; and  from F to G is 5.      Count from A to B. Weave from B to C and on around the entire mat.    Count from C to D and weave corner D H J E L. Weave all of the four  corner designs exactly like D H J E L. Count from E to F and weave  the two inner border lines around the entire mat.    Now count from H to I and mark similar points across one side. Weave  from H to I. Weave from I to the next point (32 counts distant) the  exact design between H and I. Weave at each point marked. Complete  all four sides in a similar manner.    Mats woven for this design should be made in the following sizes:    310 by 534--from A to B is 34 straws;  266 by 394--from A to B is 22;  512 by 704--from A to B is 12;  320 by 512--from A to B is 12 (double count);  320 by 576--from A to B is 12 (double count).    In the last two sizes make the design twice as large as the count;  that is, A B should be 24, B C should be 4, C D should be 36, etc.    In mats of natural color straw, the following colors may be used:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, or 16, each alone. (12 and 16 should not  be used on sabutan.)        Geometric Design V.    The distance from the corner of the mat A to B is 22 straws;  from B to C is 12;  from C to D is 4;  from D to F is 2;  from D to E is 15;  from F to G is 15;  from L to M is 14;  from C to N is 38;  from N to O is 12;  from F to P is 20; and  from P to Q is 25.    Count from A to B. At B weave the corner double square and continue  on at FD to GE. Now weave the double square G H J E. Next weave the  double squares in all four corners of the mat.    Now count from P to Q and mark. In the same way mark all the centers of  the squares along the outer border line from corner to corner. Weave  these squares, then the lines joining them. Weave down from L to M  and continue the design on the inner border line, making double lines  like L M as the weaving progresses.    Mats woven for this design should be of the following sizes:  228 by 378--from A to B is 22 straws;  253 by 403--from A to B is 22 straws;  311 by 536--from A to B is 30 straws;  536 by 686--from A to B is 30 straws.    In straw mats of natural color, the following colors may be used:  No. 2, 3, 6, 10, or 15.        Geometric Design X.    The distance from A (corner of mat) to B is 22 straws (counting the  fold at A);  from B to C is 8;  from C to D is 5;  from D to E is 4;  from E to F is 20;  from F to G is 4;  from G to H is 3;  from H to I is 6; and  from J to L is 52.    Count from A to B and weave border line around the entire mat. Count  from B to C and weave C D and over to J, back to H, over to K and back  to C. Weave inner part of corner design. Weave inner border line at  I entirely around the mat. Weave all four corner designs. Mark off J  L, and L M, and M N, etc., until the corner is reached, making L M,  M N, etc., each equal to J L. Weave all designs on side now spaced  off. Space off and mark each side of the mat, before weaving. Weave  all sides, completing the mat.    Mats woven for this design should be in the following sizes:  269 by 425;  321 by 529;  425 by 685;  165 by 425.    In mats of uncolored straw, the following colors may be used:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 16. (12 and 16 should not be used on  sabutan.)        Geometric Design Z.    The distance from the corner A to B is 12 straws;  from B to C is 3;  from C to D is 16;  from D to E is 8;  from E to F is 26;  from F to G is 17;  from G to H is 4;  from D to K is 17;  from K to L is 12;  from L to M is 17; and  from I to J is 29.    Count down from A to B and weave the border lines B C around the  entire mat. Count from C to D and weave the outer square of the corner  figure. Complete the corner figure to I and N. Count from F to G and  weave G H around the entire mat. Complete all four corner designs.    Count from I to J and mark. From J count a distance equal to I J  and mark. Make similar marks until the corner is reached. Weave the  design I L M J between all these marks. Space off each side of the  mat in the same way and finish the design on all sides.    Mats woven for this design should be of the following sizes:  309 by 541--from A to B is 12 straws;  319 by 551--from A to B is 22 straws;  280 by 454--from A to B is 12 straws;  551 by 696--from A to B is 22 straws.    On mats of uncolored straw, the following colors may be used:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 15, or 16. (16 should not be used on sabutan.)    No. 14 for border lines and the four large spots in the side of each  square; No. 3 for the remainder of the design.    No. 12 with spots and border lines of No. 3.        Large Banca Design.
