At the same time messengers were  sent to bring the fisherman's mother to the palace.    The marvellous guzla played the sweetest music at the marriage feast,  while the old king ate and drank and enjoyed himself, and danced like  a madman. He treated his guests with so much kindness and generosity  that to this very hour the happiness of those who were present is a  thing to be talked about and envied.    Now you see what it is to love virtue and pursue it with energy and  courage. For by so doing a mere peasant, a poor simple fisherman,  married the most lovely and enchanting princess in the whole world. He  received, besides, half the kingdom on his wedding day, and the right  of succession to the throne after the old king's death.          THE BROAD MAN, THE TALL MAN, AND THE MAN WITH EYES OF FLAME          [Illustration]    THE BROAD MAN, THE TALL MAN, AND THE MAN WITH EYES OF FLAME      It was in those days when cats wore shoes, when frogs croaked in  grandmothers' chairs, when donkeys clanked their spurs on the  pavements like brave knights, and when hares chased dogs. So you see  it must have been a very very long time ago.    In those days the king of a certain country had a daughter, who was  not only exceedingly beautiful but also remarkably clever. Many kings  and princes travelled from far distant lands, each one with the hope  of making her his wife. But she would have nothing to do with any one  of them. Finally, it was proclaimed that she would marry that man who  for three successive nights should keep such strict watch upon her  that she could not escape unnoticed. Those who failed were to have  their heads cut off.    The news of this offer was noised about in all parts of the world. A  great many kings and princes hastened to make the trial, taking their  turn and keeping watch. But each one lost his life in the attempt, for  they could not prevent, indeed they were not even able to see, the  princess take her flight.    Now it happened that Matthias, prince of a royal city, heard of what  was going on and resolved to watch through the three nights. He was  young, handsome as a deer, and brave as a falcon. His father did all  he could to turn him from his purpose: he used entreaties, prayers,  threats, in fact he forbade him to go, but in vain, nothing could  prevent him. What could the poor father do? Worn-out with contention,  he was at last obliged to consent. Matthias filled his purse with  gold, girded a well-tried sword to his side, and quite alone started  off to seek the fortune of the brave.    Walking along next day, he met a man who seemed hardly able to drag  one leg after the other.    \"Whither are you going?\" asked Matthias.    \"I am travelling all over the world in search of happiness.\"    \"What is your profession?\"    \"I have no profession, but I can do what no one else can. I am called  _Broad_, because I have the power of swelling myself out to such a  size that there is room for a whole regiment of soldiers inside me.\"    So saying he puffed himself out till he formed a barricade from one  side of the road to the other.    \"Bravo!\" cried Matthias, delighted at this proof of his capacities.  \"By the way, would you mind coming with me? I, too, am travelling  across the world in search of happiness.\"    \"If there is nothing bad in it I am quite willing,\" answered Broad.  And they continued their journey together.    A little further on they met a very slender man, frightfully thin, and  tall and straight as a portico.    \"Whither are you going, good man?\" asked Matthias, filled with  curiosity at his strange appearance.    \"I am travelling about the world.\"    \"To what profession do you belong?\"    \"To no profession, but I know something every one else is ignorant of.  I am called _Tall_, and with good reason. For without leaving the  earth I can stretch out and reach up to the clouds. When I walk I  clear a mile at each step.\"    Without more ado he lengthened himself out until his head was lost in  the clouds, while he really cleared a mile at each step.    \"I like that, my fine fellow,\" said Matthias. \"Come, would you not  like to travel with us?\"'    \"Why not?\" replied he. \"I'll come.\"    So they proceeded on their way together. While passing through a  forest they saw a man placing trunks of trees one upon another.    \"What are you trying to do there?\" asked Matthias, addressing him.    \"I have _Eyes of Flame_,\" said he, \"and I am building a pile here.\" So  saying he fixed his flaming eyes upon the wood, and the whole was  instantly set alight.    \"You are a very clever and powerful man,\" said Matthias, \"would you  like to join our party?\"    \"All right, I am willing.\"    So the four travelled along together. Matthias was overjoyed to have  met with such gifted companions, and paid their expenses generously,  without complaining of the enormous sum of money he had to spend on  the amount of food Broad consumed.    After some days they reached the princess's palace. Matthias had told  them the object of his journey, and had promised each a large reward  if he was successful. They gave him their word to work with a will at  the task which every one up till then had failed to accomplish. The  prince bought them each a handsome suit of clothes, and when they were  all presentable sent them to tell the king, the princess's father,  that he had come with his attendants to watch three nights in the  lady's boudoir. But he took very good care not to say who he was, nor  whence he had come.    The king received them kindly, and after hearing their request said:  \"Reflect well before engaging yourselves in this, for if the princess  should escape you will have to die.\"    \"We very much doubt her escaping from us,\" they replied, \"but come  what will, we intend to make the attempt and to begin at once.\"    \"My duty was to warn you,\" replied the monarch, smiling, \"but if you  still persist in your resolution I myself will take you to the lady's  apartments.\"    [Illustration]    Matthias was dazzled at the loveliness of the royal maiden, while she,  on her side, received the brilliant and handsome young man most  graciously, not trying to hide how much she liked his good looks and  gentle manner. Hardly had the king retired when Broad lay down across  the threshold; Tall and the Man with Eyes of Flame placed themselves  near the window; while Matthias talked with the princess, and watched  her every movement attentively.    Suddenly she ceased to speak, then after a few moments said, \"I feel  as if a shower of poppies were falling on my eyelids.\"    And she lay down on the couch, pretending to sleep.    Matthias did not breathe a word. Seeing her asleep he sat down at a  table near the sofa, leaned his elbows upon it, and rested his chin in  the hollow of his hands. Gradually he felt drowsy and his eyes closed,  as did those of his companions.    Now this was the moment the princess was waiting for. Quickly changing  herself into a dove, she flew towards the window. If it had not  happened that one of her wings touched Tall's hair he would not have  awakened, and he would certainly never have succeeded in catching her  if it had not been for the Man with Eyes of Flame, for he, as soon as  he knew which direction she had taken, sent such a glance after her,  that is, a flame of fire, that in the twinkling of an eye her wings  were burnt, and having been thus stopped, she was obliged to perch on  the top of a tree. From thence Tall reached her easily, and placed her  in Matthias' hands, where she became a princess again. Matthias had  hardly awakened out of his sleep.    Next morning and the morning after the king was greatly astonished to  find his daughter sitting by the prince's side, but he was obliged to  keep silent and accept facts as they were, at the same time  entertaining his guests royally. At the approach of the third night he  spoke with his daughter, and begged her to practise all the magic of  which she was capable, and to act in such a way as to free him from  the presence of intruders of whom he knew neither the rank nor the  fortune.    As for Matthias, he used every means in his power to bring about a  happy ending to such a hitherto successful undertaking. Before  entering the princess's apartments he took his comrades aside and  said, \"There is but one more stroke of luck, dear friends, and then we  have succeeded. If we fail, do not forget that our four heads will  roll on the scaffold.\"    \"Come along,\" replied the three; \"never fear, we shall be able to keep  good watch.\"    When they came into the princess's room they hastened to take up their  positions, and Matthias sat down facing the lady. He would have much  preferred to remain with her without being obliged to keep watch all  the time for fear of losing her for ever. Resolving not to sleep this  time, he said to himself, \"Now I will keep watch upon you, but when  you are my wife I will rest.\"    At midnight, when sleep was beginning to overpower her watchers, the  princess kept silence, and, stretching herself on the couch, shut her  beautiful eyes as if she were really asleep.    Matthias, his elbows on the table, his chin in the palms of his hand,  his eyes fixed upon her, admired her silently. But as sleep closes  even the eyes of the eagle, so it shut those of the prince and his  companions.    The princess, who all this time had been watching them narrowly and  only waiting for this moment, got up from her seat, and changing  herself into a little fly, flew out of the window. Once free, she  again changed herself into a fish, and falling into the palace well,  plunged and hid herself in the depths of the water.    She would certainly have made her escape if, as a fly, she had not  just touched the tip of the nose of the Man with Eyes of Flame. He  sneezed, and opened his eyes in time to notice the direction in which  she had disappeared.

The same  agent can propel the harvesters and work the threshing machines. Even  farmers who till fields of no great extent find it desirable to do much  of their work by steam-engines, for the reason that fuel is less costly  than horse feed. An interesting instance to show how far mechanical  inventions have taken the place of horsed wagons in the work of  civilized communities was afforded by the horse distemper which swept  over the country in 1872. During the week or more in which this epidemic  was at the worst, the State of Massachusetts was practically unhorsed,  yet the greater part of the necessary business, that required to bring  provisions to the town, was effected by means of the railways. The same  incident shows, however, in another way, how absolutely necessary this  animal is, in certain parts of our work. For the great Boston fire,  which occurred at that time, was doubtless due to the fact that, owing  to the sickness of the horses, an effort was made to drag the engines by  hand-power, with the result that they came upon the ground so slowly as  to give the fire a chance to become an uncontrollable conflagration.    In the present state of our arts there is one great occupation which we  cannot conceive to be carried on without the services of horses. This is  war. It is hardly too much to say that all our highly elaborated  military system has depended for its development, as it does for its  maintenance, on the transportation value of horses. Much has been said  of late as to the use of bicycles as adjuncts to armies, and in a  certain limited way they will doubtless prove serviceable in future  campaigns; but no one who has had any experience of military duty, with  its work across tilled fields and through forests, can imagine a man on  a wheel rendering any very effective service except under peculiar  conditions. Moreover, no ordnance corps can do its appointed work in the  rear of a line of battle without sending its wagons across country and  over ground which no unhorsed vehicle could traverse.    The mark of the old utility of the animal in varied employment is  retained in our use of the term horse-power in measuring the energy of  engines. That gauge of strength of old determined what man could do in  the severest taxes upon the forces at his command. In attaining the  point where, owing to the possession of horses, he could use this  standard, he won a great way beyond the station of his ancestors, who  had but the strength of men at their command. Modern invention, by  giving us heat-engines, has made the way for an advance. In another  century, or even in another generation, the horse may, save for the uses  of war, be confined to the position of a luxury and an ornament.

It is not too much to say that the opportunity to go forward on the  paths of culture, at least the chance to advance any considerable  distance beyond the estate of primitive men, depends in a considerable  measure upon what the wilderness may offer in the way of domesticable  beasts of burden. Where such exist we find that the folk who dwell with  them in any land are almost certain to have made great advances. Where  the surrounding nature, however rich, denies this boon, we find that  men, however great their natural abilities may appear to be, exhibit a  retarded development. Thus in North America, where there was no  domesticable beast of burden, the Indians, though an able folk, remain  savages. So, too, in central and southern Africa, where the mammalian  life, though rich, affords no large forms which tolerate captivity, the  people have failed to attain any considerable culture. On the other  hand, in the great continent of the Old World, where the horse, the ass,  the buffalo, the camel, and the elephant existed in the primitive wilds,  men rose swiftly toward the civilized station.    [Illustration: Domesticated Buffaloes in Egypt]    The immediate effect arising from the possession of beasts of burden is  greatly to enlarge the scope and educative value of human labor. A  primitive agriculture, sufficient to provide for the needs of a people,  can be carried on by man's labor alone, though the resulting food-supply  has generally to be supplemented by the chase. Rarely, if ever, are the  products of the soil thus won sufficient in quantity to be made the  basis of any commerce. Such conveyance as is necessary among the people  who are served by their own hands alone, has to be accomplished by boat  transportation or by the backs of men. The immediate effect of using  beasts for burden is the introduction of some kind of plough, which  spares the labor of men in delving the ground, and the use of pack  animals, which, employed in the manner of caravans, greatly promotes the  extension of trade. A great range of secondary influences is found in  the development of the arts of war, by which people who have become  provided with pack or saddle animals are able to prevail over their  savage neighbors, and thus to extend the realm of a nascent  civilization. Yet another influence, arising from the domestication of  large beasts, arises from the fact that these creatures are important  storehouses of food; their flesh spares men the labor of the chase, and  so promotes those regularities of employment which lead men into  civilized ways of life. In fact, by making these creatures captive, men  unintentionally brought themselves out of their ancient savagery. They  were led into systematic and forethoughtful courses, and thus found a  training which they could in no other way have secured.    [Illustration: Cattle of India]    The first and simplest use made of the animals from which man derives  strength appears to have been brought about by the subjugation of wild  cattle--the bulls and buffaloes. Several wild varieties of the bovine  tribe were originally widely disseminated in Europe and Asia, and these  forms must have been frequent objects of chase by the ancient hunters.  Although in their adult state these animals were doubtless originally  intractable, the young were mild-mannered, and, as we can readily  conceive, must often have been led captive to the abodes of the  primitive people. As is common with all gregarious animals which have  long acknowledged the authority of their natural herdsmen, the dominant  males of their tribe, these creatures lent themselves to domestication.  Even the first generation of the captives reared by hand probably showed  a disposition to remain with their masters; and in a few generations  this native impulse might well have been so far developed that the  domestic herd was established, affording perhaps at first only flesh and  hides, and leading the people who made them captives to a nomadic  life--that constant search for fresh fields and pastures new which  characterizes people who are supported by their flocks and herds.    It is a curious fact that the kindred of the buffaloes and bisons  differ exceedingly in the measure of their domesticability. Thus, the  ordinary buffalo of Asia, though a dull brute, is very subjugable,  even in the literal sense, for he makes a tolerable beast for the  plough and bears the yoke with due patience. His African kinsman, on  the other hand, is perhaps the most unconquerable of all the large  wild animals. The late Sir Samuel Baker, in answer to my question as  to what wild form was the most to be feared in combat, unhesitatingly  answered, \"The African buffalo, the bulls of which charge home upon  any aggressor with an immediate and determined fury, which often  enables them to kill the hunter after they have been shot through the  brain.\" Our American bison, though a much milder-spirited beast, seems  also to be essentially undomesticable for the reason that he cannot be  taught to subordinate his desires to the will of man. He can readily  be brought to the point where he will tolerate captivity; but if, when  engaged in ploughing, it occurs to him that he needs water, he will  straightway go in search of it, not in a vicious, but in a perfectly  obdurate manner. This quality of mind appears to be accountable for  the failure of the many experiments which have been made to  domesticate this interesting American form.    The limitations of the domesticating work, the fact that as between  two kindred species the one has been chosen by man and the other left,  indicate the truth--which is generally of much importance--that the  intellectual qualities of animals commonly differ more than their  frames. This is a part of the larger fact that with the advance in  organization the individuality, as regards the whole spiritual field  in persons and species alike, becomes greater. The culmination of the  tendency is seen in man, where, with bodies which do not vary much, we  have an almost infinite range in individual qualities.    This is perhaps a good place in which to make answer to the suggestion  that the domesticability of the animal species is in inverse  proportion to their native courage and independence of mind. The  reader will see how fallacious is this common notion if he will  consider the quality of the supremely domesticated creature, the dog.  There is probably no beast which has a larger share of natural courage  and of independent motive. When not under the control of their  masters, they have perhaps as free a contact with nature"]]]
