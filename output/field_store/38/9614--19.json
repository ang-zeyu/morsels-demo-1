And the hunters hunted  ill: in the warm spring-time hunger came again as though it was still  winter. The tribe might have moved, had they had a leader, but they had  no leader, and none knew where to go that the lion could not follow  them. So the old lion waxed fat and thanked heaven for the kindly race  of men. Two of the children and a youth died while the moon was still  new, and then it was the shrivelled old fire-minder first bethought  herself in a dream of Eudena and Ugh-lomi, and of the way Uya had been  slain. She had lived in fear of Uya all her days, and now she lived in  fear of the lion. That Ugh-lomi could kill Uya for good--Ugh-lomi whom  she had seen born--was impossible. It was Uya still seeking his enemy!    And then came the strange return of Ugh-lomi, a wonderful animal seen  galloping far across the river, that suddenly changed into two animals,  a horse and a man. Following this portent, the vision of Ugh-lomi on the  farther bank of the river.... Yes, it was all plain to her. Uya was  punishing them, because they had not hunted down Ugh-lomi and Eudena.    The men came straggling back to the chances of the night while the sun  was still golden in the sky. They were received with the story of  Ugh-lomi. She went across the river with them and showed them his spoor  hesitating on the farther bank. Siss the Tracker knew the feet for  Ugh-lomi's. \"Uya needs Ugh-lomi,\" cried the old woman, standing on the  left of the bend, a gesticulating figure of flaring bronze in the  sunset. Her cries were strange sounds, flitting to and fro on the  borderland of speech, but this was the sense they carried: \"The lion  needs Eudena. He comes night after night seeking Eudena and Ugh-lomi.  When he cannot find Eudena and Ugh-lomi, he grows angry and he kills.  Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi, Eudena whom he pursued, and Ugh-lomi for whom  he gave the death-word! Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi!\"    She turned to the distant reed-bed, as sometimes she had turned to Uya  in his life. \"Is it not so, my lord?\" she cried. And, as if in answer,  the tall reeds bowed before a breath of wind.    Far into the twilight the sound of hacking was heard from the  squatting-places. It was the men sharpening their ashen spears against  the hunting of the morrow. And in the night, early before the moon  rose, the lion came and took the girl of Siss the Tracker.    In the morning before the sun had risen, Siss the Tracker, and the lad  Wau-Hau, who now chipped flints, and One Eye, and Bo, and the  Snail-eater, the two red-haired men, and Cat's-skin and Snake, all the  men that were left alive of the Sons of Uya, taking their ash spears and  their smiting-stones, and with throwing-stones in the beast-paw bags,  started forth upon the trail of Ugh-lomi through the hawthorn thickets  where Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding, and up the bare  downland towards the beechwoods.    That night the fires burnt high and fierce, as the waxing moon set, and  the lion left the crouching women and children in peace.    And the next day, while the sun was still high, the hunters  returned--all save One Eye, who lay dead with a smashed skull at the  foot of the ledge. (When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from stalking  the horses, he found the vultures already busy over him.) And with them  the hunters brought Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had been  the strange order of the shrivelled old woman, that she was to be  brought alive--\"She is no kill for us. She is for Uya the Lion.\" Her  hands were tied with thongs, as though she had been a man, and she came  weary and drooping--her hair over her eyes and matted with blood. They  walked about her, and ever and again the Snail-eater, whose name she had  given, would laugh and strike her with his ashen spear. And after he had  struck her with his spear, he would look over his shoulder like one who  had done an over-bold deed. The others, too, looked over their shoulders  ever and again, and all were in a hurry save Eudena. When the old woman  saw them coming, she cried aloud with joy.    They made Eudena cross the river with her hands tied, although the  current was strong and when she slipped the old woman screamed, first  with joy and then for fear she might be drowned. And when they had  dragged Eudena to shore, she could not stand for a time, albeit they  beat her sore. So they let her sit with her feet touching the water, and  her eyes staring before her, and her face set, whatever they might do or  say. All the tribe came down to the squatting-place, even curly little  Haha, who as yet could scarcely toddle, and stood staring at Eudena and  the old woman, as now we should stare at some strange wounded beast and  its captor.    The old woman tore off the necklace of Uya that was about Eudena's neck,  and put it on herself--she had been the first to wear it. Then she tore  at Eudena's hair, and took a spear from Siss and beat her with all her  might. And when she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl she  looked closely into her face. Eudena's eyes were closed and her features  were set, and she lay so still that for a moment the old woman feared  she was dead. And then her nostrils quivered. At that the old woman  slapped her face and laughed and gave the spear to Siss again, and went  a little way off from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her  manner.    The old woman had more words than any in the tribe. And her talk was a  terrible thing to hear. Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently,  and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of  thoughts. But she conveyed to Eudena, nevertheless, much of the things  that were yet to come, of the Lion and of the torment he would do her.  \"And Ugh-lomi! Ha, ha! Ugh-lomi is slain?\"    And suddenly Eudena's eyes opened and she sat up again, and her look met  the old woman's fair and level. \"No,\" she said slowly, like one trying  to remember, \"I did not see my Ugh-lomi slain. I did not see my Ugh-lomi  slain.\"    \"Tell her,\" cried the old woman. \"Tell her--he that killed him. Tell her  how Ugh-lomi was slain.\"    She looked, and all the women and children there looked, from man to  man.    None answered her. They stood shame-faced.    \"Tell her,\" said the old woman. The men looked at one another.    Eudena's face suddenly lit.    \"Tell her,\" she said. \"Tell her, mighty men! Tell her the killing of  Ugh-lomi.\"    The old woman rose and struck her sharply across her mouth.    \"We could not find Ugh-lomi,\" said Siss the Tracker, slowly. \"Who hunts  two, kills none.\"    Then Eudena's heart leapt, but she kept her face hard. It was as well,  for the old woman looked at her sharply, with murder in her eyes.    Then the old woman turned her tongue upon the men because they had  feared to go on after Ugh-lomi. She dreaded no one now Uya was slain.  She scolded them as one scolds children. And they scowled at her, and  began to accuse one another. Until suddenly Siss the Tracker raised his  voice and bade her hold her peace.    And so when the sun was setting they took Eudena and went--though their  hearts sank within them--along the trail the old lion had made in the  reeds. All the men went together. At one place was a group of alders,  and here they hastily bound Eudena where the lion might find her when he  came abroad in the twilight, and having done so they hurried back until  they were near the squatting-place. Then they stopped. Siss stopped  first and looked back again at the alders. They could see her head even  from the squatting-place, a little black shock under the limb of the  larger tree. That was as well.    All the women and children stood watching upon the crest of the mound.  And the old woman stood and screamed for the lion to take her whom he  sought, and counselled him on the torments he might do her.    Eudena was very weary now, stunned by beatings and fatigue and sorrow,  and only the fear of the thing that was still to come upheld her. The  sun was broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant chestnuts,  and the west was all on fire; the evening breeze had died to a warm  tranquillity. The air was full of midge swarms, the fish in the river  hard by would leap at times, and now and again a cockchafer would drone  through the air. Out of the corner of her eye Eudena could see a part of  the squatting-knoll, and little figures standing and staring at her.  And--a very little sound but very clear--she could hear the beating of  the firestone. Dark and near to her and still was the reed-fringed  thicket of the lair.    Presently the firestone ceased. She looked for the sun and found he had  gone, and overhead and growing brighter was the waxing moon. She looked  towards the thicket of the lair, seeking shapes in the reeds, and then  suddenly she began to wriggle and wriggle, weeping and calling upon  Ugh-lomi.    But Ugh-lomi was far away. When they saw her head moving with her  struggles, they shouted together on the knoll, and she desisted and was  still. And then came the bats, and the star that was like Ugh-lomi crept  out of its blue hiding-place in the west. She called to it, but softly,  because she feared the lion. And all through the coming of the twilight  the thicket was still.    So the dark crept upon Eudena, and the moon grew bright, and the shadows  of things that had fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening  came back to them short and black. And the dark shapes in the thicket of  reeds and alders where the lion lay, gathered, and a faint stir began  there. But nothing came out therefrom all through the gathering of the  darkness.    She looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires glowing smoky-red,  and the men and women going to and fro. The other way, over the river, a  white mist was rising. Then far away came the whimpering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#16)"],[1,"to the conclusion  that our satellite must be revolving in a nearly circular path around  the earth at the centre. It can, indeed, be shown that the constant  distance of the two bodies involves as a necessary condition the  revolution of the moon around the earth. The attraction between the moon  and the earth tends to bring the two bodies together. The only way by  which such a catastrophe can be permanently avoided is by making the  satellite move as we actually find it to do. The attraction between the  earth and the moon still exists, but its effect is not then shown in  bringing the moon in towards the earth. The attraction has now to exert  its whole power in restraining the moon in its circular path; were the  attraction to cease, the moon would start off in a straight line, and  recede never to return.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--The Moon's Path around the Sun.]    The fact of the moon's revolution around the earth is easily  demonstrated by observations of the stars. The rising and setting of our  satellite is, of course, due to the rotation of the earth, and this  apparent diurnal movement the moon possesses in common with the sun and  with the stars. It will, however, be noticed that the moon is  continually changing its place among the stars. Even in the course of a  single night the displacement will be conspicuous to a careful observer  without the aid of a telescope. The moon completes each revolution  around the earth in a period of 27.3 days.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--The Phases of the Moon.]    In Fig. 24 we have a view of the relative positions of the earth, the  sun, and the moon, but it is to be observed that, for the convenience of  illustration, we have been obliged to represent the orbit of the moon on  a much larger scale than it ought to be in comparison with the distance  of the sun. That half of the moon which is turned towards the sun is  brilliantly illuminated, and, according as we see more or less of that  brilliant half, we say that the moon is more or less full, the several  \"phases\" being visible in the succession shown by the numbers in Fig.  25. A beginner sometimes finds considerable difficulty in understanding  how the light on the full moon at night can have been derived from the  sun. \"Is not,\" he will say, \"the earth in the way? and must it not  intercept the sunlight from every object on the other side of the earth  to the sun?\" A study of Fig. 24 will explain the difficulty. The plane  in which the moon revolves does not coincide with the plane in which the  earth revolves around the sun. The line in which the plane of the  earth's motion is intersected by that of the moon divides the moon's  path into two semicircles. We must imagine the moon's path to be tilted  a little, so that the upper semicircle is somewhat above the plane of  the paper, and the other semicircle below. It thus follows that when the  moon is in the position marked full, under the circumstances shown in  the figure, the moon will be just above the line joining the earth and  the sun; the sunlight will thus pass over the earth to the moon, and the  moon will be illuminated. At new moon, the moon will be under the line  joining the earth and the sun.    As the relative positions of the earth and the sun are changing, it  happens twice in each revolution that the sun comes into the position of  the line of intersection of the two planes. If this occurs at the time  of full moon, the earth lies directly between the moon and the sun; the  moon is thus plunged into the shadow of the earth, the light from the  sun is intercepted, and we say that the moon is eclipsed. The moon  sometimes only partially enters the earth's shadow, in which case the  eclipse is a partial one. When, on the other hand, the sun is situated  on the line of intersection at the time of new moon, the moon lies  directly between the earth and the sun, and the dark body of the moon  will then cut off the sunlight from the earth, producing a solar  eclipse. Usually only a part of the sun is thus obscured, forming the  well-known partial eclipse; if, however, the moon pass centrally over  the sun, then we must have one or other of two very remarkable kinds of  eclipse. Sometimes the moon entirely blots out the sun, and thus is  produced the sublime spectacle of a total eclipse, which tells us so  much as to the nature of the sun, and to which we have already referred  in the last chapter. Even when the moon is placed centrally over the  sun, a thin rim of sunlight is occasionally seen round the margin of the  moon. We then have what is known as an annular eclipse.    It is remarkable that the moon is sometimes able to hide the sun  completely, while on other occasions it fails to do so. It happens that  the average apparent size of the moon is nearly equal to the average  apparent size of the sun, but, owing to the fluctuations in their  distances, the actual apparent sizes of both bodies undergo certain  changes. On certain occasions the apparent size of the moon is greater  than that of the sun. In this case a central passage produces a total  eclipse; but it may also happen that the apparent size of the sun  exceeds that of the moon, in which case a central passage can only  produce an annular eclipse.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Form of the Earth's Shadow, showing the  Penumbra, or partially shaded region. Within the Penumbra, the Moon is  visible; in the Shadow it is nearly invisible.]    There are hardly any more interesting celestial phenomena than the  different descriptions of eclipses. The almanac will always give timely  notice of the occurrence, and the more striking features can be observed  without a telescope. In an eclipse of the moon (Fig. 26) it is  interesting to note the moment when the black shadow is first detected,  to watch its gradual encroachment over the bright surface of the moon,  to follow it, in case the eclipse is total, until there is only a thin  crescent of moonlight left, and to watch the final extinction of that  crescent when the whole moon is plunged into the shadow. But now a  spectacle of great interest and beauty is often manifested; for though  the moon is so hidden behind the earth that not a single direct ray of  the sunlight could reach its surface, yet we often find that the moon  remains visible, and, indeed, actually glows with a copper-coloured hue  bright enough to permit several of the markings on the surface to be  discerned.    This illumination of the moon even in the depth of a total eclipse is  due to the sunbeams which have just grazed the edge of the earth. In  doing so they have become bent by the refraction of the atmosphere, and  have thus been turned inwards into the shadow. Such beams have passed  through a prodigious thickness of the earth's atmosphere, and in this  long journey through hundreds of miles of air they have become tinged  with a ruddy or copper-like hue. Nor is this property of our atmosphere  an unfamiliar one. The sun both at sunrise and at sunset glows with a  light which is much more ruddy than the beams it dispenses at noonday.  But at sunset or at sunrise the rays which reach our eyes have much more  of our atmosphere to penetrate than they have at noon, and accordingly  the atmosphere imparts to them that ruddy colour so characteristic and  often so lovely. If the spectrum of the sun when close to the horizon is  examined it is seen to be filled with numerous dark lines and bands  situated chiefly towards the blue and violet end. These are caused by  the increased absorption which the light suffers in the atmosphere, and  give rise to the preponderating red light on the sun under such  conditions. In the case of the eclipsed moon, the sunbeams have to take  an atmospheric journey more than double as long as that at sunrise or  sunset, and hence the ruddy glow of the eclipsed moon may be accounted  for.    The almanacs give the full particulars of each eclipse that happens in  the corresponding year. These predictions are reliable, because  astronomers have been carefully observing the moon for ages, and have  learned from these observations not only how the moon moves at present,  but also how it will move for ages to come. The actual calculations are  so complicated that we cannot here discuss them. There is, however, one  leading principle about eclipses which is so simple that we must refer  to it. The eclipses occurring this year have no very obvious relation  to the eclipses that occurred last year, or to those that will occur  next year. Yet, when we take a more extended view of the sequence of  these phenomena, a very definite principle becomes manifest. If we  observe all the eclipses in a period of eighteen years, or nineteen  years, then we can predict, with at least an approximation to the truth,  all the future eclipses for many years. It is only necessary to  recollect that in 6,585-1/3 days after one eclipse a nearly similar  eclipse follows. For instance, a beautiful eclipse of the moon occurred  on the 5th of December, 1881. If we count back 6,585 days from that  date, or, that is, eighteen years and eleven days, we come to November  24th, 1863, and a similar eclipse of the moon took place then. Again,  there were four eclipses in the year 1881. If we add 6,585-1/3 days to  the date of each eclipse, it will give the dates of all the four  eclipses in the year 1899. It was this rule which enabled the ancient  astronomers to predict the recurrence of eclipses, at a time when the  motions of the moon were not understood nearly so well as they now are.    During a long voyage, and perhaps in critical circumstances, the moon  will often render invaluable information to the sailor. To navigate a  ship, suppose from Liverpool to China, the captain must frequently  determine the precise position which his ship then occupies. If he could  not do this, he would never find his way across the trackless ocean.  Observations of the sun give "]]]
