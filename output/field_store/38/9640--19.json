Mrs. Osmond, at present, might well have gratified such  tastes. The years had touched her only to enrich her; the flower of her  youth had not faded, it only hung more quietly on its stem. She had lost  something of that quick eagerness to which her husband had privately  taken exception--she had more the air of being able to wait. Now, at all  events, framed in the gilded doorway, she struck our young man as the  picture of a gracious lady. \"You see I'm very regular,\" he said. \"But  who should be if I'm not?\"    \"Yes, I've known you longer than any one here. But we mustn't indulge in  tender reminiscences. I want to introduce you to a young lady.\"    \"Ah, please, what young lady?\" Rosier was immensely obliging; but this  was not what he had come for.    \"She sits there by the fire in pink and has no one to speak to.\" Rosier  hesitated a moment. \"Can't Mr. Osmond speak to her? He's within six feet  of her.\"    Mrs. Osmond also hesitated. \"She's not very lively, and he doesn't like  dull people.\"    \"But she's good enough for me? Ah now, that's hard!\"    \"I only mean that you've ideas for two. And then you're so obliging.\"    \"No, he's not--to me.\" And Mrs. Osmond vaguely smiled.    \"That's a sign he should be doubly so to other women.    \"So I tell him,\" she said, still smiling.    \"You see I want some tea,\" Rosier went on, looking wistfully beyond.    \"That's perfect. Go and give some to my young lady.\"    \"Very good; but after that I'll abandon her to her fate. The simple  truth is I'm dying to have a little talk with Miss Osmond.\"    \"Ah,\" said Isabel, turning away, \"I can't help you there!\"    Five minutes later, while he handed a tea-cup to the damsel in pink,  whom he had conducted into the other room, he wondered whether, in  making to Mrs. Osmond the profession I have just quoted, he had broken  the spirit of his promise to Madame Merle. Such a question was capable  of occupying this young man's mind for a considerable time. At last,  however, he became--comparatively speaking--reckless; he cared little  what promises he might break. The fate to which he had threatened to  abandon the damsel in pink proved to be none so terrible; for Pansy  Osmond, who had given him the tea for his companion--Pansy was as fond  as ever of making tea--presently came and talked to her. Into this mild  colloquy Edward Rosier entered little; he sat by moodily, watching his  small sweetheart. If we look at her now through his eyes we shall at  first not see much to remind us of the obedient little girl who, at  Florence, three years before, was sent to walk short distances in the  Cascine while her father and Miss Archer talked together of matters  sacred to elder people. But after a moment we shall perceive that if at  nineteen Pansy has become a young lady she doesn't really fill out the  part; that if she has grown very pretty she lacks in a deplorable degree  the quality known and esteemed in the appearance of females as style;  and that if she is dressed with great freshness she wears her smart  attire with an undisguised appearance of saving it--very much as if it  were lent her for the occasion. Edward Rosier, it would seem, would have  been just the man to note these defects; and in point of fact there was  not a quality of this young lady, of any sort, that he had not noted.  Only he called her qualities by names of his own--some of which indeed  were happy enough. \"No, she's unique--she's absolutely unique,\" he used  to say to himself; and you may be sure that not for an instant would he  have admitted to you that she was wanting in style. Style? Why, she had  the style of a little princess; if you couldn't see it you had no eye.  It was not modern, it was not conscious, it would produce no impression  in Broadway; the small, serious damsel, in her stiff little dress, only  looked like an Infanta of Velasquez. This was enough for Edward Rosier,  who thought her delightfully old-fashioned. Her anxious eyes, her  charming lips, her slip of a figure, were as touching as a childish  prayer. He had now an acute desire to know just to what point she liked  him--a desire which made him fidget as he sat in his chair. It made him  feel hot, so that he had to pat his forehead with his handkerchief; he  had never been so uncomfortable. She was such a perfect jeune fille, and  one couldn't make of a jeune fille the enquiry requisite for throwing  light on such a point. A jeune fille was what Rosier had always dreamed  of--a jeune fille who should yet not be French, for he had felt that  this nationality would complicate the question. He was sure Pansy had  never looked at a newspaper and that, in the way of novels, if she  had read Sir Walter Scott it was the very most. An American jeune  fille--what could be better than that? She would be frank and gay, and  yet would not have walked alone, nor have received letters from men,  nor have been taken to the theatre to see the comedy of manners. Rosier  could not deny that, as the matter stood, it would be a breach of  hospitality to appeal directly to this unsophisticated creature; but  he was now in imminent danger of asking himself if hospitality were  the most sacred thing in the world. Was not the sentiment that he  entertained for Miss Osmond of infinitely greater importance? Of greater  importance to him--yes; but not probably to the master of the house.  There was one comfort; even if this gentleman had been placed on his  guard by Madame Merle he would not have extended the warning to Pansy;  it would not have been part of his policy to let her know that a  prepossessing young man was in love with her. But he WAS in love  with her, the prepossessing young man; and all these restrictions of  circumstance had ended by irritating him. What had Gilbert Osmond meant  by giving him two fingers of his left hand? If Osmond was rude, surely  he himself might be bold. He felt extremely bold after the dull girl  in so vain a disguise of rose-colour had responded to the call of her  mother, who came in to say, with a significant simper at Rosier, that  she must carry her off to other triumphs. The mother and daughter  departed together, and now it depended only upon him that he should be  virtually alone with Pansy. He had never been alone with her before;  he had never been alone with a jeune fille. It was a great moment; poor  Rosier began to pat his forehead again. There was another room beyond  the one in which they stood--a small room that had been thrown open and  lighted, but that, the company not being numerous, had remained empty  all the evening. It was empty yet; it was upholstered in pale yellow;  there were several lamps; through the open door it looked the very  temple of authorised love. Rosier gazed a moment through this aperture;  he was afraid that Pansy would run away, and felt almost capable of  stretching out a hand to detain her. But she lingered where the other  maiden had left them, making no motion to join a knot of visitors on  the far side of the room. For a little it occurred to him that she was  frightened--too frightened perhaps to move; but a second glance assured  him she was not, and he then reflected that she was too innocent indeed  for that. After a supreme hesitation he asked her if he might go and  look at the yellow room, which seemed so attractive yet so virginal. He  had been there already with Osmond, to inspect the furniture, which was  of the First French Empire, and especially to admire the clock (which he  didn't really admire), an immense classic structure of that period. He  therefore felt that he had now begun to manoeuvre.    \"Certainly, you may go,\" said Pansy; \"and if you like I'll show you.\"  She was not in the least frightened.    \"That's just what I hoped you'd say; you're so very kind,\" Rosier  murmured.    They went in together; Rosier really thought the room very ugly, and it  seemed cold. The same idea appeared to have struck Pansy. \"It's not for  winter evenings; it's more for summer,\" she said. \"It's papa's taste; he  has so much.\"    He had a good deal, Rosier thought; but some of it was very bad. He  looked about him; he hardly knew what to say in such a situation.  \"Doesn't Mrs. Osmond care how her rooms are done? Has she no taste?\" he  asked.    \"Oh yes, a great deal; but it's more for literature,\" said Pansy--\"and  for conversation. But papa cares also for those things. I think he knows  everything.\"    Rosier was silent a little. \"There's one thing I'm sure he knows!\" he  broke out presently. \"He knows that when I come here it's, with all  respect to him, with all respect to Mrs. Osmond, who's so charming--it's  really,\" said the young man, \"to see you!\"    \"To see me?\" And Pansy raised her vaguely troubled eyes.    \"To see you; that's what I come for,\" Rosier repeated, feeling the  intoxication of a rupture with authority.    Pansy stood looking at him, simply, intently, openly; a blush was not  needed to make her face more modest. \"I thought it was for that.\"    \"And it was not disagreeable to you?\"    \"I couldn't tell; I didn't know. You never told me,\" said Pansy.    \"I was afraid of offending you.\"    \"You don't offend me,\" the young girl murmured, smiling as if an angel  had kissed her.    \"You like me then, Pansy?\" Rosier asked very gently, feeling very happy.    \"Yes--I like you.\"    They had walked to the chimney-piece where the big cold Empire clock  was perched; they were well within the room and beyond observation from  without. The tone in which she had said these four words seemed to him  the very breath of nature, and his only answer could be to take her  hand and hold it a moment. Then he raised it to his lips. She submitted,  still with her pure, trusting smile, in which there was something  ineffably passive. She liked him--she had liked him all the while; now  anything might "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#16)"],[1,"of lizard-blasting in a training chamber made him  proficient in the exact procedure.           *       *       *       *       *    Jason left the sealed buildings quietly and no one saw him go. He  followed the map to the nearest barracks, shuffling tiredly through the  dusty streets. It was a hot, quiet afternoon, broken only by rumblings  from the distance, and the occasional crack of his gun.    It was cool inside the thick-walled barracks buildings, and he collapsed  onto a bench until the sweat dried and his heart stopped pounding. Then  he went to the nearest recreation room to start his search.    Before it began it was finished. None of the Pyrrans kept old artifacts  of any kind and thought the whole idea was very funny. After the  twentieth negative answer Jason was ready to admit defeat in this line  of investigation. There was as much chance of meeting a Pyrran with old  documents as finding a bundle of grandfather's letters in a soldier's  kit bag.    This left a single possibility--verbal histories. Again Jason questioned  with the same lack of results. The fun had worn off the game for the  Pyrrans and they were beginning to growl. Jason stopped while he was  still in one piece. The commissary served him a meal that tasted like  plastic paste and wood pulp. He ate it quickly, then sat brooding over  the empty tray, hating to admit to another dead end. Who could supply  him with answers? All the people he had talked to were so young. They  had no interest or patience for story-telling. That was an old folks'  hobby--and there were no oldsters on Pyrrus.    With one exception that he knew of, the librarian, Poli. It was a  possibility. A man who worked with records and books might have an  interest in some of the older ones. He might even remember reading  volumes now destroyed. A very slim lead indeed, but one that had to be  pursued.    Walking to the library almost killed Jason. The torrential rains made  the footing bad, and in the dim light it was hard to see what was  coming. A snapper came in close enough to take out a chunk of flesh  before he could blast it. The antitoxin made him dizzy and he lost some  blood before he could get the wound dressed. He reached the library,  exhausted and angry.    Poli was working on the guts of one of the catalogue machines. He didn't  stop until Jason had tapped him on the shoulder. Switching on his  hearing aid, the Pyrran stood quietly, crippled and bent, waiting for  Jason to talk.    \"Have you any old papers or letters that you have kept for your personal  use?\"    A shake of the head, _no_.    \"What about stories--you know, about great things that have happened in  the past, that someone might have told you when you were young?\"  Negative.    Results negative. Every question was answered by a shake of Poli's head,  and very soon the old man grew irritated and pointed to the work he  hadn't finished.    \"Yes, I know you have work to do,\" Jason said. \"But this is important.\"  Poli shook his head an angry _no_ and reached to turn off his hearing  aid. Jason groped for a question that might get a more positive answer.  There was something tugging at his mind, a word he had heard and made a  note of, to be investigated later. Something that Kerk had said ...    \"That's it!\" It was right there--on the tip of his tongue. \"Just a  second, Poli, just one more question. What is a 'grubber'? Have you ever  seen one or know what they do, or where they can be found--\"    The words were cut off as Poli whirled and lashed the back of his good  arm into Jason's face. Though the man was aged and crippled, the blow  almost fractured Jason's jaw, sending him sliding across the floor.  Through a daze he saw Poli hobbling towards him, making thick bubbling  noises in his ruined throat; what remained of his face twisted and  working with anger.    This was no time for diplomacy. Moving as fast as he could, with the  high-G, foot-slapping shuffle, Jason headed for the sealed door. He was  no match for any Pyrran in hand-to-hand combat, young and small or old  and crippled. The door thunked open, as he went through, and barely  closed in Poli's face.    Outside the rain had turned to snow and Jason trudged wearily through  the slush, rubbing his sore jaw and turning over the only fact he had.  _Grubber_ was a key--but to what? And who did he dare ask for more  information? Kerk was the man he had talked to best, but not any more.  That left only Meta as a possible source. He wanted to see her at once,  but sudden exhaustion swept through him. It took all of his strength to  stumble back to the school buildings.           *       *       *       *       *    In the morning he ate and left early. There was only a week left. It was  impossible to hurry and he cursed as he dragged his double-weight body  to the assignment center. Meta was on night perimeter duty and should  be back to her quarters soon. He shuffled over there and was lying on  her bunk when she came in.    \"Get out,\" she said in a flat voice. \"Or do I throw you out?\"    \"Patience, please,\" he said as he sat up. \"Just resting here until you  came back. I have a single question, and if you will answer it for me  I'll go and stop bothering you.\"    \"What is it?\" she asked, tapping her foot with impatience. But there was  also a touch of curiosity in her voice. Jason thought carefully before  he spoke.    \"Now _please_, don't shoot me. You know I'm an off-worlder with a big  mouth, and you have heard me say some awful things without taking a shot  at me. Now I have another one. Will you please show your superiority to  the other people of the galaxy by holding your temper and not reducing  me to component atoms?\"    His only answer was a tap of the foot, so he took a deep breath and  plunged in.    \"What is a 'grubber'?\"    For a long moment she was quiet, unmoving. Then she curled her lips back  in disgust. \"You find the most repulsive topics.\"    \"That may be so,\" he said, \"but it still doesn't answer my question.\"    \"It's ... well, the sort of thing people just don't talk about.\"    \"I do,\" he assured her.    \"Well, I _don't_! It's the most disgusting thing in the world, and  that's all I'm going to say. Talk to Krannon, but not to me.\" She had  him by the arm while she talked and he was half dragged to the hall. The  door slammed behind him and he muttered \"_lady wrestler_\" under his  breath. His anger ebbed away as he realized that she had given him a  clue in spite of herself. Next step, find out who or what Krannon was.    Assignment center listed a man named Krannon, and gave his shift number  and work location. It was close by and Jason walked there. A large,  cubical, and windowless building, with the single word _food_ next to  each of the sealed entrances. The small entrance he went through was a  series of automatic chambers that cycled him through ultrasonics,  ultraviolet, antibio spray, rotating brushes and three final rinses. He  was finally admitted, damper but much cleaner to the central area. Men  and robots were stacking crates and he asked one of the men for Krannon.  The man looked him up and down coldly and spat on his shoes before  answering.    Krannon worked in a large storage bay by himself. He was a stocky man in  patched coveralls whose only expression was one of intense gloom. When  Jason came in he stopped hauling bales and sat down on the nearest one.  The lines of unhappiness were cut into his face and seemed to grow  deeper while Jason explained what he was after. All the talk of ancient  history on Pyrrus bored him as well and he yawned openly. When Jason  finished he yawned again and didn't even bother to answer him.    [Illustration]    Jason waited a moment, then asked again. \"I said do you have any old  books, papers, records or that sort of thing?\"    \"You sure picked the right guy to bother, off-worlder,\" was his only  answer. \"After talking to me you're going to have nothing but trouble.\"    \"Why is that?\" Jason asked.    \"Why?\" For the first time he was animated with something besides grief.  \"I'll tell you why! I made one mistake, just one, and I get a life  sentence. For life--how would you like that? Just me alone, being by  myself all the time. Even taking orders from the grubbers.\"    Jason controlled himself, keeping the elation out of his voice.  \"Grubbers? What are grubbers?\"    The enormity of the question stopped Krannon, it seemed impossible that  there could be a man alive who had never heard of grubbers. Happiness  lifted some of the gloom from his face as he realized that he had a  captive audience who would listen to his troubles.    \"Grubbers are traitors--that's what they are. Traitors to the human race  and they ought to be wiped out. Living in the jungle. The things they do  with the animals--\"    \"You mean they're people ... Pyrrans like yourself?\" Jason broke in.    \"Not like _me_, mister. Don't make that mistake again if you want to go  on living. Maybe I dozed off on guard once so I got stuck with this job.  That doesn't mean I like it or like them. They stink, really stink, and  if it wasn't for the food we get from them they'd all be dead tomorrow.  That's the kind of killing job I could really put my heart into.\"    \"If they supply you with food, you must give them something in return?\"    \"Trade goods, beads, knives, the usual things. Supply sends them over in  cartons and I take care of the delivery.\"    \"How?\" Jason asked.    \"By armored truck to the delivery site. Then I go back later to pick up  the food they've left in exchange.\"    \"Can I go with you on the next delivery?\"    Krannon frowned over the idea for a minute. \"Yeah, I suppose it's all  right if you're stupid enough to come. You can help me load. They're  between harvests now, so the next trip won't be for eight days--\"    \"But that's after the ship leaves--it'll be too late. Can't you go  earlier?\"    \"Don't tell me your troubles, mister,\" Krannon grumbled, climbing to"]]]
