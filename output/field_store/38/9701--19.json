In one of those  extemporized councils, then,--such as fought the battle of Bunker Hill,  and threw the tea into Boston harbor,--it was determined, at ten  o'clock, to divide the working parties. The larger body should work back  to the Four Corners, and by proper relays keep that trunk line of road  open, if they could; while six yoke, with their owners, still pressing  forward to the station, should make a new base at Lovejoy's, where, when  these oxen gave out, they could be put up at his barn. It was quite  clear, indeed, to the experts that that time was not far distant.    And so, indeed, it proved. By three in the afternoon, John and Reuben  and the other leaders of the advance party--namely, the whole of it, for  such is the custom of New England--gathered around the fire at  Lovejoy's, conscious that after twelve hours of such battle as Pavia  never saw, nor Roncesvalles, they were defeated at every point but one.  Before them the mile of road which they had made in the steady work of  hours was drifted in again as smooth as the surrounding pastures, only  if possible a little more treacherous for the labor which they had  thrown away upon it. The oxen which had worked kindly and patiently,  well handled by good-tempered men, yet all confused and half dead with  exposure, could do no more. Well, indeed, if those that had been stalled  fast, and had had to stand in that biting wind after gigantic effort,  escaped with their lives from such exposure. All that the men had gained  was that they had advanced their first depot of milk--two hundred and  thirty-nine cans--as far as Lovejoy's. What supply might have worked  down to the Four Corners behind them, they did not know and hardly  cared, their communications that way being well-nigh cut off again. What  they thought of, and planned for, was simply how these cans at Lovejoy's  could be put on any downward train. For by this time they knew that all  trains would have lost their grades and their names, and that this milk  would go into Boston by the first engine that went there, though it rode  on the velvet of a palace car.    What train this might be, they did not know. From the hill above  Lovejoy's they could see poor old Dix, the station-master, with his wife  and boys, doing his best to make an appearance of shovelling in front of  his little station. But Dix's best was but little, for he had but one  arm, having lost the other in a collision, and so as a sort of pension  the company had placed him at this little flag-station, where was a roof  over his head, a few tickets to sell, and generally very little else to  do. It was clear enough that no working parties on the railroad had  worked up to Dix, or had worked down; nor was it very likely that any  would before night, unless the railroad people had better luck with  their drifts than our friends had found. But, as to this, who should  say? Snow-drifts are \"mighty onsartain.\" The line of that road is in  general northwest, and to-day's wind might have cleaned out its gorges  as persistently as it had filled up our crosscuts. From Lovejoy's barn  they could see that the track was now perfectly clear for the half mile  where it crossed the Prescott meadows.    I am sorry to have been so long in describing thus the aspect of the  field after the first engagement. But it was on this condition of  affairs that, after full conference, the enterprises of the night were  determined. Whatever was to be done was to be done by men. And after  thorough regale on Mrs. Lovejoy's green tea, and continual return to her  constant relays of thin bacon gilded by unnumbered eggs; after cutting  and coming again upon unnumbered mince-pies, which, I am sorry to say,  did not in any point compare well with Huldah's,--each man thrust many  doughnuts into his outside pockets, drew on the long boots again, and  his buckskin gloves and mittens, and, unencumbered now by the care of  animals, started on the work of the evening. The sun was just taking his  last look at them from the western hills, where Reuben and John could  see Huldah's chimney smoking. The plan was, by taking a double hand-sled  of Lovejoy's, and by knocking together two or three more,  jumper-fashion, to work their way across the meadow to the railroad  causeway, and establish a milk depot there, where the line was not half  a mile from Lovejoy's. By going and coming often, following certain  tracks well known to Lovejoy on the windward side of walls and fences,  these eight men felt quite sure that by midnight they could place all  their milk at the spot where the old farm crossing strikes the railroad.  Meanwhile, Silas Lovejoy, a boy of fourteen, was to put on a pair of  snow-shoes, go down to the station, state the case to old Dix, and get  from him a red lantern and permission to stop the first train where it  swept out from the Pitman cut upon the causeway. Old Dix had no more  right to give this permission than had the humblest street-sweeper in  Ispahan, and this they all knew. But the fact that Silas had asked for  it would show a willingness on their part to submit to authority, if  authority there had been. This satisfied the New England love of law, on  the one hand. On the other hand, the train would be stopped, and this  satisfied the New England determination to get the thing done any way.  To give additional force to Silas, John provided him with a note to Dix,  and it was generally agreed that if Dix wasn't ugly, he would give the  red lantern and the permission. Silas was then to work up the road and  station himself as far beyond the curve as he could, and stop the first  down-train. He was to tell the conductor where the men were waiting with  the milk, was to come down to them on the train, and his duty would be  done. Lest Dix should be ugly, Silas was provided with Lovejoy's only  lantern, but he was directed not to show this at the station until his  interview was finished. Silas started cheerfully on his snow-shoes; John  and Lovejoy, at the same time, starting with the first hand-sled of the  cans. First of all into the sled, John put Huldah's well-known can, a  little shorter than the others, and with a different handle. \"Whatever  else went to Boston,\" he said, \"that can was bound to go through.\"    They established the basis of their pyramid, and met the three new  jumpers with their makers as they went back for more. This party  enlarged the base of the pyramid; and, as they worked, Silas passed them  cheerfully with his red lantern. Old Dix had not been ugly, had given  the lantern and all the permission he had to give, and had communicated  some intelligence also. The intelligence was, that an accumulated force  of seven engines, with a large working party, had left Groton Junction  downward at three. Nothing had arrived upward at Groton Junction; and,  from Boston, Dix learned that nothing more would leave there till early  morning. No trains had arrived in Boston from any quarter for  twenty-four hours. So long the blockade had lasted already.    On this intelligence, it was clear that, with good luck, the down-train  might reach them at any moment. Still the men resolved to leave their  milk, while they went back for more, relying on Silas and the \"large  working party\" to put it on the cars, if the train chanced to pass  before any of them returned. So back they fared to Lovejoy's for their  next relay, and met John and Reuben working in successfully with their  second. But no one need have hurried; for, as trip after trip they built  their pyramid of cans higher and higher, no welcome whistle broke the  stillness of the night, and by ten o'clock, when all these cans were in  place by the rail, the train had not yet come.    John and Reuben then proposed to go up into the cut, and to relieve poor  Silas, who had not been heard from since he swung along so cheerfully  like an \"Excelsior\" boy on his way up the Alps. But they had hardly  started, when a horn from the meadow recalled them, and, retracing their  way, they met a messenger who had come in to say that a fresh team from  the Four Corners had been reported at Lovejoy's, with a dozen or more  men, who had succeeded in bringing down nearly as far as Lovejoy's  mowing-lot near a hundred more cans; that it was quite possible in two  or three hours more to bring this over also,--and, although the first  train was probably now close at hand, it was clearly worth while to  place this relief in readiness for a second. So poor Silas was left for  the moment to his loneliness, and Reuben and John returned again upon  their steps. They passed the house where they found Mrs. Lovejoy and  Mrs. Stacy at work in the shed, finishing off two more jumpers, and  claiming congratulation for their skill, and after a cup of tea  again,--for no man touched spirit that day nor that night,--they  reported at the new station by the mowing-lot.    And Silas Lovejoy--who had turned the corner into the Pitman cut, and so  shut himself out from sight of the station light, or his father's  windows, or the lanterns of the party at the pyramid of cans--Silas  Lovejoy held his watch there, hour by hour, with such courage as the  sense of the advance gives boy or man. He had not neglected to take the  indispensable shovel as he came. In going over the causeway he had  slipped off the snow-shoes and hung them on his back. Then there was  heavy wading as he turned into the Pitman cut, knee deep, middle deep,  and he laid his snow-shoes on the snow and set the red lantern on them,  as he reconnoitred. Middle deep, neck deep, and he fell forward on his  face into the yielding mass. \"This will not do, I must not fall like  that often,\" said Silas to himself, as he gained his balance and threw  himself backward against the mass. Slowly he turned round, worked back  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#16)"],[1,"into operation. That, of course, ended our  bombardment of them. The rays were a perfect defense, disintegrating our  rockets as they were reached.    If they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and if they  had none within sufficient radius already in the air, all would be well.    I queried Garlin on this, but he assured me Yellow Intelligence reported  no indications of Han ships nearer than 800 miles. This would probably  give us a free hand for a while, since most of their instruments  recorded only imperfectly or not at all, through the death wall.    Requisitioning one of the viewplates of the headquarters ship, and the  services of an expert operator, I instructed him to focus on our lines  below. I wanted a close-up of the men in action.    He began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved rapidly  across the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he reached an  adjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor, apparently 100  feet wide, with the intervening branches and foliage of the trees  appearing like shadows that melted into reality a few feet above the  ground.    I watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed. His lips  pursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he adjusted the tall  tripod on which the long tube was balanced. Swiftly he twirled the knobs  controlling the aim and elevation of his piece. Then, lifting a belt of  ammunition from the big box, which itself looked heavy enough to break  down the spindly tripod, he inserted the end of it in the lock of his  tube and touched the proper combination of buttons.    Then he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering carefully  through the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I knew  that at intervals of something less than a second, it was discharging  small projectiles which, traveling under their own continuously reduced  power, were arching into the air, to fall precisely five miles ahead and  explode with the force of eight-inch shells, such as we used in the  First World War.    Another gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand and called  out something to him. Then, picking up his own tube and tripod, he  gauged the distance between the trees ahead of him, and the height of  their lowest branches, and bending forward a bit, flexed his muscles and  leaped lightly, some twenty-five feet. Another leap took him another  twenty feet or so, where he began to set up his piece.    I ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He got a  close focus on it, but this showed little except a continuous series of  blinding flashes, which, from the viewplate, lit up the entire interior  of the ship. An eight-hundred-foot focus proved better. I had thought  that some of our French and American artillery of the 20th Century had  achieved the ultimate in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never  seen anything to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions  as it moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass  (or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and the  splintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth of from ten  to twenty feet.    By now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines of  vibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction, inevitably  squeezing the panic-stricken Sinsings between them.    Even as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a futile effort  to get their three rep-ray machines into the air, abandoned their  efforts, and rushed forth into the milling mob.    I queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this attempt of  theirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt as to what was  going on, had continued to \"play safe,\" and broken off their power  broadcast, after ordering all their own ships east of the Alleghenies to  the ground, for fear these ships they had traded to the Sinsings might  be used against them.    Again I turned to my viewplate, which was still focussed on the central  section of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was entirely  that of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached them.    Some of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over the barrage  line, then gave it up. They realized that they had no target to shoot  at, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a few hundred feet or  several miles beyond it.    Their ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood around in  tense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around their ears,  nervously fingering the tuning controls at their belts. Unquestionably  they must have located some of our frequencies, and overheard many of  our reports and orders. But they were confused and disorganized. If they  had an Ultrophone Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an  organized way.    They were beginning to draw back now before our advancing fire. With  intermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our barrage again,  and the explosions of their rockets flashed at widely scattered points  beyond. A few took distance \"pot shots.\"    Oddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first casualties in  the battle. Some of these distance shots by chance registered hits,  while our men were under strict orders not to exceed their barrage  distances.    Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as though it were  being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while the explosions  of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.    The two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet apart when  the Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen. We noticed first  that they began to lighten themselves by throwing away extra equipment.  A few of them in their excitement threw away too much, and shot suddenly  into the air. Then a scattering few floated up gently, followed by  increasing numbers, while still others, preserving a weight balance,  jumped toward the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear  them. Some succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a  windstorm, to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the  barrage, their belts blown from their bodies.    However, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of them to  escape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the word to Bill  Hearn to have the alternate men in his line raise their barrages and  heard him bark out a mathematical formula to the Unit Bosses.    We backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air in  stagger formation until they reached a height of three miles. I don't  believe any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to freedom  succeeded.    But we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got away and  ultimately reached Nu-yok.    It was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the most  trouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw we would not  have enough to establish successive ground barrages and so ordered the  barrage back two miles, from which positions our \"curtains\" began to  close in again, this time, however, gauged to explode, not on contact,  but thirty feet in the air. This left little chance for the Sinsings to  leap either over or under it.    Gradually, the two barrages approached each other until they finally  met, and in the grey dawn the battle ended.    Our own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,  eighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of  the enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and  \"kite-tail\" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of  the enemy's ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.    Since nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,  been killed, we considered the raid a great success.    It had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all of us who  took part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our barrage tactics  definitely established a confidence in our ability to overcome the Hans.    As I pointed out to Wilma:    \"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American explosive  rocket is a far more efficient weapon than the disintegrator ray of the  Hans, once we can train all our gangs to use it systematically and in  co-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the hands of a single individual,  shooting at a mark in direct line of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior  in destructive power to the dis ray, except as its range may be a little  greater. The trouble is that to date it has been used only as we used  our rifles and shot guns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its  use as artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or  climb into the air, are tremendous.    \"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The rocket gun  does not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a straight line. The  rocket may be made to travel in an arc, over intervening obstacles, to  an unseen target.    \"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a perfect  shield against the dis ray in inertron.\"    \"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that are ahead  of us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses against our new  tactics. And they are sure to mass against us not only the full force of  their power in America, but the united forces of the World Empire. They  are a cowardly race in one sense, but clever as the very Devils in Hell,  and inheritors of a calm, ruthless, vicious persistency.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" I prophesied, \"the Finger of Doom points squarely at  them today, and unless you and I are killed in the struggle, we shall  live to see America blast the Yellow Blight from the face of the Earth.\"      THE END.
