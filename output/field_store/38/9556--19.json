One of their nation whom God       has plucked as a brand from the burning, attempted to explain the       Christian religion to them. They listened and bowed assent, saying       \"ha, ha.\" Oh, Lord, if Thou wilt qualify me and send me to dispense       to them the Bread of Life, I will throw myself upon Thy mercy, and       submit to Thy will.         _August 20th._--Amongst all the authors with whom I am acquainted,       who treat on Church Government, the Rev. Dr. Campbell is the most       clear and satisfactory. With a great deal of talent, penetration,       and research, he exhibits the Church in all her various forms, till       her power made empires tremble, and her riches bid defiance to       poverty. His excellent lectures have enlarged my mind on the       subject of ecclesiastical polity, and rendered my feelings more       liberal. I am convinced that form of government is best which most       secures order and union in society.         _August 20th--Sabbath._--To-day closes my ministerial labours at       York, where I have been stationed for two years.

Draper on \"_The Clergy Reserve Question;  as a Matter of History, a Question of Law, and a Subject of  Legislation_.\" Toronto, 1839, pp. 11, 12.          CHAPTER IV.    1826-1827.    Missionary to the River Credit Indians.      At the Conference of 1826, I was appointed Missionary to the Indians at  the Credit, but was required to continue the second year as preacher,  two Sundays out of four, in the Town of York, of which my elder brother,  William, was superintendent, including in his charge several other  townships. He was aided by a colleague, who preached in the country, but  not in the town.    The Chippewa tribe of Indians had a tract of land on the Credit River,  on which the Government proposed to build a village of some twenty or  thirty cottages, with the intention of building a church for them and  inducing them to join the Church of England, upon the pretext that the  Methodist preachers were Yankees. As my Father had been a British  officer, and fought seven years during the American Rebellion for the  unity of the Empire, was the first High Sheriff in the London District  (having been appointed in 1808); and had, with his sons, fought in  defence of the country in the war of the United States with Great  Britain, in 1812-1815, and my father's elder brother having been the  organizer of the Militia and Courts of the London District, the name  Ryerson became a sort of synonym for loyalist throughout the official  circles of the province; and my appointment, therefore, as the first  stationed Missionary among the Indians, and from thence to other tribes,  was a veritable and standing proof that the imputation of disloyalty  against the Methodist Missionaries was groundless.    When I commenced my labours among these poor Credit Indians (about two  hundred in number) they had not entered into the cottages which the  Government had built for them on the high ground, but still lived in  their bark-covered wigwams on the flats beside the bank of the River  Credit. One of them, made larger than the others, was used for a place  of worship. In one of these bark-covered and brush-enclosed wigwams, I  ate and slept for some weeks; my bed consisting of a plank, a mat, and  a blanket, and a blanket also for my covering; yet I was never more  comfortable and happy:--God, the Lord, was the strength of my heart,  and--         \"Jesus, all the day long, was my joy and my song.\"    [Illustration: Indian Village at the River Credit in 1827--Winter.]    Maintaining my dignity as a minister, I showed the Indians that I could  work and live as they worked and lived.    Having learned that it was intended by the advisers of the  Lieutenant-Governor, on the completion of the cottages, to erect an  Episcopal Church of England for the absorption of the Indian converts  from the Methodists into that Church, I resolved to be before them, and  called the Indians together on the Monday morning after the first  Sunday's worship with them, and using the head of a barrel for a desk,  commenced a subscription among them to build a house for the double  purpose of the worship of God and the teaching of their children. Never  did the Israelites, when assembled and called upon by King David, (as  recorded in the 29th chapter of the first book of Chronicles) to  subscribe for the erection of the Temple, respond with more cordiality  and liberality, in proportion to their means, than did these converted  children of the forest come forward and present their humble offerings  for the erection of a house in which to worship God, and teach their  children. The squaws came forward to subscribe from shillings to  dollars, the proceeds of what they might earn and sell in baskets, mats,  moccasins, &c., and the men subscribed with corresponding heartiness and  liberality of the salmon that they should catch--which were then  abundant in the river, and which, I think, sold for about twelve and a  half cents each.    On the same day, a plan of the house was prepared, and I engaged on my  own individual responsibility, a carpenter-mason, by the name of  Priestman (who had been employed by the Government to build the Indian  cottages), to build and finish the house for the double purpose of  worship and school, and then mounted my horse and visited my old friends  in York, on Yonge Street, Hamilton, and Niagara Circuits, and begged  money to pay for all, and at the end of six weeks the house was built  and paid for, while our \"swell\" friends of the Government and of the  Church of England were consulting and talking about the matter. It was  thus that the Church-standing of these Indian converts was maintained,  and they were enabled to walk in the Lord Jesus as they had found Him.    My labours this season were very varied and severe. I had to travel to  York (eighteen miles) on horseback, often through very bad roads, and  preach two Sundays out of four (my second year in town). After having  collected the means necessary to build the house of worship and  school-house, I showed the Indians how to enclose and make gates for  their gardens, having some knowledge and skill in mechanics.[8]    Between daylight and sunrise, I called out four of the Indians in  succession, and showed them how, and worked with them, to clear and  fence in, and plow and plant their first wheat and corn fields. In the  afternoon, I called out the school-boys to go with me, and cut and pile,  and burn the underbrush in and around the village. The little fellows  worked with great glee, as long as I worked with them, but soon began to  play when I left them.    In addition to my other work, I had to maintain a heavy controversy  with several clergymen of the Church of England on Apostolic Ordination  and Succession, and the equal civil rights and privileges of different  religious denominations.[9]    A few months after my appointment to the Credit Indian Mission, the  Government made the annual distribution of presents to the Georgian Bay  and Lake Simcoe Indians--all of whom were assembled at the Holland  Landing, on the banks of the Holland River, at the southwest extremity  of Lake Simcoe. They consisted chiefly of the Snake tribe, the  Yellowhead tribe (Yellowhead was the head Chief), and the John Aissance  tribe. Peter Jones and I, with John Sunday, had visited this tribe at  Newmarket, the year before, and preached to them and held meetings with  them, when they embraced the Christian religion, and remained true and  faithful. Peter Jones and myself attended the great annual meeting of  the Indians, and opened the Gospel Mission among them. In my first  address, which was interpreted by Peter Jones, I explained to the  assembled Indians the cause of their poverty, misery, and wretchedness,  as resulting from their having offended the Great Being who created  them, but who still loved them so much as to send His Son to save them,  and to give them new hearts, that they might forsake their bad ways, be  sober and industrious; not quarrel, but love one another, &c. I  contrasted the superiority of the religion we brought to them over that  of those who used images. This gave great offence to the French Roman  Catholic Indian traders, who said they would kill me, and beat Peter  Jones. On hearing this, Col. Givens, the Chief Indian Superintendent,  called them together and told them that the Missionary Ryerson's father  was a good man for the King, and had fought for him in two wars--in the  last of which his sons had fought with him--and that if they hurt one of  these sons, they would offend their great father the King; that Peter  Jones' father had surveyed Government lands on which many of the Indians  lived. This representative of the Government, a man of noble feelings  and generous impulses, threw over us the shield of Royal protection.    After the issuing of the goods to the Indians, Peter Jones remained with  the Huron and Georgian Bay Indians, and preached to them with great  power; while I went on board a schooner, with the Yellowhead Indians,  for the Narrows, on the northern shore of Lake Simcoe, near Orillia,  where the Indians owned Yellowhead (now Chief) Island, and which I  examined with a view of selecting a place for worship, and for  establishing a school. A Mission-school was established on this island.  It was afterwards removed by Rev. S. (now Dr.) Rose and others to the  mainland at Orillia, and was faithfully taught by the late William Law  (1827"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#16)"],[1," he had never seen.  Nevertheless, he had often heard the Frau making a noise therein, and  he would have willingly risked his life to know what was there  concealed. Reflecting upon his travelling-money, it occurred to him  that there his mistress might conceal her treasures. But the door was  always tightly closed, and therefore he could not get at them.    One morning, after the Frau Ahavzi had gone out, one of the little  dogs who was treated by her in a very stepmother-like manner, but  whose favor he had in a great degree gained by various acts of  kindness, pulled him by his wide pantaloons, and acted as if he wanted  Muck to follow him. Muck, who always gladly played with him, did so,  and perceived that the dog was leading him to the sleeping apartment  of his mistress; he stopped before a door, which the little fellow had  never before observed, and which was now wide open. The dog entered,  and Muck, following, was overjoyed at finding himself in the very  chamber, which had so long been the object of his curiosity. He looked  all around for money, but could find none: old garments only, and  strangely-fashioned vases were scattered around. One of the latter, in  particular, attracted his attention; it was of crystal, and fine  figures were cut thereon. He lifted it up and turned it on all sides;  but, oh horror! he had not observed that it had a lid, which was but  insecurely fastened on: it fell to the floor, and broke into a  thousand pieces.    For a long time stood Little Muck motionless through terror; now was  his fate decided, now must he fly, or be killed by the old woman. His  departure was immediately resolved on; he only looked around, to see  if he could not use some of the goods of the Frau Ahavzi upon his  journey. Thereupon, a formidable pair of huge slippers met his eye;  they were not, it is true, beautiful, but his own could hold out no  longer; moreover their size was an inducement, for when he had these  upon his feet, people would see, he hoped, that he had cast off the  shoes of childhood. He quickly took off his own slippers, and put on  the others. A walking-stick, also, with a fine lion's head cut upon  the handle, seemed to be standing too idly in the corner; so he seized  it, and hurried from the apartment. He hastened to his own room, put  on his cloak, arranged his paternal turban, placed the dagger in his  girdle, and ran as fast as his feet would carry him, out of the house,  and out of the city. Fear of his old mistress drove him farther and  still farther, until, from fatigue, he could scarcely run any more. He  had never gone so quickly in his life; nay, it appeared to him as if  he could not cease running, for an invisible power seemed propelling  him on. At last he observed that this must be connected with the  slippers, for they would continually shoot forward and bear him along  with them. He endeavored in various ways, to stand still, but could  not succeed; at last, in the greatest distress, he cried out to  himself, as a man calls to his horse, \"Wo--wo!\" Then the slippers  stopped, and Muck fell exhausted upon the earth.    The slippers were a source of great joy to him. Thus had he, by his  services, gained something that would help him on his way through the  world to seek his fortune. In spite of his joy, he fell asleep through  fatigue; for the body of Little Muck, which had to carry so heavy a  head, could not hold out long. In his dream the little dog appeared to  him, which had assisted him to the slippers in the house of the Frau  Ahavzi, and thus spoke:--    \"Dear Muck, thou dost not still rightly understand the use of the  slippers: know that if, in them, thou turnest thyself three times  around upon the heel, thou canst fly wherever thou wilt; and with the  staff thou canst find treasures, for, wherever gold is buried, it will  beat three times upon the earth; where silver, twice.\"    Thus dreamed Little Muck. When he awoke, he reflected on the singular  vision, and resolved to make the experiment immediately. He put on the  slippers, lifted one foot, and began to turn around upon his heel. But  whoever has attempted to perform this manoeuvre in an enormously wide  slipper, will not wonder that the Little Muck could not succeed,  particularly when he remembers that his heavy head kept falling on  this side and on that.    The poor little fellow fell several times violently upon his nose;  nevertheless, that did not deter him from making the trial again, and  at last he succeeded. Like a wheel he went around upon his heel,  wishing himself in the nearest large city, and--the slippers mounted  into the air, ran with the speed of the wind through the clouds, and  before Little Muck knew what to make of it, he found himself in a  large market-place, where many stalls were erected, and innumerable  men were busily running to and fro. He moved among the people, but  considered it more prudent to retire into a less frequented street,  for near the market one of the slippers bore him along so rapidly,  that he almost fell down, or else ran against one and another with  his projecting dagger, so that it was with difficulty he avoided their  blows.    Little Muck now seriously reflected what he should set about, in order  to earn a piece of money. He had, it is true, a staff which would show  him concealed treasures, but how could he find a place where gold or  silver was buried. He could, indeed, in this emergency, have exhibited  himself for money, but for this he was too proud. At last the  quickness of his gait occurred to him. Perhaps, thought he, my  slippers can procure me support, and he determined to hire himself out  as a courier. He ventured to hope that the king of the city rewarded  such service well, so he inquired for the palace. Before the door of  the palace stood a guard, who asked him what he sought there. On  answering that he was in search of service, they led him to the  overseer of the slaves. Before this one he laid his request, and  entreated that he might be admitted among the royal couriers. The  overseer measured him with his eyes from head to foot, and said: \"How!  with thy little feet, which are scarcely a span long, wishest thou to  become a royal messenger? Away with thee! I cannot play with every  fool.\"    Little Muck assured him, however, that his proposal was made in  perfect seriousness, and that he would let it come to a trial with the  swiftest, upon a wager. The matter seemed very ludicrous to the  overseer. He commanded him to hold himself in readiness for a race in  the afternoon, and leading him into the kitchen, saw that he was  furnished with proper meat and drink. He himself, however, repaired  unto the king, and told him of the little man and his proposal. The  king was a merry lord, and therefore it pleased him well that the  overseer had kept the little man for their amusement. He directed him  to make preparations in a large meadow behind the castle, that the  race might be conveniently beheld by his whole court, and once more  commanded him to take great care of the dwarf. The king told his  princes, and princesses, what a pastime they were to enjoy that  afternoon; these told it again to their attendants, and when the time  arrived all were in great expectation; and as many as had feet poured  into the meadow, where a scaffolding had been erected, in order to  see the boastful dwarf run.    As soon as the king and his sons and daughters had taken their places  upon the platform, the Little Muck walked forth upon the meadow, and  made before the noble sovereign a very elegant bow. A universal cry of  joy arose, the moment they beheld the little fellow; such a figure had  they never seen. The small body with the mighty head, the little  cloak, and the wide pantaloons, the long dagger in the broad girdle,  the tiny feet in the immense slippers--no! it was so droll a sight  they could not keep from laughing aloud. Little Muck, however, was not  disconcerted by their laughter. He proudly walked forward, supported  by his cane, and awaited his opponent. At Muck's own desire, the  overseer of the slaves had selected the best runner. Walking in, he  placed himself near the dwarf, and both looked for the signal.  Thereupon the Princess Amarza made a sign with her veil as had been  preconcerted, and, like two arrows shot from the same bow, the racers  flew over the meadow.    At first the courier took a tremendous bound, but Muck pursued him in  his slipper carriage, overtook him, passed him, and had been standing  for some time at the goal, when his opponent, gasping for breath, ran  up. Amazement for a few moments enchained the spectators: the king was  the first to clap his hands; then shouted the crowd for joy, all  exclaiming, \"Long live the Little Muck, the victor in the race!\"    Meanwhile they had brought up the little man; he prostrated himself  before the king, saying, \"Most mighty King, I have here given thee but  a small proof of my powers; allow them, I pray thee, to give me a  place among thy couriers.\" The king answered:--    \"Nay, dear Muck, thou shalt be my favorite messenger, and shalt remain  about my person; every year shalt thou have a hundred gold pieces as  thy wages, and thou shalt sup at the table of my first attendant.\"    Then Muck thought he had at last found the fortune, of which he had so  long been in search, and was merry and light-hearted. Moreover, he  rejoiced in the peculiar favor of the king, for the latter employed  him on his quickest and most secret errands, which he performed with  the greatest care, and with inconceivable rapidity.    But the other attendants of the king were not well affected towards  him, because they reluctantly saw themselves displaced from their  lord's favor by a dwarf, who knew how to do nothing, but to run fast.  They set on foot many a conspiracy against him in order to work his  destruction, but all failed, through the confidence which the king"]]]
