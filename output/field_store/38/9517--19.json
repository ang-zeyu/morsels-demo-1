It is cheap, durable, is not in any way affected by sweat, and  does not chafe or heat the horse's spine like the woolen blanket. Its  open texture allows a rapid evaporation, which tends to keep the back  cool, and obviates the danger of stripping and sudden exposure of the  heated parts to the sun and air.    The experience of some of our officers who have used this mat for years  in Mexico and Texas corroborates all I have said in its favor; and they  are unanimous in the opinion that a horse will never get a sore back  when it is placed under a good saddle.    A saddle made by the Mexicans in California is called the _California  saddle_. This is extensively used upon the Pacific slope of the  mountains, and is believed to possess, at least, as many advantages for  rough frontier service as any other pattern that has been invented.  Those hardy and experienced veterans, the mountaineers, could not be  persuaded to ride any other saddle, and their ripened knowledge of such  matters certainly gives weight to their conclusions.    [Illustration: CALIFORNIA SADDLE.]    The merits of the California saddle consist in its being light, strong,  and compact, and conforming well to the shape of the horse. When  strapped on, it rests so firmly in position that the strongest pull of  a horse upon a lariat attached to the pommel can not displace it. Its  shape is such that the rider is compelled to sit nearly erect, with his  legs on the continuation of the line of the body, which makes his seat  more secure, and, at the same time, gives him a better control over his  arms and horse. This position is attained by setting the stirrup-leathers  farther back than on the old-fashioned saddle. The pommel is high, like  the Mexican saddle, and prevents the rider from being thrown forward.  The tree is covered with raw hide, put on green, and sewed; when this  dries and contracts it gives it great strength. It has no iron in its  composition, but is kept together by buckskin strings, and can easily  be taken to pieces for mending or cleaning. It has a hair girth about  five inches wide.    The whole saddle is covered with a large and thick sheet of  sole-leather, having a hole to lay over the pommel; it extends back  over the horse's hips, and protects them from rain, and when taken off  in camp it furnishes a good security against dampness when placed under  the traveler's bed.    The California saddle-tree is regarded by many as the best of all  others for the horse's back, and as having an easier seat than the  Mexican.    General Comte de la Roche-Aymon, in his treatise upon \"Light Troops,\"  published in Paris in 1856, says:    \"In nearly all the European armies the equipment of the horse is not in  harmony with the new tactics--with those tactics in which, during  nearly all of a campaign, the cavalry remains in bivouac. Have we  reflected upon the kind of saddle which, under these circumstances,  would cover the horse best without incommoding him during the short  periods that he is permitted to repose? Have we reflected upon the kind  of saddle which, offering the least fragility, exposes the horse to the  least danger of sore back? All the cuirassiers and the dragoons of  Europe have saddles which they call _French saddle_, the weight of  which is a load for the horse. The interior mechanism of these saddles  is complicated and filled with weak bands of iron, which become  deranged, bend, and sometimes break; the rider does not perceive these  accidents, or he does not wish to perceive them, for fear of being left  behind or of having to go on foot; he continues on, and at the end of a  day's march his horse has a sore back, and in a few days is absolutely  unserviceable. We may satisfy ourselves of the truth of these  observations by comparing the lists of horses sent to the rear during  the course of a campaign by the cuirassiers and dragoons who use the  French saddle, and by the hussars with the Hungarian saddle. The number  sent to the rear by the latter is infinitely less, although employed in  a service much more active and severe; and it might be still less by  making some slight improvements in the manner of fixing their saddle  upon the horse.    \"It is a long time since Marshal Saxe said there was but one kind of  saddle fit for cavalry, which was the hussar saddle: this combined all  advantages, lightness, solidity, and economy. It is astonishing that  the system of actual war had not led to the employment of the kind of  saddle in use among the Tartars, the Cossacks, the Hungarians, and,  indeed, among all horsemen and nomads. This saddle has the  incontestable advantage of permitting the horse to lie down and rest  himself without inconvenience. If, notwithstanding the folded blanket  which they place under the Hungarian saddle, this saddle will still  wound the animal's back sometimes, this only proceeds from the friction  occasioned by the motion of the horse and the movement of the rider  upon the saddle; a friction which it will be nearly impossible to  avoid, inasmuch as the saddle-bow is held in its place only by a  surcingle, the ends of which are united by a leathern band: these bands  always relax more or less, and the saddle becomes loose. To remedy  this, I propose to attach to the saddle-bow itself a double girth, one  end of which shall be made fast to the arch in front, and the other end  to the rear of the arch upon the right side, to unite in a single  girth, which would buckle to a strap attached upon the left side in the  usual manner. This buckle will hold the saddle firmly in its place.    \"Notwithstanding all these precautions, however, there were still some  inconveniences resulting from the nature of the blanket placed under  the saddle, which I sought to remedy, and I easily accomplished it. The  woolen nap of the cavalry saddle-blankets, not being carefully attended  to, soon wears off, and leaves only the rough, coarse threads of the  fabric; this absorbs the sweat from the horse, and, after it has dried  and become hard, it acts like a rasp upon the withers, first taking off  the hair, next the skin, and then the flesh, and, finally, the beast is  rendered unserviceable.    \"I sought, during the campaign of 1807, a means to remedy this evil,  and I soon succeeded by a process as simple as it was cheap. I  distributed among a great number of cavalry soldiers pieces of linen  cloth folded double, two feet square, and previously dipped in melted  tallow. This cloth was laid next to the horse's back, under the  saddle-blanket, and it prevented all the bad effects of the woolen  blanket. No horses, after this appliance, were afflicted with sore  backs. Such are the slight changes which I believe should be made in  the use of the Hungarian saddle. The remainder of the equipment should  remain (as it always has been) composed of a breast-strap, crupper, and  martingale, etc.\"    The improvements of the present age do not appear to have developed any  thing advantageous to the saddle; on the contrary, after experimenting  upon numerous modifications and inventions, public sentiment has at  length given the preference to the saddle-tree of the natives in Asia  and America, which is very similar to that of the Hungarians.      SORES AND DISEASES.    If a horse be sweating at the time he is unsaddled, it is well to strap  the folded saddle-blanket upon his back with the surcingle, where it is  allowed to remain until he is perfectly dry. This causes the back to  cool gradually, and prevents scalding or swelling. Some persons are in  the habit of washing their horses' backs while heated and sweating with  cold water, but this is pernicious, and often produces sores. It is  well enough to wash the back after it cools, but not before. After  horses' backs or shoulders once become chafed and sore, it is very  difficult to heal them, particularly when they are continued at work.  It is better, if practicable, to stop using them for a while, and wash  the bruised parts often with castile soap and water. Should it be  necessary, however, to continue the animal in use, I have known very  severe sores entirely healed by the free application of grease to the  parts immediately after halting, and while the animal is warm and  sweating. This seems to harden the skin and heal the wound even when  working with the collar in contact with it. A piece of bacon rind tied  upon the collar over the wound is also an excellent remedy.    In Texas, when the horse-flies are numerous, they attack animals  without mercy, and where a contusion is found in the skin they deposit  eggs, which speedily produce worms in great numbers. I have tried the  effect of spirits of turpentine and several other remedies, but nothing  seemed to have the desired effect but calomel blown into the wound,  which destroyed the worms and soon effected a cure.    In the vicinity of the South Pass, upon the Humboldt River, and in some  sections upon other routes to California, alkaline water is found,  which is very poisonous to animals that drink it, and generates a  disease known in California as \"_alkali_.\" This disease first makes its  appearance by swellings upon the abdomen and between the fore legs, and  is attended with a cough, which ultimately destroys the lungs and kills  the animal. If taken at an early stage, this disease is curable, and  the following treatment is generally considered as the most  efficacious. The animal is first raked, after which a large dose of  grease is poured down its throat; acids are said to have the same  effect, and give immediate relief. When neither of these remedies can  be procured, many of the emigrants have been in the habit of mixing  starch or flour in a bucket of water, and allowing the animal to drink  it. It is supposed that this forms a coating over the mucous membrane,  and thus defeats the action of the poison.

[Illustration: No. 134.--De Balliol.]      [Illustration: No. 135.--Single Tressure Flory.]      [Illustration: No. 137.--Double Tressure flory counterflory.]      [Illustration: No. 136.--Single Tressure flory counterflory.]      [Illustration: No. 138.--Scotland.]    The TRESSURE (H. 3) may be regarded as a variety of the Orle; indeed, in  its simplest form it is a very narrow Orle, which is generally set round  with fleurs de lys. A Tressure thus enriched is represented in No. 135:  in this example all the heads of the fleurs de lys point externally, and  all their stalks internally, and this accordingly is blazoned as a  \"_Tressure flory_.\" In No. 136, which, like No. 135, is a single  Tressure, the fleurs de lys are so disposed that the heads and stalks of  the flowers point alternately in contrary directions: this is blazoned  as a \"_Tressure flory counterflory_.\" From this last example the  Tressure that is so well known in the blazonry of the Royal Shield of  SCOTLAND differs, in being \"_double_.\" This, the double Tressure of  Scotland, is a combination of two such single Tressures as No. 136, and  it is produced from them in the manner following:--From one such single  Tressure, as No. 136, all the alternate heads and stalks of the fleurs  de lys that point internally are cut away and removed; then a second  similar Tressure, of rather smaller size, is denuded of all its external  adornment, and in that condition it is placed within the former  Tressure, leaving a narrow interval between the two. Each component half  of this \"double Tressure flory counterflory,\" accordingly, has its own  independent series of demi-fleurs de lys, the stalks and heads of the  flowers alternating, and the one alternate series pointing externally,  while the other points internally. When in combination, these two series  of demi-fleurs de lys must be so arranged that the heads of the flowers  in one series correspond with their stalks in the other, as in No. 137.  I am thus particular in describing the process of producing the Royal  Tressure, because it is frequently to be seen incorrectly drawn. No.  138, the Royal Shield of SCOTLAND, now displayed in the second quarter  of the Royal Arms of the UNITED KINGDOM, is thus blazoned--_Or, a lion  rampt. within a double Tressure flory counterflory, gu._ It will be  observed that a narrow strip of the golden field of this Shield  intervenes between the two Tressures. There are many fine examples of  this Shield in Scottish Seals; in the Garter-plate, also, of JAMES V. of  Scotland, K.G., at Windsor; and on the Monuments in Westminster Abbey to  MARY Queen of SCOTS (A.D. 1604), and to the Countess of LENNOX, the  mother of Lord DARNLEY (A.D. 1577). Mr. Seton (\"Scottish Heraldry,\" p.  447) states that the Tressure may be borne \"triple\"; and, after  specifying the Scottish families upon whose Shields the same honourable  bearing is blazoned, he adds:--\"In the coat of the Marquess of HUNTLY,  the Tressure is flowered with fleurs de lys within, and adorned with  _crescents_ without; while in that of the Earl of ABERDEEN it is  flowered and counter-flowered with _thistles_, _roses_, and fleurs de  lys alternately.\"      [Illustration: No. 139.--De Waltone.]      [Illustration: No. 140.--Richard, Earl of Cornwall.]    The BORDURE (H. 3), as its name implies, forms a border to a Shield: it  is borne both plain and charged. Thus, for DE WALTONE (E. 2)--_Arg.,  a cross patée sa., within a Bordure indented gu._, No. 139: for RICHARD,  Earl of CORNWALL, second son of King JOHN (H. 3),--_Arg., a lion rampt.  gu., crowned or, within a Bordure sa. bezantée_, No. 140. The Bordure,  and its important services in Heraldry, will be more fully considered  hereafter. (See Chapters XII. and XIII.)    FLANCHES are always borne in pairs; but they are not of very early date,  nor do they often appear in blazon. _Flanches_ are formed by two curved  lines issuing from the chief, one on each side of the Shield: they are  shown, shaded for azure, in No. 141; and in No. 142 are their  Diminutives, _Flasques_ or _Voiders_, shaded for gules. But these  diminutives are hardly ever met with. There is a close resemblance  between these charges and a peculiar dress worn by Ladies of rank in the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but it is not easy to determine  whether the dress suggested the Flanches on the Shield, or was derived  from them. One thing, however, is certain--the dress must have possessed  very decided good qualities, since it continued in favour for more than  two centuries. It is remarkable that many of the ancient Greek Shields  have pierced Flanches.      [Illustration: No. 141.--Flanches.]      [Illustration: No. 142.--Flasques.]      [Illustration: No. 143.--Mascle.]      [Illustration: No. 144.--Rustre.]      [Illustration: No. 145.--De Burgh, Earl of Kent.]    The LOZENGE (E. 2), MASCLE (H. 3), and RUSTRE. The _Lozenge_ is a  diamond-shaped figure, or a parallelogram set diagonally. The _Mascle_  is a _Lozenge voided of the field_, No. 143; and the _Rustre_, No. 144,  is a _Lozenge pierced with a circular opening_. In the early days of  Heraldry the Lozenge and the Mascle were evidently held to be identical.  The Shield of the famous HUBERT DE BURGH, Earl of KENT, in the early  Rolls is blazoned as \"_masculée_\": but his Seal proves it to have been,  as in No. 145, _lozengy vair and gu._ The Lozenge, it will be  remembered, is always set erect upon the field of a Shield.    The FUSIL is an _elongated Lozenge_. The Arms of MONTACUTE or MONTAGU  (see No. 20) are--_Arg., three Fusils conjoined in fesse gu._, No. 20:  the Arms of PERCY are--_Az., five fusils conjoined in fesse or._      [Illustration: No. 20.--Montacute.]      [Illustration: No. 146.--Deincourt.]    The BILLET (H. 3) is a small elongated rectangular figure. Thus, for  DEINCOURT, No. 146--_Az., billettée, a fesse dancette or._ The early  Heralds blazoned a \"Fesse Dancette\" as simply a \"_Dancette_\" or  \"_Danse_.\" See also No. 130.      [Illustration: No. 147.--Campbell.]    The GYRON, a triangular figure, not known in English blazon as a  separate charge (except perhaps in the one case of the arms of  Mortimer), gives its title to the _gyronny field_, which is more  commonly found in the Heraldry of the North than of the South. The field  gyronny generally, and more particularly in Scotland, is divided into  _eight pieces_: but the divisions are sometimes six, ten, twelve, or  even sixteen in number. A Roll of the time of HENRY III. has, for WARIN  DE BASINGBORNE--\"_Gerony d'or et d'azur_.\" The Arms of CAMPBELL  are--_Gyronny or and sa._, No. 147.[3] Here, where there are eight  pieces of divisions, it is not necessary to specify the number; but if  they were either more or less than eight the blazon would be--_gyronny  of six, of ten, &c._        [Footnote 3: In the illustration the colours are unfortunately      reversed.]    The FRETTE, in more recent Heraldry, has generally superseded the  original _field fretty_. This interlaced design, whether borne as a  distinct figure, as No. 148, or repeated over the field of a Shield, as  in No. 149, differs from a field lozengy or gyronny, in being a bearing  charged _upon_ the field of a Shield, and not a form of varied surface:  No. 149, for DE ETCHINGHAM (E. 2), is--_Az., fretty arg._ An early  variety or modification of Frette is the _Trellis_ or _Treille_, in  which the pieces do not interlace, but all those in bend lie over all  those in bend sinister, and they are fastened at the crossings with  nails--\"_clouée_,\" as in No. 150. RICHARD DE TRUSSELL or TRESSELL (H. 3)  bears--_Arg., a trellis gu., clouée or_.      [Illustration: No. 148.--A Frette.]      [Illustration: No. 149.--De Etchingham.]      [Illustration: No. 150.--Trellis Clouée.]    The ROUNDLES, or ROUNDLETS. These simple figures, in constant use in  every age of Heraldry, are divided into two groups, which correspond  with the division of the Tinctures into \"Metals\" and \"Colours.\"    The first group contains the two Roundles of the _Metals_, which are  _flat discs_: 1, The _Bezant_, or golden Roundle, No. 151, which has  apparently derived its name from the Byzantine coins with which the  Crusaders, when in the East, would have been familiar. 2, The Silver  Roundle, or _Plate_, is from the Spanish \"Plata\"--_silver_. When Bezants  or Plates appear in considerable numbers, the field on which they are  charged is said to be \"_bezantée_\" or \"_platée_.\" See No. 140.    The second group contains the five Roundles of the _Colours_, which are  _globular_, and are usually shaded accordingly. The _Torteau_, No. 152,  in the plural _Torteaux_, is gules: the _Hurt_ is azure: the _Pellet_ or  _Ogress_ is sable: the _Pomme_ is vert: and the _Golpe_ is purpure.  These distinctive titles, which are more calculated to perplex the  student than to simplify his study, are of comparatively recent origin,  the early Heralds having used the terms \"_Bezant_,\" \"_Plate_,\" and  \"_Torteau_,\" with the general designations \"_Roundle_\" and \"_Pellet_,\"  adding the tinctures for the others. Examples:--_Az., bezantée_, for WM.  DE LA ZOUCHE: _Or, on a fesse gu. three plates_, for ROGER DE  HUNTINGFIELD: _Arg., ten torteaux, four, three, two, one_, for ALEX.  GIFFARD (all H. 3).

Examples:--_Arg., three fountains_,  for WELLES: _Arg., a Chevron sable between three fountains_, borne by a  family named _Sykes_, their name being an ancient term signifying a well  or fountain. An _Annulet_, or a plain ring, No. 154, was sometimes  blazoned as a \"_false Roundle_\"--a Roundle, that is, pierced, and having  its central area"]]]
