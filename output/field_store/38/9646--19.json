But the reader should procure the Catalogue       of Mr. Paris's Books, sold in the year 1790, which, for the       number of articles, is unrivalled. The eye is struck, in       every page, with the most sumptuous copies on VELLUM, AND       LARGE PAPER.]         [Footnote 61: See page 5, ante, for some account of this       curious work.]    VI. _First Editions._ From the time of Ancillon[62] to Askew, there  has been a very strong desire expressed for the possession of original  or first published editions of works, as they are in general  superintended and corrected by the author himself; and, like the first  impressions of prints, are considered more valuable. Whoever is  possessed with a passion for collecting books of this kind may  unquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of the Bibliomania;  but such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it deserving of severe  treatment or censure. All bibliographers have dwelt on the importance  of these editions, for the sake of collation with subsequent ones, and  detecting, as is frequently the case, the carelessness displayed by  future[63] editors. Of such importance is the _first edition of  Shakspeare_[64] considered, that a fac-simile reprint of it has been  published with success. In regard to the Greek and Latin Classics, the  possession of these original editions is of the first consequence to  editors who are anxious to republish the legitimate text of an author.  Wakefield, I believe always regretted that the first edition of  Lucretius had not been earlier inspected by him. When he began _his_  edition, the Editio Princeps was not (as I have understood) in the  library of Earl Spencer--the storehouse of almost every thing that is  exquisite and rare in ancient classical literature!         [Footnote 62: There is a curious and amusing article in       Bayle [English edition, vol. i., 672, &c.] about the elder       ANCILLON, who frankly confessed that he \"was troubled with       the BIBLIOMANIA, or disease of buying books.\" Mr. D'Israeli       says \"that he always purchased _first editions_, and never       waited for second ones,\"--but I find it, in the English       Bayle, note D, \"he chose _the best_ editions.\" The manner in       which Ancillon's library was pillaged by the Ecclesiastics       of Metz (where it was considered as the most valuable       curiosity in the town) is thus told by Bayle; \"Ancillon was       obliged to leave Metz: a company of Ecclesiastics, of all       orders, came from every part, to lay hands on this fine and       copious library, which had been collected with the utmost       care during forty years. They took away a great number of       the books together, and gave a little money, as they went       out, to a young girl, of twelve or thirteen years of age,       who looked after them, that they might have it to say they       had _paid for them_. Thus Ancillon saw that valuable       collection dispersed, in which, as he was wont to say, his       chief pleasure and even his heart was placed!\"--Edit. 1734.]         [Footnote 63: An instance of this kind may be adduced from       the _first edition_ of Fabian, printed in 1516; of which       Messrs. Longman, and Co., have now engaged a very able       editor to collate the text with that of the subsequent       editions. \"The antiquary,\" says the late Mr. BRAND, \"is       desired to consult the edition of Fabian, printed by Pynson,       in 1516, because there are others, and I remember to have       seen one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a       continuation to the end of Queen Mary, 1559, in which the       _language is much modernised_.\" Shakespeare, edit. 1803,       vol. xviii. p. 85-6.]         [Footnote 64: A singular story is \"extant\" about the       purchase of the late Duke of Roxburgh's fine copy of the       first edition of Shakespeare. A friend was bidding for him       in the sale-room: his Grace had retired to a distance, to       view the issue of the contest. Twenty guineas and more were       offered, from various quarters, for the book: a slip of       paper was handed to the Duke, in which he was requested to       inform his friend whether he was \"to go on bidding\"--His       Grace took his pencil, and wrote underneath, by way of reply--              ----lay on Macduff!            And d----d be he who first cries, 'Hold, enough!'         Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all       opposition. His Grace retired triumphant, with the book       under his arm.]    It must not, however, be forgotten that if first editions are, in some  instances, of great importance, they are in many respects superfluous,  and an incumbrance to the shelves of a collector; inasmuch as the  labours of subsequent editors have corrected their errors, and  superseded, by a great fund of additional matter, the necessity of  consulting them. Thus, not to mention other instances (which present  themselves while noticing the present one), all the fine things which  Colomies and Remannus have said about the rarity of La Croix du  Maine's Bibliotheque, published in 1584, are now unnecessary to be  attended to, since the ample and excellent edition of this work by De  La Monnoye and Juvigny, in six quarto volumes, 1772, has appeared. Nor  will any one be tempted to hunt for Gesner's Bibliotheca of 1545-8,  whatever may be its rarity, who has attended to Morhof's and Vogt's  recommendation of the last and best edition of 1583.    VII. _True Editions._ Some copies of a work are struck off with  deviations from the usually received ones, and, though these  deviations have neither sense nor beauty to recommend them, [and  indeed are principally _defects_] yet copies of this description are  eagerly sought after by collectors of a certain class! This particular  pursuit may therefore be called another, or the seventh, symptom of  the Bibliomania. The note below [65] will furnish the reader with a  few anecdotes relating to it.         [Footnote 65: _Caesar. Lug. Bat._ 1635, 12mo. _Printed by       Elzevir._         In the Bibliotheca Revickzkiana we are informed that the       _true_ Elzevir edition is known by having the plate of a       Buffalo's head at the beginning of the preface, and body of       the work: also by having the page numbered 153, which       _ought_ to have been numbered 149. A further account is       given in my Introduction to the Classics, vol. i., 228.         _Horace_: Londini, 1733, 8vo., 2 vols. Published by Pine.

The _true_ edition is known by having at plate 1, before the       Bucolics, the following Latin passage _printed in red ink_.       \"Ego vero frequentes a te litteras accipi\"--Consult De Bure,       No. 2684.         _Idem._ Birmingh. 1763, 4to. Printed by Baskerville.         A particular account of the _true_ edition will be found in       the second volume of my 'Introduction to the Classics' p.       337--too long to be here inserted.         _Boccaccio._ Il Decamerone, Venet. 1527, 4to.

Bibl. Paris. No. 408. Clement. (vol. iv., 352,)       has abundance of references, as usual, to strengthen his       assertion in calling the edition 'fort rare.' The reprint or       spurious edition has always struck me as the prettier book       of the two.]    VIII. Books printed in the _Black Letter_. Of all symptoms of the  Bibliomania, this eighth symptom (and the last which I shall notice)  is at present the most powerful and prevailing. Whether it was not  imported into this country from Holland, by the subtlety of  Schelhorn[66] (a knowing writer upon rare and curious books) may be  shrewdly suspected. Whatever be its origin, certain it is, my dear  Sir, that books printed in the black letter are now coveted with an  eagerness unknown to our collectors in the last century. If the  spirits of West, Ratcliffe, Farmer and Brand, have as yet held any  intercourse with each other, in that place 'from whose bourne no  traveller returns,' what must be the surprise of the three former, on  being told by the latter, of the prices given for some of the books in  his library, as mentioned below!?[67]         [Footnote 66: His words are as follow: \"Ipsa typorum       ruditas, ipsa illa atra crassaque literarum facies _belle       tangit sensus, &c._\" Was ever the black letter more       eloquently described?

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#16)"],[1," inserting induction coils at  intervals along the cables the currents may be \"stepped up\" from point  to point, and so get across. Turning to Fig. 64, we may suppose S to be  on shore at the English end, and S_2 to be the _primary_ winding of an  induction coil a hundred miles away in the sea, which magnifies the  enfeebled vibrations for a journey to S_3, where they are again  revived; and so on, till the New World is reached. The difficulty is to  devise induction coils of great power though of small size. Yet science  advances nowadays so fast that we may live to hear words spoken at the  Antipodes.

A simple dynamo--Continuous-current dynamos--Multipolar       dynamos--Exciting the field magnets--Alternating current       dynamos--The transmission of power--The electric motor--Electric       lighting--The incandescent lamp--Arc lamps--\"Series\" and \"parallel\"       arrangement of lamps--Current for electric lamps--Electroplating.      In previous chapters we have incidentally referred to the conversion of  mechanical work into electrical energy. In this we shall examine how it  is done--how the silently spinning dynamo develops power, and why the  motor spins when current is passed through it.    We must begin by returning to our first electrical diagram (Fig. 50),  and calling to mind the invisible \"lines of force\" which permeate the  ether in the immediate neighbourhood of a magnet's poles, called the  _magnetic field_ of the magnet.    Many years ago (1831) the great Michael Faraday discovered that if a  loop of wire were moved up and down between the poles of an  electro-magnet (Fig. 66) a current was induced in the loop, its  direction depending upon that in which the loop was moved. The energy  required to cut the lines of force passed in some mysterious way into  the wire. Why this is so we cannot say, but, taking advantage of the  fact, electricians have gradually developed the enormous machines which  now send vehicles spinning over metal tracks, light our streets and  houses, and supply energy to innumerable factories.    [Illustration: FIG. 66.]    The strength of the current induced in a circuit cutting the lines of  force of a magnet is called its pressure, voltage, or electro-motive  force (expressed shortly E.M.F.). It may be compared with the  pounds-to-the-square-inch of steam. In order to produce an E.M.F. of one  volt it is calculated that 100,000,000 lines of force must be cut every  second.    The voltage depends on three things:--(1.) The _strength_ of the magnet:  the stronger it is, the greater the number of lines of force coming from  it. (2.) The _length_ of the conductor cutting the lines of force: the  longer it is, the more lines it will cut. (3.) The _speed_ at which the  conductor moves: the faster it travels, the more lines it will cut in a  given time. It follows that a powerful dynamo, or mechanical producer of  current, must have strong magnets and a long conductor; and the latter  must be moved at a high speed across the lines of force.      A SIMPLE DYNAMO.    In Fig. 67 we have the simplest possible form of dynamo--a single turn  of wire, _w x y z_, mounted on a spindle, and having one end attached to  an insulated ring C, the other to an insulated ring C^1. Two small  brushes, B B^1, of wire gauze or carbon, rubbing continuously against  these collecting rings, connect them with a wire which completes the  circuit. The armature, as the revolving coil is called, is mounted  between the poles of a magnet, where the lines of force are thickest.  These lines are _supposed_ to stream from the N. to the S. pole.    In Fig. 67 the armature has reached a position in which _y z_ and _w x_  are cutting no, or very few, lines of force, as they move practically  parallel to the lines. This is called the _zero_ position.    [Illustration: FIG. 67.]    [Illustration: FIG. 68.]    In Fig. 68 the armature, moving at right angles to the lines of force,  cuts a maximum number in a given time, and the current induced in the  coil is therefore now most intense. Here we must stop a moment to  consider how to decide in which direction the current flows. The  armature is revolving in a clockwise direction, and _y z_, therefore, is  moving downwards. Now, suppose that you rest your _left_ hand on the N.  pole of the magnet so that the arm lies in a line with the magnet. Point  your forefinger towards the S. pole. It will indicate the _direction of  the lines of force_. Bend your other three fingers downwards over the  edge of the N. pole. They will indicate the _direction in which the  conductor is moving_ across the magnetic field. Stick out the thumb at  right angles to the forefinger. It points in the direction in which the  _induced_ current is moving through the nearer half of the coil.  Therefore lines of force, conductor, and induced current travel in  planes which, like the top and two adjacent sides of a box, are at right  angles to one another.    While current travels from _z_ to _y_--that is, _from_ the ring C^1 to  _y_--it also travels from _x_ to _w_, because _w x_ rises while _y z_  descends. So that a current circulates through the coil and the exterior  part of the circuit, including the lamp. After _z y_ has passed the  lowest possible point of the circle it begins to ascend, _w x_ to  descend. The direction of the current is therefore reversed; and as the  change is repeated every half-revolution this form of dynamo is called  an _alternator_ or creator of alternating currents. A well-known type of  alternator is the magneto machine which sends shocks through any one who  completes the external circuit by holding the brass handles connected by  wires to the brushes. The faster the handle of the machine is turned the  more frequent is the alternation, and the stronger the current.    [Illustration: FIG. 69.]      CONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS.    An alternating current is not so convenient for some purposes as a  continuous current. It is therefore sometimes desirable (even necessary)  to convert the alternating into a uni-directional or continuous current.  How this is done is shown in Figs. 69 and 70. In place of the two  collecting rings C C^1, we now have a single ring split longitudinally  into two portions, one of which is connected to each end of the coil _w  x y z_. In Fig. 69 brush B has just passed the gap on to segment C,  brush B^1 on to segment C^1. For half a revolution these remain  respectively in contact; then, just as _y z_ begins to rise and _w x_ to  descend, the brushes cross the gaps again and exchange segments, so that  the current is perpetually flowing one way through the circuit. The  effect of the commutator[17] is, in fact, equivalent to transposing the  brushes of the collecting rings of the alternator every time the coil  reaches a zero position.    Figs. 71 and 72 give end views in section of the coil and the  commutator, with the coil in the position of minimum and maximum  efficiency. The arrow denotes the direction of movement; the double  dotted lines the commutator end of the revolving coil.    [Illustration: FIG. 70.]      PRACTICAL CONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS.    The electrical output of our simple dynamo would be increased if,  instead of a single turn of wire, we used a coil of many turns. A  further improvement would result from mounting on the shaft, inside the  coil, a core or drum of iron, to entice the lines of force within reach  of the revolving coil. It is evident that any lines which pass through  the air outside the circle described by the coil cannot be cut, and are  wasted.    [Illustration: FIG. 71.]    [Illustration: FIG. 72.]    The core is not a solid mass of iron, but built up of a number of very  thin iron discs threaded on the shaft and insulated from one another to  prevent electric eddies, which would interfere with the induced current  in the conductor.[18] Sometimes there are openings through the core from  end to end to ventilate and cool it.    [Illustration: FIG. 73.]    We have already noticed that in the case of a single coil the current  rises and falls in a series of pulsations. Such a form of armature would  be unsuitable for large dynamos, which accordingly have a number of  coils wound over their drums, at equal distances round the  circumference, and a commutator divided into an equal number of  segments. The subject of drum winding is too complicated for brief  treatment, and we must therefore be content with noticing that the coils  are so connected to their respective commutator segments and to one  another that they mutually assist one another. A glance at Fig. 73 will  help to explain this. Here we have in section a number of conductors on  the right of the drum (marked with a cross to show that current is  moving, as it were, into the page), connected with conductors on the  left (marked with a dot to signify current coming out of the page). If  the \"crossed\" and \"dotted\" conductors were respectively the \"up\" and  \"down\" turns of a single coil terminating in a simple split commutator  (Fig. 69), when the coil had been revolved through an angle of 90 deg.  some of the up turns would be ascending and some descending, so that  conflicting currents would arise. Yet we want to utilize the whole  surface of the drum; and by winding a number of coils in the manner  hinted at, each coil, as it passes the zero point, top or bottom, at  once generates a current in the desired direction and reinforces that in  all the other turns of its own and of other coils on the same side of a  line drawn vertically through the centre. There is thus practically no  fluctuation in the pressure of the current generated.    The action of single and multiple coil windings may be compared to that  of single and multiple pumps."]]]
