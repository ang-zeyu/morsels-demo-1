Indeed,  after weeks of absence from places where money is of value we all share  in this rejuvenation, and if you had been in Bloemfontein on any one of  these fine days you would have seen men of every age and rank, from  generals to trumpeters, wandering about the streets, agape at the shop  windows, chinking their money in their pockets, and buying things for  which they had no kind of use.    The British officer afield is a very different creature from the gilded  ornament of an English mess. His face is scorched and peeled, he is  generally (unless he be a staff officer) very ill-clad; he has a ragged  beard; he esteems golden syrup the greatest luxury on earth; he ceases  to be ashamed of originality in thought or expression; he altogether  fails to disguise what a good fellow he is. But in a very short time the  neighbourhood of a club, the possibility of a bath, the presence of  barbers and tailors, by a mysterious and marvellous working, reverse his  development, and the little graces which endear him to society at home  begin to reappear. So long as the sole of his boot was tied to the  uppers by a piece of string, he could not look you in the face with any  pretending; but when the cobbler has done his office, and the tailor has  sewn up the rent breeches, the spell is broken.    We \"occupied\" Bloemfontein so completely that, after the first few days,  I was glad to take the road again. We occupied the club, we occupied the  shops and hotels, we occupied even the homes of the simple townspeople;  and we occupied the streets, so that all day the town resounded to the  din of tramping feet. When one has slept for a month under the stars,  sheets and a roof are stifling; so as the railway was not yet open,  Major Pollock (of _The Times_) and I decided to go to Kimberley by road,  assured that the moral effect of the proclamation would keep us out of  danger from the Queen's enemies.    Our little caravan set forth by moonlight, taking the road travelled by  the left-hand column of the three parallel columns that had advanced on  Bloemfontein, and somewhat to the north of that taken by Lord Roberts  and the central column, with which we had gone in. The journey itself  was uneventful enough, full of the little interests and anxieties and  pleasures of the road, full of joy for the travellers, but without  serious interest to anyone else. There was just enough risk of  encountering a commando to give the necessary spice of adventure; two  despatch-riders--not mine, by the good fortune of half a mile--had been  captured the day before, and we kept a bright look-out. But by the time  we came across them the commandos were forlornly[2] dispersing. For the  rest, there was the unending charm of the climate and the place; the  gorgeous evenings, when sunset and moonrise encircled the horizon in a  flame of gold and silver; the spring-cold mornings, with the veldt  glowing from violet to purple and crimson; the noonday rest in some  deserted farm garden; the bed at nightfall, with the sound of horses  munching their corn for a lullaby--all the circumstances of simple  travel accomplished by the means that nature has provided. After having  been for so long in the company of 30,000 men we found the loneliness  and quietness refreshing, and we passed almost unnoticed through the  birds and beasts and flowers. We swam once more in the muddy Modder, now  quite an old friend. The track of the army was marked for us in two  ways--one ludicrous, the other tragic; both unmistakable. For all along  the way bright tin biscuit canisters of the Army Service Corps shone  like diamonds in the sun; and all along the way, at intervals, tired and  sick old cavalry horses stood by the roadside, each surrounded by a  crowd of foul aasvoegels, the vultures of South Africa, waiting.    [Footnote 2: For the time being.]    The chief party of Boers which we encountered was at Abraham's Kraal.  While we were breakfasting about two dozen of them cantered up, of whom  about six were armed. If I had qualms, I hope I did not show them when I  said \"Good-morning.\" I fell into conversation with one of the Boers, and  mentioned incidentally that, from their point of view, the game was up,  and that I supposed he knew that anyone who interfered with peaceful  Englishmen would be hanged. He was a sulky fellow, but he took my word  for it, and presently we began to talk. These Boers were in low spirits  about the war, and spoke of it without enthusiasm or hope. Most of them  were Transvaalers, and two spoke with an unmistakable Glasgow accent,  but on the whole they were gruff and uncommunicative, and, as they cast  envious eyes from their own sorry nags to our well-conditioned mounts,  I was glad to wish them good-day. They had come to bury the dead from  the Dreifontein fight, and from what they told me of the still unburied  Boers both there and at Paardeberg, I gathered that their casualties all  along the line had been heavier than we had thought.    I have said that the neighbourhood of the Boers made our journey  exciting, and there was one point at which the excitement became very  nearly painful. We had made a long stage one day, and at about sundown  arrived at the Modder, which we intended to cross at a drift near  Koodoesrand. This was the dangerous neighbourhood, and we were anxious  to push on and cross the river before encamping for the night. The banks  of the Modder at this drift are about forty feet high and almost  precipitous, the path down to the drift being little better than a track  worn at a long diagonal down the bank. It was steep enough going down,  but when we had crossed the shallow river and begun the ascent of the  other bank we found the track very soft and almost perpendicular. By  fetching a compass and putting the horses to it at a great pace the two  Cape carts managed to reach the top, but a four-wheeled American waggon  stuck fast at the bottom and could not be moved. At that moment the last  of the daylight ebbed, and darkness began to quench the sunset embers.    We tried unhitching the teams from the Cape carts and hitching them to  the waggon, but we only succeeded in breaking harness. It was after the  second attempt, when we were all standing hot and angry after our  unavailing exertion of whip-cracking and shouting, that we suddenly saw  a light shine out from the edge of a low kopje about two miles in front  of us. One of us lost his head, and by speaking his fears communicated  the malady.    \"There are the Boers,\" he said, \"and if they haven't heard us yelling  they must have seen the light from our lanterns. The sooner we get out  of this the better.\"    There was nothing for it but to unload the waggon and carry the contents  up by hand, and this we did in an agony of excitement, staggering and  sweating up the steep path with portmanteaus, beds, valises, cases of  tinned provisions, kettles, bottles, saucepans, bags of harness, oats,  and guns. The empty waggon was easily drawn up to the top, and then we  must reload it again with a burden which seemed to have swollen  enormously since it was unpacked. We were working so frantically that we  had not even time to look at the kopje, but when at length I glanced at  it I saw that a strange thing had happened.    The light was now suspended about thirty feet above the hill.    Had they a balloon? Major Pollock and I gazed blankly for more than a  minute at that mysterious shining, which seemed to rise higher and  higher. More than a minute: just so long did it take us to remember that  Orion rises low in the west!    Now for what will remain with me as the crowning impression of this  journey. The road we took led through a fairly fertile country, and that  in the Free State means that there generally was grass instead of karoo.  There were many farms; we probably passed twenty in the course of ninety  miles. Each of those farms I visited, and at each stood aghast at the  ruin that had been wrought. Signs of looting one expected--the looting  of food-stuffs and livestock and necessaries; that, after all, is but a  kind of self-defence, and I suppose it is allowable to live upon an  enemy when one invades his land. But the destruction that had here taken  place was wanton and savage. One seemed to travel in the footsteps of  some fiend who had left his mark upon every home, destroying the things  that were probably most prized by the owners, and destroying with a  devilish ingenuity that had saved him all unnecessary labour. For  example, in one little farmhouse I found a flimsy, showy, London bedroom  suite that was clearly the pride of the establishment, with its wardrobe  and full-length mirror. The destroyer had smashed just what could not be  mended--the mirror and the marble top of the washstand. In another  cottage I found an old clock that had ticked, most likely, for years on  end in the quietness of the little home; its hands were torn off, and  its works strewn upon the floor. In every house the little bits of  rubbish that adorn the homes of the poor were destroyed or disfigured;  in all were the same signs of violation, the same marks of the beast.    It has always seemed to me that a little farm in a lonely country  contains more than anything else the atmosphere of a home. It is  self-centred; there you see all the little shifts and contrivances which  result from the forced supplying of wants that cannot be satisfied from  outside. And when such a homestead is deserted, I think the atmosphere  is only the more pronounced; the disused implements find voices in the  silence and cry aloud for their absent owners. But when all that is  personal and human in such a place is ruined, the pathos turns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#16)"],[1,"e. The  rest was debris.    The church in the foreground was recognizable as such by the shape and  size of its ragged walls, and by a half-smashed image of the Virgin and  Child which slanted out at a perilous angle above its facade.    Yet, miserable as the ruined hamlet seemed to the casual eye, it was at  present a vacation-resort--and a decidedly welcome one--to no less than  three thousand tired men. The wrecked church was an impromptu hospital  beneath whose shattered roof dozens of these men lay helpless on  makeshift cots.    For the mixed American and French regiment known as the \"Here-We-Comes\"  was billeted at Meran-en-Laye during a respite from the rigors and  perils of the front-line trenches.    The rest and the freedom from risks, supposed to be a part of the  \"billeting\" system, were not wholly the portion of the \"Here-We Comes.\"  Meran--en--Laye was just then a somewhat important little speck on the  warmap.    The Germans had been up to their favorite field sport of trying to  split in half two of the Allied armies, and to roll up each,  independently. The effort had been a failure; yet it had come so near  to success that many railway communications were cut off or deflected.  And Meran-en-Laye had for the moment gained new importance, by virtue  of a spur railway-line which ran through its outskirts and which made  junction with a new set of tracks the American engineers were  completing. Along this transverse of roads much ammunition and food and  many fighting men were daily rushed.    The safety of the village had thus become of much significance. While  it was too far behind the lines to be in grave danger of enemy raids,  yet such danger existed to some extent. Wherefore the presence of the  \"Here-We-Comes\"--for the paradoxical double purpose of \"resting up\" and  of guarding the railway Function.    Still, it was better than trench-work; and the \"Here-We-Comes\" enjoyed  it--for a day or so. Then trouble had set in.    A group of soldiers were lounging on the stone seat in front of the  village estaminet. Being off duty, they were reveling in that popular  martial pastime known to the Tommy as \"grousing\" and to the Yankee  doughboy as \"airing a grouch.\"    Top-Sergeant Mahan, formerly of the regular army, was haranguing the  others. Some listened approvingly, others dissentingly and others not  at all.    \"I tell you,\" Mahan declared for the fourth time, \"somebody's  double-crossing us again. There's a leak. And if they don't find out  where it is, a whole lot of good men and a million dollars' worth of  supplies are liable to spill out through that same leak. It--\"    \"But,\" argued his crony, old Sergeant Vivier, in his hard-learned  English, \"but it may all be of a chance, mon vieux. It may, not be the  doubled cross,--whatever a doubled cross means,--but the mere chance.  Such things often--\"    \"Chance, my grandmother's wall-eyed cat!\" snorted Mahan. \"Maybe it  might have been chance--when this place hadn't been bombed for a  month--for a whole flight of boche artillery and airship grenades to  cut loose against it the day General Pershing happened to stop here for  an hour on his way to Chateau-Thierry. Maybe that was chance--though I  know blamed well it wasn't. Maybe it was chance that the place wasn't  bombed again till two days ago, when that troop-train had to spend such  a lot of time getting shunted at the junction. Maybe it was chance that  the church, over across the street, hadn't been touched since the last  drive, till our regiment's wounded were put in it--and that it's been  hit three times since then. Maybe any one of those things--and of a  dozen others was chance. But it's a cinch that ALL of them weren't  chance. Chance doesn't work that way. I--\"    \"Perhaps,\" doubtfully assented old Vivier, \"perhaps. But I little like  to believe it. For it means a spy. And a spy in one's midst is like to  a snake in one's blankets. It is a not pleasing comrade. And it stands  in sore need of killing.\"    \"There's spies everywhere,\" averred Mahan. \"That's been proved often  enough. So why not here? But I wish to the Lord I could lay hands on  him! If this was one of the little sheltered villages, in a valley, his  work would be harder. And the boche airships and the long-rangers  wouldn't find us such a simple target. But up here on this ridge, all a  spy has to do is to flash a signal, any night, that a boche airman can  pick up or that can even be seen with good glasses from some high point  where it can be relayed to the German lines. The guy who laid out this  burg was sure thoughtless. He might have known there'd be a war some  day. He might even have strained his mind and guessed that we'd be  stuck here. Gee!\"    He broke off with a grunt of disgust; nor did he so much as listen to  another of the group who sought to lure him into an opinion as to  whether the spy might be an inhabitant of the village or a  camp-follower.    Sucking at his pipe; the Sergeant glowered moodily down the ruined  street. The village drowsed under the hot midday. Here and there a  soldier lounged along aimlessly or tried out his exercise-book French  on some puzzled, native. Now and then an officer passed in or out of  the half-unroofed mairie which served as regimental headquarters.    Beyond, in the handkerchief-sized village square, a platoon was  drilling. A thin French housewife was hanging sheets on a line behind a  shell-twisted hovel. A Red Cross nurse came out of the hospital-church  across the street from the estaminet and seated herself on the stone  steps with a basketful of sewing.    Mahan's half-shut eyes rested critically on the drilling  platoon--amusedly on the woman who was so carefully hanging the ragged  sheets,--and then approvingly upon the Red Cross nurse on the church  steps across the way.    Mahan, like most other soldiers, honored and revered the Red Cross for  its work of mercy in the army. And the sight of one of the several  local nurses of the Order won from him a glance of real approbation.    But presently into his weather-beaten face came an expression of glad  welcome. Out of the mairie gate and into the sleepy warmth of the  street lounged a huge dark-brown-and-white collie. The don stretched  himself lazily, fore and aft, in true collie style, then stood gazing  about him as if in search of something of interest to occupy his bored  attention.    \"Hello!\" observed Mahan, breaking in on a homily of Vivier's. \"There's  Bruce!\"    Vivier's leathery face brightened at sound of the collie's name. He  looked eagerly in the direction of Mahan's pointing finger.    \"Ce brave!\" exclaimed the Frenchman. \"I did not know even that he was  in the village. It must be he is but new-arriven. Otherwise he would,  of an assuredly, have hunted up his old friends. Ohe, Bruce!\" he called  invitingly.    \"The big dog must have gotten here just a few minutes ago,\" said  Sergeant Mahan. \"He was coming out of headquarters when I saw him. That  must mean he's just struck the town, and with a message for the K.O. He  always goes like greased lightning when he's on dispatch duty, till he  has delivered his message. Then, if he's to be allowed to hang around a  while before he's sent back, he loafs, lazy-like; the way you see him  now. If all the courier-dogs were like him, every human courier would  be out of a job.\"    At Vivier's hail the great collie had pricked his ears and glanced  inquiringly up and down the street. Catching sight of the group seated  in front of the estaminet, he began to wag his plumy tail and set off  toward them at a trot.    Ten minutes earlier, Bruce had cantered into Meran-en-Laye from the  opposite end of the street, bearing in his collar a dispatch from the  corps commander to the colonel of the \"Here-We-Comes.\" The colonel, at  the mairie, had read the dispatch and had patted its bearer; then had  bidden the dog lie down and rest, if he chose, after his long run.    Instead, Bruce had preferred to stroll out in search of friends.    Top-Sergeant Mahan, by the way, would have felt highly flattered had he  chanced to get a glimpse of the dispatch Bruce had brought to the  colonel. For it bore out Mahan's own theory regarding the presence of  spies at or near the village, and it bade the \"Here-We-Come\" colonel  use every means for tracing them.    It added the information that three troop-trains with nine engines were  to pass through the village that night on their way to the trenches,  and that the trains were due at the junction at nine o'clock or shortly  thereafter. The mairie was on the other side of the street from the  estaminet. Incidentally, it was on the shady side of the street--for  which reason Bruce,--being wise, and the day being hot,--remained on  that side, until he should come opposite the bench where his friends  awaited him.    His course, thus, brought him directly past the church.    As he trotted by the steps, the Red Cross nurse, who sat sewing there,  chirped timidly at him. Bruce paused in his leisurely progress to see  who had accosted him whether an old acquaintance, to be greeted as  such, or merely a pleasantly inclined stranger.    His soft brown eyes rested first in idle inquiry upon the angular and  white-robed figure on the steps. Then, on the instant, the friendly  inquiring look left his eyes and their softness went with it--leaving  the dog's gaze cold and frankly hostile.    One corner of Bruce's lips slowly lifted, revealing a tiny view of the  terrible white fangs behind them. His gayly erect head was lowered, and  in the depths of his furry throat a growl was born. When a dog barks  and holds his head up, there is little enough to fear from him. But  when he lowers his head and growl--then look out.    Mahan knew dogs. In stark amazement he now noted Bruce's strange  attitude toward the nurse. Never before had he seen the dog show active  hostility toward a stranger--least of all toward a stranger who had in"]]]
