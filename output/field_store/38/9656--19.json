But as both forms      of peloria frequently occur on the same individual plant of the      Linaria,[132] they probably stand in some close relation to each other.      On the doctrine that peloria is simply the result of an arrest of      development, it is difficult to understand how an organ arrested at a      very early period of growth should acquire its full functional      perfection;--how a petal, supposed to be thus arrested, should acquire      its brilliant colours, and serve as an envelope to the flower, or a      stamen produce efficient pollen; yet this occurs with many peloric      flowers. That pelorism is not due to mere chance variability, but      either to an arrest of development or to reversion, we may infer from      an observation made by Ch. Morren,[133] namely, that families which      have irregular flowers often \"return by these monstrous growths to      their regular form; whilst we never see a regular flower realise the      structure of an irregular one.\"        Some flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely      peloric through reversion. _Corydalis tuberosa_ properly has one of its      two nectaries colourless, destitute of nectar, only half the size of      the other, and {59} therefore, to a certain extent, in a rudimentary      state; the pistil is curved towards the perfect nectary, and the hood,      formed of the inner petals, slips off the pistil and stamens in one      direction alone, so that, when a bee sucks the perfect nectary, the      stigma and stamens are exposed and rubbed against the insect's body. In      several closely allied genera, as in Dielytra, &c., there are two      perfect nectaries, the pistil is straight, and the hood slips off on      either side, according as the bee sucks either nectary. Now, I have      examined several flowers of _Corydalis tuberosa_, in which both      nectaries were equally developed and contained nectar; in this we see      only the redevelopment of a partially aborted organ; but with this      redevelopment the pistil becomes straight, and the hood slips off in      either direction; so that these flowers have acquired the perfect      structure, so well adapted for insect agency, of Dielytra and its      allies. We cannot attribute these coadapted modifications to chance, or      to correlated variability; we must attribute them to reversion to a      primordial condition of the species.        The peloric flowers of Pelargonium have their five petals in all      respects alike, and there is no nectary; so that they resemble the      symmetrical flowers of the closely allied Geranium-genus; but the      alternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers, the      shortened filaments being left as rudiments, and in this respect they      resemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus, Erodium.      Hence we are led to look at the peloric flowers of Pelargonium as      having probably reverted to the state of some primordial form, the      progenitor of the three closely related genera of Pelargonium,      Geranium, and Erodium.        In the peloric form of _Antirrhinum majus_, appropriately called the      \"_Wonder_,\" the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from      those of the common snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla      consist of six equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four      unequal stamens. One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed      by the development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be      found at the base of the upper lip of the flower in all common      snapdragons, at least in nineteen plants examined by me. That this      papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees      of development in crossed plants between the common and peloric      Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric _Galeobdolon luteum_, growing in my      garden, had five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip,      and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R.      Keeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that the flowers vary      greatly, having from four to six lobes to the corolla, and from three      to six stamens.[134] Now, as the members of the two great families to      which the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous,      with some of the parts confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to      look at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either      case as due to reversion, any more than the additional petals in double      flowers in these same two families. But the case is different with the      fifth stamen in the peloric Antirrhinum, which {60} is produced by the      redevelopment of a rudiment always present, and which probably reveals      to us the state of the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at      some ancient epoch. It is also difficult to believe that the other four      stamens and the petals, after an arrest of development at a very early      embryonic age, would have come to full perfection in colour, structure,      and function, unless these organs had at some former period normally      passed through a similar course of growth. Hence it appears to me      probable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some      remote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some      degree resembling those now produced by the peloric form.        Lastly, I may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers,      not generally ranked as peloric, in which certain organs, normally few      in number, have been abnormally augmented. As such an increase of parts      cannot be looked at as an arrest of development, nor as due to the      redevelopment of rudiments, for no rudiments are present, and as these      additional parts bring the plant into closer relationship with its      natural allies, they ought probably to be viewed as reversions to a      primordial condition.    These several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately certain  abnormal states are connected together; namely, arrests of development  causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly suppressed,--the  redevelopment of parts at present in a more or less rudimentary  condition,--the reappearance of organs of which not a vestige can now be  detected,--and to these may be added, in the case of animals, the presence  during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of certain characters which  occasionally are retained throughout life. Some naturalists look at all  such abnormal structures as a return to the ideal state of the group to  which the affected being belongs; but it is difficult to conceive what is  meant to be conveyed by this expression. Other naturalists maintain, with  greater probability and distinctness of view, that the common bond of  connection between the several foregoing cases is an actual, though  partial, return to the structure of the ancient progenitor of the group. If  this view be correct, we must believe that a vast number of characters,  capable of evolution, lie hidden in every organic being. But it would be a  mistake to suppose that the number is equally great in all beings. We know,  for instance, that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric; but  many more cases have been observed in the Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae  than in any other order; and in one genus of the Scrophulariaceae, namely  Linaria, no less {61} than thirteen species have been described in a  peloric condition.[135] On this view of the nature of peloric flowers, and  bearing in mind what has been said with respect to certain monstrosities in  the animal kingdom, we must conclude that the progenitors of most plants  and animals, though widely different in structure, have left an impression  capable of redevelopment on the germs of their descendants.    The fertilised germ of one of the higher animals, subjected as it is to so  vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old age,--incessantly  agitated by what Quatrefages well calls the _tourbillon vital_,--is perhaps  the most wonderful object in nature. It is probable that hardly a change of  any kind affects either parent, without some mark being left on the germ.  But on the doctrine of reversion, as given in this chapter, the germ  becomes a far more marvellous object, for, besides the visible changes to  which it is subjected, we must believe that it is crowded with invisible  characters, proper to both sexes, to both the right and left side of the  body, and to a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds  or even thousands of generations from the present time; and these  characters, like those written on paper with invisible ink, all lie ready  to be evolved under certain known or unknown conditions.           *       *       *       *       *      {62}    CHAPTER XIV.
