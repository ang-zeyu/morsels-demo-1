We had to travel over  newly-made ice a distance of three miles to a small island about a  mile long and quite narrow, on which were three small groves of fir  trees which was the only cover for game, the surface of the island  being chiefly meadow and marsh land. We landed on the eastern end of  the island, and within a short time after the hunt began one of the  party shot a fox, and in the afternoon the writer got a chance at a  shot and succeeded in knocking over a very fine red fox. As night was  now near we started for home, intending to return next day and renew  the hunt, as we knew there was yet another fox on the island. Next  day, however, was stormy, and we postponed the hunt till the  following day, which being fine gave us a good chance for our work.      [Illustration: ALWAYS HUNGRY.]    The same party of hunters and dogs renewed the chase early in the  morning but the fox seemed to have learned a lesson from the previous  hunt, and all day long he was chased from grove to grove by the dogs  without giving a chance of a shot at him. As night was fast  approaching we began to fear our hunt was going to be unsuccessful  when we discovered that the fox had changed his tactics, and instead  of taking shelter in the groves had run clear out to one end of the  island, which was very narrow, and as we thought would take to the  ice and thus get away from us. However, we followed after him, and  you may imagine our surprise when the fox, instead of going on the  ice, suddenly turned around and came directly toward us, and when  about one hundred yards distant suddenly disappeared as if the earth  had swallowed him up; one of the party who knew there was an old  uncovered well there shouted out, \"the fox is in the well!\" We all  hastened to the spot, and sure enough there was Mr. Fox in the well  clinging to some sticks floating in the water about eight feet below  the surface of the ground. As we had no rope or any facilities for  getting reynard out of the well alive, we had to take a mean and  unsportsmanlike advantage of our prisoner by putting a small charge  of shot into his head and then fishing him out of the water with a  forked stick. That the fox could never have gotten out of the well by  his own exertions I do not believe, but that he went into it to  escape from us is certain.        CHAPTER XX.    STILL-HUNTING THE FOX.    Many have requested me to give my method of still-hunting the red  fox. As my hair is turning gray and the red foxes are about all gone  here I will give an outline of my method, and will try and not weary  the reader with a long account, thus writes G. O. Green, of Illinois.    Winter is the best time for hunting the red fox, and I have been more  successful in January and February than other months. There are  always some localities where the red fox spends the day, curled up  asleep, and it is generally in a hilly locality as far as he can get  from the presence of man.    The still hunter has only to go to these places on fair days and hunt  as far as possible against the wind. If the wind is blowing some so  much the better--it will help to deaden the sound of the hunter's  tread. When you get into likely ground walk slow, and be sure you  observe every object on the ground, both in front and in fact at  least three sides. The average still hunter hunts too fast and don't  use his eyes in the right direction--if he is a bird hunter he will  be looking up in the trees too much.      [Illustration: BLACK FOX SKIN VALUED AT $1500.]    A red fox is a small animal, and the hunter must keep his eyes always  on the ground while hunting the old Red. If snow is on the ground and  the hunter jumps a fox without getting a shot, the hunter, if he is a  novice, will be pretty sure to go on the run after the fox when he  comes to the place where the fox has just jumped. When you find the  fox has been jumped sit right down and eat your lunch, and wait  twenty minutes or a half hour. The fox will run perhaps 80 rods then  get on a log or stump and watch his back track, and if he does not  see any one following him he will not go far before he will look for  another place to lie down.    When you come to a place where the fox makes zigzag trail, stop and  look very close in every direction for at least one hundred yards.  The fox rarely makes a straight trail when he is going to lie down;  in this he resembles the deer. The fox sleeps most soundly between 11  o'clock and 2 o'clock in the daytime, and I have killed most of mine  during that time. A fox jumped after 3 o'clock in the afternoon will  hardly lie down again that day. A double-barrel shotgun loaded with  No. 4 shot will stop any fox up to about 50 yards; above that  distance coarser shot usually straddle the fox. When the day is cold  and snow is crusty, stay at home, for you will get no fox but plenty  of exercise.    When a fox goes into the ground while you are trailing him, don't try  to dig him out; it is hard work. On three occasions I have got his  brush by going to the burrow about sundown and getting a good  position near the burrow to wait for him to come out. I have never  been disappointed in getting a shot about the time that you can see  half a dozen stars twinkling. But it takes good eyes to see a fox in  twilight.    Now reader, these are not all the points of still hunting. It takes a  peculiar cuss for a still hunter, and still hunters are born that  way; all the education in the world will not make a still hunter.        CHAPTER XXI.    FOX RANCHES.    It is estimated that at present nearly 50 of the Aleutian Islands  have fox ranches, most of which are said to have been successfully  managed. Thus far the Government has rented the islands for this  purpose at $100 per year. Some years ago the revenue cutter Perry was  sent to the Archipelago by the Treasury Department for the express  purpose of ascertaining the location of the islands used for fox  ranches. The Government's agents were not long in finding out that in  several instances the fox raisers had appropriated islands for which  they were paying no rental. These persons were brought up with a  sharp turn and ordered to pay up or shut up shop.    It seems quite clear that where proper business methods have been  followed the ranches, without exception, have succeeded thus far, and  will prove immensely valuable in the future. On some of the islands  the work has been going on for 12 or 15 years, and three of them now  have a fox population of more than 1,000 each. The first method was  to begin operations by turning loose on an island several pairs of  foxes. In some instances the animals have increased rapidly, with the  result that in a year or so it had become apparent that $150 or $200  paid for a pair of mated animals was likely to prove a good  investment.      [Illustration: NORTHERN FOX TRAPPER'S DOG TEAM.]    The original project was to breed the silver gray fox, as the fur of  this animal is much more valuable than that of the commoner  varieties. A good silver gray pelt is worth about $50 to the original  seller, while $15 or thereabout is the price for the pelt of the blue  fox. But the silver gray has many peculiarities which make its  domestication exceedingly difficult, practically impossible, in fact.  It is much given to devouring its young, and it has many of the  characteristics of the wolf. At present only one of the islands is  given up to the silver grays, and the animals do not increase  rapidly.    The blue fox, so called, is handled much more successfully. It is  readily tamed, and if kindly treated soon becomes so domestic that it  will take food from the keeper's hand. The food usually is fish,  either cooked or raw, and a mixture of corn meal and tallow. Reynard  gets these rations, and all he wants of them, for ten months in the  year, the food being supplied steadily except during the two  midsummer months. It is estimated that the average cost of the  rations is $1.50 per fox per year. There are two or three keepers for  each ranch who devote all their time the year around to their  charges.    From November 20 to January 20 is the open season for foxes on the  islands, and box traps, rather than dead falls or steel traps, are  used. This is done because all the female animals are released, after  having been marked, and also one male for every six of the opposite  sex. The average age for killing is about 18 months, although the  pelt of an animal eight months old is fully developed, and, despite  some theories to the contrary, the fur does not necessarily improve  with age. On some of the larger farms, the box trap method of  catching the foxes has been given up, as being too slow, for baiting  the animals near a small corral.    During the months preceding the killing time, the food for the foxes  is placed near the site of this corral, in order to accustom the  animals to coming to that locality, and also in order to tame them.  Under this treatment the foxes lose their shyness and shrewdness to  such an extent that they not only enter the corral freely, but the  female or male which has once been released after having been  examined and marked, frequently enters the corral again. It is  reported that in some instances the same animal has been caught three  or four times in the same night.        CHAPTER XXII.    STEEL TRAPS.    In sections the larger game is gone yet there is in parts of the  North, West and South much good trapping territory that will pay the  hardy trappers for years to come. Even in the more thickly settled  districts trapping can be made a good paying business. It seems that  red fox, skunk and muskrat remain about as numerous in most sections  as ever. In fact, the red fox in certain sections has only made its  appearance of late years--since the country has become more thickly  settled. Trappers in most sections can rest assured that they will  have game to trap for years to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#16)"],[1," too wide  for them to jump forms a most killing set. Drive a few stakes on each  side of a log at the ends to prevent the animal from jumping shore to  one side of trap, and use extra strong traps, as you are likely to  drop on a fox or coon with this set. No bait is needed. In winter any  spring hole, even if near human habitations, offers good  possibilities. Mink visit them to burrow for frogs, and one of two  traps sunk in the mud and shallow water are pretty sure of an  occasional catch. And they are but little trouble to tend as the warm  spring water prevents freezing.    Now a word about bait. In my opinion the very best bait is fish;  trout, pickerel, shiner or any other fresh fish, being all about  equally good. But salt fish should never be used for mink, though  after being smoked it makes a taking bait for coon. Red squirrel I  consider next to fish. They are plentiful everywhere, and the mink  makes many a meal off of them in the absence of his favorite food.  The oft-quoted chicken's head has invariably failed for me, nor have  I found the flesh of the muskrat such a killer as is claimed by some.  Partridge heads, wood mice and frogs are all good. In the absence of  anything else I have sometimes used English sparrows with fair  results.    Don't be too generous with your baits. A section of small fish an  inch long is sufficient and much less likely to arouse suspicions  than a larger piece. In carrying bait in your bag, wrap in an old rag  so it will not come in contact with the metal of hatchet or traps,  and wash clean before using. Locate your traps on long, comparatively  straight reaches of the stream, as mink often make short cuts when  traveling and might miss your set entirely if placed on a bend. Above  all, study your game and don't get too knowing to take a pointer.        CHAPTER XVIII.    PROPER SIZE TRAPS.    For mink I have found a No. 0 trap, if carefully set with proper  precaution, is as good and lucky as a No. 1 or 1 1/2 trap as some  trappers advocate, writes a Canadian trapper. I used a bunch on a  considerable sized lake one fall. The lake had numerous small creeks  and rivers falling into it. At the junction of these with the lake I  set my traps. They were all No. 0, selected on account of their  lightness, as there was a long carry to get to the lake from a  traveled route and added to the canoe, my gun, blanket and  provisions, the traps were somewhat of a consideration, and I  therefore took the ones of less weight.    I made two visits to the lake before it froze and got 20 mink, 1  marten and a female fisher.    Where I made a water set I saw that the water outside went down  pretty bold, and I always tied a stone to the trap and thus insured  the animal drowning.    Where I set on land I without fail attached the chain to a tossing  pole, thereby preventing the fur being damaged by mice or the animal  being eaten by some other.    Some may question the possibility of such small traps being for any  length of time in order as a water set, but I must explain. The lake  was of considerable size and the season the latter part of October.  Such a lake at that season of the year is not subject to any great  fluctuations in the height of the water.    I may say in conclusion about this particular sized trap, that on  that trapping tour I only lost one mink. I found the trap sprung with  a single toe in the jaws.    The trap had been a dry set one, and by reading the signs I found  some snow had melted and dripped from an over-hanging branch on to  the junction of the jaws. This had frozen (the trap being in the  shade) and prevented its usual activity. As a consequence it only  caught on as the mink was in the act of lifting his foot, so I was  satisfied it was circumstance and not the fault of the trap that  caused the missing of this mink.    The No. 1 Blake & Lamb and the Oneida Jump are the ideal mink traps  for me, says an Ohio trapper. When it comes to the snow set the old  Blake & Lamb is second to none. The only fault I find with this trap  is that the chain is not long enough, and this is the fault with  other makes of traps as well.    When I trap mink I use muskrat carcass for water sets. The favorite  food of the mink is crawfish, frogs and fish. Of course this kind of  bait can't well be found in the trapping season. When I find a sly  old mink I leave off both scent and bait, conceal my traps well under  the bank or places where it likely travels, and just leave the trap  there. If I don't catch it in a week I only go close enough to see  whether there is anything in the trap or not.    About mink, I think they are queer little animals. Sometimes they are  wise and sometimes they are not. I think the reason some of them are  wise is because they get educated on trap lore by getting their toes  pinched in some poor trap or trap that is carelessly set. I use No. 1  Newhouse for mink and lost only one mink out of my traps last season,  and I got one of his toes. I cover my traps so there isn't a bit of  chain or trap in sight, and use clean traps free from rust. I use  muskrat musk and mink musk with good success, but common sense is the  best.    I trapped over the same ground all winter and caught four mink in one  place and three in another. I see that some trappers think that the  scent of the mink will scare them away, but that is the best scent I  could find when trapping mink on rat houses. A large rat will make a  hard fight for a small mink if he has a fair show, and when a mink  gets into a fight he will throw out scent like a skunk. For that  reason I think scent is all right to attract mink to traps.    Now if you set a trap and use this scent with a little muskrat musk,  when a mink comes along he smells the musk of both mink and rat, and  begins to look around or rather smell around for the remains of the  rat to make a meal on. If you have the trap and scent in the right  place you will have another mink on your list.    Of course there are a few old fellows that are educated that are  pretty shy of anything that isn't natural to them. These fellows you  can catch in blind sets somewhere along your line. About the best  place I can find to catch mink is where they drill into a rat house  to catch rats. They smell around till they find a soft place on the  south side of the house and dig a hole just large enough to crawl  through, right into the rat's nest.        CHAPTER XIX.    DEADFALLS.    First a little pen about a foot square is built of stones and chunks  or by driving stakes close together, leaving one side open. The pen  should be built smaller and tighter than shown in illustration, so  that a small mink or weasel cannot get in from the back or sides. The  pen in illustration is purposely large so that triggers and bait can  be seen, giving the inexperienced deadfall trapper a better idea of  how to set.    The stakes should be cut about thirty inches long and driven into the  ground some sixteen inches, leaving fourteen, or thereabout above the  ground. Of course if the earth is very solid stakes need not be so  long, but should be so driven that only about fourteen inches remains  above ground. A sapling say four inches in diameter and four feet  long is laid across the end that is open. A sapling that is four or  five inches in diameter and about twelve feet long is now cut for the  \"fall.\"    Stakes are set so that this pole or fall will play over the short  pole on the ground. These stakes should be driven in pairs; two about  eighteen inches from the end; two about fourteen further back. (See  illustration). The small end of the pole should be split and a stake  driven firmly through it so there will be no danger of the pole  turning and \"going off\" of its own accord.    The trap is set by placing the prop (which is only seven inches in  length and half an inch through) between the top log and the short  one on the ground, to which is attached the long trigger, which is  only a stick about the size of the prop, but about twice as long, the  baited end of which extends back into the little pen. The figure 4  triggers can be used if preferred, but the two piece is as good if  not better. The bait may consist of a piece of fish, chicken, rabbit  or any tough bit of meat so long as it is fresh, and the bloodier the  better.    An animal on scenting the bait will reach into the trap--the top of  the pen having been carefully covered over--between the logs. When  the animal seizes the bait the long trigger is pulled off of the  upright prop and down comes the fall, killing the animal by its  weight. Skunk, coon, opossum, mink, and in fact nearly all kinds of  animals are easily caught in this trap. The fox is an exception, as  it is rather hard to catch them in deadfalls.      [Illustration: THE POLE DEADFALL.]    The more care you take to build the pen tight and strong the less  liable is some animal to tear it down and get the bait from the  outside; also if you will cover the pen with leaves, grass, sticks,  etc., animals will not be so shy of the trap. The triggers are very  simple, the long one being placed on top of the upright, or short  one. The long trigger should have a short prong left or a nail driven  in it to prevent the game from getting the bait off too easy. If you  find it hard to get saplings the right size for a fall, and are too  light, they can be weighted with a pole laid on the \"fall.\"    The most successful trapper uses some deadfalls as well as steel  traps, especially if trapping for a season at one place. If trapping  season after season in the same locality deadfalls are a great help  for mink that are apparently hard to catch in steel traps readily  take bait from deadfalls and get caught. On the other hand, mink that  refuse to take bait from deadfalls are often caught in blind steel  trap sets.    The experienced trapper knows that mink travel along creeks, rivers,  swamps, ponds and lakes. Care should "]]]
