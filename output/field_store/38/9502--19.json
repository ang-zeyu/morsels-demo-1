It is not       clear what point is referred to under _Geranium pyrenaicum_.         {170} The author's work on duck's wings &c. is in _Var. under       Dom._, Ed. 2, i. p. 299.         {171} The words _vis medicatrix_ are inserted after \"useless,\"       apparently as a memorandum.    Our theory, I may remark would permit an organ <to> become abortive with  respect to its primary use, to be turned to any other purpose, (as the  buds in a cauliflower) thus we can see no difficulty in bones of male  marsupials being used as fulcrum of muscles, or style of  marygold{172},--indeed in one point of view, the heads of [vertebrated]  animal may be said to be abortive vertebrae turned into other use: legs  of some crustacea abortive jaws, &c., &c. De Candolle's analogy of table  covered with dishes{173}.         {172} In the male florets of certain Compositae the style functions       merely as a piston for forcing out the pollen.         {173} <On the back of the page is the following.> If abortive organs       are a trace preserved by hereditary tendency, of organ in ancestor       of use, we can at once see why important in natural classification,       also why more plain in young animal because, as in last section, the       selection has altered the old animal most. I repeat, these wondrous       facts, of parts created for no use in past and present time, all       can by my theory receive simple explanation; or they receive none       and we must be content with some such empty metaphor, as that of De       Candolle, who compares creation to a well covered table, and says       abortive organs may be compared to the dishes (some should be empty)       placed symmetrically!    <The following passage was possibly intended to be inserted here.>  Degradation and complication see Lamarck: no tendency to perfection: if  room, [even] high organism would have greater power in beating lower  one, thought <?> to be selected for a degraded end.      Sec. X. RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.    Let us recapitulate the whole <?> <of> these latter sections by taking  case of the three species of Rhinoceros, which inhabit Java, Sumatra,  and mainland of Malacca or India. We find these three close neighbours,  occupants of distinct but neighbouring districts, as a group having a  different aspect from the Rhinoceros of Africa, though some of these  latter inhabit very similar countries, but others most diverse stations.  We find them intimately related [scarcely <?> differences more than some  breeds of cattle] in structure to the Rhinoceros, which for immense  periods have inhabited this one, out of three main zoological divisions  of the world. Yet some of these ancient animals were fitted to very  different stations: we find all three <illegible> of the generic character  of the Rhinoceros, which form a [piece of net]{174} set of links in the  broken chain representing the Pachydermata, as the chain likewise forms  a portion in other and longer chains. We see this wonderfully in  dissecting the coarse leg of all three and finding nearly the same bones  as in bat's wings or man's hand, but we see the clear mark in solid  tibia of the fusion into it of the fibula. In all three we find their  heads composed of three altered vertebrae, short neck, same bones as  giraffe. In the upper jaws of all three we find small teeth like  rabbit's. In dissecting them in foetal state we find at a not very early  stage their form exactly alike the most different animals, and even with  arteries running as in a fish: and this similarity holds when the young  one is produced in womb, pond, egg or spawn. Now these three undoubted  species scarcely differ more than breeds of cattle, are probably  subject to many the same contagious diseases; if domesticated these  forms would vary, and they might possibly breed together, and fuse into  something{175} different <from> their aboriginal forms; might be selected  to serve different ends.         {174} The author doubtless meant that the complex relationships       between organisms can be roughly represented by a net in which the       knots stand for species.         {175} Between the lines occurs:--\"one <?> form be lost.\"    Now the Creationist believes these three Rhinoceroses were created{176}  with their deceptive appearance of true, not <illegible> relationship;  as well can I believe the planets revolve in their present courses not  from one law of gravity but from distinct volition of Creator.         {176} The original sentence is here broken up by the insertion       of:--\"out of the dust of Java, Sumatra, these <?> allied to past       and present age and <illegible>, with the stamp of inutility in       some of their organs and conversion in others.\"    If real species, sterile one with another, differently adapted, now  inhabiting different countries, with different structures and instincts,  are admitted to have common descent, we can only legitimately stop where  our facts stop. Look how far in some case a chain of species will lead  us. <This probably refers to the Crustacea, where the two ends of the  series have \"hardly a character in common.\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 419.>  May we not jump (considering how much extermination, and how imperfect  geological records) from one sub-genus to another sub-genus. Can genera  restrain us; many of the same arguments, which made us give up species,  inexorably demand genera and families and orders to fall, and classes  tottering. We ought to stop only when clear unity of type, independent  of use and adaptation, ceases.    Be it remembered no naturalist pretends to give test from external  characters of species; in many genera the distinction is quite  arbitrary{177}. But there remains one other way of comparing species  with races; it is to compare the effects of crossing them. Would it not  be wonderful, if the union of two organisms, produced by two separate  acts of Creation, blended their characters together when crossed  according to the same rules, as two races which have undoubtedly  descended from same parent stock; yet this can be shown to be the case.  For sterility, though a usual <?>, is not an invariable concomitant, it  varies much in degree and has been shown to be probably dependent on  causes closely analogous with those which make domesticated organisms  sterile. Independent of sterility there is no difference between  mongrels and hybrids, as can be shown in a long series of facts. It is  strikingly seen in cases of instincts, when the minds of the two species  or races become blended together{178}. In both cases if the half-breed  be crossed with either parent for a few generations, all traces of the  one parent form is lost (as Koelreuter in two tobacco species almost  sterile together), so that the Creationist in the case of a species,  must believe that one act of creation is absorbed into another!         {177} Between the lines occur the words:--\"Species vary according       to same general laws as varieties; they cross according to same       laws.\"         {178} \"A cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations       the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds,\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 214,       vi. p. 327.    {Illustration: Facsimile of the original manuscript of the paragraph on  p. 50.}      CONCLUSION.    Such are my reasons for believing that specific forms are not immutable.  The affinity of different groups, the unity of types of structure, the  representative forms through which foetus passes, the metamorphosis of  organs, the abortion of others cease to be metaphorical expressions and  become intelligible facts. We no longer look <an> on animal as a savage does  at a ship{179}, or other great work of art, as a thing wholly beyond  comprehension, but we feel far more interest in examining it. How  interesting is every instinct, when we speculate on their origin as an  hereditary or congenital habit or produced by the selection of  individuals differing slightly from their parents. We must look at every  complicated mechanism and instinct, as the summary of a long history,  <as the summing up> of{180} useful contrivances, much like a work of art.  How interesting does the distribution of all animals become, as throwing  light on ancient geography. [We see some seas bridged over.] Geology  loses in its glory from the imperfection of its archives{181}, but how  does it gain in the immensity of the periods of its formations and of  the gaps separating these formations. There is much grandeur in looking  at the existing animals either as the lineal descendants of the forms  buried under thousand feet of matter, or as the coheirs of some still  more ancient ancestor. It accords with what we know of the law impressed  on matter by the Creator, that the creation and extinction of forms,  like the birth and death of individuals should be the effect of  secondary [laws] means{182}. It is derogatory that the Creator of  countless systems of worlds should have created each of the myriads of  creeping parasites and [slimy] worms which have swarmed each day of life  on land and water <on> [this] one globe. We cease being astonished, however  much we may deplore, that a group of animals should have been directly  created to lay their eggs in bowels and flesh of other,--that some  organisms should delight in cruelty,--that animals should be led away by  false instincts,--that annually there should be an incalculable waste  of eggs and pollen. From death, famine, rapine, and the concealed war of  nature we can see that the highest good, which we can conceive, the  creation of the higher animals has directly come. Doubtless it at first  transcends our humble powers, to conceive laws capable of creating  individual organisms, each characterised by the most exquisite  workmanship and widely-extended adaptations. It accords better with [our  modesty] the lowness of our faculties to suppose each must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#16)"],[1," the lake and  we had to row.  I'm sick of motor boating.\"    \"Suppose I fix it for you?\" went on Tom.    \"If you do, I'll pay you well.\"    \"I wouldn't do it for pay--not the kind you mean,\" continued the young  inventor.    \"What do you mean then?\" and Andy's face, that had lighted up, became  glum again.    \"Well, if I fix your boat for you, will you let me run it a little  while?\"    \"You mean show me how to run it?\"    \"No, I mean take it myself.  Look here, Andy, my boat's been stolen,  and I thought you took it to get even with me.  You say you didn't--\"    \"And I didn't touch it,\" interposed the squint-eyed lad quickly.    \"All right, I believe you.  But somebody stole it, and I think I know  who.\"    \"Who?\" asked Sam Snedecker.    \"Well, you wouldn't know if I told you, but I suspect some men with  whom I had trouble before,\" and Tom referred to Happy Harry and his  gang.  \"I think they have my boat on this lake, and I'd like to get  another speedy craft to cruise about it and make a further search.  How  about it, Andy?  If I fix your boat, will you let me take it to look  for my boat?\"    \"Sure thing!\" agreed the bully quickly, and his voice for once was  friendly toward Tom.  \"Fix the engine so it will run, and you can use  the RED STREAK as long as you like.\"    \"Oh, I probably wouldn't want it very long.  I could cover the lake in  about three days, and I hope by that time I could locate the thieves.  Is it a bargain?\"    \"Sure,\" agreed Andy again, and Tom got into the motor-boat to look at  the engine.  He found that it would require some time to adjust it  properly and that it would be necessary to take the motor apart.    \"I think I'd better tow you to my dock,\" the young inventor said to  Andy.  \"I can use some tools from the shop then, and by to-night I'll  have the RED STREAK in running order.\"    The breeze was in the right quarter, fortunately, and with the  motor-boat dragging behind, the ARROW's owner put the nose of the  sailing craft toward his home dock.    When Tom reached his house he found that Mrs. Baggert had received  another telephone message from Mr. Swift, inquiring why his son had not  returned to Sandport.    \"He says if you don't come back by to-morrow,\" repeated the  housekeeper, \"that he'll come home by train.  He's getting anxious, I  believe.\"    \"Shouldn't wonder,\" admitted Tom.  \"But I want him to stay there.  The  change will do him good.  I'll soon have my boat back, now that I can  go about the lake swiftly, and then I'll join him.  I'll tell him to be  patient.\"    Tom talked with his father at some length, assuring him that everything  was well at the Shopton house and promising to soon be with him.  Then  the young inventor began work on the motor of the RED STREAK.  He found  it quite a job and had to call on Mr. Jackson to help him, for one of  the pistons had to be repaired and a number of adjustments made to the  cylinders.    But that night the motor was fully mended and placed back in the boat.  It was in better shape than it had been since Andy had purchased the  craft.    \"There,\" remarked Tom, \"now I'm ready to hunt for those scoundrels.  Will you leave your boat at my dock to-night, Andy?\"    \"Yes, so you can start out early in the morning.  I'm not going.\"    \"Why not?\" demanded Tom quickly.    \"Well--er--you see I've had enough of motoring for a while,\" explained  Andy.  \"Besides, I don't believe my mother would like me to go out on a  chase after thieves.  If we had to shoot I might hit one of them, and--\"    \"Oh, I see,\" answered Tom.  \"But I don't like to take your boat alone.  Besides, I don't fancy there will be much shooting.  I know I'm not  going to take a gun.  In fact, the one Mr. Duncan gave me is in the  boat.  All I want is to get the ARROW back.\"    \"That's all right,\" went on Andy.  \"You take my boat and use it as long  as you like.  I'll rest up a few days.  When you find your boat you can  bring mine back.\"    Tom understood.  He was just as glad not to have Andy accompany him in  the chase, as he and the red-haired lad had never been good friends and  probably never would be.  So it would cause some embarrassment to be  together in a boat all day.  Then again Tom knew he could manage the  RED STREAK better alone, but, of course, he did not want to mention  this when he asked for the loan of the craft.  Andy's own suggestion,  however, had solved the difficulty.  Tom had an idea that Andy felt a  little timid about going in pursuit of the thieves, but naturally it  would not do to mention this, for the squint-eyed lad considered  himself quite a fighter.    Early the next morning, alone in the RED STREAK, Tom continued the  search for his stolen boat.  He started out from his home dock and  mapped out a course that would take him well around the lake.    \"I s'pose I could take a run to Sandport now,\" mused the youth as he  shot in and out of the little bays, keeping watch for the ARROW.  \"But  if I do dad will have to be told all about it, and, he'll worry.  Then,  too, he might want to accompany me, and I think I can manage this  better alone, for the RED STREAK will run faster with only one in.  I  ought to wind up this search in two days, if my boat is still on the  lake.  And if those scoundrels have sunk her I'll make them pay for it.\"    On shot the speedy motor-boat, in and out along the winding shoreline,  with the lad in the bow at the steering-wheel peering with eager eyes  into every nook and corner where his craft might be hidden.          CHAPTER XVII    \"THERE SHE IS!\"      Anticipating that he would be some time on his search, the young  inventor had gone prepared for it.  He had a supply of provisions and  he had told Mrs. Baggert he might not be back that night.  But he did  not intend to sleep aboard the RED STREAK, which, being a racing boat,  was not large enough to afford much room for passengers.  Tom had  planned, therefore, to put up at some hotel near the lake in case his  hunt should last beyond one night.    That it would do this was almost certain, for all that morning he  searched unavailingly for the ARROW.  A distant mill whistle sounding  over Lake Carlopa told him it was noon.    \"Dinner time,\" he announced to himself.  \"Guess I'll run up along shore  in the shade and eat.\"    Selecting a place where the trees overhung the water, forming a quiet,  cool nook, Tom sent the boat in there, and, tying it to a leaning tree,  he began his simple meal.  Various thoughts filled his mind, but chief  among them was the desire to overtake the thieves who had his boat.  That it was Happy Harry's gang he was positive.    The lad nearly finished eating and was considering what direction he  might best search in next when he heard, running along a road that  bordered the lake, an automobile.    \"Wonder who that is?\" mused Tom.  \"It won't do any harm to take a look,  for it might be some of those thieves again.  They probably still have  their auto or Happy Harry couldn't have gotten from Sandport to Shopton  so quickly.\"    The young inventor slipped ashore from the motor-boat, taking care to  make no noise.  Stealing silently along toward the road, he peered  through the underbrush for a sight of the machine, which seemed to be  going slowly.  But before the youth had a glimpse of it he was made  aware who the occupant was by hearing someone exclaim:    \"Bless my shoe laces if this cantankerous contraption isn't going wrong  again!  I wonder if it's going to have a fit here in this lonely place.  It acts just as if it was.  Bless my very existence! Hold on now.  Be  nice!  Be nice!\"    \"Mr. Damon!\" exclaimed Tom, and, without knowing it, he had spoken  aloud.    \"Hold on there!  Hold on!  Who's calling me in this forsaken locality?  Bless my shirt studs!  But who is it?\" and the eccentric man who had  sold Tom the motor-cycle looked intently at the bushes.    \"Here I am, Mr. Damon,\" answered the lad, stepping out into the road.  \"I knew it was you as soon as I saw you.\"    \"Bless my liver, but that's very true!  I suppose you heard my  unfortunate automobile puffing along.  I declare I don't know what ails  it.  I got it on the advice of my physician, who said I must get out in  the air, but, bless my gears, it's the auto who needs a doctor more  than I do!  It's continually out of order.  Something is going to  happen right away.  I can tell by the way it's behaving.\"    Mr. Damon had thrown out the clutch, but the engine was still running,  though in a jerky, uncertain fashion, which indicated to the trained  ear of the young inventor that something was wrong.    \"Perhaps I can fix it for you as I did before,\" ventured Tom.    \"Bless my eyebrows!  Perhaps you can,\" cried the eccentric man  hopefully.  \"You always seem to turn up at the right moment.  How do  you manage it?\"    \"I don't know.  I remember the time you turned up just when I wanted  you to help me capture Happy Harry and his gang, and now, by, a strange  coincidence, I'm after them again.\"    \"You don't say so!  My good gracious!  Bless my hatband!  But that's  odd.  There!\" he ejaculated suddenly as the automobile engine stopped  with a choking sigh, \"I knew something was going to happen.\"    \"Let me take a look,\" proposed the lad, and he was soon busy peering  into the interior of the machine.  At first he could not find the  trouble, but being a persistent youth, Tom went at it systematically  and located it in two places.  The clutch was not rightly adjusted and  the carburetor float feed needed fixing.  The young inventor was not  long in making the slight repairs and then he assured Mr. Damon that  his automobile would run properly.    \"Bless my very existence, but what a thing it is to have a head for  mechanics!\" exclaimed the odd man gratefully.  \"Now it would bother me  to adjust a nutmeg grater if it got out of order, but I dare say you  could fix it in no time.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom, \"I could and so could you, for there's nothing"]]]
