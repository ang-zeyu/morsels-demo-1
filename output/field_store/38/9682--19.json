Sec. XV. And what effect has this splendor on those who pass beneath it?  You may walk from sunrise to sunset, to and fro, before the gateway of  St. Mark's, and you will not see an eye lifted to it, nor a countenance  brightened by it. Priest and layman, soldier and civilian, rich and  poor, pass by it alike regardlessly. Up to the very recesses of the  porches, the meanest tradesmen of the city push their counters; nay, the  foundations of its pillars are themselves the seats--not \"of them that  sell doves\" for sacrifice, but of the vendors of toys and caricatures.  Round the whole square in front of the church there is almost a  continuous line of cafes, where the idle Venetians of the middle classes  lounge, and read empty journals; in its centre the Austrian bands play  during the time of vespers, their martial music jarring with the organ  notes,--the march drowning the miserere, and the sullen crowd  thickening round them,--a crowd, which, if it had its will, would  stiletto every soldier that pipes to it. And in the recesses of the  porches, all day long, knots of men of the lowest classes, unemployed  and listless, lie basking in the sun like lizards; and unregarded  children,--every heavy glance of their young eyes full of desperation  and stony depravity, and their throats hoarse with cursing,--gamble,  and fight, and snarl, and sleep, hour after hour, clashing their bruised  centesimi upon the marble ledges of the church porch. And the images of  Christ and His angels look down upon it continually.    That we may not enter the church out of the midst of the horror of this,  let us turn aside under the portico which looks towards the sea, and  passing round within the two massive pillars brought from St. Jean  d'Acre, we shall find the gate of the Baptistery; let us enter there.  The heavy door closes behind us instantly, and the light, and the  turbulence of the Piazzetta, are together shut out by it.    Sec. XVI. We are in a low vaulted room; vaulted, not with arches, but  with small cupolas starred with gold, and chequered with gloomy figures:  in the centre is a bronze font charged with rich bas-reliefs, a small  figure of the Baptist standing above it in a single ray of light that  glances across the narrow room, dying as it falls from a window high in  the wall, and the first thing that it strikes, and the only thing that  it strikes brightly, is a tomb. We hardly know if it be a tomb indeed;  for it is like a narrow couch set beside the window, low-roofed and  curtained, so that it might seem, but that it has some height above the  pavement, to have been drawn towards the window, that the sleeper might  be wakened early;--only there are two angels who have drawn the curtain  back, and are looking down upon him. Let us look also, and thank that  gentle light that rests upon his forehead for ever, and dies away upon  his breast.    The face is of a man in middle life, but there are two deep furrows  right across the forehead, dividing it like the foundations of a tower:  the height of it above is bound by the fillet of the ducal cap. The  rest of the features are singularly small and delicate, the lips sharp,  perhaps the sharpness of death being added to that of the natural lines;  but there is a sweet smile upon them, and a deep serenity upon the whole  countenance. The roof of the canopy above has been blue, filled with  stars; beneath, in the centre of the tomb on which the figure rests, is  a seated figure of the Virgin, and the border of it all around is of  flowers and soft leaves, growing rich and deep, as if in a field in  summer.    It is the Doge Andrea Dandolo, a man early great among the great of  Venice; and early lost. She chose him for her king in his 36th year; he  died ten years later, leaving behind him that history to which we owe  half of what we know of her former fortunes.    Sec. XVII. Look round at the room in which he lies. The floor of it is of  rich mosaic, encompassed by a low seat of red marble, and its walls are  of alabaster, but worn and shattered, and darkly stained with age,  almost a ruin,--in places the slabs of marble have fallen away  altogether, and the rugged brickwork is seen through the rents, but all  beautiful; the ravaging fissures fretting their way among the islands  and channelled zones of the alabaster, and the time-stains on its  translucent masses darkened into fields of rich golden brown, like the  color of seaweed when the sun strikes on it through deep sea. The light  fades away into the recess of the chamber towards the altar, and the eye  can hardly trace the lines of the bas-relief behind it of the baptism of  Christ: but on the vaulting of the roof the figures are distinct, and  there are seen upon it two great circles, one surrounded by the  \"Principalities and powers in heavenly places,\" of which Milton has  expressed the ancient division in the single massy line,      \"Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\"    and around the other, the Apostles; Christ the centre of both; and upon  the walls, again and again repeated, the gaunt figure of the Baptist, in  every circumstance of his life and death; and the streams of the Jordan  running down between their cloven rocks; the axe laid to the root of a  fruitless tree that springs upon their shore. \"Every tree that bringeth  not forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire.\" Yes,  verily: to be baptized with fire, or to be cast therein; it is the  choice set before all men. The march-notes still murmur through the  grated window, and mingle with the sounding in our ears of the sentence  of judgment, which the old Greek has written on that Baptistery wall.  Venice has made her choice.    Sec. XVIII. He who lies under that stony canopy would have taught her  another choice, in his day, if she would have listened to him; but he  and his counsels have long been forgotten by her, and the dust lies upon  his lips.    Through the heavy door whose bronze network closes the place of his  rest, let us enter the church itself. It is lost in still deeper  twilight, to which the eye must be accustomed for some moments before  the form of the building can be traced; and then there opens before us a  vast cave, hewn out into the form of a Cross, and divided into shadowy  aisles by many pillars. Round the domes of its roof the light enters  only through narrow apertures like large stars; and here and there a ray  or two from some far away casement wanders into the darkness, and casts  a narrow phosphoric stream upon the waves of marble that heave and fall  in a thousand colors along the floor. What else there is of light is  from torches, or silver lamps, burning ceaselessly in the recesses of  the chapels; the roof sheeted with gold, and the polished walls covered  with alabaster, give back at every curve and angle some feeble gleaming  to the flames; and the glories round the heads of the sculptured saints  flash out upon us as we pass them, and sink again into the gloom. Under  foot and over head, a continual succession of crowded imagery, one  picture passing into another, as in a dream; forms beautiful and  terrible mixed together; dragons and serpents, and ravening beasts of  prey, and graceful birds that in the midst of them drink from running  fountains and feed from vases of crystal; the passions and the pleasures  of human life symbolized together, and the mystery of its redemption;  for the mazes of interwoven lines and changeful pictures lead always at  last to the Cross, lifted and carved in every place and upon every  stone; sometimes with the serpent of eternity wrapt round it, sometimes  with doves beneath its arms, and sweet herbage growing forth from its  feet; but conspicuous most of all on the great rood that crosses the  church before the altar, raised in bright blazonry against the shadow of  the apse. And although in the recesses of the aisles and chapels, when  the mist of the incense hangs heavily, we may see continually a figure  traced in faint lines upon their marble, a woman standing with her eyes  raised to heaven, and the inscription above her, \"Mother of God,\" she is  not here the presiding deity. It is the Cross that is first seen, and  always, burning in the centre of the temple; and every dome and hollow  of its roof has the figure of Christ in the utmost height of it, raised  in power, or returning in judgment.    Sec. XIX. Nor is this interior without effect on the minds of the people.  At every hour of the day there are groups collected before the various  shrines, and solitary worshippers scattered through the darker places of  the church, evidently in prayer both deep and reverent, and, for the  most part, profoundly sorrowful. The devotees at the greater number of  the renowned shrines of Romanism may be seen murmuring their appointed  prayers with wandering eyes and unengaged gestures; but the step of the  stranger does not disturb those who kneel on the pavement of St. Mark's;  and hardly a moment passes, from early morning to sunset, in which we  may not see some half-veiled figure enter beneath the Arabian porch,  cast itself into long abasement on the floor of the temple, and then  rising slowly with more confirmed step, and with a passionate kiss and  clasp of the arms given to the feet of the crucifix, by which the lamps  burn always in the northern aisle, leave the church, as if comforted.    Sec. XX. But we must not hastily conclude from this that the nobler  characters of the building have at present any influence in fostering a  devotional spirit. There is distress enough in Venice to bring many to  their knees, without excitement from external imagery; and whatever  there may be in the temper of the worship offered in St. Mark's more  than can be accounted for by reference to the unhappy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#16)"],[1,"legend with the name of the dead, and an \"Orate  pro anima\" in another circle in the centre. And in this we may note one  great proof of superiority in Italian over English tombs; the latter  being often enriched with quatrefoils, small shafts, and arches, and  other ordinary architectural decorations, which destroy their  seriousness and solemnity, render them little more than ornamental, and  have no religious meaning whatever; while the Italian sarcophagi are  kept massive, smooth, and gloomy,--heavy-lidded dungeons of stone, like  rock-tombs,--but bearing on their surface, sculptured with tender and  narrow lines, the emblem of the cross, not presumptuously nor proudly,  but dimly graven upon their granite, like the hope which the human heart  holds, but hardly perceives in its heaviness.    Sec. L. Among the tombs in front of the Church of St. John and Paul  there is one which is peculiarly illustrative of the simplicity of these  earlier ages. It is on the left of the entrance, a massy sarcophagus  with low horns as of an altar, placed in a rude recess of the outside  wall, shattered and worn, and here and there entangled among wild grass  and weeds. Yet it is the tomb of two Doges, Jacopo and Lorenzo Tiepolo,  by one of whom nearly the whole ground was given for the erection of the  noble church in front of which his unprotected tomb is wasting away. The  sarcophagus bears an inscription in the centre, describing the acts of  the Doges, of which the letters show that it was added a considerable  period after the erection of the tomb: the original legend is still left  in other letters on its base, to this effect,      \"Lord James, died 1251. Lord Laurence, died 1288.\"    At the two corners of the sarcophagus are two angels bearing censers;  and on its lid two birds, with crosses like crests upon their heads. For  the sake of the traveller in Venice the reader will, I think, pardon me  the momentary irrelevancy of telling the meaning of these symbols.    Sec. LI. The foundation of the church of St. John and Paul was laid by the  Dominicans about 1234, under the immediate protection of the Senate and  the Doge Giacomo Tiepolo, accorded to them in consequence of a  miraculous vision appearing to the Doge; of which the following account  is given in popular tradition:    \"In the year 1226, the Doge Giacomo Tiepolo dreamed a dream; and in his  dream he saw the little oratory of the Dominicans, and, behold, the  ground all around it (now occupied by the church) was covered with  roses of the color of vermilion, and the air was filled with their  fragrance. And in the midst of the roses, there were seen flying to and  fro a crowd of white doves, with golden crosses upon their heads. And  while the Doge looked, and wondered, behold, two angels descended from  heaven with golden censers, and passing through the oratory, and forth  among the flowers, they filled the place with the smoke of their  incense. Then the Doge heard suddenly a clear and loud voice which  proclaimed, 'This is the place that I have chosen for my preachers;' and  having heard it, straightway he awoke and went to the Senate, and  declared to them the vision. Then the Senate decreed that forty paces of  ground should be given to enlarge the monastery; and the Doge Tiepolo  himself made a still larger grant afterwards.\"    There is nothing miraculous in the occurrence of such a dream as this to  the devout Doge; and the fact, of which there is no doubt, that the  greater part of the land on which the church stands was given by him, is  partly a confirmation of the story. But, whether the sculptures on the  tomb were records of the vision, or the vision a monkish invention from  the sculptures on the tomb, the reader will not, I believe, look upon  its doves and crosses, or rudely carved angels, any more with disdain;  knowing how, in one way or another, they were connected with a point of  deep religious belief.    Sec. LII. Towards the beginning of the fourteenth century, in Venice, the  recumbent figure begins to appear on the sarcophagus, the first dated  example being also one of the most beautiful; the statue of the prophet  Simeon, sculptured upon the tomb which was to receive his relics in the  church dedicated to him under the name of San Simeone Grande. So soon as  the figure appears, the sarcophagus becomes much more richly sculptured,  but always with definite religious purpose. It is usually divided into  two panels, which are filled with small bas-reliefs of the acts or  martyrdom of the patron saints of the deceased: between them, in the  centre, Christ, or the Virgin and Child, are richly enthroned, under a  curtained canopy; and the two figures representing the Annunciation are  almost always at the angles; the promise of the Birth of Christ being  taken as at once the ground and the type of the promise of eternal life  to all men.    Sec. LIII. These figures are always in Venice most rudely chiselled; the  progress of figure sculpture being there comparatively tardy. At Verona,  where the great Pisan school had strong influence, the monumental  sculpture is immeasurably finer; and, so early as about the year  1335,[16] the consummate form of the Gothic tomb occurs in the monument  of Can Grande della Scala at Verona. It is set over the portal of the  chapel anciently belonging to the family. The sarcophagus is sculptured  with shallow bas-reliefs, representing (which is rare in the tombs with  which I am acquainted in Italy, unless they are those of saints) the  principal achievements of the warrior's life, especially the siege of  Vicenza and battle of Placenza; these sculptures, however, form little  more than a chased and roughened groundwork for the fully relieved  statues representing the Annunciation, projecting boldly from the front  of the sarcophagus. Above, the Lord of Verona is laid in his long robe  of civil dignity, wearing the simple bonnet, consisting merely of a  fillet bound round the brow, knotted and falling on the shoulder. He is  laid as asleep; his arms crossed upon his body, and his sword by his  side. Above him, a bold arched canopy is sustained by two projecting  shafts, and on the pinnacle of its roof is the statue of the knight on  his war-horse; his helmet, dragon-winged and crested with the dog's  head, tossed back behind his shoulders, and the broad and blazoned  drapery floating back from his horse's breast,--so truly drawn by the  old workman from the life, that it seems to wave in the wind, and the  knight's spear to shake, and his marble horse to be evermore quickening  its pace, and starting into heavier and hastier charge, as the silver  clouds float past behind it in the sky.    Sec. LIV. Now observe, in this tomb, as much concession is made to the  pride of man as may ever consist with honor, discretion, or dignity. I  do not enter into any question respecting the character of Can Grande,  though there can be little doubt that he was one of the best among the  nobles of his time; but that is not to our purpose. It is not the  question whether his wars were just, or his greatness honorably  achieved; but whether, supposing them to have been so, these facts are  well and gracefully told upon his tomb. And I believe there can be no  hesitation in the admission of its perfect feeling and truth. Though  beautiful, the tomb is so little conspicuous or intrusive, that it  serves only to decorate the portal of the little chapel, and is hardly  regarded by the traveller as he enters. When it is examined, the history  of the acts of the dead is found subdued into dim and minute ornament  upon his coffin; and the principal aim of the monument is to direct the  thoughts to his image as he lies in death, and to the expression of his  hope of resurrection; while, seen as by the memory far away, diminished  in the brightness of the sky, there is set the likeness of his armed  youth, stately, as it stood of old, in the front of battle, and meet to  be thus recorded for us, that we may now be able to remember the dignity  of the frame, of which those who once looked upon it hardly remembered  that it was dust.    Sec. LV. This, I repeat, is as much as may ever be granted, but this ought  always to be granted, to the honor and the affection of men. The tomb  which stands beside that of Can Grande, nearest it in the little field  of sleep, already shows the traces of erring ambition. It is the tomb of  Mastino the Second, in whose reign began the decline of his family. It  is altogether exquisite as a work of art; and the evidence of a less  wise or noble feeling in its design is found only in this, that the  image of a virtue, Fortitude, as belonging to the dead, is placed on the  extremity of the sarcophagus, opposite to the Crucifixion. But for this  slight circumstance, of which the significance will only be appreciated  as we examine the series of later monuments, the composition of this  monument of Can Mastino would have been as perfect as its decoration is  refined. It consists, like that of Can Grande, of the raised  sarcophagus, bearing the recumbent statue, protected by a noble  foursquare canopy, sculptured with ancient Scripture history. On one  side of the sarcophagus is Christ enthroned, with Can Mastino kneeling  before Him; on the other, Christ is represented in the mystical form,  half-rising from the tomb, meant, I believe, to be at once typical of  His passion and resurrection. The lateral panels are occupied by statues  of saints. At one extremity of the sarcophagus is the Crucifixion; at  the other, a noble statue of Fortitude, with a lion's skin thrown over  her shoulders, its head forming a shield upon her breast, her flowing  hair bound with a narrow fillet, and a three-edged sword in her  gauntleted right hand, drawn back sternly behind her thigh, while, in  her left, she bears high the shield of the Scalas.    Sec. LVI. Close to this monument is another, the stateliest and most "]]]
