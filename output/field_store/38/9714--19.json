It is not as if the water was rough.\"    The fog was so thick that they could scarcely see the ends of the  oar-blades.    \"How are we to find the ship?\" Marion asked.    \"There will be no difficulty about that, Miss Renshaw. They will be sure  to be firing guns as signals for us. There!\" he broke off as the boom of  a cannon came across the water. \"Besides, with the land on our right  hand and this icy breeze from the south, we cannot go far out of our  way.\"    \"Row easy, men,\" the mate commanded. \"We cannot be far from shore now,  and we must begin to look out sharp for rocks. Row light and aisy, and  do not make more noise with your oars than you can help. The natives may  be listening for us; and we do not want a shower of spears in the boat.  Mr. Allen, will you go forward into the bows, and keep a sharp look-out  for rocks?\"    James Allen went forward, and two or three minutes later cried, \"Easy  all! Hold her up!\" Quickly as the order was obeyed the boat's stem  grated on the shore before her way was lost.    \"Back her off, lads!\" the mate cried. As the boat glided off into deep  water again there was a yell from the shore, and a dozen spears struck  the water round her. Fortunately none of them struck her, for she was  invisible to the natives, who had been guided to the spot by the sound  of the oars.    \"Not an encouraging reception,\" Mr. Atherton remarked quietly. \"Well,  ladies, you have not seen the cannibals as yet, but you have heard them.  I think the best plan, Mr. Ryan, will be to tear up one of these rugs  and muffle the oars.\"    \"I think we may as well do so,\" the mate replied \"However, their sharp  ears are sure to hear us if we are close inshore, and we dare not go far  out or we might lose our bearings altogether.\"    \"I do not think we can do that. In the first place, you see, there is  the breeze that brought down the fog to guide us, and in the second the  guns of the ship. We cannot go far wrong with them; and I should say  that when we once get out as far as we believe the headland to lie, the  best thing will be to steer direct for the ship. The danger in that way  would certainly be far less than it is from rocks and savages if we keep  near the shore.\"    \"I think you are right. We will row straight out against the wind for a  quarter of an hour, that will take us clear of the headland, and we will  then shape our course direct for the guns.\"          CHAPTER VI.    PUTTING IN THE REFIT.      The boat rowed steadily in the course that was believed would take them  straight out to sea, the mate listening attentively for the sound of the  distant guns. The reports came up every two or three minutes, their  sound muffled by the fog. \"Sure it's mighty difficult to tell where the  sound comes from, but I think it is well over there on our beam. Do not  you think so?\" the mate asked Mr. Atherton.    \"I think so; yes, I feel sure that we are rowing nearly due south. Even  without the sound of the guns I should feel sure that we cannot at  present be far out of that course. I noticed that as we came along you  hardly had to use any helm, and that the strength on both sides was very  evenly balanced. So that starting out as we did from the shore, we must  be travelling pretty straight. Of course in the long run we should be  sure to sweep round one way or the other and lose our bearings  altogether were it not for the guns. Wilfrid, we will appoint you  time-keeper.\"    \"What am I to keep time of, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"You are to keep time of the guns. I think they are firing about every  three minutes, but you had better time the first two or three. If you  find them three minutes apart, it will be your duty a quarter of a  minute before the gun is due to say in a loud voice 'Stop,' then all  conversation is to cease till we hear the report. Unless we are all  silent and listening, it is very difficult to judge the exact  direction from which the sound comes, and it is important to keep as  straight a line as we can. There is the gun now, begin to count.\"    [Illustration: A DOZEN SPEARS STRUCK THE WATER ROUND HER    _Page 103_]    \"I think we can turn our head in that direction now,\" the mate said. \"It  is just twenty minutes since we left the shore, and we ought to be fully  a mile out beyond the headland.\"    \"I quite agree with you. We have certainly a clear course now to the  ship if we do not make any blunder in keeping it.\"    The mate put the tiller a-starboard.    \"I wonder how long I am to keep it over?\" he said. \"It is a queer  sensation steering without having an idea which way you are going.\"    \"The next gun will tell us whether we have gone too far round or not far  enough,\" Mr. Atherton observed.    \"Well, we will try that,\" the mate said after a short pause. \"I should  think we ought to have made half a turn now.\"    \"Stop!\" Wilfrid exclaimed a minute later. \"Easy rowing, lads, and listen  for the gun.\"    The mate ordered silence in the boat. Half a minute later the report of  the gun was again heard. There was a general exclamation of surprise,  for instead of coming, as they expected, from a point somewhere ahead,  it seemed to them all that the sound was almost astern of them.    \"Now, who would have thought that?\" the mate said. \"I had no idea she  had gone round so far. Well, we must try again, and go to work more  gently this time. Row on, men!\"    The tiller was put slightly a-port, and the boat continued her way. The  talk that had gone on among the passengers was now hushed. Mr. Atherton  had been chatting gaily with the girls from the time the fog came on,  and except at the moment when they went ashore and were attacked by the  natives, no uneasiness had been felt, for the sound of the guns had  seemed to all an assurance that there could be no difficulty in  rejoining the ship. The discovery that for a moment they had been  actually going away from the ship had, for the first time since they  rowed away from the shore, caused a feeling of real uneasiness, and when  Wilfrid again gave notice that the report would soon be heard, all  listened intently, and there was a general exclamation of satisfaction  when the sound was heard nearly ahead.    \"We have got it now,\" the mate said. \"Row on, lads; a long steady stroke  and we shall be in before dinner is cold yet.\"    The conversation now recommenced.    \"Is it any use my stopping here any longer?\" Jim Allen cried from the  bow; \"because if not I will come aft to you. It is a good deal warmer  sitting together than it is out here by myself.\"    \"Yes, you may as well come aft,\" the mate replied. \"As long as we keep  the guns ahead we know that we are clear of rocks. It certainly has come  on bitterly cold.\" There was a general chorus of assent.    \"I should think it would be a good thing, Ryan, to get the sail aft and  unlash it from the gaff and put it over our legs, it will make a lot of  difference in the warmth.\"    \"I think that that is a very good idea,\" the mate assented. \"Lay in your  oar for a minute, Johnson, and get that sail aft.\"    The sail was passed aft, unlashed from the yard, and spread out, adding  considerably to the comfort of all those sitting astern; and now that  the ship's guns were booming ahead, and they had become accustomed to  the thick curtain of cloud hanging round them, the feeling of uneasiness  that the girls had felt was entirely dissipated, and Mr. Atherton had no  longer any occasion to use his best efforts to keep up their spirits.  All laughed and chatted over their adventure, which, as they said, far  exceeded in interest anything they had been promised when they started  from the ship. The only drawback, as they all agreed, was the cold,  which was indeed really severe.    \"We do not seem to come up to the guns as we ought to,\" Mr. Atherton  said to the mate after the boat had been rowing for some time.    \"That is just what I was thinking,\" Mr. Ryan replied. \"I fancy we must  have got a strong current out here against us.\"    \"I expect we have. Ryan, I tell you what. The men have been rowing for  some hours now since they left the ship, I think it would be a good  thing if our youngsters were to relieve some of them for a spell. What  do you say, lads?\"    Wilfrid, the Allens, Hardy, and Wilson all exclaimed that they should be  delighted to take a turn, as it would warm their blood. \"We shall be  able to give them all a spell,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"for there are just  six of us.\"    \"I am certainly not going to let you pull, and you scarcely out of the  doctor's hand,\" the mate said bluntly. \"Why, you must be mad to think of  such a thing! Here, do you take the tiller and I will row the  stroke-oar. Easy all, lads; put on your jackets. Four of you come aft,  and the other two go into the bows.\"    \"I wish we could row,\" Marion said regretfully, as the new crew bent to  their oars. \"I have done a lot of rowing at home, Mr. Atherton, and they  say I row very fairly.\"    \"I am afraid you would not be of much assistance here, young lady,\" Mr.  Atherton said. \"It's one thing to work a light well-balanced oar such as  you use in a gig up the river, but it is a very different one to tug  away at one of these heavy oars in a sea-going boat like this with ten  sitters in her. We shall want all our strength to get back, you may be  sure. There must be a strong current against us, and there is little  chance of our being back, as we hoped, by dinner-time.\"    After the men had had half an hour's rest Mr. Ryan told them to take  their seats and double bank the oars.    \"We shall travel all the faster,\" he said to Mr. Atherton, \"and now that  they have got their wind again it is far better that they should be  rowing than sitting still. The guns are a good deal nearer now. I do not  think that the ship can be more than a mile or a mile and a half away.\"    \"I do not suppose she is,\" Mr. Atherton replied. \"I think I will fire  off my rifle two or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#16)"],[1,"verdure and maturity. The company said that it was an experiment on a  grand scale; but they were much laughed at. I said it was a dangerous  scheme, and nearly lost my position in consequence. I have heard,  though, that it was a great success.\"    During this recital Mr. Ticks' eyes glistened with excitement.    \"Ah!\" he said, \"I am under a thousand obligations to you, young lady. Of  course I could not conceive of such a thing, not knowing the facts. It  is all plain now. The first discharge, enormous and deadly as it was,  was not enough. This network of wires attracted the surplus electricity.  The soil must be of such a quality as to convert this territory into an  enormous secondary battery. The subsoil must have acted as a monstrous  insulator. I shall subject it to a minute analysis. Are we on the verge  of a new electrical discovery? Was this deadly phenomenon a hitherto  unknown property of the electrical fluid? For to walk within the dead  line was like walking into a saturated Leyden jar. Its effect must have  also been to devitalize the oxygen and nitrogen of the atmosphere. The  victim was electrified and suffocated to death at the same instant. At  last I understand the complexity of my astonishing symptoms. The  vibratory storm that we so narrowly escaped was not due to barometric  depression, but came as a responsive consequence of this surcharged  area. When that wire ladder was finally cut off and fell; when it  reached a certain position; when one end touched the negative, the other  the positive pole, then the current became completed and this gigantic  battery was discharged. Had we not been rising at the rate of a hundred  feet a second we should have been fused after the fashion of the  inhabitants of this ghastly territory. The discharge once having taken  place, this country is again free to man and beast.\"    \"Gosh!\" was all that the subdued professor could say.    And now the four travellers lifted up their eyes, and saw before them on  the horizon black moving, indistinct masses, as if brobdignagian locusts  were swarming up the track. Here were the hosts of careworn men,  plunging impatiently toward the lost city for the news that the  unaccountable and malignant power had hitherto denied them. The four  needed courage to meet this unrestrained and desperate mob. Who were  these in the van? What pallid faces, what haggard eyes, what piteous  gestures! Alas, they were the mourners of the dead! Love had wrestled  its way ahead of plunder, and grief had outrun greed. In the front ranks  were women wailing and panting desperately to keep pace with unmanned  men.    This woeful sight aroused Mr. Ticks. He raised his hands towards the  lost city after the manner of an inspired prophet, and there and then  uttered the following impassioned warning to humanity, which Swift took  down in shorthand in the borrowed notebook:    \"Woe unto you that multiply currents you cannot control! Woe unto you  that net your country with the trap of sudden death! Woe unto you that  toss innocent men on broken wires; that surprise your victims in the  counting-house, the home, the street, with destructive bolts! Woe unto  you that undermine and overcast the land with a mysterious foe! Behold!  your dead shall rise in serried phalanx against you, and their mourners  shall rend you to pieces!\"    The only burst of eloquence known to the biography of this prosaic man  subsided into apathetic silence. His hands dropped heavily at his sides.  He turned away from Russell and beheld its blackened site no more.    The throng was now upon them. Multitudes of wild faces asked questions  of the four. Who would answer these? Who could tell the terrible truth?  The professor paled and walked behind Swift. Mr. Ticks shrank at the  awful responsibility, and took refuge behind the professor. Swift halted  and trembled.    \"Go,\" he said to the girl. \"Go! Only a woman can.\"    And she went. She stepped out alone--a few paces, and stood quite still.  Instinctively the masses stopped before her. Eyes, sleepless with  weeping and waiting, riveted themselves upon eyes that were still  haunted with a portentous experience. The girl stretched out one hand in  mute appeal, and then burst into tears and sobbed:    \"Don't! Don't look like that! Oh, you poor people! I am the only one!\"    Awestruck and silently, men and women enveloped her and ministered unto  her. It was the advance guard of the Red Cross Society, led by Clara  Barton, that sheltered this derelict and messenger of woe.    Set upon by a thousand men, Mr. Ticks and the professor told what they  knew. Some cursed and doubted and pressed on. Some bowed their heads and  turned back. But Swift, who had recognized Dubbs driving two powerful  horses and unreeling two telegraph wires, one for the special use of  the Associated Press and the other for the _Planet_, accosted him, and  sent the most famous message known to the American newspaper world since  the close of the civil war.    It was a long message, and we can only give the more important  headlines:         Russell is no more!         Thirty thousand people killed by one unparalleled electric       discharge.         The gigantic spark fuses the whole city into one       indistinguishable molten slag.         Miraculous escape of one lady. The sole survivor.         Thrilling rescue by the _Planet_ reporters in a special       balloon.         The reporters complete the circuit and touch off an       over-charged storage battery with a circumference of one       hundred and fifty miles.         The territory that was impassable now open.         Fifty thousand people race toward the lost city.         Russell perished of her own electricity.         Civilization's new and formidable danger.           *       *       *       *       *    Three months later, on a secular evening, the upholstered pews of an  uptown church were filled with a fashionable audience. As the church  bells tolled eight the organ pealed forth the wedding march. It was  noticed with much comment that the vast audience-room was lighted with  gas, the new electric lights being dispensed with. The bride, Miss  Insula Magnet, had especially desired this.    When the solemn ceremony was ended, and when, amid the craning of necks,  the bride and groom were walking down the white-ribboned aisle, a  diversion happened that arrested the newly wedded couple. But this was  not construed into an ill-omen. A diminutive messenger boy, with a  super-experienced countenance, had met them half way to the vestibule,  and, with a saucy smile, held up an envelope to Mr. Swift's face.    \"It's half an hour late. Wires burned out. Guess you'll read it now!\"    Mr. Statis Ticks, who, although well and worthily married, officiated in  some unprecedented capacity as best man, gave Professor Ariel, one of  the ushers, an intelligent glance. The latter, being the happy possessor  of a new balloon (which he ingenuously called _Reciprocity_), supplied  to him by the always generous _Planet_, and fully elated by his present  position, answered with a broad wink. Mr. Swift, unconscious of the  thousands that were standing in their seats to look at him, and of the  general buzz of interest, tore open the colored envelope with  reportorial haste, and read as follows. It was cabled from his chief,  the proprietor of the _Planet_, now unavoidably detained in England:         \"_Congratulations. Advance of one thousand a year. Report after       two months' bliss. God bless you!_\"          A TERRIBLE EVENING.      Harland Slack sat in the cafe of the Parker House carelessly sipping  whiskey and Apollinaris. He fondly cherished the thought that this  combination was an excellent anti-intoxicant, a brain-quieter; on the  same principle that B & S is supposed to clarify an Englishman's head.  Harland Slack was an attractively repulsive man. He was tall, and  vigorously put together. Evening dress was becoming to him. He never  appeared after six o'clock without it: for it set off his long blond  mustache, his fine artificially curled, blond hair, and his pale regular  features to their best advantage. Seen from the front there were times  when he was considered positively handsome, after the same fashion that  an aristocratic French doll is admired. When he turned his profile, then  there appeared certain hard lines of the check and weak lines of the  forehead and chin that grated on austere physiognomists. The giddy set  of fashionable women, at whose five o'clock teas he still remained the  _eprouvette positive_, thought him adorable: the matrons with  marriageable girls thought him debatable: if he chanced upon a spiritual  woman, she considered him dangerous. The club men privately thought him  unreliable.    It was not so in college before his father died. Then the main features  of his life were promising. If he indulged in occasional gayety he did  not lose all of his self-respect. His classmates noted in him a certain  quality of strength or reserve that was supposed to emanate from himself  rather than from the hard fact that his paternal allowance was only  seven hundred a year, and that he was threatened with disinheritance if  he ran into debt.    But now he had inherited. He had changed. His hands trembled. His eyes  twitched. The corners of his mouth danced the dance of St. Vitus. He had  terrible nightmares, and awoke with parched mouth and with disagreeable  eyes, and with a rebellious head whose disorders required what he called  \"an eye-opener\" to cause them to abate.    His best friends took him apart and said: \"Now really, old fellow, this  won't do. Its--playing the devil with you. Come now, knock off for a  bit. I'll bet you a hundred dollars you can't confine yourself to claret  for a month.\"    And Harland Slack would answer:    \"Done! Have a cocktail?\" He usually paid the bet before three hours were  up. The limitation, he said, was too strict.    \"I'l"]]]
