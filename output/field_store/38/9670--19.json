It is  really a record of achievement made since 1903 when the plane built  by Professor Langley of the Smithsonian Institution came to utter  disaster on the Potomac. In 1917, at the time of writing this book,  there are probably thirty distinct types of airplanes being  manufactured for commercial and military use, and not less than  fifty thousand are being used daily over the battlefields of Europe.  No invention save possibly the telephone and the automobile ever  attained so prodigious a development in so brief a time. Wise  observers hold that the demand for these machines is yet in its  infancy, and that when the end of the war shall lead manufacturers  and designers to turn their attention to the commercial value of the  airplane the flying craft will be as common in the air as the  automobiles at least on our country roads.    The idea of flying like a bird with wings, the idea basicly  underlying the airplane theory, is old enough--almost as old as the  first conception of the balloon, before hydrogen gas was discovered.  In an earlier chapter some account is given of early experiments  with wings. No progress was made along this line until the  hallucination that man could make any headway whatsoever against  gravity by flapping artificial wings was definitely abandoned. There  was more promise in the experiments made by Sir George Cayley, and  he was followed in the first half of the nineteenth century by half  a dozen British experimenters who were convinced that a series of  planes, presenting a fixed angle to the breeze and driven against it  by a sufficiently powerful motor, would develop a considerable  lifting power. This was demonstrated by Henson, in 1842,  Stringfellow, in 1847, Wenham, who arranged his planes like slats in  a Venetian blind and first applied the modern term \"aeroplane\" to  his invention, and Sir Hiram Maxim, who built in 1890 the most  complicated and impressive looking 'plane the world has yet seen.  But though each of these inventors proved the theorem that a  heavier-than-air machine could be made to fly, all failed to get  practical results because no motor had then been invented which  combined the necessary lightness with the generation of the required  power.    In America we like to think of the brothers Wright as being the true  inventors of the airplane. And indeed they did first bring it to the  point of usefulness, and alone among the many pioneers lived to see  the adoption of their device by many nations for serious practical  use. But it would be unjust to claim for them entire priority in the  field of the glider and the heavier-than-air machine. Professor  Langley preceded them with an airplane which, dismissed with  ridicule as a failure in his day, was long after his death equipped  with a lighter motor and flown by Glenn Curtis, who declared that  the scientist had solved the problem, had only the explosive engine  been perfected in his time.    Despite, however, the early period of the successful experiments of  the Wrights and Professor Langley, it would be unjust for America to  arrogate to herself entire priority in airplane invention. Any story  of that achievement which leaves out Lilienthal, the German, and  Pilcher, the Englishman, is a record in which the truth is  subordinated to national pride.    [Illustration: Langley's Airplane.]    Otto Lilienthal and his brother Gustav--the two like the Wrights  were always associated in their aviation work--had been studying  long the problem of flight when in 1889 they jointly published their  book _Bird Flight as the Basis of the Flying Art_. Their  investigations were wholly into the problem of flight without a  motor. At the outset they even harked back to the long-abandoned  theory that man could raise himself by mere muscular effort, and  Otto spent many hours suspended at the end of a rope flapping  frantically a pair of wings before he abandoned this effort as  futile. Convinced that the soaring or gliding of the birds was the  feat to emulate, he made himself a pair of fixed, bat-like wings  formed of a light fabric stretched over a willow frame. A tail  composed of one vertical and one horizontal plane extended to the  rear, and in the middle the aviator hung by his armpits, in an erect  position. With this device he made some experimental glides, leaping  from slight eminences. With his body, which swung at will from its  cushioned supports, he could balance, and even steer the fabric  which supported him, and accomplished long glides against the wind.  Not infrequently, running into the teeth of the breeze down a gentle  slope he would find himself gently wafted into the air and would  make flights of as much as three hundred yards, steering to either  side, or rising and falling at will. He was even able to make a  circuitous flight and return to his starting place--a feat that was  not accomplished with a motor-driven airplane until years later.  Lilienthal achieved it with no mechanical aid, except the wings. He  became passionately devoted to the art, made more than two thousand  flights, and at the time of his death had just completed a  motor-driven airplane, which he was never able to test. His earlier  gliding wings he developed into a form of biplane, with which he  made several successful flights, but met his death in 1896 by the  collapse of this machine, of the bad condition of which he had been  warned.    [Illustration: (C) Kadel & Herbert.    _French Airdrome near the Front._]    Lilienthal was more of a factor in the conquest of the air than his  actual accomplishments would imply. His persistent experiments, his  voluminous writings, and above all his friendly and intelligent  interest in the work of other and younger men won him a host of  disciples in other lands who took up the work that dropped from his  lifeless hands.    [Illustration: Lilienthal's Glider.]    In England Percy S. Pilcher emulated the Lilienthal glides, and was  at work on a motor-propelled machine when he was killed by the  breakage of a seemingly unimportant part of his machine. He was on  the edge of the greater success, not to that moment attained by  anyone, of building a true airplane propelled by motor. Many  historians think that to Lilienthal and Pilcher is justly due the  title \"the first flying men.\" But Le Bris, a French sailor, utterly  without scientific or technical equipment, as far back as 1854 had  accomplished a wonderful feat in that line. While on a cruise he had  watched an albatross that followed his ship day after day apparently  without rest and equally without fatigue. His imagination was fired  by the spectacle and probably having never heard of the punishment  that befell the Ancient Mariner, he shot the albatross. \"I took the  wing,\" he wrote later, \"and exposed it to the breeze, and lo, in  spite of me, it drew forward into the wind; notwithstanding my  resistance it tended to rise. Thus I had discovered the secret of  the bird. I comprehend the whole mystery of flight.\"    A trifle too sanguine was sailor Le Bris, but he had just the  qualities of imagination and confidence essential to one who sets  forth to conquer the air. Had he possessed the accurate mind, the  patience, and the pertinacity of the Wrights he might have beaten  them by half a century. As it was he accomplished a remarkable feat,  though it ended in somewhat laughable failure. He built an  artificial bird, on the general plan of his albatross. The wings  were not to flap, but their angles to the wind were controlled by a  system of levers controlled by Le Bris, who stood up in the basket  in the centre. To rise he required something like the flying start  which the airplanes of to-day get on their bicycle wheels before  leaving the ground. As Le Bris had no motor this method of  propulsion was denied him, so he loaded the apparatus in a cart, and  fastened it to the rail by a rope knotted in a slip knot which a  jerk from him would release. As they started men walked beside the  cart holding the wings, which extended for twenty-five feet on  either side. As the horses speeded up these assistants released  their hold. Feeling the car try to rise under his feet Le Bris cast  off the rope, tilted the front end of the machine, and to his joy  began to rise steadily into the air. The spectators below cheered  madly, but a note of alarm mingled with their cheers, and the  untried aviator noticed a strange and inexplicable jerking of his  machine. Peering down he discovered, to his amaze, a man kicking  and crying aloud in deadly fear. It was evident that the rope he had  detached from the cart had caught up the driver, who had thus  become, to his intense dismay, a partner in the inventor's triumph.  Indeed it is most possible that he contributed to that triumph for  the ease and steadiness with which the machine rose to a height  estimated at three hundred feet suggests that he may have furnished  needed ballast--acted in fact as the tail to the kite. Humanity  naturally impelled Le Bris to descend at once, which he did  skilfully without injuring his involuntary passenger, and only  slightly breaking one of the wings.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _A German War Zeppelin._]    Had Le Bris won this success twenty years later his fame and fortune  would have been secure. But in 1854 the time was not ripe for aeronautics.  Le Bris was poor. The public responded but grudgingly to his appeals  for aid. His next experiment was less successful--perhaps for lack of  the carter--and he ultimately disappeared from aviation to become an  excellent soldier of France.

How do you  feel? Were you hurt?\"    \"Oh, I'm all right now--just a trifle dizzy. But I thought sure I was a  goner when I fell over the platform railing,\" and Mr. Damon could not  repress a shudder. Mr. Sharp administered some more medicine and his  patient was soon able to stand, and move about.    \"How did it happen?\" inquired the balloonist.    \"I hardly know,\" answered Mr. Damon. \"I was out on the platform,  looking at the view, and thinking how much better my neuralgia was,  with the scarf on. Suddenly the wind whipped loose one end of the  scarf, and, before I knew it the cloth had caught on the propeller  blade. I was blown, or drawn to one side, tossed against the railing,  which I managed to grab, and then I lost my senses. It's a good thing I  wasn't whirled around the propeller.\"    \"It's a good thing you weren't tossed down to the earth,\" commented  Tom, shivering as he thought of his friend's narrow escape.    \"I became unconscious, partly because the wind was knocked from me as I  hit the platform railing,\" went on Mr. Damon, \"and partly from fright,  I think. But I'm all right now, and I'm not going out on that platform  again with a loose scarf on.\"    \"I wouldn't go out at all again, if I were you, though, of course, I'm  used to dizzy heights,\" spoke Mr. Sharp.    \"Oh, I'm not so easily frightened,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"If I'm going  to be a balloonist, or an aeroplanist I've got to get used to certain  things. I'm all right now,\" and the plucky man was, for the blow to his  side did not amount to much. It was some time, however, before Tom got  over the fright his friend had caused him.    They spent that night moving slowly south, and in the morning found  they had covered about a hundred miles, not having run the ship to  anything like its maximum speed. Breakfast was served above the clouds,  for a change, Mr. Damon finding that he could stand the great height  with comfort.    It was three days after the start, and the travelers were proceeding  slowly along. They were totally unaware, of course, of the sensation  which their leaving, conjointly with the bank robbery, had caused, not  only in Shopton but in other places.    \"We're over a good-sized city,\" announced Tom, on the noon of the third  day. \"Suppose we drop down, and leave some message? Dad will be anxious  to hear from us.\"    \"Good idea,\" commented Mr. Sharp. \"Down it is. Shift the rudder.\"    Tom proceeded to do so, and, while Mr. Damon relieved him at the wheel  the young inventor prepared a message to his father. It was placed in a  weighted envelope, together with a sum of money, and the person picking  it up was requested to send the letter as a telegram, retaining some  money for his trouble.    As the ship got lower and lower over the city the usual crowds could be  seen congregating in the streets, pointing and gazing upward.    \"We're creating quite a stir,\" observed Tom.    \"More than usual, it seems,\" added Mr. Sharp, peering down. \"I declare,  there seems to be a police parade under way.\"    \"That's right,\" put in Mr. Damon, for, looking down, a squad of  uniformed officers, some on horseback, could be seen hurrying along the  main street, trying to keep pace with the airship, which was moving  slowly.    \"They're looking at us through telescopes,\" called Tom. \"Guess they  never saw a balloon down this way.\"    Nearer and nearer to the city dropped the Red Cloud. Tom was about to  let go the weighted envelope, when, from the midst of the police came  several puffs of white smoke. It was followed by vicious, zipping  sounds about the cabin of the ship, the windows of which were open.  Then came the reports of several rifles.    \"They're firing at us!\" yelled Tom.    \"So they are!\" cried Mr. Sharp. \"They must be crazy! Can't they see  that we're not a bird.\"    \"Maybe they take us for a war balloon,\" suggested Mr. Damon.    Another volley was directed at the airship, and several bullets struck  the big aluminum gas holder glancing blows.    \"Here! Quit that!\" yelled Tom, leaning out of the window. \"Are you  crazy? You'll damage us!\"    \"They can't hear you,\" called Mr. Sharp.    A third volley was fired, and this time several persons other than  police officers seemed to be shooting at the airship. Revolvers as well  as rifles were being used.    \"We're got to get out of this!\" shouted Mr. Sharp, as a bullet sang  uncomfortably close to his head. \"I can't imagine what's gotten into  the people. Send her up, Tom!\"    The lad quickly shifted the elevation rudder, and the Red Cloud sailed  majestically aloft. The young inventor had not dropped his message,  concluding that citizens who would fire on travelers of the air for no  reason, would not be likely to accommodate them in the matter of  sending messages.    The craft mounted rapidly upward, but before it was beyond rifle shot  another volley was fired, one bullet sending some splinters flying from  the wooden framework.    \"Whew! That was a narrow escape!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. \"What in the  world can those people be up to, anyhow?\"          Chapter 16    Over a Fiery Furnace      Down below, the aeronauts could see the crowd, led by the police,  scurrying to and fro. Many individuals beside the officers appeared to  be holding weapons, and, from the puffs of smoke that spurted out, it  was evident that more shots were being fired. But the bullets could do  no harm, and the Red Cloud, under the force of the rapidly revolving  propellers, was soon beyond the center of the city.    \"Well, if that isn't the limit!\" cried Tom. \"They must have taken us  for a German war balloon, about to drop explosives on them.\"    \"Bless my liver!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon, \"I believe you're right. Eh,  Mr. Sharp?\"    The veteran balloonist took a careful look over the craft before  replying. Then he spoke:    \"It couldn't be that,\" and he shook his head, as if puzzled. \"They  would know no foreign airship would try any trick like that. Beside, if  by some remote possibility they did imagine it, there would be soldiers  shooting at us, instead of the police. As it was, the whole population  seemed anxious to bring us down.\"    \"And they nearly did,\" added Mr. Damon. \"If they had shot a few holes  in the gas bag where would we be?\"    \"Right in the air,\" answered the balloonist. \"It would take several  volleys of bullets to damage our aluminum container. It is in sections  and when one, or even five compartments, for that matter, are pierced,  there is enough gas in the others to sustain us. So they could not have  damaged us much, even if they had shot a lot of holes in us. Even  without the gas container we can keep afloat by constantly moving, for  the planes will serve their purpose. Of course they could damage us,  and maybe put some of our machinery out of business, and that would be  a serious thing. But what puzzles me is why they fired at us at all.\"    \"It couldn't be out of pure mischief; could it?\" asked the young  inventor.    \"Hardly. If we were in a savage country I could understand the natives  firing at some such object as this airship, but the people of that city  must have known what our craft was. They probably have read something  about it in the news papers, and to deliberately fire on us, with the  chance of disabling us, seems worse than barbarous.\"    \"Well, we won't give 'em another opportunity,\" commented Mr. Damon.    \"No, indeed, not this city, but who knows but what the example may  spread? We may be fired at the next town we sail over.\"    \"Then steer clear of the towns,\" advised Tom.    \"Impossible. We must pass over some, but I'd like to solve this  mystery.\"    The day passed without further incident, though they did not go low  enough down over any city to drop any messages. It was decided that it  would not be safe.    \"We'll take a chance at night,\" suggested Tom, and that evening,  approaching a good-sized town in the dusk, several of the weighted  envelopes were dropped overboard. Doubtless persons walking along the  street, who were startled by hearing something fall with a \"thud\" at  their feet, were much startled to look up and see, dimly, a great,  ghostly shape moving in the air. But there was no shooting, and,  eventually, some of the messages reached Mr. Swift, in Shopton. But he  could not answer them for the airship kept on the move.    The night was spent floating in the air, with the engine stopped, and  the Red Cloud floating lazily this way and that as the gentle winds  shifted, for it was calm. The \"anchorage\" if such it may be called, was  above a sparsely settled part of the country, and if the lights of the  airship were seen from below, the farmers doubtless took them for some  new stars or, possibly, a comet.    \"Now then for a fast, straight run!\" cried Tom, after breakfast had  been served, and the big motor, with its twenty cylinders, started.  \"We'll be able to make the turn to-day, and then make for home, won't  we, Mr. Sharp?\"    \"Well, we could do it, Tom,\" was the answer, \"but I like this mode of  traveling so that I think I'll lengthen the voyage. Instead of turning  at Atlanta, what do you say to making for Key West, and then starting  back? That will be something of a trip. The Red Cloud is behaving much  better than I hoped she would.\"    \"I'm willing to go further if Mr. Damon is.\"    \"Oh, bless my shoe strings, I'm game!\" exclaimed the eccentric man. \"I  always did want to go to Key West, anyhow.\"    The craft was speeding along at a fast clip, and dinner that day was  served about three miles in the air. Then, desiring to test the gliding  abilities of the airship, it was sent down on a long slant, with the  propellers stationary, the shifting planes and rudders alone guiding it.    As the craft fairly slid down out of the sky, like a sled on a bank of  fleecy snow, "]]]
