The temperament is not without its influence. In those of lymphatic  temperament, pale blondes, who often suffer from local discharge and  weakness, the parts being relaxed, there is less pain and little or no  haemorrhage. In brunettes, who have never had any such troubles, the case  is reversed. The use of baths, unguents, etc., by the young wife,  however serviceable they might prove, is obviously impracticable. This  great change sometimes also produces swelling and inflammation of the  glands of the neck.    Marital relations ordinarily continue during the first few weeks to be  more or less painful. General constitutional disturbance and disorders  of the nervous system often result. These troubles are all increased by  the stupid custom of hurrying the bride from place to place, at a time  when the bodily quiet and the mental calmness and serenity so desirable  to her should be the only objects in view. Too frequent indulgence at  this period is a fruitful source of various inflammatory diseases, and  often occasions temporary sterility and ill-health. The old custom  requiring a three days' separation after the first nuptial approach was  a wise one, securing to the young wife the soothing and restoring  influence of rest. Nothing was lost by it, and much gained.    In a little while, however, all irritation should subside, and no  suffering or distress of any kind, whether general or local, should  attend upon the performance of this important function. The presence of  suffering now becomes indicative of disease. Of this we will speak  hereafter.      SHALL HUSBAND AND WIFE OCCUPY THE SAME ROOM AND BED?    One-third of life is passed in sleep. This period of unconsciousness and  rest is necessary for the renewal of vital strength, and upon its proper  management depends much of the health not merely of the husband and  wife, but of their offspring. A great deal has been written upon the  effect on health and happiness of occupying separate apartments,  separate beds in the same apartment, or the same bed. This vexed  question it is impossible to settle by absolute rules, suitable to all  cases. In general, it may be asserted that there are no valid  physiological reasons for desiring to change the custom which now  prevails in this and most other countries. When both parties are in good  health, and of nearly the same age, one bed-chamber, if sufficiently  roomy, may be used without any disadvantage to either. Such an  arrangement is also to be commended, because it secures closer  companionship, and thus developes and sustains mutual affection.    It is said that in Zurich, in the olden time, when a quarrelsome couple  applied for a divorce, the magistrate refused to listen to them at  first. He ordered that they should be shut up together in one room for  three days, with one bed, one table, one plate, and one cup. Their food  was passed in by attendants, who neither saw nor spoke to them. On the  expiration of the three days, it was usual to find that neither of them  wanted a separation.    As before stated, there are conditions under which sleeping together is  prejudicial to the health. A certain amount of fresh air during the  night is required by every one. Re-breathed air is poisonous. During  sleep constant exhalations take place from the lungs and from the skin,  which are injurious if absorbed. A room twelve feet square is too small  for two persons, unless it is so thoroughly ventilated that there is a  constant change of air. In fact, a sleeping apartment for two persons  should contain an air-space of at least twenty-four hundred cubic feet,  and the facilities for ventilation should be such that the whole amount  will be changed in an hour,--that is, at the rate of forty cubic feet  per minute; for it has been ascertained that twenty cubic feet of fresh  air a minute are required for every healthy adult.    Very young and very old people should never occupy the same bed. When  the married couple hold the relation to each other, in regard to age, of  grandfather and granddaughter, separate apartments should be insisted  upon.    Certain diseases can be produced by sleeping together. The bed of a  consumptive, it is well known, is a powerful source of contagion. In  Italy it is the custom, after death, to destroy the bed-clothes of  consumptive patients. Tubercular disease has, within the past few years,  been transferred from men to animals by inoculation. Authentic cases are  upon record of young robust girls of healthy parentage, marrying men  affected with consumption, acquiring the disease in a short time, and  dying, in some instances, before their husbands. In these significant  cases, the sickly emanations have apparently been communicated during  sleep. When, therefore, either husband or wife is known to have  consumption, it would be highly imprudent for them to pass the long  hours of the night either in the same bed or in the same room.      WHAT KIND OF BED IS MOST HEALTHFUL?    Feather-beds are not conducive to the health of either sex. Mattresses  made of wool, or of wool and horsehair, are much better. The bed should  be opened, and its contents exposed to the air and sunlight, once every  year. Beds long saturated with the night exhalations of their occupants  are not wholesome. A number of ancient writers have alleged--and it has  been reasserted by modern authorities--that sleeping on sponge is of  service to those who desire to increase their families. The mattresses  of compressed sponge recently introduced, therefore, commend themselves  to married people thus situated. Hemlock boughs make a bed which has a  well-established reputation for similar virtues.    The odor of cone-bearing trees has a well-known influence upon the  fruitfulness of wedlock. Those who live in pine forests have ordinarily  large families of children.    Excessive clothing at night is highly injurious. So also is a fire in  the bed-room, except in case of sickness. If the body be too much heated  during sleep, perspiration occurs, or the action of the heart is  increased, and the whole economy becomes excited. Either condition  prevents sound sleep and reinvigoration of the body. Wives in feeble  health, and those liable to attacks of flooding, should therefore have a  particular regard to the quantity of clothing on their beds.      THE DIGNITY AND PROPRIETY OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT.    A distinguished medical writer has divided women into three classes in  regard to the intensity of the sexual instinct. He asserts that a larger  number than is generally supposed have little or no sexual feeling. A  second class of women, more numerous than these, but still small as  compared with the whole of their sex, are more or less subject to strong  passion. Those of the first class can no more form an idea of the  strength of the impulse in other women, than the blind can of colors.  They therefore often err in their judgments. The third class comprises  the vast majority of women, in whom the sexual appetite is as moderate  as all other appetites.    It is a false notion, and contrary to nature, that this passion in a  woman is a derogation to her sex. The science of physiology indicates  most clearly its propriety and dignity. There are wives who plume  themselves on their repugnance or their distaste for their conjugal  obligations. They speak of their coldness and of the calmness of their  senses, as if these were not defects. Excepting those afflicted with  vices of conformation, or with disorders of sensibility,--which amount  to the same thing,--all wives are called upon to receive and pay the  imposts of love; and those who can withdraw themselves from the  operation of this mysterious law without suffering and with  satisfaction, show themselves by that fact to be incomplete in their  organization, and deficient in the special function of their being.  There should be no passion for one which is not shared by both.  Generation is a duty. The feeling which excites to the preservation of  the species is as proper as that which induces the preservation of the  individual. Passionate, exclusive, and durable love for a particular  individual of the opposite sex, it has been well said, is characteristic  of the human race, and is a mark of distinction from other animals. The  instinct of reproduction in mankind is thus joined to an affectionate  sentiment, which adds to its sweetness and prolongs infinitely its  duration.    Many physiologists have assigned to the feelings an important _role_ in  conception, the possibility of which has even been doubted if there be  no passion on the side of the woman. Although this extreme view is not  tenable in the light of modern research, yet all recent authorities  agree that conception is more assured when the two individuals who  co-operate in it participate at the same time in the transports of which  it is the fruit. It is also without doubt true that the disposition of  the woman at that time has much power in the formation of the foetus,  both in modifying its physical constitution and in determining the  character and temperament of its mind. The influence, long ago  attributed by Shakspeare to 'a dull, stale, tired bed' in creating a  'tribe of fops,' is not a mere poet's fancy.    In this manner also may be explained the results of prolonged continence  upon the offspring, for desires are usually vivid in proportion to the  previous period of rest. The father of Montaigne, returning after an  absence of thirty-two years, during which he was engaged in the wars of  Italy, begot his son, so justly celebrated in French literature. The  father of J. J. Rousseau, after a considerable absence in  Constantinople, brought to his wife the reward of a long fidelity.    Sexual passion exerts, therefore, a marked influence upon the future  being before conception, by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#16)"],[1,"all the  New.    When one has wallowed for a time with the Imagists and carefully  examined the _vers librists_, with the aid of a catalogue and  explanations, one turns to the \"Collected Poems\" of Walter de la Mare.  Come, now! Listen to this:        When slim Sophia mounts her horse        And paces down the avenue,      It seems an inward melody        She paces to.        Each narrow hoof is lifted high        Beneath the dark enclustering pines,      A silver ray within his bit        And bridle shines.        His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,        And streams upon the shadowy air,      The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,        His mistress' hair.        Her habit flows in darkness down,        Upon the stirrup rests her foot,      Her brow is lifted, as if earth        She heeded not.        'Tis silent in the avenue,        The sombre pines are mute of song,      The blue is dark, there moves no breeze        The boughs among.        When slim Sophia mounts her horse        And paces down the avenue,      It seems an inward melody        She paces to.    It is difficult for the simple minded to understand why Walter de la  Mare, who is a singer with something to sing about, cannot be classed as  an Imagist. He uses the language of common speech and tries always to  say exactly what he means; he suits his mood to his rhythm, and his  cadences to his ideas; he believes passionately in the artistic value of  modern life; but he does not seem to see why he should not write about  an old-fashioned a[:e]roplane of the year 1914, if he can make it the  centre of something interesting.    The professional Imagist tries to produce poetry that is hard and clear  and never blurred or indefinite, and he holds that concentration is the  very essence of poetry. The Imagist fights for \"free verse\" as for the  principle of liberty. But why does he fight? If \"free verse\" is musical,  if it expresses a mood or an emotion or a thought in terms that appeal  to the mind or the heart or the imagination, why should it be necessary  to fight for it? It may suit certain verse makers to make men of straw  in order \"to fight\" for them; but all the world loves a poet, if the  poet once touches its heart. \"The Toys\" of Coventry Patmore is a good  example of what \"free verse\" ought to be. But it is not free because it  is lawless; its freedom is the freedom of all true art which does not  ignore, which obediently accepts, certain laws that govern the  expression of the beautiful. Mr. Richard Aldington's \"Daisy\" is  certainly a less appealing poem than that one in which Swinburne sings  of the lady who forgot his kisses, and he forgot her name!    Jos['e] de Her['e]dia, in \"Les Troph['e]es,\" is both an Imagist and a  Symbolist. He has the inspiration and the science of the Sibyl without  her contortions. It is unfortunate that the truculent attitude of the  professional makers of \"free verse\" should have arrayed a small and  angry group against them; and this group will have none of Robert Frost,  who is certainly a poet and a poet of great courage and originality.  There are others, however, who may not be imitators of Robert Frost, but  who seem as if they were. Tennyson's \"Owl,\" which is looked on to-day as  an example of Victorian idiocy, is really better than Mr. T. S. Eliot's  \"Cousin Nancy\":        Miss Nancy Ellicott      Strode across the hills and broke them,      Rode across the hills and broke them--      The barren New England hills--      Riding to hounds      Over the cow-pasture.        Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked      And danced all the modern dances;      And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,      But they knew that it was modern.        Upon the glazen shelves kept watch      Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,      The army of unalterable law.    The Imagist does not believe in ornament, and this glimpse of character  might be uttered in one sentence. Perhaps, however, a tendency to  ornamentation might have made the poem at least decorative. After all,  when one has emerged from the rarefied atmosphere of the Imagist, the  Symbolist, and the _vers librist_, one swims into the splendours of  Francis Thompson as one might take refuge from a wooden farmhouse  unprotected by trees, in a Gothic spire, a Byzantine altar-piece, or a  series of Moorish arabesques. It is a frightful descent from the heaven  of Crashaw and the places of the Seraphim in \"The Hound of Heaven,\" by  Francis Thompson, to Richard Aldington.    Each lover of poetry has his favourite poem and his favourite poet, and  it has always seemed to me that one of the hardest tasks of the critic  is to decide on the position of a poet among poets, or of a poet in  relation to life. For myself, to speak modestly, I cannot see how I  could condemn the taste of the man who thinks that Browning and  Swinburne and Tennyson, and, in fact, nearly all the modern English  poets, deserve to be classed indiscriminately together as \"inspiring.\"  And I cannot even scorn the man who declares that Tennyson is _demod['e]_  because his heroines are in crinoline and conventional, and his mediaeval  knights cut out of pasteboard.    By comparison with the original of the \"Idylls of the King\" this  statement seems to be true. Sir Thomas Malory's knights and ladies--by  modern standards they would hardly be called \"ladies\"--do not bear the  test of even the most elemental demands of modern taste. They are as  different as the characters in Saxo Grammaticus's \"Hamblet\" are from  those in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet.\" But I may enjoy the smoothness of the  \"Idylls of the King,\" their bursts of exquisite lyricism, their  cadences, and their impossibilities, and at the same time read Sir  Thomas Malory with delight. When I hear raptures over Browning and  Swinburne, when people grow dithyrambic over John Masefield and Alfred  Kreymborg and others new--_chacun [`a] son go[^u]t_--I feel that by  comparison with Francis Thompson, these poets are not rich. They are  poor because they seem to leave out God; that is, the God of the  Christians.    Swinburne could never be a real pagan, because he could not escape the  shadow of the Crucifixion. Theocritus was a real pagan because he knew  neither the sorrow of the Crucifixion nor the joy of the Resurrection.  Keats was a lover of Greece, was ardent, inexpressibly beautiful,  sensuously charming; but Keats could no more be a real Greek than  Shakespeare, in \"Julius Caesar,\" could be a real Roman. Nor could  Tennyson, nor Browning, nor William Morris, nor the Preraphaelites be  really out of their time, for they could not understand the essentially  religious qualities of the times into which they tried to project  themselves.    If you compare the \"Idylls\" of Tennyson with those idylls of Theocritus  he imitated, you easily see that his pictures are not even bad copies of  the originals; they are not even paraphrases--to turn again from  painting to literature. They are fine in themselves, and the critics of  the future, more reasonable than ours and less reactionary, will give  them their true place. As for Browning, it is only necessary to read the  Italian writers of the Renascence, to find how very modern he is in his  poems that touch on that period. He is always modern. With all his  efforts he cannot understand that mixture of paganism and Catholicism  which made the Renascence possible. He seems to assume that the Catholic  Church in the time of the Renascence produced men in whom paganism  struggled with Christianity. The fact is that paganism had melted into  Christianity and Christianity had given it a new light and a new form.    It was not difficult for an artist of the Renascence to look on a  statuette of Leda and the Swan or Dana[:e] and the Descent of Jupiter as a  shower of gold, as prefiguring the Incarnation. There was nothing  blasphemous in this pagan symbolism of a pagan prophecy of the birth of  a God from a virgin. It does not follow that Browning is not powerfully  beautiful and essentially poetical, even when he reads modern meanings  impossibly into the life of older days. Nevertheless, he is  unsatisfactory, as almost all modern poets, when they interpret the  past, are unsatisfactory. A great poet may look into his heart and  write, but with Tennyson, with Browning, with Swinburne, one feels that  very often they mistake the beating of their own hearts for the sound of  the pulsations of the hearts of others.    Similarly, modern Christians who claim to be orthodox are sometimes  shocked when they are told that Saint Peter, for example, did not  believe that a man might not be both circumcised and baptized. According  to a common belief, the two could not exist together among the converted  Jews. And the modern man of letters seems to think that paganism and  Christianity were at odds at all points. A deeper knowledge of the  manifestations of religion, before the Reformation, would dissipate an  illusion which spoils so much fine modern poetry.    Another point, in applying my canons of criticism to poets whom I love  in spite of this defect, is that I find that they have no desire to be  united with God--you may call him Jehovah, Jove, or Lord, to quote Pope.  They are, as a rule, without mysticism and constantly without that  ecstasy which makes Southwell, Crashaw, and the greatest of all the  mystical poets writing in English, Francis Thompson, so satisfactory.    Wordsworth may have been transcendental, as Emerson certainly was, but  in different ways they made their search for the Absolute, and the  search, especially in Wordsworth's case, was fervent. Neither had the  splendours, the ecstasies of that love that casteth out fear, the almost  fierce and violent fervour of desire, reflected from the Apocalypse of  Saint John and the poems of Saint Teresa and of Saint John of the Cross,  which we find in Francis Thompson. In this respect, all modern poets  pale before"]]]
