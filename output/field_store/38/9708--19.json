However, it is common and good practice to provide shelter where they  can be housed at night and can take refuge from storms. A suitable house  for this purpose consists of a building 16 x 24 feet divided into two  parts with 200 ducklings to a side. This house is 5 feet high in front  and 3-1/2 feet in back. It is set on posts with a baseboard around it to  make it tight. It can be constructed of matched stuff or unmatched stuff  covered with paper. The front is left open but curtains are placed on  the front which can be used to close the openings so as to keep out the  snow. These are used only in the winter. When the ducklings are first  started in these sheds they are shut in when desired by means of wire  panels fitted into the lower part of the open front. The ducklings are  left in these yards and fed there until they are ready for market.    [Illustration: FIG. 32. Eat, drink and grow fat for tomorrow they die.  Fattening or yard ducks with fattening house or shelter used.  (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _Shade._ Shade is important for the ducklings as soon as the sun gets  hot. Exposure to the sun without shade will cause quite a heavy loss in  ducklings. If natural shade is not furnished by trees, some artificial  means must be adopted to supply the shade. This may take the form of  shelters or low frames covered with boards, brush or burlap.    _Feeding._ The first feed and water is given as soon as the ducks are  placed in the No. 1 brooder house or when 24 to 36 hours old. They are  fed 3 times a day, in the morning about 6 a. m., at noon, and at night  about 4:30 or 5 o'clock. The time of feeding should be regular, and  fairly early in the morning but not any earlier in the afternoon than  one can help so that the time between the evening and the morning feed  will not be too long. Some growers prefer to feed 4 or 5 times daily for  the first week or two. The birds are fed as much as they will clean up  at each feeding and if any feed is left it should be gathered up so that  it will not sour and cause digestive troubles.    The first feed consists of the following:--One measure corn meal, one  measure bran, one measure ground crackers, stale bread or shredded wheat  waste, one measure in 10 of beef scrap or fish, one measure in 6 of  creek grass or other very fine green stuff. Green rye or oats should  never be used for this purpose after it becomes jointed. If the feed is  mixed up with cold water about -1/2 measure of low-grade wheat flour should  be used to cause it to stick together. If hot water is used in the  mixing this is not needed.    Sand must be fed either by mixing it in to the extent of about 3% of the  ration or the sand can be fed separately in hoppers as previously  described. This same mixture may be fed in the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3  brooder houses, or in other words, until ducklings go to the yards, or  ration No. 2 given below may be substituted either at the start or after  a week or ten days. After the ducklings go to the yards the following  fattening ration is used: 200 pounds corn meal, 100 pounds low-grade  flour, 100 pounds bran, 1 part in 10 of beef scrap and 2 tubs or bushels  of green stuff. Some duck growers prefer to feed 300 pounds of corn meal  instead of 200 pounds. This ration like the other is fed 3 times a day.  Of course, there are many different rations in use with good results,  every grower having more or less personal preferences in this matter. A  proper proportion of animal feed, consisting of beef scrap or fish is  very important as the ducklings will not grow and make normal gains if  this is omitted or reduced in amount.    Much has been written about the feeding of celery seed to fattening  ducklings for the purpose of improving the flavor of the flesh and  formerly ducklings were advertised and sold as \"celery-fed\". As a matter  of fact, the amount of celery seed fed was small and it is questionable  how much influence it had on the flavor of the birds. At the present  time, celery seed is not used in fattening the ducklings on most of the  large duck farms of Long Island.    A comparison of gains made by ducklings on two different rations is  shown in the following table. Ration No. 1 consists of the fattening  ration given above. Ration No. 2 consists of 100 pounds bran, 100 pounds  corn meal, 50 pounds rolled oats, 50 pounds gluten feed, 10% beef scrap.  The ducks used were three days old at the first weighing and there were  27 in each lot. After the second weighing the number in each lot was  reduced to 24 ducks.

In doing this, especially when they are in fairly  large lots, they surge back and forth in the pens, running over one  another with the result that their backs are torn and scratched while  not infrequently more serious injuries result and may cause cripples.  To keep them quiet it is common to use lights at night. Formerly  lanterns were used but now on most duck plants electric lights are  available for this purpose. For a house 140 feet long, six 15-watt  lights scattered at equal intervals will be sufficient, and these can be  used in like proportion for houses of other lengths. The lights are left  on all night. Even when the ducks are half grown and may be out on the  yards it is still necessary to use lights on stormy nights so that they  will stay in and keep quiet and not get drowned in the rain. With a 16 x  24 foot house such as described previously, a single 25 watt light is  sufficient. Ducklings are especially likely to be stampeded during  thunderstorms and if a storm is coming up it is well to turn on the  lights and to shut the ducklings in their shelters when they are first  placed in the yards. One should not carry a lantern when moving among  the ducklings at night as this will cause moving shadows which are very  likely to frighten and stampede the birds.    [Illustration: FIG. 33. Another type of duck shed used on Long Island.  (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 34. Convenient feeding arrangements. At the right of  the feeding track runs a water pipe with spigots and pans at frequent  intervals. At the left are the feeding trays. (_Photograph from the  Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Pounds of Feed to Produce a Pound of Market Duck._ It is stated by long  established duck growers that from 5 to 7 pounds of feed is required,  this including the feed given to the breeding ducks for the season, to  produce a pound of market duck.    _Water for Young Ducks._ Drinking water is provided to the ducklings  while in the brooder houses by means of a piped supply. The drinking  pans are filled at each feeding time but at no other time. Water is not  left before them continuously while they are in the brooder houses as  they would be working in it all the time and this would keep them dirty  and make the house sloppy. After they are put out on the yards they may  or may not be provided with water in which they can swim. Most duck  growers on Long Island allow them to have access to water. While it is  undoubtedly true that swimming in the water induces them to take more  exercise and thus tends to reduce somewhat the rapidity of fattening, at  the same time it lessens the labor very materially as they do not need  to be provided with a supply of drinking water other than the water in  which they swim. Ducklings can be grown very successfully with only a  limited amount of water, that is, only enough to drink and in which to  wash themselves.    _Age and Weight When Ready for Market._ Ducklings are usually marketed  when they are 10 to 12 weeks old. A partial moult on the neck and breast  occurs about this time giving them a somewhat rough look. This indicates  that they are in proper condition to kill. If killing is not done within  a week after this moult starts they will begin to lose flesh and it will  be some time before they will fatten again. Ducks when ready to ship  will average from 5 to 6 pounds. A majority will weigh nearer 5 than 6  pounds. A pen of fattened ducks is driven up to the killing house and  into a pen where each one is caught up and examined to see if it is in  good condition. If the duck has a good smooth breast so that the  breastbone is not felt when handled and is well fleshed on the back it  is ready to kill. If it is not in this condition it is thrown out and  these thin ducks are returned to the yards for further fattening or are  utilized for shipping alive. Thin ducks are generally used for live  shipments as they will not shrink as much as well fattened ducks.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.

This species was common in the cocoa and surrounding secondary       forest at Quoin Hill, but I saw it only once in the moss forest on       the mountains near Tenom.         No specimen taken showed characters of or tendencies toward _C.       malabaricus suavis_. Perhaps the zone of intergradation on the east       coast is farther south than Darvel Bay, where it was placed by       Smythies (1960:390).         S. D. Ripley (_in_ Peters _et al._, 1964:72) considered _C.       stricklandi_ to be specifically distinct from _C. malabaricus_, and       his opinion is accepted here.    _=Enicurus leschenaulti borneensis=_ Sharpe: White-crowned Forktail.  _Specimens_, 4: 12 mi.

Gum-Gum: [Female], September 24, 1963, ADG  282.         I saw this species only once in life, along a small, wet-weather       stream. The specimens, however, were all netted in primary forest,       some distance away from any stream.         Judging from measurements, these specimens are _E. l. borneensis_,       although one would expect to find only _E. l. frontalis_ at       elevations of 600 feet. The specimen taken by Garcia at Gum-Gum was       not identified to subspecies.    _=Enicurus ruficapillus=_ Temminck: Chestnut-naped  Forktail.--_Specimens_, 3: 12 mi.

The many specimens of this species taken indicate the effectiveness       of mist nets in collecting birds in tropical forest. Although       Smythies (1960:398) considered this bird to be rare in Borneo, I       think that it is merely shy and retiring. We never saw the species       in the field and the specimens were all netted. The habitat was in       primary forest, except for that of MCT 3300, which was taken in       dense secondary forest. The two birds from 12 miles north of       Kalabakan were taken in a net stretched across a surveyor's       transect. The net was set on a hilltop and the birds hit it       approximately three feet above the ground. Two of the specimens       from the Cocoa Research Station are in juvenal plumage, indicating       that this species probably breeds in the area.    _=Cettia whiteheadi=_ (Sharpe): Short-tailed Bush Warbler.--_Specimen_,  1: 5.5 mi.

The specimen was netted in the moss forest, in fairly heavy       secondary undergrowth.    _=Prinia flaviventris=_ (Delessert): Yellow-bellied Wren-Warbler.--On  September 2, 1962, I saw several of these wren-warblers in a grassy area  near the golf course at Tawau.    _=Acrocephalus arundinaceus orientalis=_ (Temminck and Schlegel): Great  Reed Warbler.--_Specimens_, 6: Tenom: [Female], December 31, 1962, MCT  3546; [Male], January 1, 1963, MCT 3555; [Male], January 2, 1963, MCT  3565; [Female], January 4, 1963, MCT 3575; [Female], January 3, 1963,  MCT 3574; [Male], January 4, 1963, MCT 3579.         This species was common in the old paddy near Tenom, which has now       grown up to grass and shrubs. I saw one individual also in       shrubbery in Jesselton.    _=Phylloscopus borealis=_ (Blasius): Arctic Leaf Warbler.--I saw this  leaf warbler once in dense scrub in the moss forest near Tenom.    _=Seicercus superciliaris schwaneri=_ (Blyth): White-throated Flycatcher  Warbler.--_Specimens_, 2: 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male] testis 4 x 2 mm.,  December 23, 1962, MCT 3510; [Female], December 23, 1962, MCT 3511.         In the moss forest this was a common bird that hopped about in the       climbing bamboo and scrub.    _=Orthotomus atrogularis humphreysi=_ Chasen and Kloss: Black-necked  Tailorbird.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 4 x 2  mm., 6.5 gm., August 28, 1962, MCT 2827; [Female] oviduct enlarged,  brood patch, 5.5 gm., August 28, 1962, MCT 2828; [Male] testis 4 x 2  mm., September 26, 1962, MCT 2967; [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT  3336; [Female], November 28, 1962, MCT 3375.         These birds lived in the secondary forest-edge in dense shrubbery.       They were breeding at a time when most other birds seemed to have       completed breeding activities; most had begun the post-breeding       (prealternate) molt. On October 3, 1962, I saw two adults with two       young in nondescript juvenal plumage with virtually no markings and       a pale yellow color, unlike that of the adults.    _=Orthotomus sericeus sericeus=_ Temminck: Red-headed  Tailorbird.--_Specimens_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] with large  ovum, 10.8 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2770.         The bird was uncommon at the research station. The one specimen was       from the cocoa. I saw two others in secondary growth on the edge of       the forest. Possibly this species, like the preceding one, was       approaching full breeding activity.    _=Orthotomus sepium borneonensis=_ Salvadori: Ashy  Tailorbird.--_Specimens_, 8: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] vascular  brood patch, oviduct enlarged with one possible collapsed follicle, 7.8  gm., August 22, 1962, MCT 2797; [Female] imm., 8.0 gm., August 28, 1962,  MCT 2829; [Male], 8.8 gm., September 10, 1962, MCT 2896; [Male], 8.5  gm., September 10, 1962, MCT 2897; [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., 8.5 gm.,  September 11, 1962, MCT 2901; [Female] largest ova 3 mm., 8.5 gm.,  September 11, 1962, MCT 2902. Tiger Estate: [Female], October 11, 1962,  MCT 3000. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 20, 1962, MCT 3486.         This was the most common tailorbird in the Quoin Hill area.       Indications were that the species was also breeding (see _O.       sericeus_). Besides the above localities, I observed it 12 miles       north of Kalabakan. A male was heard singing on September 11, 1962;       the song was simple and on an ascending scale. The specimen taken       near Tenom was growing new tail feathers.    _=Rhipidura perlata=_ S.

This bird was one of the most common in the lower story of the       primary forest.
