And then, with an effort, I moved forward. My hand was outstretched to  grasp the wooden handle of the door. And--I did not have the courage.  Like a cowed beast I crept back to my place and slumped down on the  stool, my eyes still transfixed in a mute stare of terror.    I waited. For more than half an hour I waited, motionless. Not a sound  stirred in the passage beyond that closed barrier. Not a suggestion of  any living presence came to me. Then, leaning back against the wall with  a harsh laugh, I wiped away the cold moisture that had trickled over my  forehead into my eyes.    It was another five minutes before I picked up the book again. You call  me a fool for continuing it? A fool? I tell you, even a story of horror  is more comfort than a room of grotesque shadows and silence. Even a  printed page is better than grim reality!           *       *       *       *       *    And so I read on. The story was one of suspense, madness. For the next  two pages I read a cunning description of the prisoner's mental  reaction. Strangely enough, it conformed precisely with my own.    \"Fulton's head had fallen to his chest,\" the script read. \"For an  endless while he did not stir, did not dare to lift his eyes. And then,  after more than an hour of silent agony and suspense, the boy's head  came up mechanically. Came up--and suddenly jerked rigid. A horrible  scream burst from his dry lips as he stared--stared like a dead man--at  the black entrance to his cell. There, standing without motion in the  opening, stood a shrouded figure of death. Empty eyes, glaring with  awful hate, bored into his own. Great arms, bony and rotten, extended  toward him. Decayed flesh--\"    I read no more. Even as I lunged to my feet, with that mad book still  gripped in my hand, I heard the door of my room grind open. I screamed,  screamed in utter horror at the thing I saw there. Dead? Good God, I do  not know. It was a corpse, a dead human body, standing before me like  some propped-up thing from the grave. A face half eaten away, terrible  in its leering grin. Twisted mouth, with only a suggestion of lips,  curled back over broken teeth. Hair--writhing, distorted--like a mass of  moving, bloody coils. And its arms, ghastly white, bloodless, were  extended toward me, with open, clutching hands.           *       *       *       *       *    It was alive! Alive! Even while I stood there, crouching against the  wall, it stepped forward toward me. I saw a heavy shudder pass over it,  and the sound of its scraping feet burned its way into my soul. And  then, with its second step, the fearful thing stumbled to its knees. The  white, gleaming arms, thrown into streaks of living fire by the light of  my lamp, flung violently upwards, twisting toward the ceiling. I saw the  grin change to an expression of agony, of torment. And then the thing  crashed upon me--dead.    With a great cry of fear I stumbled to the door. I groped out of that  room of horror, stumbled along the corridor. No light. I left it behind,  on the table, to throw a circle of white glare over the decayed,  living-dead intruder who had driven me mad.    My return down those winding ramps to the lower floor was a nightmare of  fear. I remember that I stumbled, that I plunged through the darkness  like a man gone mad. I had no thought of caution, no thought of anything  except escape.    And then the lower door, and the alley of gloom. I reached the grating,  flung myself upon it and pressed my face against the bars in a futile  effort to escape. The same--as the fear-tortured man--who had--come  before--me.    I felt strong hands lifting me up. A dash of cool air, and then the  refreshing patter of falling rain.           *       *       *       *       *    It was the afternoon of the following day, December 6, when M. S. sat  across the table from me in my own study. I had made a rather hesitant  attempt to tell him, without dramatics and without dwelling on my own  lack of courage, of the events of the previous night.    \"You deserved it, Dale,\" he said quietly. \"You are a medical man,  nothing more, and yet you mock the beliefs of a scientist as great as  Daimler. I wonder--do you still mock the Professor's beliefs?\"    \"That he can bring a dead man to life?\" I smiled, a bit doubtfully.    \"I will tell you something, Dale,\" said M. S. deliberately. He was  leaning across the table, staring at me. \"The Professor made only one  mistake in his great experiment. He did not wait long enough for the  effect of his strange acids to work. He acknowledged failure too soon,  and got rid of the body.\" He paused.    \"When the Professor stored his patient away, Dale,\" he said quietly, \"he  stored it in room 4170, at the great warehouse. If you are acquainted  with the place, you will know that room 4170 is directly across the  corridor from 4167.\"           *       *       *       *       *          Creatures of the Light    _By Sophie Wenzel Ellis_          He had striven to perfect the faultless man of the future, and      had succeeded--too well. For in the pitilessly cold eyes of      Adam, his super-human creation, Dr. Mundson saw only      contempt--and annihilation--for the human race.    [Illustration]      In a night club of many lights and much high-pitched laughter, where he  had come for an hour of forgetfulness and an execrable dinner, John  Northwood was suddenly conscious that Fate had begun shuffling the cards  of his destiny for a dramatic game.    First, he was aware that the singularly ugly and deformed man at the  next table was gazing at him with an intense, almost excited scrutiny.  But, more disturbing than this, was the scowl of hate on the face of  another man, as handsome as this other was hideous, who sat in a far  corner hidden behind a broad column, with rude elbows on the table,  gawking first at Northwood and then at the deformed, almost hideous  man.    [Illustration: _The projector, belching forth its stinking breath of  corruption, swung in a mad arc over the ceiling, over the walls._]    Northwood's blood chilled over the expression on the handsome,  fair-haired stranger's perfectly carved face. If a figure in marble  could display a fierce, unnatural passion, it would seem no more  eldritch than the hate in the icy blue eyes.    It was not a new experience for Northwood to be stared at: he was not  merely a good-looking young fellow of twenty-five, he was scenery,  magnificent and compelling. Furthermore, he had been in the public eye  for years, first as a precocious child and, later, as a brilliant young  scientist. Yet, for all his experience with hero worshippers to put an  adamantine crust on his sensibilities, he grew warm-eared under the gaze  of these two strangers--this hunchback with a face like a grotesque mask  in a Greek play, this other who, even handsomer than himself, chilled  the blood queerly with the cold perfection of his godlike masculine  beauty.           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood sensed something familiar about the hunchback. Somewhere he  had seen that huge, round, intelligent face splattered with startling  features. The very breadth of the man's massive brow was not altogether  unknown to him, nor could Northwood look into the mournful, near-sighted  black eyes without trying to recall when and where he had last seen  them.    But this other of the marble-perfect nose and jaw, the blond,  thick-waved hair, was totally a stranger, whom Northwood fervently hoped  he would never know too well.    Trying to analyze the queer repugnance that he felt for this handsome,  boldly staring fellow, Northwood decided: \"He's like a newly-made wax  figure endowed with life.\"    Shivering over his own fantastic thought, he again glanced swiftly at  the hunchback, who he noticed was playing with his coffee, evidently to  prolong the meal.    One year of calm-headed scientific teaching in a famous old eastern  university had not made him callous to mysteries. Thus, with a feeling  of high adventure, he finished his supper and prepared to go. From the  corner of his eye, he saw the hunchback leave his seat, while the  handsome man behind the column rose furtively, as though he, too,  intended to follow.    Northwood was out in the dusky street about thirty seconds, when the  hunchback came from the foyer. Without apparently noticing Northwood, he  hailed a taxi. For a moment, he stood still, waiting for the taxi to  pull up at the curb. Standing thus, with the street light limning every  unnatural angle of his twisted body and every queer abnormality of his  huge features, he looked almost repulsive.    On his way to the taxi, his thick shoulder jostled the younger man.  Northwood felt something strike his foot, and, stooping in the crowded  street, picked up a black leather wallet.    \"Wait!\" he shouted as the hunchback stepped into the waiting taxi.    But the man did not falter. In a moment, Northwood lost sight of him as  the taxi moved away.           *       *       *       *       *    He debated with himself whether or not he should attempt to follow. And  while he stood thus in indecision, the handsome stranger approached him.    \"Good evening to you,\" he said curtly. His rich, musical voice, for all  its deepness, held a faint hint of the tremulous, birdlike notes heard  in the voice of a young child who has not used his vocal chords long  enough for them to have lost their exquisite newness.    \"Good evening,\" echoed Northwood, somewhat uncertainly. A sudden aura of  repulsion swept coldly over him. Seen close, with the brilliant light of  the street directly on his too perfect face, the man was more sinister  than in the cafe. Yet Northwood, struggling desperately for a reason to  explain his violent dislike, could not discover why he shrank from this  splendid creature, whose eyes and flesh had a new,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#16)"],[1," The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in  trust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou  hast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own  care. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my  own charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?\"    \"Aye,\" said Otto, simply, \"I am willing, for it seems to me that thou  art a good man.\"    The nobles who stood near smiled at the boy's speech. As for the  Emperor, he laughed outright. \"I give thee thanks, my Lord Baron,\" said  he; \"there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy  than that.\"    So comes the end of our tale.    But perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward, for no one  cares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.    Eight years had passed, and Otto grew up to manhood in the Emperor's  court, and was with him through war and peace.    But he himself never drew sword or struck a blow, for the right hand  that hung at his side was of pure silver, and the hard, cold fingers  never closed. Folks called him \"Otto of the Silver Hand,\" but perhaps  there was another reason than that for the name that had been given him,  for the pure, simple wisdom that the old monks of the White Cross on  the hill had taught him, clung to him through all the honors that the  Emperor bestowed upon his favorite, and as he grew older his words were  listened to and weighed by those who were high in Council, and even by  the Emperor himself.    And now for the end of all.    One day Otto stood uncertainly at the doorway of a room in the imperial  castle, hesitating before he entered; and yet there was nothing so very  dreadful within, only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his.  Poor little Pauline, whom he had not seen since that last day in the  black cell at Trutz-Drachen.    At last he pushed aside the hangings and entered the room.    She was sitting upon a rude bench beside the window, looking at him out  of her great, dark eyes.    He stopped short and stood for a moment confused and silent; for he had  no thought in his mind but of the little girl whom he had last seen, and  for a moment he stood confused before the fair maiden with her great,  beautiful dark eyes.    She on her part beheld a tall, slender youth with curling, golden hair,  one hand white and delicate, the other of pure and shining silver.    He came to her and took her hand and set it to his lips, and all that  she could do was to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom  she had heard so many talk; the favorite of the Emperor; the wise young  Otto of the Silver Hand.          Afterword    The ruins of Drachenhausen were rebuilt, for the walls were as sound as  ever, though empty and gaping to the sky; but it was no longer the den  of a robber baron for beneath the scutcheon over the great gate was  carved a new motto of the Vuelphs; a motto which the Emperor Rudolph  himself had given:    \"Manus argentea quam manus ferrea melior est.\""]]]
