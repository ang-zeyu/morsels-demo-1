The Duchess       of Sutherland, upon learning the fact, immediately directed       her to select one from Broadwood's.         \"We cannot refrain from quoting Mrs. Stowe's description of       the concert after dinner at the Stafford House:--         \"'The concert-room was the brilliant and picturesque hall I       have before described to you. It looked more picture-like       and dreamy than ever. The piano was on the flat stairway       just below the broad central landing. It was a grand piano,       standing end outward, and perfectly banked up among       hot-house flowers, so that only its gilded top was visible.       Sir George Smart presided. The choicest of the _elite_ were       there,--ladies in demi-toilet and bonneted. Miss Greenfield       stood among the singers on the staircase, and excited a       pathetic murmur among the audience. She is not handsome, but       looked very well. She has a pleasing dark face, wore a black       velvet head-dress and white carnelian ear-rings, a black       moire-antique silk made high in the neck, with white lace       falling sleeves and white gloves. A certain gentleness of       manner and self-possession, the result of the universal       kindness shown her, sat well upon her. Chevalier Bunsen, the       Prussian ambassador, sat by me. He looked at her with much       interest. \"Are the race often as good-looking?\" he said. I       said, \"She is not handsome compared with many, though I       confess she looks uncommonly well to-day.\" The singing was       beautiful. Six of the most cultivated glee-singers of London       sang, among other things, \"Spring's Delights are now       returning,\" and \"Where the Bee sucks, there lurk I.\" The       duchess said, \"These glees are peculiarly English.\" Miss       Greenfield's turn for singing now came, and there was       profound attention. Her voice, with its keen, searching       fire, its penetrating vibrant quality, its _timbre_ as the       French have it, cut its way like a Damascus blade to the       heart. She sang the ballad, \"Old Folks at Home,\" giving one       verse in the soprano, and another in the tenor voice. As she       stood partially concealed by the piano, Chevalier Bunsen       thought that the tenor part was performed by one of the       gentlemen. He was perfectly astonished when he discovered       that it was by her. This was rapturously encored. Between       the parts, Sir George took her to the piano, and tried her       voice by skips, striking notes here and there at random,       without connection, from D in alto to A first space in bass       clef. She followed with unerring precision, striking the       sound nearly at the same instant his finger touched the key.       This brought out a burst of applause.         \"'Lord Shaftesbury was there. He came and spoke to us after       the concert. Speaking of Miss Greenfield, he said, \"I       consider the use of these halls for the encouragement of an       outcast race a consecration. This is the true use of wealth       and splendor, when they are employed to raise up and       encourage the despised and forgotten.\"'         \"TUESDAY, May 31, 1853.         \"Miss Greenfield's first public morning concert took place       at the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square. She came out       under the immediate patronage of her Grace the Duchess of       Sutherland, her Grace the Duchess of Norfolk, and the Earl       and Countess of Shaftesbury. It commenced at three o'clock,       and terminated at five.\"    \"The London Morning Post\" says,--         \"A large assemblage of fashionable and distinguished       personages assembled by invitation at Stafford House to hear       and decide upon the merits of a phenomenon in the musical       world,--Miss Elizabeth Greenfield, better known in America       as the 'Black Swan;' under which sobriquet she is also about       to be presented to the British public. This lady is said to       possess a voice embracing the extraordinary compass of       nearly three octaves; and her performances on this occasion       elicited the unmistakable evidence of gratification.\"    \"The London Times\" said,--         \"Miss Greenfield sings 'I know that my Redeemer liveth' with       as much pathos, power, and effect as does the 'Swedish       Nightingale,' Jenny Lind.\"    Again: \"The London Observer\" remarks,--         \"Her voice was at once declared to be one of extraordinary       compass. Both her high and low notes were heard with wonder       by the assembled amateurs, and her ear was pronounced to be       excellent.\"    \"The London Advertiser\" of June 16 contained the following comments:--         \"A concert was given at Exeter Hall last evening by Miss       Greenfield, the American vocalist, better known in this       country under the sobriquet of the 'Black Swan.' Apart from       the natural gifts with which this lady is endowed, the great       musical skill which she has acquired, both as a singer and       an instrumentalist, is a convincing argument against the       assertion so often made, that the negro race is incapable of       intellectual culture of a high standard.... Her voice is a       contralto, of great clearness and mellow tone in the upper       register, and full, resonant, and powerful in the lower,       though slightly masculine in its _timbre_. It is peculiarly       effective in ballad-songs of the pathetic cast, several of       which Miss Greenfield sang last night in a very expressive       manner. She was encored in two,--'The Cradle-Song,' a simple       melody by Wallace, and 'Home, Sweet Home,' which she gave in       an exceedingly pleasing manner. The programme of the concert       was bountifully drawn up; for, in addition to the       attractions of the 'Black Swan,' there was a host of       first-rate artists. Herr Brandt, a German artist with a       remarkably sweet voice, sang Professor Longfellow's 'Slave's       Dream,' set to very beautiful music by Hatton, in a way that       elicited warm applause. Miss Rosina Bentley played a       fantasia by Lutz very brilliantly, and afterward, assisted       by Miss Kate Loder (who, however, must now be known as Mrs.       Henry Thompson), in a grand duet for two piano-fortes by       Osborne. M. Valadares executed a curious Indian air, 'Hilli       Milli Puniah,' on the violin; and Mr. Henry Distin a solo on       the sax tuba. The band was admirable, and performed a couple       of overtures in the best manner. Altogether, the concert,       which we understand was made under the distinguished       patronage of the Duchess of Sutherland, was highly       successful, and went off to the perfect gratification of a       numerous and fashionable audience.\"                *       *       *       *       *         \"In July she gave two grand concerts in the Town Hall in       Brighton, under the patronage of her Grace the Duchess of       Sutherland, her Grace the Duchess of Norfolk, her Grace the       Duchess of Beaufort, her Grace the Duchess of Argyle, the       Most Noble the Marchioness of Ailesbury, the Most Noble the       Marchioness of Kildare, the Most Noble the Marquis of       Lansdowne, the Earl and Countess of Shaftesbury, the Earl of       Carlisle, the Countess of Jersey, the Countess of Granville,       the Countess of Wilton, the Viscountess Palmerston, the Lady       Constance Grosvenor, and Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe.         \"_Vocalists._--Miss E.T.

But it is better  worth looking at, for all that, than the monument on the other side of  the church, where the recumbent form of Sir Arthur Onslow is apparently  giving vague directions to an imaginary audience. Wrapped in a Roman  toga, he waves a sleeveless right arm; his left is propped by a set of  Journals of the House of Commons. It is a relief to pass beyond such  tawdry pomposities into the solemn little chapel, sacred to one of the  great regiments of the Army, the Queen's, the old Second of the Line.  Their badge, the Lamb and Flag, and their name they get from Katherine  of Braganza, Charles the Second's queen. Later, as Kirke's Lambs, they  added to a dreadful fame at Sedgmoor; but rebellion breeds brutality,  and Kirke was probably no more ferocious than others who have had to  deal with insurgents. Since Sedgmoor, the Queen's, or to give them their  other and less distinctive name, the Royal West Surrey Regiment, have  served in practically every important campaign in which the Army has  been engaged. Their tattered banners, with the broken, proud  inscriptions of campaigns and battles, droop above long lists of dead.    Of the two other great Guildford churches, the lower, or Church of St.  Nicholas, stands at the bottom of the High Street on the far side of the  Wey. Probably it is the fourth church that has stood on this site; there  are at all events, records of three previous demolitions, though each  demolition has left one feature standing--the Loseley Chapel, belonging  to the Mores of Loseley Park. With the exception of this chapel, with  its brasses and monuments, dating back to the fourteenth century  memorial of Arnold Brocas of Beaurepaire (surely a name of names!), the  church is chiefly interesting as being a really satisfying piece of  modern architecture. It was built in 1875, and, though the interior,  with its modern glass and high colouring, has none of the quiet of age,  it dulls to the right tone at dusk.    [Illustration: _St. Mary's Church, Guildford._]    The Middle Church, St. Mary's, is the most interesting of the three. The  tower was built before the Conquest, possibly originally for defence: at  all events, there are two windows looking north and south which are  doubly splayed, after Saxon fashion, a good deal above the ground  level. The rest of the church has been built at different times,  beginning with the chancel, which is pure Norman, and there are actually  three levels to the floor, which gives rather an odd effect. The  proportions of the church have been spoiled by the cutting off of the  apse of the chancel--an entirely unwarrantable piece of destruction. The  history of the mutilation is characteristic of the days of the Regency.  George, Prince of Wales, used to drive down to Brighton, and perhaps his  coach stuck in Quarry Street, which must have been horribly narrow,  between the apse of St. Mary's and the town gaol opposite. He swore as a  Georgian prince should, offered the town a good round sum to have the  street widened, and the Corporation, who could have sliced something off  the gaol and harmed nobody, preferred to cut at the church. They never  got a penny of George's money.    But the most interesting feature of St. Mary's is the group of  wall-paintings in the chapel of St. John, north of the nave. These are  second in importance only to the famous painting at Chaldon, and have  been admirably explained by Mr. J.G. Waller, writing in the _Surrey  Archaeological Collections_. They belong to that curious age when  paintings on church walls were used as texts and preached from on  Sundays, to be scratched and whitewashed out of recognition in later  years by destroyers and \"restorers\" alike. The subjects chosen by the  painter in St. Mary's Church are peculiar and strangely grouped. The  centre of the group is a \"Majesty,\" the conventional representation of  the second coming of Christ. The head of the Christ has its nimbus; that  He is \"in his glory\" you can see by the mantle of royal purple, and \"the  holy angels with Him\" are represented by two little cramped figures, set  apart to make room for other drawings. Altogether there are six  medallions besides the \"Majesty,\" and there are also designs in the  spandrils above the arch, but these are separate from the subjects of  the medallions. The medallions, Mr. Waller explains, represent certain  scenes in the lives of John the Baptist, and John the Evangelist, though  only two of the stories depicted belong to the Bible. One of them, next  to the \"Majesty,\" shows the Evangelist seated in a caldron of boiling  oil, in which he is being held by a hideous tormentor with a pitchfork,  while a seated figure of Christ confers protection upon the Saint. In  another medallion the Evangelist is seen raising to life the dead  Drusiana, a lady of Ephesus who died just before the Apostle came to the  city; he is also shown turning sticks and stones into gold and jewels,  which he did in illustration of a sermon preached against riches. In a  third medallion the Saint drinks harmlessly from a chalice of poison  which has just killed two malefactors dead at his feet; and in a fourth  the other John, the Baptist, is painted with a rope round his neck,  dragged by an executioner before Herod. The executioner next beheads the  saint, and evidently sees some terrible portent on doing so, for his  hair stands on end, and his hand flies up in horror. The two other  medallions are separate subjects. In one, a figure with a rope round his  neck is dragged before Christ by demons; other demons, one red and one  white, scream and hold out threatening claws; perhaps their question is  \"Art Thou come hitherto torment us before the time?\" The other subject  is obscure. A Jew, apparently, is being baptised; and a deed with seals  is being examined by another figure, over a stream of water and blood.  Mr. Waller thinks that the reference is to a legend of a Jew who  desecrated an image of Christ with a spear, in imitation of the story of  the crucifixion, when out of the wound there gushed a stream of blood  and water. This miracle converted the Jew and his friends, who  immediately made over their synagogue to the Christian Church. That  would explain the sealed deed.    Other paintings in the spandrils--pictures of Soul-weighing and  Punishment--belong to other theologies. St. Michael holds the balance,  and a demon tries to press down one of the scales so that the soul being  weighed may kick the beam. But the subject of the painting is, of  course, older than St. Michael. The doctrine that souls are weighed, and  that devils and angels strive for the possession of them, is one of the  oldest in the history of the world's religions. It finds a place in all  the creeds; it belongs to Brahminism, to Buddhism, to Mahommedanism; it  is identical with the Ritual of the Dead of Egyptian mythology, in which  the souls of men are weighed before Osiris, and pray for mercy as they  are weighed. As at Chaldon, in another part of the painting the  condemned souls are being taken away. A demon carries them off, tied up  in a bundle, to the fires of hell. Doubtless the Guildford  congregations, listening Sunday after Sunday to the exposition of such  potent texts, came to have little taste for theology that was not served  up hot and strong.    Guildford has had other teachers besides theologians. The school, a  grey, venerable building, which fronts on the High Street above Trinity  Church, is the oldest in the county. It was founded in 1509, by one  Robert Beckingham, a rich London grocer, who owned property in  Guildford. But his benefactions did not permit any great latitude in  building, and it was not until Edward VI had given the school a charter  and a grant, and other great Guildford men had provided funds for  building and endowment, that the school, nearly at the end of the  sixteenth century, found itself in full working order. Since then it has  educated some famous scholars. Guildford's greatest man, George Abbot,  Archbishop of Canterbury; his brother, Robert Abbot, Bishop of  Salisbury; another brother, Sir Maurice Abbot, Lord Mayor of London;  John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich; Henry Cotton, Bishop of Norwich, and  his brother, William Cotton, Bishop of Exeter; Arthur Onslow, Speaker of  the House of Commons; Richard Valpy, author of the Greek grammar; and  Sir George Grey, the Colonial statesman, Governor in 1846 of New Zealand  and in 1855 of the Cape, are among its distinguished pupils. Of late  years, perhaps, Charterhouse has drained away some of the supply of  future Abbots and Onslows. But the school still flourishes, and the  memory of its \"great\" headmaster, Dr. Merriman, is kept green by  middle-aged Guildfordians.    Guildford's inns have been famous for centuries. Guildford is the only  town in Surrey which Camden mentions in his _Britannia_, as having good  inns; John Aubrey remarks that they are \"the best perhaps in England;  the Red Lion particularly can make fifty beds, the White Hart was not so  big, but has more noble rooms.\" John Taylor, the Water Poet, in his  _Catalogue of Taverns in Ten Shires near London_, made in 1636, goes out  of his way to mention particularly that Guildford \"hath very faire Innes  and good entertainment at the Tavernes, the Angell, the Crowne, the  White hart, and the Lyon\"; and Guildford only, of all the towns he  mentions, has all its inns either still standing or represented under  the same names, wholly or partially rebuilt. The Angel has kept more of  what is old than the others, including a panelled hall with a  seventeenth century clock, and some fine timber and brickwork best seen  from the inn yard. Under the Angel, too, lies one of a pair of vaulted  crypts which have puzzled all the archaeologists. The two crypts lie on  opposite sides of the street, and are beautiful examples of fourteenth  century work in chalk;"]]]
