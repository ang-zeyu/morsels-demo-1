Nevertheless, in spite of his haste, Sandy  tried as he went along to answer Donald's question.    \"There was a time long ago when all shearing was done by hand. In the  spring bands of traveling shearers came from ranch to ranch and sheared  the flocks for so much a day. Sometimes these men were Mexicans,  sometimes Indians. As they made a business of shearing and nothing else  they became verra skilful with the shears and could turn off many  fleeces a day. It is an art to shear a sheep. Many a try must you have  before you can do it. The smaller ranches still shear by hand, for it  does not pay to run a power plant unless you have large flocks.\"    \"I suppose a power plant does the work quicker,\" suggested Donald.    \"No, I think good shearers can clip the fleeces almost as fast. The  chief advantage in machinery is that it takes the wool off closer, and  you do not need such skilled men to do the work. You just have to  remember not to shear flocks this way in summer, for the wool would be  cut so close that your sheep would be wild with flies and sunburn before  their coats grew long enough to protect them.\"    They had now reached the plant, where they were to meet Donald's father  and Thornton; they mounted the steps of the low building and went in.  Immediately they were greeted by the whirr of wheels, the chatter of  many herders, and the blatting of sheep.    Mr. Clark came forward.    \"Well, Don,\" he said, \"this is quite a sight, isn't it?\"    \"I should say it was! I had no idea shearing was done this way. It is  just the way they clip horses or cut my hair.\"    His father smiled.    \"Yes, it is done on the same principle. Let us watch this man here. He  is just starting. I thought he would tie the feet of the sheep first,  but he does not seem to be doing it; instead he is turning it up on its  rump, and holding it with his left arm so its hoofs cannot touch the  floor. They say sheep never kick or struggle if their feet are raised  from the ground. Now he is starting with the shears. See! He is opening  the wool by a cut down the right shoulder. How neatly the fleece comes  off--almost in one piece, as if it was a jacket!\"    \"I guess that was a smooth-skinned sheep,\" laughed Donald, \"or the  shearer never could have done it so quickly.\"    The man who was shearing overheard him.    \"It was a smooth-skinned one,\" he called. \"Still, even the wrinkly  Merinos loose their coats pretty fast. Watch and see. I have one right  here.\"    Donald watched.    It was fascinating.    \"I'd like to try it,\" he said glancing up at his father.    \"I guess you'd have trouble!\"    \"I wouldn't mind the trouble if I wasn't afraid of cutting the sheep,\"  replied the boy.    \"Suppose you leave it until you come West the next time,\" called Sandy,  who chanced to be passing and heard his words. \"You mustn't do  everything this trip, or you'll have nothing to look forward to when you  come again.\"    \"Perhaps it's as well for the sheep!\" grunted the Mexican who was  shearing.    [Illustration: \"I'D LIKE TO TRY IT\"]    \"I shouldn't wonder!\" answered Donald good-naturedly.    But what a charm there was in that crisp snip of the shears!    At last, however, Donald and his father moved on to where crews of men  were busy at smooth board tables.    \"What are they doing here?\" Donald asked.    \"They are tying fleeces,\" explained Mr. Clark.    \"But don't they wash that dirty wool before they tie it up?\" questioned  the boy, astounded.    Sandy, who had joined them for the moment, laughed at Donald's disgust.    \"You'd have us washing and ironing it, perhaps,\" he chuckled. \"No, no!  We used to wash all fleeces before they were clipped, 'tis true. But  your father says that now buyers care little for them washed. Folks will  pay about as much for good wool unwashed as washed. It is a lucky thing  for us, because it saves us much trouble; more than that, it is better  for the sheep not to be put through the water. The thick fleece stays  damp for many days, and unless the creature is range-bred and therefore  used to all weather it suffers a shock, and is liable to be sick. You  can't shear a flock until about two weeks after washing, for not only  must the fleece dry, but new yolk must form in the wool. If the wool is  too dry the shears will not slip through it.\"    \"But by the end of two weeks I should think the sheep would have his  fleece all dirty again,\" objected Donald.    \"That is just the point--he does.\"    \"Why couldn't you wash the fleece after it is taken off?\"    \"We could. It is done sometimes. Your father can tell you that he sends  off wool and has it scoured before selling it if a buyer wishes it  done.\"    Mr. Clark nodded.    \"But here,\" continued Sandy, \"we wash no fleeces. We do take care,  though, not to tie very dirty pieces in with the fleece. My father  always insisted on the tying being honest. Only wool went into the  bundle. You and your father must watch and see how quickly they do the  tying.\"    As Sandy flitted away again Mr. Clark and Donald made their way to the  long table where the boys who went about among the shearers and  collected the fleeces were tossing them down.    Each fleece was spread out on the table, the belly and loose ends folded  deftly inside; then the whole was fastened into a square bundle.    \"It would seem as if any twine would do to tie a package like that,  wouldn't it, Don?\" said Mr. Clark.    \"Of course.\"    \"It is not so,\" went on his father. \"There is nothing about which a  wool-grower has to be more careful than about the twine with which he  ties his fleeces. You must always avoid using a fiber twine--by that I  mean hemp, or any variety having fibers which will break off in the  wool. These fibers or particles get stuck in the fleeces, and later when  the wool reaches the mill, the mill people do not like it. Either the  bits of hemp have to be picked out--an endless job--or the wool is sent  back. You can see that they could not dye wool with all these little  particles in it. The hemp would take a different color from the rest of  the wool, and would result in specked goods.\"    \"What kind of twine do we use, father?\" asked Donald, much interested.    \"We use a paper twine. Other growers often tie their fleeces with glazed  twine.\"    \"I never should have thought twine could make so much trouble,\" mused  the lad.    \"You would think of it, though, if you had once been set to picking  fiber out of wool as I was when I was a boy!\" interrupted Sandy, as he  darted past.    Donald and his father followed at the heels of the young Scotchman as he  went through into another shed where the wool was being packed. Here lay  great piles of tied fleeces and heaps of loose wool. About the shed  stood wooden frames from the center of which swung burlap sacks used for  packing the clip.    \"Why do the men first stuff the two lower corners of the bags with wool  and tie them?\" the boy asked after he had looked on a few moments.    \"We call those corners ears,\" replied his father. \"Sacks of wool are not  only awkward to handle but very heavy, and it is a help to have the  corners, firmly tied, to take hold of.\"    Donald nodded. He was too busy looking about him to reply.    The men packing the wool took one of the burlap bags, fitted its mouth  over a wooden hoop just the right size, and fastened the bag inside the  frame in such a way that it hung its full length and just cleared the  floor.    Then the packer began tossing wool into the sack.    When it was about half-full he jumped into it and tramped the fleeces  down solidly.    Afterward he climbed out and another man wheeled a truck under the  frame; then the packer freed the sack, and when it dropped it was  promptly sewed up and wheeled to the scales, where it was weighed. Its  weight was entered in a book by a man who kept the tally and the same  figures were also roughly painted on the bag.    \"And there's the end of it!\" exclaimed Sandy, who came up and stood  beside Donald as Mr. Clark walked away. \"Now you know the wool business,  Don!\"    Donald shook his head.    \"It will take me longer than this to know the wool business,\" he  answered. \"I mean when we get home, though, to get father to tell me the  rest of it--about the selling and manufacturing.\"    \"That part would be new to me too,\" said Sandy. \"Here we have no  selling; we do not even auction off our own wool, as you see, for our  clip goes direct to our owners. But when a ranch sells its wool to other  buyers the manager has lively days, I can tell you. Both Anchor and Star  Ranch sell to brokers. They send out word that they have wool for sale  and the Eastern buyers swarm here like flies. They bid on the wool--bid  right against each other, even though sometimes they are the best of  friends. The men get an idea of the price they want to pay by looking  over the fleeces and seeing how they will grade up. Above everything  else a wool buyer must have a trained eye, quick to detect the quality  of the shipment offered for sale. That is what decides him on how high  he will bid. After the buyers have got up to what they consider a  reasonable price they stop bidding. The wool-grower must then accept the  highest bid.\"    \"But he may not be satisfied with the price,\" put in Donald.    \"It makes no difference. They are supposed to make a fair bid on the  clip.\"    \"What if he shouldn't take it?\"    \"Why, then all the brokers who have bid on the wool leave town pledging  each other not to bid on that particular shipment of wool for two  weeks,\" replied Sandy.    \"Why?\" inquired Donald, opening his eyes.    \"It is to protect the brokers. You can see the justice in it when you  think a moment. These Easterners are busy men and they come a long way.  They can't take a trip to some far-off ranch only to find the  wool-grower has decided not to sell his fleeces; or that he will not  sell them below a certain price.

Victor with these, whoe'er oppose,  Thy hand shall conquer all thy foes,  Though Gods and spirits of the air,  Serpents and fiends, the conflict dare.  I'll give thee as a pledge of love  The mystic arms they use above,  For worthy thou to have revealed  The weapons I have learnt to wield.(165)  First, son of Raghu, shall be thine  The arm of Vengeance, strong, divine:  The arm of Fate, the arm of Right,  And Vishnu's arm of awful might:  That, before which no foe can stand,  The thunderbolt of Indra's hand;  And Siva's trident, sharp and dread,  And that dire weapon Brahma's Head.  And two fair clubs, O royal child,  One Charmer and one Pointed styled  With flame of lambent fire aglow,  On thee, O Chieftain, I bestow.  And Fate's dread net and Justice' noose  That none may conquer, for thy use:  And the great cord, renowned of old,  Which Varun ever loves to hold.  Take these two thunderbolts, which I  Have got for thee, the Moist and Dry.  Here Siva's dart to thee I yield,  And that which Vishnu wont to wield.  I give to thee the arm of Fire,  Desired by all and named the Spire.  To thee I grant the Wind-God's dart,  Named Crusher, O thou pure of heart,  This arm, the Horse's Head, accept,  And this, the Curlew's Bill yclept,  And these two spears, the best e'er flew,  Named the Invincible and True.  And arms of fiends I make thine own,  Skull-wreath and mace that smashes bone.  And Joyous, which the spirits bear,  Great weapon of the sons of air.  Brave offspring of the best of lords,  I give thee now the Gem of swords,  And offer next, thine hand to arm,  The heavenly bards' beloved charm.  Now with two arms I thee invest  Of never-ending Sleep and Rest,  With weapons of the Sun and Rain,  And those that dry and burn amain;  And strong Desire with conquering touch,  The dart that Kama prizes much.  I give the arm of shadowy powers  That bleeding flesh of men devours.  I give the arms the God of Gold  And giant fiends exult to hold.  This smites the foe in battle-strife,  And takes his fortune, strength, and life.  I give the arms called False and True,  And great Illusion give I too;  The hero's arm called Strong and Bright  That spoils the foeman's strength in fight.  I give thee as a priceless boon  The Dew, the weapon of the Moon,  And add the weapon, deftly planned,  That strengthens Visvakarma's hand.  The Mortal dart whose point is chill,  And Slaughter, ever sure to kill;  All these and other arms, for thou  Art very dear, I give thee now.  Receive these weapons from my hand,  Son of the noblest in the land.\"      Facing the east, the glorious saint  Pure from all spot of earthly taint,  To Rama, with delighted mind,  That noble host of spells consigned.  He taught the arms, whose lore is won  Hardly by Gods, to Raghu's son.  He muttered low the spell whose call  Summons those arms and rules them all  And, each in visible form and frame,  Before the monarch's son they came.  They stood and spoke in reverent guise  To Rama with exulting cries:  \"O noblest child of Raghu, see,  Thy ministers and thralls are we.\"    With joyful heart and eager hand  Rama received the wondrous band,  And thus with words of welcome cried:  \"Aye present to my will abide.\"  Then hasted to the saint to pay  Due reverence, and pursued his way.          Canto XXX. The Mysterious Powers.(166)      Pure, with glad cheer and joyful breast,  Of those mysterious arms possessed,  Rama, now passing on his way,  Thus to the saint began to say:  \"Lord of these mighty weapons, I  Can scarce be harmed by Gods on high;  Now, best of saints, I long to gain  The powers that can these arms restrain.\"  Thus spoke the prince. The sage austere,  True to his vows, from evil clear,  Called forth the names of those great charms  Whose powers restrain the deadly arms.  \"Receive thou True and Truly famed,  And Bold and Fleet: the weapons named  Warder and Progress, swift of pace,  Averted-head and Drooping-face;  The Seen, and that which Secret flies;  The weapon of the thousand eyes;  Ten-headed, and the Hundred-faced,  Star-gazer and the Layer-waste:  The Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,  The pair that wake and slumber not:  The Fiendish, that which shakes amain,  The Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:  The Guardian, and the Close-allied,  The Gaper, Love, and Golden-side:  O Raghu's son receive all these,  Bright ones that wear what forms they please;  Krisasva's mystic sons are they,  And worthy thou their might to sway.\"  With joy the pride of Raghu's race  Received the hermit's proffered grace,  Mysterious arms, to check and stay,  Or smite the foeman in the fray.  Then, all with heavenly forms endued,  Nigh came the wondrous multitude.  Celestial in their bright attire  Some shone like coals of burning fire;  Some were like clouds of dusky smoke;  And suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:  \"Thy thralls, O Rama, here we stand:  Command, we pray, thy faithful band\"  \"Depart,\" he cried, \"where each may list,  But when I call you to assist,  Be present to my mind with speed,  And aid me in the hour of need.\"      To Rama then they lowly bent,  And round him in due reverence went,  To his command, they answered, Yea,  And as they came so went away.  When thus the arms had homeward flown,  With pleasant words and modest tone,  E'en as he walked, the prince began  To question thus the holy man:  \"What cloudlike wood is that which near  The mountain's side I see appear?  O tell me, for I long to know;  Its pleasant aspect charms me so.  Its glades are full of deer at play,  And sweet birds sing on every spray,  Past is the hideous wild; I feel  So sweet a tremor o'er me steal,  And hail with transport fresh and new  A land that is so fair to view.  Then tell me all, thou holy Sage,  And whose this pleasant hermitage  In which those wicked ones delight  To mar and kill each holy rite.  And with foul heart and evil deed  Thy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.  To whom, O Sage, belongs this land  In which thine altars ready stand!  'Tis mine to guard them, and to slay  The giants who the rites would stay.  All this, O best of saints, I burn  From thine own lips, my lord, to learn.\"          Canto XXXI. The Perfect Hermitage.      Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,  And thus replied the anchorite:  \"Chief of the mighty arm, of yore  Lord Vishnu whom the Gods adore,  For holy thought and rites austere  Of penance made his dwelling here.  This ancient wood was called of old  Grove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,  And when perfection he attained  The grove the name of Perfect gained.  Bali of yore, Virochan's son,  Dominion over Indra won,  And when with power his proud heart swelled,  O'er the three worlds his empire held.  When Bali then began a rite,  The Gods and Indra in affright  Sought Vishnu in this place of rest,  And thus with prayers the God addressed:  \"Bali. Virochan's mighty son,  His sacrifice has now begun:  Of boundless wealth, that demon king  Is bounteous to each living thing.  Though suppliants flock from every side  The suit of none is e'er denied.  Whate'er, where'er howe'er the call,  He hears the suit and gives to all.  Now with thine own illusive art  Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:  Assume a dwarfish form, and thus  From fear and danger rescue us.\"(167)      Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:  The God a dwarflike shape indued:(168)  Before Virochan's son he came,  Three steps of land his only claim.  The boon obtained, in wondrous wise  Lord Vishnu's form increased in size;  Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,  God of the Triple Step, he passed.(169)  The whole broad earth from side to side  He measured with one mighty stride,  Spanned with the next the firmament,  And with the third through heaven he went.  Thus was the king of demons hurled  By Vishnu to the nether world,  And thus the universe restored  To Indra's rule, its ancient lord.  And now because the immortal God  This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,  The grove has aye been loved by me  For reverence of the devotee.  But demons haunt it, prompt to stay  Each holy offering I would pay.  Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill  These giants that delight in ill.  This day, beloved child, our feet  Shall rest within the calm retreat:  And know, thou chief of Raghu's line,  My hermitage is also thine.\"      He spoke; and soon the anchorite,  With joyous looks that beamed delight,  With Rama and his brother stood  Within the consecrated wood.  Soon as they saw the holy man,  With one accord together ran  The dwellers in the sacred shade,  And to the saint their reverence paid,  And offered water for his feet,  The gift of honour and a seat;  And next with hospitable care  They entertained the princely pair.  The royal tamers of their foes  Rested awhile in sweet repose:  Then to the chief of hermits sued  Standing in suppliant attitude:  \"Begin, O best of saints, we pray,  Initiatory rites to-day.  This Perfect Grove shall be anew  Made perfect, and thy words be true.\"      Then, thus addressed, the holy man,  The very glorious sage, began  The high preliminary rite.  Restraining sense and appetite.  Calmly the youths that night reposed,  And rose when morn her light disclosed,  Their morning worship paid, and took  Of lustral water from the brook.  Thus purified they breathed the prayer,  Then greeted Visvamitra where  As celebrant he sate beside  The flame with sacred oil supplied.          Canto XXXII. Visvamitra's Sacrifice.      That conquering pair, of royal race,  Skilled to observe due time and place,  To Kusik's hermit son addressed,  In timely words, their meet request:  \"When must we, lord, we pray thee tell,  Those Rovers of the Night repel?  Speak, lest we let the moment fly,  And pass the due occasion by.\"  Thus longing for the strife, they prayed,  And thus the hermits answer made:  \"Till the fifth day be come and past,  O Raghu's sons, your watch must last.  The saint his Diksha(170) has begun,  And all that time will"]]]
