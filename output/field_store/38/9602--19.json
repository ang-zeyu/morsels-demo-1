In conclusion I will enumerate the series of eighteen large pictures on  the side-walls and in the lunettes at each end of the room, representing,  with some few exceptions, the benefits conferred on Rome by Sixtus. The  most important of these pictures are above the windows (fig. 16), of which  there are seven on each side-wall. A Latin couplet above the picture  records the subject, and allegorical figures of heroic size, one on each  side, further indicate the idea which it is intended to convey.    The series begins at the east end of the room, over the door.      I. _Procession of Sixtus to his coronation._      Hic tria Sixte tuo capiti diademata dantur    Sed quantum in coelis te diadema manet.      ELECTIO SACRA.          MANIFESTATIO.    On the left of this, over the First Nicene Council, is      II. _Coronation of Sixtus, with facade of old S. Peter's._      Ad templum antipodes Sixtum comitantur euntem      Jamque novus Pastor pascit ovile novum.      HONOR.          DIGNITAS.    With the following picture the series on the south wall begins, above the  windows:      III. _An allegorical tableau. A lion with a human face, and a thunder-bolt  in his right paw, stands on a green hill. A flock of sheep is feeding  around._      Alcides partem Italiae praedone redemit      Sed totam Sixtus: dic mihi major uter.      JUSTITIA.          CASTIGATIO.      IV. _The obelisk in front of old S. Peter's. The dome rising behind._      Dum stabit motus nullis Obeliscus ab Euris      Sixte tuum stabit nomen honosque tuus.      RELIGIO.          MUNIFICENTIA.      V. _An allegorical tableau. A tree loaded with fruits, up which a lion is  trying to climb. A flock of sheep beneath._      Temporibus Sixti redeunt Saturnia regna      Et pleno cornu copia fundit opes.      CHARITAS.          LIBERALITAS.      VI. _A Columna Cochlis surmounted by a statue._      Ut vinclis tenuit Petrum sic alta columna      Sustinet; hinc decus est dedecus unde fuit.      SUBLIMATIO.          MUTATIO.      VII. _A crowd assembled in front of a church._      Sixtus regnum iniens indicit publica vota      Ponderis o quanti vota fuisse vides.      SALUS GENERIS HUMANI.          PIETAS RELIGIONIS.      VIII. _The Lateran Palace, with the Baptistery and Obelisk._      Quintus restituit Laterana palatia Sixtus      Atque obelum medias transtulit ante foras.      SANATIO.          PURGATIO.      IX. _A fountain erected by Sixtus._      Fons felix celebri notus super aethera versu      Romulea passim jugis in urbe fuit.      MISERATIO.          BENIGNITAS.      The next two pictures are above the arches leading from the west end of  the library into the corridor:    X. _Panorama of Rome as altered by Sixtus._      Dum rectas ad templa vias sanctissima pandit      Ipse sibi Sixtus pandit ad astra viam.      LAETIFICATIO.          NOBILITAS.      XI. _An allegorical representation of the Tiara, with adoring  worshippers._      Virgo intacta manet nec vivit adultera conjux      Castaque nunc Roma est quae fuit ante salax.      CASTITAS.          DEFENSIO.      With the following picture the series on the north wall begins:      XII. _Section of S. Peter's, with the dome._      Virginis absistit mirari templa Dianae;      Qui fanum hoc intrat Virgo Maria tuum.      AEQUIPARATIO.          POTESTAS.

XVI. _A similar view, with the Obelisk._      Transfers Sixte pium transferre an dignior alter      Transferri an vero dignior alter erat.      RECOGNITIO.          GRATITUDO.      XVII. _The Obelisk, now in front of S. Peter's, before it was removed._      Qui Regum tumulis obeliscus serviit olim      Ad cunas Christi tu pie Sixte locas.      OBLATIO.          DEVOTIO.      XVIII. _A fleet at sea._      Instruit hic Sixtus classes quibus aequora purget      Et Solymos victos sub sua jura trahat.      PROVIDENTIA.          SECURITAS.      [Illustration: Fig. 18. Rough groundplan of the great hall of the Vatican  Library, to illustrate the account of the decoration.]          CHAPTER II.    CHRISTIAN LIBRARIES CONNECTED WITH CHURCHES. USE OF THE APSE. MONASTIC  COMMUNITIES. S. PACHOMIUS. S. BENEDICT AND HIS SUCCESSORS. EACH HOUSE HAD  A LIBRARY. ANNUAL AUDIT OF BOOKS. LOAN ON SECURITY. MODES OF PROTECTION.  CURSES. PRAYERS FOR DONORS. ENDOWMENT OF LIBRARIES. USE OF THE CLOISTER.  DEVELOPMENT OF CISTERCIAN BOOK-ROOM. COMMON PRESS. CARRELLS. GLASS.      The evidence collected in the last chapter shews that what I have there  called the Roman conception of a library was maintained, even by Christian  ecclesiastics, during many centuries of our era. I have next to trace the  beginning and the development of another class of libraries, directly  connected with Christianity. We shall find that the books intended for the  use of the new communities were stored in or near the places where they  met for service, just as in the most ancient times the safe-keeping of  similar treasures had been entrusted to temples.    It is easy to see how this came about. The necessary service-books would  be placed in the hands of the ecclesiastic who had charge of the building  in which the congregation assembled. To these volumes--which at first were  doubtless regarded in the same light as vestments or sacred  vessels--treatises intended for edification or instruction would be  gradually added, and so the nucleus of a library would be formed.    The existence of such libraries does not rest on inference only. There are  numerous allusions to them in the Fathers and other writers; S. Jerome,  for instance, advises a correspondent to consult church-libraries, as  though every church possessed one[115]. As however the allusions to them  are general, and say nothing about extent or arrangement, this part of my  subject need not detain us long[116].    The earliest collection of which I have discovered any record is that got  together at Jerusalem, by Bishop Alexander, who died A.D. 250. Eusebius,  when writing his Ecclesiastical History some eighty years later, describes  this library as a storehouse of historical records, which he had himself  used with advantage in the composition of his work[117]. A still more  important collection existed at Caesarea in Palestine. S. Jerome says  distinctly that it was founded by Pamphilus, \"a man who in zeal for the  acquisition of a library wished to take rank with Demetrius Phalereus and  Pisistratus[118].\" As Pamphilus suffered martyrdom in A.D. 309, this  library must have been got together soon after that at Jerusalem. It is  described as not only extensive, but remarkable for the importance of the  manuscripts it contained. Here was the supposed Hebrew original of S.  Matthew's Gospel[119], and most of the works of Origen, got together by  the pious care of Pamphilus, who had been his pupil and devoted admirer.  S. Jerome himself worked in this library, and collated there the  manuscripts which Origen had used when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#16)"],[1,"superfluous, especially in the case of children as he advises it.    The Bengal pharmacopoeia contains the following official preparations:    _Compound Spirit_.--              Small pieces of moringa root    }          Orange peel                     }   aa 600 grams.          Nutmeg                                  20 grams.          Spirit of wine                           4 1/2 liters.          Water                                    1 liter.      Mix and distil 4 liters.    Dose.--8-30 cc. as a stimulant and diuretic.    _Compound Infusion_.--              Moringa root, small pieces, bruised }          Mustard seed                        }   aa 30 grams.          Boiling water                              1/2 liter.          Let stand 2 hours, filter and add          compound spirit.                           30 grams.      Dose.--30-60 grams a day, as a strong stimulant.    The expressed seeds yield a fixed oil, which is irritating and in my  opinion should not be used internally.    The green pods, the flowers and the tender shoots of the leaves are  eaten stewed. The juice of the leaves is given internally in India,  as an emetic, in doses of 30 grams.    Botanical Description.--A well-known tree, 5-6 meters high. Leaves  3-pinnate, their terminal divisions odd-pinnate. Leaflets oval,  glabrous, entire. Calyx, 5 unequal petaloid segments, imbricated,  caducous. Corolla white, 5 unequal petals. Stamens inserted on the  border of a disc, unequal, 5 opposite the petals bearing anthers,  5 alternate without anthers. Anthers dorsal, unilocular. Ovary  pedunculate, lanceolate, unilocular, with many ovules in 2 series,  inserted on the parietal placentæ. Fruit a pod terminating in a beak,  3-valved. Seeds numerous, very large, winged, embedded in a spongy  substance.    Habitat.--Common throughout the islands. Blooms in November.          LEGUMINOSÆ. (PAPILIONACEÆ.)    Pulse Family.        _Agati grandiflora_, Desv. (_Sesbania grandiflora_, Pers.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Katuray_, Tag.    Uses.--The flowers are edible. They and the leaves are purgative  and are given in decoction for this purpose, 30-40 grams to 200 of  water. The juice of the flowers is a popular remedy in India, for  migraine and coryza. The trunk bark is bitter and tonic.    Botanical Description.--A tree, 4-6 meters high, with drooping  limbs; leaves long, very narrow, abruptly pinnate; many caducous  leaflets, linear, elliptical. Flowers large, white, fragrant, in  axillary racemes. Calyx bell-shaped with two indistinct lips. Corolla  papilionaceous, white. Standard oval, a slight notch at the apex. Wings  almost as large as the keel which is strongly arched. Stamens 10,  diadelphous. Anthers uniform. Style and stamens equally long. Stigma  a small head. Pod 1-2° long, linear, 4-sided, containing many oval  seeds, separated by filamentous partitions.    Habitat.--Grows in all sections of Luzon and Panay.        _Abrus precatorius_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Saga_, _Sagamamin_, _Bangati_, Tag.; _Bangati Gikosgikos_,  Vis.; _Kanaasaga_, Pam.; _Bugayon_, Iloc.; _Jequiriti_, _Prayerbeads_,  Eng.    Uses.--The part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the  seed, the size of a small pea, bright red with a black spot, hard and  shining. The Filipino children use them to make rosaries and other  decorations. In the distant past the Filipinos used these seeds to  weigh gold, a practice followed even to-day by the Hindoos. The famous  Susrutas, author of the \"Ayur Veda,\" recommends them internally for  nervous diseases; modern therapeutics, however, limits their use  to one disease, though that is frequent and stubborn enough, namely  chronic granular conjunctivitis.    Some physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the  contrary, but the fact that they are used as food among the poor  classes of Egypt, demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive  tract at least; when introduced into the circulation they undoubtedly  exercise a toxic effect. We have already mentioned that their use  is limited nowadays to the therapeutics of the eye; the decoction of  the seeds known in Europe under the name of \"Jaqueriti\"--so named in  Brazil--produces a purulent inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and  it is precisely this counter-irritant effect which makes it useful in  chronic granular conjunctivitis, the persistence of which has defied  the most heroic measures of therapeutics. The French oculist, Dr. de  Wecker, was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose, in the  form of a 24 hours' maceration of the seeds, 10 grams to 500 grams of  water. It is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with  this several applications a day are made. It is now known that the  inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germ-life  contained in the solution but by an inorganic ferment discovered  by Bruylans and Venneman and named jequiritin; they state that it  is produced during the germination of the seeds or of the cells in  the powdered seeds. Warden and Waddell, of Calcutta, have isolated  an essential oil, an acid named \"ábric\" and an amorphous substance  called abrin, obtained by precipitation with alcohol from a watery  infusion of the pulverized seeds. Its action is identical with that of  \"jequiritin.\"    The infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating  application to indolent ulcers.    The root is a good substitute for licorice, is emollient and has an  agreeable taste. The extract is useful in catarrhal diseases of the  bronchi and in dysuria. The leaves contain the same properties as  the root and an extract prepared from them is used as a substitute  for licorice.    Botanical Description.--A vine, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate,  a stylet taking the place of the terminal leaflet. Leaflets linear,  entire, glabrous, tipped with a small point. Common petiole with  2 awl-shaped stipules at the base. Flowers in small racemes. Calyx  gamosepalous, caducous, 4-5 short teeth. Corolla papilionaceous, wings  horizontal. Stamens 9, monadelphous with bilocular anthers. Style  very short. Stigma globose. Pod 4-5 cm. long, truncate at the ends,  with 5-6 red seeds, each with a black spot.    Habitat.--Common in all mountainous regions of the islands. Grows  near houses and roads.        _Mucuna pruriens_, DC. (_M. prurita_, Hook.; _M. utilis_, Wall.;  _Dolichos pruriens_, L.; _Carpopogon pruriens_, Roxb.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Nipay_, _Lipay_, Vis.    Uses.--The pods are official as an anthelmintic in the Pharmacopoeia  of India. They are used in the form of an electuary triturated to the  proper consistency with honey or syrup. The dose for adults is one  soupspoonful, and for children a teaspoonful, given every morning  for 3-4 consecutive days. The last day a purge is given to expel  the lumbricoids.    Botanical Description.--A vine with ternate leaves. Flowers red,  keel larger than the standard and wings. Pods about as thick as the  little finger, lacking transverse grooves, curved in the form of the  letter f, covered with bright red down, which causes an unendurable  itching. They are divided into 3 or 4 oblique cells each containing  a brown, shiny seed.    Habitat.--Luzon and Panay.        _Erythrina Indica_, Lam. (_E. corallodendron_, L.; _E. carnea_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Dapdap_, _Kasindik_, Tag.; _Dapdap_, _Kabrab_, Vis.;  _Dapdap_, _Sulbang_, Pam.; _Indian Coral Tree_, Eng.    Uses.--This tree is well known on account of the beauty of its  crimson flowers. The decoction of the leaves is a useful cleansing  and deodorizing application for ulcers. The bruised leaves are used  locally in painful affections of the joints and to abort syphilitic  buboes and abscesses of all kinds. The juice of the tender leaves  is used in Concan to destroy maggots in ulcers, and the powder has  a similar use. A decoction is used locally in ophthalmia.    The root and the leaves are used as a febrifuge in the Philippines and  in India, according to Wight. In Brazil the bark is given in small  repeated doses as a hypnotic and in the Philippines as a diuretic  and purgative; a decoction of the leaves is similarly used. The  bark contains an alkaloid discovered by Rochefontaine and Rey, called  _erythrin_, which acts upon the central nervous system, diminishing its  normal functions even to the point of abolishment, without modifying  motor excitability or muscular contractility. W. Young isolated  a glucoside, _migarrhin_, similar to saponin, but possessing the  additional property of dilating the pupil.    In bronchitis with dyspnoea the following infusion of bark is very  useful:              Fresh bark,                 }          Freshly bruised leaves,     } aa  2 grams.          Water                         1,500 grams.    Boil till reduced one-half, filter and add:            Simple syrup                    200 grams.      Dose: Wineglassful every two hours.    Botanical Description.--A large tree, 20° high, thorny, with ternate  leaves. Leaflets rhomboid, broad, entire, glabrous. Secondary petioles:  that of the middle leaflet long, bearing 2 glands, those of the others  short, bearing 1 gland each. The leaves fall at the end of the rainy  season and the flowers bloom. They are a handsome scarlet color,  large, in terminal racemes. Calyx half-cylindrical, oblique, truncate,  entire. Corolla papilionaceous; standard elongated, lanceolate. Wings  short. Keel very short, 2-lobuled. Stamens diadelphous. Anthers  large. Ovary woolly. Stigma thick. Pod curved, rounded, furrowed in  parts corresponding to the seeds which are numerous, oval, pointed  at the ends.    Habitat.--Common throughout the islands. Blooms in February.        _Clitoria ternatea,_ L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Kolokanting_, _Pakingang_, Tag.; _Kolokating_, Vis.;  _Butterfly-pea_, Eng.    Uses.--The pounded seeds mixed with oil are used locally for painful  joints. They possess purgative and emetic properties and Dr. J. Shartt  has employed"]]]
