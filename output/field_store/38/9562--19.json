This picture is also a landmark in the history of Raphael, for it  shows the perfection of his second manner, and the change that had come  over him from his Florentine experience and associations. His earlier  pictures had been full of a sweet, unearthly feeling, and a color which  could be called spiritual was spread over them; now his madonnas were like  beautiful, earthly mothers, his colors were deep and rich, and his  landscapes were often replaced by architectural backgrounds which gave a  stately air where all before had been simplicity. His skill in grouping,  in color, and in drapery was now marvellous, and when in 1508 the Pope,  who had seen some of his works, summoned him to Rome, he went, fully  prepared for the great future which was before him, and now began his  third, or Roman manner of painting.    This pope was Julius II., who held a magnificent court and was ambitious  for glory in every department of life--as a temporal as well as a  spiritual ruler, and as a patron of art and letters as well as in his  office of the Protector of the Holy Church. He had vast designs for the  adornment of Rome, and immediately employed Raphael in the decoration of  the first of the Stanze, or halls of the Vatican, four of which he  ornamented with magnificent frescoes before his death. He also executed  wall-paintings in the Chigi Palace, and in a chapel of the Church of Santa  Maria della Pace.    With the exception of a short visit to Florence, Raphael passed the  remainder of his life in Rome. The amount of work which he did as an  architect, sculptor, and painter was marvellous, and would require the  space of a volume to follow it, and name all his achievements, step by  step, so I shall only tell you of some of his best-known works and those  which are most often mentioned.    While he was working upon the halls of the Vatican Julius II. died. He was  succeeded by Leo X., who also was a generous patron to Raphael, who thus  suffered no loss of occupation from the change of popes. The artist became  very popular and rich; he had many pupils, and was assisted by them in his  great frescoes, not only in the Vatican, but also in the Farnesina Villa  or Chigi Palace. Raphael had the power to attach men to him with devoted  affection, and his pupils gave him personal service gladly; he was often  seen in the street with numbers of them in attendance, just as the nobles  were followed by their squires and pages. He built himself a house in a  quarter of the city called the Borgo, not far from the Church of St.  Peter's, and during the remainder of his life was attended by prosperity  and success.    One of the important works which he did for Leo X. was the making of  cartoons, or designs to be executed in tapestry for the decoration of the  Sistine Chapel, where Michael Angelo had painted his great frescoes. The  Pope ordered these tapestries to be woven in the looms of Flanders, from  the richest materials, and a quantity of gold thread was used in them.  They were completed and sent to Rome in 1519, and were exhibited to the  people the day after Christmas, when all the city flocked to see them. In  1527, when the Constable de Bourbon allowed the French soldiers to sack  Rome, these tapestries were carried away. In 1553 they were restored; but  one was missing, and it is believed that it had been destroyed for the  sake of the gold thread which was in it. Again, in 1798, the French  carried them away and sold them to a Jew in Leghorn, who burned one of the  pieces; but his gain in gold was so little that he preserved the others,  and Pius VII. bought them and restored them to the Vatican. The cartoons,  however, are far more important than the tapestries, because they are the  work of Raphael himself. The weavers at Arras tossed them aside after  using them, and some were torn; but a century later the artist Rubens  learned that they existed, and advised King Charles I. of England to buy  them. This he did, and thus the cartoons met with as many ups and downs as  the tapestries had had. When they reached England they were in strips; the  workmen had cut them for their convenience. After the king was executed  Cromwell bought the cartoons for three hundred pounds. When Charles II.  was king and in great need of money he was sorely tempted to sell them to  Louis XIV., who coveted them, and wished to add them to the treasures of  France; but Lord Danby persuaded Charles to keep them. In 1698 they were  barely saved from fire at Whitehall, and finally, by command of William  III., they were properly repaired and a room was built at Hampton Court to  receive them, by the architect, Sir Christopher Wren. At present they are  in the South Kensington Museum, London. Of the original eleven only seven  remain.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE SISTINE MADONNA.]    Both Henry VIII. and Francis I. had received presents of pictures by  Raphael: we have told of the occasion when the St. George was sent to  England. The \"Archangel Michael\" and the \"Large Holy Family of the Louvre\"  were given to Francis I. by Lorenzo de Medici, who sent them overland on  mules to the Palace of Fontainebleau. Francis was so charmed with these  works that he presented Raphael so large a sum that he was unwilling to  accept it without sending the king still other pictures; so he sent the  sovereign another painting, and to the king's sister, Queen Margaret of  Navarre, he gave a picture of St. Margaret overcoming the dragon. Then  Francis gave Raphael many thanks and another rich gift of money. Besides  this he invited Raphael to come to his court, as did also the king of  England; but the artist preferred to remain where he was already so  prosperous and happy.    About 1520 Raphael painted the famous Sistine Madonna, now the pride of  the Dresden Gallery. It is named from St. Sixtus, for whose convent, at  Piacenza, it was painted: the picture of this saint, too, is in the lower  part of the picture, with that of St. Barbara. No sketch or drawing of  this work was ever found, and it is believed that the great artist,  working as if inspired, sketched it and finished it on the canvas where it  is. It was originally intended for a _drappellone_, or procession  standard, but the monks used it for an altar-piece (Fig. 43).    While Raphael accomplished so much as a painter, he by no means gave all  his time or thought to a single art. He was made superintendent of the  building of St. Peter's in 1514, and made many architectural drawings for  that church; he was also much interested in the excavations of ancient  Rome, and made immense numbers of drawings of various sorts. As a sculptor  he made models and designs, and there is in the Church of Santa Maria del  Popolo, in Rome, a statue of Jonah sitting on a whale, said to have been  modelled by Raphael and put into marble by Lorenzetto Latti.    Raphael was also interested in what was happening outside the world of  art; he corresponded with scholars of different countries, and sent men to  make drawings of places and objects which he could not go to see. He was  also generous to those less fortunate than himself, and gave encouragement  and occupation to many needy men.    At one time he expected to marry Maria de Bibiena, a niece of Cardinal  Bibiena; but she died before the time for the marriage came.    While Raphael was making his great successes in Rome, other famous artists  also were there, and there came to be much discussion as to their merits,  and especially as to the comparative worth of Michael Angelo and Raphael.  At last, when this feeling of rivalry was at its height, the Cardinal  Giulio de Medici, afterward Pope Clement VII., gave orders to Raphael and  Sebastian del Piombo to paint two large pictures for the Cathedral of  Narbonne. The subject of Sebastian's picture was the \"Raising of Lazarus,\"  and it has always been said that Michael Angelo made the drawing for it.    Raphael's picture was the \"Transfiguration,\" and proved to be his last  work, for before it was finished he was attacked by fever, and died on  Good Friday, 1620, which was the thirty-seventh anniversary of his birth.  All Rome mourned for him; his body was laid in state, and the  Transfiguration was placed near it. Those who had known him went to weep  while they gazed upon his face for the last time.    He had chosen his grave in the Pantheon, near to that of Maria Bibiena,  his betrothed bride. The ceremonies of his burial were magnificent, and  his body was followed by an immense throng dressed in mourning. Above his  tomb was placed an inscription in Latin, written by Pietro Bembo, which  has for its last sentence these words: \"This is that Raphael by whom  Nature feared to be conquered while he lived, and to die when he died.\"  Raphael had also requested Lorenzo Lorenzetti to make a statue of the  Virgin to be placed above his resting-place. He left a large estate, and  gave his works of art to his pupils Giulio Romano and Francesco Penni; his  house to Cardinal Bibiena; a sum to buy another house, the rent of which  should pay for twelve masses to be said monthly, for the repose of his  soul, from the altar near his grave; this was observed until 1705, when  the income from the house was not enough to support these services.    For many years there was a skull at the Academy of St. Luke, in Rome,  which was called that of Raphael; but there was no proof of this, and in  1833 some antiquarians received the consent of the Pope to their searching  for the bones of Raphael in his grave in the Pantheon. After five days of  careful work, and removing the pavement in several places, the skeleton of  the great master was found, and with it such proofs of its being his as  left no room for doubt. Then a second great funeral service was held; the  Pope, Gregory XVI., gave a marble sarcophagus in which the bones were  placed, and reverently restored to their first resting-place.

Captain Samuel Alexander commanded one of the companies close  to the fort, and could see and recognize his venerable father, who had  been placed in an exposed position by Brown.    It is not necessary to describe all the events of the siege. Brown held  out as long as he could, but was finally compelled to surrender. On the  5th of June, 1781, Brown, with three hundred men, marched out of Fort  Cornwallis, and that stronghold was immediately taken possession of by  Captain Rudolph. A strong guard was detailed by the American commanders,  to protect Brown from the just anger of the Georgia soldiers, under  Clarke, Williamson, and Jackson. To insure his safety, he was carried  to the quarters of \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee. The next day he and a few of  his officers were paroled and sent down the river in charge of a party  of infantry instructed to guard him. Ramsay, in his \"History of the  Revolution of South Carolina,\" says that Brown was recognized at Silver  Bluff by Mrs. McKay, who thus addressed him: \"Colonel Brown, in the late  day of your prosperity I visited your camp, and on my knees supplicated  for the life of my son; but you were deaf to my entreaties. You hanged  him, though a beardless youth, before my face. These eyes have seen him  scalped by the savages under your immediate command, and for no better  reason than that his name was McKay. As you are now prisoner to the  leaders of my country, for the present I lay aside all thoughts of  revenge; but when you resume your sword, I will go five hundred miles to  demand satisfaction at the point of it, for the murder of my son.\" The  probability is that Mrs. McKay used no such stately language. No doubt  she walked up to Brown, shook her finger in his face, and exclaimed,  \"You miserable villain! I can't get at you now; but if the day ever  comes, I'll flay you alive for the murder of my poor boy.\"    The fall of Augusta was received with rejoicings by the patriots  everywhere, and the British and the Tories were correspondingly  depressed. Men who had been overawed by the cruelty of the Tories, now  came out boldly for the cause of independence, and the forces of the  Americans were rapidly strengthened. Preparations were made for an  aggressive campaign in Georgia by the Liberty Boys; and in this purpose  they had the active aid and sympathy of General Greene, whose skill and  ability as a commander were not greater than the wisdom he displayed in  dealing with the people.    In January, 1782, General Greene ordered General Anthony Wayne to take  charge of the campaign in Georgia. At the same time he wrote a letter  to Governor Martin that displays better than any document now extant  the sagacity and conservatism that were the basis of General Greene's  character and the source of his great success as a commander. \"I cannot  help recommending to your Excellency,\" he wrote to the governor of  Georgia, \"to open a door for the disaffected in your State to come  in, with particular exceptions. It is better to save than to destroy,  especially when we are obliged to expose good men to destroy bad. It  is always dangerous to push people to a state of desperation; and the  satisfaction of revenge has but a momentary existence, and is commonly  succeeded by pity and remorse. The practice of plundering, which, I am  told, has been too much indulged with you, is very destructive to the  morals and manners of the people. Habits and dispositions founded  on this practice soon grow obstinate, and are difficult to restrain;  indeed, it is the most direct way of undermining all government, and,  never fails to bring the laws into contempt, for people will not stop at  the barriers which were first intended to bound them after having tasted  the sweets of possessing property by the easy mode of plunder. The  preservation of morals and an encouragement to honest industry should be  the first objects of government. Plundering is the destruction of both.  I wish the cause of liberty may never be tarnished with inhumanity, nor  the morals of people bartered in exchange for wealth.\" This letter was  intended to put an end to the war of extermination that the Tories of  Upper Georgia had begun, and to prevent the patriots from carrying out  their plans of revenge. The letter did great good. It was turned over  to the Legislature by the governor, and thus made public; and its  sentiments were taken to heart by hundreds who had suffered the most  cruel wrongs at the hands of the Tories. General Greene's letter was  also made the basis of two proclamations, both issued by the governor  after conference with General Wayne. One opened the door to disaffected  Georgians who might desire to return to the ranks of the republicans,  and the other was addressed to the Hessian troops who had already  begun to sympathize with the Salzburghers at Ebenezer. Stevens, in his  \"History of Georgia,\" says that many citizens who had been compelled  from various reasons to seek protection under the British Government,  and who had even joined the armies of the enemy, took advantage of the  proclamation which referred to them, returned to their State allegiance,  and joined the forces of General Wayne, where they proved their  sincerity by making the most zealous efforts to merit the pardon and  protection that had been promised them by the governor.    After a brilliant campaign, lasting from January to July, 1782, General  Wayne, assisted by Elijah Clarke, James Jackson, and other bold spirits  who had never suffered the fires of liberty to go out in Georgia,  cleared the State of the British. Savannah was occupied on the 11th of  July, the keys having been surrendered to James Jackson. This was the  end of British rule in Georgia.          A NEGRO PATRIOT.    [Illustration: A Negro Patriot 122]    Along with the emigrants from North Carolina who first settled Wilkes  County, there came a man named Aycock. He brought with him a mulatto boy  named Austin. This boy passed as Aycock's slave; but when the conflict  between the Liberty Boys and the Tories in that part of the country  became desperate,--when the patriots were fighting for their lives as  well as for the liberties of their country,--Aycock's neighbors called  on him to do his part. According to all accounts, Aycock was not much  of a warrior. His sympathies were with his liberty-loving neighbors;  but his enthusiasm did not invite him to expose himself to the fire of  musketry. It is said that he joined the neighbors, and strove to be a  faithful militiaman, but he was in a state of constant fear. Governor  Gilmer says of Aycock, that, from the time he was required to fight, he  saw a terrible Tory constantly pointing a loaded gun at him. His alarm  finally became so extreme that he offered as his substitute the mulatto  boy Austin, who had then grown to be a stout and serviceable lad.    Objection was made that Austin was a slave, and could not therefore be  received as a soldier. At this, Aycock acknowledged that Austin was no  slave; that, although he was a mulatto, he had been born free. This fact  was made so clear to the patriots, that they willingly received Austin  as a soldier, and he was mustered into the service under the name of  Austin Dabney. He fought under Elijah Clarke, being under the command of  Colonel John Dooly, who was afterwards so foully murdered by the Tories.  Of all the brave men that fought under the heroic Clarke, there was none  braver than Austin Dabney, none that did better service.    He was in the battle of Kettle Creek, and was foremost among those who  followed Clarke. Toward the close of this the bloodiest battle fought in  Georgia between the patriots and Tories, Austin Dabney was shot through  the thigh, and so dangerously wounded that he became a cripple for life.  He was taken by his comrades to the house of a Mr. Harris, where he was  carefully nursed until his wound healed. He was not able to do military  duty after that, but he devoted himself to Harris and his family more  faithfully than any slave could have done. It may be said of him that  gratitude became the ruling passion of his heart.    After the Americans had won their independence, and peace with it,  Austin Dabney became prosperous. Being a quick-witted man, with an  instinct for business, he accumulated property. He finally moved to  Madison County, taking with him his benefactor and family, to whose  wants and desires he continued to minister with as much devotion as he  displayed at the beginning of his service. It was in Madison County  that Austin Dabney became noted for his fondness for horse-racing. He  attended all the races in the neighboring counties. He was the owner of  some of the finest race horses to be found in the country; and such was  his popularity, that he always found prominent men to stand for him.    Shortly after he removed to Madison County, he received a pension from  the United States Government. He sent Harris's oldest son to school,  and afterwards to college. When the young man graduated from Franklin  College, now the State University, Austin Dabney supported him while  he studied law with Hon. Stephen Upson at Lexington, Oglethorpe County.  When young Harris was undergoing his examination for admission to the  bar, Austin Dabney stood leaning against the railing that inclosed the  court, listening to the proceedings with great anxiety. When the young  man was sworn in, and was shaking hands with the members of the bar,  Austin, unable to control himself, burst into a flood of tears, happy  that he had been able to make a gentleman of the son of the man who had  nursed him so long and patiently while his wound was healing.    When the public lands in Georgia were distributed among the people by  lottery, the Legislature gave to Austin Dabney a lot of land in Walton  County. The next year the voters"]]]
