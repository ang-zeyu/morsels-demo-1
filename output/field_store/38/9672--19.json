Those who would bear transportation were taken away, the others left  where they were. By the third day our patients seemed strong enough that  we might risk giving them food as solid as rice, and the great kettles  were filled with that, cooked soft, mixed with condensed and malted  milk. The number of wounded grew less day by day, and better care could  be taken of them.    At Siboney, the great needs of the hour were met by the little band of  surgeons and nurses, working night and day. The following is from a  letter in the Times-Herald, now Record-Herald, of Chicago, by Miss Janet  Jennings, who volunteered her service in the hospital. One gets from  this simple, direct picture, a better appreciation of that heroism which  lives after excitement, which survives the rush and shouting of assault,  which is sustained without comradeship:      \"SIBONEY, _July 8, 1898_.    \"Above hospital tents Red Cross flags are flying, and here is the real  life--the suffering and heroism. Everybody who can do even so little as  carry a cup of water lends willing hands to help the wounded. Most of  the wounded are from the first day's engagement, when the infantry was  ordered to lead the attack on Santiago, instead of using the artillery.    \"And it all came at once--a quick blow--with little or no preparation  to meet it. I mentioned in a former letter the lack of preparation on  the part of the army to care for the sick. There was then almost  nothing--no cots, bedding or proper food, for less than one hundred sick  men.    \"Two days later, when the wounded came in, the needs of the hour were  overwhelming. The situation can not be described. Thousands of our men  had been hurried to the front to fight. It was well understood that it  would be a hard fight. The dead would need only burial, but the wounded  would need care. And yet, with the exception of a limited number of  stretchers, a medicine-chest and a few bandages, no preparation had been  made--neither cots nor food--practically no hospital supplies.    \"It is not strange that surgeons were desperate and nurses distressed.  The force of each was wholly inadequate. The exact number of wounded may  never be known. But the estimate at this time is about 1,000  wounded--some 1,500 killed and wounded.    \"Wounded men who made their way down on foot eight miles over the rough,  hilly road will never know just how their strength held out. Others were  brought down in army wagons by the load, as few ambulances were at  hand. Fortunately, there were some tents here that had been used by  troops before going to the front. Under these hay was spread and covered  with blankets, and the improvised hospital was ready. One tent was taken  for operating-tables, and the work of surgeons and nurses began. They  worked night and day for forty-eight hours, with only brief intervals  for coffee and hard-tack.    \"Wounded men had to wait for hours before bullets could be extracted and  wounds dressed. But there was no word of complaint--only silent, patient  suffering, borne with a courage that was sublime. As the wounded  continued to come in, tent-room gave out, and hay with blankets were  placed outside, and to these 'beds' the less severely wounded were  assigned. It was evident that the medical department of the army had  failed absolutely to send hospital supplies, or by this time they would  have been landed. As it was, the surgeons turned to the Red Cross ship  'State of Texas' for help, and the supplies originally intended for the  starving Cubans were sent ashore for our wounded.    \"Miss Barton had been urged and advised to wait until the army opened  and made the way safe to land supplies for reconcentrados and refugees.  But she had foreseen the situation to a certain degree and followed the  army as quickly as possible--to wait for the emergency, rather than have  the emergency wait for her. The 'State of Texas' was here a week before  the attack on Santiago.    \"While surgeons and nurses were probing for bullets and dressing wounds,  a force of men on the Red Cross ship worked half the night getting out  cots and blankets, food and bandages, and at daylight next morning the  supplies were landed, taking advantage of the smooth sea between four  and nine o'clock, as later in the day the high surf makes it extremely  difficult for landings. There were six tables in the operating-tent and  eight surgeons. In twenty-four hours the surgeons had operated upon and  dressed the wounds of 475 men. Four Red Cross sisters, trained nurses,  assisted the surgeons. They were Sister Bettina, wife of Dr. Lesser,  surgeon-in-chief of the Red Cross; Sister Minna, Sister Isabel, and  Sister Blanche. Their knowledge of surgery, skill, and nerve were a  revelation to the army surgeons. These young women, all under thirty,  went from one operating-table to another, and, whatever was the nature  of the wound or complication, proved equal to the emergency.    \"In the Red Cross Hospital, across the way, Sister Anna was in charge  of the sick men, turned over to the Red Cross two days before, when army  surgeons with troops were all ordered to the front. With 475 wounded men  to feed there was not a camp-kettle to be found in which gruel could be  prepared, coffee made or anything cooked, not a kettle of any sort to be  furnished by the army. The whole camp outfit at Tampa in the way of  cooking utensils must have been left behind.    \"But there was an overruling Providence when the 'State of Texas' was  loaded for Cuba. So far everything needed has been found in the hold of  this old ship, which deserves to have and will have a credit page in the  history of the war in Cuba. There were kettles, charcoal braziers, and  cooking utensils carried over to the Red Cross Hospital. To prepare  gruel, rice, coffee, and various other proper and palatable dishes for  forty or fifty sick men by the slow process of a charcoal brazier,  tea-kettle, and boiler is by no means easy cooking. But to prepare food  for 475 wounded men, some of whom had had nothing to eat for twenty-four  hours, cooking over a little charcoal pot is something that one must  take a 'hand in' to fully appreciate.    \"There was the feeling as if one were dazed and unnatural to hear  American soldiers, men from comfortable homes, literally begging for  'just a spoonful of gruel.' The charcoal pot burned night and day,  gallons of gruel were made and quantities of rice cooked until the  greatest stress had passed. It was no time to stand on trained service,  and everybody, man or woman, was ready to lend a hand.    \"A striking feature of the first day's engagement was the number of men  wounded in the head, arm, and upper part of the body. Some of these  cases, the most serious, were taken into the Red Cross Hospital, where  they received the most skilful and gentle nursing.    \"Two days' steady strain began to show on the Sisters.    \"The strain had been the greater because there were no facilities for  anything like a regular meal short of the ship, reached by a long, hard  tramp in the sand, then a row over the tossing waves. But nobody thought  of meals. The one thing was to feed and nurse the 500 wounded and sick  men. Human endurance, however, has its limit, and unless the Sisters  could get a little rest they would give out. I went on duty for  twenty-four hours, at night, with the assistance of one man, taking care  of forty patients, fever, measles, and dysentery cases, and half a dozen  badly wounded men. Among the latter was Captain Mills, of the First  Cavalry, and William Clark, a colored private in the Twenty-fifth  Infantry, regulars. They were brought over from the hospital tents and  placed on cots out on the little porch, where there was just room to  pass between the cots.    \"Their wounds were very similar--in the head--and of such a character as  to require cool applications to the eyes constantly. Ice was scarce and  worth its weight in gold, for the lives of these men as well as others  depended chiefly on cool applications to the eyes, with as uniform  temperature as possible. We had one small piece of ice, carefully  wrapped in a blanket. There never was a small piece of ice that went so  far. If I were to tell the truth about it nobody would believe me.    \"Never in my whole life, I think, have I wished for anything so much as  I wished for plenty of ice that night. It was applied by chipping in  small bits, laid in thin, dry cotton cloth, folded over in just the  right size and flat, to place across the eyes and forehead, enough of it  to be cold, but not heavy, on the wounds.    \"The ears of the sick are strangely acute. Whenever the sick men heard  the sound of chipping ice they begged for ice-water; even the smallest  bit of ice in a cup of water was begged with an eagerness that was  pitiful. I felt conscience-smitten. But it was a question of saving the  eyes of the wounded men, and there was no other way. To make the ice  last till morning I stealthily chipped it off so the sick men would not  hear the sound.    \"At midnight a surgeon came over from his tent ward with a little piece  of ice not larger than his hand. I do not know his name, but it does not  matter, it is inscribed above. 'This is all we can spare,' he said.  'Take it. You must keep those wounds cool at all hazards. I have another  case very like these--a man wounded in the head. I want to bring him  over here, where he will be sure of exactly the same nursing. His life  depends on the care he gets in the next twenty-four hours. Have you a  vacant cot?'    \"There was not a vacant cot, but we could make room for one on the porch  if he could find the cot. He thought he could, and went back, taking the  precious piece of ice that he really needed more than we did. In the  course of a half hour the surgeon returned to say it was impossible to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30249"],[0,"Ways of Nature (#16)"],[1,"the one sheep from the cattle, or to  frighten them all into breaking their necks in trying to escape him.  But neither result did he achieve. In the Yellowstone Park, President  Roosevelt and Major Pitcher saw a golden eagle trying the same tactics  upon a herd of elk that contained one yearling. The eagle doubtless  had his eye upon the yearling, though he would probably have been  quite satisfied to have driven one of the older ones down a precipice.  His chances of a dinner would have been equally good.    There is one particular in which the bird families are much more human  than our four-footed kindred. I refer to the practice of courtship.  The male of all birds, so far as I know, pays suit to the female and  seeks to please and attract her.[2] This the quadrupeds do not do;  there is no period of courtship among them, and no mating or pairing  as among the birds. The male fights for the female, but he does not  seek to win her by delicate attentions. If there are any exceptions to  this rule, I do not know them. There seems to be among the birds  something that is like what is called romantic love. The choice of  mate seems always to rest with the female,[2] while among the mammals  the female shows no preference at all.        [2] Except in the case of certain birds of India and Australia.    Among our own birds, the prettiest thing I know of attending the  period of courtship, or preliminary to the match-making, is the spring  musical festival and reunion of the goldfinches, which often lasts for  days, through rain and shine. In April or May, apparently all the  goldfinches from a large area collect in the top of an elm or a maple  and unite in a prolonged musical festival. Is it a contest among the  males for the favor of the females, or is it the spontaneous  expression of the gladness of the whole clan at the return of the  season of life and love? The birds seem to pair soon after, and  doubtless the concert of voices has some reference to that event.    There is one other human practice often attributed to the lower  animals that I must briefly consider, and that is the practice, under  certain circumstances, of poisoning their young. One often hears of  caged young birds being fed by their parents for a few days and then  poisoned; or of a mother fox poisoning her captive young when she  finds that she cannot liberate him; and such stories obtain ready  credence with the public, especially with the young. To make these  stories credible, one must suppose a school of pharmacy, too, in the  woods.    \"The worst thing about these poisoning stories,\" writes a friend of  mine, himself a writer of nature-books, \"is the implied appreciation  of the full effect and object of poison--the comprehension by the fox,  for instance, that the poisoned meat she may be supposed to find was  placed there for the object of killing herself (or some other fox),  and that she may apply it to another animal for that purpose.  Furthermore, that she understands the nature of death--that it brings  'surcease of sorrow,' and that death is better than captivity for her  young one. How did she acquire all this knowledge? Where was her  experience of its supposed truth obtained? How could she make so fine  and far-seeing a judgment, wholly out of the range of brute affairs,  and so purely philosophical and humanly ethical? It violates every  instinct and canon of natural law, which is for the preservation of  life at all hazards. This is simply the human idea of 'murder.'  Animals kill one another for food, or in rivalry, or in blind ferocity  of predatory disposition; but there is not a particle of evidence that  they 'commit murder' for ulterior ends. It is questionable whether  they comprehend the condition called death, or its nature, in any  proper sense.\"    On another occasion I laughed at a recent nature writer for his  credulity in half-believing the story told him by a fisherman, that  the fox catches crabs by using his tail as a bait; and yet I read in  Romanes that Olaus, in his account of Norway, says he has seen a fox  do this very thing among the rocks on the sea-coast.[3] One would like  to cross-question Olaus before accepting such a statement. One would  as soon expect a fox to put his brush in the fire as in the water.  When it becomes wet and bedraggled, he is greatly handicapped as to  speed. There is no doubt that rats will put their tails into jars that  contain liquid food they want, and then lick them off, as Romanes  proved; but the rat's tail is not a brush, nor in any sense an  ornament. Think what the fox-and-crab story implies! Now the fox is  entirely a land animal, and lives by preying upon land creatures,  which it follows by scent or sight. It can neither see nor smell crabs  in the deep water, where crabs are usually found. How should it know  that there are such things as crabs? How should it know that they can  be taken with bait and line or by fishing for them? When and how did  it get this experience? This knowledge belongs to man alone. It comes  through a process of reasoning that he alone is capable of. Man alone  of land animals sets traps and fishes. There is a fish called the  angler (_Lophius piscatorius_), which, it is said on doubtful  authority, by means of some sort of appendages on its head angles for  small fish; but no competent observer has reported any land animal  doing so. Again, would a crab lay hold of a mass of fur like a fox's  tail?--even if the tail could be thrust deep enough into the water,  which is impossible. Crabs, when not caught with hand-nets, are  usually taken in water eight or ten feet deep. They are baited and  caught with a piece of meat tied to a string, but cannot be lifted to  the surface till they are eating the meat, and then a dip-net is  required to secure them. The story, on the whole, is one of the most  preposterous that ever gained credence in natural history.        [3] A book published in London in 1783, entitled _A      Geographical, Historical, and Commercial Grammar and the      Present State of the Several Kingdoms of the World_, among      other astonishing natural history notes, makes this statement      about the white and red fox of Norway: \"They have a      particular way of drawing crabs ashore by dipping their tails      in the water, which the crab lays hold of.\"    Good observers are probably about as rare as good poets. Accurate  seeing,--an eye that takes in the whole truth, and nothing but the  truth,--how rare indeed it is! So few persons know or can tell  exactly what they see; so few persons can draw a right inference from  an observed fact; so few persons can keep from reading their own  thoughts and preconceptions into what they see; only a person with the  scientific habit of mind can be trusted to report things as they are.  Most of us, in observing the wild life about us, see more or see less  than the truth. We see less when our minds are dull, or preoccupied,  or blunted by want of interest. This is true of most country people.  We see more when we read the lives of the wild creatures about us in  the light of our human experience, and impute to the birds and beasts  human motives and methods. This is too often true of the eager city  man or woman who sallies out into the country to study nature.    The tendency to sentimentalize nature has, in our time, largely taken  the place of the old tendency to demonize and spiritize it. It is  anthropomorphism in another form, less fraught with evil to us, but  equally in the way of a clear understanding of the life about us.                                            VII                                 DEVIOUS PATHS      There is no better type or epitome of wild nature than the  bird's-nest--something built, and yet as if it grew, a part of the  ground, or of the rock, or of the branch upon which it is placed;  beginning so coarsely, so irregularly, and ending so finely and  symmetrically; so unlike the work of hands, and yet the result of a  skill beyond hands; and when it holds its complement of eggs, how  pleasing, how suggestive!    The bird adapts means to an end, and yet so differently from the way  of man,--an end of which it does not know the value or the purpose. We  know it is prompted to it by the instinct of reproduction. When the  woodpecker in the fall excavates a lodge in a dry limb, we know he is  prompted to it by the instinct of self-preservation, but the birds  themselves obey the behests of nature without knowledge.    A bird's-nest suggests design, and yet it seems almost haphazard; the  result of a kind of madness, yet with method in it. The hole the  woodpecker drills for its cell is to the eye a perfect circle, and  the rim of most nests is as true as that of a cup. The circle and the  sphere exist in nature; they are mother forms and hold all other  forms. They are easily attained; they are spontaneous and inevitable.  The bird models her nest about her own breast; she turns round and  round in it, and its circular character results as a matter of course.  Angles, right lines, measured precision, so characteristic of the  works of man, are rarely met with in organic nature.    Nature reaches her ends by devious paths; she loiters, she meanders,  she plays by the way; she surely \"arrives,\" but it is always in a  blind, hesitating, experimental kind of fashion. Follow the tunnels of  the ants or the crickets, or of the moles and the weasels,  underground, or the courses of the streams or the paths of the animals  above ground--how they turn and hesitate, how wayward and undecided  they are! A right line seems out of the question.    The oriole often weaves strings into her nest; sometimes she binds and  overhands the part of the rim where she alights in going in, to make  it stronger, but it is always done in a hit-or-miss, childish sort of  way, as one would expect it to be; the strings are massed, or snarled,  or left dangling at"]]]
