[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#16)"],[1,"the fighting, and which we cannot afford to  disregard, is the conative aspect of the behaviour of the owner of the  territory. The bird attacks with apparent deliberation _as if_ it were  striving to attain some definite end. I recollect an incident which was  interesting from this point of view. A pair of Reed-Buntings were  disturbed by a Weasel which had approached their nest containing young.  Both birds betrayed symptoms of excitement; as the Weasel threaded its  way amongst the rushes, so they fluttered from clump to clump or clung  to the stems, uttering a note which is peculiar to times of distress,  and followed it thus until finally it disappeared in a hedge. The  rapidly uttered note and the excitement of the birds caused some  commotion, and the male from an adjoining territory approached the  scene. Now one would have expected that the presence of this bird, and  possibly its aid in driving away a common enemy, would have been  welcomed; one would have thought that all else would have been  subservient to the common danger, and that so real a menace to the  offspring would have evoked an impulse in the parent powerful enough to  dominate the situation and subordinate all the activities of the bird to  the attainment of its end. But what happened? Three times during this  incident, the male, whose young were in danger, abandoned the pursuit of  the Weasel and pursued the intruder. It was not merely that he objected  to the presence of this neighbouring male in a passive way, nor even  that he had a momentary skirmish with it, but that he determinedly drove  the intruder beyond the boundary and only then returned to harass the  Weasel.    Thus it seems clear that the proximate end to which the fighting is  directed is not necessarily the defeat of the intruder, but its removal  from a certain position. And inasmuch as this result will be obtained  whether the retreat is brought about by fear of an opponent or by  physical exhaustion, it is manifest that too much significance need not  be attached to the amount of injury inflicted. It is necessary to bear  this in mind, because it is held by some, who have carefully observed  the actions of various species, that overmuch importance is attached to  the conflicts, that in a large number of instances they are mere  \"bickerings\" and lead to nothing, and that they are now only \"formal,\"  which means, I suppose, that they are vestigial--fragments of warfare  that determined the survival of the species in bygone ages. But if the  conclusion at which we have just arrived be correct, if we can recognise  a single aim passing through the whole of the warfare--and that one the  removal of an intruder from a certain position, then we need no longer  concern ourselves as to the degree of severity of the battles--we see it  all in true perspective. Neither exhaustion nor physical inability are  the sole factors which determine the nature and extent of the fighting;  there is a more important factor still--position. According, that is to  say, to the position which a bird occupies whilst fighting is in  progress, so its pugnacious nature gains or loses susceptibility, and it  is this gain or loss of susceptibility which I refer to when I speak of  the fighting as being controlled.    What we have then to consider is the relation of \"susceptibility\" to  \"position.\" We can explain the relationship in two ways. We can say that  the part of the nature of the male which leads to the occupation of a  territory, and is partly hereditary and partly acquired, is stronger  than the part which leads the bird to fight, and which is conditioned by  the presence of a female, and that consequently when the male passes the  boundary, the impulse to return asserts itself and the conflict ceases;  or we can say that the occupation of a territory is the condition under  which the pugnacious instinct is rendered susceptible to stimulation,  that the stimulus is supplied by the intruder, and that when the male  passes outside the accustomed area its instinct is no longer so  susceptible and it therefore retires from the conflict.    [Illustration: Long-tailed Tit Males fighting for possession of  territory. The feathers have been torn from the crown of the defeated  and dying rival.    Emery Walker ph.sc.]    Of these explanations, the first is not altogether satisfactory. It  requires the presence of a female and, as we have seen, a female is by  no means always present. Then it attributes to the one side of the  inherited nature an influence which is not borne out by the facts, for  in the ordinary routine of existence, without the incentive of battle,  every individual is liable to wander occasionally beyond its boundary  and to intrude temporarily upon its neighbours; and this it could  scarcely do, providing its nature to remain within the territory were  powerful enough to dominate its movements and curtail its activities  even during the excitement of an encounter. But there is nothing  inherently improbable in the alternative hypothesis, nor anything that  is at all inconsistent with the behaviour as observed; on the contrary,  if it is admitted, the facts become connected together and exhibit a  meaning which they otherwise would not have possessed.    So much for the controlling influence of \"position,\" which alone seems  to me sufficient ground for believing that the fighting has reference to  the territory. But it is not the whole of the evidence.    Now if it were possible to demonstrate by actual observation that those  males which had not established territories were not pugnacious, we  should have something in the nature of proof of the correctness of this  view. Demonstrative evidence of this kind is, however, unattainable. Yet  we can come very near to obtaining it by reason of a peculiar feature  which marks the process of acquiring territory--the neutral ground. The  Lapwing will serve as an illustration. In the previous chapter I  referred to the small flocks that appeared in the accustomed water  meadow early in February, and I described how they settled day after day  in that meadow, but only in a limited part of it, where they passed  their time in rest, in preening their feathers, or in running this way  and that lazily searching for food; and how, at length, the flock  dwindled by reason of individuals breaking away in order to secure  positions on the remaining part of the meadow. Here the neutral ground  is adjacent to the territories, and, while still occupied by the flock,  is resorted to by the males that had deserted that flock in order to  establish those territories.    Suppose now that we have the whole meadow in view from some point of  vantage. In front of us are the territories, in the distance the neutral  ground; and in each territory there is a solitary male, while on the  neutral ground a number of individuals of both sexes are assembled, and  move about freely one amongst another. So that the scene presented to  view is somewhat as follows: a flat meadow, at one end of which, and at  fairly regular intervals, a few solitary individuals are dotted about,  each one keeping at a distance from its neighbours; while at the other  end a number of individuals are collected together in a comparatively  small space, apparently deriving some satisfaction from their close  association. That surely is a very remarkable contrast. But let us  continue our investigation, first fixing our attention upon the solitary  individuals; one is standing preening its feathers, another is squatting  upon the ground, a third runs a few yards in this direction then a few  yards in that, stimulated apparently by the sight of food, and so on.  Moreover, each one keeps strictly to a well-defined area and makes no  attempt to associate with its fellows. One of the males, however, whilst  roaming backwards and forwards approaches the limit of its territory,  and this brings the neighbouring bird, whose boundary is threatened,  rapidly to the spot. In an upright position both stand face to face, and  the battle then begins; with their wings they attempt to beat one  another about the body, with their beaks they aim blows at the head, and  in the melee wings and legs seem to be inextricably mixed; whilst at  intervals, driven backwards by the force of the collision, they are  compelled to separate, only, however, to return to the charge--and the  sound of beating wings and the feathers that float in the air are tokens  of earnestness. Such scenes are of frequent occurrence; but the  conflicts vary in intensity, and the circumstances under which they  occur vary too, and females come and go without leaving any clue as to  their ultimate intentions.    Turning now to the flock one is impressed with the friendship that seems  to exist between the various members. There are, it is true, occasional  displays of pugnacity which never seem to develop into anything very  serious; for instance, one bird will fly at another, and a momentary  scuffle is followed by a short pursuit but nothing more--nothing, that  is to say, in the least comparable with the battle previously described.  Of what is the flock composed? Of members of both sexes. There is no  difficulty in assuring oneself that this is so. But is it entirely  composed of individuals in whom development has not reached a stage  adequate for the functioning of the primary dispositions? No, not  entirely; for it will be observed that its number is a fluctuating one,  that birds come and go, and, if a close watch is kept upon the different  individuals as they leave, it will be noticed that some at least are  inmates of the territories at the opposite end of the meadow--the  solitary members whose behaviour we were recently watching. This fact is  an important one. We were impressed, it may be remembered, with the  contrast between the general behaviour of the birds at the opposite  ends of the meadow. But now it appears as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#16)"],[1," effectively. And how many there  are similar to that!    \"I do not see how boys could work at all in ordinary parish choirs, for  here there are not the opportunities of teaching boys to read well at  sight. It is only by daily practice that one can make anything of boys.    \"Yours faithfully,  \"H. KEETON.\"    Dr. Frank Bates, organist of Norwich Cathedral, has favoured me with a  copy of a paper on the boy's voice, in which he says:--    \"The compass of a boy's voice when properly developed is from    [Illustration: C to A B[b] or C]    The chest or lower register extends from    [Illustration: C to C or D]    The head or upper register extends from    [Illustration: C or D to B[b] or C]    No fixed compass can possibly be given to the different registers, as  the older a boy becomes the lower the change occurs; the head register  often being used as low down as A.\"    [Illustration: musical notation]    In a letter to me Dr. Bates says:--    \"I quite think that, for ordinary parish church services, the effect of  boy altos, if properly taught, is all that one can desire.\"    In reply to my remark that the break comes in so awkwardly for boy  altos, Dr. Bates says:--    \"I fail to understand the reason you quote for the non-usage of boy  altos. There is no change whatever in a boy's voice, _in its normal  state_, until [Illustration: musical notation] is reached. If the change  is made lower down all the brilliancy is taken out of a boy's voice. As  a boy gets older he uses the upper register much lower down. I have  known boys at the age of eighteen with lovely top notes but very poor  chest register. In such cases, when a boy's top register commences at  [Illustration: G] I can quite understand the difficulty.\"    There is evidently some conflict of nomenclature here, as the limits of  the registers as given by Dr. Bates differ considerably from those which  are usual. I am glad to learn that Dr. Bates is writing a book on \"The  Voices of Boys,\" which will no doubt clear up the subject. In the paper  before me he recommends practice of the scales to such syllables as La,  Fa, Ta, Pa, in order to bring the tone well to the front of the mouth,  and reinforce it by means of the soft upper palate. He recommends the  teacher to train the boys to use the upper register by making them sing  over and over again, _very softly_, the following notes:--    [Illustration: Chest Head Ah....]    Here again the transition seems to me to be taken much too high.    Mr. Frank Sharp, of Dundee, trainer of the celebrated children's choir,  which has sung the treble and alto parts, both solos and choruses, of  _Messiah, St. Paul_, and many cantatas, writes to me:--    \"In part-singing where there are boy trebles, the adult male alto voice  has its charms. The contrast in quality between the open tone of the  boys' voices and the condensed, sometimes squeaky sweetness of the man  alto does not affect the blending, and helps the distinctness of parts.  Considering the growing scarcity of this latter voice, why not use boy  altos? They can be made as effective as ordinary women altos, but they  are as short-lived and need more attention than the boy trebles. Their  chief drawback is a tendency to produce tone without the least attention  to quality or effect save that of noise. Nevertheless, there is nothing  to hinder boy altos doing all that is necessary, or, indeed, all that  can be done by the adult male alto. I have trained boys to sing alto in  _Messiah_, _St. Paul_, and equally trying music, during the past twenty  years, and anyone else who keeps the girl's alto voice before him as a  model can do the same. The boy alto voice may be said to have a husk and  a kernel: the one strident, harsh, and overpowering; the other sweet,  and, with use, rich and round. The average healthy boy, with his  exuberant love of noise, will naturally give the husk, but the skilful  voice-trainer will only accept the kernel, evolved from right register,  good _timbre_, and proper production. Seeing and hearing a process in  voice-training is, however, more satisfactory than much writing and the  reading thereof.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. W. W. Pearson, master of a village school in Norfolk, who is  well-known by his excellent part-songs, writes to me:--    \"I succeed very well in getting boys to sing alto because I always use a  large number of exercises in two parts, making each division of the  class in turn take the lower part. I do not choose boys for altos on  account of age. That, in my opinion, has nothing to do with it. I choose  them by quality of voice. There is no break in the voice of the natural  alto between]--[Illustration: G and C] I find altos out generally when  they are novices, by hearing them trying to sing with the others, and  dropping down an octave in high passages.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The following interesting notes are by Mr. W. Critchley, organist,  choirmaster, and schoolmaster in the village of Hurst, near Reading:--    \"I do not choose the elder boys as altos, as I find that treble boys, as  a rule, are at their very best just before the change of voice. And  moreover, when that change begins, the voice is so uncertain in its  intonation that if the boy were put to sing alto he would be certain to  drag the others down. At present I have one or two boys with round,  mellow voices, who are very effective. Unfortunately, most of the alto  parts in hymn-tunes and chants hover about the place where the break in  the voice occurs, and it requires a lot of practice to conquer the  difficulty. As a rule, I get the alto boys to sing in the lower  register. It is very seldom they get a note which they cannot take in  this register, so I train it up a little, thus--    [Illustration: KEYS B to F[#].    d_1 t_2 l_2 t_2 d_1 r_1 m_1]    I do not see any other way of getting over the uncertainty in the boy  alto voice. It is merely a matter of time and trouble.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. J. C. E. Taylor, choirmaster of St. Mary's, Penzance, and  head-master of the National School, says:--    \"I have had one or two pure alto voices, and these are the best, but  very rare. Good voices of trebles unable to take [Illustration: musical  notation] (D) have often become fair alto voices, and my present solo  alto boy is one of these. The trios in the anthems are taken by boy  alto, tenor, and bass. These alto boys are practised from lower G to  C--[Illustration: musical notation] up and down, minding their _p's_ and  _f's_. My trebles, as a rule, last until fifteen years of age, and altos  until sixteen, and even seventeen.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. A. Isaac, choirmaster of a church in Liverpool, says:--    \"For the last twenty years I have been continuously engaged with male  voice choirs in connection with churches too poor to pay for adult help,  and, as you may readily guess, I have never yet had the good fortune to  secure, for any length, the services of gentlemen who could sing  falsetto effectively. I have had, therefore, to rely solely upon my boys  for the alto part. At the present time my choir, which is allowed to be  up to the mark amongst local Liverpool churches, is made up of 22 boys  (18 treble and 4 alto) paid, and 14 adults (5 tenors and 9 basses)  voluntary. There is, I find, no royal road to the alto part. My course  is as follows. I obtain my boys as soon as they are eleven, by which age  they have been made fairly familiar at my school with the old notation  on the movable _do_ plan. Theoretical instruction is continued side by  side with special voice-training exercises. Occasionally I meet with a  boy who has a true mezzo-soprano voice, and he is a treasure, but in the  main my selections are boys with treble voices. As soon as a treble  shows signs of voice breaking, I let him down into the alto part. The  transition is not very difficult, for by this time the boy has become a  fairly good Sol-faist and reader. I have but to adapt the voice-training  exercises to him in company with his fellows, and I have no reason to  regret the issue. I take my boys always together, with two-part  exercises.\"    Mr. Stocks Hammond, organist and choirmaster of St. Barnabas, Bradford,  in a published paper on \"Boys' Voices,\" says:--    \"During many years of choir training, I have experienced very great  difficulty in supplying the alto parts with _good_ men's falsetto voices  (especially in voluntary choirs), and I have therefore been compelled to  have that part sung by boys, and experience leads me to prefer the boys'  voices to men's, unless, indeed, they are real alto voices, which are  seldom to be met with. I have never yet had any great difficulty in  finding boys' voices capable of sustaining that part, and can always  fill up any gaps that occur by the following means. Whenever I find a  treble begins to experience a difficulty in singing the upper notes, and  that in order to sing them he must strain his voice, immediately he is  put to sing alto, which he is in most cases able to do for one or two  years, and during that time he is thus retained as a useful member of  the choir; for otherwise he would very soon have been lost to it  entirely, for nothing hastens so much the breaking of the voice as the  habit of unduly straining it.\"    Mr. T. H. Collinson, Mus.B., organist of St. Mary's Cathedral,  Edinburgh, writes to me:--    \"Boy altos are a fraud and a deception, as a rule, though occasionally  one meets with a natural contralto at an early age. Even then he can  generally be worked up to treble by gentle treatment, developing the  middle and falsetto registers.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In order to get to the bottom of this subject, I invited correspondence  in the _Musical Standard_ (until recently the organ of the College of  Organists), and several interesting letters were the"]]]
