They don't  give steeplechase-riders a chance in Sydney. There's very few races, and  the big sweepstakes keep horses out of the game.\"    \"Do you get a fair share of the riding?\" I asked.    \"Oh, yes; I get as much as anybody. But there's a lot of 'em got a  notion I won't take hold of a horse when I'm told (i.e., pull him to  prevent him winning). Some of these days I'll take hold of a horse when  they don't expect it.\"    I smiled as I thought there was probably a sorry day in store for some  backer when the jockey \"took hold\" unexpectedly.    \"Do you have to pull horses, then, to get employment?\"    \"Oh, well, it's this way,\" he said, rather apologetically, \"if an owner  is badly treated by the handicapper, and is just giving his horse a run  to get weight off, then it's right enough to catch hold a bit. But when  a horse is favourite and the public are backing him it isn't right to  take hold of him then. _I_ would not do it.\" This was his whole code of  morals--not to pull a favourite; and he felt himself very superior to  the scoundrel who would pull favourites or outsiders indiscriminately.    \"What do you get for riding?\" I asked him.    \"Well,\" he said, looking about uneasily, \"we're supposed to get a  fiver for a losing mount and ten pounds if we win, but a lot of the  steeplechase-owners are what I call 'battlers'--men who have no money  and get along by owing everybody. They promise us all sorts of money if  we win, but they don't pay if we lose. I only got two pounds for that  last steeplechase.\"    \"Two pounds!\" I made a rapid calculation. He had ridden over eighteen  fences for two pounds--had chanced his life eighteen times at less than  half-a-crown a time.    \"Good Heavens!\" I said, \"that's a poor game. Wouldn't you be better back  on the station?\"    \"Oh, I don't know--sometimes we get laid a bit to nothing, and do well  out of a race. And then, you know, a steeplechase rider is somebody--not  like an ordinary fellow that is just working.\"    I realised that I was an \"ordinary fellow who was just working\", and  felt small accordingly.    \"I'm just off to weigh now,\" he said--\"I'm riding Contractor, and he'll  run well, but he always seems to fall at those logs. Still, I ought to  have luck to-day. I met a hearse as I was coming out. I'll get him over  the fences, somehow.\"    \"Do you think it lucky, then, to meet a hearse?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"if you _meet_ it. You mustn't overtake it--that's  unlucky. So is a cross-eyed man unlucky. Cross-eyed men ought to be kept  off racecourses.\"    He reappeared clad in his racing rig, and we set off to see the horse  saddled. We found the owner in a great state of excitement. It seemed he  had no money--absolutely none whatever--but had borrowed enough to pay  the sweepstakes, and stood to make something if the horse won and lose  nothing if he lost, as he had nothing to lose. My friend insisted on  being paid two pounds before he would mount, and the owner nearly had a  fit in his efforts to persuade him to ride on credit. At last a backer  of the horse agreed to pay 2 pounds 10s., win or lose, and the rider was  to get 25 pounds out of the prize if he won. So up he got; and as he and  the others walked the big muscular horses round the ring, nodding gaily  to friends in the crowd, I thought of the gladiators going out to fight  in the arena with the cry of \"Hail, Caesar, those about to die salute  thee!\"    The story of the race is soon told. My friend went to the front at the  start and led nearly all the way, and \"Contractor!\" was on every one's  lips as the big horse sailed along in front of his field. He came at the  log-fence full of running, and it looked certain that he would get over.  But at the last stride he seemed to falter, then plunged right into the  fence, striking it with his chest, and, turning right over, landed on  his unfortunate rider.    A crowd clustered round and hid horse and rider from view, and I ran  down to the casualty-room to meet him when the ambulance came in. The  limp form was carefully taken out and laid on a stretcher while a doctor  examined the crushed ribs, the broken arm, and all the havoc that the  horse's huge weight had wrought.    There was no hope from the first. My poor friend, who had so often faced  Death for two pounds, lay very still awhile. Then he began to talk,  wandering in his mind, \"Where are the cattle?\"--his mind evidently going  back to the old days on the road. Then, quickly, \"Look out there--give  me room!\" and again \"Five-and-twenty pounds, Mary, and a sure thing if  he don't fall at the logs.\"    Mary was sobbing beside the bed, cursing the fence and the money that  had brought him to grief. At last, in a tone of satisfaction, he said,  quite clear and loud: \"I know how it was--_There couldn't have been any  dead man in that hearse!_\"    And so, having solved the mystery to his own satisfaction, he drifted  away into unconsciousness--and woke somewhere on the other side of the  big fence that we can neither see through nor over, but all have to face  sooner or later.          VICTOR SECOND      We were training two horses for the Buckatowndown races--an old grey  warrior called Tricolor--better known to the station boys as The  Trickler--and a mare for the hack race. Station horses don't get trained  quite like Carbine; some days we had no time to give them gallops at  all, so they had to gallop twice as far the next day to make up.    One day the boy we had looking after The Trickler fell in with a mob of  sharps who told him we didn't know anything about training horses, and  that what the horse really wanted was \"a twicer\"--that is to say, a  gallop twice round the course. So the boy gave him \"a twicer\" on his own  responsibility. When we found out about it we gave the boy a twicer with  the strap, and he left and took out a summons against us. But somehow  or other we managed to get the old horse pretty fit, tried him against  hacks of different descriptions, and persuaded ourselves that we had the  biggest certainty ever known on a racecourse.    When the horses were galloping in the morning the kangaroo-dog, Victor,  nearly always went down to the course to run round with them. It amused  him, apparently, and didn't hurt anyone, so we used to let him race; in  fact, we rather encouraged him, because it kept him in good trim to hunt  kangaroo. When we were starting for the meeting, someone said we had  better tie up Victor or he would be getting stolen at the races. We  called and whistled, but he had made himself scarce, so we started and  forgot all about him.    Buckatowndown Races. Red-hot day, everything dusty, everybody drunk and  blasphemous. All the betting at Buckatowndown was double-event--you had  to win the money first, and fight the man for it afterwards.    The start for our race, the Town Plate, was delayed for a quarter of an  hour because the starter flatly refused to leave a fight of which he was  an interested spectator. Every horse, as he did his preliminary gallop,  had a string of dogs after him, and the clerk of the course came full  cry after the dogs with a whip.    By and by the horses strung across to the start at the far side of the  course. They fiddled about for a bit; then down went the flag and they  came sweeping along all bunched up together, one holding a nice  position on the inside. All of a sudden we heard a wild chorus of  imprecations--\"Look at that dog!\" Victor had chipped in with the  racehorses, and was running right in front of the field. It looked a  guinea to a gooseberry that some of them would fall on him.    The owners danced and swore. What did we mean by bringing a something  mongrel there to trip up and kill horses that were worth a paddockful of  all the horses we had ever owned, or would ever breed or own, even if we  lived to be a thousand. We were fairly in it and no mistake.    As the field came past the stand the first time we could hear the  riders swearing at our dog, and a wild yell of execration arose from  the public. He had got right among the ruck by this time, and was racing  alongside his friend The Trickler, thoroughly enjoying himself. After  passing the stand the pace became very merry; the dog stretched out all  he knew; when they began to make it too hot for him, he cut off corners,  and joined at odd intervals, and every time he made a fresh appearance  the people in the stand lifted up their voices and \"swore cruel\".    The horses were all at the whip as they turned into the straight, and  then The Trickler and the publican's mare singled out. We could hear  the \"chop, chop!\" of the whips as they came along together, but the mare  could not suffer it as long as the old fellow, and she swerved off while  he struggled home a winner by a length or so. Just as they settled down  to finish Victor dashed up on the inside, and passed the post at old  Trickler's girths. The populace immediately went for him with stones,  bottles, and other missiles, and he had to scratch gravel to save his  life. But imagine the amazement of the other owners when the judge  placed Trickler first, Victor second, and the publican's mare third!    The publican tried to argue it out with him. He said you couldn't place  a kangaroo-dog second in a horse-race.    The judge said it was _his_ (hiccough) business what he placed, and that  those who (hiccough) interfered with him would be sorry for it. Also he  expressed a (garnished) opinion that the publican's mare was no rotten  good, and that she was the right sort of mare for a poor man to own,  because she would keep him poor.    Then the publican called the judge a cow. The judge was willing; a rip,  tear, and chew fight ensued, which lasted some time. The judge won.

I am much mistaken if his  first impulse would not be to take a great flat stone and lay it on the  top; or rather a series of such, side by side, projecting well over the  edge of the wall veil. If, also, he proposed to lay a weight (as, for  instance, the end of a beam) on the wall, he would feel at once that the  pressure of this beam on, or rather among, the small stones of the wall  veil, might very possibly dislodge or disarrange some of them; and the  first impulse would be, in this case, also to lay a large flat stone on  the top of all to receive the beam, or any other weight, and distribute  it equally among the small stones below, as at _a_, Fig. IV.    [Illustration: Fig. IV.]    Sec. III. We must therefore have our flat stone in either case; and let  _b_, Fig. IV., be the section or side of it, as it is set across the  wall. Now, evidently, if by any chance this weight happen to be thrown  more on the edges of this stone than the centre, there will be a chance  of these edges breaking off. Had we not better, therefore, put another  stone, sloped off to the wall, beneath the projecting one, as at _c_.  But now our cornice looks somewhat too heavy for the wall; and as the  upper stone is evidently of needless thickness, we will thin it  somewhat, and we have the form _d_. Now observe: the lower or bevelled  stone here at _d_ corresponds to _d_ in the base (Fig. II., page 59).  That was the foot of the wall; this is its hand. And the top stone here,  which is a constant member of cornices, corresponds to the under stone  _c_, in Fig. II., which is a constant member of bases. The reader has no  idea at present of the enormous importance of these members; but as we  shall have to refer to them perpetually, I must ask him to compare them,  and fix their relations well in his mind: and, for convenience, I shall  call the bevelled or sloping stone, X, and the upright edged stone, Y.  The reader may remember easily which is which; for X is an intersection  of two slopes, and may therefore properly mean either of the two sloping  stones; and Y is a figure with a perpendicular line and two slopes, and  may therefore fitly stand for the upright stone in relation to each of  the sloping ones; and as we shall have to say much more about cornices  than about bases, let X and Y stand for the stones of the cornice, and  Xb and Yb for those of the base, when distinction is needed.    [Illustration: Fig. V.]    Sec. IV. Now the form at _d_, Fig. IV., is the great root and primal type  of all cornices whatsoever. In order to see what forms may be developed  from it, let us take its profile a little larger--_a_, Fig. V., with X  and Y duly marked. Now this form, being the root of all cornices, may  either have to finish the wall and so keep off rain; or, as so often  stated, to carry weight. If the former, it is evident that, in its  present profile, the rain will run back down the slope of X; and if the  latter, that the sharp angle or edge of X, at _k_, may be a little too  weak for its work, and run a chance of giving way. To avoid the evil in  the first case, suppose we hollow the slope of X inwards, as at _b_; and  to avoid it in the second case, suppose we strengthen X by letting it  bulge outwards, as at c.    Sec. V. These (_b_ and _c_) are the profiles of two vast families of  cornices, springing from the same root, which, with a third arising  from their combination (owing its origin to aesthetic considerations, and  inclining sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other), have been  employed, each on its third part of the architecture of the whole world  throughout all ages, and must continue to be so employed through such  time as is yet to come. We do not at present speak of the third or  combined group; but the relation of the two main branches to each other,  and to the line of origin, is given at _e_, Fig. V.; where the dotted  lines are the representatives of the two families, and the straight line  of the root. The slope of this right line, as well as the nature of the  curves, here drawn as segments of circles, we leave undetermined: the  slope, as well as the proportion of the depths of X and Y to each other,  vary according to the weight to be carried, the strength of the stone,  the size of the cornice, and a thousand other accidents; and the nature  of the curves according to aesthetic laws. It is in these infinite fields  that the invention of the architect is permitted to expatiate, but not  in the alteration of primitive forms.    Sec. VI. But to proceed. It will doubtless appear to the reader, that,  even allowing for some of these permissible variations in the curve or  slope of X, neither the form at _b_, nor any approximation to that form,  would be sufficiently undercut to keep the rain from running back upon it.  This is true; but we have to consider that the cornice, as the close of  the wall's life, is of all its features that which is best fitted for  honor and ornament. It has been esteemed so by almost all builders, and  has been lavishly decorated in modes hereafter to be considered. But it  is evident that, as it is high above the eye, the fittest place to  receive the decoration is the slope of X, which is inclined towards the  spectator; and if we cut away or hollow out this slope more than we have  done at _b_, all decoration will be hid in the shadow. If, therefore,  the climate be fine, and rain of long continuance not to be dreaded, we  shall not hollow the stone X further, adopting the curve at _b_ merely  as the most protective in our power. But if the climate be one in which  rain is frequent and dangerous, as in alternations with frost, we may be  compelled to consider the cornice in a character distinctly protective,  and to hollow out X farther, so as to enable it thoroughly to accomplish  its purpose. A cornice thus treated loses its character as the crown or  honor of the wall, takes the office of its protector, and is called a  DRIPSTONE. The dripstone is naturally the attribute of Northern  buildings, and therefore especially of Gothic architecture; the true  cornice is the attribute of Southern buildings, and therefore of Greek  and Italian architecture; and it is one of their peculiar beauties, and  eminent features of superiority.    Sec. VII. Before passing to the dripstone, however, let us examine a  little farther into the nature of the true cornice. We cannot, indeed,  render either of the forms _b_ or _c_, Fig. V., perfectly protective from  rain, but we can help them a little in their duty by a slight advance of  their upper ledge. This, with the form _b_, we can best manage by cutting  off the sharp upper point of its curve, which is evidently weak and  useless; and we shall have the form _f_. By a slight advance of the upper  stone _c_, we shall have the parallel form _g_.    These two cornices, _f_ and _g_, are characteristic of early Byzantine  work, and are found on all the most lovely examples of it in Venice. The  type _a_ is rarer, but occurs pure in the most exquisite piece of  composition in Venice--the northern portico of St. Mark's; and will be  given in due time.    Sec. VIII. Now the reader has doubtless noticed that these forms of  cornice result, from considerations of fitness and necessity, far more  neatly and decisively than the forms of the base, which we left only  very generally determined. The reason is, that there are many ways of  building foundations, and many _good_ ways, dependent upon the peculiar  accidents of the ground and nature of accessible materials. There is  also room to spare in width, and a chance of a part of the arrangement  being concealed by the ground, so as to modify height. But we have no  room to spare in width on the top of a wall, and all that we do must be  thoroughly visible; and we can but have to deal with bricks, or stones  of a certain degree of fineness, and not with mere gravel, or sand, or  clay,--so that as the conditions are limited, the forms become  determined; and our steps will be more clear and certain the farther we  advance. The sources of a river are usually half lost among moss and  pebbles, and its first movements doubtful in direction; but, as the  current gathers force, its banks are determined, and its branches are  numbered.    Sec. IX. So far of the true cornice: we have still to determine the form  of the dripstone.    [Illustration: Fig. VI.]    We go back to our primal type or root of cornice, _a_ of Fig. V. We take  this at _a_ in Fig. VI., and we are to consider it entirely as a  protection against rain. Now the only way in which the rain can be kept  from running back on the slope of X is by a bold hollowing out of it  upwards, _b_. But clearly, by thus doing, we shall so weaken the  projecting part of it that the least shock would break it at the neck,  _c_; we must therefore cut the whole out of one stone, which will give  us the form _d_. That the water may not lodge on the upper ledge of  this, we had better round it off; and it will better protect the joint  at the bottom of the slope if we let the stone project over it in a  roll, cutting the recess deeper above. These two changes are made in  _e_: _e_ is the type of dripstones; the projecting part being, however,  more or less rounded into an approximation to the shape of a falcon's  beak, and often reaching it completely. But the essential part of the  arrangement is the up and under cutting of the curve. Wherever we find  this, we are sure that the climate is wet, or that the builders have  been _bred_ in a wet country, and that the rest of the building will be  prepared for rough weather. The up cutting of the curve is sometimes all  the distinction between the mouldings of far-distant countries "]]]
