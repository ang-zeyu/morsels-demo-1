I purchased him  in the mountains of Virginia in the autumn of 1861, and he has been  my patient follower ever since--to Georgia, the Carolinas, and back to  Virginia. He carried me through the Seven Days battle around Richmond,  the second Manassas, at Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, the last day at  Chancellorsville, to Pennsylvania, at Gettysburg, and back to the  Rappahannock. From the commencement of the campaign in 1864 at Orange,  till its close around Petersburg, the saddle was scarcely off his back,  as he passed through the fire of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Cold  Harbour, and across the James River. He was almost in daily requisition  in the winter of 1864-65 on the long line of defenses from Chickahominy,  north of Richmond, to Hatcher's Run, south of the Appomattox. In the  campaign of 1865, he bore me from Petersburg to the final days at  Appomattox Court House. You must know the comfort he is to me in my  present retirement. He is well supplied with equipments. Two sets have  been sent to him from England, one from the ladies of Baltimore, and one  was made for him in Richmond; but I think his favourite is the American  saddle from St. Louis. Of all his companions in toil, 'Richmond,' 'Brown  Roan,' 'Ajax,' and quiet 'Lucy Long,' he is the only one that retained  his vigour. The first two expired under their onerous burden, and the  last two failed. You can, I am sure, from what I have said, paint his  portrait.\"    The general had the strongest affection for Traveller, which he showed  on all occasions, and his allowing me to ride him on this long march  was a great compliment. Possibly he wanted to give me a good hammering  before he turned me over to the cavalry. During my soldier life, so  far, I had been on foot, having backed nothing more lively than a tired  artillery horse; so I mounted with some misgivings, though I was very  proud of my steed. My misgivings were fully realised, for Traveller  would not walk a step. He took a short, high trot--a buck-trot, as  compared with a buck-jump--and kept it up to Fredericksburg, some thirty  miles. Though young, strong, and tough, I was glad when the journey  ended. This was my first introduction to the cavalry service. I think I  am safe in saying that I could have walked the distance with much less  discomfort and fatigue. My father having thus given me a horse and  presented me with one of his swords, also supplied my purse so that I  could get myself an outfit suitable to my new position, and he sent  me on to join my command, stationed not far away on the Rappahannock,  southward from Fredericksburg.    As an officer in the cavalry on the staff, I had more frequent  opportunities of seeing my father than as a private in the artillery. In  the course of duty, I was sometimes sent to him to report the condition  of affairs at the front, or on the flank of the army, and I also,  occasionally, paid him a visit. At these times, he would take me into  his tent, talk to me about my mother and sisters, about my horse and  myself, or the people and the country where my command happened to be  stationed. I think my presence was very grateful to him, and he seemed  to brighten up when I came. I remember, he always took it as a matter  of course that I must be hungry (and I was for three years), so he  invariably made his mess-steward, Bryan, give me something to eat, if I  did not have time to wait for the regular meal. His headquarters at  this time, just before the battle of Fredericksburg and after, were at  a point on the road between Fredericksburg and Hamilton's Crossing,  selected on account of its accessibility. Notwithstanding there was  near-by a good house vacant, he lived in his tents. His quarters were  very unpretentious, consisting of three or four \"wall-tents\" and several  more common ones. They were pitched on the edge of an old pine field,  near a grove of forest trees from which he drew his supply of fire-wood,  while the pines helped to shelter his tents and horses from the cold  winds. Though from the outside they were rather dismal, especially  through the dreary winter time, within they were cheerful, and  the surroundings as neat and comfortable as possible under the  circumstances.    On November 24, 1862, in a letter to his daughter Mary, he writes:    \"...General Burnside's whole army is apparently opposite Fredericksburg  and stretches from the Rappahannock to the Potomac. What his intentions  are he has not yet disclosed. I am sorry he is in position to oppress  our friends and citizens of the Northern Neck. He threatens to bombard  Fredericksburg, and the noble spirit displayed by its citizens,  particularly the women and children, has elicited my highest admiration.  They have been abandoning their homes, night and day, during all this  inclement weather, cheerfully and uncomplainingly, with only such  assistance as our wagons and ambulances could afford, women, girls,  children, trudging through the mud and bivouacking in the open fields.\"    How the battle of Fredericksburg was fought and won all the world has  heard, and I shall not attempt to describe it. On December 11th, the day  Burnside commenced his attack, General Lee wrote to my mother:    \"...The enemy, after bombarding the town of Fredericksburg, setting  fire to many houses and knocking down nearly all those along the river,  crossed over a large force about dark, and now occupies the town. We  hold the hills commanding it, and hope we shall be able to damage him  yet. His position and heavy guns command the town entirely.\"    On December 16th, in another letter to my mother, he tells of the  recrossing of the Federals:    \"I had supposed they were just preparing for battle, and was saving our  men for the conflict. Their hosts crown the hill and plain beyond the  river, and their numbers to me are unknown. Still I felt the confidence  we could stand the shock, and was anxious for the blow that is to fall  on some point, and was prepared to meet it here. Yesterday evening I  had my suspicions that they might return during the night, but could not  believe they would relinquish their hopes after all their boasting and  preparation, and when I say that the latter is equal to the former you  will have some idea of the magnitude. This morning they were all safe  on the north side of the Rappahannock. They went as they came--in the  night. They suffered heavily as far as the battle went, but it did not  go far enough to satisfy me. Our loss was comparatively slight, and  I think will not exceed two thousand. The contest will have now to be  renewed, but on what field I cannot say.\"    I did not see my father at any time during the fighting; some days after  it was all over, I saw him, as calm and composed as if nothing unusual  had happened, and he never referred to his great victory, except to  deplore the loss of his brave officers and soldiers or the sufferings of  the sick and wounded. He repeatedly referred to the hardships so bravely  endured by the inhabitants of Fredericksburg, who had been obliged to  flee from the town, the women and children, the old and the feeble,  whose sufferings cut him to the heart. On Christmas Day he writes to his  youngest daughter, Mildred, who was at school in North Carolina:    \"...I cannot tell you how I long to see you when a little quiet occurs.  My thoughts revert to you, your sisters, and your mother; my heart aches  for our reunion. Your brothers I see occasionally. This morning Fitzhugh  rode by with his young aide-de-camp (Rob) at the head of his brigade,  on his way up the Rappahannock. You must study hard, gain knowledge, and  learn your duty to God and your neighbour: that is the great object  of life. I have no news, confined constantly to camp, and my thoughts  occupied with its necessities and duties. I am, however, happy in the  knowledge that General Burnside and army will not eat their promised  Christmas dinner in Richmond to-day.\"    On the next day he writes as follows to his daughter Agnes, who was with  her mother in Richmond:    \"Camp Fredericksburg, December 26, 1862.    \"My Precious Little Agnes: I have not heard of you for a long time. I  wish you were with me, for always solitary, I am sometimes weary, and  long for the reunion of my family once again. But I will not speak of  myself, but of you.... I have seen the ladies in this vicinity only when  flying from the enemy, and it caused me acute grief to witness their  exposure and suffering. But a more noble spirit was never displayed  anywhere. The faces of old and young were wreathed with smiles, and  glowed with happiness at their sacrifices for the good of their country.  Many have lost EVERYTHING. What the fire and shells of the enemy spared,  their pillagers destroyed. But God will shelter them, I know. So much  heroism will not be unregarded. I can only hold oral communication with  your sister [His daughter Mary, in King George county, within the lines  of the enemy], and have forbidden the scouts to bring any writing, and  have taken some back that I had given them for her. If caught, it would  compromise them. They only convey messages. I learn in that way she is  well.    \"Your devoted father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    I give another letter he wrote on Christmas Day, besides the one quoted  above, to his daughter, Mildred. It was written to his wife, and is  interesting as giving an insight into his private feelings and views  regarding this great victory:    \"...I will commence this holy day by writing to you. My heart is filled  with gratitude to Almighty God for His unspeakable mercies with which  He has blessed us in this day, for those He has granted us from the  beginning of life, and particularly for those He has vouchsafed us  during the past year. What should have become of us without His crowning  help and protection?

Get the skin on face and around mouth placed, then draw the  neck skin tight and nail to the edge of the board with finishing brads  an inch or more long. Any surplus remaining can be trimmed away. A  square of rough board, screwed on the end of the neck, will enable it to  stand on the bench with nose up while the final touches are put on the  anatomy of the head and face.    [Illustration: PAPER HEAD AND EAR FORMS.]    The split lips filled with a little clay are placed and will usually  stay without pinning if the lower lips are tucked under where they  belong. Fill the end of the nose and around the nostrils nicely, no live  deer ever had a shriveled up nose. Fill under the eyebrows as the skin  there was quite thick before paring. Set the eyes, after filling sockets  with clay. A little work with a sharp awl will put the lids in place  with lashes disposed aright. If the ears have not been permanently  fixed, do so now filling out their bases with stuffers and thrusting  stout wires into the head to keep them set until dry. A few stitches are  taken to hold the skin of both sides of the ears together, when dry they  are removed. Brush the hair down and if it persists in rough spots,  paste them and then smooth down. When dry the comb and brush will remove  the scales of paste readily along with any dirt from the hair. When dry  clean the antlers and oil them lightly, brush out the hair and clean all  clay from eyes and nose. Connect the eyes and lids with black wax, model  the inside of nostrils with cream or pink wax and varnish the end of  nose and any bare lip that may show. Pins and brads that will show are  drawn out and others cut off level with the skin. The head which has  hung drying on the rough board may be removed to a finished shield as  complete.    [Illustration: FINISHED HEAD.    (Author's work.)]    The paper form method has numerous advantages but is not always  convenient to procure. It will save the beginner much tedious work and  greatly expedite matters for the professional. These forms as supplied  by dealers are of the entire head and neck. By cutting off the neck at  the proper point, nailing in the neck board and screwing the plate of  bone at the base of the antlers to a block in the top of head it is  ready to receive the skin. It will require but a short time for the skin  to dry on this foundation so the finished head is often ready to return  at the end of a week.    [Illustration: PAPER HEAD FORMS FOR ELK AND DEER HEADS.]    For a number of years I have used a modification of this process. In  this the form is cast in halves which are joined on a board cut to the  outline of the head and neck. This will afford a secure attachment for  the antlers and in addition the skin of the neck may be nailed securely  each side of the opening cut, making any ripping or opening by shrinkage  at that point forever impossible.    These paper forms may be bought or made in various sizes, so by the  addition of a small amount of some modelling material any skin is  fitted. With a supply of them on hand work can be turned out rapidly  during the busy season.    These directions for mounting will apply equally in case of moose, elk  or other large game heads, always providing supports adequate for the  larger animals. A mounted head with insufficient and wabbly mechanical  construction is not a joy forever.    The head of a common sheep or ram is a good one for the beginner, as its  coat of wool covers small defects. It is a convenient size to handle and  if not entirely successful no great expense has been incurred. On the  other hand a fairly mounted ram's head is quite ornamental and suitable,  especially on the wall of a country house.          CHAPTER XVIII.    MOUNTING HORNS AND ANTLERS.      A neatly mounted set of antlers or horns are an ornament anywhere, in  the home, office or public room, and in case any one of the out-o'-door  fraternity wishes to try setting up a pair, I will give a few simple  directions and hints which may be helpful. Some bits of lumber, screws,  plaster of paris, plush or leather, tacks, etc., are about all the  materials needed; also a one-fourth inch drill bit to make the necessary  holes in the frontal bone.    By sawing off the top of the skull down to the eyes we separate the  antlers and the frontal bone on which they grow, from the rest of the  skull.    Care should be taken to leave the same amount of bone on each side, so  the antlers will be the same distance from the wall.    For antlers of small or medium size eastern deer, cut a heart-shaped  block about 4x5 inches from a piece of soft 7/8-inch board. The edges of  this should be slightly beveled toward one side. This may be cut out in  its finished shape with a keyhole saw, or roughed out with a hand saw,  and trimmed up with a draw knife or wood rasp.    After drilling two or three holes in the plate of bone attached to the  antlers, arrange them evenly on this block and screw fast, using screws  which will not protrude from the back of the block. If the bone is  uneven or the antlers do not hang right, small pieces of wood may be  inserted at one side or the other until the desired effect is had. Now  put a half pint of water in some old dish and mix in plaster of paris  until it is like very thin putty. With an old knife you can spread this  over the bone and round it up nearly to the burr of the antlers.    [Illustration]    If the first mixing is not enough, mix a little more, for if too much  plaster is put on anywhere it can be easily scraped off before it gets  dry. This needs to be put on quickly as the plaster soon \"sets\" or  hardens and in fifteen or twenty minutes it can be scraped and trimmed  to a smooth, rounding surface.    For covering this wood and plaster base, plush, soft leather or  pantasote is used. Plush or velvet is the easiest to apply for a  beginner. A piece about nine inches square will do for our set of small  antlers. Lay this on the plaster and turning it over the edge of the  block, tack it on the back with carpet tacks, beginning in the center,  at top and bottom. Slit in each side to the antler and cut a hole large  enough to be a snug fit for the antler below the burr. Draw on and tack,  getting the wrinkles out as you proceed, the lower, or front part,  first. Lap the upper or back over it neatly at each side, turning the  edges under and fastening them with a few stitches.    It is a good plan to drive the tacks only part way at first, then they  can be easily drawn and re-arranged. Now cut two strips of the material  to go around below the burr of the antlers. Turn the edges of these  under, draw them tightly around and fasten the ends together back of the  antlers with a few stitches.    They are now ready for fastening on a shield or panel. Cattle horns  should have the piece of bone connecting them screwed to a long oval  block, then treated similarly. Horns of sheep, cattle and goats  frequently come loose from the bony core. A little plaster mixed very  thin and poured inside the horn just before replacing them will fasten  them on again.    Do not try to polish, paint, gild or otherwise improve the natural  appearance of deer antlers. Wash and clean them well and rub in a little  linseed oil. Polishing brings out the beauty of horns of cattle and  bison, if the operator is lavish of elbow grease.    The process is this: Fasten the horns firmly somewhere and attack first  with rasp, then file, scrape with glass, fine sandpaper, finer  sandpaper, powdered pumice stone, putty powder. Finish with oiled rag.  Old bison horn, weathered on the prairies till they resemble old roots,  can be made to look like polished ebony by the above formula. Don't  forget to add the elbow grease, though.    [Illustration: BOLTING \"SHED\" ANTLERS TO 2 x 4 BLOCK.]    Shed antlers are a different and rather difficult proposition. It is a  tedious job to drill them and insert heavy irons in their bases so  firmly as to prevent turning. Often they are cut off at a bevel, drilled  and screwed directly to the shield with brass round headed screws.    By drilling into the base of a shed antler, above the burr, in a  diagonal direction it may be bolted to a short piece of 2x4 scantling.  Fasten both antlers on this in a natural position in relation to each  other, then drill a second hole in each and bolt them fast, using  machine bolts and countersinking the heads in the antlers by chiseling.    [Illustration: SHED ELK ANTLERS TO BE MOUNTED. From National Zoological  Park Washington, D. C.]    The piece of scantling will need to be carved a little in order to get a  good bearing for the butt of the antlers. This artificial forehead, as  we might call it, is to be fastened to a heart-shaped block by nailing  or screwing from the back and covered as directed before.    If the countersunk bolt heads are carefully modelled over with putty or  \"mache\" and colored like the antlers no one will know they are not  attached to a 'bony' fide forehead.    Elk antlers will need 5/16 inch bolts, while 1/4 inch is sufficient for  most deer antlers; indeed screws of that diameter will hold a small pair  quite securely.    Sometimes the upper part of the skull is scraped, bleached and fastened  entire to the shield with brass screws or bolts.    The base block for large deer antlers should be thicker and larger in  proportion. Elk and moose antlers requiring to be fastened with heavy  coach or lag-screws to a block cut from two-inch plank.    Africa has a profusion of horned game mostly of the antelope family and  of late years many of these horns find their way to the walls in this  country.    They are mounted as directed for the deer with the exception that many  of them are improved by polishing the tips or even nearly the entire  length of the horns. As most of them are corrugated or twisted in great  variety this calls for"]]]
