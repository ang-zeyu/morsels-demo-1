One day his lordship came into Court very late, looking very woeful. He  apologised to the Bar for being obliged to adjourn the Court at once and  dismiss the jury for that day. \"Though,\" his lordship added, \"I am aware  that an important issue stands for trial. But, the fact is, gentlemen  (addressing the Bar in a low tone of voice and somewhat confidentially),  I have met with a domestic misfortune, which has altogether deranged my  nerves. Poor Lady Carleton has, most unfortunately, miscarried,  and--.\" \"Oh, then, my lord,\" exclaimed Curran, \"I am sure we are all  quite satisfied your lordship has done right in deciding there is no  _issue_ to try to-day.\" His lordship smiled a ghastly smile, and,  retiring, thanked the Bar for their sympathy.           *       *       *       *       *    Judge Foster was trying five prisoners for murder, and misunderstood the  drift of the evidence. Four of the prisoners seem to have assisted, but  a witness said as to the fifth, Denis Halligan, that it was he who gave  the fatal blow: \"My lord, I saw Denis Halligan (that's in the dock  there) take a vacancy (Irish word for 'aim' at an unguarded part) at the  poor soul that's kilt, and give him a wipe with a _clehalpin_ (Irish  word for 'bludgeon'), and lay him down as quiet as a child.\" They were  found guilty. The judge, sentencing the first four, gave them seven  years' imprisonment. But when he came to Halligan, who really killed the  deceased, the judge said, \"Denis Halligan, I have purposely reserved the  consideration of your case to the last. Your crime is doubtless of a  grievous nature, yet I cannot avoid taking into consideration the  mitigating circumstances that attend it. By the evidence of the witness  it clearly appears that _you_ were the only one of the party who showed  any mercy to the unfortunate deceased. You took him to a vacant seat,  and wiped him with a clean napkin, and you laid him down with the  gentleness one shows to a little child. In consideration of these  extenuating circumstances, which reflect some credit upon you, I shall  inflict upon you three weeks' imprisonment.\" So Denis Halligan got off  by the judge mistaking a vacancy for a vacant seat, and a _clehalpin_  for a clean napkin.    John Toler (Lord Norbury) was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in  Ireland. His humour was broad, and his absolute indifference to  propriety often saved the situation by converting a serious matter into  a wholly ludicrous one. His Court was in constant uproar, owing to his  noisy jesting, and like a noted old Scottish judge he would have his  joke when the life of a human being was hanging in the balance. Even on  his own deathbed he could not resist the impulse. On hearing that his  friend Lord Erne was also nearing his end at the same time, he called  for his valet: \"James,\" said Lord Norbury, \"run round to Lord Erne and  tell him with my compliments that it will be a _dead_-heat between us.\"    The best illustration of the almost daily condition of things when Lord  Norbury presided at Nisi Prius is given by himself in his reply to the  answer of a witness. \"What is your business?\" asked the judge. \"I keep a  _racquet-court_, my lord.\"--\"So do I, so do I,\" immediately exclaimed  the judge. Nor did he reserve his _bon mots_ for Court merriment.  Passing the Quay on his way to the Four Courts one morning, he noticed a  crowd and inquired of a bystander the cause of it. On being told that a  tailor had just been rescued from attempted suicide by drowning, his  lordship exclaimed, \"What a fool to leave his _hot goose_ for a _cold  duck_.\" The boastful statement of a gentleman in his company that he had  shot seventy hares before breakfast drew from the Chief Justice the  sarcastic remark, \"I suppose, sir, you fired at a wig.\"    A son of a peer having been accused of arson, of which offence he was  generally believed guilty, but acquitted on a point of insufficiency of  evidence to sustain the indictment, was tried before Lord Norbury. The  young gentleman met the judge next at the Lord-Lieutenant's levee in the  Castle. Instead of avoiding the Chief Justice, the scion of nobility  boldly said, \"I have recently married, and have come here to enable me  to present my bride at the Drawing-Room.\"--\"Quite right to mind the  Scripture. Better marry than burn,\" retorted Lord Norbury.    A barrister once pressed him to non-suit the plaintiff in a case; but  his lordship decided to let it go to a jury trial. \"I do believe,\" said  the disappointed advocate, \"your lordship has not the _courage to  non-suit_.\"--\"You say, sir,\" replied the irate judge, \"you don't believe  I'd have the courage to non-suit. I tell you I have courage to _shoot_  and to _non-shoot_, but I'll not non-suit for you.\" This same counsel  was once horsewhipped by an army officer at Nelson's Pillar in Sackville  Street, and applied for a Criminal Information against his assailant.  \"Certainly he shall have it,\" said the witty judge. \"The Court is bound  to give protection to any one who has _bled under the gallant Nelson_.\"    On a motion before this judge, a sheriff's officer, who had the  hardihood to serve a process in Connemara, where the king's writ _did  not run_, swore that the natives made him eat and swallow both copy and  original. Norbury, affecting great disgust, exclaimed: \"Jackson,  Jackson, I hope it's not made returnable into this Court.\"    While giving a judgment on a writ of right, Lord Norbury observed that  it was not sufficient for a demandant to say he \"claimed by descent.\"  \"Such an answer,\" he continued, \"would be a shrewd one for a sweep, who  got into your house by coming down the chimney; and it would be an easy,  as well as a sweeping, way of getting in.\"    His lordship was attacked by a fit of gout when on Circuit, and sent to  the Solicitor-General requesting the loan of a pair of large slippers.  \"Take them,\" said the Solicitor to the servant, \"with my respects, and I  hope soon to be in his lordship's shoes.\"    At the instigation of O'Connell, Lord Norbury was finally removed from  the Bench. A flagrant case of partiality was brought to Lord Brougham's  notice which exasperated Lord Norbury, and he is reported to have said,  \"I'll resign to demand satisfaction. That Scottish Broom wants to be  made acquainted with an Irish stick.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Two notorious highwaymen were charged before Chief Baron O'Grady with  robbery, and to the surprise of all the jury returned a verdict of not  guilty. \"Mr. Murphy,\" said the judge to the gaoler, \"you will greatly  ease my mind by keeping these two respectable gentlemen in custody until  seven o'clock. I leave for Dublin at five, and I should like to have at  least two hours' start of them.\" There is also the story of a barrister  who made an eloquent speech and got his client off, but he was very  anxious to know whether the prisoner was guilty or not. \"Well, sir,\"  said the man when applied to, \"to tell the truth I thought I was guilty  until I heard you speak, and then I didn't see how I could be.\" This at  once recalls an old story. \"Prisoner, I understand you confess your  guilt,\" said the judge. \"No, I don't,\" said the prisoner. \"My counsel  has convinced me of my innocence.\"    On hearing that some spendthrift barristers, friends of his, were  appointed to be Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors the Chief Baron  remarked, \"At all events, the insolvents can't complain of not being  tried by their peers.\" It was the same judge who caustically observed,  after a long and dull legal argument: \"I agree with my brother J----,  for the reasons given by my brother M----.\" A prisoner once was given a  practical specimen of his lordship's wit, and must have been rather  distressed by it. He was passing sentence upon a pickpocket, and  ordering a punishment common at that time. \"You will be whipped from  North Gate to South Gate,\" said the judge. \"Bad luck to you, you old  blackguard,\" said the prisoner. \"--And back again,\" said the Chief  Baron, as if he had been interrupted in the delivery of the sentence.    A cause of much celebrity was tried at a county Assize, at which Chief  Baron O'Grady presided. Bushe, then a K.C., who held a brief for the  defence, was pleading the cause of his client with much eloquence, when  a donkey in the courtyard outside set up a loud bray. \"One at a time,  brother Bushe!\" called out his lordship. Peals of laughter filled the  Court. The counsel bore the interruption as best he could. The judge was  proceeding to sum up with his usual ability: the donkey again began to  bray. \"I beg your lordship's pardon,\" said Bushe, putting his hand to  his ear; \"but there is such an echo in the Court that I can't hear a  word you say.\"    In his charges to juries, O'Grady frequently made some quaint remarks.  There was a Kerry case in which a number of men were indicted for riot  and assault. Several of them bore the familiar names of O'Donoghue,  Moriarty, Duggan, &c., while among the jurymen these names were also  found. Well knowing that consanguinity was prevalent in the district,  the judge began his address to the jury with the significant remark: \"Of  course, gentlemen, you will acquit your own relatives.\" In another case  of larceny of pantaloons which was clearly proved, but in which the  thief got a good character for honesty, he began: \"Gentlemen, the  prisoner was an honest boy, but he stole the pantaloons.\"    \"I merely wish to address your lordship on the form of the indictment,  if your lordship pleases,\" said a young barrister to the Chief Baron.  \"Oh, certainly, I will hear you with mighty great pleasure, sir; but  I'll be after taking the verdict of the jury first,\" was the sarcastic  reply.    The brother of Chief Baron O'Grady once caught a boy stealing turnips"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#16)"],[1,"springs back to protect the pollen against the  inroads of flies, mining bees, and beetles. As the longer stamens  shed their pollen before the shorter ones mature theirs, bees  must visit the flower several times to collect it all.      MONKEY-FLOWER    (Minulus ringens)  Figwort family    Flowers - Purple, violet, or lilac, rarely whitish; about 1 in.  long, solitary, borne on slender footstems from axils of upper  leaves. Calyx prismatic, 5-angled, 5-toothed; corolla irregular,  tubular, narrow in throat, 2-lipped; upper lip 2-lobed, erect;  under lip 3-lobed, spreading; 4 stamens, a long and a short pair,  inserted on corolla tube; pistil with 2-lobed, plate-like stigma.  Stem: Square, erect, usually branched, 1 to 3 ft. high. Leaves:  Opposite, oblong to lance-shaped, saw-edged, mostly seated on  stem.  Preferred Habitat - Swamps, beside streams and ponds.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - Manitoba, Nebraska, and Texas, eastward to  Atlantic Ocean.    No wader is the square-stemmed Monkey-flower whose grinning  corolla peers at one from grassy tuffets in swamps, from the  brookside, the springy soil of low meadows, and damp hollows  beside the road; but moisture it must have to fill its nectary  and to soften the ground for the easier transit of its creeping  rootstock. Imaginative eyes see what appears to them the gaping  (ringens) face of a little ape or buffoon (mimulus) in this  common flower whose drolleries, such as they are, call forth the  only applause desired - the buzz of insects that become  pollen-laden during the entertainment.    Now the advanced stigma of this flower is peculiarly irritable,  and closes up on contact with an incoming visitor's body, thus  exposing the pollen-laden anthers behind it, and, except in rare  cases, preventing self-fertilization. Delpino was the first to  guess what advantage so sensitive a stigma might mean. Probably  the smaller bees find the tube too long for their short tongues.  The yellow palate, which partially guards the entrance to the  nectary from pilferers, of course serves also as a pathfinder to  the long-tongued bees.      AMERICAN BROOKLIME    (Veronica Americana)  Figwort family    Flowers - Light blue to white, usually striped with deep blue or  purple structure of flower similar to that of V. officinalis, but  borne in long, loose racemes branching outward on stems that  spring from axils of most of the leaves. Stem: Without hairs,  usually branched, 6 in. to 3 ft. long, lying partly on ground and  rooting from lower joints. Leaves: Oblong, lance-shaped,  saw-edged, opposite, petioled, and lacking hairs; 1 to 3 in.  long, 1/4 to 1 in. wide. Fruit: A nearly round, compressed, but  not flat, capsule with flat seeds in 2 cells.  Preferred Habitat - In brooks, ponds, ditches, swamps.  Flowering Season - April-September.  Distribution - From Atlantic to Pacific, Alaska to California and  New Mexico, Quebec to Pennsylvania.    This, the perhaps most beautiful native speedwell, whose sheets  of blue along the brookside are so frequently mistaken for masses  of forget-me-nots by the hasty observer, of course shows marked  differences on closer investigation; its tiny blue flowers are  marked with purple pathfinders, and the plant is not hairy, to  mention only two. But the poets of England are responsible for  most of whatever confusion stills lurks in the popular mind  concerning these two flowers. Speedwell, a common medieval  benediction from a friend, equivalent to our farewell or adieu,  and forget - me-not of similar intent, have been used  interchangeably by some writers in connection with parting gifts  of small blue flowers. It was the germander speedwell that in  literature and botanies alike was most commonly known as the  forget-me-not for over two hundred years, or until only fifty  years ago. When the \"Mayflower\" and her sister ships were  launched; \"Speedwell\" was considered a happier name for a vessel  than it proved to be.    The WATER SPEEDWELL, or PIMPERNEL (V. Anagallis-aquatica),  differs from the preceding chiefly in having most of its leaves  seated on the stalk, only the lower ones possessing stems, and  those short ones. In autumn the increased growth of sterile  shoots from runners produce almost circular leaves, often two  inches broad, a certain aid to identification.    Another close relation, the MARSH or SKULLCAP SPEEDWELL (V.  scutellata), on the other hand, has long, very slender, acute  leaves, their teeth far apart; and as these three species are the  only members of their clan likely to be found in watery places  within our limits, a close examination of the leaves of any  water-loving plant bearing small four-lobed blue flowers, usually  marked with lines of a deeper blue or purple, should enable one  to correctly name the species. None of these blossoms can be  carried far after being picked; they have a tantalizing habit of  dropping off, leaving a bouquet of tiny green calices chiefly.    Many kinds of bees, wasps, flies, and butterflies fertilize all  these little flowers, which are first staminate, then pistillate,  simply by crawling over them in search of nectar.      COMMON SPEEDWELL; FLUELLIN; PAUL'S BETONY; GROUND-HELE    (Veronica officinalis)  Figwort family    Flowers - Pale blue, very small, crowded on spike-like racemes  from axils of leaves, often from alternate axils. Calyx 4-parted;  corolla of 4 lobes, lower lobe commonly narrowest ; 2 divergent  stamens inserted at base and on either side of upper corolla lobe  ; a knob-like stigma on solitary pistil. Stem: From 3 to 10 in.  long, hairy, often prostrate, and rooting at joints. Leaves:  Opposite, oblong, obtuse, saw-edged, narrowed at base. Fruit:  Compressed heart-shaped capsule, containing numerous flat seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Dry fields, uplands, open woods.  Flowering Season - May-August.  Distribution - From Michigan and Tennessee eastward, also from  Ontario to Nova Scotia. Probably an immigrant from Europe and  Asia.    An ancient tradition of the Roman Church relates that when Jesus  was on His way to Calvary, He passed the home of a certain Jewish  maiden, who, when she saw the drops of agony on His brow, ran  after Him along the road to wipe His face with her kerchief. This  linen, the monks declared, ever after bore the impress of the  sacred features - vera iconica, the true likeness. When the  Church wished to canonize the pitying maiden, an abbreviated form  of the Latin words was given her, St. Veronica, and her kerchief  became one of the most precious relics at St. Peter's, where it  is said to be still preserved. Medieval flower lovers, whose  piety seems to have been eclipsed only by their imaginations,  named this little flower from a fancied resemblance to the relic.  Of course, special healing virtue was attributed to the square of  pictured linen, and since all could not go to Rome to be cured by  it, naturally the next step was to employ the common, wayside  plant that bore the saint's name. Mental healers will not be  surprised to learn that because of the strong popular belief in  its efficacy to cure all fleshly ills, it actually seemed to  possess miraculous powers. For scrofula it was said to be the  infallible remedy, and presently we find Linnaeus grouping this  flower, and all its relatives under the family name of  Scrofulariaceae. \"What's in a name?\" Religion, theology,  medicine, folk-lore, metaphysics, what not?    One of the most common wild flowers in England is this same  familiar little blossom of that lovely shade of blue known by  Chinese artists as \"the sky after rain.\" \"The prettiest of all  humble roadside flowers I saw,\" says Burroughs, in \"A Glance at  British Wild Flowers.\" \"It is prettier than the violet, and  larger and deeper colored than our houstonia. It is a small and  delicate edition of our hepatica, done in indigo blue, and wonted  to the grass in the fields and by the waysides.        'The little speedwell's darling blue'    sings Tennyson. I saw it blooming with the daisy and buttercup  upon the grave of Carlyle. The tender human and poetic element of  his stern, rocky nature was well expressed by it.\"    Only as it grows in masses is the speedwell conspicuous - a  sufficient reason for its habit of forming colonies and of  gathering its insignificant blossoms together into dense spikes,  since by these methods it issues a flaunting advertisement of its  nectar. The flower that simplifies dining for insects has its  certain reward in rapidly increased and vigorous descendants. To  save repetition, the reader interested in the process of  fertilization is referred to the account of the Maryland figwort,  since many members of the large family to which both belong  employ the same method of economizing pollen and insuring fertile  seed. In this case visitors have only to crawl over the tiny  blossoms.    >From Labrador to Alaska, throughout almost every section of the  United States, in South America, Europe, and Asia, roams the  THYME-LEAVED SPEEDWELL (V. serpyllifolia), by the help of its  numerous flat seeds, that are easily transported on the wind, and  by its branching stem, that lies partly on the ground, rooting  where the joints touch earth. The small oval leaves, barely half  an inch long, grow in pairs. The tiny blue, or sometimes white,  flowers, with dark pathfinders to the nectary, are borne on  spike-like racemes at the ends of the stem and branches that rear  themselves upward in fields and thickets to display their bloom  before the passing bee.      PALE, or NAKED, or ONE-FLOWERED BROOM-RAPE    (Thalesia uniflora; Aphyllon uniflorum of Gray)  Broom-rape  family    Flowers - Violet, rarely white, delicately fragrant, solitary at  end of erect, glandular peduncles. Calyx hairy, bell-shaped,  5-toothed, not half the length of corolla, which is 1 in. or less  long, with curved tube spreading into 2 lips, 5-lobed,  yellow-bearded within; 4 stamens, in"]]]
