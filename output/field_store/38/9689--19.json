It must not be supposed, however, that this visit was in vain. The  leaders of the mission had long felt their isolation from the rest of  the world, and the new difficulties which the growth of a European  population in the Bay was beginning to bring forth. They received much  encouragement from the good bishop's counsel, and were placed in a  better position for dealing with the white men. The sick were cheered by  his sympathetic ministrations, and all classes united in expressing the  farewell hope that he would not forget them but would soon visit them  again.    This hope was destined not to be realised; but the bishop left behind  him a permanent addition to the mission staff in the person of a young  Oxford undergraduate, who had been driven by delicate health to leave  England and to undertake the long sea voyage to Australia. The bishop  had admitted him to the diaconate in Sydney, and now at Paihia ordained  him to the priesthood. Octavius Hadfield was still in a state of extreme  delicacy, but he resolved to dedicate whatever might remain to him of  life and strength to the service of Christ among the Maoris.    Neither bishop nor priest, however, nor yet catechist nor settler, was  to be the most signal agent in the extension of the work during these  wonderful \"years of the right hand of the Most Highest.\" Their labours  were indeed richly blest, as the preceding pages have sufficiently  shown. But the humbler instruments whose work has now to be recorded  stand out in bolder relief, owing to the amazing contrast between the  insignificance of the means and the magnitude of the results achieved.    The east side of New Zealand was brought into contact with the mission  through the prevailing winds which blow from that quarter. In the year  1833 there arrived in the Bay of Islands a ship which, while lying  becalmed off the East Cape, had received on board a party of some dozen  Maoris from the shore. Before they could be landed, the wind had sprung  up, and thus they were carried into the territory of their enemies, who  immediately proceeded to allot them as slaves. But the wind was not an  altogether unkind one, for it had brought them within reach of Christian  influences. The missionaries rescued the men and sent them eastwards  again. Before they could land, however, they were again blown away by a  sudden gale, and once more found themselves at the Bay. Here they were  kept at Paihia for the winter, and in the summer of 1834 were at last  successfully restored to their friends. They were accompanied on this  occasion by Mr. William Williams, who found a warm welcome among the  kinsfolk of the returned refugees. He even marked out a spot in the  Waiapu valley for a future mission station. Nothing more, however, was  done for some years; the incident, though deeply interesting, was  well-nigh forgotten, and \"it was hardly thought that any good results  would follow.\"    Neither might any good results have followed had the matter lain with  the twelve men who had passed through the adventures just described. Of  course, they spread a favourable report of their kind rescuers, and this  was not to be despised. But there was not a sufficiently definite  Christianity among them to qualify them to be teachers of their people.  The nine days' wonder of their deliverance would soon have given place  to the all-engrossing thoughts of war and vengeance.    But they did not come back alone. With them came some slaves who had  been carried to the Bay in earlier days by one of Hongi's raiding  parties, and had now been set free by their Christian masters. One of  these, Taumatakura, had attended school at Waimate, and though he had  shown little interest in religion, he had at least learned to read. This  man, on finding himself now among a people who were hungering for  knowledge, began to teach and to preach. He wrote out verses and hymns  on strips of paper, and these were cherished by his tribesmen with a  superstitious veneration. His reputation increased to such a degree that  when a military expedition was set on foot he was asked to accompany it.  The armament was a great one, for it consisted of all the warriors for  100 miles down the coast, and it was strengthened by the alliance of the  tribes of the Bay of Plenty. The object of the expedition was the  capture of a strong _pa_ near Cape Runaway--the promontory which juts  northwards into the ocean above East Cape. Taumatakura was by this time  sufficiently confident to be able to make conditions. He stipulated that  there must be no cannibalism nor any unnecessary destruction of canoes  and food. His conditions were accepted, and the advance was begun. In  the final assault upon the _pa_, what was the surprise of all the chiefs  to see the one-time slave actually leading the attack! Fearlessly he  rushed onward--gospel in one hand and musket in the other--amid a hail  of bullets. Neither he nor his book was hit; and when the citadel was  captured, Taumatakura was the hero of the day. Evidently his book was a  charm of power: his words must be obeyed. Not only were his stipulations  observed, but anything else he taught was now received with implicit  deference. He did not know much, but at least he proclaimed the sanctity  of the _Ra-tapu_ or weekly day of rest.    Such was the news which reached William Williams at Waimate in the  spring of 1837. \"Why do you stay here,\" said the stranger, \"while over  there at Waiapu they are all ready to do what you tell them?\" Early in  the following year, accordingly, Messrs. W. Williams and Colenso went by  sea to Hicks Bay, and walked under the cliffs along the coast for 100  miles. Wherever a valley opened they found a large and populous village;  and everywhere the Sunday was observed, and there was an outcry for  books and teachers. In one place, indeed, the people kept _two_ sabbaths  each week. The field was ripe unto harvest. Later in the year, Henry  Williams took six native teachers to occupy the field; and finally, in  1840, his brother removed thither with his family, and settled at  Turanga in Poverty Bay. His labours were strikingly successful, and soon  there was a church and an overflowing congregation in every _pa_. Thus  wonderfully and unexpectedly began what was afterwards to become the  diocese of Waiapu.    More directly in the central line of advance, and certainly not less  romantic in its beginnings, was the extension of the faith to the shores  of Cook Strait.    Reference has already been made to the evangelising expedition from  Tauranga into this country. But before it could have reached its  destination, a still more humble agent had been at work, whose position,  like that of Taumatakura, was that of a liberated slave, and whose  story, like his, begins at the Bay of Islands.    It must have been in the year 1836, or somewhat earlier, that the little  cemetery at Paihia became the receptacle of the headless body of a Maori  who had been killed in a quarrel. With the body came a slave who was now  left without an owner. The missionaries took him into house and school,  and were pleased with his behaviour. Ripahau showed no signs, however,  of becoming a Christian, and after a time asked leave to join a fighting  party which was leaving the Bay for Rotorua. He seems to have become  known there to Mr. Chapman, but he soon disappeared, and for two years  nothing was heard of him. At last, Chapman received from him a letter  asking for books. The letter came from Cook Strait, and explained that  the people of that neighbourhood were eager to receive instruction.  Shortly afterwards two young chiefs from the same quarter presented  themselves at the Bay of Islands with a story which thrilled the hearers  with wonder and gratitude.    To understand its purport it is necessary to cast a backward glance over  the years since the early days of the mission, when the Ngapuhi were  procuring firearms from traders and missionaries. Hongi was not the only  man in those days who foresaw the power which the musket would give.  Rauparaha, the young chief of a small tribe living round the harbour of  Kawhia on the West Coast, realised that his Waikato neighbours must from  their geographical position acquire the precious weapons before his own  tribe could do so. The outlook was desperate, and the remedy must be of  an heroic nature.    Rauparaha travelled down the coast to Kapiti, and there saw a European  whaling-ship. Here then was another spot to which the white men  resorted, and from which the coveted firearms could be obtained. The  Maori at once made up his mind to remove his whole tribe thither, and  thus place them in as good a situation as that of the Ngapuhi at the Bay  of Islands. How the migration was effected--with what blending of  statecraft, heroism, treachery, and cruelty--is a subject which does not  come within the purview of a history of the Church. Suffice it to say  that, at the date to which our narrative has now arrived, Rauparaha was  securely settled in the island fastness of Kapiti, while his Ngatitoas  had their habitations on the mainland opposite. They had ravaged the  south of the island, as the Ngapuhi under Hongi had devastated the  north; and Rauparaha was the most powerful and influential personage in  New Zealand, except--Henry Williams. And now the two powers had met, for  the young men who had arrived at Paihia were none other than the son and  the nephew of Rauparaha, and the cause of their coming was due to the  forgotten slave Ripahau himself.    This seemingly insignificant person had reached Otaki in the new  territory of the Ngatitoas some three years before. There he had met  with Rauparaha's son, Tamihana, a young man who was sick at heart of his  father's violent ways.

Thus the rights of property are  united with the rights of person, and placed on the same ground by the  fifth amendment to the Constitution, which provides that no person  shall be deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process  of law. And an act of Congress which deprives a citizen of the United  States of his liberty or property, merely because he came himself or  brought his property into a particular Territory of the United States,  and who had committed no offence against the laws, could hardly be  dignified with the name of due process of law.    So, too, it will hardly be contended that Congress could by law  quarter a soldier in a house in a Territory without the consent of the  owner, in time of peace; nor in time of war, but in a manner  prescribed by law. Nor could they by law forfeit the property of a  citizen in a Territory who was convicted of treason, for a longer  period than the life of the person convicted; nor take private  property for public use without just compensation.    The powers over person and property of which we speak are not only not  granted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are  forbidden to exercise them. And this prohibition is not confined to  the States, but the words are general, and extend to the whole  territory over which the Constitution gives it power to legislate,  including those portions of it remaining under Territorial Government,  as well as that covered by States. It is a total absence of power  everywhere within the dominion of the United States, and places the  citizens of a Territory, so far as these rights are concerned, on the  same footing with citizens of the States, and guards them as firmly  and plainly against any inroads which the General Government might  attempt, under the plea of implied or incidental powers. And if  Congress itself cannot do this--if it is beyond the powers conferred  on the Federal Government--it will be admitted, we presume, that it  could not authorize a Territorial Government to exercise them. It  could confer no power on any local Government, established by its  authority, to violate the provisions of the Constitution.    It seems, however, to be supposed, that there is a difference between  property in a slave and other property, and that different rules may  be applied to it in expounding the Constitution of the United States.  And the laws and usages of nations, and the writings of eminent  jurists upon the relation of master and slave and their mutual rights  and duties, and the powers which Governments may exercise over it,  have been dwelt upon in the argument.    But in considering the question before us, it must be borne in mind  that there is no law of nations standing between the people of the  United States and their Government, and interfering with their  relation to each other. The powers of the Government, and the rights  of the citizen under it, are positive and practical regulations  plainly written down. The people of the United States have delegated  to it certain enumerated powers, and forbidden it to exercise others.  It has no power over the person or property of a citizen but what the  citizens of the United States have granted. And no laws or usages of  other nations, or reasoning of statesmen or jurists upon the relations  of master and slave, can enlarge the powers of the Government, or take  from the citizens the rights they have reserved. And if the  Constitution recognises the right of property of the master in a  slave, and makes no distinction between that description of property  and other property owned by a citizen, no tribunal, acting under the  authority of the United States, whether it be legislative, executive,  or judicial, has a right to draw such a distinction, or deny to it the  benefit of the provisions and guarantees which have been provided for  the protection of private property against the encroachments of the  Government.    Now, as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, upon  a different point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and  expressly affirmed in the Constitution. The right to traffic in it,  like an ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guarantied  to the citizens of the United States, in every State that might desire  it, for twenty years. And the Government in express terms is pledged  to protect it in all future time, if the slave escapes from his  owner. This is done in plain words--too plain to be misunderstood. And  no word can be found in the Constitution which gives Congress a  greater power over slave property, or which entitles property of that  kind to less protection than property of any other description. The  only power conferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding  and protecting the owner in his rights.    Upon these considerations, it is the opinion of the court that the act  of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning  property of this kind in the territory of the United States north of  the line therein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and  is therefore void; and that neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his  family, were made free by being carried into this territory; even if  they had been carried there by the owner, with the intention of  becoming a permanent resident.    We have so far examined the case, as it stands under the Constitution  of the United States, and the powers thereby delegated to the Federal  Government.    But there is another point in the case which depends on State power  and State law. And it is contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that  he is made free by being taken to Rock Island, in the State of  Illinois, independently of his residence in the territory of the  United States; and being so made free, he was not again reduced to a  state of slavery by being brought back to Missouri.    Our notice of this part of the case will be very brief; for the  principle on which it depends was decided in this court, upon much  consideration, in the case of Strader et al. _v._ Graham, reported in  10th Howard, 82. In that case, the slaves had been taken from Kentucky  to Ohio, with the consent of the owner, and afterwards brought back to  Kentucky. And this court held that their _status_ or condition, as  free or slave, depended upon the laws of Kentucky, when they were  brought back into that State, and not of Ohio; and that this court had  no jurisdiction to revise the judgment of a State court upon its own  laws. This was the point directly before the court, and the decision  that this court had not jurisdiction turned upon it, as will be seen  by the report of the case.    So in this case. As Scott was a slave when taken into the State of  Illinois by his owner, and was there held as such, and brought back in  that character, his _status_, as free or slave, depended on the laws  of Missouri, and not of Illinois.    It has, however, been urged in the argument, that by the laws of  Missouri he was free on his return, and that this case, therefore,  cannot be governed by the case of Strader et al. _v._ Graham, where it  appeared, by the laws of Kentucky, that the plaintiffs continued to be  slaves on their return from Ohio. But whatever doubts or opinions may,  at one time, have been entertained upon this subject, we are  satisfied, upon a careful examination of all the cases decided in the  State courts of Missouri referred to, that it is now firmly settled by  the decisions of the highest court in the State, that Scott and his  family upon their return were not free, but were, by the laws of  Missouri, the property of the defendant; and that the Circuit Court of  the United States had no jurisdiction, when, by the laws of the State,  the plaintiff was a slave, and not a citizen.    Moreover, the plaintiff, it appears, brought a similar action against  the defendant in the State court of Missouri, claiming the freedom of  himself and his family upon the same grounds and the same evidence  upon which he relies in the case before the court. The case was  carried before the Supreme Court of the State; was fully argued there;  and that court decided that neither the plaintiff nor his family were  entitled to freedom, and were still the slaves of the defendant; and  reversed the judgment of the inferior State court, which had given a  different decision. If the plaintiff supposed that this judgment of  the Supreme Court of the State was erroneous, and that this court had  jurisdiction to revise and reverse it, the only mode by which he could  legally bring it before this court was by writ of error directed to  the Supreme Court of the State, requiring it to transmit the record to  this court. If this had been done, it is too plain for argument that  the writ must have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this  court. The case of Strader and others _v._ Graham is directly in  point; and, indeed, independent of any decision, the language of the  25th section of the act of 1789 is too clear and precise to admit of  controversy.    But the plaintiff did not pursue the mode prescribed by law for  bringing the judgment of a State court before this court for revision,  but suffered the case to be remanded to the inferior State court,  where it is still continued, and is, by agreement of parties, to await  the judgment of this court on the point. All of this appears on the  record before us, and by the printed report of the case.    And while the case is yet open and pending in the inferior State  court, the plaintiff goes into the Circuit Court of the United States,  upon the same case and the same evidence, and against the same party,  and proceeds to judgment, and then brings here the same case from the  Circuit Court, which the law would not have permitted him to bring  directly from the State court. And if this court takes jurisdiction  in this form, the result, so far as the"]]]
