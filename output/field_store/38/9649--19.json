Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, should have a  DIAL, of about twelve inches diameter, placed over the kitchen  fireplace, carefully regulated to keep time exactly with the clock in  the hall or dining-parlour; with a frame on one side, containing A TASTE  TABLE of the peculiarities of the master's palate, and the particular  rules and orders of his kitchen; and, on the other side, of the REWARDS  given to those who attend to them, and for long and faithful service.    In small families, where a dinner is seldom given, a great deal of  preparation is required, and the preceding day must be devoted to the  business of the kitchen.    On these occasions a _char-woman_ is often employed to do the dirty  work. Ignorant persons often hinder you more than they help you. We  advise a cook to be hired to assist to dress the dinner: this would be  very little more expense, and the work got through with much more  comfort in the kitchen and credit to the parlour.    When you have a very large entertainment to prepare, get your soups and  sauces, forcemeats, &c. ready the day before, and read the 7th chapter  of our _Rudiments of Cookery_. Many made dishes may also be prepared the  day before they are to go to table; but do not dress them _quite enough_  the first day, that they may not be _over_-done by warming up again.    Prepare every thing you can the day before the dinner, and order every  thing else to be sent in early in the morning; if the tradesmen forget  it, it will allow you time to send for it.    The pastry, jellies, &c. you may prepare while the broths are doing:  then truss your game and poultry, and shape your collops, cutlets, &c.,  and trim them neatly; cut away all flaps and gristles, &c. Nothing  should appear on table but what has indisputable pretensions to be  eaten!    Put your made dishes in plates, and arrange them upon the dresser in  regular order. Next, see that your roasts and boils are all nicely  trimmed, trussed, &c. and quite ready for the spit or the pot.    Have your vegetables neatly cut, pared, picked, and clean washed in the  colander: provide a tin dish, with partitions, to hold your fine herbs:  onions and shallots, parsley, thyme, tarragon, chervil, and burnet,  minced _very fine_; and lemon-peel grated, or cut thin, and chopped very  small: pepper and salt ready mixed, and your spice-box and salt-cellar  always ready for action: that every thing you may want may be at hand  for your stove-work, and not be scampering about the kitchen in a  whirlpool of confusion, hunting after these trifles while the dinner is  waiting.    In one drawer under your SPICE-BOX keep ready ground, in well-stopped  bottles, the several spices separate; and also that mixture of them  which is called \"_ragout powder_\" (No. 457 or No. 460): in another, keep  your dried and powdered sweet, savoury, and soup herbs, &c. and a set of  weights and scales: you may have a third drawer, containing flavouring  essences, &c. an invaluable auxiliary in finishing soups and sauces.  (See the account of the \"MAGAZINE OF TASTE,\" or \"SAUCE-BOX,\" No. 462.)    Have also ready some THICKENING, made of the best white flour sifted,  mixed with soft water with a wooden spoon till it is the consistence of  thick batter, a bottle of plain BROWNING (No. 322), some strained  lemon-juice, and some good glaze, or PORTABLE soup (No. 252).    \"Nothing can be done in perfection which must be done in a hurry:\"[63-*]  therefore, if you wish the dinner to be sent up to please your master  and mistress, and do credit to yourself, be punctual; take care that as  soon as the _clock strikes_, the _dinner-bell rings_: this shows the  establishment to be orderly, is extremely gratifying to the master and  his guests, and is most praiseworthy in the attendants.    But remember, you cannot obtain this desirable reputation without good  management in every respect. If you wish to ensure ease and independence  in the latter part of your life, you must not be unwilling to pay the  price for which only they can be obtained, and earn them by a diligent  and faithful[64-*] performance of the duties of your station in your  young days, which, if you steadily persevere in, you may depend upon  ultimately receiving the reward your services deserve.    All duties are reciprocal: and if you hope to receive favour, endeavour  to deserve it by showing yourself fond of obliging, and grateful when  obliged; such behaviour will win regard, and maintain it: enforce what  is right, and excuse what is wrong.    Quiet, steady perseverance is the only spring which you can safely  depend upon for infallibly promoting your progress on the road to  independence.    If your employers do not immediately appear to be sensible of your  endeavours to contribute your utmost to their comfort and interest, be  not easily discouraged. _Persevere_, and do all in your power to MAKE  YOURSELF USEFUL.    Endeavour to promote the comfort of every individual in the family; let  it be manifest that you are desirous to do rather more than is required  of you, than less than your duty: they merit little who perform merely  what would be exacted. If you are desired to help in any business which  may not strictly belong to your department, undertake it cheerfully,  patiently, and conscientiously.    The foregoing advice has been written with an honest desire to augment  the comfort of those in the kitchen, who will soon find that the  ever-cheering reflection of having done their duty to the utmost of  their ability, is in itself, with a Christian spirit, a never-failing  source of comfort in all circumstances and situations, and that      \"VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [46-*] A chapter of advice to cooks will, we hope, be found as useful as  it is original: all we have on this subject in the works of our  predecessors, is the following; \"I shall strongly recommend to all cooks  of either sex, to keep their stomachs free from strong liquors till  _after_ dinner, and their noses from snuff.\"--_Vide_ CLERMONT'S  _Professed Cook_, p. 30, 8vo.

[55-+] Many COOKS miss excellent opportunities of making themselves  independent, by their idleness, in refusing any place, however  profitable, &c. if there is not a _kitchen maid_ kept to wait upon them.    There are many invalids who require a good cook, and as (after reading  this book they will understand how much) their comfort and effective  existence depends on their food being properly prepared, will willingly  pay handsome wages, (who would not rather pay the cook than the doctor?)  but have so little work in the kitchen that one person may do it all  with the utmost ease, without injury to her health; which is not the  case in a large family, where the poor cook is roasting and stewing all  day, and is often deprived of her rest at night. No artists have greater  need to \"_make hay while the sun shines_,\" and timely provide for the  infirmities of age. Who will hire a superannuated servant? If she has  saved nothing to support herself, she must crawl to the workhouse.    It is melancholy to find, that, according to the authority of a certain  great French author, \"cooks, half stewed and half roasted, when unable  to work any longer, generally retire to some unknown corner, and die in  forlornness and want.\"--BLACKWOOD'S _Edin.

The flesh of most full-grown quadrupeds is  in highest season during the first months of winter, after having  enjoyed the advantage of the abundance of fresh summer food. Its flavour  then begins to be injured by the turnips, &c. given as winter food; and  in spring, it gets lean from deficiency of food. Although beef and  mutton are never absolutely out of season, or not fit for the table,  they are best in November, December, and January. Pork is absolutely  bad, except during the winter.\"--_Supplement to the Edin. Ency. Brit._  p. 328.

We  had been together for two years, and now I was leaving the fish patrol  in order to go back and finish my education. I had earned and saved  money to put me through three years at the high school, and though the  beginning of the term was several months away, I intended doing a lot  of studying for the entrance examinations.    My belongings were packed snugly in a sea-chest, and I was all ready  to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil  Partington arrived in Benicia. The _Reindeer_ was needed immediately  for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run  straight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was to live with  his family while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I  should not put my chest aboard and come along.    So the chest went aboard, and in the middle of the afternoon we  hoisted the _Reindeer's_ big mainsail and cast off. It was tantalizing  fall weather. The sea-breeze, which had blown steadily all summer, was  gone, and in its place were capricious winds and murky skies which  made the time of arriving anywhere extremely problematical. We started  on the first of the ebb, and as we slipped down the Carquinez Straits,  I looked my last for some time upon Benicia and the bight at Turner's  Shipyard, where we had besieged the _Lancashire Queen_, and had  captured Big Alec, the King of the Greeks. And at the mouth of the  Straits I looked with not a little interest upon the spot where a few  days before I should have drowned but for the good that was in the  nature of Demetrios Contos.    A great wall of fog advanced across San Pablo Bay to meet us, and in a  few minutes the _Reindeer_ was running blindly through the damp  obscurity. Charley, who was steering, seemed to have an instinct for  that kind of work. How he did it, he himself confessed that he did not  know; but he had a way of calculating winds, currents, distance, time,  drift, and sailing speed that was truly marvellous.    \"It looks as though it were lifting,\" Neil Partington said, a couple  of hours after we had entered the fog. \"Where do you say we are,  Charley?\"    Charley looked at his watch. \"Six o'clock, and three hours more of  ebb,\" he remarked casually.    \"But where do you say we are?\" Neil insisted.    Charley pondered a moment, and then answered, \"The tide has edged us  over a bit out of our course, but if the fog lifts right now, as it is  going to lift, you'll find we're not more than a thousand miles off  McNear's Landing.\"    \"You might be a little more definite by a few miles, anyway,\" Neil  grumbled, showing by his tone that he disagreed.    \"All right, then,\" Charley said, conclusively, \"not less than a  quarter of a mile, not more than a half.\"    The wind freshened with a couple of little puffs, and the fog thinned  perceptibly.    \"McNear's is right off there,\" Charley said, pointing directly into  the fog on our weather beam.    The three of us were peering intently in that direction, when the  _Reindeer_ struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill. We ran  forward, and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of a  short, chunky mast. She had collided, head on, with a Chinese junk  lying at anchor.    At the moment we arrived forward, five Chinese, like so many bees,  came swarming out of the little 'tween-decks cabin, the sleep still in  their eyes.    Leading them came a big, muscular man, conspicuous for his pock-marked  face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head. It was  Yellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal  shrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at that time, had nearly sunk  the _Reindeer_, as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of  navigation.    \"What d'ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway  without a horn a-going?\" Charley cried hotly.    \"Mean?\" Neil calmly answered. \"Just take a look--that's what he  means.\"    Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil's finger, and we saw  the open amid-ships of the junk, half filled, as we found on closer  examination, with fresh-caught shrimps. Mingled with the shrimps were  myriads of small fish, from a quarter of an inch upwards in size.  Yellow Handkerchief had lifted the trap-net at high-water slack, and,  taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog, had boldly  been lying by, waiting to lift the net again at low-water slack.    \"Well,\" Neil hummed and hawed, \"in all my varied and extensive  experience as a fish patrolman, I must say this is the easiest capture  I ever made. What'll we do with them, Charley?\"    \"Tow the junk into San Rafael, of course,\" came the answer. Charley  turned to me. \"You stand by the junk, lad, and I'll pass you a towing  line. If the wind doesn't fail us, we'll make the creek before the  tide gets too low, sleep at San Rafael, and arrive in Oakland  to-morrow by midday.\"    So saying, Charley and Neil returned to the _Reindeer_ and got under  way, the junk towing astern. I went aft and took charge of the prize,  steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with large,  diamond-shaped holes, through which the water rushed back and forth.    By now the last of the fog had vanished, and Charley's estimate of our  position was confirmed by the sight of McNear's Landing a short  half-mile away. Following along the west shore, we rounded Point Pedro  in plain view of the Chinese shrimp villages, and a great to-do was  raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the familiar  fish patrol sloop.    The wind, coming off the land, was rather puffy and uncertain, and it  would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger. San Rafael  Creek, up which we had to go to reach the town, and turn over our  prisoners to the authorities, ran through wide-stretching marshes, and  was difficult to navigate on a falling tide, while at low tide it was  impossible to navigate at all. So, with the tide already half-ebbed,  it was necessary for us to make time. This the heavy junk prevented  lumbering along behind and holding the _Reindeer_ back by just so much  dead weight.    \"Tell those coolies to get up that sail\" Charley finally called to me.  \"We don't want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the night.\"    I repeated the order to Yellow Handkerchief, who mumbled it huskily to  his men. He was suffering from a bad cold, which doubled him up in  convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and bloodshot. This  made him more evil-looking than ever, and when he glared viciously at  me, I remembered with a shiver the close shave I had had with him at  the time of his previous arrest.    His crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards, and the strange,  outlandish sail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the air.  We were sailing on the wind, and when Yellow Handkerchief flattened  down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line went slack. Fast  as the _Reindeer_ could sail, the junk outsailed her; and to avoid  running her down I hauled a little closer on the wind. But the junk  likewise outpointed, and in a couple of minutes I was abreast of the  _Reindeer_ and to windward. The tow-line had now tautened, at right  angles to the two boats and the predicament was laughable.    \"Cast off!\" I shouted.    Charley hesitated.    \"It's all right,\" I added. \"Nothing can happen. We'll make the creek on  this tack, and you'll be right behind me all the way up to San  Rafael.\"    At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent one of his men  forward to haul in the line. In the gathering darkness I could just  make out the mouth of San Rafael Creek, and by the time we entered it  I could barely see its banks. The _Reindeer_ was fully five minutes  astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow,  winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to  fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a  sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers  pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put  my hand on it.    Yellow Handkerchief was the one I feared, and that he knew it and made  use of it, subsequent events will show. He was sitting a few feet away  from me, on what then happened to be the weather side of the junk. I  could scarcely see the outlines of his form, but I soon became  convinced that he was slowly, very slowly, edging closer to me. I  watched him carefully. Steering with my left hand, I slipped my right  into my pocket and got hold of the revolver.    I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about to  order him back--the words were trembling on the tip of my tongue--when  I was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped  through the air upon me from the lee side. It was one of the crew. He  pinioned my right arm so that I could not withdraw my hand from my  pocket, and at the same time clapped his other hand over my mouth. Of  course, I could have struggled away from him and freed my hand or  gotten my mouth clear so that I might cry an alarm, but in a trice  Yellow Handkerchief was on top of me.    I struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk, while my  legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what I  afterward found out to be a cotton shirt. Then I was left lying in the  bottom. Yellow Handkerchief took the tiller, issuing his orders in  whispers; and from our position at the time, and from the alteration  of the sail, which I could dimly make out above me as a blot against  the stars, I knew the junk was being headed into the mouth of a small  slough which emptied at that point into San"]]]
