Je me flattais que ces Ministres qui s'etaient toujours  si bien entendus avec les miens pour etablir entre nos deux  Gouvernements, cette heureuse _entente cordiale_ qui est la base du  repos du monde et de la prosperite de nos pays, continueraient encore  longtemps a l'entretenir, et a la consolider de plus en plus. Cet  espoir est decu!![33] Il faut s'y resigner; mais je suis empresse  d'assurer votre Majeste, que quelque soit son nouveau Ministere, celui  qui m'entoure aujourd'hui, et que je desire, et que j'espere conserver  longtemps, n'omettra aucun effort pour cultiver et maintenir cet  heureux accord qu'il est si evidemment dans notre interet commun de  conserver intact.    Dans de telles circonstances, il me devient doublement precieux d'etre  uni a votre Majeste et au Prince Albert par tant de liens, et qu'il se  soit forme entre nous cet attachement mutuel, cette affection et cette  confiance, qui sont au dessus et independants de toute consideration  politique; mais qui pourront toujours plus ou moins exercer  une influence salutaire sur l'action et la marche de nos deux  Gouvernements. Aussi, je le dis a votre Majeste et a son Epoux avec  un entier abandon, j'ai besoin de compter sur cette assistance  occasionnelle, et j'y compte entierement en vous demandant d'avoir la  meme confiance de mon cote, et en vous repetant que cette confiance ne  sera pas plus decue dans l'avenir, qu'elle ne l'a ete dans le passe.    Votre Majeste me permettra d'offrir ici au Prince Albert l'expression  de ma vive et sincere amitie. Je la prie aussi de recevoir celle de  l'inviolable attachement avec lequel je suis, Madame ma tres chere  S[oe]ur, de votre Majeste, le bon Frere et bien fidele Ami,    LOUIS PHILIPPE R.

The Queen fully understands the motives which guide Lord John in  using every effort to ensure the success of the great measure which is  impending before he undertakes to form a Government.    The Queen sees from Lord John's second letter that he has taken a copy  of Sir R. Peel's letter of the 15th to her. As she does not feel to  have been authorised to allow this, the Queen hopes that in case Sir  Robert should have an objection to it Lord John will not retain the  copy.        [Footnote 34: It is printed in the _Annual Register_, 1846, p.      17. Lord John considered the temporary suspension or repeal      of duties, with the prospect of their re-imposition, open to      grave objections.]          [Pageheading: INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES]      _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _18th December 1845._    Lord John Russell returned at five this evening, and informed  the Queen that after considerable discussion, and after a full  consideration of his position, _he will undertake to form a  Government_.    As at present arranged, the Council is to be on Monday; the Queen much  wishing to have a parting interview with Sir R. Peel, however painful  it will be to her, wishes Sir Robert Peel to inform her when he thinks  it best to come down here.[35]        [Footnote 35: Lord John Russell, however, found insuperable      difficulties in forming the Cabinet; and, to quote Disraeli,      \"handed back with courtesy the poisoned chalice to Sir      Robert.\"]          [Pageheading: GREY AND PALMERSTON]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _20th December 1845._    (_12 o'clock._)    We just saw Lord John Russell, who came in order to explain why he had  to give up the task of forming a Government. He had written to all his  former colleagues to join him in his attempt, amongst others to Lord  Grey, who answered, \"that he could only belong to a Government which  pledged itself to the principle of absolute free trade and abolition  of all protection; that he had his own views upon the sugar question  (as to which he advocated the admission of slave labour) and upon  the Irish question (as to which his principle was to establish entire  religious equality); that he hoped that in the formation of a new  Government no personal considerations should stand in the way of a  full attention to public Duty.\"    Lord John replied that he advocated free trade, but as the immediate  question before them was the _Corn Laws_, he thought it wiser not to  complicate this by other declarations which would produce a good deal  of animosity; that the sugar question and Ireland might be discussed  in Cabinet when circumstances required it; that he agreed entirely in  the last sentence.    After this Lord Grey declared himself quite satisfied. Lord John  considered now with his colleagues the peculiar measure to be  proposed, and Mr Baring thought he could arrange a financial scheme  which would satisfy Lord Lansdowne's demands for relief to the landed  interest. They all felt it their duty to answer the Queen's call upon  them, though they very much disliked taking office under such peculiar  difficulties. Now Lord John undertook to apportion the different  offices. He saw Lord Palmerston, and told him that the Queen had some  apprehension that his return to the Foreign Office might cause great  alarm in other countries, and particularly in France, and that this  feeling was still more strongly manifested in the city; whether under  these circumstances he would prefer some other office--for instance,  the Colonies? Lord Palmerston declared that he was not at all anxious  for office, and should much regret that his accession should in any  way embarrass Lord John; that he was quite prepared to support him out  of office, but that his taking another department than his former one  would be a public recognition of the most unjust accusations that  had been brought against him; that he had evinced throughout a long  official life his disposition for peace, and only in one instance  broke with France;[36] that that matter was gone by, and that nobody  had stronger conviction of the necessity to keep in amity with that  Power than himself. Upon this Lord John said that he could not form a  Government without him, and showed himself quite satisfied with Lord  Palmerston's declaration.        [Footnote 36: In reference to affairs in Syria in 1840.]    Suddenly Lord Grey, who had heard of this, cried out: \"This was an  infringement of their compact\"; that no _personal_ consideration  should interfere with the discharge of public duty, and that he must  decline entering the Government, as he considered Lord Palmerston's  return to the Foreign Office as fraught with danger to the peace  of Europe. Lord John could not, under these circumstances, form a  Government. He read to us a long letter from Lord Grey, written with  the intention that it should be seen by the Queen, in which Lord  Grey enters more fully into his motives, and finishes by saying  that therefore _he_ was not answerable for the failure to form an  Administration.[37]        [Footnote 37: Lord Grey's attitude was condemned by Macaulay      in a letter to a Mr Macfarlan, who unwisely communicated it to      the Press.]    Lord John gave the Queen a written statement[38] of the causes which  induced him to relinquish the Government, and of the position he means  to assume in Parliament. (He is most anxious that Sir R. Peel should  re-enter and successfully carry his measures.)        [Footnote 38: Printed in _Annual Register_, 1846, p. 20.]    The arrangements Lord John had contemplated have been--      Lord PALMERSTON,      _Foreign Secretary_.    Lord GREY,            _Colonial Secretary_.    Sir GEORGE GREY,      _Home Secretary_.    (Sir George was anxious later to retire from Parliament, and willing  to go as Governor-General to Canada.)      Mr BARING,            _Chancellor of the Exchequer_.    Lord CLARENDON,       _President of the Board of Trade_.    (The Vice-Presidency was to have been offered to his brother, Mr  Villiers, but finally, by his advice, to Mr Cobden!! (Lord Grey wanted  Mr Cobden to be in the Cabinet!!!) This Lord John thought quite out of  the question.)      Lord LANSDOWNE,       _President of the Council_.          [Pageheading: CHIVALROUS ATTITUDE OF PEEL]    [Pageheading: PEEL RESUMES OFFICE]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _20th December 1845._    (_4 o'clock_ P.M.)    We saw Sir Robert Peel, who had been apprised by Sir James Graham (to  whom Lord John Russell had written) of what had passed. He was much  affected, and expressed his concern at the failure of Lord John to  form a Government, seemed hurt at Lord John's not having shown more  confidence in the integrity of his (Sir Robert Peel's) motives. He  would have supported Lord John in _any_ measure which he should have  thought fit to introduce, and many would have followed his example. He  blamed the want of deference shown to the Queen, by not answering  her call with more readiness; he said it was quite new and  unconstitutional for a man to take a week before he undertook to form  a Government, and to pass that time in discussion with other people,  to whom the Sovereign had not yet committed the task; and he had been  certain it would end so, when so many people were consulted. He in  1834 had been called from Italy, had travelled with all haste and  had gone straight to the King,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#16)"],[1,"res;    Quos prece vel pretio domant corruptores,    Sic prætaxatos referunt artaxata mores.    An English _nation_ or set of students of the Faculty of Arts at Paris  existed in 1169; after 1430 the name was changed to the German nation.  Besides the students from the French provinces subject to the English,  as Poictou, Guienne, &c, it included the English, Scottish, Irish,  Poles, Germans, &c. --_Encyc. Brit._ John of Salisbury (born 1110) says  that he was twelve years studying at Paris on his own account. Thomas a  Becket, as a young man, studied at Paris. Giraldus Cambrensis (born  1147) went to Paris for education; so did Alexander Neckham (died 1227).  Henry says,      \"The English, in particular, were so numerous, that they occupied    several schools or colleges; and made so distinguished a figure by    their genius and learning, as well as by their generous manner of    living, that they attracted the notice of all strangers. This    appears from the following verses, describing the behaviour of a    stranger on his first arrival in Paris, composed by Negel Wircker,    an English student there, A.D. 1170:--        The stranger dress'd, the city first surveys,      A church he enters, to his God he prays.      Next to the schools he hastens, each he views,      With care examines, anxious which to chuse.      The English most attract his prying eyes,      Their manners, words, and looks, pronounce them wise.      Theirs is the open hand, the bounteous mind;      Theirs solid sense, with sparkling wit combin'd.      Their graver studies jovial banquets crown,      Their rankling cares in flowing bowls they drown.[58]    Montpelier was another University whither Englishmen resorted, and is to  be remembered by us if only for the memory of Andrew Borde, M.D., some  bits of whose quaintness are in the notes to Russell in the present  volume.    Padua is to be noted for Pace's sake. He is supposed to have been born  in 1482.    Later, the custom of sending young noblemen and gentlemen to Italy--to  travel, not to take a degree--was introduced, and Ascham's condemnation  of it, when no tutor accompanied the youths, is too well known to need  quoting. The Italians' saying, _Inglese Italianato è un diabolo  incarnato_, sums it up.[59]        [Headnote: MONASTIC AND CATHEDRAL SCHOOLS.]    5. _Monastic and Cathedral Schools._ Herbert Losing, Bp. of Thetford,  afterwards Norwich, between 1091 and 1119, in his 37th Letter restores  his schools at Thetford to Dean Bund, and directs that no other schools  be opened there.    Tanner (_Not. Mon._ p. xx. ed. Nasmith), when mentioning \"the use  and advantage of these Religious houses\"--under which term \"are  comprehended, cathedral and collegiate churches, abbies, priories,  colleges, hospitals, preceptories (Knights Templars' houses), and  frieries\"--says,      \"Secondly, They were schools of learning & education; for every    convent had one person or more appointed for this purpose; and all    the neighbours that desired it, might have their children taught    grammar and church musick without any expence to them.[60]      In the nunneries also young women were taught to work, and to read    English, and sometimes Latin also. So that not only the lower rank    of people, who could not pay for their learning, but most of the    noblemen and gentlemen's daughters were educated in those    places.\"[61]        [Headnote: LYDGATE'S TRICKS AT SCHOOL.]    As Lydgate (born at Lydgate in Suffolk, six or seven miles from  Newmarket) was ordained subdeacon in the Benedictine monastery of Bury  St Edmunds in 1389[62], he was probably sent as a boy to a monastic  school. At any rate, as he sketches his early escapades--apple-stealing,  playing truant, &c.,--for us in his _Testament_[63], I shall quote the  youth's bit of the poem here:--      [Line numbers in the following selections were added by the    transcriber for use with sidenotes.]      Harleian MS. 2255, fol. 60.

Once, though, made a scholar and monk there, and sent by the  Monastery to the University, the workman's, if not the ploughman's, son,  might rule nobles and sit by kings, nay, beard them to their face.  Thomas a Becket, himself the son of independent[[63a]] parents, was sent  to be brought up in the \"religious house of the Canons of Merton.\"    In 1392 the writer of Piers Plowman's Crede sketches the then state of  things thus:      Now mot ich soutere hys sone · seten to schole,    And ich a beggeres brol · on the book lerne,    And worth to a writere · and with a lorde dwelle,    Other falsly to a frere · the fend for to serven;                    4    So of that beggares brol · a [bychop[64]] shal worthen,    Among the peres of the lond · prese to sytten,    And lordes sones[65] lowly · to tho losels alowte,    Knyghtes crouketh hem to · and cruccheth ful lowe;                   8    And his syre a soutere · y-suled in grees,    His teeth with toylyng of lether · tatered as a sawe.
