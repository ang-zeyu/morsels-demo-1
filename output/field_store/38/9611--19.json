[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#16)"],[1," this description  to a certain extent. Even at Jeddah Christians were only just tolerated  before the War, and I found it advisable, when exploring its tortuous  bazars, to wear a tarboosh, which earned me the respectful salutations  then accorded to a Turk. The indigenous townsfolk of Jeddah are the  \"meanest\" set of Moslems I have ever met--I use the epithet in its  American sense, as indicating a blend of currishness and crabbedness.  They cringed to the Turk when the braver Arabs of the south were  hammering the oppressor in Asir and Yamen, but, like pariahs, were ready  to fall on them and their women and children when they had surrendered  after a gallant struggle, overwhelmed by an intensive bombardment from  the sea. The alien Moslems resident in Jeddah--especially the  Indians--are not a bad lot, but there is an atmosphere of intolerance  brooding over the whole place which even affects Jeddah harbour. I  remember being shipmate in 1913 with some eight hundred pilgrims from  Aden and the southern ports of the Red Sea. As we were discharging them  off Jeddah, a plump and respectable Aden merchant whom I knew by sight,  but who did not know me in the guise I then wore, was gazing in rapt  enthusiasm at sun-scorched Jeddah, which, against the sterile country  beyond, looked like a stale bride-cake on a dust heap. \"A sacred land,\"  he crooned. \"A blessed land where pigs and Christians cannot live.\"  Incidentally he made a very good living out of Christians and was  actually carrying his gear in a pigskin valise.    At the same time, it is absurd for missionaries to aver of Christians at  Jeddah that \"even those who die in the city are buried on an island at  sea.\" The Christian cemetery lies to the south of the town (we had to  dislodge the Turks from it with shrapnel during the fighting), and the  only island is a small coral reef just big enough to support the ruins  of a nondescript tenement once used for quarantine. No one could be  buried there without the aid of dynamite and a cold chisel. Presumably  missionary report has confused Jeddah with the smaller pilgrim-port of  Yenbo, where there are an island and a sandy spit with a Sheikh's tomb  and a select burial-ground for certain privileged Moslems of the holy  man's family.    The worst indictment of Jeddah (and Mecca too, for that matter) is made  by the pilgrims themselves, though some of it may be exaggerated by men  smarting under the extortions of pilgrim-brokers.    A pious Moslem once averred in my presence that the pilgrim-brokers of  Jeddah were, in themselves, enough to bring a judgment on the place,  and that trenchant opinion is not without foundation. Even to the  unprejudiced eye of a travelled European they present themselves as a  class of blatant bounders battening on the earnest fervour of their  co-religionists and squandering the proceeds on dissipation. I have more  than once been shipmate with a gang of them, and it is at sea that they  cast off such restraint as the critical gaze of other Moslems might  impose. As sumptuous first-class passengers they lounge about the deck  in robes of tussore, rich silks and fancy waistcoats, though out of  deference to their religious prejudice and Christian table-manners they  usually mess by themselves. After dinner they play vociferous poker in  the saloon for cut-throat stakes, evading the captain's veto by using  tastefully designed little fish in translucent colours to represent  heavy cash, and these they invoke from time to time \"for luck.\" As it is  usually sweltering weather, the occidental whiskey-and-soda and the  aromatic _mastic_ of the Levant are much in evidence, and thus three of  Islam's gravest injunctions are set at naught. Their chief fault, to a  broad-minded sportsman, is that they lack self-control, whatever their  luck may be. I have heard an ill-starred gambler bemoaning his losses  with the cries of a stricken animal, and they are still more offensive  as winners.    In Mecca such open breaches of the Islamic code are not tolerated, but  there are other lapses which neither Moslem nor Christian can condone.  It is unfair and out of date to quote Burton's indictment of Meccan  morals, nor have we any right to judge the city by its behaviour soon  after its freedom from the Turkish yoke, when it may have been suffering  from reaction after nervous tension; but, unless the bulk of respectable  Moslem opinion is at fault, there is still much in the administration of  Mecca which cries for reform. Harsh measures may have been necessary at  first, but to maintain a private prison like the _Kabu_ in the state it  is can redound to no ruler's credit, and for prominent officials to  cultivate an \"alluring walk\" and even practise it in the _tawaf_ or  circumambulation of the holy Caaba is beyond comment.    Also the mental standard of officialdom is low, since Syrians of  education and training do not seem to be attracted by the Hejaz service  for long, and local men of position and ability are said to have been  passed over as likely to be formidable as intriguers.    It may be reasonably urged that it is difficult to improvise a Civil  Service on the spur of the moment, and it is permissible to anticipate a  better state of affairs now that war conditions are being superseded. At  the same time it is no use blinking the fact that reform is indicated at  Mecca if that sacred city is to harmonise with its high mission as the  religious centre of the Islamic world, and this affects our numerous  Moslem fellow-countrymen; otherwise the domestic affairs of the Hejaz  are not our concern.    The Hejaz has been very much to the fore lately, and ill-informed or  biassed opinion has developed a tendency to credit it with a greater  part in Arabian and Syrian affairs than it has played, can play, or  should be encouraged to play. Its intolerant tone has, presumably, been  modified by co-operation with the civilised forces of militant  Christendom, but the new kingdom has got to regenerate itself a good  deal before it can cope with wider responsibilities. Emir Feisal is, no  doubt, an enlightened prince, but one swallow does not make a summer,  and Hejazi troops have not yet evolved enough _moral_ to dominate and  control a more formidable breed or be trusted with the peace and  welfare of a more civilised population, especially where there are large  non-Moslem communities. There has been a great deal of nonsense talked  and written about their invincible fighting prowess. They accompanied  the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in much the same way as the jackal is  said to accompany the lion, with a reversionary interest in his kill,  and their faint-hearted fumbling with the Turkish defences outside  Jeddah was obvious to any observer. They are what they have been since  the fiery self-sacrificing enthusiasm of early Islam died down and left  them with the half-warm embers of their racial greed to become  hereditary spoilers of the weak, instinctively shunning a doubtful  fight. In guerilla warfare, leavened by British officers, they have  shown an aptitude for taking advantage of a situation, but they cannot  stand punishment and will not face the prospect of it if they can help  it. Their own leaders knew that well enough when they refrained from  taking Medina by assault, bombardment being out of the question, as  buildings of the utmost sanctity would have been inevitably damaged or  destroyed.    Prince Feisal has, in a published interview with a representative of the  Press, disclaimed all imperialistic ambitions for the Hejaz, but merely  demanded Arab independence in what was once the Ottoman Empire. That  being assured, the new kingdom will be able to devote its energies to  internal affairs, and the excellent impression made by the Hejazi prince  in Europe should be a favourable augury of the future.    The missionary question should be left to the reigning house for  decision; it is not fair to hamper the Hejaz with unnecessary  complications, and to allow active missionary propaganda at a  pilgrim-port like Jeddah is asking for trouble, apart from the flagrant  violation of religious sentiment. Imagine Catholic feeling if an  enterprising Moslem mission were established at Lourdes. Tact and  expediency are just as necessary in religious as in secular affairs--at  least so St. Paul has taught us; but the modern missionary is too apt to  regard these qualities in Christianity as insincerity and the lack of  them in Islam as fanaticism.    South of the Hejaz lies that rather vague area known as Asir. For  geographical purposes we may consider it as the country between two  parallels of latitude drawn through the coastal towns of Lith and  Loheia, with the Red Sea on the west and an ill-defined inland border  merging eastward into the desert plateau of Southern Nejd. Politically,  it is that territory of Western Arabia between the Hejaz and Yamen in  which the Idrisi has more control than anyone since his successful  revolt against the Turks a year or two before the War. In all  probability its northern districts with Lith will go to the Hejaz, and  the southern ones with Loheia to the Idrisi; but Western diplomacy will  be well advised to leave those two rulers to settle it between  themselves and the local population, especially inland, as tribal  boundaries between semi-nomadic and pastoral people are not for  intelligent amateurs to trifle with. Nor should the missionary be  encouraged; Asir is not a suitable field for his activities, and the  trouble he would probably cause is out of all proportion to the good he  could possibly do. The Asiri is a frizzy-haired fanatic with a short  temper and a serious disposition, addicted to sword-play and the  indiscriminate use of firearms. I doubt if he would see the humour of  missionary logic. As for the Idrisi himself, he is a tall, well set up  man of negroid aspect (being of Moorish and Soudani descent), and has  shown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#16)"],[1," them at this pace, my shoe became looser, and as we neared the turnpike  gate it came off.    If Smith had been in his right senses he would have been sensible of  something wrong in my pace, but he was too drunk to notice.    Beyond the turnpike was a long piece of road, upon which fresh stones  had just been laid--large sharp stones, over which no horse could be  driven quickly without risk of danger. Over this road, with one shoe  gone, I was forced to gallop at my utmost speed, my rider meanwhile  cutting into me with his whip, and with wild curses urging me to go  still faster. Of course my shoeless foot suffered dreadfully; the hoof  was broken and split down to the very quick, and the inside was terribly  cut by the sharpness of the stones.    This could not go on; no horse could keep his footing under such  circumstances; the pain was too great. I stumbled, and fell with  violence on both my knees. Smith was flung off by my fall, and, owing to  the speed I was going at, he must have fallen with great force. I soon  recovered my feet and limped to the side of the road, where it was free  from stones. The moon had just risen above the hedge, and by its light  I could see Smith lying a few yards beyond me. He did not rise; he made  one slight effort to do so, and then there was a heavy groan. I could  have groaned, too, for I was suffering intense pain both from my foot  and knees; but horses are used to bear their pain in silence. I uttered  no sound, but I stood there and listened. One more heavy groan from  Smith; but though he now lay in the full moonlight I could see no  motion. I could do nothing for him nor myself, but, oh! how I listened  for the sound of horse, or wheels, or footsteps! The road was not much  frequented, and at this time of the night we might stay for hours before  help came to us. I stood watching and listening. It was a calm, sweet  April night; there were no sounds but a few low notes of a nightingale,  and nothing moved but the white clouds near the moon and a brown owl  that flitted over the hedge. It made me think of the summer nights long  ago, when I used to lie beside my mother in the green pleasant meadow at  Farmer Grey's.          26 How it Ended      It must have been nearly midnight when I heard at a great distance the  sound of a horse's feet. Sometimes the sound died away, then it grew  clearer again and nearer. The road to Earlshall led through woods that  belonged to the earl; the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it  might be some one coming in search of us. As the sound came nearer and  nearer I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little  nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart. I neighed  loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and  men's voices. They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark  figure that lay upon the ground.    One of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it. \"It is Reuben,\" he  said, \"and he does not stir!\"    The other man followed, and bent over him. \"He's dead,\" he said; \"feel  how cold his hands are.\"    They raised him up, but there was no life, and his hair was soaked with  blood. They laid him down again, and came and looked at me. They soon  saw my cut knees.    \"Why, the horse has been down and thrown him! Who would have thought the  black horse would have done that? Nobody thought he could fall. Reuben  must have been lying here for hours! Odd, too, that the horse has not  moved from the place.\"    Robert then attempted to lead me forward. I made a step, but almost fell  again.    \"Halloo! he's bad in his foot as well as his knees. Look here--his hoof  is cut all to pieces; he might well come down, poor fellow! I tell you  what, Ned, I'm afraid it hasn't been all right with Reuben. Just think  of his riding a horse over these stones without a shoe! Why, if he had  been in his right senses he would just as soon have tried to ride him  over the moon. I'm afraid it has been the old thing over again. Poor  Susan! she looked awfully pale when she came to my house to ask if  he had not come home. She made believe she was not a bit anxious, and  talked of a lot of things that might have kept him. But for all that she  begged me to go and meet him. But what must we do? There's the horse to  get home as well as the body, and that will be no easy matter.\"    Then followed a conversation between them, till it was agreed that  Robert, as the groom, should lead me, and that Ned must take the body.  It was a hard job to get it into the dog-cart, for there was no one to  hold Ginger; but she knew as well as I did what was going on, and stood  as still as a stone. I noticed that, because, if she had a fault, it was  that she was impatient in standing.    Ned started off very slowly with his sad load, and Robert came and  looked at my foot again; then he took his handkerchief and bound it  closely round, and so he led me home. I shall never forget that night  walk; it was more than three miles. Robert led me on very slowly, and I  limped and hobbled on as well as I could with great pain. I am sure he  was sorry for me, for he often patted and encouraged me, talking to me  in a pleasant voice.    At last I reached my own box, and had some corn; and after Robert  had wrapped up my knees in wet cloths, he tied up my foot in a bran  poultice, to draw out the heat and cleanse it before the horse-doctor  saw it in the morning, and I managed to get myself down on the straw,  and slept in spite of the pain.    The next day after the farrier had examined my wounds, he said he hoped  the joint was not injured; and if so, I should not be spoiled for work,  but I should never lose the blemish. I believe they did the best to make  a good cure, but it was a long and painful one. Proud flesh, as they  called it, came up in my knees, and was burned out with caustic; and  when at last it was healed, they put a blistering fluid over the front  of both knees to bring all the hair off; they had some reason for this,  and I suppose it was all right.    As Smith's death had been so sudden, and no one was there to see it,  there was an inquest held. The landlord and hostler at the White Lion,  with several other people, gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he  started from the inn. The keeper of the toll-gate said he rode at a hard  gallop through the gate; and my shoe was picked up among the stones, so  that the case was quite plain to them, and I was cleared of all blame.    Everybody pitied Susan. She was nearly out of her mind; she kept saying  over and over again, \"Oh! he was so good--so good! It was all that  cursed drink; why will they sell that cursed drink? Oh Reuben, Reuben!\"  So she went on till after he was buried; and then, as she had no home or  relations, she, with her six little children, was obliged once more to  leave the pleasant home by the tall oak-trees, and go into that great  gloomy Union House.          27 Ruined and Going Downhill      As soon as my knees were sufficiently healed I was turned into a small  meadow for a month or two; no other creature was there; and though I  enjoyed the liberty and the sweet grass, yet I had been so long used to  society that I felt very lonely. Ginger and I had become fast friends,  and now I missed her company extremely. I often neighed when I heard  horses' feet passing in the road, but I seldom got an answer; till one  morning the gate was opened, and who should come in but dear old Ginger.  The man slipped off her halter, and left her there. With a joyful whinny  I trotted up to her; we were both glad to meet, but I soon found that it  was not for our pleasure that she was brought to be with me. Her story  would be too long to tell, but the end of it was that she had been  ruined by hard riding, and was now turned off to see what rest would do.    Lord George was young and would take no warning; he was a hard rider,  and would hunt whenever he could get the chance, quite careless of his  horse. Soon after I left the stable there was a steeplechase, and he  determined to ride. Though the groom told him she was a little strained,  and was not fit for the race, he did not believe it, and on the day of  the race urged Ginger to keep up with the foremost riders. With her high  spirit, she strained herself to the utmost; she came in with the first  three horses, but her wind was touched, besides which he was too heavy  for her, and her back was strained. \"And so,\" she said, \"here we are,  ruined in the prime of our youth and strength, you by a drunkard, and I  by a fool; it is very hard.\" We both felt in ourselves that we were not  what we had been. However, that did not spoil the pleasure we had in  each other's company; we did not gallop about as we once did, but we  used to feed, and lie down together, and stand for hours under one  of the shady lime-trees with our heads close to each other; and so we  passed our time till the family returned from town.    One day we saw the earl come into the meadow, and York was with him.  Seeing who it was, we stood still under our lime-tree, and let them come  up to us. They examined us carefully. The earl seemed much annoyed.    \"There is three hundred pounds flung away for no earthly use,\" said he;  \"but what I care most for is that these horses of my old friend, who  thought they would find a good home with me, are ruined. The mare shall  have a twelve-month's run, and we shall see what that will do for her;  but the black one, he must be sold; 'tis a great pity, but I could not  have knees like these in my stables.\"    \"No, my lord, of course not,\" said York; \"but he might get a place where  appearance is not of much consequence, and still be well treated. I know  a man in Bath, the master of some livery stables, who often wants a  good horse at a low figure; I know he looks well after his horses.  The inquest cleared the horse's character, and your lordship's  recommendation, or"]]]
