From a distance, minke whales might also be mistaken for northern  bottlenosed whales (or any of several other beaked whales with a similar  dorsal fin). They can be distinguished by the differences in head shape,  body color and markings, and behavior, detailed on p. 67.      Distribution    Minke whales are distributed in the polar, temperate, and tropical  waters of the western North Atlantic. They are found from the pack ice  south to at least Anguilla, Lesser Antilles, and the eastern Gulf of  Mexico, though they appear to be most abundant in temperate waters north  of the latitude of New York and are infrequently reported from tropical  waters. At least some of the population migrates to the northern  portions of their range in spring and back south in autumn. They often  approach close to shore and enter river mouths, inlets, and estuaries.    Minke whales arrive along the Canadian coast in May or June. Some  migrate as far north as Hudson Strait, where they remain until the  freeze in October, November, or December. By December the majority of  the population has begun to move to the south, although some animals  remain behind so long as to become entrapped in the ice and die. Spring  and summer concentrations along the Canadian coast correspond to  concentrations of capelin, cod, and herring. Southern concentrations,  also corresponding with concentrations of herring, extend farther  offshore at least to the edges of the Grand Bank. Minke whales also  summer off the south coast of western Greenland, which they probably  reach from waters southwest of Iceland. Minke whales also occur in deep  pelagic waters.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded minke whales can be most readily identified by: 1) their small  size (to just over 30 feet [9.1 m]); 2) the transverse white bands on  the flippers; 3) the yellowish-white baleen plates (up to half the  posteriormost plates may be brown or black), 300-325 per side in number  and having fine white bristles (the plates are up to 4.75 inches [12 cm]  wide at the base and up to 8 inches [20.3 cm] long); and 4) by the 50-70  thin ventral grooves, ending well before the navel, often just even with  the flippers.    [Illustration: Figure 62.--The minke whale, at a maximum length of just  over 30 feet (9.1 m), the smallest baleen whale species of the western  North Atlantic, is distributed in polar, temperate, and tropical waters.  These animals usually have a low, inconspicuous blow and are sometimes  curious enough about boats that they will alter their course to  investigate them. Note the two areas of light gray on the sides of the  body, characteristic of at least Pacific minke whales.

Description    Northern bottlenosed whales reach a length of 32 feet (9.8 m) and are  robust in form. They are characterized by a bulbous forehead, which is  more pronounced on larger animals and most distinctive in adult males,  and by the dolphinlike beak displayed in animals of all sizes and ages,  which is sometimes visible as the animals surface steeply to breathe.    The blowhole is located in an indented area behind the bulbous forehead,  and the blow emanating from it projects upward or slightly forward to a  height of up to 6 feet (1.8 m), is bushy and is visible from a  considerable distance under low wind conditions. The dorsal fin, located  two-thirds of the way back on the back, reaches at least 12 inches (30.5  cm) in height and is distinctly falcate. The dorsal fin may be visible  from a distance of several hundred meters.    Northern bottlenosed whales are usually brownish in color, though the  markings change with age. Smaller animals are a uniform chocolate brown.  Larger animals retain the chocolate brown color on the back but are  often lighter on the sides and the belly and often have irregular  patches or blotches of grayish-white coloration on the back and sides.  Extremely large animals, presumably older males, often have a white  head. The flippers and the undersides of the flukes are uniformly brown  in color.      Natural History Notes    Northern bottlenosed whales often form tightly packed groups of up to 10  or more animals. This species holds the anecdotal record for the longest  dives, having been reported by early whalers to remain submerged over 2  h. They are probably deep divers, feeding primarily on squid (though  they may take fishes as well), and they rarely go in water shallower  than 100 fathoms (183 m).    After a long dive, northern bottlenosed whales will sometimes remain on  the surface for 10 min or more, blowing at regular intervals before  making another dive. After the last blow of a series or when the animals  are startled by a boat, they may show the tail flukes as they begin to  dive. The flukes are not notched on the rear margin.    Northern bottlenosed whales have been observed to show curiosity about  boats, coming to them from a considerable distance. They have also been  observed to \"lobtail,\" raising the tail flukes above the water and  slapping them against the surface, and to jump clear of the water.    In the late 19th century, after stocks of bowhead whales were severely  reduced by overwhaling, northern bottlenosed whales became a prime  target of arctic whalers. They were sought because in addition to whale  oil produced from the body blubber, the forehead of the species yielded  quantities of spermaceti like that obtained from sperm whales.      May Be Confused With    Northern bottlenosed whales have a northerly and deep-water  distribution. Within their range, they may be confused at a distance  with minke whales, with sperm whales, or perhaps with North Sea beaked  whales.    Minke whales (p. 63) have a falcate dorsal fin located in approximately  the same position as that of the northern bottlenosed whale. However,  minke whales have a flathead in front of their two blow holes and are  black to dark gray on the back.    Sperm whales (p. 57) have a squarish head that may somewhat resemble  that of an adult male northern bottlenosed whale. However, there are  numerous characteristics which will permit these species to be  distinguished even from a distance:             NORTHERN       BOTTLENOSED WHALE                   SPERM WHALE                                   BLOW      Low and bushy; projects           Low and bushy, projects    upward from indentation on        obliquely forward from left    top of head.                      side of head; usually less                                      than 8 feet (2.4 m).                                COLORATION      Lighter brown; adults splotched   Brownish gray; body appears    with grayish white;               wrinkled.    body smooth.                                  FLUKES      Rarely notched; seldom raised     Notched; raised on long dive.    on long dive.                                   HEAD      Tapering in younger animals;      Squarish, long, all black;    bulbous in adults;                beakless.    white in older animals; beaked.    A further aid to distinguishing northern bottlenosed and sperm whales at  sea is the fact that the sperm whales that are found in areas where  northern bottlenosed whales are encountered are usually older, larger  males from 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m) long. Northern bottlenosed  whales do not exceed 32 feet (9.8 m).    Northern bottlenosed whales may also be confused with the poorly known  North Sea beaked whale (p. 82). When they can be examined at close  range, however, northern bottlenosed whales should be distinguishable on  the basis of the distinctly bulbous forehead.      Distribution    In the western North Atlantic, northern bottlenosed whales are  restricted to Arctic and north temperate waters, where they most  commonly occur in offshore areas. They have been reported from Davis  Straits and the entrance to Hudson Strait, the Gully southeast of Sable  Island, and as far south as Narragansett Bay, R.I.    In the spring and summer they concentrate near the northern limits of  their range, occasionally visiting deep channels of the Gulf of St.  Lawrence and eastern Newfoundland in summer. During these seasons they  may extend to the edge of the pack ice.    In the fall and winter the bulk of the population migrates"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],[0,"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#16)"],[1,"in the caudal vertebrae.  The application of Etheridge's findings to anoline systematics must  await the completion of his study.    The carination of the scales on the snout _versus_ smooth scales there  seems to be the only significant character given by Bocourt that  distinguishes _A. Nebuloides_ from _A. nebulosus_. The difference in the  color of the throat fan, which is apparent only in living individuals,  is more striking. Obviously more than one species is represented, as is  borne out by the differences in the color of the throat fan and in the  osteology, but there is uncertainty about the correct name for each  species. On the strength of Bocourt's diagnosis of keeled snout scales  in _A. nebuloides_, I am applying that name to the population in Oaxaca  and _A. nebulosus_ to the specimens from Michoacan. As arranged here,  the two species can be distinguished, as follows:         _A. nebulosus._--Dorsal scales only slightly smaller than       the ventral scales; snout scales usually smooth; throat-fan       bright orange in adult males.         _A. nebuloides._--Dorsal scales somewhat larger than the       ventral scales; snout scales having a low keel; throat-fan       pink in adult males.    With respect to geographic distribution, _A. nebulosus_ has been  collected from southern Sinaloa southward to Michoacan. The lizards here  referred to _A. nebuloides_ have been taken only in pine-oak forest on  the mountain slopes near Oaxaca City. Zweifel and Norris (1955:233)  reported anoles with pink throat-fans from southern Sonora; possibly  those specimens are _A. nebuloides_; I have not examined them. I have  seen several preserved specimens from the vicinity of Tehuantepec,  Oaxaca. Although they probably belong to this group, those specimens  differ from both _A. nebulosus_ and _A. nebuloides_ in their larger  size, relatively larger head, and much larger throat fan.    Aside from the minor variation in scutellation, specimens of _Anolis  nebulosus_ from Michoacan vary greatly in coloration. Usually the  females have some form of a broad middorsal pale-colored band. In life  this is dull yellow, tan, or orange. Two females from Dos Aguas are  strikingly different; one (UMMZ 119521) has a broad middorsal orange  stripe that is scalloped laterally and bordered by gray. The other (UMMZ  119081) has a narrow middorsal cream-colored line. Males usually are  unicolor brown or olive-tan; sometimes the middorsal region is darker.  Some individuals have dark cross-bands or chevrons on the dorsum. One  male from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 119080) has a cream-colored lateral stripe.    In Michoacan _Anolis nebulosus_ occurs from sea level to elevations  slightly in excess of 2100 meters, usually in areas of dense cover,  whether this be herbaceous, viney, or woody, ordinarily on the ground as  well as in bushes and trees. One was in a bromeliad growing about ten  meters above the ground. In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley anoles of this  species are most frequently found in the tangled growth along streams.  Above Uruapan they were found in pine-oak forest, and on the Mexican  Plateau between Zamora and Zacapu they were found in a bunch grass-scrub  oak association.      ~Anolis schmidti~ Smith         _Anolis schmidti_ Smith, Publ. Field Mus. Nat. Hist., zool.       ser., 24:21, January 30, 1939.--Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico.         La Placita; San Juan de Lima.    Peters (1954:11) reported on the specimen from La Placita; another was  secured at San Juan de Lima in 1956. The latter (UMMZ 115078) is a male  having a snout-vent length of 43.0 mm. and a tail length of 70.5 mm. The  dorsal ground color is pale tan; there are five pairs of irregular dark  brown dorsolateral blotches. In life the throat fan was pale orange.  These specimens agree with those from Colima described by Duellman  (1958c:10). The distribution of _Anolis schmidti_ seems to be restricted  to the coastal lowlands from Michoacan to Nayarit.      ~Basiliscus vittatus~ Wiegmann         _Basiliscus vittatus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 21:373,       1828.--Mexico.

This species has been found only on the coast and in the low  Tepalcatepec Valley. In the latter area it is restricted to riparian  situations along the larger streams. The lizard is abundant in the  mangrove swamps bordering the brackish lagoons on the coast. In July,  1955, scores of individuals were seen around Estero Pichi at Playa Azul.  Adults, especially the large males, are exceedingly wary and difficult  to collect. At all localities where they were found, the lizards were  most often seen in dense bushes, where they are well camouflaged.  Individuals of all sizes were observed to run across the surface of the  ponds.      ~Iguana iguana rhinolopha~ Wiegmann         _Iguana rhinolopha_ Wiegmann, Herpetologia Mexicana, p. 44,       1834.--Mexico.

Like the preceding species, this lizard is always found near water. It  does not ascend the foothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman, but in the  Balsas Basin it reaches elevations of 800 meters at La Playa. Large  adults are often seen in the large trees making up the gallery forests  along rivers. From high perches the lizards drop into the water with a  terrific splash. Bright green juveniles were abundant in bushes along  the Rio Tepalcatepec in July, 1955.      ~Ctenosaura pectinata~ (Wiegmann)         _Cyclura pectinata_ Wiegmann, Herpetologia Mexicana, p. 42,       1834.--Mexico (by inference).

The record from Uruapan (USNM 10234, collected by Duges) is  doubtful.    These large lizards are most easily observed on rock fences along roads.  Near Apatzingan innumerable individuals can be seen in mid-morning.  Later in the day, as the sun rises higher in the sky, the lizards  retreat to the shade of the crevices in the fences. The abundance of  these lizards in the Tepalcatepec Valley, together with evidence  gathered from the natives of the valley, indicates that these lizards  are seldom used for human consumption there. On the other hand, several  people in Coalcoman consider the \"iguana negra\" (local name for  _Ctenosaura_) to be a delicacy and serve it at every opportunity. In  early July, 1951, brilliant green young of the year were collected at La  Playa and at Coalcoman.      ~Enyaliosaurus clarki~ (Bailey)         _Ctenosaura clarki_ Bailey, Proc. U. S. Natl.

This species is known only from the low areas of the Balsas-Tepalcatepec  Basin between elevations of 200 and 510 meters. It is commonly found in  the open arid tropical scrub forest dominated by _Prosopsis_ sp.,  _Apoplanesia paniculata_, and _Cercidium plurifoliolatum_. Continued  collecting in the Tepalcatepec Valley has borne out the suggestions of  Duellman and Duellman (1959) concerning the distribution and abundance  of this lizard. Also, continued collecting in Colima and on the Pacific  coast has failed to reveal the presence of _Enyaliosaurus_ there.      ~Phrynosoma asio~ Cope         _Phrynosoma asio_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       16:178, September 30, 1864.--Colima, Colima, Mexico.         Apatzingan (4); San Salvador.    In Michoacan this species has been obtained only in the Tepalcatepec  Valley and on the northern slopes of the Sierra de Coalcoman between 300  and 700 meters. Apparently the lizard is absent from the coastal  lowlands of Michoacan and Guerrero. The distribution of this species,  therefore, is discontinuous. One population inhabits the lowlands of  Colima and the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin inland to northern Guerrero and  Morelos; a southern population inhabits the Plains of Tehuantepec in  Oaxaca.    A juvenile from Apatzingan (USNM 47739) has a snout-vent length of 40.0  mm. and a tail length of 19.5 mm.      ~Sceloporus aeneus aeneus~ Wiegmann         _Sceloporus aeneus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 21:370,       1828.--Mexico.
