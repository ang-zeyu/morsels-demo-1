Season sparingly; it is  easier to put salt in than to get it out. Cayenne pepper adds zest to a  soup or stew, but, as some dislike it, let each man season his plate to  his own cheek.    Fried squirrels are excellent for a change, but are mostly spoiled by  poor cooks, who put tough old he's and tender young squirrels together,  treating all alike. To dress and cook them properly, chop off heads,  tails and feet with the hatchet; cut the skin on the back crosswise,  and, inserting the two middle fingers, pull the skin off in two parts,  (head and tail). Clean and cut them in halves, leaving two ribs on the  hindquarters. Put hind and fore quarters into the kettle, and parboil  until tender. This will take about twenty minutes for young ones, and  twice as long for the old.    When a sharpened sliver will pass easily through the flesh, take the  hindquarters from the kettle, drain, and place them in the frying-pan  with pork fat hissing hot. Fry to a light, rich brown. It is the only  proper way to cook squirrels. The forequarters are to be left in the  kettle for a stew.    It sometimes happens that pigeons are very plentiful, and the camp is  tempted into over-shooting and over-cooking, until every one is  thoroughly sick of pigeons. This is all wrong. No party is, or can be,  justified in wanton slaughter, just because birds happen to be  plentiful; they will soon be scarce enough. Pigeons are hardly game, and  they are not a first-class bird; but a good deal may be got out of them  by the following method: Dress them, at the rate of two birds to one  man; save the giblets; place in the kettle, and boil until the sliver  will easily pierce the breast; fork them out, cut the thick meat from  each side of the breast bone, roll slightly in flour, and put the pieces  in the pan, frying them in the same way as directed for squirrels. Put  the remainder of the birds in the kettle for a stew.    Quail are good cooked in the same manner, but are better roasted or  broiled. To roast them, parboil for fifteen minutes, and in the meantime  cut a thin hard-wood stick, eighteen inches long for each bird. Sharpen  the sticks neatly at both ends; impale the birds on one end and thrust  the sticks into the ground near the fire, leaning them so that the heat  will strike strongly and evenly. Hang a strip of pork between the legs  of each bird, and turn frequently until they are a rich brown. When the  sharpened sliver will pass easily through the breast they are done.    Woodcock are to be plucked, but not drawn. Suspend the bird in a bright,  clear heat, hang a ribbon of fat pork between the legs, and roast until  well done; do not parboil him.    Ruffed grouse are excellent roasted in the same manner, but should first  be parboiled. Mallards, teal, butterballs, all edible ducks, are to be  treated the same as grouse. If you are ever lucky enough to feast on a  canvas-back roasted as above, you will be apt to borrow a leaf from  Oliver Twist.    Venison steak should be pounded to tenderness, pressed and worked into  shape with the hunting-knife, and broiled over a bed of clean hard-wood  coals. A three-pronged birch fork makes the best broiler. For roast  venison, the best portion is the forward part of the saddle. Trim off  the flanky parts and ends of the ribs; split the backbone lengthwise,  that the inner surface may be well exposed; hang it by a strong cord or  bark string in a powerful, even heat; lay thin strips of pork along the  upper edge, and turn from time to time until done. It had better be left  a little rare than overdone. Next to the saddle for roasting, comes the  shoulder. Peel this smoothly from the side, using the hunting knife;  trim neatly, and cut off the leg at the knee; gash the thickest part of  the flesh, and press shreds of pork into the gashes, with two or three  thin slices skewered to the upper part. Treat it in the roasting as  described above. It is not equal to the saddle when warm, but sliced and  eaten cold, is quite as good.    And do not despise the fretful porcupine; he is better than he looks. If  you happen on a healthy young specimen when you are needing meat, give  him a show before condemning him. Shoot him humanely in the head, and  dress him. It is easily done; there are no quills on the belly, and the  skin peels as freely as a rabbit's. Take him to camp, parboil him for  thirty minutes, and roast or broil him to a rich brown over a bed of  glowing coals. He will need no pork to make him juicy, and you will find  him very like spring lamb, only better.    I do not accept the decision that ranks the little gray rabbit as a  hare, simply because he has a slit in his lip; at all events I shall  call him a rabbit for convenience, to distinguish him from his  long-legged cousin, who turns white in winter, never takes to a hole,  and can keep ahead of hounds nearly all day, affording a game, musical  chase that is seldom out of hearing. He never by any chance has an ounce  of fat on him, and is not very good eating. He can, however, be worked  into a good stew or a passable soup--provided he has not been feeding on  laurel. The rabbit is an animal of different habits, and different  attributes. When jumped from his form, he is apt to \"dig out\" for a hole  or the nearest stone heap. Sometimes an old one will potter around a  thicket, ahead of a slow dog, but his tendency is always to hole. But he  affords some sport, and as an article of food, beats the long-legged  hare out of sight. He is excellent in stews or soups, while the after  half of him, flattened down with the hatchet, parboiled and fried brown  in butter or pork fat, is equal to spring chicken.    [Sidenote: _Fish_]    In the cooking of fish, as of flesh and fowl, the plainest and simplest  methods are best; and for anything under two pounds, it is not necessary  to go beyond the frying-pan. Trout of over a pound should be split down  the back, that they may lie well in the pan, and cook evenly. Roll well  in meal, or a mixture of meal and flour, and fry to a rich brown in pork  fat, piping hot. Larger fish may just as well be fried, but are also  adapted to other methods, and there are people who like fish broiled and  buttered, or boiled. To broil a fish, split him on the back and broil  him four minutes, flesh side down, turn and broil the other side an  equal time. Butter and season to taste. To boil, the fish should weigh  three pounds or more. Clean, and crimp him by gashing the sides deeply  with a sharp knife. Put him in a kettle of boiling water strongly  salted, and boil twenty-five minutes. For each additional pound above  three, add five minutes. For gravy, rub together two tablespoonfuls of  flour and one of melted butter, add one heaping teaspoonful of  evaporated milk, and thin with liquor from the kettle. When done, it  should have the consistency of cream. Take the fish from the kettle,  drain, pour the gravy over it, and eat only with wheat bread or  hard-tack, with butter. The simplest is best, healthiest, and most  appetizing.    As a rule, on a mountain tramp or a canoe cruise, I do not tote canned  goods. I carry my duffle in a light, pliable knapsack, and there is an  aggravating antagonism between the uncompromising rims of a fruit-can,  and the knobs of my vertebrae, that twenty years of practice have  utterly failed to reconcile. And yet, I have found my account in a can  of condensed milk, not for tea or coffee, but on bread as a substitute  for butter. And I have found a small can of Boston baked beans a most  helpful lunch, with a nine-mile carry ahead. It was not epicurean, but  had staying qualities.    I often have a call to pilot some muscular young friend into the deep  forest, and he usually carries a large pack-basket, with a full supply  of quart cans of salmon, tomatoes, peaches, etc. As in duty bound, I  admonish him kindly, but firmly, on the folly of loading his young  shoulders with such effeminate luxuries; often, I fear, hurting his  young feelings by brusque advice. But at night, when the camp-fire burns  brightly, and he begins to fish out his tins, the heart of the Old  Woodsman relents, and I make amends by allowing him to divide the  groceries.    There is a method of cooking usually called \"mudding up,\" which I have  found to preserve the flavor and juiciness of ducks, grouse, etc.,  better than any other method. I described the method in _Forest and  Stream_ more than a year ago, but a brief repetition may not be out of  place here. Suppose the bird to be cooked is a mallard, or better still,  a canvas-back. Cut off the head and most part of the neck; cut off the  pinions and pull out the tail feathers, make a plastic cake of clay or  tenacious earth an inch thick, and large enough to envelop the bird, and  cover him with it snugly. Dig an oval pit under the fore-stick, large  enough to hold him, and fill it with hot coals, keeping up a strong  heat. Just before turning in for the night, clean out the pit, put in  the bird, cover with hot embers and coals, keeping up a brisk fire over  it all night. When taken out in the morning you will have an oval,  oblong mass of baked clay, with a well roasted bird inside. Let the mass  cool until it can be handled, break off the clay, and feathers and skin  will come with it, leaving the bird clean and skinless. Season it as you  eat, with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon if you like, nothing  else.    [Sidenote: _Condiments_]    In selecting salt, choose that which has a gritty feel when rubbed  between the thumb and finger, and use white pepper rather than black,  grinding the berry yourself. Procure a common tin pepper-box, and fill  it with a mixture of fine salt and Cayenne pepper--ten spoonsfuls of the  former and one of the latter.

She blushed deeply, but did not speak. A moment later she hurried from  the room, and after a long absence, returned with his breakfast.    That done, they went to the synagogue together as usual; and no one  seeing them had the least idea of the agony of heart they were both  enduring.    \"Thank God! there is nothing wrong,\" said old Jutta to the other  maid-servant when she saw them come home together, and sit down to their  dinner as usual.    Nathan soon rose, saying, \"Be not afraid. I am going to speak to him  now. You shall know our decision in half an hour.\"    He went up-stairs to the rooms occupied by Herr von Negrusz. The  district judge was seated at his writing-table. He seemed confused when  he saw the husband of the woman he loved. He expected a painful scene.    Nathan's manner was very quiet, and after a courteous greeting, he said:  \"Herr von Negrusz, your confusion shows that you know the reason of my  visit. You wrote this letter to my wife, but before I give you the  answer, tell me--why did you do it? Is not the commandment, 'Thou shalt  not covet thy neighbor's wife,' as binding upon you as upon me?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Herr von Negrusz, \"I know that I am guilty of a great  sin--I love your wife. I make no excuse for myself.\"    \"I am glad you have answered so candidly,\" said Nathan. \"I have nothing  further to say, except to give you the answer to your letter. My wife  returns your love, therefore she can not be my wife any longer; and I  shall take the proper steps to obtain a divorce. What shall you do then,  Herr von Negrusz?\"    \"So help me God, I will marry her!\" he replied, earnestly.    Nathan looked at him keenly. \"Good,\" he said. \"I have no doubt that you  intend to do so, for you are an honorable man; but you are a Government  official, a Christian, and of noble birth. She is only a Jewess. You are  educated; Chane is not. You may afterward be influenced by these  considerations, and repudiate your present plan of action. I must guard  against your doing so; for Chane was my wife, and the moment she leaves  me for your sake, her father and the whole Jewish community will cast  her off. Should you break your promise, I shall take her back, for  I--but enough of that. I tell you plainly, if you do not marry her, _I  will kill you, so help me God_! You are the district judge, and I am  nothing but a Jew. You have a hundred means at your disposal of getting  rid of me, but I will keep my word.\"    Herr von Negrusz raised his hand, and was about to protest, but Nathan  interrupted him hastily: \"Do not swear,\" he said, \"but keep your word,  so that I may not have to keep mine. Chane and I will be divorced in a  few days, and if she is not your wife before the end of two months, you  are a dead man. Farewell.\"    He went home and said to his wife: \"We will go to the Rabbi to-morrow,  and tell him that we have an insurmountable dislike to each other, and  he will at once give us a divorce on that account. The Christian has  promised to marry you. Had that not been his intention before, it is  now....\"    \"Nathan!\" she cried, throwing herself at his feet, and covering his hand  with tears and kisses--\"Nathan, how good you are!\"    \"No,\" he answered, \"I am not good. I am only doing what I consider to be  my duty. I am atoning for a sin that was committed through no fault of  mine. We were married without our feelings being consulted. That was a  sin, and it is expiated now; for I love you, although perhaps I did not  know it until yesterday, and you do not love me--but another. I can not  doom you to misery; rather than do that, I suffer myself. This is the  plain state of the case, and I claim no merit for what I am doing. What  distresses me most is that you will leave our faith, and that I enable  you to do so. I have prayed so earnestly to God for pardon, that I hope  He will forgive me. He sees my heart, and He knows that I have no  choice.\"           *       *       *       *       *    There is little more to tell.    Nathan obtained a divorce in the course of a few days, and a few weeks  after, Chane--now Christine--married Herr von Negrusz.    There had not been such a scandal in the neighborhood for years. Curses  and malevolence followed Chane to her new home; and even those who  wished her well, shook their heads over the marriage.    The reader already knows that the curses were fruitless, and the fears  of the benevolent unfounded. That Chane lived, a happy wife and mother,  in the same house, on the threshold of which Esther Freudenthal had died  because she had loved a Christian. This time love had triumphed over  creed. It seemed to work miracles: for not only did it overlap barriers,  but in spite of the objectionable features of the case, and the  dissimilarity of the husband and wife, theirs was a happy marriage. For  theirs was true love, and true love is a mighty power, a divine gift,  without which it is a sin against God and man to enter into any  marriage.    Christine von Negrusz has only one sorrow. It is not that Frau Emilie  will hardly speak to her, or that the three elderly \"Graces\" look the  other way when they chance to meet; nor is it the sardonic smile with  which Herr von Bolwinski accompanies the words--\"I was the first to  notice it, ho, ho!\" whenever he has the opportunity. None of these  things distress her; but a real shadow lies upon her otherwise happy  life.    This is the wrath of her father, which will probably never cease until  the lonely, disappointed old man finds peace in the grave.    Nathan took great pains to save her this one sorrow, but he was not  successful. He does not yet give up hope of a reconciliation, and every  time he revisits Barnow, he tries to soften the old man's heart.    But Nathan is seldom at Barnow, and when he returns there two or three  times in the year, his visits are short. His business in the little town  is managed for him by a cousin, and he travels to distant countries. He  is no longer a small shop-keeper, but one of the richest wine-merchants  in the country.    He has never married again. Once it was supposed that he was engaged to  a girl in Czernowitz, but it was not the case. Only one person knew the  reason of his solitude, and this was Frau Christine.    This she learned the only time she ever saw him to speak to after their  separation. Nathan and Herr von Negrusz always met with friendly  feelings, and when the former was at home, the two boys were continually  with him; but he had avoided any meeting with Christine until now. It  was at the time that people said that he was going to be married again.  The boys were sitting with Nathan on the bench at the house-door, and as  it was late, their mother came to fetch them. They ran to meet her,  showed her the presents Nathan had brought for them, and dragged her up  to the bench.    \"I must thank you, Herr Silberstein,\" she said, in a trembling voice;  but she corrected herself quickly, and went on--\"I must thank you,  Nathan, for being so kind to the children.\"    \"They are such dear little boys,\" he said, hastily. \"I am very glad,  Chane, to see you so happy.\"    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"I am very happy--and you?\"    \"Thank you,\" he said, quietly; \"the business is prospering.\"    \"The other day I heard some good news about you--from Czernowitz.\"    \"There is nothing in it,\" he answered.    \"Oh, why? She is said to be a good and pretty girl.\"    He looked at her, and then on the ground. \"I found that I could not love  her,\" he said.    Many years have passed since then, and Nathan is one of the richest men  in the country. People wonder why he works so hard when he has no one to  leave his riches to. But Nathan smiles at such questions--he knows that  he is working for some one.          TWO SAVIOURS OF THE PEOPLE.    (1870.)      Any one who was ever in Barnow was sure to make the acquaintance of Frau  Hanna, mother of the chief of the Jewish session; and no one could know  her without honestly liking and admiring her, she was so good and kind,  and so very quick in understanding and entering into the thoughts and  feelings of others. But it would be difficult to convey an adequate idea  of her loving-kindness and wisdom to those who never knew her. She was  called _Babele_ (grannie) by everybody who lived in the little town, and  not merely by her own grandchildren; and no wonder. She was never too  busy or too tired to help those who needed her assistance either in word  or deed; and even those who did not require money or advice used to  delight in going to see her, and in hearing her stories of old times;  for her renown as a story-teller was as great as her reputation for  benevolence. Any one passing the old synagogue or _judenburg_ about the  third hour on a Sabbath afternoon in summer, might see with his own eyes  what a crowd of attentive listeners she had, and might hear with his own  ears how well worth listening to her stories always were. She used to  sit on a rug spread out in the shade with her silent eager auditors, who  sometimes numbered fifty men and women, grouped closely around her for  fear of losing a single word that fell from her lips. Her stories were  all about old days in Barnow--about things that had happened within her  own memory, or that she had heard from others. Any attempt to reproduce  her stories as she used to relate them would be very difficult, and if I  try to do so, it is only because the tale I have chosen is the one she  related far oftener than any other. I have heard her tell it scores of  times, and will now endeavor to translate it from the Jewish-German in  which she used to speak as faithfully as I can:    \"Who is great,\" began Frau Hanna, \"and who is small? Who is mighty, and  who is weak? We poor short-sighted mortals are seldom capable of  deciding this question rightly. The rich and strong are mighty and great  in our eyes, while the poor and feeble are "]]]
