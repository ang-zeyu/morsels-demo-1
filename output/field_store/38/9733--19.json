Soul is synonymous with Spirit, God, the          creative, governing, infinite Principle outside of finite form,  71:9    which forms only reflect.                                  Dream-lessons            Close your eyes, and you may dream that you see a          flower, - that you touch and smell it. Thus you learn  71:12   that the flower is a product of the so-called          mind, a formation of thought rather than of          matter. Close your eyes again, and you may see land-  71:15   scapes, men, and women. Thus you learn that these          also are images, which mortal mind holds and evolves          and which simulate mind, life, and intelligence. From  71:18   dreams also you learn that neither mortal mind nor          matter is the image or likeness of God, and that im-          mortal Mind is not in matter.                                  Found wanting    71:21   When the Science of Mind is understood, spiritualism          will be found mainly erroneous, having no scientific basis          nor origin, no proof nor power outside of  71:24   human testimony. It is the offspring of the          physical senses. There is no sensuality in Spirit. I never          could believe in spiritualism.    71:27   The basis and structure of spiritualism are alike ma-          terial and physical. Its spirits are so many corporealities,          limited and finite in character and quality. Spiritualism  71:30   therefore presupposes Spirit, which is ever infinite, to be          a corporeal being, a finite form, - a theory contrary to          Christian Science.    72:1    There is but one spiritual existence, - the Life of          which corporeal sense can take no cognizance. The  72:3    divine Principle of man speaks through immortal sense.          If a material body - in other words, mortal, material          sense - were permeated by Spirit, that body would  72:6    disappear to mortal sense, would be deathless. A con-          dition precedent to communion with Spirit is the gain of          spiritual life.                              Spirits obsolete    72:9    So-called /spirits/ are but corporeal communicators. As          light destroys darkness and in the place of darkness all          is light, so (in absolute Science) Soul, or God,  72:12   is the only truth-giver to man. Truth de-          stroys mortality, and brings to light immortality. Mortal          belief (the material sense of life) and immortal Truth  72:15   (the spiritual sense) are the tares and the wheat, which          are not united by progress, but separated.            Perfection is not expressed through imperfection.  72:18   Spirit is not made manifest through matter, the anti-          pode of Spirit. Error is not a convenient sieve through          which truth can be strained.                              Scientific phenomena    72:21   God, good, being ever present, it follows in divine          logic that evil, the suppositional opposite of good, is never          present. In Science, individual good derived  72:24   from God, the infinite All-in-all, may flow          from the departed to mortals; but evil is neither com-          municable nor scientific. A sinning, earthly mortal is  72:27   not the reality of Life nor the medium through which          truth passes to earth. The joy of intercourse becomes          the jest of sin, when evil and suffering are communicable.  72:30   Not personal intercommunion but divine law is the com-          municator of truth, health, and harmony to earth and          humanity. As readily can you mingle fire and frost as  73:1    Spirit and matter. In either case, one does not support          the other.    73:3    Spiritualism calls one person, living in this world, /ma-          terial/, but another, who has died to-day a sinner and sup-          posedly will return to earth to-morrow, it terms a /spirit/.  73:6    The fact is that neither the one nor the other is infinite          Spirit, for Spirit is God, and man is His likeness.                                 One government            The belief that one man, as spirit, can control an-  73:9    other man, as matter, upsets both the individuality and          the Science of man, for man is image. God          controls man, and God is the only Spirit. Any  73:12   other control or attraction of so-called spirit is a mortal          belief, which ought to be known by its fruit, - the repe-          tition of evil.    73:15   If Spirit, or God, communed with mortals or controlled          them through electricity or any other form of matter, the          divine order and the Science of omnipotent, omnipresent  73:18   Spirit would be destroyed.                               Incorrect theories            The belief that material bodies return to dust, hereafter          to rise up as spiritual bodies with material sensations and  73:21   desires, is incorrect. Equally incorrect is the          belief that spirit is confined in a finite, ma-          terial body, from which it is freed by death, and that, when  73:24   it is freed from the material body, spirit retains the sensa-          tions belonging to that body.                                 No me-diumship            It is a grave mistake to suppose that matter is any part  73:27   of the reality of intelligent existence, or that Spirit and          matter, intelligence and non-intelligence, can          commune together. This error Science will  73:30   destroy. The sensual cannot be made the mouthpiece of          the spiritual, nor can the finite become the channel of          the infinite. There is no communication between so-  74:1    called material existence and spiritual life which is not          subject to death.                               Opposing conditions    74:3    To be on communicable terms with Spirit, persons must          be free from organic bodies; and their return to a mate-          rial condition, after having once left it, would  74:6    be as impossible as would be the restoration          to its original condition of the acorn, already absorbed          into a sprout which has risen above the soil. The seed  74:9    which has germinated has a new form and state of exist-          ence. When here or hereafter the belief of life in matter          is extinct, the error which has held the belief dissolves  74:12   with the belief, and never returns to the old condition.          No correspondence nor communion can exist between          persons in such opposite dreams as the belief of having  74:15   died and left a material body and the belief of still living          in an organic, material body.                               Bridgeless division            The caterpillar, transformed into a beautiful insect,  74:18   is no longer a worm, nor does the insect return to          fraternize with or control the worm. Such          a backward transformation is impossible in  74:21   Science. Darkness and light, infancy and manhood,          sickness and health, are opposites, - different beliefs,          which never blend. Who will say that infancy can utter  74:24   the ideas of manhood, that darkness can represent light,          that we are in Europe when we are in the opposite hemi-          sphere? There is no bridge across the gulf which divides  74:27   two such opposite conditions as the spiritual, or incor-          poreal, and the physical, or corporeal.            In Christian Science there is never a retrograde step,  74:30   never a return to positions outgrown. The so-called dead          and living cannot commune together, for they are in          separate states of existence, or consciousness.                            Unscientific investiture    75:1    This simple truth lays bare the mistaken assumption          that man dies as matter but comes to life as spirit. The  75:3    so-called dead, in order to reappear to those          still in the existence cognized by the physical          senses, would need to be tangible and material, - to have  75:6    a material investiture, - or the material senses could take          no cognizance of the so-called dead.            Spiritualism would transfer men from the spiritual sense  75:9    of existence back into its material sense. This gross mate-          rialism is scientifically impossible, since to infinite Spirit          there can be no matter.                                Raising the dead    75:12   Jesus said of Lazarus: \"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;          but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.\" Jesus          restored Lazarus by the understanding that  75:15   Lazarus had never died, not by an admis-          sion that his body had died and then lived again. Had          Jesus believed that Lazarus had lived or died in his  75:18   body, the Master would have stood on the same plane of          belief as those who buried the body, and he could not have          resuscitated it.    75:21   When you can waken yourself or others out of the belief          that all must die, you can then exercise Jesus' spiritual          power to reproduce the presence of those who have thought  75:24   they died, - but not otherwise.                               Vision of the dying            There is one possible moment, when those living on the          earth and those called dead, can commune together, and  75:27   that is the moment previous to the transition,          - the moment when the link between their op-          posite beliefs is being sundered. In the vestibule through  75:30   which we pass from one dream to another dream, or          when we awake from earth's sleep to the grand verities          of Life, the departing may hear the glad welcome of those  76:1    who have gone before. The ones departing may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#16)"],[1,"by situation, are united in the  principal action; the contrast is not dictated by affectation, but by  truth and propriety; a figure absorbed in thought, often serves as a  relief to another that acts and speaks; the masses of light and shade  are not arbitrarily poised, but are in the most select imitation of  nature; all is art, but all is consummate skill and concealment of art.  The School of Athens, as it is called, in the Vatican, is in this  respect amongst the most wonderful compositions in the world. They who  succeeded Raffaello, and followed other principles, have afforded more  pleasure to the eye, but have not given such satisfaction to the mind.  The compositions of Paul Veronese contain a greater number of figures,  and more decoration; Lanfranco and the machinists introduced a powerful  effect, and a vigorous contrast of light and shade: but who would  exchange for such a manner the chaste and dignified style of Raffaello?  Poussin alone, in the opinion of Mengs, obtained a superior mode of  composition in the groundwork, or economy of his subject; that is to  say, in the judicious selection of the scene of the event.    We have thus concisely stated the perfection to which Raffaello carried  his art, in the short space allotted him. There is not a work in nature  or art where he has not practically illustrated his own axiom, as handed  down to us by Federigo Zuccaro, that things must be represented, not as  they are, but as they ought to be; the country, the elements, animals,  buildings, every age of man, every condition of life, every affection,  all was embraced and rendered more beautiful by the divine genius of  Raffaello. And if his life had been prolonged to a more advanced period,  without even approaching the term allowed to Titian or Michelangiolo,  who shall say to what height of perfection he might not have carried his  favourite art? Who can divine his success in architecture and sculpture,  if he had applied himself to the study of them; having so wonderfully  succeeded in his few attempts in those branches of art?    Of his pictures a considerable number are to be found in private  collections, particularly on sacred subjects, such as the Madonna and  Child, and other compositions of the Holy Family. They are in the three  styles which we have before described: the Grand Duke has some specimens  of each. The most admired is that which is named the Madonna della  Seggiola.[52] Of this class of pictures it is often doubted whether they  ought to be considered as originals, or copies, as some of them have  been three, five, or ten times repeated. The same may be said of other  cabinet pictures by him, particularly the S. John in the desart, which  is in the Grand Ducal gallery at Florence, and is found repeated in many  collections both in Italy and in other countries. This was likely to  happen in a school where the most common mode was the following:--The  subject was designed by Raffaello, the picture prepared by Giulio, and  finished by the master so exquisitely, that one might almost count the  hairs of the head. When the pictures were thus finished, they were  copied by the scholars of Raffaello, who were very numerous, and of the  second and third order; and these were also sometimes retouched by  Giulio and by Raffaello himself. But whoever is experienced in the  freedom and delicacy of the chief of this school, need not fear  confounding his productions with those of the scholars, or of Giulio  himself; who, besides having a more timid pencil, made use of a darker  tint than his master was accustomed to do. I have met with an  experienced person, who declared that he could recognize the character  of Giulio in the dark parts of the flesh tints, and in the middle dark  tints, not of a leaden colour as Raffaello used, nor so well harmonized;  in the greater quantity of light, and in the eyes designed more roundly,  which Raffaello painted somewhat long, after the manner of Pietro.    On this propitious commencement was founded the school which we call  Roman, rather from the city of Rome itself, than from the people, as I  have before observed. For as the inhabitants of Rome are a mixture of  many tongues, and many different nations, of whom the descendants of  Romulus form the least proportion; so the school of painting has been  increased in its numbers by foreigners whom she has received and united  to her own, and who are considered in her academy of S. Luke, as if they  had been born in Rome, and enjoyed the ancient rights of Romans. Hence  is derived the great variety of names that we find in the course of it.  Some, as Caravaggio, derived no assistance from the study of the ancient  marbles, and other aids peculiar to the capital; and these may be said  to have been in the Roman School, but not to have formed a part of it.  Others adopted the principles of the disciples of Raffaello, and their  usual method was to study diligently both Raffaello and the ancient  marbles; and from the imitation of him, and more particularly of the  antique, resulted, if I err not, the general character, if I may so  express it, of the Roman School: the young artists who were expert in  copying statues and bassirelievi, and who had those objects always  before their eyes, could easily transfer their forms to the panel or the  canvas. Hence their style is formed on the antique, and their beauty is  more ideal than that of other schools. This circumstance, which was an  advantage to those who knew how to use it, became a disadvantage to  others, leading them to give their figures the air of statues,  beautiful, but isolated, and not sufficiently animated. Others have done  themselves greater injury from copying the modern statues of saints; a  practice which facilitated the representation of devout attitudes, the  disposition of the folds in the garments of the monks and priests, and  other peculiarities which are not found in ancient sculpture. But as  sculpture has gradually deteriorated, it could not have any beneficial  influence on the sister art; and it has hence led many into mannerism in  the folds of their drapery, after Bernino and Algardi; excellent  artists, but who ought not to have influenced the art of painting, as  they did, in a city like Rome. The style of invention in this school is,  in general, judicious, the composition chaste, the costume carefully  observed, with a moderate study of ornament. I speak of pictures in oil,  for the frescos of this later period ought to be separately considered.  The colouring, on the whole, is not the most brilliant, nor is it yet  the most feeble; there being always a supply of artists from the  Lombards, or Flemings, who prevented it being entirely neglected.    We may now return to the original subject of our inquiry, examine the  principles of the Roman School, and attend it to its latest epoch.  Raffaello at all times employed a number of scholars, constantly  instructing and teaching them; whence he never went to court, as we are  assured by Vasari, without being accompanied by probably fifty of the  first artists, who attended him out of respect. He employed every one in  the way most agreeable to his talent. Some having received sufficient  instruction, returned to their native country, others remained with him  as long as he lived, and after his death established themselves in Rome,  where they became the germs of this new school. At the head of all was  Giulio Romano, whom, with Gio. Francesco Penni, Raffaello appointed his  heir, whence they both united in finishing the works on which their  master was employed at his death. They associated to themselves as an  assistant Perino del Vaga, and to render the connexion permanent, they  gave him a sister of Penni to his wife. To these three were also joined  some others who had worked under Raffaello. On their first establishment  they did not meet with any great success, for, as Vasari informs us, the  chief place in art being by universal consent assigned to Fra  Sebastiano, through the partiality of Michelangiolo, the followers of  Raffaello were kept in the back ground. We may also add, as another  cause, the death of Leo X., in 1521, and the election of his successor,  Adrian VI., a decided enemy to the fine arts, by whom the public works  contemplated, and already commenced by his predecessor, remained  neglected; and many artists, in consequence of the want of employment,  occasioned by this event, and by the plague, in 1523, were reduced to  the greatest distress. But Adrian dying after a reign of twenty-three  months, and Giulio de' Medici being elected in his place under the name  of Clement VII., the arts again revived. Raffaello, before his death,  had begun to paint the great saloon, and had designed some figures, and  left many sketches for the completion of it. It was intended to  represent four historical events, although the subjects of some of them  are disputed. These were the Apparition of the Cross, or the harangue of  Constantine; the battle wherein Maxentius is drowned, and Constantine  remains victor; the Baptism of Constantine, received from the hands of  S. Silvester; and the Donative of the city of Rome, made to the same  pontiff. Giulio finished the two first subjects, and Giovanni Francesco  the other two, and they added to them bassirelievi, painted in imitation  of bronze under each of the same subjects, with some additional figures.  They afterwards painted, or rather finished the pictures of the villa at  Monte Mario, a work ordered by the Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and  suspended until the second or third year of his papal reign. This villa  was afterwards called di Madama, and there still remain many traces,  although suffering from time, of the munificence of that prince, and the  taste of the school of Raffaello. Giulio meanwhile, with the permission  of the pope, established himself in Mantua, Il Fattore went to Naples;  and some"]]]
