The chief took  some and held them out to Thorfinn and hugged the cloak to him.    [Illustration: \"_The chief held them out to Thorfinn and hugged the  cloak to him_\"]    \"He wants to trade,\" Thorfinn said. \"Will you do it, Biarni?\"    \"Yes,\" Biarni answered, and took the furs.    \"If they want red stuff, I have a whole roll of red cloth that I will  trade,\" one of the other men said.    He went and got it. When the strangers saw it they quickly held out more  furs and seemed eager to trade. So Thorfinn cut the cloth into pieces  and sold every scrap. When the strangers got it they tied it about their  heads and seemed much pleased.    While this trading was going on and everybody was good-natured, a bull  of Thorfinn's ran out of the woods bellowing and came towards the crowd.  When the strangers heard it and saw it they threw down whatever was in  their hands and ran to their canoes and paddled off as fast as they  could.    The Norsemen laughed.    \"We have lost our customers,\" Biarni said.    \"Did they never see a bull before?\" laughed one of the men.    Now after three weeks the Norsemen saw canoes in the bay again. This  time it was black with them, there were so many. The people in them were  all making a horrible shout.    \"It is a war-cry,\" Thorfinn said, and he raised a red shield. \"They are  surely twenty to our one, but we must fight. Stand in close line and  give them a taste of your swords.\"    Even as he spoke a great shower of stones fell upon them. Some of the  Norsemen were hit on the head and knocked down. Biarni got a broken arm.  Still the storm came fast. The strangers had landed and were running  toward the Norsemen. They threw their stones with sling-shots, and they  yelled all the time.    \"Oh, this is no kind of fighting for brave men!\" Thorfinn cried angrily.    The Norsemen's swords swung fast, and many of the strangers died under  them, but still others came on, throwing stones and swinging stone axes.  The horrible yelling and the strange things that the savages did  frightened the Norsemen.    \"These are not men,\" some one cried.    Then those Norsemen who had never been afraid of anything turned and  ran. But when they came to the top of a rough hill Thorfinn cried:    \"What are we doing? Shall we die here in this empty land with no one to  bury us? We are leaving our women.\"    Then one of the women ran out of the hut where they were hiding.    \"Give me a sword!\" she cried. \"I can drive them back. Are Norsemen not  better than these savages?\"    Then those warriors stopped, ashamed, and stood up before the wild men  and fought so fiercely that the strangers turned and fled down to their  canoes and paddled away.    \"Oh, I am glad they are gone!\" Thorfinn said. \"It was an ugly fight.\"    \"Thor would not have loved that battle,\" one said.    \"It was no battle,\" another replied. \"It was like fighting against an  army of poisonous flies.\"    The Norsemen were all worn and bleeding and sore. They went to their  huts and dressed their wounds, and the women helped them. At supper that  night they talked about the fight for a long time.    \"I will not stay here,\" Gudrid said. \"Perhaps these wild men have gone  away to get more people and will come back and kill us. Oh! they are  ugly.\"    \"Perhaps brown faces are looking at us now from behind the trees in the  woods back there,\" said Biarni.    It was the wish of all to go home. So after a few days they sailed back  to Greenland with good weather all the way. The people at Eric's house  were very glad to see them.    \"We were afraid you had died,\" they said.    \"And I thought once that we should never leave Wineland alive,\" Thorfinn  answered.    Then they told all the story.    \"I wonder why I had no such bad luck,\" Leif said. \"But you have a better  shipload than I got.\"    He was looking at the bundles of furs and the kegs of wine.    \"Yes,\" said Thorfinn, \"we have come back richer than when we left. But I  will never go again for all the skins in the woods.\"    The next summer Thorfinn took Gudrid and Snorri and all his people and  sailed back to Iceland, his home. There he lived until he died. People  looked at him in wonder.    \"That is the man who went to Wineland and fought with wild men,\" they  said. \"Snorri is his son. He is the first and last Winelander, for no  one will ever go there again. It will be an empty and forgotten land.\"    And so it was for a long time. Some wise men wrote down the story of  those voyages and of that land, and people read the tale and liked it,  but no one remembered where the place was. It all seemed like a fairy  tale. Long afterwards, however, men began to read those stories with  wide-open eyes and to wonder. They guessed and talked together, and  studied this and that land, and read the story over and over. At last  they have learned that Wineland was in America, on the eastern shore of  the United States, and they have called Snorri the first American, and  have put up statues of Leif Ericsson, the first comer to America.[15]    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [15] See note about Eskimos on page 199.          Descriptive Notes      _House._ In a rich Norseman's home were many buildings. The finest and  largest was the great feast hall. Next were the bower, where the women  worked, and the guest house, where visitors slept. Besides these were  storehouses, stables, work-shops, a kitchen, a sleeping-house for  thralls. All these buildings were made of heavy, hewn logs, covered with  tar to fill the cracks and to keep the wood from rotting. The ends of  the logs, the door-posts, the peaks of gables, were carved into shapes  of men and animals and were painted with bright colors. These gay  buildings were close together, often set around the four sides of a  square yard. That yard was a busy and pleasant place, with men and women  running across from one bright building to another. Sometimes a high  fence with one gate went around all this, and only the tall, carved  peaks of roofs showed from the outside.    _Names._ An old Norse story says: \"Most men had two names in one, and  thought it likeliest to lead to long life and good luck to have double  names.\" To be called after a god was very lucky. Here are some of those  double names with their meanings: \"Thorstein\" means Thor's stone;  \"Thorkel\" means Thor's fire; \"Thorbiorn\" means Thor's bear; \"Gudbrand\"  means Gunnr's sword (Gunnr was one of the Valkyrias[16]); \"Gunnbiorn\"  means Gunnr's bear; \"Gudrid\" means Gunnr's rider; \"Gudrod\" means  Gunnr's land-clearer. (Most of the land in old Norway was covered with  forests. When a man got new land he had to clear off the trees.) In  those olden days a man did not have a surname that belonged to everyone  in his family. Sometimes there were two or three men of the same name in  a neighborhood. That caused trouble. People thought of two ways of  making it easy to tell which man was being spoken of. Each was given a  nickname. Suppose the name of each was Haki. One would be called Haki  the Black because he had black hair. The other would be called Haki the  Ship-chested because his chest was broad and strong. These nicknames  were often given only for the fun of it. Most men had them,--Eric the  Red, Leif the Lucky, Harald Hairfair, Rolf Go-afoot. The other way of  knowing one Haki from the other was to tell his father's name. One was  Haki, Eric's son. The other was Haki, Halfdan's son. If you speak these  names quickly, they sound like Haki Ericsson and Haki Halfdansson. After  a while they were written like that, and men handed them on to their  sons and daughters. Some names that we have nowadays have come down to  us in just that way--Swanson, Anderson, Peterson, Jansen. There was  another reason for these last names: a man was proud to have people know  who his father was.    _Drinking-horns._ The Norsemen had few cups or goblets. They used  instead the horns of cattle, polished and trimmed with gold or silver or  bronze. They were often very beautiful, and a man was almost as proud  of his drinking-horn as of his sword.    _Tables._ Before a meal thralls brought trestles into the feast hall and  set them before the benches. Then they laid long boards across from  trestle to trestle. These narrow tables stretched all along both sides  of the hall. People sat at the outside edge only. So the thralls served  from the middle of the room. They put baskets of bread and wooden  platters of meat upon these bare boards. At the end of the meal they  carried out tables and all, and the drinking-horns went round in a clean  room.    _Beds._ Around the sides of the feast hall were shut-beds. They were  like big boxes with doors opening into the hall. On the floor of this  box was straw with blankets thrown over it. The people got into these  beds and closed the doors and so shut themselves in. Olaf's men could  have set heavy things against these doors or have put props against  them. Then the people could not have got out; for on the other side of  the bed was the thick outside wall of the feast hall, and there were no  windows in it.    _Feast Hall._ The feast hall was long and narrow, with a door at each  end. Down the middle of the room were flat stones in the dirt floor.  Here the fires burned. In the roof above these fires were holes for the  smoke to go out, but some of it blew about the hall, and the walls and  rafters were stained with it. But it was pleasant wood smoke, and the  Norsemen did not dislike it. There were no large windows in a feast hall  or in any other Norse building. High up under the eaves or in the roof  itself were narrow slits that were called wind's-eyes. There was no  glass in them, for the Norsemen did not know how to make it; but there  were, instead, covers made of thin, oiled skin. These were put into the  wind's-eyes in stormy weather. There were covers, too, for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#16)"],[1," excitement; but spurred again by despair, he made a couple  of bold cuts, severed the leather thongs, and sprang to his feet.    But there was much yet to do: the bit to fasten, and how could he get it  into the mouth of the horrified beast?--the girths to tighten, while the  cob backed away.    Neither was possible, and glancing once over his shoulder, Dyke snatched  at the mane, but missed it, for the cob started violently, but stopped a  couple of yards away, paralysed with horror at the approach of the  great, stealthy beast.    Another clutch at the mane, and the cob started again; but Dyke had  seized it fast, and was dragged a few yards before Breezy stopped,  trembling in terror; as making one last effort, the boy made a leap and  scramble to mount, dragging the saddle half round, but getting his leg  over, clinging now with both hands to the mane.    Nothing could have been narrower.    The lion had given up its stealthy, creeping approach, and risen at last  to commence a series of bounds, ending with one tremendous leap, which  launched it through the air, and would have landed it next upon Dyke and  his brave little steed; but horror drove off the trembling, paralytic  seizure, and Breezy made also his frantic bound forward, with the result  that the lion almost grazed the horse's haunches as it passed, and  alighted upon the sand.  The beast turned with a savage roar; but, urged  by fear, and spurred by its master's hoarse cries, the cob was  galloping, with its eyes turned wildly back, and every breath coming  with a snort of dread.    Certainly nothing could have been narrower, for, enraged by its failure,  the lion was in full pursuit, keeping up bound after bound; but swiftly  as it launched itself forward, its speed fell short of the pace at which  the brave little cob swept over the sand, spurning it at every effort in  a blinding shower right in the lion's face, while Dyke, lying prostrate,  clinging with hand and knee, was in momentary expectation of being  thrown off.    The pursuit was not kept up for more than three hundred yards.  Then the  lion stopped short, and sent forth a series of its thunderous,  full-throated roars, every one making Breezy start and plunge  frantically forward, with the sweat darkening its satin coat.    But the danger was past, and for the next ten minutes Dyke strove hard  to master a hysterical sensation of a desire to sob; and then gaining  strength, and beginning to breathe with less effort, he drew himself up  erect, and tried by voice and caress to slacken the frightened animal's  headlong speed.    \"Wo-ho, lad! wo-ho, lad!\" he cried, and the speed slackened into a  canter.    \"My word!\" muttered the boy to himself, \"I don't know how I managed to  stick on!\"    Ten minutes later he managed to stop the cob, and sliding off wearily,  he stroked and patted its reeking neck, unbuckled and slipped in the  bit, attached the reins to the loose side, and arranged them ready for  mounting.  Then dragging the saddle back into its place, he properly  tightened the girths, and gave two or three searching glances backward  the while.    But the lion, far or near, was well hidden, and they were well out in  one of the barest parts of the plain, which now spread tenantless as far  as eye could reach, while the eland was quite out of sight.    And now, as he proceeded to mount, Dyke awoke to the fact that his back  was bruised sore by the gun, which had beaten him heavily; he was  drenched with perspiration; and it was an effort to lift his foot to the  stirrup, his knees being terribly stiff.  He was conscious, too, of a  strange feeling of weariness of both mind and body, and as he sank into  the saddle he uttered a low sigh.    But he recovered a bit directly, and turning the cob's head, began to  ride slowly in the direction of Kopfontein, whose granite pile lay like  an ant-hill far away, low down on the eastern horizon.    He was too tired to think; but he noted in a dull, half-stunned way that  the sun was getting very low, and it struck him that unless he hurried  on, darkness would overtake him long before he could get home.    But it did not seem to matter; and though it hurt him a little, there  was something very pleasant in the easy, rocking motion of Breezy's  cantering stride, while the wind swept, cool and soft, against his  cheeks.    Then he began to think about the events of the day--his narrow escape,  which seemed to be dreamlike now, and to belong to the past; next he  found himself wondering where the dog was, and whether it had found his  cartridge pouch.  Lastly, he thought of Emson, and his ride back to  fetch Jack and the oxen--a long task, for the bullocks were so slow and  deliberate at every pace.    But it did not seem to matter, for everything was very restful and  pleasant, as the golden sun sent the shadow of himself and horse far  away along the plain.  He was safe, for the lion could be laughed at by  any one well mounted as he was then.  At last the pleasant sensation of  safety was combined with a dull restfulness that grew and grew, till,  moving gently in that canter over the soft sand, which hushed the cob's  paces to a dull throb, the glow in the west became paler and paler, and  then dark.    Then bright again, for Dyke recovered himself with a jerk, and sat  upright, staring.    \"I do believe I was dropping off to sleep,\" he muttered.  \"That won't  do.  I shall be off.--Go on, Breezy, old boy.  You had a good long rest,  and didn't have to crawl on your knees.  How far is it now?\"    Far enough, for the kopje was only just visible against the sky.    But again it did not seem to matter, for all grew dull again.  Dyke had  kept on nodding forward, and was jerked up again, but only for him to  begin nodding again.  Soon after he made a lurch to the left, and Breezy  ceased cantering, and gave himself a hitch.  Then followed a lurch to  the right, and the cob gave himself another hitch to keep his master  upon his back, progressing afterwards at a steady walk, balancing his  load: for Dyke was fast asleep, with the reins slack and his chin down  upon his chest, and kept in his place by the natural clinging of his  knees, and the easy movement of the sagacious beast he rode.  But all at  once he lurched forward, and instinctively clung to the horse's neck,  with the result that Breezy stopped short, and began to crop the shoots  of the bushes, only moving a step or two from time to time.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    DYKE IS AGGRIEVED.    \"Fine chance for a lion,\" said Emson, as at dusk he left the oxen, being  slowly driven by Kaffir Jack, and cantered off to his left to draw rein  in front of Dyke, the boy sitting upright with a start.    \"Eh?\"    \"I say a fine chance for a lion,\" cried Emson again.    \"No: couldn't catch,\"--_snore_.    \"Here!  Hi!  Little one.  Wake up!\" cried Emson.    \"Yes; all right!--What's the matter?\"    \"Matter? why, you're asleep, you stupid fellow: a lion might have come  upon you in that state.\"    \"Lion?  Come upon?  Did--did you speak to me?\" said Dyke thickly.    \"Speak to you? of course.  Why, you foolish, careless fellow, what was  the matter?  Afraid to stay by the game?\"    Dyke looked at him drowsily, striving to catch all that had been said,  but only partially grasping the meaning.    \"Don't know--what you mean,\" he said thickly.    \"I mean it was very cowardly of you to forsake your charge, boy,\" said  Emson sternly.  \"It's vital for us to save that meat, and I trusted you  to watch it.  Now you've come away, and it will be horribly mauled by  the jackals; perhaps we shall find half a hundred vultures feeding upon  it when we get there.  Hang it, Dyke! you might have stayed till I came  back.\"    Dyke was too much confused to make any reply.  Utterly exhausted as he  had been, his deep sleep seemed to still hold him, and he sat gazing  vacantly at his brother, who added in a tone full of contempt:    \"There, don't stare at me in that idiotic way.  Come along; let's try  and save something.  Look sharp!  One of us must ride on, or we shall  not find it before it's dark.\"    Dyke rode beside him in silence, for Breezy eagerly joined his stable  companion, and in a short time they were up to, and then passed Jack  with his plodding oxen, which were drawing a rough sledge, something  similar to that which a farmer at home uses for the conveyance of a  plough from field to field.    The angry look soon passed away from Emson's face, and he turned to  Dyke.    \"There, look up, old chap,\" he said; \"don't pull a phiz like that.\"    Dyke was still half stupefied by sleep, but he had grasped his brother's  former words, and these were uppermost, rankling still in his mind as he  said heavily:    \"You talked about the jackals and vultures, Joe.\"    \"Yes, yes; but I was in a pet, little un--vexed at the idea of losing  our stock of good fresh meat.  That's all over now, so say no more about  it.  Began to think I was never coming, didn't you?  Well, I was long.\"  Emson might just as well have held his tongue, for nothing he now said  was grasped by Dyke, who could think of nothing else but the former  words, and he repeated himself:    \"You talked about the jackals and vultures, Joe.\"    \"Yes, yes, I did; but never mind now, old chap.\"    \"But you didn't say a word about the lions.\"    \"What?\" cried Emson excitedly.  \"You have had no lions there, surely?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dyke, bitterly now, for he was waking up, and felt deeply  aggrieved.  \"Two great beasts.\"    \"But in open day?\"    Dyke nodded.    \"Then why didn't you fire?  A shot or two would have scared them away.\"    \"Yes,\" continued the boy in the same bitter tone; \"but you can't fire  when your gun's empty, and you have no cartridges.\"    \"But you had plenty when we started.  I filled your pouch.\"    \"Yes, but it came undone in the ride after the eland.  It's lost.  I  sent Duke to try and find it, and he didn't come back.\"    \"My poor old chap!\""]]]
