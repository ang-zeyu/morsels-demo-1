Conservative in character, thrifty in habits, they were not of a class  who would venture from any slight motive to excite the hatred of a  world which they knew would deem itself outraged by their avowal. Each  one of them knew enough of the early experiences of Joseph to feel  certain that he, too, would become the object of clerical ridicule and  the vindictive persecution of the masses, incited by jealous religious  leaders. At every step since Joseph's encounter with the intolerant  spirit of the community in which he lived, he had been obliged to  call upon the Lord to aid him with more than mortal courage, to meet  and withstand the cruel assaults of his enemies. In thus joining him,  the witnesses and early members of the Church provoked the hostility  already raging against him, and they were obliged to seek the same  source for the same reinforcement of their natural strength, moral and  physical.    In this inception of the work its character was defined to a marvelous  degree. Joseph himself, and much less his companions, may not have  fully understood the divine simplicity and sublime comprehensiveness  of the organization of the Church of the Lamb of God which he was  commanded to effect upon that memorable day; but their minds were  enlightened by the Spirit of God, and by the gift of prophecy they  were inspired to foretell the grandeur of the results that would be  accomplished through this organization. Standing at this distance  of time from that day, the observer can clearly see how beautifully  adapted it is for the purposes for which it is designed. Suitable in  the beginning for the government of a Church of six members, and for  branches of the Church composed of any number of members, experience  has demonstrated that it is capable of furnishing heavenly government  for the entire race of man. Coming from Deity, it possesses divine  perfection and admits of magnificent and infinite expansion. No  officers necessary for the correct government of the Church and for  the growth and full development of its members were omitted, and  their spheres of operation and labor were so well defined that, while  they retain the Spirit of the Lord, there can be no conflict or even  friction between them. Fully recognizing the free agency of man, the  Lord designed that the officers should derive their power to control,  and the system its wonderful elasticity and strength, from the  cheerfully-yielded obedience of its members. In this way the requisite  authority to govern, the power to enforce and maintain order, and  complete personal freedom are harmoniously blended in the organization  of the Church as revealed to the Prophet Joseph.    The gospel, as revealed in part and promised in full to him at that  early day, was a pure and simple gift to all men upon the face of  the earth who would make themselves worthy. It neither contemplated  unrighteous espionage of thought and personal action, nor unholy  servitude or worship of man by man. The barbarity of power, which  characterized the apostate churches which swayed the world of  Christendom for so many long centuries, did not exist in this divine  plan for the salvation of the human race. Such gloomy tenets as  infantile damnation or accountability, and the consigning of the soul  to a place of eternal misery and torment from which there could be no  deliverance and to which there could be no alleviation, embodied in  the systems of religion which were taught and vouched for by their  teachers as divine, were absent from this simple gospel. At the time  of the organization of His Church, God made known His gospel in all  the simplicity and fullness of truth, sublime and symmetrical as  taught by the Redeemer, not as it had been perverted for ages. All  the dark and cruel mysteries which had enshrouded so-called religion  were swept away. Joseph had learned by most glorious and satisfactory  experience that it was possible for man to approach and know God for  himself. He taught his fellows that this is the true foundation of the  gospel of salvation; that it is every human being's privilege to lift  his eyes to God, to obtain revelation and every good gift from Him  through obedience to His laws. Who can measure the great blossoming  of human character which has already appeared, and the rich fruitage  which the coming generations will yet yield through the enforcement of  this grand truth? One of the accusations brought against the Savior,  and for which His enemies sought to stone Him, was that He, being a  man, made Himself equal with God. To a generation such as they, from  whom God was so far removed that all communication between them had  ceased, such a relationship between man and the great Creator, as the  Lord Jesus taught as existing, was offensive and blasphemous. It was  this elevating and ennobling truth that the Prophet Joseph taught to  the world. He taught a gospel of man's worship to God, and not man's  servitude to his fellow. One of its grand principles is that each soul  must be accountable to its Creator for its deeds; and no person who has  not reached the years of individual accountability is condemned for  the non-performance of ceremonies or ordinances which he can neither  understand nor attend to. Infants are all saved in Christ; and need no  penance, no baptism, no church membership. But a man who has heard the  word of God is personally responsible for his own life and must bear  the consequences of its rejection in his own person.    The full recognition of God's authority as bestowed by Him and man's  equality with his fellow-man constitute the vitality of the Kingdom  of God. But Satan prompts man to establish creeds of man-worship, in  which priestcraft, as opposed to priesthood, prevails. He appeals to  the avarice and ambition of men and divides society into classes,  making worldly learning, the possession of wealth, and the \"accident of  birth,\" the distinctions which command respect and honor. The theology  of the churches, which flourished in the region where Joseph dwelt  from boyhood to maturity, flowed from the muddy stream. But he was not  influenced by it. Through the revelations of Jesus, the theology which  he was inspired to teach was utterly unlike any system taught by man.    Instead of being lifted up by the favor which had been shown to him,  Joseph was made to feel his own weaknesses. Chosen to be a prophet  and the leader of God's people, he was conscious that he was only  human, subject to human temptations and human frailties. Having the  honesty and courage inspired by the Spirit of the Lord, he dared to  confess this openly; and, under the same inspiration, acknowledge his  transgression and make his contrition known. He was not above any law  which applied to his fellow-man. Of his responsibility to God and his  brethren of the Church, he was required by the law revealed through  himself to the Church, to give as strict an account as any other  member. They who participated with him in authority owed it not to him  as an individual, but to the eternal power to which they were alike  responsible.    The grandeur of Joseph's character is most shown in his lack of  pretension. Christ declared Himself the head of the Church; and though  Joseph was to be our Savior's representative here on earth, he exacted  no homage from his fellow-believers, but only such respect as the  gospel required them to pay. The thought of gaining glory for himself  appears never to have entered his mind. His conduct in the beginning,  in execution of the requirements of the Lord, was but a type of his  whole life. The commands of God came through him to earth, and he gave  them voice firmly and fearlessly. Speaking as a prophet of God under  the influence of the Spirit, he brooked no opposition; but in his  personal relations with his fellow-Apostles and Elders he gave them,  according to their station and their deserts, as much deference as he  asked, or was willing to receive for himself. This characteristic gave  him power in the beginning. Only he who knows how to obey is worthy to  command; only he who yields to others their due can expect compliance  with his own order, however lawful it may be.    From this time of the organization of the Church, the revelations of  God have come constantly, through Christ's chosen representative, to  guide, to instruct, to admonish and to warn the people; and from this  source the body of the Saints has received its daily life.        CHAPTER XIII.    THE ALL-COMPREHENDING CHARACTER OF JOSEPH'S INSPIRATION--FIRST  PUBLIC MEETING OF THE CHURCH AFTER ORGANIZATION--BELIEVERS ASKING  BAPTISM--MOBS SEEKING THE LIFE OR THE LIBERTY OF THE PROPHET--TWICE  ARRESTED AND ACQUITTED--JOSEPH'S LAWYER HEARS A MYSTERIOUS  VOICE--COPYING THE REVELATIONS.    Joseph saw his mission now in its full significance. The instruction  which came to him when he first prayed in the woods at Manchester did  not mean that he alone should find salvation outside of the creeds of  man; but that the error of the ages was to be overthrown by the hand of  God, and the way opened for the redemption of a race.    The organization of the Church, therefore, meant that the chief Apostle  of Christ in this last dispensation should take upon himself the cross  and bear it through life. The people must be edified and perfected, and  the Gospel must be extended freely to the acceptance or rejection of  all nations, kindreds, tongues and people.    Joseph knew now that through prayer to Heaven he must seek stores of  wisdom for his own guidance and for the secure establishment and the  perfect government of the Church of our Lord and Savior. He was not  obliged to search the worldly records of the past for knowledge and  inspiration. If at this hour, all the histories of earthly governments  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#14)"],[1,"to have  possessed among the chiefs and nobles of the district. In other places  the shore was of a more gentle description, indented with small bays,  where the land sloped smoothly down, or sent into the sea promontories  covered with wood.                A scene so different from what last night's journey had presaged produced  a proportional effect upon Mannering. Beneath his eye lay the modern  house--an awkward mansion, indeed, in point of architecture, but well  situated, and with a warm, pleasant exposure. 'How happily,' thought our  hero, 'would life glide on in such a retirement! On the one hand, the  striking remnants of ancient grandeur, with the secret consciousness of  family pride which they inspire; on the other, enough of modern elegance  and comfort to satisfy every moderate wish. Here then, and with thee,  Sophia!'    We shall not pursue a lover's day-dream any farther. Mannering stood a  minute with his arms folded, and then turned to the ruined castle.    On entering the gateway, he found that the rude magnificence of the inner  court amply corresponded with the grandeur of the exterior. On the one  side ran a range of windows lofty and large, divided by carved mullions  of stone, which had once lighted the great hall of the castle; on the  other were various buildings of different heights and dates, yet so  united as to present to the eye a certain general effect of uniformity of  front. The doors and windows were ornamented with projections exhibiting  rude specimens of sculpture and tracery, partly entire and partly broken  down, partly covered by ivy and trailing plants, which grew luxuriantly  among the ruins. That end of the court which faced the entrance had also  been formerly closed by a range of buildings; but owing, it was said, to  its having been battered by the ships of the Parliament under Deane,  during the long civil war, this part of the castle was much more ruinous  than the rest, and exhibited a great chasm, through which Mannering could  observe the sea, and the little vessel (an armed lugger), which retained  her station in the centre of the bay. [Footnote: The outline of the above  description, as far as the supposed ruins are concerned, will be found  somewhat to resemble the noble remains of Carlaverock Castle, six or  seven miles from Dumfries, and near to Lochar Moss.] While Mannering was  gazing round the ruins, he heard from the interior of an apartment on the  left hand the voice of the gipsy he had seen on the preceding evening. He  soon found an aperture through which he could observe her without being  himself visible; and could not help feeling that her figure, her  employment, and her situation conveyed the exact impression of an ancient  sibyl.    She sate upon a broken corner-stone in the angle of a paved apartment,  part of which she had swept clean to afford a smooth space for the  evolutions of her spindle. A strong sunbeam through a lofty and narrow  window fell upon her wild dress and features, and afforded her light for  her occupation; the rest of the apartment was very gloomy. Equipt in a  habit which mingled the national dress of the Scottish common people with  something of an Eastern costume, she spun a thread drawn from wool of  three different colours, black, white, and grey, by assistance of those  ancient implements of housewifery now almost banished from the land, the  distaff and spindle. As she spun, she sung what seemed to be a charm.  Mannering, after in vain attempting to make himself master of the exact  words of her song, afterwards attempted the following paraphrase of what,  from a few intelligible phrases, he concluded to be its purport:--         Twist ye, twine ye! even so       Mingle shades of joy and woe,       Hope, and fear, and peace, and strife,       In the thread of human life.         While the mystic twist is spinning,       And the infant's life beginning,       Dimly seen through twilight bending,       Lo, what varied shapes attending!         Passions wild, and Follies vain,       Pleasures soon exchanged for pain,       Doubt, and Jealousy, and Fear       In the magic dance appear.         Now they wax, and now they dwindle,       Whirling with the whirling spindle.       Twist ye, twine ye! even so       Mingle human bliss and woe.    Ere our translator, or rather our free imitator, had arranged these  stanzas in his head, and while he was yet hammering out a rhyme for  DWINDLE, the task of the sibyl was accomplished, or her wool was  expended. She took the spindle, now charged with her labours, and,  undoing the thread gradually, measured it by casting it over her elbow  and bringing each loop round between her forefinger and thumb. When she  had measured it out, she muttered to herself--'A hank, but not a haill  ane--the full years o' three score and ten, but thrice broken, and thrice  to OOP (i.e. to unite); he'll be a lucky lad an he win through wi't.'    Our hero was about to speak to the prophetess, when a voice, hoarse as  the waves with which it mingled, hallooed twice, and with increasing  impatience--'Meg, Meg Merrilies! Gipsy--hag--tausend deyvils!'    'I am coming, I am coming, Captain,' answered Meg; and in a moment or two  the impatient commander whom she addressed made his appearance from the  broken part of the ruins.    He was apparently a seafaring man, rather under the middle size, and with  a countenance bronzed by a thousand conflicts with the north-east wind.  His frame was prodigiously muscular, strong, and thick-set; so that it  seemed as if a man of much greater height would have been an inadequate  match in any close personal conflict. He was hard-favoured, and, which  was worse, his face bore nothing of the insouciance, the careless,  frolicsome jollity and vacant curiosity, of a sailor on shore. These  qualities, perhaps, as much as any others, contribute to the high  popularity of our seamen, and the general good inclination which our  society expresses towards them. Their gallantry, courage, and hardihood  are qualities which excite reverence, and perhaps rather humble pacific  landsmen in their presence; and neither respect nor a sense of  humiliation are feelings easily combined with a familiar fondness towards  those who inspire them. But the boyish frolics, the exulting high  spirits, the unreflecting mirth of a sailor when enjoying himself on  shore, temper the more formidable points of his character. There was  nothing like these in this man's face; on the contrary, a surly and even  savage scowl appeared to darken features which would have been harsh and  unpleasant under any expression or modification. 'Where are you, Mother  Deyvilson?' he said, with somewhat of a foreign accent, though speaking  perfectly good English. 'Donner and blitzen! we have been staying this  half-hour. Come, bless the good ship and the voyage, and be cursed to ye  for a hag of Satan!'    At this moment he noticed Mannering, who, from the position which he had  taken to watch Meg Merrilies's incantations, had the appearance of some  one who was concealing himself, being half hidden by the buttress behind  which he stood. The Captain, for such he styled himself, made a sudden  and startled pause, and thrust his right hand into his bosom between his  jacket and waistcoat as if to draw some weapon. 'What cheer, brother? you  seem on the outlook, eh?' Ere Mannering, somewhat struck by the man's  gesture and insolent tone of voice, had made any answer, the gipsy  emerged from her vault and joined the stranger. He questioned her in an  undertone, looking at Mannering--'A shark alongside, eh?'    She answered in the same tone of under-dialogue, using the cant language  of her tribe--'Cut ben whids, and stow them; a gentry cove of the ken.'  [Footnote: Meaning--Stop your uncivil language; that is a gentleman from  the house below.]    The fellow's cloudy visage cleared up. 'The top of the morning to you,  sir; I find you are a visitor of my friend Mr. Bertram. I beg pardon, but  I took you for another sort of a person.'    Mannering replied, 'And you, sir, I presume, are the master of that  vessel in the bay?'    'Ay, ay, sir; I am Captain Dirk Hatteraick, of the Yungfrauw  Hagenslaapen, well known on this coast; I am not ashamed of my name, nor  of my vessel--no, nor of my cargo neither for that matter.'    'I daresay you have no reason, sir.'    'Tausend donner, no; I'm all in the way of fair trade. Just loaded yonder  at Douglas, in the Isle of Man--neat cogniac--real hyson and  souchong--Mechlin lace, if you want any--right cogniac--we bumped ashore  a hundred kegs last night.'    'Really, sir, I am only a traveller, and have no sort of occasion for  anything of the kind at present.'    'Why, then, good-morning to you, for business must be minded--unless  ye'll go aboard and take schnaps; you shall have a pouch-full of tea  ashore. Dirk Hatteraick knows how to be civil.'    There was a mixture of impudence, hardihood, and suspicious fear about  this man which was inexpressibly disgusting. His manners were those of a  ruffian, conscious of the suspicion attending his character, yet aiming  to bear it down by the affectation of a careless and hardy familiarity.  Mannering briefly rejected his proffered civilities; and, after a surly  good-morning, Hatteraick retired with the gipsy to that part of the ruins  from which he had first made his appearance. A very narrow staircase here  went down to the beach, intended probably for the convenience of the  garrison during a siege. By this stair the couple, equally amiable in  appearance and respectable by profession, descended to the sea-side. The  soi-disant captain embarked in a small boat with two men, who appeared to  wait for him, and the gipsy remained on the shore, reciting or singing,  and gesticulating with great vehemence.
