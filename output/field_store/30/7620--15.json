As the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security  of the before-mentioned kind, and as her behaviour had been always  extremely modest, which is the certain consequence of understanding in  women; she had passed above four years at Mr Partridge's (for that was  the schoolmaster's name) without creating the least suspicion in her  mistress. Nay, she had been treated with uncommon kindness, and her  mistress had permitted Mr Partridge to give her those instructions  which have been before commemorated.    But it is with jealousy as with the gout: when such distempers are in  the blood, there is never any security against their breaking out; and  that often on the slightest occasions, and when least suspected.    Thus it happened to Mrs Partridge, who had submitted four years to her  husband's teaching this young woman, and had suffered her often to  neglect her work, in order to pursue her learning. For, passing by one  day, as the girl was reading, and her master leaning over her, the  girl, I know not for what reason, suddenly started up from her chair:  and this was the first time that suspicion ever entered into the head  of her mistress. This did not, however, at that time discover itself,  but lay lurking in her mind, like a concealed enemy, who waits for a  reinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself  and proceeds upon hostile operations: and such additional strength  soon arrived to corroborate her suspicion; for not long after, the  husband and wife being at dinner, the master said to his maid, _Da  mihi aliquid potum:_ upon which the poor girl smiled, perhaps at the  badness of the Latin, and, when her mistress cast her eyes on her,  blushed, possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her  master. Mrs Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a fury, and  discharged the trencher on which she was eating, at the head of poor  Jenny, crying out, \"You impudent whore, do you play tricks with my  husband before my face?\" and at the same instant rose from her chair  with a knife in her hand, with which, most probably, she would have  executed very tragical vengeance, had not the girl taken the advantage  of being nearer the door than her mistress, and avoided her fury by  running away: for, as to the poor husband, whether surprize had  rendered him motionless, or fear (which is full as probable) had  restrained him from venturing at any opposition, he sat staring and  trembling in his chair; nor did he once offer to move or speak, till  his wife, returning from the pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive  measures necessary for his own preservation; and he likewise was  obliged to retreat, after the example of the maid.    This good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition                To make a life of jealousy       And follow still the changes of the moon       With fresh suspicions--    With her, as well as him,              --To be once in doubt,       Was once to be resolvd--    she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and  begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night  within her walls.    Mr Partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a  matter of this nature. He therefore had recourse to his usual receipt  of patience, for, though he was not a great adept in Latin, he  remembered, and well understood, the advice contained in these words         --_Leve fit quod bene fertur onus_    in English:         A burden becomes lightest when it is well borne--    which he had always in his mouth; and of which, to say the truth, he  had often occasion to experience the truth.    Jenny offered to make protestations of her innocence; but the tempest  was too strong for her to be heard. She then betook herself to the  business of packing, for which a small quantity of brown paper  sufficed, and, having received her small pittance of wages, she  returned home.    The schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough  that evening, but something or other happened before the next morning,  which a little abated the fury of Mrs Partridge; and she at length  admitted her husband to make his excuses: to which she gave the  readier belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall Jenny,  professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, she was grown  of little use as a servant, spending all her time in reading, and was  become, moreover, very pert and obstinate; for, indeed, she and her  master had lately had frequent disputes in literature; in which, as  hath been said, she was become greatly his superior. This, however, he  would by no means allow; and as he called her persisting in the right,  obstinacy, he began to hate her with no small inveteracy.        Chapter iv.    Containing one of the most bloody battles, or rather duels, that were  ever recorded in domestic history.      For the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter, and from some  other matrimonial concessions, well known to most husbands, and which,  like the secrets of freemasonry, should be divulged to none who are  not members of that honourable fraternity, Mrs Partridge was pretty  well satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause, and  endeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false  suspicion. Her passions were indeed equally violent, whichever way  they inclined; for as she could be extremely angry, so could she be  altogether as fond.    But though these passions ordinarily succeed each other, and scarce  twenty-four hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not, in some  degree, the object of both; yet, on extraordinary occasions, when the  passion of anger had raged very high, the remission was usually  longer: and so was the case at present; for she continued longer in a  state of affability, after this fit of jealousy was ended, than her  husband had ever known before: and, had it not been for some little  exercises, which all the followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform  daily, Mr Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several  months.    Perfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner  to be the forerunners of a storm, and I know some persons, who,  without being generally the devotees of superstition, are apt to  apprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be  attended with its opposite. For which reason the antients used, on  such occasions, to sacrifice to the goddess Nemesis, a deity who was  thought by them to look with an invidious eye on human felicity, and  to have a peculiar delight in overturning it.    As we are very far from believing in any such heathen goddess, or from  encouraging any superstition, so we wish Mr John Fr----, or some other  such philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out  the real cause of this sudden transition from good to bad fortune,  which hath been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to  give an instance; for it is our province to relate facts, and we shall  leave causes to persons of much higher genius.    Mankind have always taken great delight in knowing and descanting on  the actions of others. Hence there have been, in all ages and nations,  certain places set apart for public rendezvous, where the curious  might meet and satisfy their mutual curiosity. Among these, the  barbers' shops have justly borne the pre-eminence. Among the Greeks,  barbers' news was a proverbial expression; and Horace, in one of his  epistles, makes honourable mention of the Roman barbers in the same  light.    Those of England are known to be no wise inferior to their Greek or  Roman predecessors. You there see foreign affairs discussed in a  manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the  coffee-houses; and domestic occurrences are much more largely and  freely treated in the former than in the latter. But this serves only  for the men. Now, whereas the females of this country, especially  those of the lower order, do associate themselves much more than those  of other nations, our polity would be highly deficient, if they had  not some place set apart likewise for the indulgence of their  curiosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half  of the species.    In enjoying, therefore, such place of rendezvous, the British fair  ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign  sisters; as I do not remember either to have read in history, or to  have seen in my travels, anything of the like kind.    This place then is no other than the chandler's shop, the known seat  of all the news; or, as it is vulgarly called, gossiping, in every  parish in England.    Mrs Partridge being one day at this assembly of females, was asked by  one of her neighbours, if she had heard no news lately of Jenny Jones?  To which she answered in the negative. Upon this the other replied,  with a smile, That the parish was very much obliged to her for having  turned Jenny away as she did.    Mrs Partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long  since cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered  boldly, She did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that  account; for she believed Jenny had scarce left her equal behind her.    \"No, truly,\" said the gossip, \"I hope not, though I fancy we have  sluts enow too. Then you have not heard, it seems, that she hath been  brought to bed of two bastards? but as they are not born here, my  husband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep  them.\"    \"Two bastards!\" answered Mrs Partridge hastily: \"you surprize me! I  don't know whether we must keep them; but I am sure they must have  been begotten here, for the wench hath not been nine months gone  away.\"    Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind,  especially when hope, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#14)"],[1,"took an equal portion by  partition, but the eldest son had the right to buy out the others  as to the chief messuage [manor; dwelling and supporting land and  buildings] as long as he compensated them with property of equal  value. If there were no legitimate sons, then each daughter took  an equal share when she married.    In London, one-third of the personal property of a decedent went  to his wife, one-third went to his children in equal shares, and  one-third he could bequeath as he wished.    \"If a man dies intestate [without a will], his lord shall have  heriot [horses, weapons, shields, and helmets] of his property  according to the deceased's rank and [the rest of] the property  shall be divided among his wife, children, and near kinsmen.\"    A man could justifiably kill an adulterer in the act with the  man's wife, daughter, sister, or mother. In Kent, a lord could  fine any bondswoman of his who had become pregnant without his  permission [childwyte].    A man could kill in defense of his own life, the life of his  kinsmen, his lord, or a man whose lord he was. The offender was  \"caught red-handed\" if the blood of his victim was still on him.  Self-help was available for hamsocne [breaking into a man's house  to assault him].    Murder is punished by death as follows: \"If any man break the  King's peace given by hand or seal, so that he slay the man to  whom the peace was given, both his life and lands shall be in the  King's power if he be taken, and if he cannot be taken he shall be  held an outlaw by all, and if anyone shall be able to slay him he  shall have his spoils by law.\" The king's peace usually extended  to important designated individuals, churches, assemblies, those  traveling to courts or assemblies, and particular times and  places. Often a king would extend his peace to fugitives from  violent feuds if they asked the king, earls, and bishops for time  to pay compensation for their misdeeds. From this came the  practice of giving a portion of the \"profits of justice\" to such  men who tried the fugitive. The king's peace came to be extended  to those most vulnerable to violence: foreigners, strangers, and  kinless persons.    \"If anyone by force break or enter any man's court or house to  slay or wound or assault a man, he shall pay 100s. to the King as  fine.\"    \"If anyone slay a man within his court or his house, himself and  all his substance are at the King's will, save the dower of his  wife if he have endowed her.\"    If a person fights and wounds anyone, he is liable for his wer. If  he fells a man to death,  he is then an outlaw and is to be seized  by raising the hue and cry. And if anyone kills him for resisting  God's law or the king's, there will be no compensation for his  death.    A man could  kill a thief over twelve years in the act of carrying  off his property over 8d., e.g. the thief hand-habbende [a thief  found with the stolen goods in his hand] or the thief back-berend  [a thief found carrying stolen goods on his back].    Cattle theft could be dealt with only by speedy pursuit. A person  who had involuntarily lost possession of cattle is to at once  raise the hue and cry. He was to inform the hundred-man, who then  called the tithing-men. All these neighbors had to then follow the  trail of the cow to its taker, or pay 30d. to the hundred for the  first offense, and 60d. for the second offense, half to the  hundred and half to the lord, and half a pound [10s.] for the  third offense, and forfeiture of all his property and declared  outlaw for the fourth offense. If the hundred pursued a track into  another hundred, notice was to be given to that hundred-man. If he  did not go with them, he had to pay 30s. to the king.    If a thief was brought into prison, he was to be released after 40  days if he paid his fine of 120s. His kindred could become his  sureties, to pay according to his wer if he stole again. If a  thief forfeited his freedom and gave himself up, but his kindred  forsook him, and he does not know of anyone who will make bot for  him; let him then do theow-work, and let the wer abate for the  kindred.    Measures and weights of goods for sale shall be correct.    Every man shall have a warrantor to his market transactions and no  one shall buy and sell except in a market town; but he shall have  the witness of the portreeve or of other men of credit, who can be  trusted.    Moneyers accused of  minting money outside a designated market  were to go to the ordeal of the hot iron with the hand that was  accused of doing the fraud. If he was found guilty, his hand that  did the offense was to be struck off and be set up on the money-  smithy.    No marketing, business, or hunting may be done on Sundays.    No one may bind a freeman, shave his head in derision, or shave  off his beard. Shaving was a sign of enslavement, which could be  incurred by not paying one's fines for offenses committed.    No clergy may gamble or participate in games of chance.    The Laws for London were:    \"1. The gates called Aldersgate and Cripplegate were in charge of      guards.    2.  If a small ship came to Billingsgate, one half-penny was paid      as toll; if a larger ship with sails, one penny was paid.        1) If a hulk or merchantman arrives and lies there, four pence         is paid as toll.        2) From a ship with a cargo of planks, one plank is given as         toll.        3) On three days of the week toll for cloth [is paid] on Sunday         and Tuesday and Thursday.        4) A merchant who came to the bridge with a boat containing fish         paid one half-penny as toll, and for a larger ship one penny.\"        5 - 8) Foreigners with wine or blubber fish or other goods and         their tolls.    Foreigners were allowed to buy wool, melted sheep fat [tallow],  and three live pigs for their ships.    \"3. If the town-reeve or the village reeve or any other official      accuses anyone of having withheld toll, and the man replies that      he has kept back no toll which it was his legal duty to pay, he      shall swear to this with six others and shall be quit of the      charge.        1) If he declares that he has paid toll, he shall produce the         man to whom he paid it, and shall be quit of the charge.        2) If, however, he cannot produce the man to whom he paid it, he         shall pay the actual toll and as much again and five pounds to         the King.        3) If he vouches the tax-gatherer to warranty [asserting] that         he paid toll to him, and the latter denies it, he shall clear         himself by the ordeal and by no other means of proof.    4.  And we [the king and his counselors] have decreed that a man      who, within the town, makes forcible entry into another man's      house without permission and commits a breach of the peace of the      worst kind ... and he who assaults an innocent person on the      King's highway, if he is slain, shall lie in an unhonored grave.        1) If, before demanding justice, he has recourse to violence,         but does not lose his life thereby, he shall pay five pounds         for breach of the King's peace.        2) If he values the good-will of the town itself, he shall pay         us thirty shillings as compensation, if the King will grant us         this concession.\"    5. No base coin or coin defective in quality or weight, foreign or  English, may be used by a foreigner or an Englishman. (In 956, a  person found guilty of illicit coining was punished by loss of a  hand.)                                 - Judicial Procedure -    There were courts for different geographical communities. The  arrangement of the whole kingdom into shires was completed by 975  after being united under King Edgar.    A shire was a larger area of land, headed by an earl. A shire  reeve or \"sheriff\" represented the royal interests in the shires  and in the shire courts. This officer came to be selected by the  king and earl of the shire to be a judicial and financial deputy  of the earl and to execute the law. The office of sheriff, which  was not hereditary, was also responsible for the administration of  royal lands and royal accounts. The sheriff summoned the freemen  holding land in the shire, four men selected by each community or  township, and all public officers to meet twice a year at their  \"shire-mote\". Actually only the great lords - the bishops, earls,  and thegns - attended. The shire court was primarily concerned  with issues of the larger landholders. Here the freemen  interpreted the customary law of the locality. The earl declared  the secular law and the bishop declared the spiritual law. They  also declared the sentence of the judges. The earl usually took a  third of the profits, such as fines and forfeits, of the shire  court, and the bishop took a share. In time, the earls each came  to supervise several shires and the sheriff became head of the  shire and assumed the earl's duties there, such as heading the  county fyrd. The shire court also heard cases which had been  refused justice at the hundred-mote and cases of keeping the peace  of the shire.    The hundred was a division of the shire, having come to refer to a  geographical area rather than a number of households. The monthly  hundred-mote could be attended by any freeman holding land (or a  lord's steward), but was usually attended only by reeve, thegns,  parish priest, and four representatives selected by each agrarian  community or village - usually villeins. Here transfers of land  were witnessed. A reeve, sometimes the sheriff, presided over  local criminal and peace and order issues [\"leet jurisdiction\",  which derived from sac and soc jurisdiction] and civil cases at  the hundred court. All residents were expected to attend the leet  court. The sheriff usually held each hundred court in turn. The  suitors to these courts were the same as those of the shire  courts. They were the judges who declared the law"]]]
