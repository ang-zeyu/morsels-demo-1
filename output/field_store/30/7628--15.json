But at last the battle ended, and the Harpies fled screaming toward the  south, and the sons of the North-wind rushed after them, and brought  clear sunshine where they passed.  For many a league they followed them,  over all the isles of the Cyclades, and away to the south-west across  Hellas, till they came to the Ionian Sea, and there they fell upon the  Echinades, at the mouth of the Achelous; and those isles were called the  Whirlwind Isles for many a hundred years.  But what became of Zetes and  Calais I know not, for the heroes never saw them again: and some say that  Heracles met them, and quarrelled with them, and slew them with his  arrows; and some say that they fell down from weariness and the heat of  the summer sun, and that the Sun-god buried them among the Cyclades, in  the pleasant Isle of Tenos; and for many hundred years their grave was  shown there, and over it a pillar, which turned to every wind.  But those  dark storms and whirlwinds haunt the Bosphorus until this day.    But the Argonauts went eastward, and out into the open sea, which we now  call the Black Sea, but it was called the Euxine then.  No Hellen had  ever crossed it, and all feared that dreadful sea, and its rocks, and  shoals, and fogs, and bitter freezing storms; and they told strange  stories of it, some false and some half-true, how it stretched northward  to the ends of the earth, and the sluggish Putrid Sea, and the  everlasting night, and the regions of the dead.  So the heroes trembled,  for all their courage, as they came into that wild Black Sea, and saw it  stretching out before them, without a shore, as far as eye could see.    And first Orpheus spoke, and warned them, 'We shall come now to the  wandering blue rocks; my mother warned me of them, Calliope, the immortal  muse.'    And soon they saw the blue rocks shining like spires and castles of gray  glass, while an ice-cold wind blew from them and chilled all the heroes'  hearts.  And as they neared they could see them heaving, as they rolled  upon the long sea-waves, crashing and grinding together, till the roar  went up to heaven.  The sea sprang up in spouts between them, and swept  round them in white sheets of foam; but their heads swung nodding high in  air, while the wind whistled shrill among the crags.    The heroes' hearts sank within them, and they lay upon their oars in  fear; but Orpheus called to Tiphys the helmsman, 'Between them we must  pass; so look ahead for an opening, and be brave, for Hera is with us.'  But Tiphys the cunning helmsman stood silent, clenching his teeth, till  he saw a heron come flying mast-high toward the rocks, and hover awhile  before them, as if looking for a passage through.  Then he cried, 'Hera  has sent us a pilot; let us follow the cunning bird.'    Then the heron flapped to and fro a moment, till he saw a hidden gap, and  into it he rushed like an arrow, while the heroes watched what would  befall.    And the blue rocks clashed together as the bird fled swiftly through; but  they struck but a feather from his tail, and then rebounded apart at the  shock.    Then Tiphys cheered the heroes, and they shouted; and the oars bent like  withes beneath their strokes as they rushed between those toppling  ice-crags and the cold blue lips of death.  And ere the rocks could meet  again they had passed them, and were safe out in the open sea.    And after that they sailed on wearily along the Asian coast, by the Black  Cape and Thyneis, where the hot stream of Thymbris falls into the sea,  and Sangarius, whose waters float on the Euxine, till they came to Wolf  the river, and to Wolf the kindly king.  And there died two brave heroes,  Idmon and Tiphys the wise helmsman: one died of an evil sickness, and one  a wild boar slew.  So the heroes heaped a mound above them, and set upon  it an oar on high, and left them there to sleep together, on the far-off  Lycian shore.  But Idas killed the boar, and avenged Tiphys; and Ancaios  took the rudder and was helmsman, and steered them on toward the east.    And they went on past Sinope, and many a mighty river's mouth, and past  many a barbarous tribe, and the cities of the Amazons, the warlike women  of the East, till all night they heard the clank of anvils and the roar  of furnace-blasts, and the forge-fires shone like sparks through the  darkness in the mountain glens aloft; for they were come to the shores of  the Chalybes, the smiths who never tire, but serve Ares the cruel  War-god, forging weapons day and night.    And at day-dawn they looked eastward, and midway between the sea and the  sky they saw white snow-peaks hanging, glittering sharp and bright above  the clouds.  And they knew that they were come to Caucasus, at the end of  all the earth: Caucasus the highest of all mountains, the father of the  rivers of the East.  On his peak lies chained the Titan, while a vulture  tears his heart; and at his feet are piled dark forests round the magic  Colchian land.    And they rowed three days to the eastward, while Caucasus rose higher  hour by hour, till they saw the dark stream of Phasis rushing headlong to  the sea, and, shining above the tree-tops, the golden roofs of King  Aietes, the child of the Sun.    Then out spoke Ancaios the helmsman, 'We are come to our goal at last,  for there are the roofs of Aietes, and the woods where all poisons grow;  but who can tell us where among them is hid the golden fleece?  Many a  toil must we bear ere we find it, and bring it home to Greece.'    But Jason cheered the heroes, for his heart was high and bold; and he  said, 'I will go alone up to Aietes, though he be the child of the Sun,  and win him with soft words.  Better so than to go altogether, and to  come to blows at once.'  But the Minuai would not stay behind, so they  rowed boldly up the stream.    And a dream came to Aietes, and filled his heart with fear.  He thought  he saw a shining star, which fell into his daughter's lap; and that  Medeia his daughter took it gladly, and carried it to the river-side, and  cast it in, and there the whirling river bore it down, and out into the  Euxine Sea.    Then he leapt up in fear, and bade his servants bring his chariot, that  he might go down to the river-side and appease the nymphs, and the heroes  whose spirits haunt the bank.  So he went down in his golden chariot, and  his daughters by his side, Medeia the fair witch-maiden, and Chalciope,  who had been Phrixus' wife, and behind him a crowd of servants and  soldiers, for he was a rich and mighty prince.    And as he drove down by the reedy river he saw _Argo_ sliding up beneath  the bank, and many a hero in her, like Immortals for beauty and for  strength, as their weapons glittered round them in the level morning  sunlight, through the white mist of the stream.  But Jason was the  noblest of all; for Hera, who loved him, gave him beauty and tallness and  terrible manhood.    And when they came near together and looked into each other's eyes the  heroes were awed before Aietes as he shone in his chariot, like his  father the glorious Sun; for his robes were of rich gold tissue, and the  rays of his diadem flashed fire; and in his hand he bore a jewelled  sceptre, which glittered like the stars; and sternly he looked at them  under his brows, and sternly he spoke and loud--    'Who are you, and what want you here, that you come to the shore of  Cutaia?  Do you take no account of my rule, nor of my people the  Colchians who serve me, who never tired yet in the battle, and know well  how to face an invader?'    And the heroes sat silent awhile before the face of that ancient king.  But Hera the awful goddess put courage into Jason's heart, and he rose  and shouted loudly in answer, 'We are no pirates nor lawless men.  We  come not to plunder and to ravage, or carry away slaves from your land;  but my uncle, the son of Poseidon, Pelias the Minuan king, he it is who  has set me on a quest to bring home the golden fleece.  And these too, my  bold comrades, they are no nameless men; for some are the sons of  Immortals, and some of heroes far renowned.  And we too never tire in  battle, and know well how to give blows and to take: yet we wish to be  guests at your table: it will be better so for both.'    Then Aietes' race rushed up like a whirlwind, and his eyes flashed fire  as he heard; but he crushed his anger down in his breast, and spoke  mildly a cunning speech--    'If you will fight for the fleece with my Colchians, then many a man must  die.  But do you indeed expect to win from me the fleece in fight?  So  few you are that if you be worsted I can load your ship with your  corpses.  But if you will be ruled by me, you will find it better far to  choose the best man among you, and let him fulfil the labours which I  demand.  Then I will give him the golden fleece for a prize and a glory  to you all.'    So saying, he turned his horses and drove back in silence to the town.  And the Minuai sat silent with sorrow, and longed for Heracles and his  strength; for there was no facing the thousands of the Colchians and the  fearful chance of war.    But Chalciope, Phrixus' widow, went weeping to the town; for she  remembered her Minuan husband, and all the pleasures of her youth, while  she watched the fair faces of his kinsmen, and their long locks of golden  hair.  And she whispered to Medeia her sister, 'Why should all these  brave men die? why does not my father give them up the fleece, that my  husband's spirit may have rest?'    And Medeia's heart pitied the heroes, and Jason most of all; and she  answered, 'Our father is stern and terrible, and who can win the golden  fleece?'  But Chalciope said, 'These men are not like our men; there is  nothing which they cannot dare nor do.'    And Medeia thought of Jason and his brave countenance, and said, 'If  there was one among them who knew no fear, I could show him how to win  the fleece.'

Then may those flames burn in thy bosom  to all eternity! Avaunt, monster! Never let me see thee again in my  troop! What! Do you murmur? Do you hesitate? Who dares hesitate when  I command? Away with him, I say! And there are others among you ripe  for my vengeance. I know thee, Spiegelberg. But I will step in among  you ere long, and hold a fearful muster-roll.                         [Exeunt, trembling.]    CHARLES (alone, walking up and down in great agitation). Hear them not,  thou avenger in heaven! How can I avert it? Art thou to blame, great  God, if thy engines, pestilence, and famine, and floods, overwhelm the  just with the unjust? Who can stay the flame, which is kindled to  destroy the hornet's nest, from extending to the blessed harvest? Oh!  fie on the slaughter of women, and children, and the sick! How this  deed weighs me down! It has poisoned my fairest achievements! There he  stands, poor fool, abashed and disgraced in the sight of heaven; the boy  that presumed to wield Jove's thunder, and overthrew pigmies when he  should have crushed Titans. Go, go! 'tis not for thee, puny son of  clay, to wield the avenging sword of sovereign justice! Thou didst fail  at thy first essay. Here, then, I renounce the audacious scheme. I go  to hide myself in some deep cleft of the earth, where no daylight will  be witness of my shame. (He is about to fly.)                Enter a ROBBER hurriedly.    ROBBER. Look out, captain! There is mischief in the wind! Whole  detachments of Bohemian cavalry are scouring the forests. That infernal  bailiff must have betrayed us.                  Enter more ROBBERS.    2D ROBBER. Captain! captain! they have tracked us! Some thousands of  them are forming a cordon round the middle forest.                Enter more ROBBERS again.    3D ROBBER. Woe, woe, woe! we are all taken, hanged drawn, and  quartered. Thousands of hussars, dragoons, and chasseurs are mustering  on the heights, and guard all the passes.                       [Exit CHARLES VON MOOR.]         Enter SCHWEITZER, GRIMM, ROLLER, SCHWARZ, SCHUFTERLE,          SPIEGELBERG, RAZMAN, and the whole troop.    SCHWEITZER. Ha! Have we routed them out of their feather-beds at last?  Come, be jolly, Roller! I have long wished to have a bout with those  knights of the bread-basket. Where is the captain? Is the whole troop  assembled? I hope we have powder enough?    RAZ. Powder, I believe you; but we are only eighty in all and therefore  scarcely one to twenty.    SCHWEITZER. So much the better! And though there were fifty against  my great toe-nail--fellows who have waited till we lit the straw under  their very seats. Brother, brother, there is nothing to fear. They  sell their lives for tenpence; and are we not fighting for our necks?  We will pour into them like a deluge, and fire volleys upon their heads  like crashes of thunder. But where the devil is the captain.    SPIEGEL. He forsakes us in this extremity. Is there no hope of escape?    SCHWEITZER. Escape?    SPIEGEL. Oh, that I had tarried in Jerusalem!    SCHWEITZER. I wish you were choked in a cesspool, you paltry coward!  With defenceless nuns you are a mighty man; but at sight of a pair of  fists a confirmed sneak! Now show your courage or you shall be sewn up  alive in an ass's hide and baited to death with dogs.    RAZ. The captain! the captain!            Enter CHARLES (speaking slowly to himself).    CHARLES. I have allowed them to be hemmed in on every side. Now they  must fight with the energy of despair. (Aloud.) Now my boys! now for  it! We must fight like wounded boars, or we are utterly lost!    SCHWEITZER. Ha! I'll rip them open with my tusks, till their entrails  protrude by the yard! Lead on, captain! we will follow you into the  very jaws of death.    CHARLES. Charge all your arms! You've plenty of powder, I hope?    SCHWEITZER (with energy). Powder? ay, enough to blow the earth up to  the moon.    RAZ. Every one of us has five brace of pistols, ready loaded, and three  carbines to boot.    CHARLES. Good! good! Now some of you must climb up the trees, or  conceal yourselves in the thickets, and some fire upon them in ambush--    SCHWEITZER. That part will suit you, Spiegelberg.    CHARLES. The rest will follow me, and fall upon their flanks like  furies.    SCHWEITZER. There will I be!    CHARLES. At the same time let every man make his whistle ring through  the forest, and gallop about in every direction, so that our numbers may  appear the more formidable. And let all the dogs be unchained, and set  on upon their ranks, that they may be broken and dispersed and run in  the way of our fire. We three, Roller, Schweitzer, and myself, will  fight wherever the fray is hottest.    SCHWEITZER. Masterly! excellent! We will so bewilder them with balls  that they shall not know whence the salutes are coming. I have more  than once shot away a cherry from the mouth. Only let them come on  (SCHUFTERLE is pulling SCHWEITZER; the latter takes the captain aside,  and entreats him in a low voice.)    CHARLES. Silence!    SCHWEITZER. I entreat you--    CHARLES. Away! Let him have the benefit of his disgrace; it has saved  him. He shall not die on the same field with myself, my Schweitzer, and  my Roller. Let him change his apparel, and I will say he is a traveller  whom I have plundered. Make yourself easy, Schweitzer. Take my word  for it he will be hanged yet.                 Enter FATHER DOMINIC.    FATHER DOM. (to himself, starts). Is this the dragon's nest? With your  leave, sirs! I am a servant of the church; and yonder are seventeen  hundred men who guard every hair of my head.    SCHWEITZER. Bravo! bravo! Well spoken to keep his courage warm.    CHARLES. Silence, comrade! Will you tell us briefly, good father, what  is your errand here?    FATHER Dom. I am delegated by the high justices, on whose sentence  hangs life or death--ye thieves--ye incendiaries--ye villains--ye  venomous generation of vipers, crawling about in the dark, and stinging  in secret--ye refuse of humanity--brood of hell--food for ravens and  worms--colonists for the gallows and the wheel--    SCHWEITZER. Dog! a truce with your foul tongue! or ------  (He holds the butt-end of his gun before FATHER DOMINIC'S face.)    CHARLES. Fie, fie, Schweitzer! You cut the thread of his discourse.  He has got his sermon so nicely by heart. Pray go on, Sir! \"for the  gallows and the wheel?\"    FATHER Dom. And thou, their precious captain!--commander-in-chief of  cut-purses!--king of sharpers! Grand Mogul of all the rogues under the  sun!--great prototype of that first hellish ringleader who imbued a  thousand legions of innocent angels with the flame of rebellion, and  drew them down with him into the bottomless pit of damnation! The  agonizing cries of bereaved mothers pursue thy footsteps! Thou drinkest  blood like water! and thy murderous knife holds men cheaper than  air-bubbles!    CHARLES. Very true--exceedingly true! Pray proceed, Sir!    FATHER DOM. What do you mean? Very true--exceedingly true! Is that an  answer?    CHARLES. How, Sir? You were not prepared for that, it seems? Go on--  by all means go on. What more were you going to say?    FATHER DOM. (heated). Abominable wretch! Avaunt! Does not the blood  of a murdered count of the empire cling to thy accursed fingers? Hast  thou not, with sacrilegious hands, dared to break into the Lord's  sanctuary, and carry off the consecrated vessels of the _sanctissimum_?  Hast thou not flung firebrands into our godly city, and brought down the  powder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians? (Clasps his  hands). Horrible, horrible wickedness! that stinketh in the nostrils of  Heaven, and provoketh the day of judgment to burst upon you suddenly!  ripe for retribution--rushing headlong to the last trump!    CHARLES. Masterly guesses thus far! But now, sir, to the point! What  is it that the right worshipful justices wish to convey to me through  you?    FATHER Dom. What you are not worthy to receive. Look around you,  incendiary! As far as your eye can reach you are environed by our  horsemen--there is no chance of escape. As surely as cherries grow on  these oaks, and peaches on these firs, so surely shall you turn your  backs upon these oaks and these firs in safety.    CHARLES. Do you hear that, Schweitzer? But go on!    FATHER DOM. Hear, then, what mercy and forbearance justice shows  towards such miscreants. If you instantly prostrate yourselves in  submission and sue for mercy and forgiveness, then severity itself will  relent to compassion, and justice be to thee an indulgent mother. She  will shut one eye upon your horrible crimes, and be satisfied--only  think!--to let you be broken on the wheel.    SCHWEITZER. Did you hear that, captain? Shall I throttle this  well-trained shepherd's cur till the red blood spurts from every pore?    ROLLER. Captain! Fire and fury! Captain! How he bites his lip!  Shall I topple this fellow upside down like a ninepin?    SCHWEITZER. Mine, mine be the job! Let me kneel to you, captain; let  me implore you! I beseech you to grant me the delight of pounding him  to a jelly! (FATHER DOMINIC screams.)    CHARLES. Touch him not! Let no one lay a finger on him!--(To FATHER  DOMINIC, drawing his sword.) Hark ye, sir father! Here stand  nine-and-seventy men, of whom I am the captain, and not one of them has  been taught to trot at a signal, or learned to dance to the music of  artillery; while yonder stand seventeen hundred men grown gray under the  musket. But now listen! Thus says Moor, the captain of incendiaries. It  is true I have slain a count of the empire, burnt and plundered the  church of St. Dominic, flung firebrands into your bigoted city, and  brought down the powder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians. But  that is not all,--I have done more. (He holds out his right hand.) Do you  observe these four costly rings, "]]]
