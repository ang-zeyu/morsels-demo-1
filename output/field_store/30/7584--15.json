I've  been all over that with the parson last evening; and he says there  isn't a new family in the place, and all the old ones have their homes,  the same as ever. So we can turn the key and leave it with a clear  conscience.\"    Polly drew a long breath of delight, and gazed long at the face of the  stove that seemed to crackle out an answering note of joy as the wood  snapped merrily; then she slowly looked around the kitchen.    \"It's so perfectly lovely, Mamsie,\" she broke out at length, \"to see  the dear old things, and to know that they are waiting here for us to  come back whenever we want to. And to think it isn't wicked not to have  them used, because everybody has all they need; oh! it's so delicious  to think they can be left to themselves.\"    She folded her hands now across her knees, and drew another long breath  of content.    Phronsie stole out of the bedroom, and came slowly up to her mother's  side, pausing a bit on the way to look into Polly's absorbed face.    \"I don't think, Mamsie,\" she said quietly, \"that people ought to be so  very good who've never had a little brown house; never in all their  lives.\"    \"Oh, yes, they had, child,\" said Mrs. Pepper briskly; \"places don't  make any difference. It's people's duty to be good wherever they are.\"    But Phronsie's face expressed great incredulity.    \"I'm always going to live here when I am a big, grown-up woman,\" she  declared, slowly gazing around the kitchen, \"and I shall never, never  go out of Badgertown.\"    \"Oh, Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly, turning around in dismay, \"why, you  couldn't do that. Just think, child, whatever in the world would  Grandpapa do, or any of us, pray tell?\"    \"Grandpapa would come here,\" declared Phronsie decidedly, and shaking  her yellow head to enforce her statement. \"Of course Grandpapa would  come here, Polly. We couldn't live without him.\"    \"That's it,\" said Polly, with a corresponding shake of her brown head,  \"of course we couldn't live without Grandpapa; and just as 'of course'  he couldn't leave his own dear home. He never would be happy, Phronsie,  to do that.\"    Phronsie took a step or two into the sunshine lying on the middle of  the old kitchen floor. \"Then I'd rather not come, Polly,\" she said. But  she sighed and Polly was just about saying, \"We'll run down now and  then perhaps, Phronsie, as we have done now,\" when the door was thrown  open suddenly, and Joel burst in, his face as white as a sheet, and  working fearfully.    \"Oh, Polly! you must tell Mrs. Whitney--I can't.\"    Polly sprang to her feet; Mrs. Pepper, who had just stepped into the  pantry, was saying, \"I think, Polly, I'll make some apple dumplings,  the boys like them so much.\"    \"What is it, Joe?\" cried Polly hoarsely, and standing quite still.  Phronsie, with wide eyes, went up and took the boy's cold hand, and  gazed into his face as he leaned against the door.    \"Dick!\" groaned Joel; \"oh! oh! I can't bear it,\" and covering his face  with one hand, he would have pulled the other from Phronsie's warm  little palm, but she held it fast.    \"Tell me at once, Joe,\" commanded Polly. \"Hush!--mother\"--but Mrs.  Pepper was already out of the pantry.    \"Joel,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"whatever it is, tell us immediately.\"    The look in her black eyes forced him to gasp in one breath, \"Dick fell  off the double ripper, and both of his legs are broken--may be not,\" he  added in a loud scream.    Phronsie still held the boy's hand. He was conscious of it, and that  she uttered no word, and then he knew no more.    \"Leave him to me, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, through drawn lips, \"and  then do you run as you have never run before, to the parsonage. Oh! if  they should bring him there before the mother hears.\"    Phronsie dropped the hand she held, and running on unsteady little feet  into the bedroom, came back with Polly's hood and coat.    \"Let me go,\" cried Polly wildly, rushing away from the detaining hand  to the door, \"I don't want those things on. Let me go, Phronsie!\"    \"You'll be cold,\" said Phronsie. With all her care, her little white  lips were quivering as she held out the things. \"Please, Polly,\" she  said piteously.    \"The child is right; put them on,\" commanded Mrs. Pepper, for one  instant taking her thought from her boy; and Polly obeyed, and was gone.    In the parsonage \"best room\" sat Mrs. Whitney. Her rocking-chair was  none of the easiest, being a hair-cloth affair, its cushion very much  elevated in the world just where it should have been depressed, so that  one was in constant danger of slipping off its surface; moreover, the  arms and back of the chair were covered with indescribable arrangements  made and presented by loving parishioners and demanding unceasing  attention from the occupant. But the chair was drawn up in the sunshine  pouring into the window, and Mrs. Whitney's thoughts were sunny, too;  for she smiled now and then as she drew her needle busily in and out  through the bright wools.    \"How restful it all is here, and so quaint and simple.\" She glanced up  now to the high-backed mantel with its wealth of daguerreotypes, and  surprising collection of dried leaves in tall china vases; and over the  walls, adorned with pine-cone framed pictures, to the center table  loaded with \"Annuals,\" and one or two volumes of English poetry, and  then her gaze took in the little paths the winter sunshine was making  for itself along the red and green ingrain carpet. \"I am so glad father  thought to bring us all. Dear father, it is making a new man of him,  this winter frolic. Why\"--    She was looking out of the window now, and her hands fell to her lap as  Polly Pepper came running breathlessly down the village street, her  hood untied, and the coat grasped with one hand and held together  across her breast. But it was the face that terrified Mrs. Whitney, and  hurrying out of her chair, she ran out to the veranda as the girl  rushed through the gateway.    \"Polly, child,\" cried Mrs. Whitney, seizing her with loving arms and  drawing her on the steps--\"oh! what is it, dear?\"    Polly's lips moved, but no words came.    \"Oh!\" at last, \"don't hate us for--bringing you to the--little--brown  house. Why did we come!\" And convulsively she threw her young arms  around the kind neck. \"Oh, Auntie! Dicky is hurt--but we don't know how  much--his legs, Joel says, but it may not be as bad as we think; dear  Auntie.\"    Mrs. Whitney trembled so that she could scarcely stand. Around them  streamed the same winter sunshine that had been so bright a moment  since. How long ago it seemed. And out of gathering clouds in her heart  she was saying, \"Polly dear, God is good. We will trust him.\" She did  not know her own voice, nor realize when Polly led her mercifully  within, as a farmer's wagon came slowly down the street, to stop at the  parsonage gate; nor even when Dick was brought in, white and still,  could she think of him as her boy. It was some other little figure, and  she must go and help them care for him. Her boy would come bounding in  presently, happy and ruddy, with a kiss for mamma, and a world of happy  nonsense, just as usual. It was only when Mrs. Henderson came in, and  took her hand to lead her into the next room, that it all came to her.    \"Oh, Dick!\" and she sprang to the side of the sofa where he lay. \"My  child--my child!\"    And then came Dr. Fisher, and the truth was known. One of Dick's legs  was broken below the knee; the other badly bruised. Only Jasper and the  mother remained in the room while the little doctor set the limb; and  after what seemed an age to the watchers, the boy came out.    \"He bore it like a Trojan,\" declared Jasper, wiping his forehead. \"I  tell you, Dick's our hero, after this.\"    \"Now I should like to know how all this happened,\" demanded Mr. King.  The old gentleman had remained at the parsonage to get a good morning  nap while the snow frolic was in progress. And he had been awakened by  the unusual bustle below stairs in time to hear the welcome news that  Dicky was all right since Dr. Fisher was taking care of him. He now  presented himself in his dressing-gown, with his sleeping cap awry,  over a face in which anger, distress and impatience strove for the  mastery. \"Speak up, my boy,\" to Jasper, \"and tell us what you know  about it.\"    \"Well, the first thing I knew of any danger ahead,\" said Jasper, \"was  hearing Dick sing out 'Hold up!' I supposed the double ripper all  right; didn't you, Ben?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ben sturdily, \"and it was all right; just exactly as we  used to make them, we boys; there wasn't a weak spot anywhere in her,  sir.\"    \"Who was steering?\" demanded old Mr. King almost fiercely.    \"I was,\" said Van, beginning boldly enough, to let his voice die out in  a tremulous effort.    \"Humph--humph,\" responded Mr. King grimly. \"A bad business,\" shaking  his head.    \"Van would\"--began Percy, but his eye meeting Polly's he added, \"We'd  none of us done any better, I don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#14)"],[1,"         When matter we fore-know,       Words voluntarie flow.    As one said, as poetically in his prose, Cum res animum occupavere,  verba ambiunt; [Footnote: SED. Controv. 1. vii. prae.] \"When matter  hath possest their minds, they hunt after words:\" and another: Ipsa  res verba rapiunt: [Footnote: CIC. de Fin. I. iii. c. 5.] \"Things  themselves will catch and carry words:\" He knowes neither Ablative,  Conjunctive, Substantive, nor Gramar, no more doth his Lackey, nor  any Oyster-wife about the streets, and yet if you have a mind to it  he will intertaine you, your fill, and peradventure stumble as  little and as seldome against the rules of his tongue, as the best  Master of arts in France. He hath no skill in Rhetoricke, nor can he  with a preface fore-stall and captivate the Gentle Readers good  will: nor careth he greatly to know it. In good sooth, all this  garish painting is easilie defaced, by the lustre of an in-bred and  simple truth; for these dainties and quaint devices serve but to  ammuse the vulgar sort; unapt and incapable to taste the most solid  and firme meat: as Afer verie plainly declareth in Cornelius  Tacitus. The Ambassadours of Samos being come to Cleomenes King of  Sparta, prepared with a long prolix Oration, to stir him up to war  against the tyrant Policrates, after he had listned a good while  unto them, his answer was: \"Touching your Exordium or beginning I  have forgotten it; the middle I remember not; and for your  conclusion I will do nothing in it.\" A fit, and (to my thinking) a  verie good answer; and the Orators were put to such a shift; as they  knew not what to replie. And what said another? the Athenians from  out two of their cunning Architects, were to chuse one to erect a  notable great frame; the one of them more affected and selfe  presuming, presented himselfe before them, with a smooth fore-  premeditated discourse, about the subject of that piece of worke,  and thereby drew the judgements of the common people unto his  liking; but the other in few words spake thus: \"Lords of Athens,  what this man hath said I will performe.\" In the greatest  earnestnesse of Ciceroes eloquence many were drawn into a kind of  admiration; But Cato jesting at it, said, \"Have we not a pleasant  Consull?\" A quicke cunning Argument, and a wittie saying, whether it  go before or come after, it is never out of season. If it have no  coherence with that which goeth before, nor with what commeth after;  it is good and commendable in it selfe. I am none of those that  think a good Ryme, to make a good Poeme; let him hardly (if so he  please) make a short syllable long, it is no great matter; if the  invention be rare and good, and his wit and judgement have cunningly  played their part. I will say to such a one; he is a good Poet, but  an ill Versifier.         Emunciae naris, durus componere versus.       [Footnote: HOR. 1. i. Sat. iv.]         A man whose sense could finely pierce,       But harsh and hard to make a verse.    Let a man (saith Horace) make his worke loose all seames, measures,  and joynts.     Tempora certa moddsque, et quod prius ordine verbum est,   [Footnote: Ib. 58.]   Posterius facias, praeponens ultima primis:   Invenias etiam disjecti membra Poetae.   [Footnote: Ib. 62.]     Set times and moods, make you the first word last,   The last word first, as if they were new cast:   Yet find th' unjoynted Poets joints stand fast.    He shall for all that, nothing gain-say himselfe, every piece will  make a good shew. To this purpose answered Menander those that chid  him, the day being at hand, in which he had promised a Comedy, and  had not begun the same, \"Tut-tut,\" said he, \"it is alreadie  finished, there wanteth nothing but to adde the verse unto it;\" for,  having ranged and cast the plot in his mind, he made small accompt  of feet, of measures, or cadences of verses, which indeed are but of  small import in regard of the rest. Since great Ronsarde and learned  Bellay have raised our French Poesie unto that height of honour  where it now is: I see not one of these petty ballad-makers, or  prentise dogrell rymers, that doth not bombast his labours with  high-swelling and heaven-disimbowelling words, and that doth not  marshall his cadences verie neere as they doe. Plus sonat quam  valet. [Footnote: Sen, Epist. xl.] \"The sound is more than the  weight or worth.\" And for the vulgar sort there were never so many  Poets, and so few good: but as it hath been easie for them to  represent their rymes, so come they far short in imitating the rich  descriptions of the one, and rare inventions of the other. But what  shall he doe, if he be urged with sophisticall subtilties about a  Sillogisme? A gammon of Bacon makes a man drink, drinking quencheth  a mans thirst; Ergo, a gammon of bacon quencheth a mans thirst. Let  him mock at it, it is more wittie to be mockt at than to be  answered. Let him borrow this pleasant counter-craft of Aristippus;  \"Why shall I unbind that, which being bound doth so much trouble  me?\" Some one proposed certaine Logicall quiddities against  Cleanthes, to whom Chrisippus said; use such jugling tricks to play  with children, and divert not the serious thoughts of an aged man to  such idle matters. If such foolish wiles, Contorta et aculeata  sophismata, [Footnote: Cic. Acad. Qu. 1. iv.] \"Intricate and stinged  sophismes,\" must perswade a lie, it is dangerous: but if they proove  void of any effect, and move him but to laughter, I see not why he  shall beware of them. Some there are so foolish that will go a  quarter of a mile out of the way to hunt after a quaint new word, if  they once get in chace; Aut qui non verba rebus aptant, sed res  extrinsecus arcessunt, quibus verba conveniant: \"Or such as fit not  words to matter, but fetch matter from abroad, whereto words be  fitted.\" And another, Qui alicujus verbi decore placentis, vocentur  ad id quod non proposuerant scribere: [Footnote: Sen. Epist. liii.]  \"Who are allured by the grace of some pleasing word, to write what  they intended not to write.\" I doe more willingly winde up a wittie  notable sentence, that so I may sew it upon me, than unwinde my  thread to go fetch it. Contrariwise, it is for words to serve and  wait upon the matter, and not for matter to attend upon words, and  if the French tongue cannot reach unto it, let the Gaskonie, or any  other. I would have the matters to surmount, and so fill the  imagination of him that harkeneth, that he have no remembrance at  all of the words. It is a naturall, simple, and unaffected speech  that I love, so written as it is spoken, and such upon the paper, as  it is in the mouth, a pithie, sinnowie, full, strong, compendious  and materiall speech, not so delicate and affected as vehement and  piercing.         Hac demum sapiet dictio qua feriet.       [Footnote: Epitaph on Lucan, 6.]         In fine, that word is wisely fit,       Which strikes the fence, the marke doth hit.    Rather difficult than tedious, void of affection, free, loose and  bold, that every member of it seeme to make a bodie; not  Pedanticall, nor Frier-like, nor Lawyer-like, but rather downe  right, Souldier-like. As Suetonius calleth that of Julius Caesar,  which I see no reason wherefore he calleth it. I have sometimes  pleased myselfe in imitating that licenciousnesse or wanton humour  of our youths, in wearing of their garments; as carelessly to let  their cloaks hang downe over one shoulder; to weare their cloakes  scarfe or bawdrikewise, and their stockings loose hanging about  their legs. It represents a kind of disdainful fiercenesse of these  forraine embellishings, and neglect carelesnesse of art: But I  commend it more being imployed in the course and forme of speech.  All manner of affectation, namely [Footnote: Especially,] in the  livelinesse and libertie of France, is unseemely in a Courtier. And  in a Monarchie every Gentleman ought to addresse himselfe unto  [Footnote: Aim at] a Courtiers carriage. Therefore do we well  somewhat to incline to a native and carelesse behaviour. I like not  a contexture, where the seames and pieces may be seen: As in a well  compact bodie, what need a man distinguish and number all the bones  and veines severally? Quae veritati operam dat oratio, incomposita  sit et simplex [Footnote: Sen. Epist. xl] Quis accurate loquitur  nisi qui vult putide loqui [Footnote: Ib. Epist. ixxr.] \"The speach  that intendeth truth must be plaine and unpollisht: Who speaketh  elaborately, but he that meanes to speake unfavourably?\" That  eloquence offereth injurie unto things, which altogether drawes us  to observe it. As in apparell, it is a signe of pusillanimitie for  one to marke himselfe, in some particular and unusuall fashion: so  likewise in common speech, for one to hunt after new phrases, and  unaccustomed quaint words, proceedeth of a scholasticall and  childish ambition. Let me use none other than are spoken in the hals  of Paris. Aristophanes the Gramarian was somewhat out of the way,  when he reproved Epicurus, for the simplicitie of his words, and the  end of his art oratorie, which was onely perspicuitie in speech. The  imitation of speech, by reason of the facilitie of it, followeth  presently a whole nation. The imitation of judging and inventing  comes more slow. The greater number of Readers, because they have  found one self-same kind of gowne, suppose most falsely to holde one  like bodie. Outward garments and cloakes may be borrowed, but never  the sinews and strength of the bodie. Most of those that converse  with me, speake like unto these Essayes; but I know not whether they  think alike. The Athenians (as Plato averreth) have for their part  great care to be fluent and eloquent in their speech; The  Lacedemonians endevour to be short and compendious; and those of  Creet labour more to bee plentifull in conceits than in language.  And these are the best. Zeno was wont to say, \"That he had two sorts  of disciples; the"]]]
