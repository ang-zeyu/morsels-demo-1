And as the poultry  was by this time gone to roost, he went up to the perch which was behind  the stove, and reached down the cock, and put it under the arm of the  maid, who was just come to call me away.    Not for all the world, however, would I have eaten the cock, but I turned  it out to breed. I went to him once more, and asked whether I should give  thanks to the Lord next Sunday for his recovery; whereupon he answered  that I might do as I pleased in the matter. Hereat I shook my head, and  left the house, resolving to send for him as soon as ever I should hear  that his old Lizzie was from home (for she often went to fetch flax to  spin from the Sheriff). But mark what befell within a few days! We heard  an outcry that old Seden was missing, and that no one could tell what had  become of him. His wife thought he had gone up into the Streckelberg,  whereupon the accursed witch ran howling to our house and asked my  daughter whether she had not seen anything of her goodman, seeing that she  went up the mountain every day. My daughter said she had not; but, woe is  me, she was soon to hear enough of him; for one morning, before sunrise,  as she came down into the wood on her way back from her forbidden digging  after amber, she heard a woodpecker (which no doubt was old Lizzie  herself) crying so dolefully, close beside her, that she went in among the  bushes to see what was the matter. There was the woodpecker sitting on the  ground before a bunch of hair, which was red, and just like what old  Seden's had been, and as soon as it espied her it flew up, with its beak  full of the hair and slipped into a hollow tree. While my daughter still  stood looking at this devil's work, up came old Paasch--who also had heard  the cries of the woodpecker, as he was cutting roofing shingles on the  mountain, with his boy--and was likewise struck with horror when he saw  the hair on the ground. At first they thought a wolf must have eaten him,  and searched all about, but could not find a single bone. On looking up  they fancied they saw something red at the very top of the tree, so they  made the boy climb up, and he forthwith cried out that here, too, there  was a great bunch of red hair stuck to some leaves as if with pitch, but  that it was not pitch, but something speckled red and white, like  fishguts; _item_, that the leaves all around, even where there was no  hair, were stained and spotted, and had a very ill smell. Hereupon the  lad, at his master's bidding, threw down the clotted branch, and they two  below straightway judged that this was the hair and brains of old Seden,  and that the devil had carried him off bodily, because he would not pray  nor give thanks to the Lord for his recovery. I myself believed the same,  and told it on the Sunday as a warning to the congregation. But further on  it will be seen that the Lord had yet greater cause for giving him into  the hands of Satan, inasmuch as he had been talked over by his wicked wife  to renounce his Maker in the hopes of getting better. Now, however, this  devil's whore did as if her heart was broken, tearing out her red hair by  whole handsful when she heard about the woodpecker from my child and old  Paasch, and bewailing that she was now a poor widow, and who was to take  care of her for the future, etc.    Meanwhile we celebrated on this barren shore, as best we could and might,  together with the whole Protestant Church, the 25th day _mensis Junii_,  whereon, one hundred years ago, the Estates of the holy Roman Empire laid  their confession before the most high and mighty Emperor Carolus V., at  Augsburg; and I preached a sermon on Matt. x. 32, of the right confession  of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, whereupon the whole congregation  came to the Sacrament. Now, towards the evening of the selfsame day, as I  walked with my daughter by the sea-shore, we saw several hundred sail of  ships, both great and small, round about Ruden, and plainly heard firing,  whereupon we judged forthwith that this must be the most high and mighty  King Gustavus Adolphus, who was now coming, as he had promised, to the aid  of poor persecuted Christendom. While we were still debating, a boat  sailed towards us from Oie wherein was Kate Berow her son, who is a farmer  there, and was coming to see his old mother. The same told us that it  really was the king, who had this morning run before Ruden with his fleet  from Ruegen; that a few men of Oie were fishing there at the time, and saw  how he went ashore with his officers, and straightway bared his head and  fell upon his knees.    Thus, then, most gracious God, did I thy unworthy servant enjoy a still  greater happiness and delight that blessed evening than I had done on the  blessed morn; and any one may think that I delayed not for a moment to  fall on my knees with my child, and to follow the example of the king. And  God knows I never in my life prayed so fervently as that evening, whereon  the Lord showed such a wondrous sign upon us as to cause the deliverer of  his poor Christian people to come among them on the very day when they had  everywhere called upon him, on their knees, for his gracious help against  the murderous wiles of the Pope and the devil. That night I could not  sleep for joy, but went quite early in the morning to Damerow, where  something had befallen Vithe his boy. I supposed that he, too, was  bewitched; but this time it was not witchcraft, seeing that the boy had  eaten something unwholesome in the forest. He could not tell what kind of  berries they were; but the _malum_, which turned all his skin bright  scarlet, soon passed over. As I therefore was returning home shortly  after, I met a messenger from Peenemuende, whom his Majesty the high and  mighty King Gustavus Adolphus had sent to tell the Sheriff that on the  29th of June, at ten o'clock in the morning, he was to send three guides  to meet his Majesty at Coserow, and to guide him through the woods to  Swine, where the Imperialists were encamped. _Item_, he related how his  Majesty had taken the fort at Peenemuende yesterday (doubtless the cause of  the firing we heard last evening), and that the Imperialists had run away  as fast as they could, and played the bushranger properly; for after  setting their camp on fire they all fled into the woods and coppices, and  part escaped to Wolgast and part to Swine.    Straightway I resolved in my joy to invent a _carmen gratulatorium_ to his  Majesty, whom, by the grace of Almighty God, I was to see, the which my  little daughter might present to him.    I accordingly proposed it to her as soon as I got home, and she  straightway fell on my neck for joy, and then began to dance about the  room. But when she had considered a little, she thought her clothes were  not good enough to wear before his Majesty, and that I should buy her a  blue silk gown, with a yellow apron, seeing that these were the Swedish  colours, and would please his Majesty right well. For a long time I would  not, seeing that I hate this kind of pride; but she teased me with her  kisses and coaxing words, till I, like an old fool, said yes, and ordered  my ploughman to drive her over to Wolgast to-day to buy the stuff.  Wherefore I think that the just God, who hateth the proud, and showeth  mercy on the humble, did rightly chastise me for such pride. For I myself  felt a sinful pleasure when she came back with two women who were to help  her to sew, and laid the stuff before me. Next day she set to work at  sunrise to sew, and I composed my _carmen_ the while. I had not got very  far in it when the young Lord Ruediger of Nienkerken came riding up, in  order, as he said, to inquire whether his Majesty were indeed going to  march through Coserow. And when I told him all I knew of the matter,  _item_ informed him of our plan, he praised it exceedingly, and instructed  my daughter (who looked more kindly upon him to-day than I altogether  liked) how the Swedes use to pronounce the Latin, as _ratscho_ pro _ratio,  uet_ pro _ut, schis_ pro _scis_, etc., so that she might be able to answer  his Majesty with all due readiness. He said, moreover, that he had held  much converse with Swedes at Wittenberg, as well as at Griepswald,  wherefore if she pleased they might act a short _colloquium_, wherein he  would play the king. Hereupon he sat down on the bench before her, and  they both began chattering together, which vexed me sore, especially when  I saw that she made but small haste with her needle the while. But say,  dear reader, what was I to do? Wherefore I went my ways, and let them  chatter till near noon, when the young lord at last took leave. But he  promised to come again on Tuesday, when the king was here, and believed  that the whole island would flock together at Coserow. As soon as he was  gone, seeing that my _vena poetica_ (as may be easily guessed) was still  stopped up, I had the horses put to and drove all over the parish,  exhorting the people in every village to be at the Giant's Stone by  Coserow at nine o'clock on Tuesday, and that they were all to fall on  their knees as soon as they should see the king coming and that I knelt  down; _item_, to join at once in singing the Ambrosian hymn of praise,  which I should lead off as soon as the bells began to ring. This they all  promised to do; and after I had again exhorted them to it on Sunday in  church, and prayed to the Lord for his Majesty out of the fulness of my  heart, we scarce could await the blessed Tuesday for joyful impatience.          _The Fifteenth Chapter_      OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE HIGH AND MIGHTY KING GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS AND WHAT  BEFELL THEREAT    Meanwhile I finished my _carmen_ in _metrum elegiacum_, which my daughter  transcribed (seeing that her handwriting is fairer than mine) and  diligently learned, so that she might say it to his Majesty. _Item_, her  clothes were gotten ready, and became her purely; and on Monday she went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#14)"],[1,"saying what concessions  he may extort. Of all princes in Europe I had rather Harold had  fallen into the hands of any other than into those of William of  Normandy.\"    \"Truly I have never troubled my head about such matters, Wulf, and  thought that it would be time to do so when I became a thane, and  had a vote at the Witan.\"    \"I have heard much of them from the prior of Bramber, who is a true  Englishman, and though a priest, learned in all matters that appertain  to the history of times past and of our own; he impressed upon me  that just as a boy must practise arms if he is to bear them worthily  as a man, so he should study the story of our kings, and learn what  is passing, not only in our own country but in others, if he is  ever to raise his voice in council.\"    Harold and his thanes sat apart discussing the position, their  conclusion being very similar to that arrived at by Wulf. Chivalry  had but slight influence as yet in the West of Europe. Kings and  princes cared little as to the means by which they attained an end.  Rivals to a throne were put out of the way without scruple; the  profession of arms was a business like any other, carried on for  gain; a captured foe was valued chiefly for the amount of ransom  that could be obtained for him; petty barons and powerful nobles  alike levied exactions on those who might fall into their hands,  unless previously provided with a safe-conduct. Years later, when  King Richard was made a prisoner on his return from the Holy Land,  it was only because of his great exploits for the recapture of the  Holy Sepulchre that any feeling of reprobation was excited against  his captors. Thus then, although Normandy was at peace with England,  it did not seem an unnatural thing to Harold and his companions  that the noble into whose hands they had fallen should demand a  heavy ransom, or that the Duke of Normandy himself should utilize  the opportunity for his advantage.    On the following morning they heard a large body of horsemen ride  up. A minute later the governor accompanied by a Norman noble  entered. They were followed by a number of men-at-arms, among whom  was a fisherman.    \"Now, fellow,\" the count said to this man, \"which is the Saxon  Harold?\"    \"I am,\" Harold said, advancing a step before his companions. \"I  am Harold, Earl of Wessex. I have with my companions been cast on  your shores. I expect honourable treatment, and am willing to pay  any reasonable ransom should you demand one.\"    \"We will talk of that afterwards,\" the count said roughly; \"for the  present you go with me to my castle at Beaurain. But first do you  and your men hand over all valuables that you may possess; they are  forfeited to me, being cast up on my land.\"    Without a word Harold produced his chain of office and other  ornaments, and dropped them into a helmet which a soldier at the  orders of the count held out for them. His companions did the same,  the thanes first and then the two lads.    \"That will do,\" the count said to the soldiers. \"That is my share,  you can search the rest yourselves.\"    \"I protest against this robbery,\" Harold said haughtily, \"and will  proclaim you in all the courts of Europe as one who is false to his  station, and who condescends to pillage those whom fortune has cast  on his shores.\"    \"You can wait until you get an opportunity to do so,\" the count  sneered; \"it is not likely to come for some time. You can do as you  like to the others,\" he went on to the governor, \"I want not to be  cumbered with them. You can doubtless find work for them on the  fortifications, but if you can put them to no use or they are  troublesome, cut their throats and throw them into the sea.\"    The Saxons fingered their knives, but Harold said in their own  tongue, \"Resistance would be folly, the time may come when we may  turn the tables on this fellow.\" The soldiers now closed round  Harold and the thanes and led them out of the house. Here they were  ordered to mount each behind a soldier, and as soon as they had  done so they rode out from St. Valery, and crossing the river Somme  at Abbeville, and the Authie by a ford near Crecy, reached the  fortress of Beaurain on the river Canche near the town of Hesdin  before nightfall. On the road Wulf watched anxiously for a chance  to escape, but none offered itself. Soldiers rode on both sides of  the captives, and had he slipped from the horse he could not have  hoped to make his escape across an open country. As soon as they  entered the fortress Harold and the thanes were all consigned to  dungeons, but the count, learning that the two lads had been Harold's  pages, said they should wait on himself. \"And see,\" he said to them,  \"that your service is good, if you do not wish to dangle over the  moat at the end of a rope.\"    \"It is a shame that such a man should be a nobleman,\" Beorn exclaimed  indignantly to Wulf, as he saw that the soldiers were placing chains  upon Harold before they led him away.    \"He is a hateful-looking villain,\" Wulf said. \"It is but lately  that he revolted against William. I heard of it from the prior. His  brother, the last Count of Ponthieu, joined France in an invasion  of Normandy. He fell in an ambush at St. Aubin, and this man became  count. For a time he was held prisoner by the duke, but afterwards  he was freed, and received back his dominions as a vassal. His face  is at once cruel and base. I told you the instructions Harold gave  me, Beorn; the need for carrying them out has arrived, and I will  try to make my escape without loss of time from this fortress to  bear the tidings to the duke.\"    \"I will escape with you, Wulf; two can get on better than one.\"    \"That is so, Beorn, and I would gladly have you with me, but maybe  I shall be detected in attempting to escape and be slain, or I may  fall into the hands of peasants and be brought back here, and if  we were together all hope of letting the duke know of our lord's  captivity would be at an end. Therefore it were best that I made  the attempt first. If I fail, which is like enough, then do you in  turn try to get away and bear the news to the duke.\"    Beorn did not like to stay behind, but he saw that Wulf's plan was  best, and accordingly fell in with it.    \"Will you go at once?\" he asked.    \"No; I will stay for a day or two to lull suspicion. They may watch  us just at first, but if they see that we do as we are ordered with  good-will they will cease to regard us so narrowly; moreover, it  will be needful to know the place well before I devise a plan of  escape.\"          CHAPTER V.      ROUEN.    For the next two days the lives of the two young Saxons were well-nigh  unbearable. At meals the count by turns abused and jeered at them,  and his companions, following his example, lost no opportunity of  insulting them in every way.    \"If this goes on, Wulf,\" Beorn said as they threw themselves down  on the ground late that night, when the carousal was ended, \"I shall  snatch the count's dagger from his belt and bury it in his heart,  though they put me to death by torture afterwards.\"    \"I thought of doing so myself, Beorn, to-night, when he threw a cup  of wine over me. But I said to myself my life is not my own, Harold's  rescue depends on it. We are bound as his men to suffer in patience  whatever may befall us. In another hour I shall try to make my  escape. When it was your turn to wait this evening I stole away for  a time, and went to the shed where they keep the war-engines and  took thence a coil of rope, which I have hidden in the courtyard.  You know that we noticed last night where the sentries were placed,  and decided where I might best drop from the wall unobserved.  Fortunately the moat is dry at present, though they can turn water  into it from the stream at will, so that once down I shall have no  difficulty in getting away. Now I want you to go to sleep directly,  I shall not stir until you do so, then when you are questioned in  the morning you can say that I was by your side when you went to  sleep, and that when you woke in the morning the place was vacant.  You can say that I told you during the day that I could not suffer  these insults much longer, and that you suppose that after you had  gone to sleep I must have got up and either killed myself or in  some way made my escape.\"    Beorn lay quiet for a time and then Wulf said suddenly, \"I have  changed my mind, Beorn; we will go together. I feel it is likely  that in his wrath at my escape the count may slay you, and thus the  object with which you remained behind would come to nothing, therefore  it is best that you go with me.\"    \"I was thinking so myself, Wulf, though I would not say it; but in  truth I think the risks we may run in making our way to Rouen are  small compared to those of staying here.\"    \"We must lose no time, Beorn. The castle is quiet now, and we must  be many miles away from here before morning, for you may be sure  the count's horsemen will scour the country far and wide in pursuit  of us.\"    They had that morning, before the count was up and their services  were required, wandered about the fortress, apparently paying no  attention to anything, but really closely observing the approaches  to the walls and the general features of the country outside. They  now stole out, keeping in the shadow of the building, until they  reached the staircase leading up to the battlements, close to the  point Wulf had fixed upon for making their descent. This had been  chosen chiefly because no sentry was placed on that part of the  wall, the watch generally being careless, as Normandy was at present  at peace with its neighbours. When they reached the top of the steps  they listened for a short time, but everything was silent. Then  they stepped out on to the narrow pathway along the battlements,  fastened one end of the rope round a piece of stonework and let the  other end drop down into the fosse.    \"Shall we"]]]
