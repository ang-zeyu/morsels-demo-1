Lo! where on that huge anchor sadly leans  That sick tall figure, lost in other scenes;  He late from India's clime impatient sail'd,  There, as his fortune grew, his spirits fail'd;  For each delight, in search of wealth he went,  For ease alone, the wealth acquired is spent -  And spent in vain; enrich'd, aggrieved, he sees  The envied poor possess'd of joy and ease:  And now he flies from place to place, to gain  Strength for enjoyment, and still flies in vain:  Mark! with what sadness, of that pleasant crew,  Boist'rous in mirth, he takes a transient view;  And fixing then his eye upon the sea,  Thinks what has been and what must shortly be:  Is it not strange that man should health destroy,  For joys that come when he is dead to joy?     Now is it pleasant in the Summer-eve,  When a broad shore retiring waters leave,  Awhile to wait upon the firm fair sand,  When all is calm at sea, all still at land;  And there the ocean's produce to explore,  As floating by, or rolling on the shore:  Those living jellies which the flesh inflame,  Fierce as a nettle, and from that its name;  Some in huge masses, some that you may bring  In the small compass of a lady's ring;  Figured by hand divine--there's not a gem  Wrought by man's art to be compared to them;  Soft, brilliant, tender, through the wave they glow,  And make the moonbeam brighter where they flow.  Involved in sea-wrack, here you find a race  Which science, doubting, knows not where to place;  On shell or stone is dropp'd the embryo-seed,  And quickly vegetates a vital breed.     While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect  Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject,  See as they float along th' entangled weeds  Slowly approach, upborne on bladdery beads;  Wait till they land, and you shall then behold  The fiery sparks those tangled fronds infold,  Myriads of living points; th' unaided eye  Can but the fire and not the form descry.  And now your view upon the ocean turn,  And there the splendour of the waves discern;  Cast but a stone, or strike them with an oar,  And you shall flames within the deep explore;  Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand,  And the cold flames shall flash along your hand;  When, lost in wonder, you shall walk and gaze  On weeds that sparkle, and on waves that blaze.     The ocean too has Winter views serene,  When all you see through densest fog is seen;  When you can hear the fishers near at hand  Distinctly speak, yet see not where they stand;  Or sometimes them and not their boat discern;  Or half-conceal'd some figure at the stern;  The view's all bounded, and from side to side  Your utmost prospect but a few ells wide;  Boys who, on shore, to sea the pebble cast,  Will hear it strike against the viewless mast;  While the stern boatman growls his fierce disdain,  At whom he knows not, whom he threats in vain.     Tis pleasant then to view the nets float past,  Net after net till you have seen the last:  And as you wait till all beyond you slip,  A boat comes gliding from an anchor'd ship,  Breaking the silence with the dipping oar,  And their own tones, as labouring for the shore;  Those measured tones which with the scene agree,  And give a sadness to serenity.     All scenes like these the tender Maid should shun,  Nor to a misty beach in autumn run;  Much should she guard against the evening cold,  And her slight shape with fleecy warmth infold;  This she admits, but not with so much ease  Gives up the night-walk when th' attendants please:  Her have I seen, pale, vapour'd through the day,  With crowded parties at the midnight play;  Faint in the morn, no powers could she exert;  At night with Pam delighted and alert;  In a small shop she's raffled with a crowd,  Breath'd the thick air, and cough'd and laugh'd aloud;  She who will tremble if her eye explore  \"The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor;\"  Whom the kind doctor charged, with shaking head,  At early hour to quit the beaux for bed;  She has, contemning fear, gone down the dance,  Till she perceived the rosy morn advance;  Then has she wonder'd, fainting o'er her tea,  Her drops and julep should so useless be:  Ah! sure her joys must ravish every sense,  Who buys a portion at such vast expense.     Among those joys, 'tis one at eve to sail  On the broad River with a favourite gale;  When no rough waves upon the bosom ride,  But the keel cuts, nor rises on the tide;  Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands,  Where playful children trail their idle hands:  Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float  On either side of the impeded boat;  What time the moon arising shows the mud,  A shining border to the silver flood:  When, by her dubious light, the meanest views,  Chalk, stones, and stakes, obtain the richest hues;  And when the cattle, as they gazing stand,  Seem nobler objects than when view'd from land:  Then anchor'd vessels in the way appear,  And sea-boys greet them as they pass--\"What cheer?\"  The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise,  And utter loud their unharmonious cries;  Fluttering they move their weedy beds among,  Or instant diving, hide their plumeless young.     Along the wall, returning from the town,  The weary rustic homeward wanders down:  Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew,  And feels his envy rising at the view;  He the light speech and laugh indignant hears,  And feels more press'd by want, more vex'd by fears.     Ah! go in peace, good fellow, to thine home,  Nor fancy these escape the general doom:  Gay as they seem, be sure with them are hearts  With sorrow tried; there's sadness in their parts:  If thou couldst see them when they think alone,  Mirth, music, friends, and these amusements gone;  Couldst thou discover every secret ill  That pains their spirit, or resists their will;  Couldst thou behold forsaken Love's distress,  Or Envy's pang at glory and success,  Or Beauty, conscious of the spoils of Time,  Or Guilt alarm'd when Memory shows the crime;  All that gives sorrow, terror, grief, and gloom;  Content would cheer thee trudging to thine home.     There are, 'tis true, who lay their cares aside,  And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide;  Perchance some fair one to the sober night  Adds (by the sweetness of her song) delight;  And as the music on the water floats,  Some bolder shore returns the soften'd notes;  Then, youth, beware, for all around conspire  To banish caution and to wake desire;  The day's amusement, feasting, beauty, wine,  These accents sweet and this soft hour combine,  When most unguarded, then to win that heart of thine:  But see, they land! the fond enchantment flies,  And in its place life's common views arise.     Sometimes a Party, row'd from town will land  On a small islet form'd of shelly sand,  Left by the water when the tides are low,  But which the floods in their return o'erflow:  There will they anchor, pleased awhile to view  The watery waste, a prospect wild and new;  The now receding billows give them space,  On either side the growing shores to pace;  And then returning, they contract the scene,  Till small and smaller grows the walk between;  As sea to sea approaches, shore to shores,  Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores.     Then what alarm! what danger and dismay,  If all their trust, their boat, should drift away;  And once it happen'd--Gay the friends advanced,  They walk'd, they ran, they play'd, they sang, they danced;  The urns were boiling, and the cups went round,  And not a grave or thoughtful face was found;  On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet,  Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat;  The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head,  And waves ran softly up their shining bed.  Some form'd a party from the rest to stray,  Pleased to collect the trifles in their way;  These to behold they call their friends around,  No friends can hear, or hear another sound;  Alarm'd, they hasten, yet perceive not why,  But catch the fear that quickens as they fly.     For lo! a lady sage, who paced the sand  With her fair children, one in either hand,  Intent on home, had turn'd, and saw the boat  Slipp'd from her moorings, and now far afloat;  She gazed, she trembled, and though faint her call,  It seem'd, like thunder, to confound them all.  Their sailor-guides, the boatman and his mate,  Had drank, and slept regardless of their state:  \"Awake!\" they cried aloud; \"Alarm the shore!  Shout all, or never shall we reach it more!\"  Alas! no shout the distant land can reach,  Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach:  Again they join in one loud powerful cry,  Then cease, and eager listen for reply;  None came--the rising wind blew sadly by:  They shout once more, and then they turn aside,  To see how quickly flow'd the coming tide;  Between each cry they find the waters steal  On their strange prison, and new horrors feel;  Foot after foot on the contracted ground  The billows fall, and dreadful is the sound;  Less and yet less the sinking isle became,  And there was wailing, weeping, wrath, and blame.     Had one been there, with spirit strong and high,  Who could observe, as he prepared to die,  He might have seen of hearts the varying kind,  And traced the movement of each different mind:  He might have seen, that not the gentle maid  Was more than stern and haughty man afraid;  Such, calmly grieving, will their fears suppress,  And silent prayers to Mercy's throne address;  While fiercer minds, impatient, angry, loud,  Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd:  The party's patron, sorely sighing, cried,  \"Why would you urge me? I at first denied.\"  Fiercely they answer'd, \"Why will you complain,  Who saw no danger, or was warn'd in vain?\"  A few essay'd the troubled soul to calm,  But dread prevail'd, and anguish and alarm.

He comes to me to get me to give him something to write when his  master don't want to work.  Then there's another tutor, too, no scholar,  but very painstaking, though; he can teach you more than he knows  himself.  He comes to the house on holidays and is always satisfied with  whatever you pay him.  Some little time ago, I bought the kid some law  books; I want him to have a smattering of the law for home use.  There's  bread in that!  As for literature, he's got enough of that in him  already; if he begins to kick, I've concluded that I'll make him learn  some trade; the barber's, say, or the auctioneer's, or even the lawyer's.  That's one thing no one but the devil can do him out of!  'Believe  what  your  daddy  says, Primigenius,' I din into his ears every day, 'whenever  you learn a thing, it's yours.  Look at Phileros the attorney; he'd not  be keeping the wolf from the door now if he hadn't studied.  It's not  long since he had to carry his wares on his back and peddle them, but he  can put up a front with Norbanus himself now!  Learning's a fine thing,  and a trade won't starve.'\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-SEVENTH.    Twaddle of this sort was being bandied about when Trimalchio came in;  mopping his forehead and washing his hands in perfume, he said, after a  short pause, \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but my stomach's been on strike for  the past few days and the doctors disagreed about the cause.  But  pomegranate rind and pitch steeped in vinegar have helped me, and I hope  that my belly will get on its good behavior, for sometimes there's such a  rumbling in my guts that you'd think a bellowing bull was in there.  So  if anyone wants to do his business, there's no call to be bashful about  it.  None of us was born solid!  I don't know of any worse torment than  having to hold it in, it's the one thing Jupiter himself can't hold in.  So you're laughing, are you, Fortunata?  Why, you're always keeping me  awake at night yourself.  I never objected yet to anyone in my  dining-room relieving himself when he wanted to, and the doctors forbid  our holding it in.  Everything's ready outside, if the call's more  serious, water, close-stool, and anything else you'll need. Believe me,  when this rising vapor gets to the brain, it puts the whole body on the  burn.  Many a one I've known to kick in just because he wouldn't own up  to the truth.\"  We thanked him for his kindness and consideration, and  hid our laughter by drinking more and oftener. We had not realized that,  as yet, we were only in the middle of the entertainment, with a hill  still ahead, as the saying goes.  The tables were cleared off to the beat  of music, and three white hogs, muzzled, and wearing bells, were brought  into the dining-room.  The announcer informed us that one was a  two-year-old, another three, and the third just turned six.  I had an  idea that some rope-dancers had come in and that the hogs would perform  tricks, just as they do for the crowd on the streets, but Trimalchio  dispelled this illusion by asking, \"Which one will you have served up  immediately, for dinner?  Any country cook can manage a dunghill cock, a  pentheus hash, or little things like that, but my cooks are well used to  serving up calves boiled whole, in their cauldrons!\" Then he ordered a  cook to be called in at once, and without awaiting our pleasure, he  directed that the oldest be butchered, and demanded in a loud voice,  \"What division do you belong too?\"  When the fellow made answer that he  was from the fortieth, \"Were you bought, or born upon my estates?\"  Trimalchio continued.  \"Neither,\" replied the cook, \"I was left to you by  Pansa's will.\"  \"See to it that this is properly done,\" Trimalchio  warned, \"or I'll have you transferred to the division of messengers!\"  and the cook, bearing his master's warning in mind, departed for the  kitchen with the next course in tow.          CHAPTER THE FORTY-EIGHTH.    Trimalchio's threatening face relaxed and he turned to us, \"If the wine  don't please you,\" he said, \"I'll change it; you ought to do justice to  it by drinking it.  I don't have to buy it, thanks to the gods.  Everything here that makes your mouths water, was produced on one of my  country places which I've never yet seen, but they tell me it's down  Terracina and Tarentum way.  I've got a notion to add Sicily to my other  little holdings, so in case I want to go to Africa, I'll be able to sail  along my own coasts.  But tell me the subject of your speech today,  Agamemnon, for, though I don't plead cases myself, I studied literature  for home use, and for fear you should think I don't care about learning,  let me inform you that I have three libraries, one Greek and the others  Latin.  Give me the outline of your speech if you like me.\"    \"A poor man and a rich man were enemies,\" Agamemmon began, when: \"What's  a poor man?\"  Trimalchio broke in.  \"Well put,\" Agamemnon conceded and  went into details upon some problem or other, what it was I do not know.  Trimalchio instantly rendered the following verdict, \"If that's the case,  there's nothing to dispute about; if it's not the case, it don't amount  to anything anyhow.\"  These flashes of wit, and others equally  scintillating, we loudly applauded, and he went on: \"Tell me, my dearest  Agamemnon, do you remember the twelve labors of Hercules or the story of  Ulysses, how the Cyclops threw his thumb out of joint with a pig-headed  crowbar?  When I was a boy, I used to read those stories in Homer.  And  then, there's the Sibyl: with my own eyes I saw her, at Cumae, hanging up  in a jar; and whenever the boys would say to her 'Sibyl, Sibyl, what  would you?' she would answer, 'I would die.'\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-NINTH.    Before he had run out of wind, a tray upon which was an enormous hog was  placed upon the table, almost filling it up.  We began to wonder at the  dispatch with which it had been prepared and swore that no cock could  have been served up in so short a time; moreover, this hog seemed to us  far bigger than the boar had been. Trimalchio scrutinized it closely and  \"What the hell,\" he suddenly bawled out, \"this hog hain't been gutted,  has it?  No, it hain't, by Hercules, it hain't!  Call that cook!  Call  that cook in here immediately!\"  When the crestfallen cook stood at the  table and owned up that he had forgotten to bowel him, \"So you forgot,  did you?\"  Trimalchio shouted, \"You'd think he'd only left out a bit of  pepper and cummin, wouldn't you? Off with his clothes!\"  The cook was  stripped without delay, and stood with hanging head, between two  torturers.  We all began to make excuses for him at this, saying, \"Little  things like that are bound to happen once in a while, let us prevail upon  you to let him off; if he ever does such a thing again, not a one of us  will have a word to say in his behalf.\"  But for my part, I was  mercilessly angry and could not help leaning over towards Agamemnon and  whispering in his ear, \"It is easily seen that this fellow is criminally  careless, is it not?  How could anyone forget to draw a hog?  If he had  served me a fish in that fashion I wouldn't overlook it, by Hercules, I  wouldn't.\"  But that was not Trimalchio's way: his face relaxed into good  humor and he said, \"Since your memory's so short, you can gut him right  here before our eyes!\" The cook put on his tunic, snatched up a carving  knife, with a trembling hand, and slashed the hog's belly in several  places.  Sausages and meat-puddings, widening the apertures, by their  own weight, immediately tumbled out.          CHAPTER THE FIFTIETH.    The whole household burst into unanimous applause at this; \"Hurrah for  Gaius,\" they shouted.  As for the cook, he was given a drink and a silver  crown and a cup on a salver of Corinthian bronze. Seeing that Agamemnon  was eyeing the platter closely, Trimalchio remarked, \"I'm the only one  that can show the real Corinthian!\" I thought that, in his usual  purse-proud manner, he was going to boast that his bronzes were all  imported from Corinth, but he did even better by saying, \"Wouldn't you  like to know how it is that I'm the only one that can show the real  Corinthian?  Well, it's because the bronze worker I patronize is named  Corinthus, and what's Corinthian unless it's what a Corinthus makes?  And, so you won't think I'm a blockhead, I'm going to show you that I'm  well acquainted with how Corinthian first came into the world.  When Troy  was taken, Hannibal, who was a very foxy fellow and a great rascal into  the bargain, piled all the gold and silver and bronze statues in one pile  and set 'em afire, melting these different metals into one: then the  metal workers took their pick and made bowls and dessert dishes and  statuettes as well.  That's how Corinthian was born; neither one nor the  other, but an amalgam of all.  But I prefer glass, if you don't mind my  saying so; it don't stink, and if it didn't break, I'd rather have it  than gold, but it's cheap and common now.\"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIRST.    \"But there was an artisan, once upon a time, who made a glass vial that  couldn't be broken.  On that account he was admitted to Caesar with his  gift; then he dashed it upon the floor, when Caesar handed it back to  him.  The Emperor was greatly startled, but the artisan picked the vial  up off the pavement, and it was dented, just like a brass bowl would have  been!  He took a little hammer out of his tunic and beat out the dent  without any trouble.  When he had done that, he thought he would soon be  in Jupiter's heaven, and more especially when Caesar said to him, 'Is  there anyone else who knows how to make this malleable glass?  Think  now!'  And when he denied that anyone else knew the secret, Caesar  ordered his head chopped off, because if this should get out, we would  think no more of gold than we would of dirt.\""]]]
