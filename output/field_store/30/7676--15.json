Partha cannot live without Sauri  (Krishna), nor can Sauri live without Partha. Nor is there anything in  the world that is unconquerable by these two, viz., Krishna and Arjuna.  This handsome Bhima also is the foremost of all persons endued with  might. Of great renown, what can he not achieve when with ye two?  Troops, when properly led, always do excellent service. A force without  a leader hath been called inert by the wise. Forces, therefore, should  always be led by experienced commanders. Into places that are low, the  wise always conduct the water. Even fishermen cause the water (of tank)  to run out through holes. (Experienced leaders always lead their forces  noting the loopholes and assailable points of the foe). We shall,  therefore, strive to accomplish our purpose following the leadership of  Govinda conversant with the science of politics, that personage whose  fame hath spread all over the world. For the successful accomplishment  of one's purposes one should ever place Krishna in the van, that  foremost of personages whose strength consists in wisdom and policy and  who possesseth a knowledge of both method and means. For the  accomplishment of one's purpose let, therefore, Arjuna, the son of  Pritha, follow Krishna the foremost of the Yadavas and let Bhima follow  Arjuna. Policy and good fortune and might will (then) bring about  success in a matter requiring valour.'\" Vaisampayana said,--\"Thus  addressed by Yudhishthira, the trio Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima, all  possessed of great energy, set out for Magadha attired in the garb of  Snataka Brahmanas of resplendent bodies, and blessed by the agreeable  speeches of friends and relatives. Possessed of superior energy and of  bodies already like the Sun, the Moon, and the Fire, inflamed with  wrath at the sad lot of their relative kings, those bodies of theirs  became much more blazing. And the people, beholding Krishna and Arjuna,  both of whom had never before been vanquished in battle, with Bhima in  the van, all ready to achieve the same task, regarded Jarasandha as  already slain. For the illustrious pair (Krishna and Arjuna) were  masters that directed every operation (in the universe), as also all  acts relating to the morality, wealth, and pleasure of every being.  Having set out from the country of the Kurus, they passed through  Kuru-jangala and arrived at the charming lake of lotuses. Passing over  the hills of Kalakuta, they then went on crossing the Gandaki, the  Sadanira (Karatoya), and the Sarkaravarta and the other rivers taking  their rise in the same mountains. They then crossed the delightful  Sarayu and saw the country of Eastern Kosala. Passing over that country  they went to Mithila and then crossing the Mala and Charamanwati, the  three heroes crossed the Ganges and the Sone and went on towards the  east. At last those heroes of unfaded glory arrived at Magadha in the  heart of (the country of) Kushamva. Reaching then the hills of Goratha,  they saw the city of Magadha that was always filled with kine and  wealth and water and rendered handsome with the innumerable trees  standing there.      SECTION XXI    \"Vasudeva said,--'behold, O Partha, the great capital of Magadha,  standing in all its beauty. Filled with flocks and herds and its stock  of water never exhausted, and adorned also with fine mansions standing  in excellent array, it is free from every kind of calamity. The five  large hills of Vaihara, Varaha, Vrishava, Rishigiri, and the delightful  Chaitya, all of high peaks and overgrown with tall trees of cool shade  and connected with one another, seem to be jointly protecting the city  of Girivraja. The breasts of the hills are concealed by forests of  delightful and fragrant Lodhras having the ends of their branches  covered with flowers. It was here that the illustrious Gautama of rigid  vows begat on the Sudra woman Ausinari (the daughter of Usinara)  Kakshivat and other celebrated sons. That the race sprung from Gautama  doth yet live under the sway of an ordinary human race (of monarchs) is  only evidence of Gautama's kindness to kings. And, O Arjuna, it was  here that in olden times the mighty monarchs of Anga, and Vanga and  other countries, came to the abode of Gautama, and passed their days in  joy and happiness. Behold, O Partha, those forests of delightful  Pippalas and beautiful Lodhras standing near the side of Gautama's  abode. There dwelt in old days those Nagas, Arvuda and Sakravapin,  those persecutors of all enemies, as also the Naga Swastika and that  other excellent Naga called Manu. Manu himself had ordered the country  of the Magadhas to be never afflicted with drought, and Kaushika and  Manimat also have favoured the country. Owning such a delightful and  impregnable city, Jarasandha is ever bent on seeking the fruition of  his purposes unlike other monarchs. We shall, however, by slaying him  to-day humble his pride.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"Thus saying those brothers of abundant energy,  viz., he of the Vrishni race and the two Pandavas entered the city of  Magadha. They then approached towards the impregnable city of Girivraja  that was full of cheerful and well-fed inhabitants belonging to all the  four orders, and where festivities were perennial. On arriving then at  the gate of the city, the brothers (instead of passing through it)  began to pierce (with their shafts) the heart of the high Chaityaka  peak that was worshipped by the race of Vrihadratha, as also by the  citizens and which delighted the hearts of all the Magadhas. There  Vrihadratha had slain a cannibal called Rishava and having slain the  monster made of his hide three drums which he placed in his own city.  And those drums were such that once beaten their sound lasted one full  month. And the brothers broke down the Chaityaka peak that was  delightful to all the Magadhas, at that point where those drums covered  with celestial flowers used to yield their continuous sound. And  desirous of slaying Jarasandha they seemed by that act of theirs to  place their feet upon the head of their foe. And attacking with their  mighty arms that immovable and huge and high and old and celebrated  peak always worshipped with perfumes and floral wreaths, those heroes  broke it down. And with joyful hearts they then entered the city. And  it so happened that the learned Brahmanas residing within the city saw  many evil omens which they reported to Jarasandha. And the priest  making the king mount an elephant whirled lighted brands about him. And  king Jarasandha also, possessed of great prowess, with a view to  warding of those evils, entered upon the celebration of a sacrifice,  with proper vows and fasts. Meanwhile, O Bharata, the brothers unarmed,  or rather with their bare arms as their only weapons, desirous of  fighting with Jarasandha, entered the capital in the guise of  Brahmanas. They beheld the extraordinary beauty of the shops full of  various edibles and floral wreaths, and supplied with articles of every  variety of various qualities that man can desire. Those best of men,  Krishna, Bhima, and Dhananjaya, beholding in those shops their  affluence, passed along the public road. And endued with great strength  they snatched forcibly from the flower-vendors the garlands they had  exposed for sale. And attired in robes of various colours and decked in  garlands and ear-rings the heroes entered the abode of Jarasandha  possessed of great intelligence, like Himalayan lions eyeing  cattle-folds. And the arms of those warriors, O king, besmeared with  sandal paste, looked like the trunks of sala trees. The people of  Magadha, beholding those heroes looking like elephants, with necks  broad like those of trees and wide chests, began to wonder much. Those  bull among men, passing through three gates that were crowded with men,  proudly and cheerfully approached the king. And Jarasandha rising up in  haste received them with water to wash their feet with, and honey and  the other ingredients of the Arghya--with gifts of kine, and with other  forms of respect. The great king addressing them said,--'Ye are  welcome'! And, O Janamejaya, both Partha and Bhima remained silent at  this. And addressing the monarch Krishna said,--'O king of kings these  two are now in the observance of a vow. Therefore they will not speak.  Silent they will remain till midnight. After that hour they will speak  with thee!' The king then quartering his guests in the sacrificial  apartments retired into his private chambers. And when midnight  arrived, the monarch arrived at the place where his guests attired as  Brahmanas were. For, O King, that ever victorious monarch observed this  vow which was known throughout the Worlds that as soon as he should  hear of the arrival of Snataka Brahmanas at his place, should it be  even at midnight, he would immediately, O Bharata, come out and grant  them an audience. Beholding the strange attire of his guests that best  of kings wondered much. For all that, however, he waited on them  respectfully. Those bulls among men, those slayers of all foes, on the  other hand, O thou best of the Bharata race, beholding king Jarasandha,  said,--'Let salvation be attained by thee, O king, without difficulty.'  And, O tiger among kings, having said this unto the monarch, they stood  looking at each other. And, O king of kings, Jarasandha then said unto  those sons of Pandu and him of the Yadu race, all disguised as  Brahmanas--'Take your seats.' And those bulls among men sat themselves  down, and like the three priests of a great sacrifice blazed forth in  their beauty. And king Jarasandha, O thou of the Kuru race, firmly  devoted to truth, censuring the disguised guests, said unto them,--'It  is well known to me that in the whole world Brahmanas in the observance  of Snataka vow never deck their persons with garlands"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#14)"],[1,"among  the other nations, although they continued to preserve their nationality.  They had some settlements, at a later period, in Oneida Castle, called by  them Gaunea-wahro-hare (signifying head on the pole), and one in the  valley of the Genesee below Avon, called by them Ju-na-stre-yo  (signifying the beautiful valley); another settlement at Con-na-so-ra-ga,  on the line between Onondaga and Oneida; another in the fork of  Chattenango Creek, which they called Ju-ta-nea-ga (signifying where the  sun shines); and another on the Jordan Creek, which they called Kan-ha-to  (signifying limb in water). These several places were settled at  different periods, which I am not able to give.    In the revolutionary war between the United States and Great Britain, the  Tuscaroras then had their settlement at the place alotted them by the  league in 1715, between the Unadilla river and the Chenango. They took an  active part with the United States. Many a soldier and scout of the  United States, in their fatigue and hunger, found a rest and a morsel in  the rude homes of the Tuscaroras, which were ever hospitably open to  them.    When the other Indians which took part with the British knew that the  Tuscaroras took part with the United States, they invaded their  settlement, destroyed their property and burned down their houses to  ashes, which scattered them for a while. There was a party that settled  at Oyouwayea, or Johnson's landing place, on lake Ontario, about four  miles east of the mouth of Niagara River, which is at the mouth of the  four-mile creek, for the purpose of getting out of the centre of the  other Indians which were for the British.    About the close of the war there were two families of the Tuscaroras  hunting and fishing along the shores of lake Ontario, and then up the  east shore of Niagara River as far as Lewiston, and there left their  canoe; then traveled east and up the mountain as far as a place which  they now call the Old Saw Mill (now on the Tuscarora Reservation), above  the Ayers' farm, where they saw great quantities of butternuts and  walnuts and and a nice stream of water flowing down the mountain; there  they took their rest, and after remaining several days they concluded to  make their winter quarters at that place, which they did. After they were  missing for a time from the settlement at Johnson's landing, they were  hunted by their people and finally found at this place. A few years after  this the Oneidas and Tuscaroras ceded the tract of land that was  apportioned to the Tuscaroras; then families after families came and  located with those two families mentioned above. This is the beginning of  the settlement of the present Tuscarora Reservation.    The Tuscaroras, ever since the revolutionary war, have had their  residence within the territory of the Seneca nation, they being  considered the father of the Tuscarora by being adopted as such, at the  time of their initiation into the confederacy, in the year 1715.    I will here give the boundary of the Seneca Nation domain, according to  the treaty entitled \"A Treaty between the United States of America and  the Tribes of Indians called the Six Nations\":    \"The President of the United States having determined to hold a  conference with the Six Nations of Indians, for the purpose of removing  from their minds all causes of complaint, and establishing a firm and  permanent friendship with them, and Timothy Pickering being appointed  sole agent for that purpose, and the agent having met and conferred with  the sachems, chiefs and warriors of the Six Nations, in a general  council, now, in order to accomplish the good design of the conference,  the parties have agreed on the following articles, when ratified by the  President, with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United  States, shall be binding on them and the Six Nations.    \"Article 1. Peace and friendship are hereby firmly established, and shall  be perpetual between the United States and the Six Nations.    \"Article 2. The United States acknowledge the lands reserved to the  Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga Nations, in their respective treaties with  the State of New York, and called their reservations, to be their  property; and the United States will never claim the same, nor disturb  them or either of the Six Nations, nor their Indian friends residing  thereon and united with them, in the free use and enjoyment thereof; but  the said reservations shall remain theirs until they choose to sell the  same to the people of the United States, who have the right to purchase.    \"Article 3. The land of the Seneca Nation is bounded as follows:  Beginning on Lake Ontario at the northwest corner of the land they sold  to Oliver Phelps, the line runs westerly along the lake as far as O-yong-  wong-yeh creek, at Johnson's landing place, about four miles eastward  from the fort of Niagara; then southerly up that creek to its main fork;  then straight to the main fork of Stedman's creek, which empties into the  Niagara river above fort Schlosser; and then onward from that fort,  continuing the same straight course, to the river (this line from the  mouth of O-yong-wong-yeh creek to the river Niagara above Fort Schlosser,  being the eastern boundary of a strip of land extending from the same  line to Niagara river, which the Seneca Nation ceded to the king of Great  Britain at a treaty held about thirty years ago, with Sir William  Johnson); then the line runs along the river Niagara to Lake Erie; then  along Lake Erie to the eastern corner of a triangle piece of land which  the United States ceded to the state of Pennsylvania, as by the  President's patent, dated the third day of March 1792; then due south to  the boundary of that state; then due east to the southwest corner of the  land sold by the Seneca Nation to Oliver Phelps; and then northerly along  Phelps' line to the place of beginning, on Lake Ontario. Now, the United  States acknowledge all the land within the aforementioned boundary to be  the property of the Seneca Nation; and the United States will never claim  the same, nor disturb the Seneca Nation, nor their Indian friends  residing thereon and united with them, in the free use and enjoyment  thereof; but it shall remain theirs until they choose to sell the same to  the people of the United States, who have the right to purchase.    \"Article 4. The United States having thus described and acknowledged what  lands belong to the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas, and engaged  never to claim the same, nor disturb them or any of the Six Nations, nor  their Indian friends residing thereon and united with them, in the free  use and enjoyment thereof, etc. Proclaimed January 21, 1785.\"    You will observe in the treaty above that the name of the Tuscarora  Nation is not mentioned at all, and yet speaks of the Six Nations, which  includes the Tuscarora Nation. The reason is this: In Article 2 you will  observe that all the nations that have their lands on the east side of  what is known as the Phelps line were named, and west of that line was  the land of the Seneca Nation on which the Tuscaroras resided, and were  considered as being merged into the Seneca Nation, and have the benefit  of the laws enacted for them.    There was also a contract entered into between the Seneca Nation of  Indians of the first part, and Robert Morris. Esq., of the city of  Philadelphia, of the second part. At a treaty held under the authority of  the United States, at Genesee, in the county of Ontario, State of New  York, on the fifteenth day of September, 1797, and on sundry days  immediately prior thereto, by the Honorable Jeremiah Wadsworth. Esq., a  commissioner appointed by the President of the United States to hold the  same, when the Senecas ceded the country that included the now Tuscarora  Reservation. The Tuscaroras then and there made their complaint by their  chiefs, for the first since they were initiated into the confederacy of  the Iroquois; in the presence of the commissioner and the others that are  parties to the treaty; that the Iroquois had from time to time allotted  them lands and had been ceded each time by the Iroquois, without giving  them a farthing to remunerate them for their portion of the lands so  ceded, or for the improvements that they had made, and asked if they were  to be driven in this manner from place to place all the days of their  existence, and if that is the way a father should use their children or  brothers should use their brothers, and to keep them living in  disappointment; they also alluded to a treaty concluded at Fort Stanwix  three years before this, where the commissioners of the United States  reserved to them land, which read as follows:    \"Article 2. The Oneida and Tuscarora Nations shall be secured in the  possession of the lands on which they are settled.\"    The commissioner then inquired into the merits of the complaint of the  Tuscaroras, which the Iroquois affirmed; the commissioner then said to  them, that it is not right to make a contract, or to grant anything  without faith; it is only honorable when you adhere to your stipulation.    When Robert Morris knew that the Tuscaroras were destitute of land, he  reserved and donated to them two square miles being 1280 acres; the  Senecas also granted to them one square mile being 640 acres, which grant  was made at the convention dated above. On the 13th day of March, 1808,  the sachems, chiefs and head men of the Seneca Nation of Indians executed  a written indenture of the grant or deed to the Tuscarora Nation, of the  one square mile of land above mentioned, and was duly signed by the  sachems, chiefs and head men of the aforesaid Indians. On the 22d day of  September, 1810, it was entered and put on file in the Niagara County  Clerk's office, on page 56; and was again put on file in the Niagara  County Clerk's Office, Lockport, in book of deeds 151, page 168,"]]]
