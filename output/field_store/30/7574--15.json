I  cannot take you to-night because they are away. They went to the store  at Radnor. But I will take you to-morrow night; and after that I shall  not see you any more.\"    Two great tears brimmed over in her big blue eyes and splashed down  on her slate. Her lips quivered like a hurt child's. Eric put his arm  impulsively about her and drew her head down upon his shoulder. As she  cried there, softly, miserably, he pressed his lips to the silky black  hair with its coronal of rosebuds. He did not see two burning eyes which  were looking at him over the old fence behind him with hatred and mad  passion blazing in their depths. Neil Gordon was crouched there, with  clenched hands and heaving breast, watching them.    \"Kilmeny, dear, don't cry,\" said Eric tenderly. \"You shall see me again.  I promise you that, whatever happens. I do not think your uncle and aunt  will be as unreasonable as you fear, but even if they are they shall not  prevent me from meeting you somehow.\"    Kilmeny lifted her head, and wiped the tears from her eyes.    \"You do not know what they are like,\" she wrote. \"They will lock me into  my room. That is the way they always punished me when I was a little  girl. And once, not so very long ago, when I was a big girl, they did  it.\"    \"If they do I'll get you out somehow,\" said Eric, laughing a little.    She allowed herself to smile, but it was a rather forlorn little effort.  She did not cry any more, but her spirits did not come back to her. Eric  talked gaily, but she only listened in a pensive, absent way, as if she  scarcely heard him. When he asked her to play she shook her head.    \"I cannot think any music to-night,\" she wrote, \"I must go home, for my  head aches and I feel very stupid.\"    \"Very well, Kilmeny. Now, don't worry, little girl. It will all come out  all right.\"    Evidently she did not share his confidence, for her head drooped again  as they walked together across the orchard. At the entrance of the wild  cherry lane she paused and looked at him half reproachfully, her eyes  filling again. She seemed to be bidding him a mute farewell. With an  impulse of tenderness which he could not control, Eric put his arm about  her and kissed her red, trembling mouth. She started back with a little  cry. A burning colour swept over her face, and the next moment she fled  swiftly up the darkening lane.    The sweetness of that involuntary kiss clung to Eric's lips as he went  homeward, half-intoxicating him. He knew that it had opened the gates of  womanhood to Kilmeny. Never again, he felt, would her eyes meet his with  their old unclouded frankness. When next he looked into them he knew  that he should see there the consciousness of his kiss. Behind her in  the orchard that night Kilmeny had left her childhood.        CHAPTER XII. A PRISONER OF LOVE    When Eric betook himself to the orchard the next evening he had to  admit that he felt rather nervous. He did not know how the Gordons would  receive him and certainly the reports he had heard of them were not  encouraging, to say the least of it. Even Mrs. Williamson, when he had  told her where he was going, seemed to look upon him as one bent on  bearding a lion in his den.    \"I do hope they won't be very uncivil to you, Master,\" was the best she  could say.    He expected Kilmeny to be in the orchard before him, for he had been  delayed by a call from one of the trustees; but she was nowhere to be  seen. He walked across it to the wild cherry lane; but at its entrance  he stopped short in sudden dismay.    Neil Gordon had stepped from behind the trees and stood confronting him,  with blazing eyes, and lips which writhed in emotion so great that at  first it prevented him from speaking.    With a thrill of dismay Eric instantly understood what must have taken  place. Neil had discovered that he and Kilmeny had been meeting in the  orchard, and beyond doubt had carried that tale to Janet and Thomas  Gordon. He realized how unfortunate it was that this should have  happened before he had had time to make his own explanation. It would  probably prejudice Kilmeny's guardians still further against him. At  this point in his thoughts Neil's pent up passion suddenly found vent in  a burst of wild words.    \"So you've come to meet her again. But she isn't here--you'll never see  her again! I hate you--I hate you--I hate you!\"    His voice rose to a shrill scream. He took a furious step nearer Eric  as if he would attack him. Eric looked steadily in his eyes with a calm  defiance, before which his wild passion broke like foam on a rock.    \"So you have been making trouble for Kilmeny, Neil, have you?\" said Eric  contemptuously. \"I suppose you have been playing the spy. And I suppose  that you have told her uncle and aunt that she has been meeting me here.  Well, you have saved me the trouble of doing it, that is all. I was  going to tell them myself, tonight. I don't know what your motive in  doing this has been. Was it jealousy of me? Or have you done it out of  malice to Kilmeny?\"    His contempt cowed Neil more effectually than any display of anger could  have done.    \"Never you mind why I did it,\" he muttered sullenly. \"What I did or  why I did it is no business of yours. And you have no business to come  sneaking around here either. Kilmeny won't meet you here again.\"    \"She will meet me in her own home then,\" said Eric sternly. \"Neil, in  behaving as you have done you have shown yourself to be a very foolish,  undisciplined boy. I am going straightway to Kilmeny's uncle and aunt to  explain everything.\"    Neil sprang forward in his path.    \"No--no--go away,\" he implored wildly. \"Oh, sir--oh, Mr. Marshall,  please go away. I'll do anything for you if you will. I love Kilmeny.  I've loved her all my life. I'd give my life for her. I can't have you  coming here to steal her from me. If you do--I'll kill you! I wanted to  kill you last night when I saw you kiss her. Oh, yes, I saw you. I was  watching--spying, if you like. I don't care what you call it. I had  followed her--I suspected something. She was so different--so changed.  She never would wear the flowers I picked for her any more. She seemed  to forget I was there. I knew something had come between us. And it was  you, curse you! Oh, I'll make you sorry for it.\"    He was working himself up into a fury again--the untamed fury of the  Italian peasant thwarted in his heart's desire. It overrode all the  restraint of his training and environment. Eric, amid all his anger and  annoyance, felt a thrill of pity for him. Neil Gordon was only a boy  still; and he was miserable and beside himself.    \"Neil, listen to me,\" he said quietly. \"You are talking very foolishly.  It is not for you to say who shall or shall not be Kilmeny's friend.  Now, you may just as well control yourself and go home like a decent  fellow. I am not at all frightened by your threats, and I shall know how  to deal with you if you persist in interfering with me or persecuting  Kilmeny. I am not the sort of person to put up with that, my lad.\"    The restrained power in his tone and look cowed Neil. The latter turned  sullenly away, with another muttered curse, and plunged into the shadow  of the firs.    Eric, not a little ruffled under all his external composure by this  most unexpected and unpleasant encounter, pursued his way along the lane  which wound on by the belt of woodland in twist and curve to the Gordon  homestead. His heart beat as he thought of Kilmeny. What might she not  be suffering? Doubtless Neil had given a very exaggerated and distorted  account of what he had seen, and probably her dour relations were very  angry with her, poor child. Anxious to avert their wrath as soon as  might be, he hurried on, almost forgetting his meeting with Neil. The  threats of the latter did not trouble him at all. He thought the angry  outburst of a jealous boy mattered but little. What did matter was that  Kilmeny was in trouble which his heedlessness had brought upon her.    Presently he found himself before the Gordon house. It was an old  building with sharp eaves and dormer windows, its shingles stained a  dark gray by long exposure to wind and weather. Faded green shutters  hung on the windows of the lower story. Behind it grew a thick wood  of spruces. The little yard in front of it was grassy and prim and  flowerless; but over the low front door a luxuriant early-flowering  rose vine clambered, in a riot of blood-red blossom which contrasted  strangely with the general bareness of its surroundings. It seemed to  fling itself over the grim old house as if intent on bombarding it with  an alien life and joyousness.    Eric knocked at the door, wondering if it might be possible that Kilmeny  should come to it. But a moment later it was opened by an elderly  woman--a woman of rigid lines from the hem of her lank, dark print dress  to the crown of her head, covered with black hair which, despite its few  gray threads, was still thick and luxuriant. She had a long, pale face  somewhat worn and wrinkled, but possessing a certain harsh comeliness  of feature which neither age nor wrinkles had quite destroyed; and  her deep-set, light gray eyes were not devoid of suggested kindliness,  although they now surveyed Eric with an unconcealed hostility. Her  figure, in its merciless dress, was very angular; yet there was about  her a dignity of carriage and manner which Eric liked. In any case, he  preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity.    He lifted his hat.    \"Have I the honour of speaking to Miss Gordon?\" he asked.    \"I am Janet Gordon,\" said the woman stiffly.    \"Then I wish to talk with you and your brother.\"    \"Come in.\"    She stepped aside and motioned him to a low brown door opening on the  right.    \"Go in and sit "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#14)"],[1,"on the floor.    \"Has he told you of his last escapade--his last mad freak?\" he said, in  a low voice.    \"Yes,\" she answered, calmly. \"He has never concealed anything from me.\"    \"It is nearly twenty thousand pounds. Even Wyndward must feel such  strains as this.\"    The countess raised her head.    \"I know,\" she said; \"he has told me everything. It was a point of  honor. I did not quite understand; horse-racing is a pastime with which  I have little sympathy, though we have always owned race-horses. It was  a point of honor. Some one had been taking advantage of his name to act  dishonestly, and he withdrew the horse. He could take no other course,\"  he says.    The earl sighed.    \"No doubt. But it is mad folly, and there is no end to it--if he could  see some limit! Why does he not marry?\"    The countess glanced at the handsome face.    \"He will not marry until he meets with some one he can love.\"    The earl looked round the room at the many beautiful graceful women who  adorned it, and sighed impatiently.    \"He is hard to please.\"    \"He is,\" assented the countess, with the same touch of pride.    \"It is time he married and settled,\" continued the earl. \"For most men  a year or two would not matter, but with him--I do not like to think  that the title rests only on our two lives, as mine must be near its  close.\"    \"Algernon!\"    \"And on his, which is risked daily.\"    He stooped, silenced by the sudden look of pain in the beautiful eyes.    \"Why do you not speak to him? He will do anything for you.\"    The countess smiled.    \"Everything but that. No, I cannot speak to him; it would be useless. I  do not wish to weaken my influence.\"    \"Get Lilian to speak to him,\" he said.    The countess sighed.    \"Lilian!\" she murmured; \"she would not do it. She thinks him something  more than human, and that no woman in the world can be good enough  to--to hold his stirrup or fill his wineglass.\"    The earl frowned.    \"Between you,\" he said, \"you have spoiled him.\"    The countess shook her head gently.    \"No, we have not. He is now as a man what he was as a boy. Do you  remember what Nelson said, when Hardy asked him why he did nothing  while one of their ships was fighting two of the enemy's? 'I am doing  all I can--watching.'\"    Before the earl could reply, a cabinet minister came up and engaged him  in conversation, and the countess rose and crossed the room to where an  elderly lady sat with a portfolio of engravings before her. It was the  Dowager Countess of Longford, a tiny little woman with a thin wrinkled  face, and keen but kindly gray eyes that lit up her white face and made  it remarkable.    She was dressed as simply as a quakeress, excepting for some old and  priceless lace which softened the rigor of her plainly made gray satin  dress. She looked up as the younger countess approached, and made room  for her on the sofa.    Lady Wyndward sat down in silence, which was unbroken for a minute.  Then the old countess said without looking at her--    \"The boy grows handsomer every day, Ethel!\"    Lady Wyndward sighed.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the other, with a keen smile. \"What has he  been doing now, burning a church or running off with a Lord Mayor's  daughter?\"    \"He has not been doing anything very much,\" answered Lady Wyndward.  \"Except losing some money.\"    The old countess raised her eyebrows lightly.    \"That does not matter.\"    \"Not much. No, he has not been doing anything; I wish he would. That's  what is the matter.\"    \"I understand,\" retorted the other. \"He is most dangerous when quiet;  you are always afraid he is preparing for some piece of madness beyond  the ordinary. Well, my dear, if you will give the world such a  creature you must put up with the consequences--be prepared to pay the  penalty. I should be quite content to do so.\"    \"Ah, you don't know,\" said the countess, with a smile that had  something pathetic in it.    \"Yes, I do,\" retorted the old lady, curtly. \"And I envy you still. I  love the boy, Ethel. There is not a woman of us in the room, from the  youngest to the oldest, who does not love him. You cannot expect one  whom the gods have so favored to behave like an ordinary mortal.\"    \"Why not? It is just what Algernon has said to me.\"    \"I thought as much. I was watching you two. Of all things, beware of  this: don't let Algernon interfere with him. It is a strange thing to  say, but his father is the worst man in all the world to attempt to put  the bridle on Leycester. It is we women who alone have the power to  guide him.\"    \"That is where my fear lies,\" said the countess. \"It is the thought of  what may happen in that quarter which fills me with daily dread.\"    \"There is only one safeguard--marry him,\" remarked the old countess,  but with a comical smile.    The countess sighed.    \"Again, that is what Algernon says. You both say it as calmly as if you  told me to give him a cup of tea.\"    The old countess was silent for a moment, then she said--    \"Where is Lenore Beauchamp?\"    Lady Wyndward was almost guilty of a start.    \"You read my thoughts,\" she said.    The old lady nodded.    \"She is the only woman who can really touch him. Ask her here; let them  be together. She will be glad to come.\"    \"I am not sure, Lenore is proud; she might guess why we wanted her.\"    The old lady drew up her head as haughtily as if she was Leycester's  mother.    \"And then? Is there any girl among them who would not jump at the  chance? I don't mean because he is the heir to Wyndward; he is enough  in himself without that.\"    \"It is well you are not his mother; you would have made him what he is  not now--vain.\"    The old lady sighed.    \"I know it. But you are wrong about Lenore. If she ever cared for  anyone, it is Leycester. She is proud, but love levels pride, and  she may put forth her power. If she should, not even Leycester can  withstand her. Ask her down, and leave the rest to her--and Providence.\"    The countess sat for a moment in silence, then she put her hand upon  the thin, wrinkled hand, unadorned by a single gem.    \"I have always you to come to. I think you understand him better than  his own mother.\"    \"No,\" said the old lady, \"but I love him nearly as well.\"    \"I will write at once,\" said the countess. And she rose and crossed to  the ante-room.    There was a writing-table amongst the furniture; the servants saw her  go to it, and noiselessly left the room.    She took up the pen and thought a moment, then wrote:     \"MY DEAR LENORE,--Will you come down and spend a week with us? We have   a few friends with us, but we are not complete without you. Do not say   'No,' but come. I do not name any day, so that you may be free to fix   your own.\"         \"Yours affectionately,              \"ETHEL WYNDWARD.\"     \"P.S.--Leycester is with us.\"    As she wrote the signature she heard a step behind her, which she knew  was Leycester's.    He stopped short as he saw her, and coming up to her, put his hand on  her white shoulder.    \"Writing, mother?\" he said.    The countess folded her letter.    \"Yes. Where are you going?\"    He pointed to the Louis Quatorze clock that ticked solemnly on a  bracket.    \"Ten o'clock, mother,\" he said, with a smile.    \"Oh, yes; I see,\" she assented.    He stood for a moment looking down at her with all a young man's filial  pride in a mother's beauty, and, bending down, touched her cheek with  his lips, then passed out.    The countess looked after him with softened eyes.    \"Who could help loving him?\" she murmured.    Humming an air from the last opera bouffe, he ran lightly up the  staircase and passed along the corridor, but as he reached the further  end and knocked at a door, the light air died upon his lips.    A low voice murmured, \"Come in;\" and opening the door gently, he  entered.    The room was a small one, and luxuriously furnished in a rather strange  style. On the first entrance, a stranger would have been struck by  the soft and delicate tints which pervaded throughout. There was not  a brilliant color in the apartment; the carpet and hangings, the  furniture, the pictures themselves were all of a reposeful tint, which  could not tire the eye or weary the sense. The carpet was a thick  Persian rug, which deadened the sound of footsteps, costly hangings of  a cool and restful gray covered the walls, save at intervals; the fire  itself was screened by a semi-transparent screen, and the only light in  the room came from a lamp which was suspended by a silver chain from  the ceiling, and was covered by a thick shade.    On a couch placed by the window reclined a young girl. As Leycester  entered, she half rose and turned a pale, but beautiful face toward him  with an expectant smile.    Beautiful is a word that is easily written, and written so often that  its significance has got dulled: it fails to convey any idea of the  ethereal loveliness of Lilian Wyndward. Had Mr. Etheridge painted a  face with Leycester's eyes, and given it the delicately-cut lips and  spiritual expression of one of Raphael's angels, it would have been a  fair representation of Lilian Wyndward.    \"It is you Leycester,\" she said. \"I knew you would come,\" and she  pointed to a small traveling clock that stood on a table near her.    He went up to her and kissed her, and she put her arms round his neck  and laid her face against his, her eyes looking into his with rapt  devotion.    \"How hot you are, dear. Is it hot down there?\"    \"Awfully,\" he said, seating himself beside her, and thrusting his  hands into his pockets. \"There is not a breath of air moving, and if  there were the governor would take care to shut it out. This room is  deliriously cool, Lil; it is a treat to come into it.\"    \"Is it?\" she said, with a glad eagerness. \"You really think it is. I  like to hear you say that.\"    \"Yes, it's the prettiest room in the house. What is it smells so sweet?\"    \"Lilac,\" she said, and she pointed to a bunch on the"]]]
