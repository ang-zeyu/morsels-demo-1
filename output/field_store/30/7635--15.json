She raised her eyes  toward me with astonishment, and her face turned purple, as if she were  seized with a sudden fear. She began to excuse herself, saying that  she did not play well enough. This refusal only excited me the more. I  remember the strange feeling with which I looked at his neck, his white  neck, in contrast with his black hair, separated by a parting, when,  with his skipping gait, like that of a bird, he left my house. I  could not help confessing to myself that this man's presence caused me  suffering. 'It is in my power,' thought I, 'to so arrange things that I  shall never see him again. But can it be that I, _I_, fear him? No, I do  not fear him. It would be too humiliating!'    \"And there in the hall, knowing that my wife heard me, I insisted that  he should come that very evening with his violin. He promised me, and  went away. In the evening he arrived with his violin, and they played  together. But for a long time things did not go well; we had not the  necessary music, and that which we had my wife could not play at sight.  I amused myself with their difficulties. I aided them, I made proposals,  and they finally executed a few pieces,--songs without words, and a  little sonata by Mozart. He played in a marvellous manner. He had what  is called the energetic and tender tone. As for difficulties, there were  none for him. Scarcely had he begun to play, when his face changed. He  became serious, and much more sympathetic. He was, it is needless to  say, much stronger than my wife. He helped her, he advised her simply  and naturally, and at the same time played his game with courtesy.  My wife seemed interested only in the music. She was very simple and  agreeable. Throughout the evening I feigned, not only for the others,  but for myself, an interest solely in the music. Really, I was  continually tortured by jealousy. From the first minute that the  musician's eyes met those of my wife, I saw that he did not regard her  as a disagreeable woman, with whom on occasion it would be unpleasant to  enter into intimate relations.    \"If I had been pure, I should not have dreamed of what he might think of  her. But I looked at women, and that is why I understood him and was in  torture. I was in torture, especially because I was sure that toward  me she had no other feeling than of perpetual irritation, sometimes  interrupted by the customary sensuality, and that this man,--thanks to  his external elegance and his novelty, and, above all, thanks to his  unquestionably remarkable talent, thanks to the attraction exercised  under the influence of music, thanks to the impression that music  produces upon nervous natures,--this man would not only please, but  would inevitably, and without difficulty, subjugate and conquer her, and  do with her as he liked.    \"I could not help seeing this. I could not help suffering, or keep from  being jealous. And I was jealous, and I suffered, and in spite of that,  and perhaps even because of that, an unknown force, in spite of my will,  impelled me to be not only polite, but more than polite, amiable. I  cannot say whether I did it for my wife, or to show him that I did not  fear HIM, or to deceive myself; but from my first relations with him I  could not be at my ease. I was obliged, that I might not give way to a  desire to kill him immediately, to 'caress' him. I filled his glass at  the table, I grew enthusiastic over his playing, I talked to him with  an extremely amiable smile, and I invited him to dinner the following  Sunday, and to play again. I told him that I would invite some of my  acquaintances, lovers of his art, to hear him.    \"Two or three days later I was entering my house, in conversation with  a friend, when in the hall I suddenly felt something as heavy as a stone  weighing on my heart, and I could not account for it. And it was this,  it was this: in passing through the hall, I had noticed something which  reminded me of HIM. Not until I reached my study did I realize what it  was, and I returned to the hall to verify my conjecture. Yes, I was  not mistaken. It was his overcoat (everything that belonged to him,  I, without realizing it, had observed with extraordinary attention). I  questioned the servant. That was it. He had come.    \"I passed near the parlor, through my children's study-room. Lise, my  daughter, was sitting before a book, and the old nurse, with my youngest  child, was beside the table, turning the cover of something or other.  In the parlor I heard a slow arpeggio, and his voice, deadened, and a  denial from her. She said: 'No, no! There is something else!' And it  seemed to me that some one was purposely deadening the words by the aid  of the piano.    \"My God! How my heart leaped! What were my imaginations! When I remember  the beast that lived in me at that moment, I am seized with fright. My  heart was first compressed, then stopped, and then began to beat like  a hammer. The principal feeling, as in every bad feeling, was pity for  myself. 'Before the children, before the old nurse,' thought I, 'she  dishonors me. I will go away. I can endure it no longer. God knows what  I should do if. . . . But I must go in.'    \"The old nurse raised her eyes to mine, as if she understood, and advised  me to keep a sharp watch. 'I must go in,' I said to myself, and, without  knowing what I did, I opened the door. He was sitting at the piano and  making arpeggios with his long, white, curved fingers. She was standing  in the angle of the grand piano, before the open score. She saw or  heard me first, and raised her eyes to mine. Was she stunned, was she  pretending not to be frightened, or was she really not frightened at  all? In any case, she did not tremble, she did not stir. She blushed,  but only a little later.    \"'How glad I am that you have come! We have not decided what we will  play Sunday,' said she, in a tone that she would not have had if she had  been alone with me.    \"This tone, and the way in which she said 'we' in speaking of herself  and of him, revolted me. I saluted him silently. He shook hands with me  directly, with a smile that seemed to me full of mockery. He explained  to me that he had brought some scores, in order to prepare for the  Sunday concert, and that they were not in accord as to the piece  to choose,--whether difficult, classic things, notably a sonata by  Beethoven, or lighter pieces.    \"And as he spoke, he looked at me. It was all so natural, so simple, that  there was absolutely nothing to be said against it. And at the same time  I saw, I was sure, that it was false, that they were in a conspiracy to  deceive me.    \"One of the most torturing situations for the jealous (and in our social  life everybody is jealous) are those social conditions which allow  a very great and dangerous intimacy between a man and a woman under  certain pretexts. One must make himself the laughing stock of everybody,  if he desires to prevent associations in the ball-room, the intimacy  of doctors with their patients, the familiarity of art occupations, and  especially of music. In order that people may occupy themselves together  with the noblest art, music, a certain intimacy is necessary, in which  there is nothing blameworthy. Only a jealous fool of a husband can have  anything to say against it. A husband should not have such thoughts,  and especially should not thrust his nose into these affairs, or prevent  them. And yet, everybody knows that precisely in these occupations,  especially in music, many adulteries originate in our society.    \"I had evidently embarrassed them, because for some time I was unable  to say anything. I was like a bottle suddenly turned upside down, from  which the water does not run because it is too full. I wanted to insult  the man, and to drive him away, but I could do nothing of the kind.  On the contrary, I felt that I was disturbing them, and that it was my  fault. I made a presence of approving everything, this time also, thanks  to that strange feeling that forced me to treat him the more amiably in  proportion as his presence was more painful to me. I said that I trusted  to his taste, and I advised my wife to do the same. He remained just as  long as it was necessary in order to efface the unpleasant impression of  my abrupt entrance with a frightened face. He went away with an air of  satisfaction at the conclusions arrived at. As for me, I was perfectly  sure that, in comparison with that which preoccupied them, the question  of music was indifferent to them. I accompanied him with especial  courtesy to the hall (how can one help accompanying a man who has  come to disturb your tranquillity and ruin the happiness of the entire  family?), and I shook his white, soft hand with fervent amiability.\"        CHAPTER XXII.    \"All that day I did not speak to my wife. I could not. Her proximity  excited such hatred that I feared myself. At the table she asked me, in  presence of the children, when I was to start upon a journey. I was to  go the following week to an assembly of the Zemstvo, in a neighboring  locality. I named the date. She asked me if I would need anything for  the journey. I did not answer. I sat silent at the table, and silently  I retired to my study. In those last days she never entered my study,  especially at that hour. Suddenly I heard her steps, her walk, and then  a terribly base idea entered my head that, like the wife of Uri, she  wished to conceal a fault already committed, and that it was for  this reason that she came to see me at this unseasonable hour. 'Is it  possible,' thought I, 'that she is coming to see me?' On hearing her  step as it approached: 'If it is to see me that she is coming, then I am  right.'    \"An inexpressible hatred invaded my soul. The steps drew nearer, and  nearer, and nearer yet. Would she pass by and go on to the other room?  No, the hinges creaked, and at the door her tall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#14)"],[1,"civilian by military commission was  annulled'' (``Final Report of the Commission on Industrial  Relations'' (1915) appointed by the United States Congress,''  p. 58).    [34] Literary Digest, May 2 and May 16, 1914.      Meanwhile, though the forms are different, the  aims are very similar, and industrial unionism,  spreading from America, has had a considerable  influence in Great Britain--an influence naturally  reinforced by that of French Syndicalism. It is  clear, I think, that the adoption of industrial rather  than craft unionism is absolutely necessary if Trade  Unionism is to succeed in playing that part in altering  the economic structure of society which its advocates  claim for it rather than for the political  parties. Industrial unionism organizes men, as craft  unionism does not, in accordance with the enemy  whom they have to fight. English unionism is still  very far removed from the industrial form, though  certain industries, especially the railway men, have  gone very far in this direction, and it is notable that  the railway men are peculiarly sympathetic to Syndicalism  and industrial unionism.    Pure Syndicalism, however, is not very likely to  achieve wide popularity in Great Britain. Its spirit  is too revolutionary and anarchistic for our temperament.  It is in the modified form of Guild Socialism  that the ideas derived from the C. G. T. and the I. W.  W. are tending to bear fruit.[35] This movement is as  yet in its infancy and has no great hold upon the rank  and file, but it is being ably advocated by a group  of young men, and is rapidly gaining ground among  those who will form Labor opinion in years to come.  The power of the State has been so much increased  during the war that those who naturally dislike  things as they are, find it more and more difficult to  believe that State omnipotence can be the road to the  millennium. Guild Socialists aim at autonomy in  industry, with consequent curtailment, but not abolition,  of the power of the State. The system which  they advocate is, I believe, the best hitherto proposed,  and the one most likely to secure liberty without  the constant appeals to violence which are to be  feared under a purely Anarchist regime.    [35] The ideas of Guild Socialism were first set forth in  ``National Guilds,'' edited by A. R. Orage (Bell & Sons, 1914),  and in Cole's ``World of Labour'' (Bell & Sons), first published  in 1913. Cole's ``Self-Government in Industry'' (Bell &  Sons, 1917) and Rickett & Bechhofer's ``The Meaning of  National Guilds'' (Palmer & Hayward, 1918) should also be  read, as well as various pamphlets published by the National  Guilds League. The attitude of the Syndicalists to Guild  Socialism is far from sympathetic. An article in ``The  Syndicalist'' for February, 1914, speaks of it in the following  terms: a Middle-class of the middle-class, with all the shortcomings  (we had almost said `stupidities') of the middle-  classes writ large across it, `Guild Socialism' stands forth  as the latest lucubration of the middle-class mind. It is a  `cool steal' of the leading ideas of Syndicalism and a deliberate  perversion of them. . . . We do protest against the `State'  idea . . . in Guild Socialism. Middle-class people, even  when they become Socialists, cannot get rid of the idea that the  working-class is their `inferior'; that the workers need to be  `educated,' drilled, disciplined, and generally nursed for a very  long time before they will be able to walk by themselves. The  very reverse is actually the truth. . . . It is just the plain  truth when we say that the ordinary wage-worker, of average  intelligence, is better capable of taking care of himself than the  half-educated middle-class man who wants to advise him. He  knows how to make the wheels of the world go round.''      The first pamphlet of the ``National Guilds  League'' sets forth their main principles. In industry  each factory is to be free to control its own  methods of production by means of elected managers.  The different factories in a given industry are to be  federated into a National Guild which will deal with  marketing and the general interests of the industry  as a whole. ``The State would own the means of  production as trustee for the community; the Guilds  would manage them, also as trustees for the community,  and would pay to the State a single tax or  rent. Any Guild that chose to set its own interests  above those of the community would be violating  its trust, and would have to bow to the judgment of  a tribunal equally representing the whole body of  producers and the whole body of consumers. This  Joint Committee would be the ultimate sovereign  body, the ultimate appeal court of industry. It  would fix not only Guild taxation, but also standard  prices, and both taxation and prices would be periodically  readjusted by it.'' Each Guild will be  entirely free to apportion what it receives among its  members as it chooses, its members being all those who  work in the industry which it covers. ``The distribution  of this collective Guild income among the  members seems to be a matter for each Guild to decide  for itself. Whether the Guilds would, sooner or later,  adopt the principle of equal payment for every member,  is open to discussion.'' Guild Socialism accepts  from Syndicalism the view that liberty is not to be  secured by making the State the employer: ``The  State and the Municipality as employers have turned  out not to differ essentially from the private capitalist.''  Guild Socialists regard the State as consisting  of the community in their capacity as consumers,  while the Guilds will represent them in their capacity  as producers; thus Parliament and the Guild Congress  will be two co-equal powers representing consumers  and producers respectively. Above both will  be the joint Committee of Parliament and the Guild  Congress for deciding matters involving the interests  of consumers and producers alike. The view of the  Guild Socialists is that State Socialism takes account  of men only as consumers, while Syndicalism takes  account of them only as producers. ``The problem,''  say the Guild Socialists, ``is to reconcile the two  points of view. That is what advocates of National  Guilds set out to do. The Syndicalist has claimed  everything for the industrial organizations of producers,  the Collectivist everything for the territorial  or political organizations of consumers. Both are  open to the same criticism; you cannot reconcile two  points of view merely by denying one of them.''[36]  But although Guild Socialism represents an attempt  at readjustment between two equally legitimate points  of view, its impulse and force are derived from  what it has taken over from Syndicalism. Like Syndicalism;  it desires not primarily to make work better  paid, but to secure this result along with others by  making it in itself more interesting and more democratic  in organization.      [36] The above quotations are all from the first pamphlet of the  National Guilds League, ``National Guilds, an Appeal to Trade  Unionists.''      Capitalism has made of work a purely commercial  activity, a soulless and a joyless thing. But substitute  the national service of the Guilds for the profiteering of  the few; substitute responsible labor for a saleable commodity;  substitute self-government and decentralization  for the bureaucracy and demoralizing hugeness of the  modern State and the modern joint stock company; and  then it may be just once more to speak of a ``joy in  labor,'' and once more to hope that men may be proud  of quality and not only of quantity in their work. There  is a cant of the Middle Ages, and a cant of ``joy in  labor,'' but it were better, perhaps, to risk that cant  than to reconcile ourselves forever to the philosophy of  Capitalism and of Collectivism, which declares that work  is a necessary evil never to be made pleasant, and that  the workers' only hope is a leisure which shall be longer,  richer, and well adorned with municipal amenities.[37]      [37] ``The Guild Idea,'' No. 2 of the Pamphlets of the National  Guilds League, p. 17.        Whatever may be thought of the practicability  of Syndicalism, there is no doubt that the ideas which  it has put into the world have done a great deal  to revive the labor movement and to recall it to certain  things of fundamental importance which it had  been in danger of forgetting. Syndicalists consider  man as producer rather than consumer. They are  more concerned to procure freedom in work than to  increase material well-being. They have revived the  quest for liberty, which was growing somewhat  dimmed under the regime of Parliamentary Socialism,  and they have reminded men that what our modern  society needs is not a little tinkering here and there,  nor the kind of minor readjustments to which the  existing holders of power may readily consent, but  a fundamental reconstruction, a sweeping away of  all the sources of oppression, a liberation of men's  constructive energies, and a wholly new way of  conceiving and regulating production and economic  relations. This merit is so great that, in view of it,  all minor defects become insignificant, and this merit  Syndicalism will continue to possess even if, as a  definite movement, it should be found to have passed  away with the war.        PART II    PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE    CHAPTER IV    WORK AND PAY      THE man who seeks to create a better order of  society has two resistances to contend with: one that  of Nature, the other that of his fellow-men. Broadly  speaking, it is science that deals with the resistance  of Nature, while politics and social organization are  the methods of overcoming the resistance of men.    The ultimate fact in economics is that Nature only  yields commodities as the result of labor. The necessity  of SOME labor for the satisfaction of our wants  is not imposed by political"]]]
