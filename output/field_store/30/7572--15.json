[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],[0,"Wastralls: A Novel (#14)"],[1," Byron, had forgotten even the fear with  which his hungry presence was wont to inspire her, was only conscious of  the many things to be done before she could change her workaday raiment  for clothes befitting the occasion.    To Leadville all seemed as usual, though Gray was perhaps unusually full  of domestic business but, as Christmas was the following week, that was  to be expected.  He heard her low singing voice in the Justice Room as  she flitted about, tidying the place, putting what Sabina needed ready  to her hand; and he decided to smoke his morning pipe in the yard.  He  enjoyed looking on critically while the men worked.  He told himself  that if he had been master they would have done as much again.  He had  said so to Sabina more than once and she had smiled, thinking that she  knew better.    As he watched them that morning, idly content with the fine weather and  with his heart momentarily at rest, he called to mind that on the  previous day he had seen a seal sporting in the surf beyond Morwen Cove.  The end of an Atlantic gale had been lashing the cliff-face and a  procession of monstrous waves had been rolling in out of the grey  distance.  In that welter of far-sounding sea, the living atom had been  at play; and Byron, detecting the springing shadow in the curl of a  wave, the dark speck in the racing tide of the Mad Rip, had reflected  that the last bottle of seal-oil had been sold.  Remembering this, he  had thought the opportunity good and, returning to the kitchen, had  lifted his gun from the leathern thong above the door.  The room still  lay in obscurity, the only light being that of the frugal banked-up  fire.  Long handling, however, had given the gun-butt a bright dark  polish which reflected the faint glow, and Leadville's hand had gone out  instinctively.  Crossing the kitchen to the wall-cupboard on the right  of the slab range he took out the ammunition of which he stood in need.  Some empty bottles, not over-clean, stood on the top shelf, bottles  which were to hold the fresh supply of seal-oil, a medicine for stock  with which he did a trade among the farmers of the neighbouring valleys.  Already Treherne Gaskis had sent once to ask for a pint.  As Byron  slipped the pouch into his pocket, a sound broke the stillness which lay  like dust over the rooms.        \"When the wind is off the hill      Flows the water to the mill...\"    sang a voice in the linhay and, though West-country birds sing sweetly,  they cannot compare for music with West-country maidens.  This voice,  though without much volume, had a tender, joyous note as of one singing  out of a full heart and Leadville hardly recognized it as Gray's. A  narrow gleam of candle-light, edged the dark oblong of the door and,  from beyond, came the brisk slap-smack of a beater upon newly made  butter.    As the man stood to listen, a look, human, eager, almost happy, broke  like a shining over his swarthy face.  The seal-hunt was forgotten, for  the voice singing of the rain had a thrill in it, the thrill of a  love-call and the man's wild heart was assured the call was for him.    For a moment, the habit of years reasserting itself, he glanced at the  door on the other side of the kitchen.  At the end of the long dark  passage his wife still lay abed, or so he hoped.  The swift glance had  been unintentional, the drag of a chain from which he was about to free  himself. He threw back his head, the brooding night of his deep-set eyes  quickened by emotion and, laying the gun on the table among the  breakfast crocks, pushed farther open the door of the linhay.    This room, at once the scullery, larder and dairy of the house, was high  and narrow, with a sloping roof.  A pump stood by the outer door, and  the place was lighted from above; but, as the dawn had not broken, Gray  was butter-making by the light of a candle.  The living jewel of flame  illumined faintly the high and shadowy place, was reflected from the  tiny surfaces of the wet butter and, outlining Gray's figure of a young  and happy maid, shone on her absorbed face.  The butter had \"come\"  quickly. She struck it with the heavy beater until the milk ran  soundingly into the pail below and, as she worked, she sang in that  voice of infinite allure,        \"When the wind is off the land      It brings the weed on to the sand.\"      For some time Leadville, aware that his self-control was limited, had  been trying to get Gray to himself.  Like a wisp of blossomy tamarisk  swaying in the bright upper air, however, she remained tantalizingly out  of reach.  He spent himself in the attempt to lay hands on her, to force  her to hear his suit; but Sabina's presence was for ever being thrust  between him and his objective, until between fury with his wife and  baulked desire, the man was in a dangerous mood.  His highly strung  temperament prevented his being able to seize opportunity by the  forelock; but so often had he met with disappointment, grasping shadows  in place of a woman that, when he realized Gray was alone and ignorant  of his proximity, he obeyed for once a natural prompting.  Stepping  quickly across the linhay, he threw his arms round the busy girl and  sought her lips.    To his almost incredulous joy, Gray did not offer any resistance.  He  had come up behind, had taken her strongly in his arms and the soft  young body yielded as if his coming had been in answer to her own  unexpressed desire.  Though the month was December, spring was in the  air and with an unmistakable murmur of content, Gray abandoned herself.  He bent to hers a transfigured face and then, but not till then, did she  realize she was in Leadville Byron's arms.    Her body stiffened suddenly and, uttering a cry of horror, she began to  struggle.  \"You!\" she cried and made a frantic effort to escape.  So  surprised was he by this change of front that, with his mood in the  balance between love and rage, he let her go.    \"My little umuntz,\" he cried, \"don't 'ee play with me.\"  A moment before  she had yielded herself, her voice had been liquid with invitation, he  had heard in it the mating note.  Now she stared at him from a safe  distance with a spark in her soft eye.    \"If you don't leave me alone,\" she said angrily, \"I shall go home and  never put foot inside this door no more, whiles you're here.\"    Byron stood with his head bent.  He too was angry. He felt defrauded.  Only a moment since she had lain in his embrace, thrilled by his touch,  a warm and palpitating woman.  Now she spoke as if her heart were  virgin.    \"Don't 'ee play with me,\" he said again.  \"I couldn't bear it, I've 'ad  as much as I can stand.  'Ee knaw I love 'ee.\"    \"I--I don't--I don't want to.\"    \"Don't want to?  Don't want to know that night after night I can't sleep  for thinking of 'ee?\"  He struck his chest with a strong blunt-fingered  hand. \"Here's your place, love, and my arm'll ache till I 'old 'ee  again.\"    Hot colour dyed her face.  To think that she should have lain in his  arms!  On that day, too, of all the days in the year, of all the days in  a lifetime!  \"'Tis all a mistake.\"    \"The day'll come when you'll worship the ground I tread on.\"    \"No--never.\"    \"I'll make 'ee love me.  I loved 'ee from the first day you come 'ere.  I've never wanted nobody but you and I've wanted 'ee ever since I did  see your 'andsome face about Wastralls and heard you singin', 'appy as a  greybird.  Wastralls an' you, they go together in my mind. I love 'ee,  Gray, and you know what that means to a man like me, what cares for  nobody and nothing.  I'm eaten up with the love of you.  I'd do anything  to get 'ee.  I must 'av 'ee and I will 'av 'ee.\"  He came a step nearer,  but she drew back.    \"Leave me alone, leave me alone.\"    \"Leave 'ee alone?  I want to be kissin' of 'ee all the day.\"    The girl was trembling.  She leant one arm upon the stone slab behind  her, and the shock of its coldness was a steadying influence.  \"I bain't  gwine let you kiss me. I'd rather slap yer face for yer.  What d'yer  think then?\"    He coaxed her tenderly.  \"Bain't I worth 'avin' then?\"    \"I bain't gwine 'av nothing to do with 'ee.  I wouldn't 'ave 'ee for the  world.\"  Taking up one of the butter pats she began mechanically shaping  the mass.    \"What's the matter with me that you won't 'av nothing to do with me?\"  Straightening himself, he opened out unusually broad shoulders and the  candlelight revealed a face of black shadows and strong saliences.  How  strong, how ruthless, how confident he looked!  Gray felt her old fear  returning, she could not believe that this strange man would be held in  check by any of the received standards.    \"You'm married and old enough to be my father.\"    She clinched the matter: \"You'm married to Aunt S'bina.\"    He laughed contemptuously.  \"Ah, but you would 'av me, if I was a  widower, a widower wi' Wastralls for my own.\"    Putting down the pat, Gray turned at that in a sudden ruffle of  indignation.    \"Take an' 'old your tongue,\" she commanded.  \"I'm ashamed of 'ee to talk  like that.\"    \"Well,\" he persisted, only anxious for her to realize that he meant to  make her mistress of all he hoped for in life--Wastralls.  \"I may be  before long.  I don't believe the missis'll live very long.\"    \"I hate that kind of talk!\"    Her anger, a spark in the dark eye, a flush on the soft cheek, became  her and he stared admiringly.  Her wrath was like the peck of a captive  bird and, whatever she might say, from henceforth she would know that  his pursuing love was no light matter.  \"I do love 'ee so,\" he pleaded,  his voice dropping to an intimate compelling whisper.  \"I tremble when  you come into the room. But I can't set 'ere and not touch 'ee; I 'ave  to go out on cliff 'till I've walked it down.  Seems sometimes at night  as if you was near me and I put out my 'and--ah, if you was there I  should die of joy.  You'm mine and I've waited so long.  I can't bear  it.  I can't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#14)"],[1,"in force. To her relief, Mrs. Cuthell, so  to speak, took command, and proceeded to make up the sets for tennis,  explaining that _she_ knew how everyone played, which, of course, Mrs.  Crayfield could not; and soon the courts were filled with vigorous  people, running and shouting; tennis balls flew, the little boys darted  after them, non-players gathered in knots about the tables, or settled  in the easy chairs, and it was all very pleasant and cheerful. Stella,  feeling excited and important, set herself to do duty as hostess. She  conversed with Mrs. Beard, and duly admired the three little girls who  hung round their mother; two were twins; the third was only a year  younger, which accounted for their all looking about the same age and  size. Mrs. Beard said that the number of native Christians in the Rassih  district was on the increase; she hoped Mrs. Crayfield would visit the  school and distribute prizes.... Stella then listened to Mrs. Antonio's  artless admiration of her daughter \"Pussy,\" who played tennis well, and  was certainly a handsome creature with rich colouring and brilliant dark  eyes. Why Mrs. Piggott should have branded the Antonios as \"practically  natives\" Stella could not quite understand, though they seemed  different, it was true, from the rest of the official community, and  they spoke with a curious accent. Dr. Antonio was a stumpy,  good-humoured person, with a large stomach about which he had bandaged a  crimson silk sash; he had long, straggling whiskers, obviously dyed, and  a dark, puffy face. Mrs. Antonio was sallow and thin, and had regular  features inherited by her daughter, whom she adored with the frankest  extravagance. She was drawing Mrs. Crayfield's attention to Pussy's  perfect complexion, when Mrs. Piggott joined the group, and remarked  pointedly that Mrs. Foster's sister, who was playing tennis in the same  set with Pussy, was to be envied her lovely white skin, fair hair, and  blue eyes.    \"But how pastee!\" objected Mrs. Antonio. \"She had a nice colour in her  cheeks when she came out last year from home; now it is all gone, while  my Pussy she is like a rose.\"    \"Well, you see,\" said Mrs. Piggott, with the air of a kindly  instructress, \"Pussy is accustomed to the climate; you must remember  that she has never been to England!\"    Stella glanced nervously at Mrs. Antonio, but Pussy's mother merely  nodded complacently and turned to her hostess. \"My Pussy, she is so  healthy and strong. It is luckee, for this is a very hot place, Mrs.  Crayfield.\"    \"So I understand,\" returned Stella politely; and then Mrs. Antonio began  to talk about punkah coolies and their perversities during the hot  season, and alluded to something called \"tatties.\" Mrs. Piggott bemoaned  the difficulty of procuring ice when it was most needed. Mrs. Beard  said, with self-righteous resentment, that _Mission people_ had to  endure the heat without such alleviations; and Mrs. Antonio confessed  that ice gave her \"pain at stomach,\" but that Pussy liked to suck lumps,  which was bad for her prettee teeth.    During this dull conversation among their elders the Beard children  took courage and wandered afield; they made for a big mango tree, behind  which they appeared to find some attraction.    As each set of tennis came to an end the players gathered about the  refreshment tables; trays were handed round by the white-clad servants  under the authoritative supervision of Sher Singh, and suddenly Mrs.  Antonio transferred her attention from Pussy to Colonel Crayfield's  bearer.    \"That man! How does he behave to you, Mrs. Crayfield, dear?\" she  inquired with genuine, if inquisitive, solicitude.    Stella resented the question, conscious as she was of her subordination  to the rule of Sher Singh. She felt sensitively suspicious that the  little gang of ladies were one and all aware of her humiliating  position.    \"He seems to be a very good servant,\" she replied evasively, \"and he is  devoted to my husband.\"    Mrs. Cuthell joined in. \"Oh, yes, and Colonel Crayfield to him; everyone  knows that! But all the same, bachelors' old servants are invariably  antagonistic to a mistress. It's a mistake to keep them. When you have  learnt something about Indian housekeeping you will find out how he has  been feathering his nest all these years!\"    It was Mrs. Piggott's turn next. \"How well I remember the bother I had  with my husband's old khansamah when first we were married. He used to  commit endless atrocities, and then declare he had only obeyed my  orders. Edward always believed him! However, I soon put my foot down and  got rid of him. There was such a row!\"    \"I go to the bazaar myself,\" said Mrs. Beard somewhat irrelevantly,  \"and do my own marketing.\"    \"Ah! but of course _your_ servants are Christians,\" argued Mrs. Piggott,  covert contempt in her tone, \"and we all know what that means!\"    Mrs. Beard reddened. \"Which shows how lamentably ignorant you all are,\"  she retorted. \"You think that because a native is a Christian that he  must be a rogue. I admit that he generally is a rogue to start with, but  not because he is a Christian. It is because, unfortunately, our  converts are mostly drawn from a class that has nothing to lose by  embracing the true religion, people who are outcasts by birth, cut off  from all spiritual advantages, oppressed and despised, jungle folk,  gypsies, many of them thieves by profession, and such like. So far we  have hardly tapped the better born classes, and whenever we do it is a  real triumph, for they have everything to lose from a worldly point of  view. But we know we must begin from the bottom and work upwards, and  already great progress has been made, though it is necessarily slow, and  the fight is often disheartening....\"    Stella looked at the faded, dowdy little woman with a new interest. Mrs.  Beard and her husband were working for India, doing great work, just as  great in its way as the Carringtons had done in the past, and as their  kind were doing in the present. She wished she could help the Beards by  engaging a whole staff of Christian converts as servants! But so far she  was powerless, there was nothing she could do; and as the atmosphere had  become slightly uncomfortable she was about to try and change the  subject when, to her relief, a diversion was caused by Mrs. Beard's  discovery that her offspring were disporting themselves behind the mango  tree with some native children, though, surely, according to Mission  theories, Mrs. Beard should have felt no displeasure?    \"Martha, Mary, Deborah!\" she called sternly, \"come here at once!\"    This summons was not obeyed, but apparently it caused an animated  argument between the padre's children and their Oriental playmates.  Again Mrs. Beard raised a voice of command, and presently Martha and  Mary and Deborah emerged from the shelter of the tree, escorting a small  brown boy attired in a red cotton garment and an embroidered skull cap.    \"Mother,\" shouted the three little girls in chorus, \"this dear boy wants  to come to our school. We will make him a Christian, mayn't we?\"    To their mortified astonishment this praiseworthy plan did not meet with  the encouragement it deserved. The Commissioner's head servant pounced  on the red-coated pagan and took him, howling loudly, from his friends.    Stella rose. \"Sher Singh!\" she called angrily, \"let the child alone!\" Of  course, the man heard her order, must have known, though perforce she  had spoken in English, what she wished him to do; but he paid no  attention, just bore the child, kicking and screaming, towards the  servants' quarters.    Martha and Mary and Deborah ran to their mother and buried their faces  in her skirt. Stella looked round for Robert; he was drinking a whisky  and soda, regardless of the scene. Mrs. Cuthell laid a restraining hand  on her arm. \"It's quite right, Mrs. Crayfield,\" she said with reassuring  inflection. \"The servants' children must be kept in the background,  otherwise they would swarm all over the place.\"    But Stella felt she had been publicly flouted by Sher Singh, and though  for the moment she was helpless, she resolved to tell Robert, when the  party should be over, that for the future she expected Sher Singh to  obey her. Meantime, while Mrs. Cuthell made up fresh sets of tennis, she  apologised prettily to Mrs. Beard.    But when the guests had all departed, with many gratifying assurances of  their enjoyment, her courage dwindled. Since the night of her arrival at  Rassih she had dreaded Robert's anger; the unpleasant memory remained  with her so vividly--the uproar, the helpless alarm of the servants, her  own fear and dismay. Never before in the whole course of her sheltered  existence had she seen anyone so angry. And now, were she to protest  against Sher Singh's behaviour, what if he should rage at her in the  same manner? As he passed into his dressing-room she recognised, with a  sinking at her heart, that she was afraid of her husband, abjectly  afraid, ten thousand times more afraid of him then she had ever been of  grandmamma. She dared not risk a scene, dared not stand up for herself.  She would let the matter rest for the present, wait till Sher Singh  disobeyed her again. After all, perhaps the man had not heard, or had  not understood her this afternoon.    However, towards the end of dinner she happened to look up and catch  Sher Singh regarding her with an expression of such venomous hatred that  she barely checked an exclamation. Meeting her astonished gaze, he  turned away abruptly to the sideboard, and she drew in her breath,  shivering. When, a little later, he was pouring port into Robert's  glass, she observed that his hand shook, that his eyes were heavy and  bloodshot; there was something strange in his appearance.    She tried to dismiss the incident from her mind, turned her thoughts to  some advice Mrs. Beard had given her as to studying Hindustani."]]]
