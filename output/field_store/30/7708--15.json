Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"into a new mode of existence: it is the eternal, the invariable, the  unconquerable law of Nature, to which the individuals of his order, each  in his turn, is obliged to submit.    The human body is said to be in order, when its various component parts  act in that mode, from which results the conservation of the whole; from  which emanates that which is the tendency of his actual existence;  in other words, when all the impulse he receives, all the motion he  communicates, tends to preserve his health, to render him happy, by  promoting the happiness of his fellow men. He is said to be in health  when the fluids and solids of his body concur to render him robust, to  keep his mind in vigour; when each lends mutual aid towards this end. He  is said to be in _confusion_, or in ill health, whenever this tendency  is disturbed; when any of the essential parts of his body cease to  concur to his preservation, or to fulfil its peculiar functions. This  it is that happens in a state of sickness, in which, however, the motion  excited in the human machine is as necessary, is regulated by laws as  certain, as natural, as invariable, as that which concurs to produce  health. Sickness merely produces in him a new order of motion, a new  series of action, a new chain of things. Man dies: to him, this appears  the greatest confusion he can experience; his body is no longer what it  was--its parts no longer concur to the same end--his blood has lost  its circulation--he is deprived of feeling--his ideas have vanished--he  thinks no more--his desires have fled--death is the epoch, the cessation  of his human existence.--His frame becomes an inanimate mass, by the  subtraction of those principles by which it was animated; that is, which  made it act after a determinate manner: its tendency has received a  new direction; its action is changed; the motion excited in its ruins  conspires to a new end. To that motion, the harmony of which he calls  order, which produced life, sentiment, thought, passions, health,  succeeds a series of motion of another species; that, nevertheless,  follows laws as necessary as the first; all the parts of the dead  man conspire to produce what is called dissolution, fermentation,  putrefaction: these new modes of being, of acting, are just as natural  to man, reduced to this state, as sensibility, thought, the periodical  motion of the blood, &c. were to the living man: his essence having  changed, his mode of action can no longer be the same. To that regulated  motion, to that necessary action, which conspired to the production  of life, succeeds that determinate motion, that series of action which  concurs to produce the dissolution of the dead carcass; the dispersion  of its parts; the formation of new combinations, from which result new  beings; and which, as we have before seen, is the immutable order of  active Nature.    How then can it be too often repeated, that relatively to the great  whole, all the motion of beings, all their modes of action, can never be  but in order, that is to say, are always conformable to Nature; that in  all the stages through which beings are obliged to pass, they invariably  act after a mode necessarily subordinate to the universal whole? To say  more, each individual being always acts in order; all its actions,  the whole system of its motion, are the necessary consequence of its  peculiar mode of existence; whether that be momentary or durable. Order,  in political society, is the effect of a necessary series of ideas,  of wills, of actions, in those who compose it; whose movements are  regulated in a manner, either calculated to maintain its indivisibility,  or to hasten its dissolution. Man constituted, or modified, in the  manner we term virtuous, acts necessarily in that mode, from whence  results the welfare of his associates: the man we stile wicked, acts  necessarily in that mode, from whence springs the misery of his fellows:  his Nature, being essentially different, he must necessarily act after  a different mode: his individual order is at variance, but his relative  order is complete: it is equally the essence of the one, to promote  happiness, as it is of the other to induce misery.    Thus, order and confusion in individual beings, is nothing more than  the manner of man's considering the natural and necessary effects, which  they produce relatively to himself. He fears the wicked man; he says  that he will carry confusion into society, because he disturbs its  tendency and places obstacles to its happiness. He avoids a falling  stone, because it will derange in him the order necessary to his  conservation. Nevertheless, order and confusion, are always, as we  have shewn, consequences, equally necessary to either the transient or  durable state of beings. It is in order that fire burns, because it  is of its essence to burn; on the other hand, it is in order, that an  intelligent being should remove himself from whatever can disturb his  mode of existence. A being, whose organization renders him sensible,  must in virtue of his essence, fly from every thing that can injure his  organs, or that can place his existence in danger.    Man calls those beings _intelligent_, who are organized after his  own manner; in whom he sees faculties proper for their preservation;  suitable to maintain their existence in the order that is convenient to  them; that can enable them to take the necessary measures towards this  end, with a consciousness of the motion they undergo. From hence, it  will be perceived, that the faculty called intelligence, consists in a  possessing capacity to act comformably to a known end, in the being  to which it is attributed. He looks upon these beings as deprived of  intelligence, in which he finds no conformity with himself; in whom  he discovers neither the same construction, nor the same faculties:  of which he knows neither the essence, the end to which they tend, the  energies by which they act, nor the order that is necessary to them. The  whole cannot have a distinct name, or end, because there is nothing out  of itself, to which it can have a tendency. If it be in himself, that  he arranges the idea of _order_, it is also in himself, that he draws up  that of _intelligence_. He refuses to ascribe it to those beings, who  do not act after his own manner: he accords it to all those whom he  supposes to act like himself: the latter he calls intelligent agents:  the former blind causes; that is to say, intelligent agents who act  by _chance_: thus chance is an empty word without sense, but which  is always opposed to that of intelligence, without attaching any  determinate, or any certain idea.    Man, in fact, attributes to _chance_ all those effects, of which the  connection they have with their causes is not seen. Thus he uses the  word _chance_, to cover his ignorance of those natural causes, which  produce visible effects, by means which he cannot form an idea of; or  that act by a mode of which he does not perceive the order; or whose  system is not followed by actions conformable to his own. As soon as he  sees, or believes he sees, the order of action, or the manner of motion,  he attributes this order to an _intelligence_; which is nothing more  than a quality borrowed from himself--from his own peculiar mode of  action--from the manner in which he is himself affected.    Thus an _intelligent being_ is one who thinks, who wills, and who acts,  to compass an end. If so, he must have organs, an aim conformable to  those of man: therefore, to say Nature is governed by an intelligence,  is to affirm that she is governed by a being, furnished with organs;  seeing that without this organic construction, he can neither have  sensations, perceptions, ideas, thought, will, plan, nor action which he  understands.    Man always makes himself the center of the universe: it is to himself  that he relates all he beholds. As soon as he believes he discovers a  mode of action that has a conformity with his own, or some phenomenon  that interests his feelings, he attributes it to a cause that resembles  himself--that acts after his manner--that has faculties similar to those  he possesses--whose interests are like his own--whose projects are in  unison with and have the same tendency as those he himself indulges: in  short, it is from himself, or the properties which actuate him, that he  forms the model of this cause. It is thus that man beholds, out of his  own species, nothing but beings who act differently from himself;  yet believes that he remarks in Nature an order similar to his own  ideas--views conformable to those which he himself possesses. He  imagines that Nature is governed by a cause whose intelligence is  conformable to his own, to whom he ascribes the honor of the order which  he believes he witnesses--of those views that fall in with those that  are peculiar to himself--of an aim which quadrates with that which is  the great end of all his own actions. It is true that man, feeling his  incapability of producing the vast, the multiplied effects of which he  witnesses the operation, when contemplating the universe, was under the  necessity of making a distinction between himself and the cause which  he supposed to be the author of such stupendous effects; he believed  he removed every difficulty, by amplifying in this cause all those  faculties of which he was himself in possession; adding others of which  his own self-love made him desirous, or which he thought would render  his being more perfect: thus, he gave JUPITER wings, with the faculty of  assuming any form he might deem convenient: it was thus, by degrees,  he arrived at forming an idea of that intelligent cause, which he has  placed above Nature, to preside over action--to give her that motion  of which he has chosen to believe she was in herself incapable. He  obstinately persists in regarding this Nature as a heap of dead, inert  matter, without "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"  man, because nature had never constructed any thing like them, whereby  he was enabled to form a judgment. Man was assured they were eminently  good--that it was visible in all their actions. Now goodness is a known  quality, recognizable in some beings of the human species; this is,  above every other, a property he is desirous to find in all those upon  whom he is in a state of dependence; but he is unable to bestow the  title of good on any among his fellows, except their actions produce on  him those effects which he approves--that he finds in unison with his  existence--in conformity with his own peculiar modes of thinking. It was  evident, according to this reasoning, these ethnic gods did not impress  him with this idea; they were said to be equally the authors of his  pleasures, as of his pains, which were to be either secured or averted  by sacrifices: thus when man suffered by contagion, when he was the  victim of shipwreck, when his country was desolated by war, when he saw  whole nations devoured by rapacious earthquakes, when he was a prey to  the keenest sorrows, he at least was unable to conceive the bounty of  those beings. How could he perceive the beautiful order which they had  introduced into the world, while he groaned under such a multitude of  calamities? How was he able to discern the beneficence of men whom he  beheld sporting as it were with his species? How could he conceive the  consistency of those who destroyed that which he was assured they had  taken such pains to establish, solely for his own peculiar happiness?  But had his mind been properly enlightened, had he been taught to know,  that nature, acting by unerring laws, produces all the phenomena he  beholds as a necessary consequence of her primitive impulse--that  like the rest of nature he was himself subjected to the general  operation--that no peculiar exemption had been made in his behalf--that  sacrifices were useless--that the great _Parent of parents_, equally  mindful of all his creatures, had set in action with the most consummate  wisdom an invariable system, the apparent, casual evils of which were  ever counterbalanced by the resulting good; that without repining, it  was his duty, his interest, to submit; at the same time to examine with  sedulity, to search with earnestness, into the recesses of this nature  for remedies to the sorrows he endured. If he had been thus instructed,  we should never behold him arraigning either the kindness, the wisdom,  or the consistency of the gods; he would neither have ascribed his  sufferings to the malicious interference of inferior deities, so  derogatory to the divine majesty of the _Great Cause of causes_, nor  would he have taxed with either inconsistency or unkindness, that nature  which cannot act otherwise than she does. Perhaps of all the ideas that  can be infused into the mind of man, none is more really subversive of  his true happiness, none more incompatible with the reality of things,  than that which persuades him he is himself a privileged being, the king  of a nature where every thing is submitted to laws, the extent of which  his finite mind cannot possibly conceive. Even admitting it should  ultimately turn out to be a fact, he has yet no one positive evidence  to justify the assumption; experience, which after all must always prove  the best criterion for his judgment, daily proves, that in every thing  he is subjected, like every other part of nature, to those invariable  decrees from which nothing that he beholds is exempted.    Feeble monarch! of whom a grain of sand, some atoms of bile, some  misplaced humours, destroy at once the existence and the reign: yet thou  pretendest every thing was made for thee! Thou desirest that the entire  of nature should be thy domain, and thou canst not even defend thyself  from the slightest of her shocks! Thou makest to thyself a god for  thyself alone; thou supposest that he unceasingly occupieth himself only  for thy peculiar happiness; thou imaginest every thing was made solely  for thy pleasure; and, following up thy presumptuous ideas, thou hast  the audacity to call nature good or bad as thy weak intellect inclines:  thou darest to think that the kindness exhibited towards thee, in common  with other beings, is contradicted by the evil genii thy fancy has  created! Dost thou not see that those beasts which thou supposest  submitted to thine empire, frequently devour thy fellow-creatures;  that fire consumeth them; that the ocean swalloweth them up; that those  elements of which thou sometimes admirest the order, which sometimes  thou accusest of confusion, frequently sweep them off the face of the  earth; dost thou not see that all this is necessarily what it must be;  that thou art not in any manner consulted in any of this phenomena?  Indeed, according to thine own ideas, if thou wast to examine them with  care, dost thou not admit that thy gods are the universal cause of all;  that they maintain the whole by the destruction of its parts. Are they  not then according to thyself, the gods of nature--of the ocean--of  rivers--of mountains--of the earth, in which they occupiest, so very  small a space--of all those other globes that thou seest roll in  the regions of space--of those orbs that revolve round the sun that  enlighteneth thee?--Cease, then, obstinately to persist in beholding  nothing but thy sickly self in nature; do not flatter thyself that the  human race, which reneweth itself, which disappeareth like the leaves  on the trees, can absorb all the care, can ingross all the tenderness  of that universal being, who, according to thyself, properly understood,  ruleth the destiny of all things. Submit thyself in silence to mandates  which thy unavailing prayers; can never change; to a wisdom which  thy imbecility cannot fathom; to the unerring shafts of a fate, which  nothing but thine own vanity, aided by thy perverse ignorance, could  ever question, being the best possible good that can befall thee! which  if thou couldst alter, thou wouldst with thy defective judgment render  worse! What is the human race compared to the earth? What is this earth  compared to the sun? What is our sun compared to those myriads of suns  which at immense distances occupy the regions of space? not for the  purpose of diverting thy weak eyes; not with a view to excite thy stupid  admiration, as thou vainly imaginest; since multitudes of them are  placed out of the range of thy visual organs: but to occupy the place  which necessity hath assigned them. Mortal, feeble and vain! restore  thyself to thy proper sphere; acknowledge every where the effect  of necessity; recognize in thy benefits, behold in thy sorrows, the  different modes of action of those various beings endowed with such a  variety of properties, which surround thee; of which the macrocosm is  the assemblage; and do not any longer suppose that this nature, much  less its great cause, can possess such incompatible qualities as would  be the result of human views or of visionary ideas, which have no  existence but in thyself.    As long as theologians shall continue obstinately bent to make man the  model of their gods; as long ask they shall pertinaciously undertake to  explain the nature of these gods, which they will never be able to  do, but after human ideas, although they may associate the most  heterogeneous properties, the most discrepant functions; so long, I say,  experience will contradict at every moment the beneficent views they,  attach to their divinities; it will be in vain that they call them  good: man, reasoning thus, will never be able to find good but in those  objects which impel him in a manner favourable to his actual mode  of existence; he always finds confusion in that which fills him with  grievous sensations; he calls evil every thing that painfully affects  him, even cursorily; those beings that produce in him two modes of  feeling, so very opposite to each other, he will naturally conclude are  sometimes favourable, sometimes unfavourable to him; at least, if he  will not allow that they act necessarily, consequently are neither one  nor the other, he will say that a world where he experiences so much  evil cannot be submitted to men who are perfectly good; on the other  hand, he will also assume that a world in which man receives so many  benefits, cannot be governed by those who are without kindness. Thus  he is obliged to admit of two principles equally powerful, who are  in hostility with each other; or rather, he must agree that the same  persons are alternately kind and unkind; this after all is nothing more  than avowing they cannot be otherwise than they are; in this case it  would be useless to sacrifice to them--to make solicitation; seeing  it would be nothing but _destiny_--the necessity of things submitted  invariable rules.    In order to justify these beings, constructed upon mortal principles,  from injustice, in consequence of the evils the human species  experience, the theologian is reduced to the necessity of calling them  punishments inflicted for the transgressions of man. But then these  general calamities include all men. Some, at least, may be supposed not  to have offended. Thus he involves contradictions he finds it difficult  to reconcile; to effectuate this he makes his _anthropomorphites_  immaterial--incorporeal; that is, he says they are the negation of every  thing of which he has a knowledge; consequently, beings who can have no  relation with corporeal beings: and this avails him no better, as  will be evident by reasoning on the subject. To offend any one, is to  diminish the sum of his happiness; it is to afflict him, to deprive  him of something, to make him experience a painful sensation. How is it  possible man can operate on such beings; how can the physical actions  of a material substance have any influence over an immaterial substance,  devoid of parts, having no point of contact."]]]
