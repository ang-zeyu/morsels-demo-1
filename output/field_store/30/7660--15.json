[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#14)"],[1," they would  venture quite close to me, showing as little suspicion as young  chickens. The adults, however, although so much less shy than birds of  other species, were extremely suspicious, snatching up the bread and  flying away; or, if they remained, hopping about in a startled manner,  craning their necks to view me, and making so many gestures and motions,  and little chirps of alarm, that presently the young would become  infected with fear. The lesson was taught them in a surprisingly short  time; their suspicion was seen to increase day by day, and about a week  later they were scarcely to be distinguished, in behaviour from the  adults. It is plain that, with these little birds, fear of man is an  associate feeling, and that, unless it had been taught them, his  presence would trouble them as little as does that of horse, sheep, or  cow. But how about the larger species, used as food, and which have had  a longer and sadder experience of man's destructive power?    The rhea, or South American ostrich, philosophers tell us, is a very  ancient bird on the earth; and from its great size and inability to  escape by flight, and its excellence as food, especially to savages, who  prefer fat rank-flavoured flesh, it must have been systematically  persecuted by man as long as, or longer than, any bird now existing on  the globe. If fear of man ever becomes hereditary in birds, we ought  certainly to find some trace of such an instinct in this species. I have  been unable to detect any, though I have observed scores of young rheas  in captivity, taken before the parent bird had taught them what to fear.  I also once kept a brood myself, captured just after they had hatched  out. With regard to food they were almost, or perhaps quite,  independent, spending most of the time catching flies, grasshoppers, and  other insects with surprising dexterity; but of the dangers encompassing  the young rhea they knew absolutely frothing. They would follow me about  as if they took me for their parent; and, whenever I imitated the loud  snorting or rasping warning-call emitted the old bird in moments of  danger, they would to me in the greatest terror, though no animal was in  sight, and, squatting at my feet, endeavour to conceal themselves by  thrusting their heads and long necks up my trousers. If I had caused a  person to dress in white or yellow clothes for several consecutive days,  and had then uttered the warning cry each time he showed himself to the  birds, I have no doubt that they would soon have acquired a habit of  running in terror from him, even without the warning cry, and that the  fear of a person in white or yellow would have continued all their  lives. Up to within about twenty years ago, rheas were seldom or never  shot in La Plata and Patagonia, but were always hunted on horseback and  caught with the bolas. The sight of a mounted man would set them off at  once, while a person on foot could walk quite openly to within easy  shooting distance of them; yet their fear of a horseman dates only two  hundred years back--a very short time, when we consider that, before the  Indian borrowed the horse from the invader, he must have systematically  pursued the rhea on foot for centuries. The rhea changed its habits when  the hunter changed his, and now, if an _estanciero_ puts down ostrich  hunting on his estate, in a very few years the birds, although wild  birds still, become as fearless and familiar as domestic animals. I have  known old and ill-tempered males to become a perfect nuisance on some  estancias, running after and attacking every person, whether on foot or  on horseback, that ventured near them. An old instinct of a whole race  could not be thus readily lost here and there on isolated estates  wherever a proprietor chose to protect his birds for half a dozen years.    I suppose the Talegallus--the best-known brush-turkey--must be looked on  as an exception to all other birds with regard to the point I am  considering; for this abnormal form buries its eggs in the huge mound  made by the male, and troubles herself no more about them. When the  young is fully developed it simply kicks the coffin to pieces in which  its mother interred it, and, burrowing its way up to the sunshine,  enters on the pleasures and pains of an independent existence from  earliest infancy--that is, if a species born into the world in full  possession of all the wisdom of the ancients, can be said ever to know  infancy. At all events, from Mr. Bartlett's observations on the young  hatched in the Zoological Gardens, it appears that they took no notice  of the old birds, but lived quite independently from the moment they  came out of the ground, even flying up into a tree and roosting  separately at night. I am not sure, however, that these observations are  quite conclusive; for it is certain that captivity plays strange pranks  with the instincts of some species, and it is just possible that in a  state of nature the old birds exercise at first some slight parental  supervision, and, like all other species, have a peculiar cry to warn  the young of the dangers to be avoided. If this is not so, then the  young Talegallus must fly or hide with instinctive tear from every  living thing that approaches it. I, at any rate, find it hard to believe  that it has a knowledge, independent of experience, of the different  habits of man and kangaroo, and dis-criminates at first sight between  animals that are dangerous to it and those that are not. This  interesting point will probably never be determined, as, most unhappily,  the Australians are just now zealously engaged in exterminating their  most wonderful bird for the sake of its miserable flesh; and with less  excuse than the Maories could plead with regard to the moa, since they  cannot deny that they have mutton and rabbit enough to satisfy hunger.    Whether birds fear or have instinctive knowledge of any of their enemies  is a much larger question. Species that run freely on the ground from  the time of quitting the shell know their proper food, and avoid  whatever is injurious. Have all young birds a similarly discriminating  instinct with regard to their enemies? Darwin says, \"Fear of any  particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in  nestling birds.\" Here, even man seems to be included among the enemies  feared instinctively; and in another passage he says, \"Young chickens  have lost, wholly from habit, that fear of the dog and cat which, no  doubt, was originally instinctive in them.\" My own observations point to  a contrary conclusion; and I may say that I have had unrivalled  opportunities for studying the habits of young birds.    Animals of all classes, old and young, shrink with instinctive fear from  any strange object approaching them. A piece of newspaper carried  accidentally by the wind is as great an object of terror to an  inexperienced young bird as a buzzard sweeping down with death in its  talons. Among birds not yet able to fly there are, however, some curious  exceptions; thus the young of most owls and pigeons are excited to anger  rather than fear, and, puffing themselves up, snap and strike at an  intruder with their beaks. Other fledglings simply shrink down in the  nest or squat close on the ground, their fear, apparently, being in  proportion to the suddenness with which the strange animal or object  comes on them; but, if the deadliest enemy approaches with slow caution,  as snakes do--and snakes must be very ancient enemies to birds--there is  no fear or suspicion shown, even when the enemy is in full view and  about to strike. This, it will be understood, is when no warning-cry is  uttered by the parent bird. This shrinking, and, in some cases, hiding  from an object corning swiftly towards them, is the \"wildness_\"_ of  young birds, which, Darwin says again, is greater in wild than in  domestic species. Of the extreme tameness of the young rhea I have  already spoken; I have also observed young tinamous, plovers, coots,  &c., hatched by fowls, and found them as incapable of distinguishing  friend from foe as the young of domestic birds. The only difference  between the young of wild and tame is that the former are, as a rule,  much more sprightly and active. But there are many exceptions; and if  this greater alertness and activity is what is meant by \"wildness,\" then  the young of some wild birds--rhea, crested screamer, &c.--are actually  much tamer than our newly-hatched chickens and ducklings.    To return to what may be seen in nestling birds, n very young, and  before their education has begun, if quietly approached and touched,  they open their bills and take food as readily from a man as from the  parent bird. But if while being thus fed the parent returns and emits  the warning note, they instantly cease their hunger-cries, close their  gaping mouths, and crouch down frightened in the nest. This fear caused  by the parent bird's warning note begins to manifest itself even before  the young are hatched--and my observations on this point refer to  several species in three widely separated orders. When the little  prisoner is hammering at its shell, and uttering its feeble _peep,_ as  if begging to be let out, if the warning note is uttered, even at a  considerable distance, the strokes and complaining instantly cease, and  the chick will then remain quiescent in the shell for a long time, or  until the parent, by a changed note, conveys to it an intimation that  the danger is over. Another proof that the nestling has absolutely no  instinctive knowledge of particular enemies, but is taught to fear them  by the parents, is to be found in the striking contrast between the  habits of parasitical and genuine young in the nest, and after they have  left it, while still unable to find their own food. I have had no  opportunities of observing the habits of the young cuckoo in England  with regard to this point,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#14)"],[1,"responsibility, and later--though the evidence on this point  is not specific--in accordance with influences from Paris; and that  during his imprisonment an attempt was made to deprive him of credit for  his discoveries by the publication of the first volume of the French  official history and its accompanying atlas.    The atlas published in 1807* (* The date on the imprint of volume 1,  though the charts bear the date 1808. A second part of the atlas,  containing a few additional small charts, was issued in 1811.) contained  two large charts, the work of Lieutenant Louis de Freycinet. The first  was a \"Carte generale de la Nouvelle Hollande,\" with the title inscribed  upon a scroll clutched in the talons of an imperial eagle, a most  fearsome wild-fowl, that with aggressive beak and flaming eye seemed to  assert a claim to the regions denominated on what it held. This was the  most complete map of Australia published up to the date named. The second  was entitled \"Carte generale de la Terre Napoleon.\" In this case the  title was held by feathered Mercury in graceful flight, displaying the  motto \"Orbis Australis dulces exuviae.\" An exquisite little vignette  under the title (by Lesueur) should not escape notice. Upon both charts,  the whole of southern Australia, from Wilson's Promontory to Cape Adieu  in the Bight, was styled Terre Napoleon. To nearly every cape, bay,  island, peninsula, strait, and gulf in this extensive region was affixed  a name, in most cases, though not in all, that of some Frenchman of  eminence during the revolutionary and Napoleonic period. The Spencer's  Gulf and St. Vincent's Gulf, which Flinders had discovered, were  respectively named Golfe Bonaparte and Golfe Josephine.* (* The latter  was named \"in honour of our august Empress,\" said Peron. It was a pretty  piece of courtiership; but unfortunately Napoleon's nuptial arrangements  were in a state of flux, and when the trenchant Quarterly reviewer of  1810 came to discuss the work, the place of Josephine was occupied by  Marie Louise. The reviewer saucily suggested: \"Bonaparte has since  changed it for Louisa's Gulf.\") The large island which Flinders had  pointed out to Baudin, and which he informed that officer he had named  Kangaroo Island, became Ile Decres. The Yorke's Peninsula of Flinders was  styled Presqu'Ile Cambaceres; his Investigator Strait became Detroit de  Lacepede; and his Backstairs Passage, Detroit de Colbert. To-day the  Terre Napoleon charts look like a partial index to the Pantheon and Pere  Lachaise. Laplace, Buffon, Volney, Maupertuis, Montaigne, Lannes, Pascal,  Talleyrand, Berthier, Lafayette, Descartes, Racine, Moliere, Bernadotte,  Lafontein, Condillac, Bossuet, Colbert, Rabelais, D'Alembert, Sully,  Bayard, Fenelon, Voltaire,* (* Voltaire's name is on the Terre Napoleon  sectional chart, but it seems to have been crowded out of the large Carte  Generale. As there is no actual bay in Spencer's Gulf to correspond with  the Baie Voltaire shown on the Terre Napoleon chart, the omission does  not matter much. But one would have liked to have Voltaire's opinion on  the subject of his exclusion.) Jeanne d'Arc, L'Hopital, Massena, Turenne,  Jussieu, Murat--soldiers, statesmen, scientists, authors, philosophers,  adorn with their memorable names these most un-Gallic shores. The  Bonaparte family was pleasantly provided for. Thus we find the Isles  Jerome, Baie Louis and Baie Hortense (after Josephine's daughter).  Outside the Terre Napoleon region, on the north coast, the name Golfe  Joseph Bonaparte bespoke geographical immortality for another member of  the family. But we miss Rousseau and Turgot, deplore the absence of  Corneille and La Bruyere, and feel that at least a sand-bank or two might  have been found for Quesnay and the economists, if only as a set-off  against the disparagement of Burke.    Yet it is on the whole an illustrious company, representative of the best  and brightest in French intellect and character. When the brave old  Spanish navigators of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries discovered  a new port or cape, they commonly gave it the name of the saint on whose  day in the calendar it was found; and the map of Central and South  America is a memorial at once of their piety and their enterprise. But  Baudin's expedition having no such guide--Comte's Positivist Calendar, if  not of later date, would have been useful--their selection of names was  quite an original effort. Unfortunately, the \"discoveries\" to which the  names were applied were not original.    Two facts are incontrovertible: (1) that Flinders had discovered and  charted the whole of the south coast of Australia from Fowler Bay to  Encounter Bay--except the south of Kangaroo Island, which is represented  by a dotted line on his charts--before he met Le Geographe on April 8,  1802; and (2) that the French officers knew that he had done so. Flinders  explained to Baudin the discoveries which he had made when they met in  Encounter Bay, and afterwards when the Investigator and the French ships  lay together in Port Jackson he showed him one of his finished charts to  illustrate what he had done. \"So far from any prior title being set up at  that time to Kangaroo Island and the parts westward,\" wrote Flinders,  \"the officers of the Geographe always spoke of them as belonging to the  Investigator.\"    The French names would appear to have been applied by Baudin, if  Freycinet is to be believed; for he uses the phrase \"les nommes que  Baudin a donnes.\"* (* Voyage de Decouvertes 2 Preface page 23.) But when  Freycinet wrote those words Baudin was dead, and the publication of the  charts had evoked much indignation on account of the gross wrong done to  Flinders. In one or two cases the names were certainly not Baudin's, as  will be made clear in a later chapter.* (* Take, for instance, Ile  Decres, the name given to Kangaroo Island. Decres did not become Minister  for the Navy till October 3, 1801. Baudin was then at sea, and probably  never knew anything about Decres' accession to office. It is pretty well  certain that the name was not given to the island until after the return  of the expedition, when Baudin was dead.) Certainly Baudin was in no  sense responsible for the publication. Peron and Freycinet were the men  who put their names to the charts and volumes; and they were by no means  exculpated by the suggestion that Baudin devised a nomenclature  calculated to deprive Flinders of the credit that he had won. Both Peron  and Freycinet knew, too, when they issued their volume and atlas, that  Flinders was being held in captivity in Mauritius; and the dead captain  was certainly not guilty of the meanness and mendacity of hurrying  forward the issue of books that pretended to discoveries never made,  while the real discoverer was prevented from asserting his own rightful  claims.    That the publication was hurried forward as soon as Napoleon's government  gave the order to print, is evident from the incompleteness of the atlas  of 1807. It contained a table of charts--\"Tableau General des planches  qui composent l'atlas historique\"--which were not inserted in the book;  and in one of the four copies of this rare volume which the author has  been able to examine, the previous owner, or the bookseller from whom it  was purchased, collating the contents with the table, had pencilled in  the margin, \"All wanting,\" being under the impression that the copy was  imperfect. But the charts detailed in the table were not issued with the  book. They were not ready, and the table stands as an eloquent indicator  of the hurry in which the publication was performed. The first volume of  the Voyage de Decouvertes contains numerous marginal references to charts  not contained in the atlas issued with it. Readers of the book must have  been puzzled by these references,* (* As the present writer was when he  began to study the subject closely, and as the Quarterly reviewer was in  1810. He said: \"The atlas is of quarto size; it contains not a single  chart nor any sketch or plan of a coast, island, bay, or harbour, though  frequent references are made to such in the margin of the printed volume\"  (page 60). The reviewer should have said, \"except the two cartes  generales\" described on a previous page.) when they turned to the atlas  and found no charts corresponding with them. Freycinet's complete folio  volume of charts was not published till 1812, five years after the issue  of the book which they were necessary to explain. Flinders had then been  released; but it is significant that he was held in the clutches of  General Decaen, despite constant demands for his liberation, until the  preparation of the French charts was sufficiently advanced to make it  impossible for his own to be issued until theirs had been placed before  the world.    Flinders, generous in his judgments of other men even when smarting under  great grievances, put forth an excuse for Peron, suggesting that he had  acted under pressure. \"How, then, came M. Peron to advance what was so  contrary to truth?\" he wrote. \"Was he a man destitute of all principle?  My answer is, that I believe his candour to have been equal to his  acknowledged abilities, and that what he wrote was from overruling  authority, and smote him to the heart. He did not live to finish the  second volume.\"    This would be an acceptable way of disposing of the question if we could  reasonably accept the explanation. But can we? Freycinet denied that any  pressure was exerted. Those who knew Peron's character, he wrote,* (*  Voyage de Decouvertes 2 page 21.) were aware that he would have refused  to do anything with which his conscience could reproach him. He was so  able and zealous a man of science, that we should like to believe that of  him. justice demands that we should give full weight to every favourable  factor in the case as affecting him. Flinders was a British naval  officer, and"]]]
