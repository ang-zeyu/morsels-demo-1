And at last, when they were  folding Helen away lovingly in flowers, from all who had loved her, Mrs.  Fisher wrote in despair to Polly, telling her all about it, and adding,  \"You must come home, if only for a few days, or Phronsie will be sick.\"    \"I shall go, too,\" declared old Mr. King, \"for Marian can spare me now.  Oh, that blessed child! And I can come back here with you, Polly, if  necessary.\"    And Polly had nothing for it but to help him off, and Charlotte's father  being ever so much better, she joined them; and as soon as it was a  possible thing, there they were at home, and Thomas was driving them up  at his best speed, to the carriage porch.    \"Polly!\" Phronsie gasped the word, and threw hungry little arms around  Polly's neck.    \"There, there, Pet,\" cried Polly cheerily, \"you see we're all home.  Here's Grandpapa!\"    \"Where's my girl?\" cried old Mr. King hastily. \"Here, Phronsie,\" and she  was in his arms, while the tears rained down her cheeks.    \"Bless me!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, putting up his hand at the  shower. \"Well, that is a welcome home, Phronsie.\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa, I didn't mean to!\" said Phronsie, drawing back in  dismay. \"I do hope it hasn't hurt your coat.\"    \"Never mind the coat, Phronsie,\" said Mr. King. \"So you are glad to get  us home, eh?\"    Phronsie snuggled close to his side, while she clung to his hand without  a word.    \"Well, we mustn't forget Charlotte,\" cried Polly, darting back to a tall  girl with light hair and very pale blue eyes, standing composedly in one  corner of the hall, and watching the whole thing closely. \"Mamsie, dear,  here she is,\" taking her hand to draw her to Mrs. Fisher.    \"Don't mind me,\" said Charlotte, perfectly at her ease. \"You take care  of the little girl,\" as Polly dragged her on.    Mrs. Fisher took a good long look at Charlotte Chatterton. Then she  smiled, \"I am glad to see you, Charlotte.\"    [Illustration: CHARLOTTE, STANDING COMPOSEDLY IN ONE CORNER OF THE  HALL.]    Charlotte took the firm fingers extended to her, and said, \"Thank you,\"  then turned off to look at Phronsie again.    And it wasn't till after dinner that Phronsie's trouble was touched  upon. Then Polly drew her off to a quiet corner.    \"Now, then, Phronsie,\" she said, gathering her up close in her arms,  \"tell me all about it, Pet. Just think,\" and Polly set warm kisses on  the pale little cheek, \"how long it is since you and I have had a good  talk.\"    \"I know it,\" said Phronsie wearily, and she drew a long sigh.    \"Isn't it good that dear Aunty is so much better?\" cried Polly cheerily,  quite at a loss how to begin.    \"Yes, Polly,\" said Phronsie, but she sighed again, and did not lift her  eyes to Polly's face.    \"If anything troubles you,\" at last broke out Polly desperately, \"you'd  feel better, Phronsie, to tell sister about it. I may not know how to  say the right things, but I can maybe help a little.\"    Phronsie sat quite still, and folded and unfolded her hands in her lap.  \"Why did God take away Helen?\" she asked suddenly, lifting her head.  \"Oh, Polly, it wasn't nice of him,\" she added, a strange look coming  into her brown eyes.    [Illustration: PHRONSIE WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW.]    \"Oh, Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly, quite shocked, \"don't, dear; that isn't  like you, Pet. Why, God made us all, and he can do just as he likes,  darling.\"    \"But it isn't nice,\" repeated Phronsie deliberately, and quite firmly,  \"to take Helen now. Why doesn't He make another little girl then for  Mrs. Fargo?\" and she held Polly with her troubled eyes.    \"Phronsie\"--cried Polly; then she stopped abruptly. \"Oh, what can I say?  I don't know, dearie; it's just this way; we don't know why God does  things. But we love him, and we feel it's right. Oh, Phronsie, don't  look so. There, there,\" and she drew her close to her, in a loving,  hungry clasp. \"I told you I didn't think I could say the right things to  you,\" she went on hurriedly, \"but, Phronsie, I know God did just right  in taking Helen to heaven. Just think how beautiful it must be there,  and so many little children are there. And Helen is so happy. Oh,  Phronsie, when I think of that, I am glad she is gone.\"    \"Helen was happy here,\" said Phronsie decidedly. \"And she never--never  would want to leave her mother alone, to go off to a nicer place. Never,  Polly.\"    Polly drew a long breath, and shut her lips. \"But, Phronsie, don't you  see,\" she cried presently, \"it may be that Mrs. Fargo wouldn't ever want  to go to Heaven unless Helen was there to meet her? It may be, Phronsie;  and that would be very dreadful, you know. And God loved Mrs. Fargo so  that he took Helen, and he is going to keep her happy every single  minute while she is waiting and getting ready for her mother.\"    Phronsie suddenly slipped down from Polly's lap. \"Is that true?\" she  demanded.    \"Yes, dear,\" said Polly, \"I think it is, Phronsie,\" and her cheeks  glowed. \"Oh, can't you see how much nicer it is in God to make Mrs.  Fargo happy for always with Helen, instead of just a little bit of a  while down here?\"    Phronsie went over to the window and looked up at the winter sky. \"It is  a long way off,\" she said, but the bitter tone had gone, and it was a  grieved little voice that added, \"and Mrs. Fargo can't see Helen.\"    \"Phronsie,\" said Polly, hurrying over to her side, \"perhaps God wants  you to do some things for Mrs. Fargo--things, I mean, that Helen would  have done.\"    \"Why, I can't go over there,\" said Phronsie wonderingly. \"Papa Fisher  says I am not to go over there for ever and ever so long, Polly.\"    \"Well, you can write her little notes and you can help her to see that  God did just right in taking Helen away,\" said Polly; \"and that would be  the very best thing you could do, Phronsie, for Mrs. Fargo; the very  loveliest thing in all this world.\"    \"Would it?\" asked Phronsie.    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"Then I'll do it; and perhaps God wants me to like Heaven better; does  he, Polly, do you think?\"    \"I really and truly do, Phronsie,\" said Polly softly. Then she leaned  over and threw both arms around Phronsie's neck. \"Oh, Phronsie, can't  you see--I never thought of it till now--but He has given you somebody  else instead of Helen, to love and to do things for?\"    Phronsie looked up wonderingly. \"I don't know what you mean, Polly,\" she  said.    \"There's Charlotte,\" cried Polly, going on rapidly as she released  Phronsie. \"Oh, Phronsie, you can't think; it's been dreadfully hard and  dull always for her at home, with those two stiff great-aunts pecking at  her.\"    \"Tell me about it,\" begged Phronsie, turning away from the window, and  putting her hand in Polly's.    \"Well, come over to our corner then.\" So the two ran back, Phronsie  climbing into Polly's lap, while a look of contentment began to spread  over her face.    \"You see,\" began Polly, \"Charlotte's mother has always been too ill to  have nice times; she couldn't go out, you know, very much, nor keep the  house, and so the two great-aunts came to live with them. Well, pretty  soon they began to feel as if they owned the house, and Charlotte, and  everybody in it.\"    \"Oh dear!\" exclaimed Phronsie, in distress.    \"And Charlotte's father, Mr. Alexander Chatterton, couldn't stop it; and  beside, he was away on business most of the time, and Charlotte didn't  complain--oh, she behaved very nice about it; Phronsie, her father told  Grandpapa all about it; and by and by her mother died, and then things  got worse and worse; but Mr. Chatterton never knew half how bad it was.  But when he was sick it all came out, and it worried him so that he got  very bad indeed, and then he sent for Grandpapa--Charlotte couldn't stop  him; he made her go. You see he was afraid he was going to die, and he  couldn't bear to have things so very dreadful for Charlotte.\"    \"And is he going to die?\" broke in Phronsie excitedly.    \"Oh no, indeed! he was almost well when we came away; it was only his  worrying over Charlotte that made him so bad. Oh, you ought to have seen  him, Phronsie, when Grandpapa offered to take Charlotte home with us for  the winter. He was so happy he almost cried.\"    \"I am so glad he was happy,\" cried Phronsie in great satisfaction, her  cheeks flushing.    \"And so now I think God gave Charlotte to you for a little while because  you haven't Helen. I do, Phronsie, and you can make Charlotte glad while  she is here, and help her to have a good time.\"    \"Can I?\" cried Phronsie, her cheeks growing a deep pink. \"Oh, Polly,  how? Charlotte is a big girl; how can I help her?\"    \"That's your secret to find out,\" said Polly merrily. \"Well, come now,\"  kissing her, \"we must hurry back to Grandpapa, or he'll feel badly to  have you gone so long.\"    \"Polly,\" cried Phronsie, as they hurried over the stairs, \"put your ear  down, do.\"    \"I can't till we get downstairs,\" laughed Polly, \"or I'll tumble on my  nose, I'm afraid. Well, here we are. Now then, what is it?\" and she bent  over to catch the soft words.    \"I'm sorry,\" said Phronsie, her lips quite close to Polly's rosy cheek,  \"that I said God wasn't nice to take Helen away. Oh, I love him, Polly,  I truly do.\"    \"So you do,\" said Polly, with, a warm clasp. \"Well, here's Grandpapa,\"  as the library door opened, and Mr. King came out to meet them.    Polly, running over the stairs the next day to greet Alexia and some of  the girls who were determined to make the most of her little visit at  home, was met first by one of the maids with a letter.    [Illustration: ALEXIA COOLLY READ ON, ONE ARM AROUND POLLY.]    \"Oh, now,\" cried Alexia, catching sight of it, \"I almost know that's to  hurry you back, Polly. She sha'n't read it, girls.\" With that she made a  feint of seizing the large white envelope.    \"Hands off from my property,\" cried Polly merrily, waving her off, and  sitting down on the stair she tore the letter open.

Service._          BOLIVIA    Bolivia, having no sea-coast, has been termed the Hermit Republic of  South America. Its territory is over 600,000 square miles in extent,  and within its bounds Nature displays almost every possible panorama,  and all climates. There are burning plains, the home of the emu,  armadillos, and ants; sandy deserts, where the wind drifts the sand  like snow, piling it up in ever-shifting hills about thirty feet in  height. Bolivia, shut in geographically and politically, is a world in  itself--a world of variety, in scenery, climate, products and people.  Its capital city, La Paz, has a population of 70,000, but the vast  interior is almost uninhabited. In the number of inhabitants to the  square mile, Bolivia ranks the lowest of all the nations of the earth.    Perhaps no country of the world has been, and is, so rich in precious  metals as Bolivia. \"The mines of Potosi alone have furnished the world  over $1,500,000,000 worth of silver since the Spaniards first took  possession of them.\" [Footnote: \"Protestant Missions in South America.\"]    Bolivia can lay claim to the most wonderful body of water in the  world--Lake Titicaca. This lake, nearly two and a half miles high in  the air, is literally in the clouds. \"Its lonely waters have no outlet  to the sea, but are guarded on their southern shores by gigantic ruins  of a prehistoric empire--palaces, temples, and fortresses--silent,  mysterious monuments of a long-lost golden age.\" Some of the largest  and most remarkable ruins of the world are found on the shores of Lake  Titicaca, and as this was the centre of the great Incan Dynasty, that  remarkable people have also left wonderful remains, to build which  stones thirty-eight feet long, eighteen feet wide, and six feet thick,  were quarried, carried and elevated. The Temple of the Sun. the most  sacred edifice of the Incas, was one of the richest buildings the sun  has ever shone upon, and it was itself a mine of wealth. From this one  temple, Pizarro, the Spanish conqueror, took 24,000 pounds of gold and  82,000 pounds of silver. \"Ninety million dollars' worth of precious  metals was torn from Inca temples alone.\" The old monarch of the  country, Atahuallpa, gave Pizarro twenty-two million dollars in gold to  buy back his country and his liberty from the Spaniards, but their  first act on receiving the vast ransom was to march him after a  crucifix at the head of a procession, and, because he refused to become  a Roman Catholic, put him to death. Perhaps never in the world's  history was there a baser act of perfidy, but this was urged by the  soldier-priest of the conquerors, Father Valverde, who himself signed  the King's death-warrant. This priest was afterwards made Bishop of  Atahuallpa's capital.    Surely no country of the world has had a darker or a sadder history  than this land of the Incas. The Spaniards arrived when the \"Children  of the Sun\" were at the height of their prosperity. \"The affair of  reducing the country was committed to the hands of irresponsible  individuals, soldiers of fortune, desperate adventurers who entered on  conquest as a game which they had to play in the most unscrupulous  manner, with little care but to win it. The lands, and the persons as  well, of the conquered races were parcelled out and appropriated by the  victors as the legitimate spoils of victory. Every day outrages were  perpetrated, at the contemplation of which humanity shudders. They  suffered the provident arrangements of the Incas to fall into decay.  The poor Indian, without food, now wandered half-starved and naked over  the plateau. Even those who aided the Spaniards fared no better, and  many an Inca noble roamed a mendicant over the fields where he once  held rule; and if driven, perchance, by his necessities to purloin  something from the superfluity of his conquerors, he expiated it by a  miserable death.\"  [Footnote: Prescott's \"Conquest of Peru.\"]    Charles Kingsley says there were \"cruelties and miseries unexampled in  the history of Christendom, or perhaps on earth, save in the conquests  of Sennacherib and Zinghis-Khan.\" Millions perished at the forced labor  of the mines, The Incan Empire had, it is calculated, a population of  twenty millions at the arrival of the Spaniards, In two centuries the  population fell to four millions.    When the groans of these beasts of burden reached the ears of the good  (?) Queen Isabel of Spain, she enacted a law that throughout her new  dominions no Indian, man or woman, should be compelled to carry more  than three hundred pounds' weight at one load! Is it cause for wonder  that the poor, down-trodden natives, seeing the flaunting flag of  Spain, with its stripe of yellow between stripes of red, should regard  it as representing a river of gold between two rivers of blood?    \"Not infrequently,\" said a reliable witness, \"I have seen the  Spaniards, long after the Conquest, amuse themselves by hunting down  the natives with blood hounds, for mere sport, or in order to train  their dogs to the game. The most unbounded scope was given to  licentiousness. The young maiden was torn remorselessly from the arms  of her family to gratify the passion of her brutal conqueror. The  sacred houses of the Virgins of the Sun were broken open and violated,  and the cavalier swelled his harem with a troop of Indian girls, making  it seem that the crescent would have been a more fitting emblem for his  banner than the immaculate cross.\"    With the inexorable conqueror came the more inexorable priest.  \"Attendance at Roman Catholic worship was made compulsory. Men and  women with small children were compelled to journey as much as  thirty-six miles to attend mass. Absentees were punished, therefore the  Indian feared to disobey.\" [Footnote: Neely, \"Spanish America.\"]    As is well known, the ancient inhabitants worshipped the sun and the  moon. The Spanish priest, in order to gain proselytes with greater  facility, did not forbid this worship, but placed the crucifix between  the two. Where the Inca suns and moons were of solid gold and silver,  they were soon replaced by painted wooden ones. The crucifix, with sun  and moon images on each side, is common all over Bolivia to-day.    Now, four hundred years later, see the Indian under priestly rule. The  following is taken from an official report of the Governor of  Chimborazo: \"The religious festivals that the Indians celebrate--not of  their own will, but by the inexorable will of the priest--are, through  the manner in which they are kept, worse than those described to us of  the times of Paganism, and of monstrous consequences to morality and  the national welfare ... they may be reckoned as a barbarous mixture of  idolatry and superstition, sustained by infamous avarice. The Indian  who is chosen to make a feast either has to use up in it his little  savings, leaving his family submerged in misery, or he has to rob in  order to invest the products of his crime in paying the fees to the  priest and for church ceremonies. These are simply brutal orgies that  last many days, with a numerous attendance, and in which all manner of  crimes and vices have free license.\"    \"For the idols of the aborigines were substituted the images of the  Virgin Mary and the Roman saints. The Indians gave up their old idols,  but they went on with their image-worship. Image-worship is idolatry,  whether in India, Africa, or anywhere else, and the worship of Roman  images is essentially idolatry as much as the worship of any other kind  of images. Romanism substituted for one set of idols another set. So  the Indians who were idolaters continued to be idolaters, only the new  idols had other names and, possibly, were a little better-looking.\"  [Footnote: Neely, \"South America.\"]    What has Romanism done for the Indians of Bolivia in its four hundred  years of rule? Compare the people of that peaceful, law-keeping dynasty  which the Spaniards found with the Bolivian Indian of to-day! Now the  traveller can report: \"The Indians are killing the whites wherever they  find them, and practising great cruelties, having bored holes in the  heads of their victims and sucked the brains out while they were yet  alive. Sixteen whites are said to have been killed in this way! These  same Indians are those who have been Christianized by the Roman priests  for the past three centuries, but such cruelties as they have been  practising show that as yet not a ray of Christ's love has entered  their darkened minds.\" How can the priest teach what he is himself  ignorant of?    Where the Indian has been civilized, as well as Romanized, Mr. Milne,  of the American Bible Society, could write:    \"Since the Spanish conquest the progress of the Indians has been in the  line of deterioration and moral degradation. They are oppressed by the  Romish clergy, who can never drain contributions enough out of them,  and who make the children render service to pay for masses for deceased  parents and relatives. Tears came to our eyes as Mr. Penzotti and I  watched them practising their heathen rites in the streets of La Paz,  the chief city of Bolivia. They differ from the other Indians in that  they are domesticated, but _they know no more of the Gospel than they  did under the rule of the Incas.\"_    What is to be the future of these natives? Shall they disappear from  the stage of the world's history like so many other aborigines, victims  of civilization, or will a hand yet be stretched out to help them?  Civilization, after all, is not entirely made up of greed and lust, but  in it there is righteousness and truth. May the day soon dawn when some  of the latter may be extended to them ere they take the long, dark  trail after their fathers, and have hurled the last malediction at  their cursed white oppressors!      \"We suffer yet a little space     Until we pass away,"]]]
