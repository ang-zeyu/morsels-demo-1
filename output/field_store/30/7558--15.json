Again, it is of cobalt blue, with changing bands of purple and gleaming  pink, or of grey blue--the reflection of a sky pallid and tremulous with  excess of light. Or myriad hosts of microscopic creatures--the Red Sea  owes to the tribe its name--the multitudinous sea dully incarnadine; or  the boat rides buoyantly on the shoulders of Neptune's white horses, while  funnel-shaped water spouts sway this way and that. Land is always near,  and the flotsam and jetsam, do they not supply that smack of  excitement--if not the boisterous hope--bereft of which life might seem  \"always afternoon?\"    These chronicles are toned from first to last by perceptions which came  to the Beachcomber--perceptions which lead, mayhap, to a subdued and sober  estimate of the purpose and bearing of the pilgrimage of life. Doubts  become exalted and glorified, hopes all rapture, when long serene days  are spent alone in the contemplation of the splendours of sky and sea,  and the enchantment of tropic shores.    TROPICAL INDUSTRIES    Was there not an explicit contract that some of the experiences and  events of a settler's life should be duly described and recorded? How to  fulfil that obligation and at the same time avoid what is ordinarily  regarded as the dull and prosaic, the stale, the flat, the unprofitable,  is the trouble. I would gladly shirk even this small responsibility, even  as greater ones have been outmanoeuvred, but a written promise  unfulfilled may be troublesome to a conscience, which, when reminiscent  of ante-beachcombing days, is not altogether unimpressionable.    Well, the life of a settler--the man who drags his sustenance, all and  every part of it, from the soil in tropical Queensland, as a mere settler  very closely resembles that of others who cultivate. If an abstract of  the universal experience were obtainable, it would very likely be found  to go towards the establishment of a standard from which many would  cheerfully desire many cheerful changes. After all, that represents a  condition not altogether monopolised by settlers.    Yet, when once the life is begun, how few there are who attempt to  withdraw from it? It grows on the senses and faculties. It appeals to the  emotional as well as to the stolid humours. The cares of this world as  expounded in town life, and the sinfulness of never-to-be-acquired riches  are foreign to the free, bland air which has filtered through the myriad  leaves of the mountain, and which smacks so strongly of freedom.  Sometimes the settler takes up studies and relieves the sameness of his  duties by pastimes. One never went to his maize field, along narrow  gloomy aisles through the jungle, without a net for the capture of  butterflies. His humble home was as resplendent as the show-cases of a  natural history museum. But he was singularly favoured. A lovely  waterfall was the jewel on his estate. That was the shape of beauty that  moved away the pall from his dark spirit and gave colour to his life and  actions. Another took to collecting birds' eggs; another to the study of  botany; another to photography. Each wreathed, according to his  predilections, a flowery band to bind him to the earth, finding that even  the life of a settler may be filled with \"sweet dreams, and health and  quiet.\" But the great majority seem to have taken to the scrap heap of  Federal politics with such ardour that they clutch but the fag ends of  the poetry of life.    Many become great readers and are knowing and knowledgeable. Those who  drift away from country life are for the most part men who hustle after  the coy damsel fortune by searching for minerals, and just as many who  have succeeded in that arduous passion settle quietly on the land. Each  may and does desire amendments to and amelioration in his lot. There is  still left to all the healthy impulse of achievement, the desire for  something better, the noble and inspiriting virtue of discontent.    Rare is a deserted home. Even the first rough dwelling of a settler  possessing the slenderest resources is invested with tender sentiments.  There is his home--a poor one, perhaps, but his own, and to it he clings  with desperation, sees in and about it attractions and beauty where  others perceive nothing but untoned dreariness, unrelieved hopelessness.  His little bit of country may be remote and isolated, but Nature is warm  and encouraging, and profuse of her stimulants here. She responds  off-hand without pausing to reflect, but with an outburst of goodwill and  purpose to appeals for sustenance. She has no despondent moods. She never  lapses in prolific purposes. She may be wayward in accepting the  interferences of man, but all her vigorous impulses are expended in  productiveness. She cannot sulk or idle. Kill, burn and destroy her  primeval jungle, and she does not give way to sadness and despair, nor  are any of her infinite forces abated. Spontaneously she begins the work  of restoration, and as if by  magic the scar is covered with as rich and  riotous a profusion of vegetation as ever. Nature needs only to be  restrained and schooled and her response is an abundance of various sorts  of food for man.    The routine that cultivators of the soil have to obey is diverse, but the  life of the dweller in the country in tropical Queensland can be asserted  with perfect safety to be more comfortable than that of the average  settler in any other part of Australia. There are no phases of  agricultural enterprise devoid of toil, save perhaps the growing of  vanilla, the very poetry of the oldest of pursuits, in which one has to  aid and abet in the loves and in the marriage of flowers. But vanilla  production is not one of the profitable branches of agriculture here yet.  We have to deal only with things that are at present practicable.    Whether the settler grows maize, or fruit or coffee, or as a collateral  exercise of industry gets log timber, or raises pigs or poultry, the life  has no great variations. If he farms sugar-cane, being resident within the  zone of influence of a mill, he belongs to a different order--an order  with which it is not intended to deal. My purpose refers only to men who  do not employ labour, who have to depend almost solely upon their own hard  hands. The conditions upon which the land is acquired demand personal  residence during a period of five years and the erection of permanent  improvements, such as fencing, thereon, and there are not many who take  up a selection who are in the position to pay wages. The selector must do  the clearing, and the preparation of the soil for whatever crop in his  experience or the experience of others is considered the most  remunerative. During this period his love for the particular piece of  land by-and-by to become his own begins. More realistically than anyone  else he knows the quantity of his energy and enthusiasm, his very life,  the land has absorbed. It becomes part of himself even in the early days  of toil, and though when in the fulness of time and the completion of  conditions he may lease the land to Chinese cultivators, and become a  resident landlord, he cannot leave the place even for the attraction of  town life, for possibly the rent he receives does not make him  independent quite. At any rate he lives on the land. The alien race does  the hard work, and takes the greater portion of profit; but he enjoys the  luxury of possession, and must make sacrifices accordingly.    I am fearful of entering upon a description of the cultivation of maize,  or bananas, or citrus fruits, or pineapples, or mangoes, or coffee, or  even sweet potatoes, because experience teaches me that others know of  all the details in a far more practical sense.    Would it not be presumptuous for a mere idler, an individual whose  enterprise and industry have been sapped by the insidious nonchalance of  the Beachcomber, to tell of practical details of cultural pursuits--the  enthusiasm, the disappointments, the glowing anticipations, the  realisation of inflexible facts, the plain emphatic truths which others  have reason to know ever so much more keenly?    But it may be forgiven if I generalise and say that the minor departments  of rural enterprise in North Queensland are in a peculiar stage--a stage  of transition and uncertainty. Coloured labour has been depended upon to  a large extent. Even the poorest settler has had the aid of aboriginals.  But with the passing of that race, and prohibition against the employment  of any sort of coloured labour, the question is to be asked, Can tropical  products be grown profitably unless consumers are willing to pay a  largely increased price--a price equivalent to the difference between the  earnings of those who toil in other tropical countries and the living  wage of a white man in Australia?    Fruit of many acceptable varieties can be grown to perfection with little  labour in immense quantities. Coffee is one of the most prolific of  crops. Timber is obtainable in magnificent assortment and unrealisable  quantities. Poultry and pigs multiply extraordinarily. Apart from bananas  the fruit trade is shifty and treacherous. The markets are far away and  inconstant, the means of transport not yet perfect. Many assert that not  half the pine-apples and oranges, and not one-hundredth part of the  mangoes produced in North Queensland are consumed. That the quantity  grown is trivial in comparison with what would be, were the demand  regular and consistent, is self-evident. We want population to eat our  produce, and then there will be no complaint.    In the case of coffee a plentiful supply of cheap labour is essential to  success. Those who by judicious treatment of the aboriginals command  their services have so far made profit. A coffee plantation suggests  pleasant, picturesque and spicy things.

Approach it not!\" continued she, observing  with terror that Giovanni was drawing nearer to the shrub. \"It has  qualities that you little dream of. But I, dearest Giovanni,--I grew up  and blossomed with the plant and was nourished with its breath. It was  my sister, and I loved it with a human affection; for, alas!--hast thou  not suspected it?--there was an awful doom.\"    Here Giovanni frowned so darkly upon her that Beatrice paused and  trembled. But her faith in his tenderness reassured her, and made her  blush that she had doubted for an instant.    \"There was an awful doom,\" she continued, \"the effect of my father's  fatal love of science, which estranged me from all society of my kind.  Until Heaven sent thee, dearest Giovanni, oh, how lonely was thy poor  Beatrice!\"    \"Was it a hard doom?\" asked Giovanni, fixing his eyes upon her.    \"Only of late have I known how hard it was,\" answered she, tenderly.  \"Oh, yes; but my heart was torpid, and therefore quiet.\"    Giovanni's rage broke forth from his sullen gloom like a lightning  flash out of a dark cloud.    \"Accursed one!\" cried he, with venomous scorn and anger. \"And, finding  thy solitude wearisome, thou hast severed me likewise from all the  warmth of life and enticed me into thy region of unspeakable horror!\"    \"Giovanni!\" exclaimed Beatrice, turning her large bright eyes upon his  face. The force of his words had not found its way into her mind; she  was merely thunderstruck.    \"Yes, poisonous thing!\" repeated Giovanni, beside himself with passion.  \"Thou hast done it! Thou hast blasted me! Thou hast filled my veins  with poison! Thou hast made me as hateful, as ugly, as loathsome and  deadly a creature as thyself--a world's wonder of hideous monstrosity!  Now, if our breath be happily as fatal to ourselves as to all others,  let us join our lips in one kiss of unutterable hatred, and so die!\"    \"What has befallen me?\" murmured Beatrice, with a low moan out of her  heart. \"Holy Virgin, pity me, a poor heart-broken child!\"    \"Thou,--dost thou pray?\" cried Giovanni, still with the same fiendish  scorn. \"Thy very prayers, as they come from thy lips, taint the  atmosphere with death. Yes, yes; let us pray! Let us to church and dip  our fingers in the holy water at the portal! They that come after us  will perish as by a pestilence! Let us sign crosses in the air! It will  be scattering curses abroad in the likeness of holy symbols!\"    \"Giovanni,\" said Beatrice, calmly, for her grief was beyond passion,  \"why dost thou join thyself with me thus in those terrible words? I, it  is true, am the horrible thing thou namest me. But thou,--what hast  thou to do, save with one other shudder at my hideous misery to go  forth out of the garden and mingle with thy race, and forget there ever  crawled on earth such a monster as poor Beatrice?\"    \"Dost thou pretend ignorance?\" asked Giovanni, scowling upon her.  \"Behold! this power have I gained from the pure daughter of Rappaccini.\"    There was a swarm of summer insects flitting through the air in search  of the food promised by the flower odors of the fatal garden. They  circled round Giovanni's head, and were evidently attracted towards him  by the same influence which had drawn them for an instant within the  sphere of several of the shrubs. He sent forth a breath among them, and  smiled bitterly at Beatrice as at least a score of the insects fell  dead upon the ground.    \"I see it! I see it!\" shrieked Beatrice. \"It is my father's fatal  science! No, no, Giovanni; it was not I! Never! never! I dreamed only  to love thee and be with thee a little time, and so to let thee pass  away, leaving but thine image in mine heart; for, Giovanni, believe it,  though my body be nourished with poison, my spirit is God's creature,  and craves love as its daily food. But my father,--he has united us in  this fearful sympathy. Yes; spurn me, tread upon me, kill me! Oh, what  is death after such words as thine? But it was not I. Not for a world  of bliss would I have done it.\"    Giovanni's passion had exhausted itself in its outburst from his lips.  There now came across him a sense, mournful, and not without  tenderness, of the intimate and peculiar relationship between Beatrice  and himself. They stood, as it were, in an utter solitude, which would  be made none the less solitary by the densest throng of human life.  Ought not, then, the desert of humanity around them to press this  insulated pair closer together? If they should be cruel to one another,  who was there to be kind to them? Besides, thought Giovanni, might  there not still be a hope of his returning within the limits of  ordinary nature, and leading Beatrice, the redeemed Beatrice, by the  hand? O, weak, and selfish, and unworthy spirit, that could dream of an  earthly union and earthly happiness as possible, after such deep love  had been so bitterly wronged as was Beatrice's love by Giovanni's  blighting words! No, no; there could be no such hope. She must pass  heavily, with that broken heart, across the borders of Time--she must  bathe her hurts in some fount of paradise, and forget her grief in the  light of immortality, and THERE be well.    But Giovanni did not know it.    \"Dear Beatrice,\" said he, approaching her, while she shrank away as  always at his approach, but now with a different impulse, \"dearest  Beatrice, our fate is not yet so desperate. Behold! there is a  medicine, potent, as a wise physician has assured me, and almost divine  in its efficacy. It is composed of ingredients the most opposite to  those by which thy awful father has brought this calamity upon thee and  me. It is distilled of blessed herbs. Shall we not quaff it together,  and thus be purified from evil?\"    \"Give it me!\" said Beatrice, extending her hand to receive the little  silver vial which Giovanni took from his bosom. She added, with a  peculiar emphasis, \"I will drink; but do thou await the result.\"    She put Baglioni's antidote to her lips; and, at the same moment, the  figure of Rappaccini emerged from the portal and came slowly towards  the marble fountain. As he drew near, the pale man of science seemed to  gaze with a triumphant expression at the beautiful youth and maiden, as  might an artist who should spend his life in achieving a picture or a  group of statuary and finally be satisfied with his success. He paused;  his bent form grew erect with conscious power; he spread out his hands  over them in the attitude of a father imploring a blessing upon his  children; but those were the same hands that had thrown poison into the  stream of their lives. Giovanni trembled. Beatrice shuddered nervously,  and pressed her hand upon her heart.    \"My daughter,\" said Rappaccini, \"thou art no longer lonely in the  world. Pluck one of those precious gems from thy sister shrub and bid  thy bridegroom wear it in his bosom. It will not harm him now. My  science and the sympathy between thee and him have so wrought within  his system that he now stands apart from common men, as thou dost,  daughter of my pride and triumph, from ordinary women. Pass on, then,  through the world, most dear to one another and dreadful to all  besides!\"    \"My father,\" said Beatrice, feebly,--and still as she spoke she kept  her hand upon her heart,--\"wherefore didst thou inflict this miserable  doom upon thy child?\"    \"Miserable!\" exclaimed Rappaccini. \"What mean you, foolish girl? Dost  thou deem it misery to be endowed with marvellous gifts against which  no power nor strength could avail an enemy--misery, to be able to quell  the mightiest with a breath--misery, to be as terrible as thou art  beautiful? Wouldst thou, then, have preferred the condition of a weak  woman, exposed to all evil and capable of none?\"    \"I would fain have been loved, not feared,\" murmured Beatrice, sinking  down upon the ground. \"But now it matters not. I am going, father,  where the evil which thou hast striven to mingle with my being will  pass away like a dream-like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers,  which will no longer taint my breath among the flowers of Eden.  Farewell, Giovanni! Thy words of hatred are like lead within my heart;  but they, too, will fall away as I ascend. Oh, was there not, from the  first, more poison in thy nature than in mine?\"    To Beatrice,--so radically had her earthly part been wrought upon by  Rappaccini's skill,--as poison had been life, so the powerful antidote  was death; and thus the poor victim of man's ingenuity and of thwarted  nature, and of the fatality that attends all such efforts of perverted  wisdom, perished there, at the feet of her father and Giovanni. Just at  that moment Professor Pietro Baglioni looked forth from the window, and  called loudly, in a tone of triumph mixed with horror, to the  thunderstricken man of science, \"Rappaccini! Rappaccini! and is THIS  the upshot of your experiment!\"        MRS. BULLFROG    It makes me melancholy to see how like fools some very sensible people  act in the matter of choosing wives. They perplex their judgments by a  most undue attention to little niceties of personal appearance, habits,  disposition, and other trifles which concern nobody but the lady  herself. An unhappy gentleman, resolving to wed nothing short of  perfection, keeps his heart and hand till both get so old and withered  that no tolerable woman will accept them. Now this is the very height  of absurdity. A kind Providence has so skilfully adapted sex to sex and  the mass of individuals to each other, that, with certain obvious  exceptions, any male and female may be moderately happy in the married  state. The true rule is to ascertain that the match is fundamentally a  good one, and then to take it for granted that all minor objections,"]]]
