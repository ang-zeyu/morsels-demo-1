[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#14)"],[1," Passing by the persecutions inflicted upon the Christians by the  Jews--the whipping of Peter and John, under the order of the Jewish  Sanhedrim, the martyrdom of Stephen, the execution of Saint James,  the repeated mobbing and whippings of Paul--I call attention to the  first great pagan persecution under the cruel edict of the Emperor  Nero, in the second half of the first Christian century. The emperor  having set on fire the city of Rome in order that he might view a great  conflagration, and wishing to divert suspicion from himself, he first  accused and then tried to compel the Christians to confess the crime.  At this point I summon Tacitus, the renowned Roman annalist, to tell  the remainder of the story:    \"With this view he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men  who, under the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded  with deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ,  who, in the reign of Tiberius, had suffered death by the sentence of  the procurator Pontius Pilate. For awhile this dire superstition was  checked, but it again burst forth, and not only spread itself over  Judea, the first seat of this mischievous sect, but was even introduced  into Rome, the common asylum, which receives and protects whatever  is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessions of those that were  seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were  all convicted not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city,  as for their hatred of human kind. They died in torments, and their  torments were embittered by insults and derision. Some were nailed on  crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts and exposed to the  fury of dogs; others, again, smeared over with combustible materials,  were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night. The  gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle, which was  accompanied with a horse race, and honored with the {LV} presence of  the emperor, who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude  of a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the  most exemplary punishments, but the public abhorrence was changed  into commiseration from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were  sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a  jealous tyrant.\" [46]    This first great persecution of the Christians under the authority  of the Roman emperor, is sufficiently characteristic to describe the  other persecutions which were intermittingly perpetrated upon the  Christians through the two succeeding centuries. What seems to be the  most incongruous circumstance connected with these persecutions is,  that they occurred not only under such wretches as Nero and Domitian,  but under such virtuous emperors as Trajan, Adrian, Marcus Aurelius and  Diocletian. Intermittingly, then, through three troubled centuries, and  under circumstances of the utmost cruelty, persecution raged against  the Christians. As the highest authority on Roman history remarks: \"If  the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity, by a plague, a  famine, or an unsuccessful war; if the Tiber had, or the Nile had not  risen above its banks; if the earth had shaken, or if the temperate  order of the seasons had been interrupted, the superstitious pagans  were convinced that the crimes and impurities of the Christians, who  were spared by the excessive lenity of the government, had at length  provoked the divine justice.\" [47] And however virtuous the emperors  were, or however mild and equitable in character the governors of the  provinces, it is certain that they did not hesitate to appease the  rage of the people by sacrificing the obnoxious Christian victims. All  this at a time, too, when religious tolerance and in large measure  even religious freedom were enjoyed by those of all other religions  within the empire, and in fact we may say that the persecution of the  Christians was the only circumstance which broke in upon the religious  concord of the world. From the apologies of the early church fathers,  addressed to some of the emperors of the second and third centuries,  we find them making the most pathetic complaints to the effect, \"that  the Christians who obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty of  conscience, were alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire,  excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government.\"    Why was this? Surely it did not arise from any vicious principle  inherent in the Christian religion itself. \"If we seriously consider  the purity of the Christian religion,\" remarks Gibbon, in the  opening paragraph of his great treatise on the \"_Conduct of the  Roman Government Toward the Christians_,\" \"the sanctity of its moral  precepts, and the {LVI} innocence as well as the austere lives of  the greater number of those who, during the first ages, embraced the  faith of the gospel, we should naturally suppose that so benevolent  a doctrine would have been received with due reverence even by the  unbelieving world; that the learned and polite, however they might  deride the miracles, would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect;  and that the magistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected  an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws,  though they declined the active cares of war and government. If, on the  other hand, we recollect the universal tolerance of polytheism, as it  was invariably maintained by the faith of the people, the incredulity  of philosophers, and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors,  we are at a loss to discover what new offense the Christians had  committed, what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference  of antiquity, and what new motives could urge the Roman princes, who  beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in  peace under their gentle sway, to inflict a severe punishment upon any  part of their subjects who had chosen for themselves a singular but an  inoffensive mode of faith and worship.\" [48]    What, then, I again ask, was the cause of the singular departure from  the enlightened policy of the empire in granting religious toleration  and even large religious freedom to its subjects? I am sure that  modern Christians will scarcely be satisfied with the various causes  assigned for this strange conduct on the part of the Roman emperors  who persecuted the Christians. These causes, or at least the principal  ones, are conceded by both infidel and Christian authorities to be:    First, the Christians were a sect and not a nation, and were open to  the charge that they had deserted the faith of their forefathers, a  thing inexplicable to the Roman mind. It could be claimed on the part  of the Christians, of course, that this was not true; that so far were  they from deserting the faith of their fathers, that their present  Christian faith was but the complement of their fathers' faith, the  fulfillment alike of its prophecies and symbols--in a word, the gospel  was the fulfillment of the law. This, however, was a refinement of  explanation to which the haughty Romans could not be expected to give  attention.    Second, the Christians condemned and abhorred the public religion of  the state, so closely connected with the affairs of the government,  and hence they were judged to be enemies of the state, a circumstance  which made them objects of detestation to those intrusted with the  administration of the laws.    {LVII} Third, the Christians in their worship employed no images, nor  temples, nor incense, nor sacrifices; neither did they represent their  God by any corporeal figure or symbol, therefore they were adjudged to  be atheists, and accordingly detested.    Fourth, the gloom and austere aspect of the Christians, and their  thorough abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life,  their denunciation of war, together with their frequent predictions of  impending divine judgments, caused them to be regarded as the enemies  of mankind.    Fifth, the secrecy in which they conducted their religious services  (a policy first born of necessity, because of the fear of their  adversaries, and afterwards continued under the false notion that it  would render their sacred institutions more respectable) drew upon them  the suspicion that they only \"concealed what they would have blushed to  disclose;\" and this left them open to the misrepresentation and calumny  of their enemies, by which the fury of the multitude was aroused  against them.    Sixth, the severe simplicity of the Christian mode of worship,  employing as it did neither sacrifices nor an elaborate  priesthood--excited the animosity of the pagan priests and their  servitors, in exact proportion as the Christians became a menace  to their occupation; for it was painfully apparent to them that if  Christianity was successful there would be no need of the pagan  priesthood--its occupation would be gone.    All these alleged causes for the persecution of the Christians within  the Roman empire may be allowed, though some of them may be more  properly regarded as pretexts for, than causes of the persecution.  But back of all the assigned causes--which are at best but secondary  in their nature--one may see moving a force, the primary cause of the  persecution, of which the apprehensions of magistrates, the hatred of  the pagan priesthood, and the clamor of the multitude were but the  outward manifestations. That primary cause of the persecution of the  Christians is to be found in the bitter hatred of that dark spirit who  in heaven, before he fell from his high estate, was known under the  splendid appellation of \"The Light Bearer,\" \"Lucifer,\" \"Son of the  Morning,\" as high in favor as in station, before his sin of rebellion  against the Father-God. [49]    Beyond the mere fact that he impiously did rebel in heaven against  God, and that he was impelled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#14)"],[1," I would say, I am here because God has spoken,  and raised up a Prophet, through whom He has restored the fulness  of the everlasting Gospel, with all its gifts, powers, ordinances,  and blessings; with a proclamation to all peoples, \"_Repent, for the  kingdom of heaven is at hand_.\" In the providence of God, I have been  called as an ambassador, to bear this message to the nations of the  earth, which I realize devolves on me a great responsibility which I  cannot discharge without the aid of the Almighty.    And now, another question suggests itself--_How came I here_? In answer  to this, I can truly say, the hand of the Lord has led me, and His  power has protected and preserved me in the midst of those perilous  scenes to which voyagers are often exposed when on the briny deep in  their passage to foreign lands.    I was nearly two weeks on the way from Cleveland, Ohio, to New  York--traveled upwards of three hundred miles on the Erie canal. At  Albany I took steamboat to New York, and the next day, after having  supplied myself with what little necessary articles and comforts I  needed on the voyage, went on board a ship just ready to sail, bidding  good bye to New York, after a brief introduction and hasty glance at  its temptations for sight-seeing; and, for the first time, turned my  face from my native land.    I was forty-two days crossing the ocean, and during this time we  encountered three terrible storms--storms which those accustomed  to the ocean pronounced very dangerous. Unacquainted as I was with  the turbulent waves, I was unable to judge comparatively, but, in a  number of instances, to say the least of it, the scene was fearfully  terrific. I did not feel surprised that men, women and children who had  not learned to trust in God, wrung their hands in an agony of fear,  and wept. My trust was in Him who created the seas and defined their  bounds. I was on His errand--I knew that I was sent on this mission by  the authority He recognizes, and, although the elements raged and the  ship swayed and trembled amid the heaving billows, He was at the helm,  and my life was safe in His keeping.    I think, aunt, that you moved from Massachusetts to Ohio by land,  and that you have had no experience in ocean life; now, to realize  the answer to \"How came I here?\" Just look at me in your lively  imagination, in one of these terrific storms, seated on a large  hogshead of water--holding on, with both hands, to ropes near by,  in order to retain my position--the ship reeling and dashing from  side to side--now and then a monster wave leaping over the bulwarks,  treating all present with a shower bath--see, sitting near me, a man  weeping bitterly with terror in his countenance--the next moment a  wave shoots over the bulwarks, dashing him from his seat and landing  him precipitately against the bulwark on the opposite side, from which  he arises with a broken arm and dripping wet; while many others are  badly bruised by having been furiously thrown about. So much for the  upper deck. Now take a peep into the deck below, where boxes, chests  and barrels, having broken loose from their storage, are slipping and  tumbling about among the women and children, whose groans and cries  for help are in vain, so long as each man has all he can possibly do  to take care of himself, for none but sailors and those accustomed to  marine life can control their movements in a fierce storm on the mighty  deep. No doubt but an imaginative glance at the one storm will suffice.  Now, after the storm subsided and the bosom of the great deep settled  into calm repose, see the tall masts bow gently before the mildly  moving breeze--the white sails unfurl in placid swells, and again the  ship moves through the parting waves with stately pride, while joy and  gratitude fill every heart.    When we arrived at the Liverpool docks, as the vessel approached within  a few feet of the shore, the hand of an Englishman was reached forth  to assist me. I immediately seized it and landed upon the island of  Great Britain, just three months from the time I left my father's  house in Illinois, to which place my father and family had been driven  by the ruthless hand of mobocracy. The twenty-second of this month  I shall have been four months in England. The pleasure I realized  on the termination of a long and tedious voyage on the ocean cannot  be expressed. Suffice it to say, my heart was full of the highest  gratitude to Him who preserves and sustains those whom He calls and  sends forth as ministers of salvation to the nations of the earth.    In Liverpool, I found a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, with about one hundred members. I tarried a few days  and spoke in an evening meeting, then took the train to Manchester,  distant thirty miles. On my arrival, I experienced inexpressible joy in  greeting once more my brethren from America. I stopped in Manchester  about ten days, during which I preached a number of times and baptized  several persons. The population of this city consists of over three  hundred thousand inhabitants.    From Manchester I went by coach to Birmingham. There I labored in the  ministry about three months, and never enjoyed myself better, nor  received kinder treatment. This great city contains about two hundred  thousand inhabitants.    On the eleventh of February, in about five hours I proceeded by train  to London, from which I write you. I am here, presiding over the Church  in London; I also have charge of several branches established in the  vicinity. The work of the Lord moves on with rapidity in all parts of  Her Majesty's kingdom--in England, Scotland and Wales.    With kind regards to you, dear aunt, and to each member of your family,  I subscribe myself,    Your affectionate nephew,    L. Snow.        CHAPTER X.

He says the Church there now numbers sixteen, and that many more are  on the eve of being baptized. He also informs us that the Church at  Greet's Green now numbers about forty members, and that several in  that place will soon become citizens of the Kingdom of God. One of the  Methodist preachers has yielded obedience to the faith.--_Millennial  Star_.    February 14, 1841.--At a conference in London, it was moved by Heber C.  Kimball, seconded by Wilford Woodruff, that Lorenzo Snow be appointed  president of this conference; also to take the superintendency of the  Church in London. This appointment was confirmed on the 6th of April,  at the annual conference in Manchester. At that conference, nine of  the Quorum of the Twelve were present, viz: Brigham Young, Heber C.  Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Willard Richards,  Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor and George A. Smith.    The records show that after Brother Snow's return from conference up to  the 26th of May, he had baptized eighteen persons.    Before leaving Greet's Green to take charge of the Church in London,  Brother Lorenzo held several meetings in Wolverhampton, a flourishing  town numbering several thousand inhabitants. There he succeeded in  establishing a branch of the Church. A man, by name William Henshaw,  was one of the number who embraced the Gospel at that time; a man of  ability and force of character, he became very useful as a minister of  and advocate for the truth.    Brother Snow ordained William Henshaw to the Priesthood, and sent him  on a mission to Wales to introduce and open the Gospel door to that  people. He was very successful and greatly blessed in his labors. He  had baptized several hundred persons and organized quite a number of  branches of the Church in that country previous to the arrival of  Captain Dan Jones, who was sent as a missionary from Salt Lake to that  people.    It is a matter of deep regret that, after having performed a great and  good work--after having been instrumental in bringing into the Church,  among the many whom he baptized, several persons who became prominent  and influential preachers of the Gospel, that he should make shipwreck  of his faith through that destructive demon, intemperance, and by  intoxication destroy the powerful faculties with which God had endowed  him. He crossed the ocean, and, in St. Louis, died a drunkard. Once  beloved and highly respected, he yielded to the weakness of the flesh,  and \"died as a fool dieth\"--an object of regret and pity, a warning to  those similarly tempted.    Not long after Brother Snow was appointed to preside over the Church  in London, a circumstance occurred which plainly illustrated the  interference of evil spirits in human affairs, and most strikingly  their use as instruments to oppose the progress of the latter-day work.  A band of them undertook to frighten him from his post; but Lorenzo  Snow is one whom neither favor, fright nor force can move from the post  of duty.    At the time referred to, he occupied a well furnished upper room,  and directly after his appointment to the presidency, after retiring  to bed at night, he was aroused from sleep by the most discordant  noises. It seemed as though every piece of furniture in the room  was "]]]
