The voice seemed to come from a room at his right; not  that from which he had entered, but one still beyond this where he was.  He sprang towards the wall and examined it swiftly. Finding a division  in the tapestry, he ran his fingers quickly and heavily down the crack  between. It came upon the button of a spring. He pressed it, the door  yielded, and, throwing it back, he stepped into the room-to see a woman  struggling to resist the embraces and kisses of a man. The face was that  of the girl who had looked out of the panel in the mooshrabieh screen.  Then it was beautiful in its mirth and animation, now it was pale  and terror-stricken, as with one free hand she fiercely beat the face  pressed to hers.    The girl only had seen David enter. The man was not conscious of his  presence till he was seized and flung against the wall. The violence of  the impact brought down at his feet two weapons from the wall above  him. He seized one-a dagger-and sprang to his feet. Before he could move  forward or raise his arm, however, David struck him a blow in the neck  which flung him upon a square marble pedestal intended for a statue.  In falling his head struck violently a sharp corner of the pedestal. He  lurched, rolled over on the floor, and lay still.    The girl gave a choking cry. David quickly stooped and turned the body  over. There was a cut where the hair met the temple. He opened the  waistcoat and thrust his hand inside the shirt. Then he felt the pulse  of the limp wrist.    For a moment he looked at the face steadily, almost contemplatively it  might have seemed, and then drew both arms close to the body.    Foorgat Bey, the brother of Nahoum Pasha, was dead.    Rising, David turned, as if in a dream, to the girl. He made a motion of  the hand towards the body. She understood. Dismay was in her face, but  the look of horror and desperation was gone. She seemed not to realise,  as did David, the awful position in which they were placed, the deed  which David had done, the significance of the thing that lay at their  feet.    \"Where are thy people?\" said David. \"Come, we will go to them.\"    \"I have no people here,\" she said, in a whisper.    \"Who brought thee?\"    She made a motion behind her towards the body. David glanced down. The  eyes of the dead man were open. He stooped and closed them gently. The  collar and tie were disarranged; he straightened them, then turned again  to her.    \"I must take thee away,\" he said calmly. \"But it must be secretly.\"  He looked around, perplexed. \"We came secretly. My maid is outside the  garden--in a carriage. Oh, come, let us go, let us escape. They will  kill you--!\" Terror came into her face again. \"Thee, not me, is in  danger--name, goodness, future, all.... Which way did thee come?\"    \"Here--through many rooms--\" She made a gesture to curtains beyond. \"But  we first entered through doors with sphinxes on either side, with a room  where was a statue of Mehemet Ali.\"    It was the room through which David had come with Kaid. He took her  hand. \"Come quickly. I know the way. It is here,\" he said, pointing to  the panel-door by which he had entered.    Holding her hand still, as though she were a child, he led her quickly  from the room, and shut the panel behind them. As they passed through,  a hand drew aside the curtains on the other side of the room which they  were leaving.    Presently the face of Nahoum Pasha followed the hand. A swift glance  to the floor, then he ran forward, stooped down, and laid a hand on his  brother's breast. The slight wound on the forehead answered his rapid  scrutiny. He realised the situation as plainly as if it had been written  down for him--he knew his brother well.    Noiselessly he moved forward and touched the spring of the door through  which the two had gone. It yielded, and he passed through, closed the  door again and stealthily listened, then stole a look into the farther  chamber. It was empty. He heard the outer doors close. For a moment he  listened, then went forward and passed through into the hall. Softly  turning the handle of the big wooden doors which faced him, he opened  them an inch or so, and listened. He could hear swiftly retreating  footsteps. Presently he heard the faint noise of a gate shutting. He  nodded his head, and was about to close the doors and turn away, when  his quick ear detected footsteps again in the garden. Some one--the man,  of course--was returning.    \"May fire burn his eyes for ever! He would talk with Kald, then go again  among them all, and so pass out unsuspected and safe. For who but I--who  but I could say he did it? And I--what is my proof? Only the words which  I speak.\"    A scornful, fateful smile passed over his face. \"'Hast thou never killed  a man?' said Kaid. 'Never,' said he--'by the goodness of God, never!'  The voice of Him of Galilee, the hand of Cain, the craft of Jael. But  God is with the patient.\"    He went hastily and noiselessly-his footfall was light for so heavy a  man-through the large room to the farther side from that by which David  and Kaid had first entered. Drawing behind a clump of palms near a door  opening to a passage leading to Mizraim's quarters, he waited. He saw  David enter quickly, yet without any air of secrecy, and pass into the  little room where Kaid had left him.    For a long time there was silence.    The reasons were clear in Nahoum's mind why he should not act yet. A new  factor had changed the equation which had presented itself a short half  hour ago.    A new factor had also entered into the equation which had been presented  to David by Kaid with so flattering an insistence. He sat in the place  where Kaid had left him, his face drawn and white, his eyes burning, but  with no other \"sign of agitation. He was frozen and still. His look was  fastened now upon the door by which the Prince Pasha would enter, now  upon the door through which he had passed to the rescue of the English  girl, whom he had seen drive off safely with her maid. In their swift  passage from the Palace to the carriage, a thing had been done of even  greater moment than the killing of the sensualist in the next room.  In the journey to the gateway the girl David served had begged him to  escape with her. This he had almost sharply declined; it would be no  escape, he had said. She had urged that no one knew. He had replied that  Kaid would come again for him, and suspicion would be aroused if he were  gone.    \"Thee has safety,\" he had said. \"I will go back. I will say that I  killed him. I have taken a life, I will pay for it as is the law.\"    Excited as she was, she had seen the inflexibility of his purpose. She  had seen the issue also clearly. He would give himself up, and the whole  story would be the scandal of Europe.    \"You have no right to save me only to kill me,\" she had said  desperately. \"You would give your life, but you would destroy that  which is more than life to me. You did not intend to kill him. It was  no murder, it was punishment.\" Her voice had got harder. \"He would have  killed my life because he was evil. Will you kill it because you are  good? Will you be brave, quixotic, but not pitiful?... No, no, no!\"  she had said, as his hand was upon the gate, \"I will not go unless you  promise that you will hide the truth, if you can.\" She had laid her hand  upon his shoulder with an agonised impulse. \"You will hide it for a girl  who will cherish your memory her whole life long. Ah--God bless you!\"    She had felt that she conquered before he spoke as, indeed, he did not  speak, but nodded his head and murmured something indistinctly. But that  did not matter, for she had won; she had a feeling that all would be  well. Then he had placed her in her carriage, and she was driven swiftly  away, saying to herself half hysterically: \"I am safe, I am safe. He  will keep his word.\"    Her safety and his promise were the new factor which changed the  equation for which Kaid would presently ask the satisfaction. David's  life had suddenly come upon problems for which his whole past was no  preparation. Conscience, which had been his guide in every situation,  was now disarmed, disabled, and routed. It had come to terms.    In going quickly through the room, they had disarranged a table. The  girl's cloak had swept over it, and a piece of brie-a-brae had been  thrown upon the floor. He got up and replaced it with an attentive  air. He rearranged the other pieces on the table mechanically, seeing,  feeling another scene, another inanimate thing which must be for ever  and for ever a picture burning in his memory. Yet he appeared to be  casually doing a trivial and necessary act. He did not definitely  realise his actions; but long afterwards he could have drawn an accurate  plan of the table, could have reproduced upon it each article in its  exact place as correctly as though it had been photographed. There were  one or two spots of dust or dirt on the floor, brought in by his boots  from the garden. He flicked them aside with his handkerchief.    How still it was! Or was it his life which had become so still? It  seemed as if the world must be noiseless, for not a sound of the life in  other parts of the Palace came to him, not an echo or vibration of the  city which stirred beyond the great gateway. Was it the chilly hand of  death passing over everything, and smothering all the activities? His  pulses, which, but a few minutes past, were throbbing and pounding like  drums in his ears, seemed now to flow and beat in very quiet. Was this,  then, the way that murderers felt, that men felt who took human life--so  frozen, so little a part of their surroundings? Did they move as dead  men among the living, devitalised, vacuous calm?    His life had been suddenly twisted out of recognition. All that his  habit, his code, his morals, his religion, had imposed upon him had  been overturned in one moment. To take a human life, even in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#14)"],[1,"m, that \"nature exists entirely  in leasts,\"--is a favorite thought of Swedenborg. \"It is a constant  law of the organic body, that large, compound, or visible forms exist  and subsist from smaller, simpler, and ultimately from invisible forms,  which act similarly to the larger ones, but more perfectly and more  universally, and the least forms so perfectly and universally, as to  involve an idea representative of their entire universe.\" The unities  of each organ are so many little organs, homogeneous with their  compound; the unities of the tongue are little tongues; those of the  stomach, little stomachs; those of the heart are little hearts. This  fruitful idea furnishes a key to every secret. What was too small for  the eye to detect was read by the aggregates; what was too large, by  the units. There is no end to his application of the thought. \"Hunger  is an aggregate of very many little hungers, or losses of blood by the  little veins all over the body.\" It is the key to his theology, also.  \"Man is a kind of very minute heaven, corresponding to the world of  spirits and to heaven. Every particular idea of man, and every  affection, yea, every smallest spark of his affection, is an image and  effigy of him. A spirit may be known from only a single thought. God  is the grand man.\"  The hardihood and thoroughness of his study of  nature required a theory of forms, also. \"Forms ascend in order from  the lowest to the highest. The lowest form is angular, or the  terrestrial and corporeal. The second and next higher form is the  circular, which is also called the perpetual-angular, because the  circumference of a circle is a perpetual angle. The form above this  is the spiral, parent and measure of circular forms; its diameters are  not rectilinear, but variously circular, and have a spherical surface  for center; therefore it is called the perpetual-circular. The form  above this is the vortical, or perpetual-spiral; next, the  perpetual-vortical, or celestial; last, the perpetual-celestial, or  spiritual.\"    Was it strange that a genius so bold should take the last step,  also,--conceive that he might attain the science of all sciences, to  unlock the meaning of the world? In the first volume of the \"Animal  Kingdom,\" he broaches the subject, in a remarkable note.--    \"In our doctrine of Representations and Correspondences, we shall treat  of both these symbolical and typical resemblances, and of the  astonishing things which occur, I will not say, in the living body  only, but throughout nature, and which correspond so entirely to supreme  and spiritual things, that one would swear that the physical world was  purely symbolical of the spiritual world; insomuch, that if we choose  to express any natural truth in physical and definite vocalterms, and  to convert these terms only into the corresponding and spiritual terms,  we shall by this means elicit a spiritual truth, or theological dogma,  in place of the physical truth or precept; although no mortal would  have predicted that anything of the kind could possibly arise by bare  literal transposition; inasmuch as the one precept, considered  separately from the other, appears to have absolutely no relation to  it. I intend, hereafter, to communicate a number of examples of such  correspondences, together with a vocabulary containing the terms of  spiritual things, as well as of the physical things for which they are  to be substituted. This symbolism pervades the living body.\"    The fact, thus explicitly stated, is implied in all poetry, in allegory,  in fable, in the use of emblems, and in the structure of language.  Plato knew of it, as is evident from his twice bisected line, in the  sixth book of the Republic. Lord Bacon had found that truth and nature  differed only as seal and print; and he instanced some physical  proportions, with their translation into a moral and political sense.  Behmen, and all mystics, imply this law in their dark riddle-writing.  The poets, in as far as they are poets, use it; but it is known to  them only, as the magnet was known for ages, as a toy. Swedenborg first  put the fact into a detached and scientific statement, because it was  habitually present to him, and never not seen. It was involved, as we  explained already, in the doctrine of identity and iteration, because  the mental series exactly tallies with the material series. It required  an insight that could rank things in order and series; or, rather, it  required such rightness of position, that the poles of the eye should  coincide with the axis of the world. The earth has fed its mankind  through five or six millenniums, and they had sciences, religions,  philosophies; and yet had failed to see the correspondence of meaning  between every part and every other part. And, down to this hour,  literature has no book in which the symbolism of things is  scientifically opened. One would say, that, as soon as men had the  first hint that every sensible object,--animal, rock, river, air,--nay,  space and time, subsists not for itself, nor finally to a material  end, but as a picture-language, to tell another story of beings and  duties, other science would be put by, and a science of such grand  presage would absorb all faculties; that each man would ask of all  objects, what they mean: Why does the horizon hold me fast, with my  joy and grief, in this center? Why hear I the same sense from countless  differing voices, and read one never quite expressed fact in endless  picture-language? Yet, whether it be that these things will not be  intellectually learned, or, that many centuries must elaborate and  compose so rare and opulent a soul,--there is no comet, rock-stratum,  fossil, fish, quadruped, spider, or fungus, that, for itself, does not  interest more scholars and classifiers than the meaning and upshot of  the frame of things.    But Swedenborg was not content with the culinary use of the world. In  his fifty-fourth year, these thoughts held him fast, and his profound  mind admitted the perilous opinion, too frequent in religious history,  that he was an abnormal person, to whom was granted the privilege of  conversing with angels and spirits; and this ecstasy connected itself  with just this office of explaining the moral import of the sensible  world. To a right perception, at once broad and minute, of the order  of nature, he added the comprehension of the moral laws in their widest  social aspects; but whatever he saw, through some excessive  determination to form, in his constitution, he saw not abstractly, but  in pictures, heard it in dialogues, constructed it in events. When he  attempted to announce the law most sanely, he was forced to couch it  in parable.    Modern psychology offers no similar example of a deranged balance. The  principal powers continued to maintain a healthy action; and, to a  reader who can make due allowance in the report for the reporter's  peculiarities, the results are still instructive, and a more striking  testimony to the sublime laws he announced, than any that balanced  dulness could afford. He attempts to give some account of the modus  of the new state, affirming that \"his presence in the spiritual world  is attended with a certain separation, but only as to the intellectual  part of his mind, not as to the will part;\" and he affirms that \"he  sees, with the internal sight, the things that are in another life,  more clearly than he sees the things which are here in the world.\"    Having adopted the belief that certain books of the Old and New  Testaments were exact allegories, or written in the angelic and ecstatic  mode, he employed his remaining years in extricating from the literal,  the universal sense. He had borrowed from Plato the fine fable of \"a  most ancient people, men better than we, and dwelling nigher to the  gods;\" and Swedenborg added, that they used the earth symbolically;  that these, when they saw terrestrial objects, did not think at all  about them, but only about those which they signified. The  correspondence between thoughts and things henceforward occupied him.  \"The very organic form resembles the end inscribed on it.\" A man is  in general, and in particular, an organizd justice or injustice,  selfishness or gratitude. And the cause of this harmony he assigned  in the Arcana: \"The reason why all and single things, in the heavens  and on earth, are representative, is because they exist from an influx  of the Lord, through heaven.\" This design of exhibiting such  correspondences, which, if adequately executed, would be the poem of  the world, in which all history and science would play an essential  part, was narrowed and defeated by the exclusively theologic direction  which his inquiries took. His perception of nature is not human and  universal, but is mystical and Hebraic. He fastens each natural object  to a theologic notion:--a horse signifies carnal understanding; a tree,  perception; the moon, faith; a cat means this; an ostrich, that; an  artichoke, this other; and poorly tethers every symbol to a several  ecclesiastic sense. The slippery Proteus is not so easily caught. In  nature, each individual symbol plays innumerable parts, as each particle  of matter circulates in turn through every system. The central identity  enables any one symbol to express successively all the qualities and  shades of the real being. In the transmission of the heavenly waters,  every hose fits every hydrant. Nature avenges herself speedily on the  hard pedantry that would chain her waves. She is no literalist.  Everything must be taken genially, and we must be at the top of our  condition to understand anything rightly.    His theological bias thus fatally narrowed his interpretation of nature,  and the dictionary of symbols is yet to be written. But the interpreter,  whom mankind must still expect, will find no predecessor who has  approached so near to the true problem.    Swedenborg styles"]]]
