Dear Daisy, how wonderful he is! I will send across for  his things, shall I, and I will have Hamlet and Othello made ready for  him!\"    Bitter though it was to part with her Guru, it was impious to rebel  against the ordinances of the Guides, but there was a trace of human  resentment in Daisy's answer.    \"Things!\" she exclaimed. \"He hasn't got a thing in the world. Every  material possession chains us down to earth. You will soon come to  that, darling Lucia.\"    It occurred to Georgie that the Guru had certainly got a bottle of  brandy, but there was no use in introducing a topic that might lead to  discord, and indeed, even as Lucia went indoors to see about Hamlet and  Othello, the Guru himself having emerged from meditation, joined them  and sat down by Mrs Quantock.    \"Beloved lady,\" he said, \"all is peace and happiness. The Guides have  spoken to me so lovingly of you, and they say it is best your Guru  should come here. Perhaps I shall return later to your kind house. They  smiled when I asked that. But just now they send me here: there is more  need of me here, for already you have so much light.\"    Certainly the Guides were very tactful people, for nothing could have  soothed Mrs Quantock so effectually as a message of that kind, which  she would certainly report to Lucia when she returned from seeing about  Hamlet and Othello.    \"Oh, do they say I have much light already, Guru, dear?\" she asked.  \"That is nice of them.\"    \"Surely they said it, and now I shall go back to your house, and leave  sweet thoughts there for you. And shall I send sweet thoughts to the  home of the kind gentleman next door?\"    Georgie eagerly welcomed this proposition, for with Hermy and Ursy  coming that evening, he felt that he would have plenty of use for sweet  thoughts. He even forebore to complete in his own mind the conjecture  that was forming itself there, namely, that though the Guru would be  leaving sweet thoughts for Mrs Quantock, he would probably be taking  away the brandy bottle for himself. But Georgie knew he was only too  apt to indulge in secret cynicisms and perhaps there was no brandy to  take away by this time ... and lo and behold, he was being cynical  again.    The sun was still hot when, half an hour afterwards, he got into the  open cab which he had ordered to take him to the station to meet Hermy  and Ursy, and he put up his umbrella with its white linen cover, to  shield him from it. He did not take the motor, because either Hermy or  Ursy would have insisted on driving it, and he did not choose to put  himself in their charge. In all the years that he had lived at  Riseholme, he never remembered a time when social events--\"work,\" he  called it--had been so exciting and varied. There were Hermy and Ursy  coming this evening, and Olga Bracely and her husband (Olga Bracely and  Mr Shuttleworth sounded vaguely improper: Georgie rather liked that)  were coming tomorrow, and there was Lucia's garden-party the day after,  and every day there was to be a lesson from the Guru, so that God alone  knew when Georgie would have a moment to himself for his embroidery or  to practise the Mozart trio. But with his hair chestnut-coloured to the  very roots, and his shining nails, and his comfortable boots, he felt  extremely young and fit for anything. Soon, under the influence of the  new creed with its postures and breathings, he would feel younger and  more vigorous yet.    But he wished that it had been he who had found this pamphlet on  Eastern philosophies, which had led Mrs Quantock to make the inquiries  that had resulted in the epiphany of the Guru. Of course when once  Lucia had heard about it, she was certain to constitute herself head  and leader of the movement, and it was really remarkable how completely  she had done that. In that meeting in the garden just now she had just  sailed through Mrs Quantock as calmly as a steamer cuts through the  waters of the sea, throwing her off from her penetrating bows like a  spent wave. But baffled though she was for the moment, Georgie had been  aware that Mrs Quantock seethed with revolutionary ideas: she deeply  resented this confiscation of what was certainly her property, though  she was impotent to stop it, and Georgie knew just what she felt. It  was all very well to say that Lucia's schemes were entirely in accord  with the purposes of the Guides. That might be so, but Mrs Quantock  would not cease to think that she had been robbed....    Yet nothing mattered if all the class found themselves getting young  and active and loving and excellent under this tuition. It was that  notion which had taken such entire command of them all, and for his  part Georgie did not really care who owned the Guru, so to speak, if  only he got the benefit of his teachings. For social purposes Lucia had  annexed him, and doubtless with him in the house she could get little  instructions and hints that would not count as a lesson, but after all,  Georgie had still got Olga Bracely to himself, for he had not breathed  a word of her advent to Lucia. He felt rather like one who, when  revolutionary ideas are in the air, had concealed a revolver in his  pocket. He did not formulate to himself precisely what he was going to  do with it, but it gave him a sense of power to know it was there.    The train came in, but he looked in vain for his sisters. They had  distinctly said they were arriving by it, but in a couple of minutes it  was perfectly clear that they had done nothing of the kind, for the  only person who got out was Mrs Weston's cook, who as all the world  knew went into Brinton every Wednesday to buy fish. At the rear of the  train, however, was an immense quantity of luggage being taken out,  which could not all be Mrs Weston's fish, and indeed, even at that  distance there was something familiar to Georgie about a very large  green hold-all which was dumped there. Perhaps Hermy and Ursy had  travelled in the van, because \"it was such a lark,\" or for some other  tomboy reason, and he went down the platform to investigate. There were  bags of golf clubs, and a dog, and portmanteaux, and even as the  conviction dawned on him that he had seen some of these objects before,  the guard, to whom Georgie always gave half-a-crown when he travelled  by this train, presented him with a note scrawled in pencil. It ran--      \"Dearest Georgie,      \"It was such a lovely day that when we got to Paddington Ursy and I    decided to bicycle down instead, so for a lark we sent our things on,    and we may arrive tonight, but probably tomorrow. Take care of    Tiptree: and give him plenty of jam. He loves it.                                  \"Yours,                                      \"HERMY.        \"P.S.--Tipsipoozie doesn't really bite: it's only his fun.\"    Georgie crumpled up this odious epistle, and became aware that  Tipsipoozie, a lean Irish terrier, was regarding him with peculiar  disfavour, and shewing all his teeth, probably in fun. In pursuance of  this humorous idea, he then darted towards Georgie, and would have been  extremely funny, if he had not been handicapped by the bag of golf-clubs  to which he was tethered. As it was, he pursued him down the platform,  towing the clubs after him, till he got entangled in them and fell down.    Georgie hated dogs at any time, though he had never hated one so much  as Tipsipoozie, and the problems of life became more complicated than  ever. Certainly he was not going to drive back with Tipsipoozie in his  cab, and it became necessary to hire another for that abominable hound  and the rest of the luggage. And what on earth was to happen when he  arrived home, if Tipsipoozie did not drop his fun and become serious?  Foljambe, it is true, liked dogs, so perhaps dogs liked her ... \"But it  is most tarsome of Hermy!\" thought Georgie bitterly. \"I wonder what the  Guru would do.\" There ensued a very trying ten minutes, in which the  station-master, the porters, Georgie and Mrs Weston's maid all called  Tipsipoozie a good dog as he lay on the ground snapping promiscuously  at those who praised him. Eventually a valiant porter picked up the bag  of clubs, and by holding them out in front of him at the extreme length  of his arms, in the manner of a fishing rod, with Tipsipoozie on a  short chain at the other end of the bag, like a savage fish, cursing  and swearing, managed to propel him into the cab, and there was another  half-crown gone. Georgie thereupon got into his cab and sped homewards  in order to arrive there first, and consult with Foljambe. Foljambe  usually thought of something.    Foljambe came out at the noise of the arriving wheels and Georgie  explained the absence of his sisters and the advent of an atrocious  dog.    \"He's very fierce,\" he said, \"but he likes jam.\"    Foljambe gave that supreme smile which sometimes Georgie resented. Now  he hailed it, as if it was \"an angel-face's smile.\"    \"I'll see to him, sir,\" she said. \"I've brought up your tea.\"    \"But you'll take care, Foljambe won't you?\" he asked.    \"I expect he'd better take care,\" returned the intrepid woman.    Georgie, as he often said, trusted Foljambe completely, which must  explain why he went into his drawing-room, shut the door, and looked  out of the window when the second cab arrived. She opened the door, put  her arms inside, and next moment emerged again with Tipsipoozie on the  end of the chain, making extravagant exhibitions of delight. Then to  Georgie's horror, the drawing-room door opened, and in came Tipsipoozie  without any chain at all. Rapidly sending a message of love in all  directions like a S. O. S. call, Georgie put a small chair in front of  him, to shield his legs. Tipsipoozie evidently thought it was a game,  and hid behind the sofa to rush out again from ambush.    \"Just got snappy being tied to those golf-clubs,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#14)"],[1,"eluded  his grasp. The story of Tantalus is well told by PROFESSOR BLACKIE,  as follows:      Tantalus.      O Tantalus! thou wert a man    More blest than all since earth began      Its weary round to travel;    But, placed in Paradise, like Eve,    Thine own damnation thou didst weave,      Without help from the devil.    Alas! I fear thy tale to tell;    Thou'rt in the deepest pool of hell,      And shalt be there forever.    For why? When thou on lofty seat    Didst sit, and eat immortal meat      With Jove, the bounteous Giver,    The gods before thee loosed their tongue,    And many a mirthful ballad sung,    And all their secrets open flung      Into thy mortal ear.    The poet then goes on to describe the gossip, and pleasures, and  jealousies, and scandals of Olympus which Tantalus heard and  witnessed, and then proceeds as follows:      But witless he such grace to prize;      And, with licentious babble,    He blazed the secrets of the skies      Through all the human rabble,    And fed the greed of tattlers vain      With high celestial scandal,    And lent to every eager brain      And wanton tongue a handle    Against the gods. For which great sin,      By righteous Jove's command,    In hell's black pool up to the chin      The thirsty king doth stand:    With-parched throat he longs to drink,      But when he bends to sip,    The envious waves receding sink,      And cheat his pining lip.    Like in character was the punishment inflicted upon Sis'y-phus,  \"the most crafty of men,\" as Homer calls him. Being condemned to  roll a huge stone up a hill, it proved to be a never-ending,  still-beginning toil, for as soon as the stone reached the summit  it rolled down again into the plain. So, also, Ix-i'on, \"the Cain  of Greece,\" as he is expressly called--the first shedder of kindred  blood--was doomed to be fastened, with brazen bands, to an  ever-revolving fiery wheel. But the very refinement of torment,  similar to that inflicted upon Prometheus, was that suffered by  the giant Tit'y-us, who was placed on his back, while vultures  constantly fed upon his liver, which grew again as fast as it was  eaten.      THE DESCENT OF OR'PHEUS.    Only once do we learn that these torments ceased, and that was  when the musician Orpheus, lyre in hand, descended to the lower  world to reclaim his beloved wife, the lost Eu-ryd'i-ce. At the  music of his \"golden shell\" Tantalus forgot his thirst, Sisyphus  rested from his toil, the wheel of Ixion stood still, and Tityus  ceased his moaning. The poet OVID thus describes the wonderful  effects of the musician's skill:      The very bloodless shades attention keep,    And, silent, seem compassionate to weep;    Even Tantalus his flood unthirsty views,    Nor flies the stream, nor he the stream pursues:    Ixion's wondrous wheel its whirl suspends,    And the voracious vulture, charmed, attends;    No more the Bel'i-des their toil bemoan,    And Sisyphus, reclined, sits listening on the stone.      --Trans. by CONGREVE.    Pope's translation of this scene from the Iliad is peculiarly  melodious:      But when, through all the infernal bounds    Which flaming Phleg'e-thon surrounds,    Love, strong as death, the poet led    To the pale nations of the dead,    What sounds were heard,    What scenes appeared,    O'er all the dreary coasts!    Dreadful gleams,    Dismal screams,    Fires that glow,    Shrieks of woe,    Sullen moans,    Hollow groans,    And cries of tortured ghost!!!      But hark! he strikes the golden lyre;    And see! the tortured ghosts respire!    See! shady forms advance!    Thy stone, O Sisyphus, stands still,    Ixion rests upon his wheel,    And the pale spectres dance;    The Furies sink upon their iron beds,    And snakes uncurled hang listening round their heads.    The Greeks also believed in an Elys'ium--some distant island of  the ocean, ever cooled by refreshing breezes, and where spring  perpetual reigned--to which, after death, the blessed were conveyed,  and where they were permitted to enjoy it happy destiny. In the  Fourth Book of the Odyssey the sea god Pro'teus, in predicting  for Menelaus a happier lot than that of Hades, thus describes the  Elysian plains:      But oh! beloved of Heaven! reserved for thee    A happier lot the smiling Fates decree:    Free from that law beneath whose mortal sway    Matter is changed and varying forms decay,    Elysium shall be thine--the blissful plains    Of utmost earth, where Rhadaman'thus reigns.    Joys ever young, unmixed with pain or fear,    Fill the wide circle of the eternal year.    Stern Winter smiles on that auspicious clime;    The fields are florid with unfading prime;    From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow,    Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow;    But from the breezy deep the blest inhale    The fragrant murmurs of the western gale.      --POPE'S Trans.    Similar views are expressed by the lyric poet PINDAR in the  following lines:      All whose steadfast virtue thrice      Each side the grave unchanged hath stood,    Still unseduced, unstained with vice--      They, by Jove's mysterious road,    Pass to Saturn's realm of rest--    Happy isle, that holds the blest;    Where sea-born breezes gently blow    O'er blooms of gold that round them glow,    Which Nature, boon from stream or strand      Or goodly tree, profusely showers;    Whence pluck they many a fragrant band,      And braid their locks with never-fading flowers.      --Trans. by A. MOORE.    There is so much similarity between the mythology of the early  Greeks and that of many of the Asiatic nations, that we give  place here to the supposed meditations of a Hindu prince and  skeptic on the great subject of a future state of existence,  as a fitting close of our brief review of the religious beliefs  of the ancients. Among the Asiatic nations are to be found accounts  of the Creation, and of multitudes of gods, good and evil, all  quite as pronounced as those that are derived from the Grecian  myths; and while the wildest and grossest of superstitious fancies  have prevailed among the common people, skepticism and atheistic  doubt are known to have been nearly universal among the learned.  The poem which we give in this connection, therefore, though  professedly a Hindu creation, may be accepted not only as  portraying Hindu doubt and despondency, but also as a faithful  picture of the anxiety, doubt, and almost utter despair, not only  of the ancient Greeks; but of the entire heathen world, concerning  the destiny of mankind.    The Hindu skeptic tells us that ever since mankind began their  race on this earth they have been seeking for the \"signs and  steps of a God;\" and that in mystical India, where the deities  hover and swarm, and a million shrines stand open, with their  myriad idols and, legions of muttering priests, mankind are still  groping in darkness; still listening, and as yet vainly hoping  for a message that shall tell what the wonders of creation mean,  and whither they tend; ever vainly seeking for a refuge from the  ills of life, and a rest beyond for the weary and heavy-laden, He  turns to the deified heroes of his race, and though long he watches  and worships for a solution of the mysteries of life, he waits in  vain for an answer, for their marble features never relax in  response to his prayers and entreaties; and he says, mournfully,  \"Alas! for the gods are dumb.\" The darts of death still fall as  surely as ever, hurled by a Power unseen and a hand unknown; and  beyond the veil all is obscurity and gloom.      I.      All the world over, I wonder, in lands that I never have trod,    Are the people eternally seeking for the signs and steps of a God?    Westward across the ocean, and northward beyond the snow,    Do they all stand gazing, as ever? and what do the wisest know?      II.      Here, in this mystical India, the deities hover and swarm    Like the wild bees heard in the tree-tops, or the gusts of a        gathering storm;    In the air men hear their voices, their feet on the rocks are seen,    Yet we all say, \"Whence is the message--and what may the        wonders mean?\"      III.      A million shrines stand open, and ever the censer swings,    As they bow to a mystic symbol or the figures of ancient kings;    And the incense rises ever, and rises the endless cry    Of those who are heavy-laden, and of cowards loath to die.      IV.      For the destiny drives us together like deer in a pass of the hills:    Above is the sky, and around us the sound and the shot that kills.    Pushed by a Power we see not, and struck by a hand unknown,    We pray to the trees for shelter, and press our lips to a stone.      V.      The trees wave a shadowy answer, and the rock frowns hollow and grim,    And the form and the nod of the demon are caught in the        twilight dim;    And we look to the sunlight falling afar on the mountain crest--    Is there never a path runs upward to a refuge there and a rest?      VI.      The path--ah, who has shown it, and which is the faithful guide?    The haven--ah, who has known it? for steep is the mountain-side.    For ever the shot strikes surely, and ever the wasted breath    Of the praying multitude rises, whose answer is only death!      VII.      Here are the tombs of my kinsfolk, the first of an ancient name--    Chiefs who were slain on the war-field, and women who died in flame.    They are gods, these kings of the foretime, they are spirits who        guard our race:    Ever I watch and worship--they sit with a marble face.      VIII.      And the myriad idols around me, and the legion of muttering priests--    The revels and rites unholy, the dark, unspeakable feasts--    What have they wrung from the silence? Hath even a Whisper come    Of the secret--whence and whither? Alas! for the gods are dumb.
