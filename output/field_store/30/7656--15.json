Didn't they tell you about it?\"    \"No, sir.\"    When Mr. Mole addressed his pupil as \"sir,\" young Jack knew pretty well  that he thought he was being humbugged.    There is an old saying--\"Jack was as good as his master.\"    Putting on a look of injured innocence, he called his comrade Harry to  corroborate what he had said.    \"That's quite true, Mr. Mole.\"    \"That Mr. Jefferson went with Mr. Harkaway and Harvey to see a  necromancer?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Preposterous!\" quoth Mr. Mole. \"Why, whatever is the world coming to  next? We shall have them spirit-rapping and table-turning and such-like  muck, I suppose.\"    Jack looked serious.    \"Then you don't believe in necromancy--that they can tell the past and  the future by the aid of astrology?\"    \"Pickles!\"    It would have astonished Messieurs Crosse and Blackwell themselves,  could they have heard what a deal that one word could convey when  uttered by an Isaac Mole.    \"Well, sir,\" said Harry Girdwood, seriously, \"the wizard told us some  very remarkable things indeed.\"    \"What did he tell you?\"    \"Many things, many very wonderful things; but one of the most wonderful  was about you, sir.\"    Mr. Mole started.    \"Don't you try to come the old soldier over me,\" said Mole.    Harry Girdwood protested that he held Mr. Mole in far too much respect  to essay any thing like coming the ancient military, or indeed anything  else which might be construed into want of proper feeling.    Mr. Mole looked hard at him.    \"And what did he say about me?\"    \"He said that all the intelligence of our party was centred in one  person.\"    \"Well?\"    \"And that the initials of the person in question were I. M.\"    \"Now, Jack.\"    \"Sir.\"    \"You two boys are conspiring against me.\"    \"You are rather hard upon us, sir,\" said Harry Girdwood, with an  injured look.    \"Was I? Dear me, I didn't mean that,\" said poor Mole. \"But I'll go and  see this wizard, as you call him.\"    \"It might startle you, sir.\"    \"Stuff and nonsense, Harry; my nerves are iron--iron, I tell you.\"    \"They had need be of steel, if you really mean to go.\"    \"I'll go, and you shall go with me, Harry,\" said Mr. Mole; \"and I'll  unmask this wretched impostor before you.\"    And down came his clenched fist upon the table, with a fierceness and  energy which made all the things leap up.           *       *       *       *       *    The chamber of mystery was arranged with a keen eye to effect.    The present possessors of the place had preserved all the adjuncts  which had looked so effective during the career of the necromancer, who  had fled ignominiously.    A huge stuffed alligator swung from the ceiling, and the lighting of  the room was effected by means of two or three swinging lamps, that  burnt dimly blue, and made the place look sepulchral enough to satisfy  the most morbid cravings for the horrible.    At the further end of the room was a \"charmed circle,\" drawn with  chalk, and set around it was a row of hideous grinning skulls, which  suggested that a hint had been borrowed from Zamiel, in \"Der  Freyschutz.\"    Besides these matters, there were several skeletons stuck up in the  most alarming attitudes.    Beside the chair was a large oval frame.    Upon the other side of the necromancer's chair was a heavy curtain, or  _portiere_ of cloth, covered with fantastic figures, and this was  drawn aside a minute or so after Mr. Mole and Harry Girdwood appeared.    Then, through the dark aperture thus disclosed, the wizard hobbled in.    Not the wizard that we have seen before, but a little old man bent half  double with age, and of whom little was to be seen save a long white  beard and an appropriate robe.    He leant heavily upon a staff, and sank into his chair with evident  pain and difficulty.    \"What would ye with me?\" said the necromancer, in feeble, querulous  tones. \"If ye have come to scoff again, begone ere I summon an evil  spirit to blight ye.\"    Mr. Mole said nothing.    But when Harry Girdwood placed his hand nervously upon the old  gentleman's arm, as if for protection, he felt that he was trembling  slightly.    \"He knows that we are English, you see,\" whispered Harry.    \"Ye-es--ahem!--ye-es.\"    \"Do you hear me?\" said the wizard.    \"Ye-es, oh, yes, sir,\" said Mr. Mole, who could not, for the life of  him, get his voice above a whisper.    \"Then answer.\"    \"By all means! decidedly--quite so, I assure you.\"    \"What? Beware! Do you mean to doubt and mock?\"    \"Oh, dear; yes.\"    \"Hah!\"    \"That is, no. I really don't know what I am saying.\"    \"Silence, or the fiends will have your ber-lud ber-lud--Do you hear  me?\" shrieked the old wizard.    \"Quite so. Dear, dear me, Harry,\" said Mr. Mole in an undertone, \"what  a very remarkable person, and I don't want to lose my ber-lud.\"    \"What do you say now, sir? Do you feel sure that he is a humbug?\"    \"Of course not, but--\"    At this juncture their conversation was cut short by a low, rumbling  noise, that sounded like distant thunder.    As it continued, it increased in strength, until it became absolutely  deafening.    Then suddenly upon a sign from the necromancer, it ceased, and the man  of mystery arose and pointed menacingly with his wand at Mole.    \"Ye have thought well to neglect my warning,\" he said, in a voice which  thrilled poor Mole strangely; \"the secrets of your inmost heart are  known to me as to my familiar, and the penalty must be enacted.\"    Mole bounced up.    \"Goodness me!\"    Harry Girdwood laid a trembling hand upon the unhappy old gentleman,  and played the part of Job's comforter once again with considerable  effect.    \"We are lost.\"    \"Don't, Harry, don't! Pray consider Mrs. Mole and the two babes.\"    \"Try and melt him with a very humble apology.\"    \"I will, I do!\" exclaimed Mr. Mole in great excitement. \"I really did  not mean it, Mr. Conjuror; 'pon my soul, I did not; and pray do not let  your vampires take my her-lud.\"    \"Enough,\" said the wizard, sternly; \"for once your ignorance shall  excuse you. Now say what you would have with me and begone.\"    \"I think I should like to go,\" Mole whispered to Harry,    \"What for?\"    \"We have been a long while here,\" said Mr. Mole in the same tone; \"Mrs.  M, will be looking for me.\"    \"Perhaps you don't feel quite comfortable here.\"    \"Comfortable,\" said Mr. Mole with a sickly smile; \"oh, dear me, yes, I  never was jollier.\"    \"A little nervous perhaps, sir.\"    \"My dear boy,\" said Mole, positively, \"I have nerves of iron, literally  iron. Ha! what noise is that?\"    \"Only the magician's evil spirit, or his familiar, as he calls it.\"    \"Strange,\" said Mole; \"but sheer humbug of course.\"    \"Humbug?\"    \"Hush!\" exclaimed Mr. Mole, very anxiously.    Bang went that deafening thunder again, and Mr. Mole hopped towards the  door.    Harry Girdwood followed him closely up.    \"You are uncomfortable, Mr. Mole.\"    \"Not at all; nerves of adamant, Harry.\"    The latter laughed.    Never was there such an audacious humbug as Isaac Mole.    \"You see that frame, sir, beside the wizard's chair?\" said Girdwood.    \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Mole; \"what of it?\"    \"He showed us some marvels there last time.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"A magic mirror.\"    \"You must have been thoroughly well cheated; now, what could he have  shown you there?\"    \"Wonders,\" replied Harry impressively; \"you, amongst other marvels.\"    \"Me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean, sir, that you appeared before us as plainly as I see you now.\"    Mr. Mole certainly looked serious at this.    \"He can show you anyone you may want to see,\" said Harry.    \"Never!\"    \"Try him.\"    \"I will,\" said Mr. Mole, with a show of determination, but shaking all  over.    \"Now, O sceptic, what proof of my lore would ye have? Would ye know  something of yourself?\"    \"No.\"    \"Yes,\" said Harry Girdwood for him promptly.    The wizard inclined his head gravely, and opened a large volume before  him upon the table.    After poring over this for a time, he said the following doggrel in a  deep bass voice--                         \"The doom of Mole is understood,                        For ever more to walk on wood;                        Though upon macadam or stone                        Yet he shall walk on wood alone.                         \"Let him march out on asphalte--tile,                        In orange groves his thoughts beguile;                        Where'er he be, the fate of Mole's                        To scud through life upon bare poles\"    This peculiar incantation had its effect somewhat increased by soft  music.    \"Ahem!\" said Mr. Mole, \"it didn't want a wizard to tell me that.\"    \"What, sir?\" demanded Harry, innocently.    \"About my wooden legs; my infirmity is visible to every body.\"    \"But how could he know?\"    \"By looking.\"    \"Still sceptical,\" said the wizard, who had very sharp ears; \"shall I  consult my book again?\"    \"No, no,\" said Mr. Mole, uneasily.    But Harry Girdwood said \"Yes.\"    He did not want to end the scene yet.    \"What would you?\" demanded the magician sternly.    Harry commenced to whisper to Mr. Mole.    \"Come, sir, pluck up your courage, and find out something about  yourself. You know the past--why not ask him about the future?\"    \"He might be rude enough to say something unpleasant, Harry. However,  I'll try him.\"    Then, with a very polite bow, Mr. Mole asked--    \"Can you tell me, Mr. Magician, what my ultimate fate is?\"    The necromancer took two steps forward and seized Mr. Mole's hand.    \"I find that the line of life is tinged with the hue of blood,\" said  he, in solemn tones, after a lengthened inspection of the palm.    \"Dear me, how unpleasant--I washed my hands not long ago.\"    \"Man! do you think you can wash away the decrees of fate or sponge out  the solemn words"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#14)"],[1,"the embrasures, or to climb the  sandbags; but as fast as they did so, they were cut down or bayoneted by  its defenders. Those trying to land at other points were impeded by the  bushes, and numbers were killed; but they pressed on so furiously that  at last Mr. Ferguson, who had been moving backwards and forwards along  the line, thought it best to call the men in, and in a minute or two  the whole party were collected in the little fort, and ranged along the  sides.    With furious yells the Malays came on, and although swept by volleys of  musketry reached the bamboos, which they strove in vain to pluck up  or climb. In the meantime the eighteen pounders had never ceased their  fire, the sailors working them steadily, regardless of the fight that  was going on on either flank. Here the little brass guns did good  service; each time they were fired the recoil sent them tumbling from  the top of the sandbags, only, however, to be seized, sponged, and  loaded, by the four sailors in charge of each, and then lifted to their  place again, crammed with bullets to the muzzle, in readiness to check  the next charge of the Malays. Suddenly their yells redoubled, and were  answered by similar shouts from the forest.    \"The rajah's troops have come up,\" the first lieutenant said to the  marine officer; \"our position is getting serious. Do you think that we  could make our way back to the boats without great loss? We have sunk  two of their craft, have badly damaged the others, and inflicted very  heavy loss on them.\"    \"It would be a very risky operation; but it might be done, Ferguson.  Listen!\"    There was a fresh outburst of shouts, this time on the path by which  they had come. Evidently a number of the newly arrived Malays had struck  into it by some other track from the town.    \"That settles it,\" the lieutenant said shortly; \"we must fight it out  here. It is lucky we have a fair stock of ammunition, and can keep it  up for some hours yet. You see, the sailors have not had to use their  pistols yet, and they will astonish those fellows if they do manage to  scale the sandbags.\"    For another half hour the fighting continued. Again and again the Malays  fell back, but only to return to the attack with fresh fury, and the  defenders had been obliged to betake themselves more than once to their  pistols. The two heavy guns were now removed from their position to the  sides, for the attack by boats had ceased entirely, and the destruction  of the prahus was of less importance than the defense of the little fort  from the attacks on its flanks. The operation began just as the Malays  made one of their retreats, and by the time they returned, the guns were  placed in their new position, their muzzles peeping out from among the  sandbags, while the embrasures on the water face had been closed by bags  taken from the upper line. The effect of the fire at such close quarters  was to drive the Malays flying into the forest. Shortly afterwards the  sound of chopping was heard.    \"The beggars are trying to cut a path through the jungle to our rear,  Dick,\" Harry Parkhurst said.    \"Obstinate brutes! But I don't think much of that, Harry: they will get  on well enough until they arrive within twenty or thirty yards of us,  when we can pepper them so hotly that they will soon get sick of it.\"    At this moment there was the report of a heavy gun, and a shell crashed  through the forest fifty yards in the rear of the fort. Loud yells of  rage and alarm rose from the Malays, while a hearty cheer broke from the  defenders of the fort. Closely following, came the sound of another gun,  and then a rain of grape, some of which whistled over the fort.    \"Keep yourselves well down behind the sandbags, men,\" Lieutenant  Ferguson shouted; \"the captain knows that we have shelter, and will  sweep the Malays out of the forest round us. That shot must have done  great execution among the Malays on the path between us and the boats.\"    The guns of the ship kept up a heavy fire, searching the wood for some  distance round with shell, and pouring volleys of grape into the trees  near the battery. Presently the fire ceased.    \"I fancy they have all bolted, Dick,\" his comrade said; \"after the first  five minutes we have not heard a sound. I wonder what the prahus are  doing?\"    A minute later the lieutenant said, \"Mr. Morrison, take a dozen men and  make your way along the path until you get to the boats. I hope they  have escaped. If they are within hail go on board, and report to the  captain that we have sunk two of the prahus, and that for the present  the Malays who have been attacking us have made off. Say that large  numbers of them have gone on board the four prahus, and that I am about  to open fire upon them again.\"    As soon as the mate had left, parties of men were set to work to shift  the guns to their old positions, and fire was again opened upon the  piratical prahus, who replied, as before, with their little guns. A  very few minutes later a shell flew overhead, and fell in the water near  where the craft were anchored. Another and another followed quickly.  Intense excitement was manifest on board the prahus, and almost  immediately their cables were cut, oars got out, and at a great rate  they started down the creek.    \"The place has got too hot for them altogether, Harry; they think it  better to run the gauntlet of the ship's guns than to be sunk at their  moorings.\"    Scarcely had the prahus issued from the pool, than the guns of the ship  were heard.    \"I am afraid that some of them will get away, Harry. The beggars row so  fast that there won't be time to give them more than one broadside  as they pass. If the ship is aground, which is likely enough, for the  captain pushed up farther than we thought possible, they will be pretty  safe when they have once got past her.\"    Presently the guns were heard to fire in rapid succession. Loud yells  and cries followed; then came shouts of triumph and defiance; then  all was still, save that a few cannon shot were discharged at regular  intervals.    \"They have got one of the guns round to fire over the stern, Dick.  There, it has stopped now; evidently the prahus have got round the next  corner. It is a pity that any of them should have escaped, and they  would not have done so if the Serpent had remained at the mouth of the  creek; but I suppose the captain became anxious at the continuation of  the heavy firing here, and so came up to our help. It is lucky he  did so, for, though we might have beaten them off, they were in such  tremendous force that I fancy it would have gone hard with us in the  long run. I was beginning to think so myself, Harry.\"    Dr. Horsley had been busy enough from the time that the fighting began  in earnest. Ten men had been killed by balls that had passed through the  embrasures, or by kris or lance wounds, and twenty-eight others had been  more or less severely wounded. A quarter of an hour after the firing  ceased, Captain Forrest himself, with the mate, rowed into the pool  in one of the cutters, and landed at the end of the path close to the  battery.    \"I congratulate you on your success, Mr. Ferguson,\" he said, shaking  hands with the first lieutenant; \"it has been a very hot affair, and by  Mr. Morrison's report it was just as well that I decided to change  my plan and come up to your aid, though it has resulted in two of the  prahus getting away.\"    \"Then you sank two of them, sir?\"    \"No, indeed, we only sank one; the third went down just after we saw her  come out from the pool. Certainly we had not hit her, so that the honor  of accounting for three out of six of the craft falls to you and your  party. Well, Doctor, what is your report? I am afraid it is a bad one.\"    \"Serious, indeed,\" he went on, after he had received the figures. \"Still  it is much less than might have been expected from attacking such a host  of pirates. I am glad to hear that none of the officers are dangerously  wounded.\"    \"Parkhurst had his forearm laid open with a cut from a kris, and  Balderson had one of their spears through his ear. Dr. Horsley said if  it had been half an inch more to the left, it would probably have killed  him. Lieutenant Somers of the marines is more badly hurt, a spear having  gone through the thigh. It cut an artery. Luckily the doctor was close  to him at the moment, and clapped on a tourniquet, and then cut down  to the artery and tied it. As he says, 'A delay of two minutes, and it  would have been all up with the young fellow.' Are the boats safe, sir?\"    \"Yes, the boat keepers pushed off a little way when the firing began in  the forest, and when they heard the shouts of a large party of the  enemy coming along the path, they went out almost into the middle of  the creek; and it was well they did, for many of the Malays came down  through the path you cut, and would have riddled them with their spears  had they been within reach. The boat keepers acted very wisely; all of  them got into the gig and towed the other boats astern, so that if the  Malays came along, either in their prahus or in their boats, they could  have cut them adrift and made a race of it down to the ship.    \"Well, I think that there is nothing more to be done here. The men may  as well have a tot of grog served out, and then the sailors can march  down to the landing place and bring up the boats and take the guns and  what ammunition you have left, on board. Mr. Morrison will go back  with me to the ship; he has one of his arms broken by a ball from the  prahus.\"    \"I did not know that he was wounded, sir; he did not report it. I should  not have sent him if I had known it.\"    \"It is just as well as it is, Ferguson; it will give me an opportunity  of specially recommending him for promotion in my report. The assistant  surgeon temporarily bandaged his arm when he reached the ship.\"    \"Is she afloat, sir?\"    \"No; I want you back "]]]
