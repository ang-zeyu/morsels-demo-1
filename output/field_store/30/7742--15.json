[Illustration]        FREDERICK WARNE & CO., INC.        NEW YORK        Copyright, 1904      BY      FREDERICK WARNE & Co.        Copyright renewed, 1932        FOR THE CHILDREN OF SAWREY        FROM      OLD MR. BUNNY      [Illustration]    One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.    He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.    A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside  him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.    As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road,  and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who  lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of  all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and  Peter.    Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool  mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold  herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call  lavender).    Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.    He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of  his Cousin Peter.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red  cotton pocket-handkerchief.    \"Peter,\" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, \"who has got your clothes?\"    Peter replied, \"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\" and described how  he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.    Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr.  McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for  the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Peter said he hoped that it would rain.    At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole,  calling: \"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"    Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.    They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the  bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.  Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped  with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Little Benjamin said: \"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate;  the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.\"    Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below  was newly raked and quite soft.    It had been sown with lettuces.    They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially  little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back  Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the  pocket-handkerchief.    They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;  there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.    Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.    Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with  onions, as a little present for his Aunt.    Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.  He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father  to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.    (The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)    The lettuces certainly were very fine.    Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently  he dropped half the onions.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree  with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of  the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red  brick wall.    The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at  Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.    Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises  worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!    He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.    This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!    Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no  time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large  basket....    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.    Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!    Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.    She sat there for _five hours_.           *       *       *       *       *    I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,  because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it  made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.    The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon;  but still the cat sat upon the basket.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of  mortar fell from the wall above.    The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of  the wall of the upper terrace.    He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his  hand.    He was looking for his son.    Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.    He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the  cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse,  scratching off a handful of fur.    The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the  door.    Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears,  and whipped him with the little switch.    Then he took out his nephew Peter.    Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the  garden.    [Illustration]    When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several  things which perplexed him.    It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a  pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!    Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut  herself up _inside_ the greenhouse, locking the door upon the _outside_.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see  that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the  pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung  them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the  rabbit-tobacco.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide  spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To  SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any  particular state visit http://pglaf.org    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation  methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate      Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic  works.    Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm  concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared  with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project  Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.  unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily  keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.    Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's  eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,  compressed (zipped), HTML and others.    Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over  the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.  VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving  new filenames and etext numbers.    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:    http://www.gutenberg.org    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.    EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,  are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to  download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular  search system you may utilize the following addresses and just  download by the etext year.    http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06        (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,       98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)    EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are  filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part  of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is  identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single  digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For  example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:    http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234    or filename 24689 would be found at:  http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689    An alternative method of locating eBooks:  http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL    *** END: FULL LICENSE ***"]]]
