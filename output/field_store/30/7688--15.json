It rises aloft with steep cliffs,  looking towards the Bithynian sea; and beneath it smooth rocks, ever  washed by the sea, stand rooted firm; and round them the wave rolls and  thunders loud, but above, wide-spreading plane trees grow on the topmost  point. And from it towards the land a hollow glen slopes gradually away,  where there is a cave of Hades overarched by wood and rocks. From here  an icy breath, unceasingly issuing from the chill recess, ever forms a  glistening rime which melts again beneath the midday sun. And never does  silence hold that grim headland, but there is a continual murmur from  the sounding sea and the leaves that quiver in the winds from the  cave. And here is the outfall of the river Acheron which bursts its way  through the headland and falls into the Eastern sea, and a hollow ravine  brings it down from above. In after times the Nisaean Megarians named  it Soonautes [1202] when they were about to settle in the land of the  Mariandyni. For indeed the river saved them with their ships when they  were caught in a violent tempest. By this way the heroes took the ship  through [1203] the Acherusian headland and came to land over against it  as the wind had just ceased.    (ll. 752-773) Not long had they come unmarked by Lycus, the lord of that  land, and the Mariandyni--they, the slayers of Amycus, according to the  report which the people heard before; but for that very deed they even  made a league with the heroes. And Polydeuces himself they welcomed as  a god, flocking from every side, since for a long time had they been  warring against the arrogant Bebrycians. And so they went up all  together into the city, and all that day with friendly feelings made  ready a feast within the palace of Lycus and gladdened their souls  with converse. Aeson's son told him the lineage and name of each of his  comrades and the behests of Pelias, and how they were welcomed by the  Lemnian women, and all that they did at Dolionian Cyzieus; and how they  reached the Mysian land and Cius, where, sore against their will, they  left behind the hero Heracles, and he told the saying of Glaucus, and  how they slew the Bebrycians and Amycus, and he told of the prophecies  and affliction of Phineus, and how they escaped the Cyanean rocks, and  how they met with Leto's son at the island. And as he told all, Lycus  was charmed in soul with listening; and he grieved for Heracles left  behind, and spake as follows among them all:    (ll. 774-810) \"O friends, what a man he was from whose help ye have  fallen away, as ye cleave your long path to Aeetes; for well do I know  that I saw him here in the halls of Dascylus my father, when he came  hither on foot through the land of Asia bringing the girdle of warlike  Hippolyte; and me he found with the down just growing on my cheeks. And  here, when my brother Priolas was slain by the Mysians--my brother, whom  ever since the people lament with most piteous dirges--he entered the  lists with Titias in boxing and slew him, mighty Titias, who surpassed  all the youths in beauty and strength; and he dashed his teeth to the  ground. Together with the Mysians he subdued beneath my father's sway  the Phrygians also, who inhabit the lands next to us, and he made his  own the tribes of the Bithynians and their land, as far as the mouth  of Rhebas and the peak of Colone; and besides them the Paphlagonians  of Pelops yielded just as they were, even all those round whom the dark  water of Billaeus breaks. But now the Bebrycians and the insolence of  Amycus have robbed me, since Heracles dwells far away, for they have  long been cutting off huge pieces of my land until they have set their  bounds at the meadows of deep-flowing Hypius. Nevertheless, by your  hands have they paid the penalty; and it was not without the will of  heaven, I trow, that he brought war on the Bebrycians this day--he,  the son of Tyndareus, when he slew that champion. Wherefore whatever  requital I am now able to pay, gladly will I pay it, for that is the  rule for weaker men when the stronger begin to help them. So with you  all, and in your company, I bid Dascylus my son follow; and if he goes,  you will find all men friendly that ye meet on your way through the sea  even to the mouth of the river Thermodon. And besides that, to the sons  of Tyndareus will I raise a lofty temple on the Acherusian height,  which all sailors shall mark far across the sea and shall reverence; and  hereafter for them will I set apart outside the city, as for gods, some  fertile fields of the well-tilled plain.\"    (ll. 811-814) Thus all day long they revelled at the banquet. But at  dawn they hied down to the ship in haste; and with them went Lycus  himself, when he had given them countless gifts to bear away; and with  them he sent forth his son from his home.    (ll. 815-834) And here his destined fate smote Idmon, son of Abas,  skilled in soothsaying; but not at all did his soothsaying save him, for  necessity drew him on to death. For in the mead of the reedy river there  lay, cooling his flanks and huge belly in the mud, a white-tusked boar,  a deadly monster, whom even the nymphs of the marsh dreaded, and no man  knew it; but all alone he was feeding in the wide fell. But the son of  Abas was passing along the raised banks of the muddy river, and the boar  from some unseen lair leapt out of the reed-bed, and charging gashed his  thigh and severed in twain the sinews and the bone. And with a sharp cry  the hero fell to the ground; and as he was struck his comrades flocked  together with answering cry. And quickly Peleus with his hunting spear  aimed at the murderous boar as he fled back into the fen; and again  he turned and charged; but Idas wounded him, and with a roar he fell  impaled upon the sharp spear. And the boar they left on the ground just  as he had fallen there; but Idmon, now at the last gasp, his comrades  bore to the ship in sorrow of heart, and he died in his comrades' arms.    (ll. 835-850) And here they stayed from taking thought for their  voyaging and abode in grief for the burial of their dead friend. And  for three whole days they lamented; and on the next they buried him with  full honours, and the people and King Lycus himself took part in the  funeral rites; and, as is the due of the departed, they slaughtered  countless sheep at his tomb. And so a barrow to this hero was raised in  that land, and there stands a token for men of later days to see,  the trunk of a wild olive tree, such as ships are built of; and it  flourishes with its green leaves a little below the Acherusian headland.  And if at the bidding of the Muses I must tell this tale outright,  Phoebus strictly commanded the Boeotians and Nisaeans to worship him as  guardian of their city, and to build their city round the trunk of the  ancient wild olive; but they, instead of the god-fearing Aeolid Idmon,  at this day honour Agamestor.    (ll. 851-868) Who was the next that died? For then a second time the  heroes heaped up a barrow for a comrade dead. For still are to be seen  two monuments of those heroes. The tale goes that Tiphys son of Hagnias  died; nor was it his destiny thereafter to sail any further. But him  there on the spot a short sickness laid to rest far from his native  land, when the company had paid due honours to the dead son of Abas. And  at the cruel woe they were seized with unbearable grief. For when  with due honours they had buried him also hard by the seer, they cast  themselves down in helplessness on the sea-shore silently, closely  wrapped up, and took no thought for meat or drink; and their spirit  drooped in grief, for all hope of return was gone. And in their sorrow  they would have stayed from going further had not Hera kindled exceeding  courage in Ancaeus, whom near the waters of Imbrasus Astypalaea bore to  Poseidon; for especially was he skilled in steering and eagerly did he  address Peleus:    (ll. 869-877) \"Son of Aeacus, is it well for us to give up our toils and  linger on in a strange land? Not so much for my prowess in war did Jason  take me with him in quest of the fleece, far from Parthenia, as for  my knowledge of ships. Wherefore, I pray, let there be no fear for the  ship. And so there are here other men of skill, of whom none will harm  our voyaging, whomsoever we set at the helm. But quickly tell forth all  this and boldly urge them to call to mind their task.\"    (ll. 878-884) Thus he spake; and Peleus' soul was stirred with gladness,  and straightway he spake in the midst of all: \"My friends, why do we  thus cherish a bootless grief like this? For those two have perished by  the fate they have met with; but among our host are steersmen yet, and  many a one. Wherefore let us not delay our attempt, but rouse yourselves  to the work and cast away your griefs.\"    (ll. 885-893) And him in reply Aeson's son addressed with helpless  words: \"Son of Aeacus, where are these steersmen of thine? For those  whom we once deemed to be men of skill, they even more than I are bowed  with vexation of heart. Wherefore I forebode an evil doom for us even as  for the dead, if it shall be our lot neither to reach the city of fell  Aeetes, nor ever again to pass beyond the rocks to the land of Hellas,  but a wretched fate will enshroud us here ingloriously till we grow old  for naught.\"    (ll. 894-898) Thus he spake, but Ancaeus quickly undertook to guide the  swift ship; for he was stirred by the impulse of the goddess. And after  him Erginus and Nauplius and Euphemus started up, eager to steer.  But the others held them back, and many of his comrades granted it to  Ancaeus.    (ll. 899-910) So on the twelfth day they went aboard at dawn, for a  strong breeze of westerly wind was blowing. And quickly with the oars  they passed out through the river Acheron and, trusting to the wind,  shook out their sails, and with canvas spread far and wide they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#14)"],[1,"among themselves, just as if they  had already taken possession of it. Covetousness is a bad thing. But it  did not turn out as they expected; for vigorous defence was made. Much  that a fool plans is not executed, and many a man misses what he thinks  to obtain. So it befell them in this attack. One said that he would  take the maid or lose his life in the attempt; and another said that the  dappled steed shall be his, and that he will be satisfied with that. The  third said that he would take the black horse. \"And the white one for  me,\" said the fourth. The fifth was not at all backward, and vowed that  he would have the horse and arms of the knight himself. He wished to win  them by himself, and would fain attack him first, if they would give him  leave: and they willingly gave consent. Then he leaves them and rides  ahead on a good and nimble steed. Erec saw him, but made pretence that  he did not yet notice him. When Enide saw them, her heart jumped with  fear and great dismay. \"Alas!\" said she, \"I know not what to say or do;  for my lord severely threatens me, and says that he will punish me, if  I speak a word to him. But if my lord were dead now, there would be no  comfort for me. I should be killed and roughly treated. God! my lord  does not see them! Why, then, do I hesitate, crazed as I am? I am indeed  too chary of my words, when I have not already spoken to him. I know  well enough that those who are coming yonder are intent upon some wicked  deed. And God! how shall I speak to him? He will kill me. Well, let him  kill me! Yet I will not fail to speak to him.\" Then she softly calls  him: \"Sire!\" \"What?\" says he, \"what do you want?\" \"Your pardon, sire. I  want to tell you that five knights have emerged from yonder thicket, of  whom I am in mortal fear. Having noticed them, I am of the opinion that  they intend to fight with you. Four of them have stayed behind, and the  other comes toward you as fast as his steed can carry him. I am afraid  every moment lest he will strike you. 'Tis true, the four have stayed  behind; but still they are not far away, and will quickly aid him,  if need arise.\" Erec replies: \"You had an evil thought, when you  transgressed my command--a thing which I had forbidden you. And yet I  knew all the time that you did not hold me in esteem. Your service has  been ill employed; for it has not awakened my gratitude, but rather  kindled the more my ire. I have told you that once, and I say it again.  This once again I will pardon you; but another time restrain yourself,  and do not again turn around to watch me: for in doing so you would  be very foolish. I do not relish your words.\" Then he spurs across the  field toward his adversary, and they come together. Each seeks out and  assails the other. Erec strikes him with such force that his shield  flies from his neck, and thus he breaks his collar-bone. His stirrups  break, and he falls without the strength to rise again, for he was badly  bruised and wounded. One of the others then appeared, and they attack  each other fiercely. Without difficulty Erec thrusts the sharp and well  forged steel into his neck beneath the chin, severing thus the bones  and nerves. At the back of his neck the blade protrudes, and the hot red  blood flows down on both sides from the wound. He yields his spirit, and  his heart is still. The third sallies forth from his hiding-place on  the other side of a ford. Straight through the water, on he comes. Erec  spurs forward and meets him before he came out of the water, striking  him so hard that he beats down flat both rider and horse. The steed lay  upon the body long enough to drown him in the stream, and then struggled  until with difficulty he got upon his feet. Thus he conquered three of  them, when the other two thought it wise to quit the conflict and not to  strive with him. In flight they follow the stream, and Erec after them  in hot pursuit, until he strikes one upon the spine so hard that he  throws him forward upon the saddle-bow. He put all his strength into the  blow, and breaks his lance upon his body, so that the fellow fell head  foremost. Erec makes him pay dearly for the lance which he has broken  on him, and drew his sword from the scabbard. The fellow unwisely  straightened up; for Erec gave him three such strokes that he slaked his  sword's thirst in his blood. He severs the shoulder from his body, so  that it fell down on the ground. Then, with sword drawn, he attacked the  other, as he sought to escape without company or escort. When he sees  Erec pursuing him, he is so afraid that he knows not what to do: he does  not dare to face him, and cannot turn aside; he has to leave his horse,  for he has no more trust in him. He throws away his shield and lance,  and slips from his horse to earth. When he saw him on his feet, Erec  no longer cared to pursue him, but he stooped over for the lance, not  wishing to leave that, because of his own which had been broken. He  carries off his lance and goes away, not leaving the horses behind: he  catches all five of them and leads them off. Enide had hard work to  lead them all; for he hands over all five of them to her with the other  three, and commands her to go along smartly, and to keep from addressing  him in order that no evil or harm may come to her. So not a word does  she reply, but rather keeps silence; and thus they go, leading with them  all the eight horses.    (Vv. 3086-3208.) They rode till nightfall without coming to any town or  shelter. When night came on, they took refuge beneath a tree in an open  field. Erec bids his lady sleep, and he will watch. She replies that she  will not, for it is not right, and she does not wish to do so. It is  for him to sleep who is more weary. Well pleased at this, Erec accedes.  Beneath his head he placed his shield, and the lady took her cloak, and  stretched it over him from head to foot. Thus, he slept and she kept  watch, never dozing the whole night, but holding tight in her hand by  the bridle the horses until the morning broke; and much she blamed and  reproached herself for the words which she had uttered, and said that  she acted badly, and was not half so ill-treated as she deserved to be.  \"Alas,\" said she, \"in what an evil hour have I witnessed my pride and  presumption! I might have known without doubt that there was no knight  better than, or so good as, my lord. I knew it well enough before, but  now I know it better. For I have seen with my own eyes how he has not  quailed before three or even five armed men. A plague for ever upon  my tongue for having uttered such pride and insult as now compel me  to suffer shame!\" All night long she thus lamented until the morning  dawned. Erec rises early, and again they take the road, she in front and  he behind. At noon a squire met them in a little valley, accompanied  by two fellows who were carrying cakes and wine and some rich autumn  cheeses to those who were mowing the hay in the meadows belonging to  Count Galoain. The squire was a clever fellow, and when he saw Erec and  Enide, who were coming from the direction of the woods, he perceived  that they must have spent the night in the forest and had had nothing to  eat or drink; for within a radius of a day's journey there was no town,  city or tower, no strong place or abbey, hospice or place of refuge. So  he formed an honest purpose and turned his steps toward them, saluting  them politely and saving: \"Sire, I presume that you have had a hard  experience last night. I am sure you have had no sleep and have spent  the night in these woods. I offer you some of this white cake, if it  please you to partake of it. I say it not in hope of reward: for I ask  and demand nothing of you. The cakes are made of good wheat; I have good  wine and rich cheeses, too, a white cloth and fine jugs. If you feel  like taking lunch, you need not seek any farther. Beneath these white  beeches, here on the greensward, you might lay off your arms and rest  yourself a while. My advice is that you dismount.\" Erec got down from  his horse and said: \"Fair gentle friend, I thank you kindly: I will eat  something, without going farther.\" The young man knew well what to do:  he helped the lady from her horse, and the boys who had come with the  squire held the steeds. Then they go and sit down in the shade. The  squire relieves Erec of his helmet, unlaces the mouth-piece from before  his face; then he spreads out the cloth before them on the thick tuff.  He passes them the cake and wine, and prepares and cuts a cheese. Hungry  as they were, they helped themselves, and gladly drank of the wine. The  squire serves them and omits no attention. When they had eaten and drunk  their fill, Erec was courteous and generous. \"Friend,\" says he, \"as a  reward, I wish to present you with one of my horses. Take the one you  like the best. And I pray it may be no hardship for you to return to the  town and make ready there a goodly lodging.\" And he replies that he  will gladly do whatever is his will. Then he goes up to the horses and,  untying them, chooses the dapple, and speaks his thanks; for this one  seems to be the best. Up he springs by the left stirrup, and leaving  them both there, he rode off to the town at top speed, where he engaged  suitable quarters. Now behold! he is back again: \"Now mount, sire,  quickly,\" says he, \"for you have a good fine lodging ready.\" Erec  mounted, and then his lady, and, as the town was hard by, they soon had  reached their lodging-place. There they were received with joy. The host  with kindness welcomed them, and with joy and gladness made generous  provision for their needs.    (Vv. 3209-3458.) When the squire had done for them all the honour that  he could do, he came and mounted his horse again, leading it off in  front of the Count's bower to the stable. The Count and three of his  vassals were leaning out of the bower, when the Count, seeing his squire  mounted"]]]
