Then there is the attack by the literal  interpretation of texts, which serves a better purpose generally in  arousing prejudice. It is difficult to realize it now, but within the  memory of the majority of those before me, the battle was raging most  fiercely in England, and both these kinds of artillery were in full play  and filling the civilized world with their roar. Less than thirty years  ago, the Rev. J. Mellor Brown was hurling at all geologists alike, and  especially at such Christian divines as Dr. Burkland, Dean Conybeare,  and Pye Smith, and such religious scholars as Professor Sedgwick, the  epithets of 'Infidel,' 'Impugner of the Sacred Record,' and 'Assailant  of the Volume of God.' His favorite weapon was the charge that these  men were 'attacking the Truth of God,' forgetting that they were simply  opposing the mistaken interpretations of J. Mellor Brown. He declared  geology 'not a subject of lawful inquiry;' he speaks of it as 'a dark  art,' as 'dangerous and disreputable,' as a 'forbidden province.' This  attempt to scare men from science having failed, various other means  were taken.    \"To say nothing about England, it is humiliating to human nature to  remember the trials to which the pettiest and narrowest of men subjected  such Christian scholars in our country as Benjamin Silliman and Edward  Hitchcock. But it is a duty and a pleasure to state here that one great  Christian scholar did honor to religion and to himself by standing  up for the claims of science despite all these clamors. That man was  Nicholas Wiseman, better known afterward as Cardinal Wiseman. The  conduct of this pillar of the Roman Catholic Church contrasts nobly with  that of timid Protestants who were filling England with shrieks and  denunciations. Perhaps the most singular attempt against geology was  that made by a fine specimen of the English Don, Dean Cockburn of York,  to _abuse_ its champions out of the field. Without apparently the  simplest elementary knowledge of geology, he opened a battery of abuse.  He gives it to the world at large by pulpit and press; he even inflicts  it upon leading statesmen by private letters. But these weapons did not  succeed. They were like Chinese gongs and dragon lanterns against rifled  cannon. Buckland, Pye Smith, Lyell, Silliman, Hitchcock, Murchison,  Agassiz, Dana, and a host of of noble champions besides, pressed on the  battle for truth was won. And was it won merely for men of science?  The whole civilized world declares that it was won for religion; that  thereby has infinitely increased the knowledge of the power and goodness  of God.\"    The lecturer classed the present opposition of the Catholics to the Free  School system in this country among the long list of battles between  science and theology and concluded his lecture as follows:    \"But, my friends, I will not weary you with so recent a chapter in the  history of the great warfare extending through the centuries. There  are cheering omens. The greatest and best men in the churches--the men  standing at centers of thought--are insisting with power, more and more,  that religion shall no longer be tied to so injurious a policy--that  searchers for truth, whether in Theology or Natural Science, shall work  on as friends, sure that, no matter how much at variance they may at  times seem to be, the truths they reach shall finally be fused into each  other. No one need fear the result. No matter whether science shall  complete her demonstration that man has been on the earth six thousand  years or six hundred thousand. No matter whether she reveal new ideas of  the Creator or startling relations between his creatures--the result,  when fully thought out, will serve and strengthen religion not less than  science. The very finger of the Almighty has written on history that  science must be studied by means proper to itself, and in no other way.  That history is before us all. No one can gainsay it. It is decisive,  for it is this: There has never been a scientific theory framed for the  use of Scriptural texts, which has been made to stand. This fact alone  shows that our wonderful volume of sacred literature was not given for  any such purpose as that to which so many earnest men have endeavored  to wrest it. The power of that volume has been mighty indeed. It has  inspired the best deeds our world has known. Despite the crusts which  men have formed about it--despite the fetters which they have placed  upon it--Christianity has blessed age after age of the past, and will go  on as a blessing through age after age of the future. Let the Warfare  of Science, then, be changed. Let it be a warfare in which religion  and science shall stand together as allies, not against each other as  enemies. Let the fight be for truth of every kind against falsehood of  every kind--for justice against injustice--for right against wrong--for  beauty against deformity--for goodness against vice--and the great  warfare which has brought so many sufferings, shall bring to the earth  God's richest blessings.\"           *       *       *       *       *          HOW FRENCH BANK NOTES ARE MADE.      When a new batch of French notes is to be printed, an equivalent number  of the choicely prepared and preserved sheets of paper is handed over  to the superintendent of the printing office. This office is among the  inner buildings of the Bank of France, and is governed by very rigorous  rules in all things. The operatives are all picked men, skillful,  active, and silent. The sheets, the ink, and the matrixes of the plates  are kept securely under lock and key until actually wanted. The  printing is effected by steam-worked presses. The ink is blue, and its  composition known only to a few of the authorities. An inspector goes  his rounds during the continuance of the operations, watching every  press, every workman, every process. A beautiful machine, distinct from  the press, is employed to print the variable numbers on the note; fed  with sheets of paper, it will number a thousand of them in succession,  changing the digits each time, and scarcely requiring to be touched  meanwhile; even the removal of one note and the placing of another are  effected by automatic agency. At every successive stage the note is  examined. So complete is the registration of everything that a record is  always at hand of the number of sheets rejected ever since the Bank of  France was established, be its defects in the paper, the printing, or  the numbering. When the master-printer has delivered up his packets of  printed and numbered sheets, each note is stamped with the signature of  the Secretary-General and the Comptroller. This completes the _creation_  of notes. The notes so created are kept in a strong box, of which the  Secretary-General and the Comptroller have keys, and are retained until  the day of _issue_. The chief cashier tells the Governor that he wants a  new supply of a particular denomination of notes, the Governor tells the  council, the council tell the secretary-general and the comptroller, and  these two functionaries open their strong box, and hand over the notes  demanded. The notes at this time are not really money; they do not  become so until the chief cashier has put his signature to each, and  registered its number in a book.    The life of a French bank note is said to average two or three  years, and does not terminate until the condition is very shaky  indeed--crimpled, pierced with pinholes, corner creases torn, soft,  tarnished, decrepit while yet young. Some have been half-burned; one has  been found half-digested in the stomach of a goat, and one boiled in a  waistcoat-pocket by a laundress. No matter; the cashier at the bank will  do his best to decipher it; he will indeed take an infinity of trouble  to put together the ashes of a burned note, and will give the owner a  new note or the value in coin, if satisfied of the integrity of the  old one. The bank authorities preserve specimens of this kind as  curiosities, minute fragments gummed in their proper position on a sheet  of paper. Very few of the notes are actually and irrevocably lost.  During the last sixty-seven years 24,000 bank notes of 1,000 francs each  have been issued, and of this number 23,958 had been returned to the  bank by the month of January 1869, leaving only 42 unaccounted for.  Whether these 42 are still in existence, or have seen burned into  uncollected ashes, or are at the bottom of the sea, or elsewhere, is not  known. Of 500-franc notes, 24,935 have been returned out of 25,000. The  bank holds itself morally and financially responsible for the small  number of notes unreturned, ready to cash them if at any time presented.    The bank sends the old notes again and again into circulation, if  verified and usable; but they are examined first, and any that are found  too defective are canceled by stamping a hole in them. These canceled  notes pass from one official to another, and are grouped in classified  bundles; the book that records the birth of each note now receives a  notification of its civil death, and after three years incarceration in  a great oak chest, a grand conflagration takes place. A huge fire is  kindled in an open court; the defunct notes are thrown into a sort of  revolving wire-cage over the fire; the cage is kept rotating; and the  minute fragments of ash, whirled out of the cage through the meshes,  take their flight into infinite space--no one knows whither. The Bank of  France prints a certain number of notes per day, and destroys a smaller  number, so as to have always in reserve a sufficient supply of new notes  to meet any emergency; but the actual burning, the grand flare-up takes  place only about once a month, when perhaps 150,000 will be burned  at once. The French go "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8997"],[0,"Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader (#14)"],[1,"the action  is expected or intended.    21. in. We say 'over.'    25. prius. Notice that Latin is here more exact than English, using the  comparative because only two actions are spoken of.    dedisset, subjunctive because indirect. Charon said _nisi dederis_  (future perfect), _nón tránsveham_, 'unless you first give (shall have  given), I will not carry you across.'    28. 1. mortuí, used as a noun, 'of the dead man.'    eó cónsilió, 'with this purpose,' 'to this end.' The clause ut ... posset  is in apposition with cónsilió.    6. Ut. Compare 27, 14.    8. quod cum fécissent, 'and when they had done this.' See the note on  _quibus_, 20, 1.    13. Stábant, 'there stood.' What is its subject?    15. mortuís, dative of indirect object.    et. Notice that ambiguity is avoided by a change of conjunctions, et  connecting the clauses and -que connecting praemia and poenás. Of these  connectives, _et_ connects two ideas that are independent of each other  and of equal importance; _-que_ denotes a close connection, often of two  words that together express a single idea; while _ac_ or _atque_ (see  line 18) adds something of greater importance.    18. et. _Multí_ is often joined by _et_ to another adjective modifying  the same noun.    24. ex. Compare 25, 18.    27. sé sociós, direct object and predicate accusative respectively.    29. 3. né. After verbs of fearing _né_ must be rendered 'that,' _ut_,  'that not.' Notice, however, that the negative idea is as clearly present  here as in the other clauses introduced by _né_ that we have met, for  Charon wishes that the thing may not happen.    13. fécisset, indirect for _féceris_.    18. refúgerit. See the note on 19, 22.    23. quae cum ita essent, 'and this being the case,' 'and so,' literally  'since which things were so.'    24. líberátus. See the note on _írá ... interfécit_, 18, 4.    25. quae, object of perscríbere, which is the subject of est; longum is  predicate adjective.    26. est. We say 'would be.'    aetáte, ablative of specification. Translate 'when he was now advanced in  age' (_i.e_. 'late in life'), and see the note on _fessus_, 23, 15.    30. 1. accidit. This is one of several impersonal verbs which take for  their subject a clause of result (ut ... occíderit).    3. ut ... íret, a clause of result; used as the subject of esset, mós  being predicate.    quis. After _sí, nisi, né_, and _num_, this is not the interrogative, but  an indefinite pronoun ('any one'),    occídisset, indirect for _occíderit_, which would be the form used in the  laws; or it may be explained as subjunctive by attraction to íret.    7. tránseant, not 'they are crossing,' but 'they are to cross.' The  direct form would be _tránseámus ('How in the world are we to get  across?'), subjunctive because the question expresses doubt. This is  called the deliberative subjunctive.    10. prógressus, 'after advancing.'    11. revertébátur. This verb is deponent in the present, imperfect, and  future.    16. humí, locative, 'on the ground.'    né. See the note on 23, 24.    suí ulcíscendí, 'of avenging himself.' This is called the gerundive  construction. It is regularly used instead of the gerund when the gerund  would have an accusative object (_sé ulcíscendí_). Notice that the gerund  is a verbal noun; the gerundive a verbal adjective, agreeing with its  noun like any other adjective.    17. morientis, 'of a dying man.' Compare _mortuí_, 28, 1.    18. vís, from _voló_.    20. sí ... vénerit, 'if you ever suspect him.' What is the literal  meaning? Notice that we use the present, while Latin by the use of the  future perfect indicates that the action is to precede that of the main  clause.    21. inficiés. The future indicative is sometimes used, as in English, for  the imperative.    22. nihil malí. See the note on 22, 26.    suspicáta. See the note on 25, 27.    25. Iolén, fíliam, captívam, direct object, appositive, and predicate  accusative respectively.    26. domum. See the note on _ad domum_, 3, 15.    31. 1. referret. See the note on 19, 6.    2. facerent, subjunctive by attraction. The verb of a clause dependent  upon an infinitive is put in the subjunctive when the two clauses are  closely connected in thought. We have already met this construction in  the case of dependence upon a subjunctive; see the note on 20, 2.    gerere. Compare 30, 3. Such phrases as _mós est_ may have as subject  either an infinitive or a clause of result.    3. verita. This participle is regularly rendered as present,    né. See the note on 29, 3.    4. vestem. Notice that the position of this word helps to make it clear  that it is the object of ínfécit as well as of dedit.    5. suspicáns. This does not differ appreciably in force from _suspicáta_,  30, 22.    8. exanimátus, 'beside himself.'    14. succenderent. Notice the force of the prefix _sub_ in this word and  in subdidit below.    15. inductus, 'moved.'      THE ARGONAUTS    33. 1. alter ... alter, 'one ... the other.' Remember that this word is  used to denote one of two given persons or things. We have in this  passage an instance of the chiastic order, in which variety and emphasis  are gained by reversing the position of the words in the second of two  similar expressions. Here the two names are brought together by this  device.    3. régní, objective genitive, _i.e_. a genitive used to denote the object  of the feeling cupiditáte.    6. ex amícís. Quídam, like _únus_, commonly has _ex_ or _dé_ and the  ablative, instead of the partitive genitive.    10. puerum mortuum esse, 'that the boy was dead,' literally 'the boy to  be dead.' This is indirect for _Puer mortuus est_, 'The boy is dead.'  Notice carefully what changes Latin makes in quoting such a statement  indirectly, and what the changes are in English. We have already met two  constructions of indirect discourse, the subjunctive in indirect  questions, and the subjunctive in informal indirect discourse. By the  latter is meant a subordinate clause which, though not forming part of a  formal quotation, has the subjunctive to show that not the speaker or  writer but some other person is responsible for the idea it expresses  (see the notes on _dedisset_, 27, 25, and _occídisset_. 30, 3). In  indirect discourse, then, a statement depending upon a verb of saying,  thinking, knowing, perceiving, or the like has its verb in the infinitive  with the subject in the accusative; a command or question has its verb in  the subjunctive; and any clause modifying such a statement, command, or  question has its verb in the subjunctive.    33. 13. intellegerent. See the note on 14, 20.    14. nesció quam fábulam, 'some story or other.' Notice that _nesció_ with  the interrogative pronoun is equivalent to an indefinite pronoun.    19. óráculum. Read again the description beginning at the bottom of  page 11.    21. quis. See the note on 30, 3.    Post paucís annís, 'a few years later,' literally 'later by a few years.'  Post is here an adverb, and paucís annís ablative of degree of  difference. The expression is equivalent to _post paucós annós_.    22. accidit. See the note on 30, 1.    factúrus, 'intending to make.' The future participle with a form of _sum_  is used to express an intended or future action. This is called the  active periphrastic conjugation.    23. certam. See the note on 5, 13.    24. Dié cónstitútá, ablative of time.    26. á pueritiá. Compare _á pueró_, 9, 20.    34. 2. tránseundó flúmine. See the note on _suí ulcíscendí_, 30, 16.    nesció quó. See the note on 33. 14.    4. únó pede núdó, 'with one foot bare,' the ablative absolute. This  construction consists of two parts, a noun, or pronoun corresponding to  the subject of a clause, and a participle corresponding to the verb of a  clause. A predicate noun or adjective may take the place of the  participle. In the latter case the use of the participle 'being' will  show the two parts in the relation of subject and predicate, 'one foot  being bare.'    34.6. démónstrávisset, subjunctive because subordinate in indirect  discourse. See the note on 33, 10. Pelias thought, _Híc est homó quem  óráculum démónstrávit_.    9. vellus aureum. Phrixus and his sister Helle were about to be put to  death, when they were rescued by a ram with fleece of gold, who carried  them off through the air. Helle fell from the ram's back into the strait  that separates Europe and Asia, called after her the Hellespont, 'Helle's  sea,' and known to us as the Dardanelles. Phrixus came safely to Colchis,  and here he sacrificed the ram and gave the fleece to Aeetes. Read Mr.  D.O.S. Lowell's _Jason's Quest_.    11. ut ... potírétur. See the note on 27, 6.    hóc vellere. _Potior_ takes the same construction as _véscor_, for which  see the note on 16, 19.    16. iter, accusative of extent.    20. úsuí, dative of purpose. We say 'of use' or 'useful.'    24. operí dative after the compound with _prae_. Notice that not all  verbs compounded with prepositions govern the dative. Many compounds of  _ad, ante, com_ (for _cum_), _in, inter, ob, post, prae, pró, sub_, and  _super_ do have the dative, and some compounds of _circum_. You will find  it profitable to keep a list of all such compound verbs governing the  dative that you meet in your reading.    25. né ... quidem, 'not ... even.' The word emphasized must stand between  _né_ and _quidem_.    ad labórem. See the note on _ad quiétem_, 14, 1.    26. Ad multitúdinem tránsportandam, used like _ad labórem_. The gerundive  in this use is very common.    27. quibus. The antecedent _eae_ is not expressed. Notice that _útor_  governs the same case as _véscor_ and _potior_. Two other deponent verbs,  not found in this book, take this construction, namely _fruor_, 'enjoy,'  and _fungor_, 'perform.'    nostró marí, _i.e_. the Mediterranean.    cónsuévimus. See the note on _cónsuéverat_, 10, 9.    35. 8. citharoedum. It was said that Orpheus made such sweet music on his  golden harp that wild beasts, trees,"]]]
