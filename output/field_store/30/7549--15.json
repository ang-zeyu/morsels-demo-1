The river had  risen still higher in the night, and it was impossible to pass through  the gorge. We now turned west-south-west, in order to strike the  tributary. Passing first over rough stony ridges, covered with  porcupine grass, we entered a sandy, thickly-bushed country, and  struck the creek in ten miles. A new range lying west I expected to be  the source of it, but it now seemed to turn too much to the south.  There was very poor grass, it being old and dry, but as the new range  to the west was too distant, we encamped, as there was water. This  watercourse was called Rudall's Creek. A cold and very dewy night made  all our packs, blankets, etc., wet and clammy; the mercury fell below  freezing point, but instantly upon the sun's appearance it went up  enormously. The horses rambled, and it was late when we reached the  western range, as our road was beset by some miles of dense scrubs.  The range was isolated, and of some elevation. As we passed along the  creek, the slight flood became slighter still; it had now nearly  ceased running. The day was one of the warmest we had yet experienced.  The creek now seemed not to come from the range, but, thinking water  might be got there so soon after rains, we travelled up to its foot.  The country was sandy, and bedecked with triodia, but near the range I  saw for the first time on this expedition a quantity of the Australian  grass-tree (Xanthorrhoea) dotting the landscape. They were of all  heights, from two to twenty feet. The country round the base of this  range is not devoid of a certain kind of wild beauty. A few blood-wood  or red gum-trees, with their brilliant green foliage, enlivened the  scene.    A small creek, lined with gum-trees, issued from an opening or glen,  up which I rode in search of water, but was perfectly unsuccessful, as  not a drop of the life-sustaining fluid was to be found. Upon  returning to impart this discouraging intelligence to my companions, I  stumbled upon a small quantity in a depression, on a broad, almost  square boulder of rock that lay in the bed of the creek. There was not  more than two quarts. As the horses had watered in the afternoon, and  as there was a quantity of a herb, much like a green vetch or small  pea, we encamped. I ascended a small eminence to the north, and with  the glasses could distinguish the creek last left, now running east  and west. I saw water gleaming in its channel, and at the junction of  the little creek we were now on; there was also water nearly east. As  the horses were feeding down the creek that way, I felt sure they  would go there and drink in the night. It is, however, very strange  whenever one wants horses to do a certain thing or feed a certain way,  they are almost sure to do just the opposite, and so it was in the  present case. On returning to camp by a circuitous route, I found in a  small rocky crevice an additional supply of water, sufficient for our  own requirements--there was nearly a bucketful--and felicity reigned  in the camp. A few cypress pines are rooted in the rocky shelving  sides of the range, which is not of such elevation as it appeared from  a distance. The highest points are not more than from 700 to 800 feet.  I collected some specimens of plants, which, however, are not peculiar  to this range. I named it Gosse's range, after Mr. Harry Gosse. The  late rains had not visited this isolated mass. It is barren and  covered with spinifex from turret to basement, wherever sufficient  soil can be found among the stones to admit of its growth.    The night of the 9th of September, like the preceding, was cold and  dewy. The horses wandered quite in the wrong direction, and it was  eleven o'clock before we got away from the camp and went north to the  sheet of water seen yesterday, where we watered the horses and  followed up the creek, as its course here appeared to be from the  west. The country was level, open, and sandy, but covered with the  widely pervading triodia (irritans). Some more Xanthorrhoea were seen,  and several small creeks joined this from the ranges to the north.  Small sheets of water were seen in the creek as we passed along, but  whether they existed before the late rains is very problematical. The  weather is evidently getting warmer. We had been following this creek  for two days; it now turned up into a confined glen in a more  northerly direction. At last its northern course was so pronounced we  had to leave it, as it evidently took its rise amongst the low hills  in that direction, which shut out any view of the higher ranges behind  them. Our road was now about west-north-west, over wretched, stony,  barren, mallee (Eucalyptus) covered low hills or stony rises; the  mallee scrub being so thick, it was difficult to drive the horses  through it. Farther on we crested the highest ground the horses had  yet passed over. From here with the glasses I fancied I saw the timber  of a creek in a valley to the north-west, in which direction we now  went, and struck the channel of a small dry watercourse, whose banks  were lined with gum-trees. When there is any water in its channel, its  flow is to the west. The creek joined another, in which, after  following it for a mile or two, I found a small pool of water, which  had evidently lain there for many months, as it was half slime, and  drying up fast. It was evident the late rains had not fallen here.    In consequence of the windings of the creeks, we travelled upon all  points of the compass, but our main course was a little west of  north-west. The day was warm enough, and when we camped we felt the  benefit of what shade the creek timber could afford. Some of the small  vetch, or pea-like plant, of which the horses are so fond, existed  here. To-day we saw a single quandong tree (Fusanus; one of the sandal  woods, but not of commerce) in full bearing, but the fruit not yet  ripe. I also saw a pretty drooping acacia, whose leaves hung in small  bunches together, giving it an elegant and pendulous appearance. This  tree grows to a height of fifty feet; and some were over a foot  through in the barrel.    The flies to-day were exceedingly troublesome: a sure sign of  increasing temperature. We saw some emus, but being continually hunted  by the natives, they were too shy to allow us to get within shot of  them. Some emu steaks would come in very handy now. Near our pool of  slime a so-called native orange tree (Capparis), of a very poor and  stunted habit, grew; and we allowed it to keep on growing.    The stars informed me, in the night, that I was almost under the  tropic line, my latitude being 23 degrees 29'. The horses fed well on  the purple vetch, their bells melodiously tinkling in the air the  whole night long. The sound of the animals' bells, in the night, is  really musical to the explorer's ear. I called the creek after Mr.  Carmichael; and hoping it would contain good water lower down, decided  to follow it, as it trended to the west. We found, however, in a few  miles, it went considerably to the south of west, when it eventually  turned up again to the north-west.    We still had the main line of mountains on our right, or north of us:  and now, to the south, another line of low hills trended up towards  them; and there is evidently a kind of gap between the two lines of  ranges, about twenty-five miles off. The country along the banks of  Carmichael's Creek was open and sandy, with plenty of old dry grass,  and not much triodia; but to the south, the latter and mallee scrub  approached somewhat near. We saw several small ponds of water as we  passed along, but none of any size. In seven or eight miles it split  into several channels, and eventually exhausted itself upon an open  grassy swamp or plain. The little plain looked bright and green. I  found some rain water, in clay pans, upon it. A clay pan is a small  area of ground, whose top soil has been washed or blown away, leaving  the hard clay exposed; and upon this surface, one, two, three, or  (scarcely) more inches of rain water may remain for some days after  rain: the longer it remains the thicker it gets, until at last it  dries in cakes which shine like tiles; these at length crumble away,  and the clay pan is swept by winds clean and ready for the next  shower. In the course of time it becomes enlarged and deepened. They  are very seldom deep enough for ducks.    The grass and herbage here were excellent. There were numerous  kangaroos and emus on the plain, but they preferred to leave us in  undisturbed possession of it. There were many evidences of native  camping places about here; and no doubt the natives look upon this  little circle as one of their happy hunting grounds. To-day I noticed  a tree in the mallee very like a Currajong tree. This being the most  agreeable and fertile little spot I had seen, we did not shift the  camp, as the horses were in clover. Our little plain is bounded on the  north by peculiar mountains; it is also fringed with scrub nearly all  round. The appearance of the northern mountains is singular,  grotesque, and very difficult to describe. There appear to be still  three distinct lines. One ends in a bluff, to the east-north-east of  the camp; another line ends in a bluff to the north-north-east; while  the third continues along the northern horizon. One point, higher than  the rest in that line, bears north 26 degrees west from camp. The  middle tier of hills is the most strange-looking; it recedes in the  distance eastwards, in almost regular steps or notches, each of them  being itself a bluff, and all overlooking a valley. The bluffs have a  circular curve, are of a red colour, and in perspective appear like a  gigantic flat stairway, only that they have an oblique tendency to the  southward, caused, I presume, by the wash of ocean currents that, at  perhaps no greatly distant geological period, must have swept over  them from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#14)"],[1,"  Twenty-five Mile Tank      1,881           500,000            3,762   Forty Mile Tank            1,546           500,000            3,092   Colreavy's Tank            2,193           997,000            2,199      The above table will give some idea of the enormous expense entailed by  the opening up of the interior. In addition to these, wells and bores were  put down, many of which failed to strike water.    Ever-thoughtful Nature has provided, on the surface of the \"granites,\"  small reservoirs which, after rain, may, in some cases, hold many hundred  gallons of water. The Rock--or Namma-holes (I presume \"Namma\" is a native  name, but of this I am uncertain) are usually more or less conical in  shape, and vary in depth from a few inches to twenty feet, and in diameter  from half a foot to several. Their sides are smooth, and slope down to a  rounded bottom, where stones are often found which would suggest that they  have had something to do with the formation of these peculiar holes.  Beneath a hard surface layer the rock becomes decomposed and comparatively  soft; and doubtless the rain of countless ages collecting round the  stones, once on the surface and now found at the bottom of the holes, has  at length weathered away the rock, and so by slow degrees the stone  has ground out an ever-increasing hollow. I am neither geologist nor  dentist, but I have often likened in my mind the formation of the  Namma-holes to the gradual hollow formed by decay in a tooth. Whatever  their history, their use is unquestionable--not so the flavour of their  contents; for every bird or beast coming to water will leave some traces  behind, and the natives, to prevent evaporation, throw in sticks, stones,  and grass. Such a collection of rubbish and filth might naturally be  supposed to render the water unhealthy, but apparently this is not the  case, for we have often been forced to drink water, which, in  civilisation would be thought only fit to be used as manure for the  garden, without any injury to health or digestion. Patient search over the  whole surface of the rock is the usual method for finding rock-holes,  though sometimes the pads of wallabies, kangaroos, or emus, may serve as a  guide to them, but game is so scarce that a man must usually trust to his  own observation. Sometimes their existence may be detected from a distance  by the patch of rock round the mouth showing white, owing to its being  worn by the feet of birds and animals.    A typical rock was the high, barren \"Cowarna,\" and one that after rain  would store in its depressions a plentiful supply of the life-giving  water. Thankful for small mercies, I made the best of a bad job, and,  having no dish or bucket from which to give Satan a drink, I was obliged  to make him lie down close to the narrow hole, whilst into his willing  throat I poured the water which at arm's length I scooped up with my  quart pot. This tedious process finished, I still had a potful at my  disposal, so, taking a long drink myself, I stripped off my clothes and  indulged in a shower bath, Not a luxurious bathe certainly, and a larger  supply would have been acceptable, but every little helps, and even a few  drops of fresh water have a pleasant effect on one's body made sticky by  the salt of the water from the lakes, and serve to remind the traveller  that he has once been clean.    Leaving the rock at sundown I travelled well into the night, for progress  was slow through the scrub and trees in the darkness, but little relieved  by the light of a waning moon. Feeling sure that I had gone far enough,  I was preparing to rest awhile and find our camp in the morning, when the  welcome glow of a fire shot up through the branches. Jim and Paddy, with  characteristic thought and resource, had climbed to the top of two tall  and dead gum trees and there built fires, fanned by the fierce draught  through the hollow trunks, knowing well at what a short distance a fire on  the ground is visible in this flat country. During my absence they had  found no gold, but, as they liked the look of the country, we decided to  return to our condensers for a fresh supply of water. Having obtained  this, Egan and I revisited our previous prospecting ground, leaving Jim  behind to \"cook\" water against our return; and a more uninteresting  occupation I cannot well picture. Camped alone on a spit of sand,  surrounded by a flat expanse of mud, broiled by the sun, half blinded by  the glare of the salt, with no shade but a blanket thrown over a rough  screen of branches, and nothing to do but to stoke up the fires, change  the water in the cooling-trough, and blow off the salt from the bottom of  the boilers, he was hardly to be envied. Yet Jim cheerfully undertook the  job and greeted us on our return, after four days, with the smiling remark  that his work had been varied by the necessity of plugging up the bottom  of one of the boilers which had burned through, with a compound (a patent  of his own) formed from strips of his shirt soaked in a stiff paste of  flour. That night we were astonished by the passage of a flight of ducks  over our heads, which Egan saw, and I and Conley heard distinctly.    A detailed account of our wanderings would be as wearying to the reader as  they were to ourselves, a mere monotonous repetition of cooking water and  hunting for \"colours\" which we never found. Christmas Eve, 1894, saw us in  the vicinity of Mount Monger, where a few men were working on an alluvial  patch and getting a little gold. A lucky storm had filled a deep clay-hole  on the flat running north-west from the hills, and here we were at last  enabled to give the camels a cheap drink; for over six weeks we had not  seen a drop of fresh water beyond what, with infinite labour, we had  condensed, with the one exception of the small rock-hole I found at  Cowarna. My entry in my journal for Christmas Day is short and sweet:  \"Xmas Day, 1894. Wash clothes. Write diary. Plot course.\" We had no  Christmas fare to make our hearts glad and but for the fortunate arrival  of my old friend David Wilson, who gave us a couple of packets of  cornflour, would have had a scanty feast indeed.    Even in the remote little mining camp Santa Claus did not forget us, and  spread his presents, in the form of a deluge of rain, on all alike. What a  pleasant change to get thoroughly wet through! The storm hardly lasted  twenty minutes, but such was its violence that every little creek and  watercourse was soon running, and water for weeks to come was secured and  plentiful in all directions; but so local is a summer storm that five  miles from the camp, no water or signs of rain were to be seen. Our  provisions being finished, nothing remained but to make all speed for  Coolgardie, some fifty miles distant by road. Unencumbered by the  condensers, which were abandoned as useless since the bottom of both  boilers had burned through, we made fair time, reaching a good  camping-ground two miles from the town on the evening of the second day,  the 30th of December.          CHAPTER III        A FRESH START      Four days sufficed to make preparations for another trip, to hear and read  the news, and write letters. My first, of course, was to my Syndicate, to  report our past movements and future plans, and how I intended making  northward, hoping that change of direction would change our luck.    January 4th we set out with the same three camels, and rations for three  months. My plan was first to revisit some known good country to the south  of Hannan's, and, if unsuccessful, to travel from that point in a more or  less north-north-west direction, and so follow, instead of crossing, the  trend of the various formations; for in travelling from east to west, or  VICE VERSA, one crosses a succession of parallel belts, first a  sand-plain, then a ridge of granite, next a timbered flat, then a stretch  of auriferous country, with possibly a belt of flat salt-lake country on  either side. Since these parallel belts run nearly north-north-west, it  seemed to the mind of the untrained geologist that by starting in a known  auriferous zone, and travelling along it in a north-north-west direction,  the chances of being all the time in auriferous country would be  increased, and the plan worth trying.    Passing the homestead of the Hampton Plains Land Company, where I was  given valuable information and a map by the courteous and kind manager,  Mr. Anderson (now alas! dead, a victim to the typhoid scourge), we  continued on the Lake Lefroy road as far as the Fourteen Mile rock-hole.  This contained water, but so foul that the camels would not look at it.  Nor were we more successful in our next water-hole, for it contained a  dead horse. Leading to this Namma-hole, which was prettily situated on a  low rock at the foot of a rough, broken ridge of granite, surrounded by  green and shady kurrajongs, we found a curious little avenue of stones.  These were piled up into heaps laid in two parallel rows, and at intervals  between the heaps would be a large boulder; evidently this was the work of  aboriginals, but what meaning to attach to it we could not think. The  beginning of our journey promised well for water, for we were again  favoured by a local thunderstorm which, in clay-pans and swamps, left a  plentiful supply. Mr. Anderson had told me of some hills in which he had  found gold in small quantities, and sure enough wherever we tried a \"dish  of dirt,\" colours were sure to result. A pleasant camp was this, plenty of  water, numberless quartz reefs, every prospect of finding payable gold,  and feed of the best kind in profusion--a welcome change for our beasts.  They were shedding the last of their winter coats, and, as the weather was  hot, I hastened the transformation by pulling off great flakes of wool  with which Egan stuffed one of the saddles. Poor Misery had an  uncomfortable experience here in consequence of catching"]]]
