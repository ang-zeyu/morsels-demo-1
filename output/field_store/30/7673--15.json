The invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a visit  promised on the afternoon of the next day.    This information excited no sober emotions in my breast. I was, of  course, eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient  intercourse. When, and where had they met? What knew he of the life and  character of this man?    In answer to my inquiries, he informed me that, three years before,  he was a traveller in Spain. He had made an excursion from Valencia to  Murviedro, with a view to inspect the remains of Roman magnificence,  scattered in the environs of that town. While traversing the scite  of the theatre of old Saguntum, he lighted upon this man, seated on a  stone, and deeply engaged in perusing the work of the deacon Marti. A  short conversation ensued, which proved the stranger to be English. They  returned to Valencia together.    His garb, aspect, and deportment, were wholly Spanish. A residence of  three years in the country, indefatigable attention to the language,  and a studious conformity with the customs of the people, had made him  indistinguishable from a native, when he chose to assume that character.  Pleyel found him to be connected, on the footing of friendship and  respect, with many eminent merchants in that city. He had embraced the  catholic religion, and adopted a Spanish name instead of his own, which  was CARWIN, and devoted himself to the literature and religion of his  new country. He pursued no profession, but subsisted on remittances from  England.    While Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin betrayed no aversion to  intercourse, and the former found no small attractions in the society of  this new acquaintance. On general topics he was highly intelligent and  communicative. He had visited every corner of Spain, and could furnish  the most accurate details respecting its ancient and present state.  On topics of religion and of his own history, previous to his  TRANSFORMATION into a Spaniard, he was invariably silent. You could  merely gather from his discourse that he was English, and that he was  well acquainted with the neighbouring countries.    His character excited considerable curiosity in this observer. It was  not easy to reconcile his conversion to the Romish faith, with those  proofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different  occasions. A suspicion was, sometimes, admitted, that his belief was  counterfeited for some political purpose. The most careful observation,  however, produced no discovery. His manners were, at all times, harmless  and inartificial, and his habits those of a lover of contemplation and  seclusion. He appeared to have contracted an affection for Pleyel, who  was not slow to return it.    My friend, after a month's residence in this city, returned into France,  and, since that period, had heard nothing concerning Carwin till his  appearance at Mettingen.    On this occasion Carwin had received Pleyel's greeting with a certain  distance and solemnity to which the latter had not been accustomed. He  had waved noticing the inquiries of Pleyel respecting his desertion  of Spain, in which he had formerly declared that it was his purpose to  spend his life. He had assiduously diverted the attention of the latter  to indifferent topics, but was still, on every theme, as eloquent and  judicious as formerly. Why he had assumed the garb of a rustic, Pleyel  was unable to conjecture. Perhaps it might be poverty, perhaps he was  swayed by motives which it was his interest to conceal, but which were  connected with consequences of the utmost moment.    Such was the sum of my friend's information. I was not sorry to be left  alone during the greater part of this day. Every employment was irksome  which did not leave me at liberty to meditate. I had now a new subject  on which to exercise my thoughts. Before evening I should be ushered  into his presence, and listen to those tones whose magical and thrilling  power I had already experienced. But with what new images would he then  be accompanied?    Carwin was an adherent to the Romish faith, yet was an Englishman by  birth, and, perhaps, a protestant by education. He had adopted Spain for  his country, and had intimated a design to spend his days there, yet now  was an inhabitant of this district, and disguised by the habiliments of  a clown! What could have obliterated the impressions of his youth, and  made him abjure his religion and his country? What subsequent events had  introduced so total a change in his plans? In withdrawing from Spain,  had he reverted to the religion of his ancestors; or was it true, that  his former conversion was deceitful, and that his conduct had been  swayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal?    Hours were consumed in revolving these ideas. My meditations were  intense; and, when the series was broken, I began to reflect with  astonishment on my situation. From the death of my parents, till the  commencement of this year, my life had been serene and blissful, beyond  the ordinary portion of humanity; but, now, my bosom was corroded by  anxiety. I was visited by dread of unknown dangers, and the future was  a scene over which clouds rolled, and thunders muttered. I compared the  cause with the effect, and they seemed disproportioned to each other.  All unaware, and in a manner which I had no power to explain, I was  pushed from my immoveable and lofty station, and cast upon a sea of  troubles.    I determined to be my brother's visitant on this evening, yet my  resolves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance. Pleyel's  insinuations that I was in love, affected, in no degree, my belief, yet  the consciousness that this was the opinion of one who would, probably,  be present at our introduction to each other, would excite all that  confusion which the passion itself is apt to produce. This would confirm  him in his error, and call forth new railleries. His mirth, when exerted  upon this topic, was the source of the bitterest vexation. Had he been  aware of its influence upon my happiness, his temper would not have  allowed him to persist; but this influence, it was my chief endeavour  to conceal. That the belief of my having bestowed my heart upon another,  produced in my friend none but ludicrous sensations, was the true cause  of my distress; but if this had been discovered by him, my distress  would have been unspeakably aggravated.        Chapter VIII      As soon as evening arrived, I performed my visit. Carwin made one of the  company, into which I was ushered. Appearances were the same as when I  before beheld him. His garb was equally negligent and rustic. I gazed  upon his countenance with new curiosity. My situation was such as to  enable me to bestow upon it a deliberate examination. Viewed at more  leisure, it lost none of its wonderful properties. I could not deny my  homage to the intelligence expressed in it, but was wholly uncertain,  whether he were an object to be dreaded or adored, and whether his  powers had been exerted to evil or to good.    He was sparing in discourse; but whatever he said was pregnant with  meaning, and uttered with rectitude of articulation, and force of  emphasis, of which I had entertained no conception previously to my  knowledge of him. Notwithstanding the uncouthness of his garb, his  manners were not unpolished. All topics were handled by him with skill,  and without pedantry or affectation. He uttered no sentiment calculated  to produce a disadvantageous impression: on the contrary, his  observations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling.  They were introduced without parade, and accompanied with that degree of  earnestness which indicates sincerity.    He parted from us not till late, refusing an invitation to spend the  night here, but readily consented to repeat his visit. His visits  were frequently repeated. Each day introduced us to a more intimate  acquaintance with his sentiments, but left us wholly in the dark,  concerning that about which we were most inquisitive. He studiously  avoided all mention of his past or present situation. Even the place of  his abode in the city he concealed from us.    Our sphere, in this respect, being somewhat limited, and the  intellectual endowments of this man being indisputably great, his  deportment was more diligently marked, and copiously commented on by  us, than you, perhaps, will think the circumstances warranted. Not a  gesture, or glance, or accent, that was not, in our private assemblies,  discussed, and inferences deduced from it. It may well be thought that  he modelled his behaviour by an uncommon standard, when, with all our  opportunities and accuracy of observation, we were able, for a long  time, to gather no satisfactory information. He afforded us no ground on  which to build even a plausible conjecture.    There is a degree of familiarity which takes place between constant  associates, that justifies the negligence of many rules of which, in  an earlier period of their intercourse, politeness requires the exact  observance. Inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are  prompted by a disinterested concern for our welfare; and this solicitude  is not only pardonable, but may justly be demanded from those who chuse  us for their companions. This state of things was more slow to arrive  on this occasion than on most others, on account of the gravity and  loftiness of this man's behaviour.    Pleyel, however, began, at length, to employ regular means for this end.  He occasionally alluded to the circumstances in which they had formerly  met, and remarked the incongruousness between the religion and habits  of a Spaniard, with those of a native of Britain. He expressed  his astonishment at meeting our guest in this corner of the globe,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#14)"],[1,"the Fine Arts.  Seventy coarse colored engravings, glazed and framed, were suspended on  the wall; and, what was most curious, nearly all of them were copies of  the same print, a portrait of King William the Fourth.    It is to be desired that some missionary should give an account of the  degree and kind of natural religion among the native tribes. Their belief  in the efficacy of sassy-wood to discover guilt or innocence, indicates a  faith in an invisible Equity. Some of them, however, select the most  ridiculous of animals, the monkey, as their visible symbol of the Deity;  or, as appears more probable, they stand in spiritual awe of him, from an  idea that the souls of the dead are again embodied in this shape. Under  this impression, they pay a kind of worship to the monkey, and never kill  him near a burial-place; and though, in other situations, they kill and  eat him, they endeavor to propitiate his favor by respectful language, and  the use of charms. Other natives, in the neighborhood of Gaboon, worship  the shark, and throw slaves to him to be devoured.    On the whole, their morality is superior to their religion--at least, as  between members of the same tribe--although they scarcely seem to  acknowledge moral obligations in respect to strangers. Their landmarks,  for instance, are held sacred among the individuals of a tribe. A father  takes his son, and points out the \"stake and stones\" which mark the  boundary between him and his neighbor. There needs no other registry. Land  passes from sire to son, and is sold and bought with as undisputed and  secure a title as all our deeds and formalities can establish. But,  between different tribes, wars frequently arise on disputed boundary  questions, and in consequence of encroachments made by either party.  \"Land-palavers\" and \"Women-palavers\" are the great causes of war. Veracity  seems to be the virtue most indiscriminately practised, as well towards  the stranger as the brother. The natives are cautious as to the accuracy  of the stories which they promulgate, and seldom make a stronger  asseveration than \"I tink he be true!\" Yet their consciences do not shrink  from the use of falsehood and artifice, where these appear expedient.    The natives are not insensible to the advantages of education. They are  fond of having their children in the families of colonists, where they  learn English, and the manners of civilized life, and get plenty to eat.  Probably the parents hope, in this way, to endow their offspring with some  of the advantages which they suppose the white man to possess over the  colored race. So sensible are they of their own inferiority, that if a  person looks sternly in the face of a native, when about to be attacked by  him, and calls out to him loudly, the chances are ten to one that the  native runs away. This effect is analogous to that which the eye of man is  said to exert on the fiercest of savage beasts. The same involuntary and  sad acknowledgment of a lower order of being appears in their whole  intercourse with the whites. Yet such self-abasement is scarcely just; for  the slave-traders, who constitute the specimens of civilized man with whom  the natives have hitherto been most familiar, are by no means on a par  with themselves, in a moral point of view. It is a pity to see such awful  homage rendered to the mere intellect, apart from truth and goodness.    It is a redeeming trait of the native character, so far as it goes, that  women are not wholly without influence in the public councils. If, when a  tribe is debating the expediency of going to war, the women come beneath  the council-tree, and represent the evils that will result, their opinion  will have great weight, and may probably turn the scale in favor of peace.  On the other hand, if the women express a wish that they were men, in  order that they might go to war, the warriors declare for it at once. It  is to be feared, that there is an innate fierceness even in the gentler  sex, which makes them as likely to give their voices for war as for peace.  It is a feminine office and privilege, on the African coast, to torture  prisoners taken in war, by sticking thorns in their flesh, and in various  other modes, before they are put to death. The unfortunate Captain Farwell  underwent three hours of torture, at the hands of the women and children.  So, likewise, did the mate of Captain Burke's vessel, at Sinoe.    The natives are very cruel in their fights, and spare neither age nor sex;  they kill the women and female children, lest they should be the mothers  of future warriors, and the boys, lest they should fight hereafter. If  they take prisoners, it is either to torture them to death, or to sell  them as slaves. The Fishmen have often evinced courage and obstinacy in  war, as was the case in their assaults upon the Liberian settlers, in the  heroic age of the colony, when Ashman and his associates displayed such  warlike ability in defeating them. The Bushmen are as cruel as the former,  but appear to be more cowardly. I have heard the Rev. Mr. Brown, himself  an actor in the scene, relate the story of the fight at Heddington, in  which three colonists, assisted by two women, were attacked at daybreak by  five hundred natives, many of whom were armed with muskets. Zion Harris  and Mr. Demery were the marksmen, while the clergyman assumed the duty of  loading the guns. The natives rushed onward in so dense a crowd, that  almost every bullet and buckshot of the defenders hit its man. The  besieged had but six muskets, one hundred cartridges, and a few charges of  powder. Their external fortifications consisted only of a slight  picket-fence, which might have been thrown down in an instant. But,  fortunately, when there were but three charges of powder left in the  house, a shot killed Gotorap, the chief of the assailants, at whose fall  the whole army fled in dismay. One of the trophies of their defeat was the  kettle which they had brought for the purpose of cooking the missionaries,  and holding a cannibal feast. The battle-field is poetically termed the  bed of honor: but the bravest man might be excused for shrinking from a  burial in his enemy's stomach! Poetry can make nothing of such a fate.    Rude and wretched as is the condition of the natives, it has been affirmed  that many of the Liberian colonists have mingled with them, and preferred  their savage mode of life to the habits of civilisation. Only one instance  of the kind has come to my personal knowledge. We had on board, for two or  three months, a party of Kroomen, among whom was one, dressed like the  rest, but speaking better English. Being questioned, he said that he had  learned English on board of merchant-vessels, where he had been employed  for several years. We took this young man into the ward-room, where he  worked for three months, associating chiefly with the Kroomen on deck,  speaking their language, and perfectly resembling them in his appearance  and general habits. About the time of discharging him, we discovered that  he was a native of North Carolina, had resided many years in Liberia, but,  being idle and vicious, had finally given up the civilized for the savage  state. His real name was Elijah Park; his assumed one, William Henry.          CHAPTER VIII.    Palaver at Sinoe--Ejectment of a Horde of Fishmen--Palaver at Settra  Kroo--Mrs. Sawyer--Objections to the Marriage of Missionaries--A  Centipede--Arrival at Cape Palmas--Rescue of the Sassy Wood-Drinker  Hostilities between the Natives and Colonists.       _November_ 27.--At Sinoe. The settlement here is in a poor condition.  The inhabitants are apparently more ignorant and lazy than the colonists  on any other part of the coast. Yet they have a beautiful and fertile  situation.    28.--The Macedonian and Decatur arrived. Governor Roberts, and other  persons of authority and distinction among the colonists, were passengers,  in order to be present at the intended palaver.    29.--At 9 A.M., thirteen boats left the different ships, armed, and having  about seventy-five marines on board, besides the sailors. Entering the  river, with flags flying and muskets glittering, the boats lay on their  oars until all were in a line, and then pulled at once for the beach, as  if about to charge a hostile battery. The manoeuvre was handsomely  executed, and seemed to give great satisfaction to some thirty colonists  and fifty naked natives, who were assembled on the beach. The officers and  marines were landed, and formed in line, under the direction of Lieutenant  Rich. The music then struck up, while the Commodore and Governor Roberts  slept ashore, and the whole detachment marched to the palaver-house,  which, on this occasion, was the Methodist Church.    The Commodore seated himself behind a small table, which was covered with  a napkin. The officers, with Governor Roberts and Doctor Day, occupied  seats on his right, and the native chiefs, as they dropped in, found  places on the left. If the latter fell short of us in outward pomp and  martial array, they had certainly the advantage of rank, there being about  twenty kings and headmen of the tribes among them. Governor Roberts opened  the palaver in the Commodore's name, informing the assembled chiefs, that  he had come to talk to them about the slaughter of the mate and cook,  belonging to Captain Burke's vessel. Jim Davis, who conducted the palaver  on the part of the natives, professed to know nothing of the matter, the  chiefs present being Bushmen, whereas the party concerned were Fishmen.  After a little exhibition of diplomacy, Davis retired, and Prince Tom came  forward and submitted to an examination. His father is king of the tribe  of Fishmen, implicated in the killing of the two men. The prince denied  any personal knowledge on the subject, but observed that the deed had been  done in war, and that the tribe were not responsible. When asked where"]]]
