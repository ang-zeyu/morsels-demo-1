I loved him just as much while he was  whipping me as I did before he began and after he stopped.    At any rate, my little knife was gone for sure.  But a few weeks  later, I dreamed one night that I found another knife, just about  like the first one.  And, as before, I dreamed I found it by the  fence at the end of our cotton rows.  I dreamed I put the knife  in my pocket.  The next morning when I woke up, I went and  searched my pockets, but the knife wasn't there.    A few weeks later I dreamed of finding still another pocket  knife.  And I dreamed that I remembered having dreamed of finding  the first one but had lost it by putting it in my pocket instead  of holding onto it.  So this time I clutched it tightly in my  hand.  This time, I reasoned, it could not possibly get away from  me, even though I seemed to know I was dreaming.  I felt sure  there just had to be a way to pass from asleep to awake and bring  that knife with me.  But when I woke up, I was disappointed again  and had to conclude that it just couldn't be done.    After that decision, I began putting my dreams to better use.  When I dreamed a dream, and I seemed to realize that I was  dreaming, I would do things to entertain other kids--things no  one else could do, like sliding down the roof of a big barn,  dropping off the edge, and just before I hit the ground, I would  close my eyes so the fall wouldn't hurt me.    At other times I would tease a vicious bull until he would chase  after me, and just before he hit me I would laugh at him and  close my eyes.  He couldn't even find me, let alone hurt me.  Often I would open my eyes and get him to charge again, only to  lose me and miss me when I closed my eyes.    Our youngest son is named Larry.  And after he was a grown man, I  dreamed that he and I were going some place in a Model T Ford car  on a highway in Texas.  It had been raining for weeks and was  still raining.  The highway was muddy and the ruts were so deep  our axles were dragging.  We were wet, cold, tired, and stuck in  a mud hole.  Then the truth came to me.  I got in the car and  called to Larry to get in out of the rain and take it easy.  He  was puzzled, but he got in the car, sat down, and asked, \"Why?\"    I told him, \"Relax and rest, I'll wake up in a few minutes and  everything will be all right.  I'm dreaming all this.  We're not  stuck out here in the mud.  It's not raining on us.  There are no  unpaved highways in Texas and no Model T cars on them.  I'm  dreaming that you are out here in this wet and cold with me.  You  are not really here.  You can't even hear me talking to you.  You  are lying up somewhere in a nice warm bed.  Come to think of it,  so am I.\"    I woke up sometime later and found things to be just the way I  had described them to Larry in my dream.    Another time I dreamed that Ima, my wife, and I were touring in  the mountains.  We had stopped at a lookout point and were  looking into the valley below.  Dinosaurs were grazing down there  and walking around.  One cute little fellow, with a neck about as  long as four telephone poles, came toward us and stuck his head  up over the rock banister where I stood.  Ima had gotten scared  and ran to the car.  I called to her, \"Ima, don't be afraid.  Come back and let's pet him.  You know we're dreaming because  these things have been extinct for thousands of years.  Come on,  he won't hurt us and we'll be the only people living who ever  petted one--or even saw one.\"    In high school we were told that a long dream might take place  within a few seconds.  But I already knew it from first-hand  experience.    I was about nine years old when I had such an experience.  One  day I was riding in the back seat of our Reo car.  Papa was  driving at about his regular speed of twelve miles per hour down  a country road.  I was sleepy but still awake when we crossed Dry  Callie Creek on a noisy bridge.    Then I fell asleep and dreamed we went places and did things that  would have taken a couple of hours in real life.  When I woke up,  I thought I had slept all the way to town and almost all the way  back home.  I was disappointed because I had planned to buy some  candy while we were in town.    I looked around to see how far we were from home only to find  that we were about two hundred yards from the noisy bridge, and  were still on our way to town.          CHAPTER 6    PROSPERITY, ANIMALS, GROWING UP    We were about the luckiest kids in the world.  We always had as  much or more than the average kids in our neighborhood.  And of  course, we had each other.  But most of all, we had parents who  had the knack of teaching us how to get pleasure from working and  how to make our own fun, using a minimum of worldly goods while  doing it.    For instance, we played a game called \"Driving the Old Sow.\"  The  equipment for playing the game cost absolutely nothing.  It  consisted of one beat-up tin can and a mesquite stick for each  player.  We spent many happy hours playing the game, especially  when we had a bunch of other kids to play it with us.    Many of our playthings were not bought with a lot of money, but  were the result of our parents' ingenuity and willingness to  build things for us, as well as playing with us and teaching us  how to live more abundantly.    We were the only ones who had a merry-go-round all our own.  It  was a big one--a four-seater, big enough for grown people.  And  we had to hold on tightly or be slung off.  There was a special  seat for the smaller ones so they wouldn't get slung off.  And of  course it was propelled by boy power.    At Christmas we got our share of toys and things, and we got  candy and fruits too.  We had apples during the entire year, and  we got bananas a few times.  But we never saw oranges except at  Christmas time.    On Christmas Eve nights, before we went to bed, we placed chairs  around the living room with a name in each one.  Gifts from Santa  were never wrapped.  He put my things in the chair with my name  in it, and the others likewise.  Next morning no one was allowed  to go into the living room until all were ready to go in.    We were taught that our family should work together to make a  more abundant life for all in the family, and now I was beginning  to see families working and playing together to bring a better  life to all in the community.    The Stevens family lived about a mile from us and one day one of  the boys got married.  The whole neighborhood knew that the  newlyweds were spending the night there at his parents' home.    I was only about nine years old, and I can't remember much about  that one and only chivaree I ever attended.  In fact, I don't  think there was much to remember about it.  But when they  explained to me just how a chivaree was carried on, naturally I  wanted in on the action.  Any country kid could beat a bucket  with a stick.  And it seemed that all the little kids and big  kids and grow people were there with buckets and pans and sticks.    We waited until all the lights were out in the Stevens' house.  Then we silently surrounded the house and when the signal was  given we all marched around the house drumming up all the noise  we could make.    After a few minutes, someone came out of the house with a lighted  kerosene lantern.  Then the newlyweds came out on the porch.  I  suppose they figured we wouldn't go away until they came out.  The groom came out into the yard and said something like, \"Ah,  come on that's enough noise, leave us alone.\"  The older ones in  our bunch exchanged a few friendly words with them and then we  all told them goodnight and went home.    Like all farm families, we had animals.  And when a cow found a  new calf out in our pasture, one or the other of us kids would  claim it for our own.  We would beg, \"Papa, can I have it?\"  or,  \"Mama, can it be mine?\"  Yes, they said it could be ours.  And  so, it belonged to one of us kids.    Just about everyone of us had a calf or a colt all our own--until  it came time to sell it.  Then guess whose it became.  Papa's,  naturally.  But then, those of us who were young enough to  believe it was really ours in the first place, were young enough  to forget our loss easily.  After all, there was no harm done.  It had been ours while it was little and cute.    We had one old mare that we called Old Ribbon.  She was not only  called Old Ribbon, she was old and her name was Ribbon.  She was  gentle and slow and patient with us young ones and didn't seem to  mind if four or five of us rode her at one time.    To get up on Old Ribbon we had to lead her up beside a stump or a  tub or a wagon tongue or something else we could climb up on and  then jump on her back.    Along with her other admirable characteristics, Old Ribbon was  also smart.  When she didn't want us to climb up on her, she  would move away just far enough that, when we tried to jump on  her back, we would land on the ground between her and whatever it  was we jumped from.    If we cheated on Old Ribbon and helped each other up without her  having to get near some climbable object, she was still patient  and gentle with us.  She wouldn't pitch us off.  She didn't have  to.  She knew where there was a low-hanging limb on a tree that  she would walk under.  And when she did, there was no way anyone  could stay on her back.  What's more, there was no way we little  kids could keep her from that low limb.  If we pulled her head to  one side, she would go sideways to the limb.  Then we had a  choice--jump off or be forced off.  The one in front could hang  onto the limb; the others would all fall in a pile behind Old  Ribbon.  We soon learned it was best to bail out beforehand.    But one day, I remember, Old Ribbon gave us a little trouble.  However, I'm sure she didn't do it intentionally.

Brown (#14)"],[1," and our feet became raw. If this had been all, we might  have had less reason to complain; but when an irritated officer (not  all the officers pursued such a reprehensible course, but a few of them  did) swore at us as if we were brutes, when we were already burdened  almost beyond endurance, it is no wonder there was an impulsive desire  to retaliate. For my own part, my feelings never were so outraged,  and the desire for revenge never ran so high and wild as then. But we  cooled down, though our physical sufferings were not lessened; as we  tramped on through the sands we became so weak it was almost impossible  to keep our ankles from striking together as we walked, and our hard  and dry shoetops would cut our ankles till the blood came.

IT was but a little while after this that we left the Rio Grande del  Norte, and pressed on toward the west. One day, while passing up a  brushy canyon, my place being with the advance guard, in the rear of  the road hands, I had occasion to step into the brush by the roadside.  While there, out of sight, Col. Cooke and staff and guides came along  and stopped right opposite me, so close that I dared not move lest they  should see me. As they came up, the colonel inquired of the guides if  there were no fruit or berries that men could live on; the reply was,  no, not a thing. They were talking about some place ahead that the  guides were acquainted with. The colonel then asked if there were no  trees that had bark something like elm bark, which men could live on  for a few days; but the answer was that there was neither fruit, roots  nor bark, that the country was a barren waste.    Upon receiving this information, the colonel exclaimed, \"What can we  do?\" In response, the suggestion was that the guides did not know  unless some of the stronger men and mules were sent on a forced march  to the first place in California, where they could get a bunch of beef  cattle and meet us on the desert with them. There was some further  conversation, when it was ended by the colonel exclaiming, with a  despairing oath, \"I expect the men will starve to death!\"    The deep gloom of sadness hung over those who knew of the situation.  All of the men, however, were not informed of the gravity of the  position we were in. At that time we were drawing less than half  rations. The fresh meat we had was more like glue or jelly than beef.  The plan had been adopted of slaughtering the weak cattle first, so  that the stronger animals could travel faster. When an animal became  too weak to hold up one end of a yoke, or to carry a packsaddle, it was  slaughtered, and the flesh issued to the men. Not a scrap of the animal  would be left on the ground; the hide, intestines--all was eaten; even  the tender or soft edges of the hoofs and horns would be roasted, and  gnawed at so long as a human being possibly could draw subsistence  therefrom. Many times we were without water to wash the offal. The  bones would be carried along, broken up, and boiled and re-boiled, in  some instances as long as there could be seen a single \"bird's eye\"  (the name given to solitary spots of grease that would come to the  surface) of grease rise on the water; then each man was eager for his  share.    Sometimes cattle became so weak that men were left with them to come  up to the command after night. On one occasion, when an old ox could  not be got into camp and had to be left four or five miles back, men  were sent bright and early next morning, to bring him in. It snowed  that night, and in camp things generally were disagreeable. The ox was  brought in, slaughtered, and issued to us for rations. If any man had  failed to get his share of that white ox at that time there might have  been a row, but a fair distribution maintained peace. The place of our  camp was called White Ox Creek, and we laid by for one day to rest and  refresh ourselves.    From there we traveled over a rough country, but one that evidently  had been inhabited ages ago, for we found stone walls, pottery by the  acre, and old and dry canals--their former source of water having  disappeared. We found in a rock a deep and large hole with water  sufficient to supply the command; we secured it by drawing all night,  until everything was watered. Then we moved on, and next night camped  without water. We passed many old mines, supposed to be of silver and  copper, and there were said to be gold mines in the vicinity. Late at  night we traveled, and were on the march early the following morning.  All day we pressed forward as rapidly as possible, there being no  water, and late at night the command came to a place called Dry Lake.    That was the hardest day for me that came in the experience of the  whole journey. I had been run down so low with a severe attack of  dysentery that I could travel no longer, and laid down. My thirst was  intense, and it did not seem possible that I could live till morning.  It seemed that everyone was traveling as best he could, for the  rearguard passed me without taking any notice. Men went by, looking  like death, their mouths black, their eyes sunken till it was difficult  to recognize them. Some eyes had a staring glare, which looked as if  the monster death were close at hand. Yet the men staggered on, their  feet hitting each other, tit for tat, as one was dragged past the  other. The hopes of these men were greater than mine, for I had ceased  to march. This was the first time I had felt there was little reason to  hope that I would ever reach camp again, for I supposed that all the  men had passed me. The sun's rays faded away on the eastern mountain  tops, and the bright orb dropped beneath the western horizon. For  a moment I felt that with me the vital spark would soon sink below the  mortal horizon, as if to accompany the king of day.    Just when my hopes were flickering as does a candle when the wick has  all but burned out, there came to my ears the sound as of the tinkling  of a tin can that seemed to keep time with a soldier's step as he  marched. Gradually the sound became more distinct until its approach  was a certainty. Then my uncle, Alexander Stephens, came in sight. He  had been left to bring up an old spotted ox which had failed, and had  driven the animal into the shade of a rocky cliff, where the ox laid  down, while the driver hunted around and found a dripping of water  as it seeped from a crevice in the rock. He had quenched his thirst  and filled his canteen, resting in the meantime, then followed on the  trail, pricking the ox with his bayonet.    When Uncle Alexander Stephens came up he handed me his canteen, and the  draught of water quickly revived me. I did not think myself able to  rise to my feet, but with a little assistance I got up, and took hold  of the packsaddle. My knapsack, musket and accoutrements were lashed to  the ox, and by a final effort we reached Dry Lake camp, by halting at  short intervals along the four miles we had to travel.    Wretched, wretched indeed, was the condition of the command that night.  It is doubtful whether at any time in the long march the men suffered  more than they did then and the forty-eight hours preceding. Next  morning, at the doctor's call, many had to be helped by their comrades  to the place designated for the sick.    For myself, two men sat me upon the ground, and held me up till my time  came to be questioned. Dr. Sanderson called out, \"What is the matter  with you?\" When he received the information asked for he remarked  gruffly: \"I've a d--d great mind not to report you sick. I never saw  such a d--d set of men in my life. They will not report till d--d nigh  dead.\" I answered that it did not matter to me whether he entered me on  the sick list or not, for I could not walk. At this he said sharply.  \"Not a d--d word out of you or I'll make you walk.\"    Then he ordered the steward to give me a dose of castor oil and  laudanum, stating the quantity. The steward, William Spencer, said,  \"Isn't it a rather heavy dose?\" to which the doctor responded with a  curse, telling him to do as he was ordered. At that the dose was poured  into a teacup, filling it half full. It was given to me, the steward  saying in a low tone of voice. \"If you do not throw it up it will kill  you.\" I was assisted back to the company's wagon, and soon vomited the  medicine, but not until it had changed my countenance so much that the  lieutenant of my company, Cyrus Canfield, did not know me. He came and  ordered me out of the wagon, telling me to go to my own company. It was  sometime before he could be convinced who I really was, then remarked  that I looked so near dead that he could not believe it was I. But when  he recognized me he was very kind, and was willing to do anything he  could for my relief.    For four days I lay in a dull stupor, when that phase of the disease  was checked, and a very high fever set in. My sufferings were so  terrible that some of my messmates came into the tent, anointed me with  oil, then"]]]
