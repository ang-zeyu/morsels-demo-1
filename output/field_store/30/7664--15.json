[123]  Having received hostages from this people, he ordered the commander  of the fleet to sail round the island; for which expedition he was  furnished with sufficient force, and preceded by the terror of the  Roman name. Pie himself then led back the cavalry and infantry, marching  slowly, that he might impress a deeper awe on the newly conquered  nations; and at length distributed his troops into their  winter-quarters. The fleet, about the same time, with prosperous gales  and renown, entered the Trutulensian [124] harbor, whence, coasting all  the hither shore of Britain, it returned entire to its former station.  [125]    39. The account of these transactions, although unadorned with the pomp  of words in the letters of Agricola, was received by Domitian, as was  customary with that prince, with outward expressions of joy, but inward  anxiety. He was conscious that his late mock-triumph over Germany, [126]  in which he had exhibited purchased slaves, whose habits and hair [127]  were contrived to give them the resemblance of captives, was a subject  of derision; whereas here, a real and important victory, in which so  many thousands of the enemy were slain, was celebrated with universal  applause. His greatest dread was that the name of a private man should  be exalted above that of the prince. In vain had he silenced the  eloquence of the forum, and cast a shade upon all civil honors,  if military glory were still in possession of another. Other  accomplishments might more easily be connived at, but the talents of a  great general were truly imperial. Tortured with such anxious thoughts,  and brooding over them in secret, [128] a certain indication of some  malignant intention, he judged it most prudent for the present to  suspend his rancor, tilt the first burst of glory and the affections  of the army should remit: for Agricola still possessed the command in  Britain.    40. He therefore caused the senate to decree him triumphal ornaments,  [129]--a statue crowned with laurel, and all the other honors which  are substituted for a real triumph, together with a profusion of  complimentary expressions; and also directed an expectation to be raised  that the province of Syria, vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus,  a consular man, and usually reserved for persons of the greatest  distinction, was designed for Agricola. It was commonly believed that  one of the freedmen, who were employed in confidential services, was  despatched with the instrument appointing Agricola to the government of  Syria, with orders to deliver it if he should be still in Britain; but  that this messenger, meeting Agricola in the straits, [130] returned  directly to Domitian without so much as accosting him. [131] Whether  this was really the fact, or only a fiction founded on the genius and  character of the prince, is uncertain. Agricola, in the meantime, had  delivered the province, in peace and security, to his successor; [132]  and lest his entry into the city should be rendered too conspicuous by  the concourse and acclamations of the people, he declined the salutation  of his friends by arriving in the night; and went by night, as he was  commanded, to the palace. There, after being received with a slight  embrace, but not a word spoken, he was mingled with the servile throng.  In this situation, he endeavored to soften the glare of military  reputation, which is offensive to those who themselves live in  indolence, by the practice of virtues of a different cast. He resigned  himself to ease and tranquillity, was modest in his garb and equipage,  affable in conversation, and in public was only accompanied by one or  two of his friends; insomuch that the many, who are accustomed to form  their ideas of great men from their retinue and figure, when they beheld  Agricola, were apt to call in question his renown: few could interpret  his conduct.    41. He was frequently, during that period, accused in his absence before  Domitian, and in his absence also acquitted. The source of his danger  was not any criminal action, nor the complaint of any injured person;  but a prince hostile to virtue, and his own high reputation, and the  worst kind of enemies, eulogists. [133] For the situation of public  affairs which ensued was such as would not permit the name of Agricola  to rest in silence: so many armies in Moesia, Dacia, Germany, and  Pannonia lost through the temerity or cowardice of their generals; [134]  so many men of military character, with numerous cohorts, defeated and  taken prisoners; whilst a dubious contest was maintained, not for the  boundaries, of the empire, and the banks of the bordering rivers, [135]  but for the winter-quarters of the legions, and the possession of our  territories. In this state of things, when loss succeeded loss, and  every year was signalized by disasters and slaughters, the public voice  loudly demanded Agricola for general: every one comparing his vigor,  firmness, and experience in war, with the indolence and pusillanimity  of the others. It is certain that the ears of Domitian himself were  assailed by such discourses, while the best of his freedmen pressed him  to the choice through motives of fidelity and affection, and the  worst through envy and malignity, emotions to which he was of himself  sufficiently prone. Thus Agricola, as well by his own virtues as the  vices of others, was urged on precipitously to glory.    42. The year now arrived in which the proconsulate of Asia or Africa  must fall by lot upon Agricola; [136] and as Civica had lately been put  to death, Agricola was not unprovided with a lesson, nor Domitian with  an example. [137] Some persons, acquainted with the secret inclinations  of the emperor, came to Agricola, and inquired whether he intended to go  to his province; and first, somewhat distantly, began to commend a life  of leisure and tranquillity; then offered their services in procuring  him to be excused from the office; and at length, throwing off all  disguise, after using arguments both to persuade and intimidate him,  compelled him to accompany them to Domitian. The emperor, prepared to  dissemble, and assuming an air of stateliness, received his petition for  excuse, and suffered himself to be formally thanked [138] for granting  it, without blushing at so invidious a favor. He did not, however,  bestow on Agricola the salary [139] usually offered to a proconsul, and  which he himself had granted to others; either taking offence that it  was not requested, or feeling a consciousness that it would seem a bribe  for what he had in reality extorted by his authority. It is a principle  of human nature to hate those whom we have injured; [140] and Domitian  was constitutionally inclined to anger, which was the more difficult  to be averted, in proportion as it was the more disguised. Yet he was  softened by the temper and prudence of Agricola; who did not think it  necessary, by a contumacious spirit, or a vain ostentation of liberty,  to challenge fame or urge his fate. [141] Let those be apprised, who are  accustomed to admire every opposition to control, that even under a  bad prince men may be truly great; that submission and modesty, if  accompanied with vigor and industry, will elevate a character to a  height of public esteem equal to that which many, through abrupt and  dangerous paths, have attained, without benefit to their country, by an  ambitious death.    43. His decease was a severe affliction to his family, a grief to his  friends, and a subject of regret even to foreigners, and those who had  no personal knowledge of him. [142] The common people too, and the class  who little interest themselves about public concerns, were frequent  in their inquiries at his house during his sickness, and made him the  subject of conversation at the forum and in private circles; nor did any  person either rejoice at the news of his death, or speedily forget it.  Their commiseration was aggravated by a prevailing report that he was  taken off by poison. I cannot venture to affirm anything certain of this  matter; [143] yet, during the whole course of his illness, the principal  of the imperial freedmen and the most confidential of the physicians was  sent much more frequently than was customary with a court whose visits  were chiefly paid by messages; whether that was done out of real  solicitude, or for the purposes of state inquisition. On the day of his  decease, it is certain that accounts of his approaching dissolution were  every instant transmitted to the emperor by couriers stationed for the  purpose; and no one believed that the information, which so much pains  was taken to accelerate, could be received with regret. He put on,  however, in his countenance and demeanor, the semblance of grief: for he  was now secured from an object of hatred, and could more easily conceal  his joy than his fear. It was well known that on reading the will, in  which he was nominated co-heir [144] with the excellent wife and most  dutiful daughter of Agricola, he expressed great satisfaction, as if it  had been a voluntary testimony of honor and esteem: so blind and corrupt  had his mind been rendered by continual adulation, that he was ignorant  none but a bad prince could be nominated heir to a good father.    44. Agricola was born in the ides of June, during the third consulate of  Caius Caesar; [145] he died in his fifty-sixth year, on the tenth of  the calends of September, when Collega and Priscus were consuls. [146]  Posterity may wish to form an idea of his person. His figure was comely  rather than majestic. In his countenance there was nothing to inspire  awe; its character was gracious and engaging. You would readily have  believed him a good man, and willingly a great one. And indeed, although  he was snatched away in the midst of a vigorous age, yet if his life be  measured by his glory, it was a period of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#14)"],[1," the \"outsider\" a chance to become partners in a  common \"res publica\"--or common-wealth.    \"You want to join us,\" they said. \"Very well, go ahead and join. We  shall treat you as if you were full-fledged citizens of Rome. In return  for this privilege we expect you to fight for our city, the mother of us  all, whenever it shall be necessary.\"    The \"outsider\" appreciated this generosity and he showed his gratitude  by his unswerving loyalty.    Whenever a Greek city had been attacked, the foreign residents had moved  out as quickly as they could. Why defend something which meant nothing  to them but a temporary boarding house in which they were tolerated as  long as they paid their bills? But when the enemy was before the gates  of Rome, all the Latins rushed to her defence. It was their Mother who  was in danger. It was their true \"home\" even if they lived a hundred  miles away and had never seen the walls of the sacred Hills.    No defeat and no disaster could change this sentiment. In the beginning  of the fourth century B.C. the wild Gauls forced their way into Italy.  They had defeated the Roman army near the River Allia and had marched  upon the city. They had taken Rome and then they expected that the  people would come and sue for peace. They waited, but nothing happened.  After a short time the Gauls found themselves surrounded by a hostile  population which made it impossible for them to obtain supplies. After  seven months, hunger forced them to withdraw. The policy of Rome to  treat the \"foreigner\" on equal terms had proved a great success and Rome  stood stronger than ever before.    This short account of the early history of Rome shows you the enormous  difference between the Roman ideal of a healthy state, and that of the  ancient world which was embodied in the town of Carthage. The Romans  counted upon the cheerful and hearty co-operation between a number of  \"equal citizens.\" The Carthaginians, following the example of Egypt and  western Asia, insisted upon the unreasoning (and therefore unwilling)  obedience of \"Subjects\" and when these failed they hired professional  soldiers to do their fighting for them.    You will now understand why Carthage was bound to fear such a clever and  powerful enemy and why the plutocracy of Carthage was only too willing  to pick a quarrel that they might destroy the dangerous rival before it  was too late.    But the Carthaginians, being good business men, knew that it never  pays to rush matters. They proposed to the Romans that their respective  cities draw two circles on the map and that each town claim one of these  circles as her own \"sphere of influence\" and promise to keep out of the  other fellow's circle. The agreement was promptly made and was broken  just as promptly when both sides thought it wise to send their armies  to Sicily where a rich soil and a bad government invited foreign  interference.    The war which followed (the so-called first Punic War) lasted  twenty-four years. It was fought out on the high seas and in the  beginning it seemed that the experienced Carthaginian navy would defeat  the newly created Roman fleet. Following their ancient tactics, the  Carthaginian ships would either ram the enemy vessels or by a bold  attack from the side they would break their oars and would then kill the  sailors of the helpless vessel with their arrows and with fire balls.  But Roman engineers invented a new craft which carried a boarding bridge  across which the Roman infantrymen stormed the hostile ship. Then there  was a sudden end to Carthaginian victories. At the battle of Mylae their  fleet was badly defeated. Carthage was obliged to sue for peace, and  Sicily became part of the Roman domains.    Twenty-three years later new trouble arose. Rome (in quest of copper)  had taken the island of Sardinia. Carthage (in quest of silver)  thereupon occupied all of southern Spain. This made Carthage a direct  neighbour of the Romans. The latter did not like this at all and they  ordered their troops to cross the Pyrenees and watch the Carthaginian  army of occupation.    The stage was set for the second outbreak between the two rivals. Once  more a Greek colony was the pretext for a war. The Carthaginians were  besieging Saguntum on the east coast of Spain. The Saguntians appealed  to Rome and Rome, as usual, was willing to help. The Senate promised the  help of the Latin armies, but the preparation for this expedition took  some time, and meanwhile Saguntum had been taken and had been destroyed.  This had been done in direct opposition to the will of Rome. The Senate  decided upon war. One Roman army was to cross the African sea and make  a landing on Carthaginian soil. A second division was to keep the  Carthaginian armies occupied in Spain to prevent them from rushing  to the aid of the home town. It was an excellent plan and everybody  expected a great victory. But the Gods had decided otherwise.    It was the fall of the year 218 before the birth of Christ and the Roman  army which was to attack the Carthaginians in Spain had left Italy.  People were eagerly waiting for news of an easy and complete victory  when a terrible rumour began to spread through the plain of the Po.  Wild mountaineers, their lips trembling with fear, told of hundreds of  thousands of brown men accompanied by strange beasts \"each one as big  as a house,\" who had suddenly emerged from the clouds of snow which  surrounded the old Graian pass through which Hercules, thousands of  years before, had driven the oxen of Geryon on his way from Spain to  Greece. Soon an endless stream of bedraggled refugees appeared before  the gates of Rome, with more complete details. Hannibal, the son of  Hamilcar, with fifty thousand soldiers, nine thousand horsemen and  thirty-seven fighting elephants, had crossed the Pyrenees. He had  defeated the Roman army of Scipio on the banks of the Rhone and he had  guided his army safely across the mountain passes of the Alps although  it was October and the roads were thickly covered with snow and ice.  Then he had joined forces with the Gauls and together they had defeated  a second Roman army just before they crossed the Trebia and laid siege  to Placentia, the northern terminus of the road which connected Rome  with the province of the Alpine districts.    The Senate, surprised but calm and energetic as usual, hushed up  the news of these many defeats and sent two fresh armies to stop the  invader. Hannibal managed to surprise these troops on a narrow road  along the shores of the Trasimene Lake and there he killed all the Roman  officers and most of their men. This time there was a panic among  the people of Rome, but the Senate kept its nerve. A third army was  organised and the command was given to Quintus Fabius Maximus with full  power to act \"as was necessary to save the state.\"    Fabius knew that he must be very careful lest all be lost. His raw and  untrained men, the last available soldiers, were no match for Hannibal's  veterans. He refused to accept battle but forever he followed Hannibal,  destroyed everything eatable, destroyed the roads, attacked small  detachments and generally weakened the morale of the Carthaginian troops  by a most distressing and annoying form of guerilla warfare.    Such methods however did not satisfy the fearsome crowds who had found  safety behind the walls of Rome. They wanted \"action.\" Something must be  done and must be done quickly. A popular hero by the name of Varro, the  sort of man who went about the city telling everybody how much better  he could do things than slow old Fabius, the \"Delayer,\" was made  commander-in-chief by popular acclamation. At the battle of Cannae (216)  he suffered the most terrible defeat of Roman history. More than seventy  thousand men were killed. Hannibal was master of all Italy.    He marched from one end of the peninsula to the other, proclaiming  himself the \"deliverer from the yoke of Rome\" and asking the different  provinces to join him in warfare upon the mother city. Then once more  the wisdom of Rome bore noble fruit. With the exceptions of Capua and  Syracuse, all Roman cities remained loyal. Hannibal, the deliverer,  found himself opposed by the people whose friend he pretended to be.  He was far away from home and did not like the situation. He sent  messengers to Carthage to ask for fresh supplies and new men. Alas,  Carthage could not send him either.    The Romans with their boarding-bridges, were the masters of the sea.  Hannibal must help himself as best he could. He continued to defeat the  Roman armies that were sent out against him, but his own numbers  were decreasing rapidly and the Italian peasants held aloof from this  self-appointed \"deliverer.\"    After many years of uninterrupted victories, Hannibal found himself  besieged in the country which he had just conquered. For a moment, the  luck seemed to turn. Hasdrubal, his brother, had defeated the Roman  armies in Spain. He had crossed the Alps to come to Hannibal's  assistance. He sent messengers to the south to tell of his arrival and  ask the other army to meet him in the plain of the Tiber. Unfortunately  the messengers fell into the hands of the Romans and Hannibal waited  in vain for further news until his brother's head, neatly packed in a  basket, came rolling into his camp and told him of the fate of the last  of the Carthaginian troops.    With Hasdrubal out of the way, young Publius Scipio easily reconquered  Spain and four years later the Romans were ready for a final attack upon  Carthage. Hannibal was called back. He crossed the African Sea and tried  to organise the defences of his home-city. In the year 202 at the battle  of Zama, the Carthaginians were defeated. Hannibal fled to Tyre. From  there he went to Asia Minor to stir up the Syrians and the Macedonians  against Rome. He accomplished very little but his activities among these  Asiatic powers gave the Romans an excuse"]]]
