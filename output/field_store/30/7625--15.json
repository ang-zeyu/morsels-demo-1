I am sensitive about my honest poverty. So, darling Nutty,  my precious Nutty, you poor boneheaded muddler, will you kindly  think up at your earliest convenience some plan for politely  ejecting this Mr Chalmers of yours from our humble home?--because  if you don't, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.'    And, completely restored to good humour by her own eloquence,  Elizabeth burst out laughing. It was a trait in her character  which she had often lamented, that she could not succeed in  keeping angry with anyone for more than a few minutes on end.  Sooner or later some happy selection of a phrase of abuse would  tickle her sense of humour, or the appearance of her victim would  become too funny not to be laughed at. On the present occasion it  was the ridiculous spectacle of Nutty cowering beneath the  bedclothes that caused her wrath to evaporate. She made a weak  attempt to recover it. She glared at Nutty, who at the sound of  her laughter had emerged from under the clothes like a worm after  a thunderstorm.    'I mean it,' she said. 'It really is too bad of you! You might  have had some sense and a little consideration. Ask yourself if we  are in a position here to entertain visitors. Well, I'm going to  make myself very unpopular with this Mr Chalmers of yours. By this  evening he will be regarding me with utter loathing, for I am  about to persecute him.'    'What do you mean?' asked Nutty, alarmed.    'I am going to begin by asking him to help me open one of the  hives.'    'For goodness' sake!'    'After that I shall--with his assistance--transfer some honey. And  after that--well, I don't suppose he will be alive by then. If he  is, I shall make him wash the dishes for me. The least he can do,  after swooping down on us like this, is to make himself useful.'    A cry of protest broke from the appalled Nutty, but Elizabeth did  not hear it. She had left the room and was on her way downstairs.    Lord Dawlish was smoking an after-breakfast cigar in the grounds.  It was a beautiful day, and a peaceful happiness had come upon  him. He told himself that he had made progress. He was under the  same roof as the girl he had deprived of her inheritance, and it  should be simple to establish such friendly relations as would  enable him to reveal his identity and ask her to reconsider her  refusal to relieve him of a just share of her uncle's money. He  had seen Elizabeth for only a short time on the previous night,  but he had taken an immediate liking to her. There was something  about the American girl, he reflected, which seemed to put a man  at his ease, a charm and directness all her own. Yes, he liked  Elizabeth, and he liked this dwelling-place of hers. He was quite  willing to stay on here indefinitely.    Nature had done well by Flack's. The house itself was more  pleasing to the eye than most of the houses in those parts, owing  to the black and white paint which decorated it and an unconventional  flattening and rounding of the roof. Nature, too, had made so many  improvements that the general effect was unusually delightful.    Bill perceived Elizabeth coming toward him from the house. He  threw away his cigar and went to meet her. Seen by daylight, she  was more attractive than ever. She looked so small and neat and  wholesome, so extremely unlike Miss Daisy Leonard's friend. And  such was the reaction from what might be termed his later  Reigelheimer's mood that if he had been asked to define feminine  charm in a few words, he would have replied without hesitation  that it was the quality of being as different as possible in every  way from the Good Sport. Elizabeth fulfilled this qualification.  She was not only small and neat, but she had a soft voice to which  it was a joy to listen.    'I was just admiring your place,' he said.    'Its appearance is the best part of it,' said Elizabeth. 'It is a  deceptive place. The bay looks beautiful, but you can't bathe in  it because of the jellyfish. The woods are lovely, but you daren't  go near them because of the ticks.'    'Ticks?'    'They jump on you and suck your blood,' said Elizabeth, carelessly.  'And the nights are gorgeous, but you have to stay indoors after  dusk because of the mosquitoes.' She paused to mark the effect of  these horrors on her visitor. 'And then, of course,' she went on,  as he showed no signs of flying to the house to pack his bag and  catch the next train, 'the bees are always stinging you. I hope you  are not afraid of bees, Mr Chalmers?'    'Rather not. Jolly little chaps!'    A gleam appeared in Elizabeth's eye.    'If you are so fond of them, perhaps you wouldn't mind coming and  helping me open one of the hives?'    'Rather!'    'I'll go and fetch the things.'    She went into the house and ran up to Nutty's room, waking that  sufferer from a troubled sleep.    'Nutty, he's bitten.'    Nutty sat up violently.    'Good gracious! What by?'    'You don't understand. What I meant was that I invited your Mr  Chalmers to help me open a hive, and he said \"Rather!\" and is  waiting to do it now. Be ready to say good-bye to him. If he comes  out of this alive, his first act, after bathing the wounds with  ammonia, will be to leave us for ever.'    'But look here, he's a visitor--'    'Cheer up! He won't be much longer.'    'You can't let him in for a ghastly thing like opening a hive.  When you made me do it that time I was picking stings out of  myself for a week.'    'That was because you had been smoking. Bees dislike the smell of  tobacco.'    'But this fellow may have been smoking.'    'He has just finished a strong cigar.'    'For Heaven's sake!'    'Good-bye, Nutty, dear; I mustn't keep him waiting.'    Lord Dawlish looked with interest at the various implements which  she had collected when she rejoined him outside. He relieved her  of the stool, the smoker, the cotton-waste, the knife, the  screwdriver, and the queen-clipping cage.    'Let me carry these for you,' he said, 'unless you've hired a  van.'    Elizabeth disapproved of this flippancy. It was out of place in  one who should have been trembling at the prospect of doom.    'Don't you wear a veil for this sort of job?'    As a rule Elizabeth did. She had reached a stage of intimacy with  her bees which rendered a veil a superfluous precaution, but until  to-day she had never abandoned it. Her view of the matter was  that, though the inhabitants of the hives were familiar and  friendly with her by this time and recognized that she came among  them without hostile intent, it might well happen that among so  many thousands there might be one slow-witted enough and obtuse  enough not to have grasped this fact. And in such an event a veil  was better than any amount of explanations, for you cannot stick  to pure reason when quarrelling with bees.    But to-day it had struck her that she could hardly protect herself  in this way without offering a similar safeguard to her visitor,  and she had no wish to hedge him about with safeguards.    'Oh, no,' she said, brightly; 'I'm not afraid of a few bees. Are  you?'    'Rather not!'    'You know what to do if one of them flies at you?'    'Well, it would, anyway--what? What I mean to say is, I could  leave most of the doing to the bee.'    Elizabeth was more disapproving than ever. This was mere bravado.  She did not speak again until they reached the hives.    In the neighbourhood of the hives a vast activity prevailed. What,  heard from afar, had been a pleasant murmur became at close  quarters a menacing tumult. The air was full of bees--bees  sallying forth for honey, bees returning with honey, bees  trampling on each other's heels, bees pausing in mid-air to pass  the time of day with rivals on competing lines of traffic.  Blunt-bodied drones whizzed to and fro with a noise like miniature  high-powered automobiles, as if anxious to convey the idea of being  tremendously busy without going to the length of doing any actual  work. One of these blundered into Lord Dawlish's face, and it  pleased Elizabeth to observe that he gave a jump.    'Don't be afraid,' she said, 'it's only a drone. Drones have no  stings.'    'They have hard heads, though. Here he comes again!'    'I suppose he smells your tobacco. A drone has thirty-seven  thousand eight hundred nostrils, you know.'    'That gives him a sporting chance of smelling a cigar--what? I  mean to say, if he misses with eight hundred of his nostrils he's  apt to get it with the other thirty-seven thousand.'    Elizabeth was feeling annoyed with her bees. They resolutely  declined to sting this young man. Bees flew past him, bees flew  into him, bees settled upon his coat, bees paused questioningly in  front of him, as who should say, 'What have we here?' but not a  single bee molested him. Yet when Nutty, poor darling, went within  a dozen yards of the hives he never failed to suffer for it. In  her heart Elizabeth knew perfectly well that this was because  Nutty, when in the presence of the bees, lost his head completely  and behaved like an exaggerated version of Lady Wetherby's Dream  of Psyche, whereas Bill maintained an easy calm; but at the moment  she put the phenomenon down to that inexplicable cussedness which  does so much to exasperate the human race, and it fed her  annoyance with her unbidden guest.    Without commenting on his last remark, she took the smoker from  him and set to work. She inserted in the fire-chamber a handful of  the cotton-waste and set fire to it; then with a preliminary puff  or two of the bellows to make sure that the conflagration had not  gone out, she aimed the nozzle at the front door of the hive.    The results were instantaneous. One or two bee-policemen, who were  doing fixed point-duty near the opening, scuttled hastily back  into the hive; and from within came a muffled buzzing as other  bees, all talking at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#14)"],[1,"the no less  celebrated and learned Professor Max Muller places it as near the first  century of our era as possible.        The fair was at its culmination when, having finished visiting the  cells, climbing over all the stories, and examining the celebrated \"hall  of wrestlers,\" we descended, not by way of the stairs, of which there is  no trace to be found, but after the fashion of pails bringing water out  of a deep well, that is to say, by the aid of ropes. A crowd of about  three thousand persons had assembled from the surrounding villages and  towns. Women were there adorned from the waist down in brilliant-hued  saris, with rings in their noses, their ears, their lips, and on all  parts of their limbs that could hold a ring. Their raven-black hair  which was smoothly combed back, shone with cocoanut oil, and was adorned  with crimson flowers, which are sacred to Shiva and to Bhavani, the  feminine aspect of this god.    Before the temple there were rows of small shops and of tents, where  could be bought all the requisites for the usual sacrifices--aromatic  herbs, incense, sandal wood, rice, gulab, and the red powder with which  the pilgrim sprinkles first the idol and then his own face. Fakirs,  bairagis, hosseins, the whole body of the mendicant brotherhood, was  present among the crowd. Wreathed in chaplets, with long uncombed hair  twisted at the top of the head into a regular chignon, and with bearded  faces, they presented a very funny likeness to naked apes. Some of them  were covered with wounds and bruises due to mortification of the flesh.  We also saw some bunis, snake-charmers, with dozens of various snakes  round their waists, necks, arms, and legs--models well worthy of the  brush of a painter who intended to depict the image of a male Fury. One  jadugar was especially remarkable. His head was crowned with a turban  of cobras. Expanding their hoods and raising their leaf-like dark green  heads, these cobras hissed furiously and so loudly that the sound was  audible a hundred paces off. Their \"stings\" quivered like lightning,  and their small eyes glittered with anger at the approach of every  passer-by. The expression, \"the sting of a snake,\" is universal, but  it does not describe accurately the process of inflicting a wound. The  \"sting\" of a snake is perfectly harmless. To introduce the poison into  the blood of a man, or of an animal, the snake must pierce the flesh  with its fangs, not prick with its sting. The needle-like eye teeth of  a cobra communicate with the poison gland, and if this gland is cut out  the cobra will not live more than two days. Accordingly, the supposition  of some sceptics, that the bunis cut out this gland, is quite unfounded.  The term \"hissing\" is also inaccurate when applied to cobras. They do  not hiss. The noise they make is exactly like the death-rattle of a  dying man. The whole body of a cobra is shaken by this loud and heavy  growl.    Here we happened to be the witnesses of a fact which I relate exactly  as it occurred, without indulging in explanations or hypotheses of any  kind. I leave to naturalists the solution of the enigma.    Expecting to be well paid, the cobra-turbaned buni sent us word by a  messenger boy that he would like very much to exhibit his powers of  snake-charming. Of course we were perfectly willing, but on condition  that between us and his pupils there should be what Mr. Disraeli would  call a \"scientific frontier.\"* We selected a spot about fifteen paces  from the magic circle. I will not describe minutely the tricks and  wonders that we saw, but will proceed at once to the main fact. With the  aid of a vaguda, a kind of musical pipe of bamboo, the buni caused all  the snakes to fall into a sort of cataleptic sleep. The melody that he  played, monotonous, low, and original to the last degree, nearly sent us  to sleep ourselves. At all events we all grew extremely sleepy without  any apparent cause. We were aroused from this half lethargy by our  friend Gulab-Sing, who gathered a handful of a grass, perfectly unknown  to us, and advised us to rub our temples and eyelids with it. Then the  buni produced from a dirty bag a kind of round stone, something like a  fish's eye, or an onyx with a white spot in the centre, not bigger than  a ten-kopek bit. He declared that anyone who bought that stone would be  able to charm any cobra (it would produce no effect on snakes of other  kinds) paralyzing the creature and then causing it to fall asleep.  Moreover, by his account, this stone is the only remedy for the bite  of a cobra. You have only to place this talisman on the wound, where it  will stick so firmly that it cannot be torn off until all the poison is  absorbed into it, when it will fall off of itself, and all danger will  be past.      * Written in 1879.      Being aware that the Government gladly offers any premium for the  invention of a remedy for the bite of the cobra, we did not show any  unreasonable interest on the appearance of this stone. In the meanwhile,  the buni began to irritate his cobras. Choosing a cobra eight feet long,  he literally enraged it. Twisting its tail round a tree, the cobra arose  and hissed. The buni quietly let it bite his finger, on which we all saw  drops of blood. A unanimous cry of horror arose in the crowd. But master  buni stuck the stone on his finger and proceeded with his performance.    \"The poison gland of the snake has been cut out,\" remarked our New York  colonel. \"This is a mere farce.\"    As if in answer to this remark, the buni seized the neck of the cobra,  and, after a short struggle, fixed a match into its mouth, so that it  remained open. Then he brought the snake over and showed it to each of  us separately, so that we all saw the death-giving gland in its mouth.  But our colonel would not give up his first impression so easily. \"The  gland is in its place right enough,\" said he, \"but how are we to know  that it really does contain poison?\"    Then a live hen was brought forward and, tying its legs together, the  buni placed it beside the snake. But the latter would pay no attention  at first to this new victim, but went on hissing at the buni, who teased  and irritated it until at last it actually struck at the wretched bird.  The hen made a weak attempt to cackle, then shuddered once or twice and  became still. The death was instantaneous. Facts will remain facts, the  most exacting critic and disbeliever notwithstanding. This thought gives  me courage to write what happened further. Little by little the cobra  grew so infuriated that it became evident the jadugar himself did not  dare to approach it. As if glued to the trunk of the tree by its tail,  the snake never ceased diving into space with its upper part and trying  to bite everything. A few steps from us was somebody's dog. It seemed to  attract the whole of the buni's attention for some time. Sitting on his  haunches, as far as possible from his raging pupil, he stared at the dog  with motionless glassy eyes, and then began a scarcely audible song.  The dog grew restless. Putting his tail between his legs, he tried to  escape, but remained, as if fastened to the ground. After a few seconds  he crawled nearer and nearer to the buni, whining, but unable to tear  his gaze from the charmer. I understood his object, and felt awfully  sorry for the dog. But, to my horror, I suddenly felt that my tongue  would not move, I was perfectly unable either to get up or even to raise  my finger. Happily this fiendish scene was not prolonged. As soon as  the dog was near enough, the cobra bit him. The poor animal fell on his  back, made a few convulsive movements with his legs, and shortly died.  We could no longer doubt that there was poison in the gland. In the  meanwhile the stone had dropped from the buni's finger and he approached  to show us the healed member. We all saw the trace of the prick, a red  spot not bigger than the head of an ordinary pin.    Next he made his snakes rise on their tails, and, holding the stone  between his first finger and thumb, he proceeded to demonstrate its  influence on the cobras. The nearer his hand approached to the head of  the snake, the more the reptile's body recoiled. Looking steadfastly at  the stone they shivered, and, one by one, dropped as if paralyzed. The  buni then made straight for our sceptical colonel, and made him an offer  to try the experiment himself. We all protested vigorously, but he would  not listen to us, and chose a cobra of a very considerable size. Armed  with the stone, the colonel bravely approached the snake. For a moment  I positively felt petrified with fright. Inflating its hood, the cobra  made an attempt to fly at him, then suddenly stopped short, and, after  a pause, began following with all its body the circular movements of the  colonel's hand. When he put the stone quite close to the reptile's head,  the snake staggered as if intoxicated, its hissing grew weak, its hood  dropped helplessly on both sides of its neck, and its eyes closed.  Drooping lower and lower, the snake fell at last on the ground like a  stick, and slept.    Only then did we breathe freely. Taking the sorcerer aside we expressed  our desire to buy the stone, to which he easily assented, and, to our  great astonishment, asked for it only two rupees. This talisman became  my own property and I still keep it. The buni asserts, and our Hindu  friends confirm the story, that it is not a stone but an excrescence. It  is found in the mouth of one cobra in a hundred, between the bone of the  upper jaw and the skin of the palate. This \"stone\" is not fastened to  the skull, but hangs, wrapped in skin, from the palate, and so is very  easily cut off; but after this operation the cobra is said to die. If  we are to believe Bishu Nath, for that was our sorcerer's name, this  excrescence confers upon the cobra who possesses it the rank of king  over the rest of his kind.    \"Such a"]]]
