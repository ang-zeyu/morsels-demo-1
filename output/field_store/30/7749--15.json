A coward's eyes--a cur's face, Godwin. But you, George--have  you heard what he said?\"    No answer from George but a snarl.    \"It sounds logical what he said, eh, George?\"    Dead silence.    \"But,\" said Donnegan, \"there are flaws in the plan. Godwin, get out of  your clothes.\"    The other fell on his knees.    \"For heaven's sake,\" he pleaded.    \"Shut up,\" commanded Donnegan. \"I'm not going to shoot you. I never  intended to, you fool. But I wanted to see if you were worth splitting  the coin with. You're not. Now get out of your clothes.\"    He was obeyed in fumbling haste, and while that operation went on, he  succeeded in jumping out of his own rags and still kept the two fairly  steadily under the nose of his gun. He tossed this bundle to Godwin, who  accepted it with a faint oath; and Donnegan stepped calmly and swiftly  into the clothes of his victim.    \"A perfect fit,\" he said at length, \"and to show that I'm pleased,  here's your purse back. Must be close to two hundred in that, from the  weight.\"    Godwin muttered some unintelligible curse.    \"Tush. Now, get out! If you show your face in The Corner again, some of  those miners will spot you, and they'll dress you in tar and feathers.\"    \"You fool. If they see you in my clothes?\"    \"They'll never see these after tonight, probably. You have other clothes  in your packs, Godwin. Lots of 'em. You're the sort who knows how to  dress, and I'll borrow your outfit. Get out!\"    The other made no reply; a weight seemed to have fallen upon him along  with his new outfit, and he slunk into the darkness. George made a move  to follow; there was a muffled shriek from Godwin, who fled headlong;  and then a sharp command from Donnegan stopped the big man.    \"Come here,\" said Donnegan.    George Washington Green rode slowly closer.    \"If I let you go what would you do?\"    There was a glint of teeth.    \"I'd find him.\"    \"And break him in two, eh? Instead, I'm going to take you home, where  you'll have a chance of breaking me in two instead. There's something  about the cut of your shoulders and your head that I like, Green; and if  you don't murder me in the first hour or so, I think we'll get on very  well together. You hear?\"    The silence of George Washington Green was a tremendous thing.    \"Now ride ahead of me. I'll direct you how to go.\"    He went first straight back through the town and up the hill to the two  tents. He made George go before him into the tent and take up the roll  of bedding; and then, with George and the bedding leading the way, and  Donnegan leading the two horses behind, they went across the hillside to  a shack which he had seen vacated that evening. It certainly could not  be rented again before morning, and in the meantime Donnegan would be in  possession, which was a large part of the law in The Corner, as he knew.    A little lean-to against the main shack served as a stable; the creek  down the hillside was the watering trough. And Donnegan stood by while  the big Negro silently tended to the horses--removing the packs and  preparing them for the night. Still in silence he produced a small  lantern and lighted it. It showed his face for the first time--the skin  ebony black and polished over the cheekbones, but the rest of the face  almost handsome, except that the slight flare of his nostrils gave him a  cast of inhuman ferocity. And the fierceness was given point by a pair  of arms of gorilla length; broad shoulders padded with rolling muscles,  and the neck of a bull. On the whole, Donnegan, a connoisseur of  fighting men, had never seen such promise of strength.    At his gesture, George led the way into the house. It was more  commodious than most of the shacks of The Corner. In place of a single  room this had two compartments--one for the kitchen and another for the  living room. In vacating the hut, the last occupants had left some of  the furnishings behind them. There was a mirror, for instance, in the  corner; and beneath the mirror a cheap table in whose open drawer  appeared a tumble of papers. Donnegan dropped the heavy sack of Godwin's  winnings to the floor, and while George hung the lantern on a nail on  the wall, Donnegan crossed to the table and appeared to run through the  papers.    He was humming carelessly while he did it, but all the time he watched  with catlike intensity the reflection of George in the mirror above him.  He saw--rather dimly, for the cheap glass showed all its images in  waves--that George turned abruptly after hanging up the lantern, paused,  and then whipped a hand into his coat pocket and out again.    Donnegan leaped lightly to one side, and the knife, hissing past his  head, buried itself in the wall, and its vibrations set up a vicious  humming. As for Donnegan, the leap that carried him to one side whirled  him about also; he faced the big man, who was now crouched in the very  act of following the knife cast with the lunge of his powerful body.  There was no weapon in Donnegan's hand, and yet George hesitated,  balanced--and then slowly drew himself erect.    He was puzzled. An outburst of oaths, the flash of a gun, and he would  have been at home in the brawl, but the silence, the smile of Donnegan  and the steady glance were too much for him. He moistened his lips, and  yet he could not speak. And Donnegan knew that what paralyzed George was  the manner in which he had received warning. Evidently the simple  explanation of the mirror did not occur to the fellow; and the whole  incident took on supernatural colorings. A phrase of explanation and  Donnegan would become again an ordinary human being; but while the small  link was a mystery the brain and body of George were numb. It was  necessary above all to continue inexplicable. Donnegan, turning, drew  the knife from the wall with a jerk. Half the length of the keen blade  had sunk into the wood--a mute tribute to the force and speed of  George's hand--and now Donnegan took the bright little weapon by the  point and gave it back to the other.    \"If you throw for the body instead of the head,\" said Donnegan, \"you  have a better chance of sending the point home.\"    He turned his back again upon the gaping giant, and drawing up a broken  box before the open door he sat down to contemplate the night. Not a  sound behind him. It might be that the big fellow had regained his nerve  and was stealing up for a second attempt; but Donnegan would have  wagered his soul that George Washington Green had his first and last  lesson and that he would rather play with bare lightning than ever again  cross his new master.    At length: \"When you make down the bunks,\" said Donnegan, \"put mine  farthest from the kitchen. You had better do that first.\"    \"Yes--sir,\" came the deep bass murmur behind him.    And the heart of Donnegan stirred, for that \"sir\" meant many things.    Presently George crossed the floor with a burden; there was the \"whish\"  of the blankets being unrolled--and then a slight pause. It seemed to  him that he could hear a heavier breathing. Why? And searching swiftly  back through his memory he recalled that his other gun, a stub-nosed  thirty-eight, was in the center of his blanket roll.    And he knew that George had the weapon in his big hand. One pressure of  the trigger would put an end to Donnegan; one bullet would give George  the canvas sack and its small treasure.    \"When you clean my gun,\" said Donnegan, \"take the action to pieces and  go over every part.\"    He could actually feel the start of George.    Then: \"Yes, sir,\" in a subdued whisper.    If the escape from the knife had startled George, this second incident  had convinced him that his new master possessed eyes in the back of his  head.    And Donnegan, paying no further heed to him, looked steadily across the  hillside to the white tent of Lou Macon, fifty yards away.          16      His plan, grown to full stature so swiftly, and springing out of  nothing, well nigh, had come out of his first determination to bring  Jack Landis back to Lou Macon; for he could interpret those blank, misty  eyes with which she had sat after the departure of Landis in only one  way. Yet to rule even the hand of big Jack Landis would be hard enough  and to rule his heart was quite another story. Remembering Nelly Lebrun,  he saw clearly that the only way in which he could be brought back to  Lou was first to remove Nelly as a possibility in his eyes. But how  remove Nelly as long as it was her cue from her father to play Landis  for his money? How remove her, unless it were possible to sweep Nelly  off her feet with another man? She might, indeed, be taken by storm, and  if she once slighted Landis for the sake of another, his boyish pride  would probably do the rest, and his next step would be to return to Lou  Macon.    All this seemed logical, but where find the man to storm the heart of  Nelly and dazzle her bright, clever eyes? His own rags had made him  shrug his shoulders; and it was the thought of clothes which had made  him fasten his attention so closely on the man of the linen suit in  Lebrun's. Donnegan with money, with well-fitted clothes, and with a few  notorious escapades behind him--yes, Donnegan with such a flying start  might flutter the heart of Nelly Lebrun for a moment. But he must have  the money, the clothes, and then he must deliberately set out to startle  The Corner, make himself a public figure, talked of, pointed at, known,  feared, respected, and even loved by at least a few. He must accomplish  all these things beginning at a literal zero.    It was the impossible nature of this that tempted Donnegan. But the  paradoxical picture of the ragged skulker in Milligan's actually sitting  at the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#15)"],[1,"Were, in my eyeballs lively portray'd,  Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,  Circling in fashion of a diadem,  And girt the star, and hov'ring round it wheel'd.    Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,  And draws the spirit most unto itself,  Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,  Compar'd unto the sounding of that lyre,  Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays  The floor of heav'n, was crown'd. \"Angelic Love  I am, who thus with hov'ring flight enwheel  The lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,  Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,  Lady of Heav'n! will hover; long as thou  Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy  Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere.\"    Such close was to the circling melody:  And, as it ended, all the other lights  Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.    The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps  The world, and with the nearer breath of God  Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir'd  Its inner hem and skirting over us,  That yet no glimmer of its majesty  Had stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyes  Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,  That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;  And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms  For very eagerness towards the breast,  After the milk is taken; so outstretch'd  Their wavy summits all the fervent band,  Through zealous love to Mary: then in view  There halted, and \"Regina Coeli\" sang  So sweetly, the delight hath left me never.    O what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'd  In those rich-laden coffers, which below  Sow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.    Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears  Were in the Babylonian exile won,  When gold had fail'd them.  Here in synod high  Of ancient council with the new conven'd,  Under the Son of Mary and of God,  Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,  To whom the keys of glory were assign'd.          CANTO XXIV    \"O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc'd  To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,  Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd!  If to this man through God's grace be vouchsaf'd  Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,  Or ever death his fated term prescribe;  Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;  But may some influence of your sacred dews  Sprinkle him.  Of the fount ye alway drink,  Whence flows what most he craves.\"  Beatrice spake,  And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres  On firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blaze  Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind  Their circles in the horologe, so work  The stated rounds, that to th' observant eye  The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;  E'en thus their carols weaving variously,  They by the measure pac'd, or swift, or slow,  Made me to rate the riches of their joy.    From that, which I did note in beauty most  Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame  So bright, as none was left more goodly there.  Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about,  With so divine a song, that fancy's ear  Records it not; and the pen passeth on  And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,  Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain,  Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.    \"O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout  Is with so vehement affection urg'd,  Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere.\"    Such were the accents towards my lady breath'd  From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd:  To whom she thus: \"O everlasting light  Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord  Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss  He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,  With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,  By the which thou didst on the billows walk.  If he in love, in hope, and in belief,  Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou  Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld  In liveliest portraiture.  But since true faith  Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,  Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,  Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse.\"    Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,  And speaks not, till the master have propos'd  The question, to approve, and not to end it;  So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake,  Summoning up each argument to aid;  As was behooveful for such questioner,  And such profession: \"As good Christian ought,  Declare thee, What is faith?\"  Whereat I rais'd  My forehead to the light, whence this had breath'd,  Then turn'd to Beatrice, and in her looks  Approval met, that from their inmost fount  I should unlock the waters.  \"May the grace,  That giveth me the captain of the church  For confessor,\" said I, \"vouchsafe to me  Apt utterance for my thoughts!\" then added: \"Sire!  E'en as set down by the unerring style  Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir'd  To bring Rome in unto the way of life,  Faith of things hop'd is substance, and the proof  Of things not seen; and herein doth consist  Methinks its essence,\"--\"Rightly hast thou deem'd,\"  Was answer'd: \"if thou well discern, why first  He hath defin'd it, substance, and then proof.\"    \"The deep things,\" I replied, \"which here I scan  Distinctly, are below from mortal eye  So hidden, they have in belief alone  Their being, on which credence hope sublime  Is built; and therefore substance it intends.  And inasmuch as we must needs infer  From such belief our reasoning, all respect  To other view excluded, hence of proof  Th' intention is deriv'd.\"  Forthwith I heard:  \"If thus, whate'er by learning men attain,  Were understood, the sophist would want room  To exercise his wit.\"  So breath'd the flame  Of love: then added: \"Current is the coin  Thou utter'st, both in weight and in alloy.  But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.\"    \"Even so glittering and so round,\" said I,  \"I not a whit misdoubt of its assay.\"    Next issued from the deep imbosom'd splendour:  \"Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which  Is founded every virtue, came to thee.\"  \"The flood,\" I answer'd, \"from the Spirit of God  Rain'd down upon the ancient bond and new,--  Here is the reas'ning, that convinceth me  So feelingly, each argument beside  Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.\"  Then heard I: \"Wherefore holdest thou that each,  The elder proposition and the new,  Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav'n?\"    \"The works, that follow'd, evidence their truth;\"  I answer'd: \"Nature did not make for these  The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.\"  \"Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,\"  Was the reply, \"that they in very deed  Are that they purport?  None hath sworn so to thee.\"    \"That all the world,\" said I, \"should have been turn'd  To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,  Would in itself be such a miracle,  The rest were not an hundredth part so great.  E'en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger  To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,  It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.\"  That ended, through the high celestial court  Resounded all the spheres.  \"Praise we one God!\"  In song of most unearthly melody.  And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,  Examining, had led me, that we now  Approach'd the topmost bough, he straight resum'd;  \"The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,  So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos'd  That, whatsoe'er has past them, I commend.  Behooves thee to express, what thou believ'st,  The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.\"    \"O saintly sire and spirit!\" I began,  \"Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,  As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,  Toward the sepulchre?  thy will is here,  That I the tenour of my creed unfold;  And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask'd.  And I reply: I in one God believe,  One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love  All heav'n is mov'd, himself unmov'd the while.  Nor demonstration physical alone,  Or more intelligential and abstruse,  Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth  It cometh to me rather, which is shed  Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms.  The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,  When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.  In three eternal Persons I believe,  Essence threefold and one, mysterious league  Of union absolute, which, many a time,  The word of gospel lore upon my mind  Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,  The lively flame dilates, and like heav'n's star  Doth glitter in me.\"  As the master hears,  Well pleas'd, and then enfoldeth in his arms  The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,  And having told the errand keeps his peace;  Thus benediction uttering with song  Soon as my peace I held, compass'd me thrice  The apostolic radiance, whose behest  Had op'd lips; so well their answer pleas'd.          CANTO XXV    If e'er the sacred poem that hath made  Both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil,  And with lean abstinence, through many a year,  Faded my brow, be destin'd to prevail  Over the cruelty, which bars me forth  Of the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lamb  The wolves set on and fain had worried me,  With other voice and fleece of other grain  I shall forthwith return, and, standing up  At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath  Due to the poet's temples: for I there  First enter'd on the faith which maketh souls  Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,  Peter had then circled my forehead thus.    Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth  The first fruit of Christ's vicars on the earth,  Toward us mov'd a light, at view whereof  My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:  \"Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,  That makes Falicia throng'd with visitants!\"    As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,  In circles each about the other wheels,  And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw I  One, of the other great and glorious prince,  With kindly greeting hail'd, extolling both  Their heavenly banqueting; but when an end  Was to their gratulation, silent, each,  Before me sat they down, so burning bright,  I could not look upon them.  Smiling then,"]]]
