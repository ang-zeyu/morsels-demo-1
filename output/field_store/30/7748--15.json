The odour, which the fruit,  And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,  Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.  Nor once alone encompassing our route  We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:  Pain, said Iolace rather: for that will  To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led  To call Elias, joyful when he paid  Our ransom from his vein.\"  I answering thus:  \"Forese! from that day, in which the world  For better life thou changedst, not five years  Have circled.

A time to come  Stands full within my view, to which this hour  Shall not be counted of an ancient date,  When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn'd  Th' unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare  Unkerchief'd bosoms to the common gaze.  What savage women hath the world e'er seen,  What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge  Of spiritual or other discipline,  To force them walk with cov'ring on their limbs!  But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav'n  Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,  Their mouths were op'd for howling: they shall taste  Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)  Or ere the cheek of him be cloth'd with down  Who is now rock'd with lullaby asleep.  Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,  Thou seest how not I alone but all  Gaze, where thou veil'st the intercepted sun.\"    Whence I replied: \"If thou recall to mind  What we were once together, even yet  Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.  That I forsook that life, was due to him  Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,  When she was round, who shines with sister lamp  To his, that glisters yonder,\" and I show'd  The sun.  \"Tis he, who through profoundest night  Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh  As true, that follows.

Still we spake,  And urg'd our travel stoutly, like a ship  When the wind sits astern.  The shadowy forms,    That seem'd things dead and dead again, drew in  At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,  Perceiving I had life; and I my words  Continued, and thus spake; \"He journeys up  Perhaps more tardily then else he would,  For others' sake.  But tell me, if thou know'st,  Where is Piccarda?  Tell me, if I see  Any of mark, among this multitude,  Who eye me thus.\"--\"My sister (she for whom,  'Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say  Which name was fitter ) wears e'en now her crown,  And triumphs in Olympus.\"  Saying this,  He added: \"Since spare diet hath so worn  Our semblance out, 't is lawful here to name  Each one.  This,\" and his finger then he rais'd,  \"Is Buonaggiuna,--Buonaggiuna, he  Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc'd  Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,  Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,  And purges by wan abstinence away  Bolsena's eels and cups of muscadel.\"    He show'd me many others, one by one,  And all, as they were nam'd, seem'd well content;  For no dark gesture I discern'd in any.  I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind  His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,  That wav'd the crozier o'er a num'rous flock.  I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile  To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so  Was one ne'er sated.  I howe'er, like him,  That gazing 'midst a crowd, singles out one,  So singled him of Lucca; for methought  Was none amongst them took such note of me.  Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:  The sound was indistinct, and murmur'd there,  Where justice, that so strips them, fix'd her sting.    \"Spirit!\" said I, \"it seems as thou wouldst fain  Speak with me.  Let me hear thee.  Mutual wish  To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.\"    He, answ'ring, straight began: \"Woman is born,  Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make  My city please thee, blame it as they may.  Go then with this forewarning.  If aught false  My whisper too implied, th' event shall tell  But say, if of a  truth I see the man  Of that new lay th' inventor, which begins  With 'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love'.\"    To whom I thus: \"Count of me but as one  Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,  Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.\"    \"Brother!\" said he, \"the hind'rance which once held  The notary with Guittone and myself,  Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,  Is now disclos'd.  I see how ye your plumes  Stretch, as th' inditer guides them; which, no question,  Ours did not.  He that seeks a grace beyond,  Sees not the distance parts one style from other.\"  And, as contented, here he held his peace.    Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,  In squared regiment direct their course,  Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;  Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn'd  Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike  Through leanness and desire.  And as a man,  Tir'd With the motion of a trotting steed,  Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,  Till his o'erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;  E'en so Forese let that holy crew  Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,  And saying: \"When shall I again behold thee?\"    \"How long my life may last,\" said I, \"I know not;  This know, how soon soever I return,  My wishes will before me have arriv'd.  Sithence the place, where I am set to live,  Is, day by day, more scoop'd of all its good,  And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.\"    \"Go now,\" he cried: \"lo! he, whose guilt is most,  Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels  Of an infuriate beast.  Toward the vale,  Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,  Each step increasing swiftness on the last;  Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him  A corse most vilely shatter'd.

When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes  No nearer reach'd him, than my thought his words,  The branches of another fruit, thick hung,  And blooming fresh, appear'd.  E'en as our steps  Turn'd thither, not far off it rose to view.  Beneath it were a multitude, that rais'd  Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What  Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,  That beg, and answer none obtain from him,  Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,  He at arm's length the object of their wish  Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.    At length, as undeceiv'd they went their way:  And we approach the tree, who vows and tears  Sue to in vain, the mighty tree.  \"Pass on,  And come not near.  Stands higher up the wood,  Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta'en  'this plant.\" Such sounds from midst the thickets came.  Whence I, with either bard, close to the side  That rose, pass'd forth beyond.  \"Remember,\" next  We heard, \"those noblest creatures of the clouds,  How they their twofold bosoms overgorg'd  Oppos'd in fight to Theseus: call to mind  The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop'd  To ease their thirst; whence Gideon's ranks were thinn'd,  As he to Midian march'd adown the hills.\"    Thus near one border coasting, still we heard  The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile  Reguerdon'd.  Then along the lonely path,  Once more at large, full thousand paces on  We travel'd, each contemplative and mute.    \"Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?\"  Thus suddenly a voice exclaim'd: whereat  I shook, as doth a scar'd and paltry beast;  Then rais'd my head to look from whence it came.    Was ne'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen  So bright and glowing red, as was the shape  I now beheld.  \"If ye desire to mount,\"  He cried, \"here must ye turn.  This way he goes,  Who goes in quest of peace.\"  His countenance  Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac'd  Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs.

It must be added, however, that in one respect this function of the  judiciary has had an unfortunate effect in lessening rather than  developing in the people the sense of constitutional morality. In your  country the power of Parliament is omnipotent, and yet in its  legislation it voluntarily observes these great fundamental decencies  of liberty which in the American Constitution are protected by formal  guarantees. This can only be true because either your representatives in  Parliament have a deep sense of constitutional morality, or that the  constituencies which select them have so much sense of constitutional  justice that their representatives dare not disregard these fundamental  decencies of liberty.    In the United States, however, the confidence that the Supreme Court  will itself protect these guaranties of liberty has led to a diminution  of the sense of constitutional morality, both in the people and their  representatives. It abates the vigilance which is said to be ever the  price of liberty.    Laws are passed which transgress the limitations of the Constitution  without adequate discussion as to their unconstitutional character, for  the reason that the determination of this fact is erroneously supposed  to be the exclusive function of the judiciary.    The judiciary, contrary to the common supposition, has no plenary power  to nullify unconstitutional laws. It can only do so when there is an  irreconcilable and indubitable repugnancy between a law and the  Constitution; but obviously laws can be passed from motives that are  anti-constitutional, and there is a wide sphere of political discretion  in which many acts can be done which, while politically  anti-constitutional, are not juridically unconstitutional. For this  reason, the undue dependence upon the judiciary to nullify every law  which either in form, necessary operation, or motive transgresses the  Constitution has so far lessened the vigilance of the people to protect  their own Constitution as to lead to its serious impairment.        5.      _The fifth fundamental principle was a system of governmental checks and  balances_.    The founders of the Republic were not enamoured of power. As they viewed  human history, the worst evils of government were due to excessive  concentration of power, which like Othello's jealousy \"makes the meat it  feeds on.\"    This system of checks and balances again illustrates that the  Constitution is the great negation of unrestrained democracy. The  framers believed that a people was best governed that was least  governed. Therefore, their purpose was not so much to promote efficiency  in legislation as to put a brake upon precipitate action.    Time does not suffice to state the intricate system of checks and  balances whereby the legislature acts as a check upon the executive and  the executive upon the legislature, and the Supreme Court upon both.  When the Republic was small, and its public affairs were few, this  system of checks and balances worked admirably, but to-day, when the  nation is one of the greatest in the world, and its public affairs are  of the most important and complicated character, and often require  speedy action, it may be questioned whether the system is not now an  undue brake upon governmental efficiency, and does _not_ require some  modification to ensure efficiency. Indeed, it is a serious question with  many thoughtful Americans whether the growth of the United States has  not put an excessive strain upon its governmental machinery.    This system was in part due to the confident belief of the framers of  the Constitution in the Montesquieu doctrine of the division of  government into three independent departments--legislative, executive  and judicial; but experience has shown how difficult it is to apply this  doctrine in its literal rigidity. One result of the doctrine was the  mistaken attempt to keep the legislative and the executive as far apart  as possible. The Cabinet system of parliamentary government was not  adopted. While the President can appear before Congress and express his  views, his Cabinet is without such right. In practice, the gulf is  bridged by constant contact between the Cabinet and the committees of  Congress, but this does not wholly secure speedy and efficient  co-operation between the two departments. As I speak, a movement is in  progress, with the sanction of President Harding, to permit members of  his Cabinet to appear in Congress and thus defend directly and in person  the policies of the Executive.    This separation of the two departments, which causes so much friction,  has been emphasized by one feature of the Constitution which again marks  its distrust of democracy, namely the fixed tenure of office. The  Constitution did not intend that public officials should rise or fall  with the fleeting caprices of a constituency. It preferred to give the  President and the members of Congress a fixed term of office, and,  however unpopular they might become temporarily, they should have the  right and the opportunity to proceed even with unpopular policies, and  thus challenge the final verdict of the people.    If a parliamentary form of government, immediately responsive to  current opinion as registered in elections, is the great desideratum,  then the fixed tenure of offices is the vulnerable Achilles-heel of our  form of government. In other countries the Executive cannot survive a  vote of want of confidence by the legislature. In America, the  President, who is merely the Executive of the legislative will,  continues for his prescribed term, though he may have wholly lost the  confidence of the representatives of the people in Congress. While this  makes for stability in administration and keeps the ship of state on an  even keel, yet it also leads to the fatalism of our democracy, and often  the \"native hue\" of its resolution is thus \"sicklied o'er with the pale  cast of thought.\" Take a striking instance. I am confident that after  the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the United States would have entered the  world war, if President Wilson's tenure of power had then depended upon  a vote of confidence.        6.      _The sixth fundamental principle is the joint power of the Senate and  the Executive over the foreign relations of the Government_.    I need not dwell at length upon this unique feature of our  constitutional system, for since the Versailles Treaty, the world has  become well acquainted with our peculiar system under which treaties are  made and war is declared or terminated. Nothing, excepting the principle  of local rule, was of deeper concern to the framers of the Constitution.  When it was framed, it was the accepted principle of all other nations  that the control of the foreign relations of the Government was the  exclusive prerogative of the Executive. In your country the only  limitation upon that power was the control of Parliament over the purse  of the nation, and some of the great struggles in your history related  to the attempt of the Crown to exact money to carry on the wars without  a Parliament grant.    The framers were unwilling to lodge any such power in the Executive,  however great his powers in other respects. This was primarily due to  the conception of the States that then prevailed. While they had created  a central government for certain specified purposes, they yet regarded  themselves as sovereign nations, and their representatives in the Senate  were, in a sense, their ambassadors. They were as little inclined to  permit the President of the United States to make treaties or declare  war at will in their behalf as the European nations would be to-day to  vest a similar authority in the League of Nations. It was, therefore,  first proposed that the power to make treaties and appoint diplomatic  representatives should be vested exclusively in the Senate, but as that  body was not always in session, this plan was so far modified as to give  the President, who is always acting, the power to _negotiate_ treaties  \"with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" As to making war, the  framers were not willing to entrust the power even to the President and  the Senators, and it was therefore expressly provided that only Congress  could take this momentous step.    Here, again, the theory of the Constitution was necessarily somewhat  modified in practical administration, for under the power of nominating  diplomatic representatives, negotiating treaties, and in general, of  executing the laws of the nation, the principle was soon evolved that  the conduct of foreign affairs was primarily the function of the  President, with the limitation that the Senate must concur in diplomatic  appointments and in the validity of treaties, and that only both Houses  of Congress could jointly declare war. This cumbrous system necessarily  required that the President in conducting the foreign relations of the  Government should keep in touch with the Senate, and such was the  accepted procedure throughout the history of the nation until President  Wilson saw fit to ignore the Senate, even when the Senate had indicated  its dissent in advance to some of his policies at the Versailles  Conference.    I suppose that since that conference no part of our constitutional  system has caused more adverse comment in Europe than this system. It  often handicaps the United States from taking a speedy and effectual  part in international negotiations, although if the President and the  Senate be in harmony and collaborate in this joint responsibility, there  is no necessary reason why this should be so.    I share the view of many Americans that this provision of the  Constitution was wise and salutary, especially at this time, when the  United States has taken such an important position in the councils of  civilization. The President is a very powerful Executive, and his  tenure, while short, is fixed."]]]
