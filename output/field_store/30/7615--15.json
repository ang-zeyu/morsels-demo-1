Notwithstanding this proclamation, roguish speculators still carried  them on, and the deluded people still encouraged them. On the 12th of  July, an order of the Lords Justices assembled in privy council was  published, dismissing all the petitions that had been presented for  patents and charters, and dissolving all the bubble companies. The  following copy of their lordships' order, containing a list of all these  nefarious projects, will not be deemed uninteresting at the present day,  when there is but too much tendency in the public mind to indulge in  similar practices:--    \"At the Council Chamber, Whitehall, the 12th day of July, 1720. Present,  their Excellencies the Lords Justices in Council.    \"Their Excellencies, the Lords Justices in council, taking into  consideration the many inconveniences arising to the public from several  projects set on foot for raising of joint stock for various purposes,  and that a great many of his Majesty's subjects have been drawn in to  part with their money on pretence of assurances that their petitions  for patents and charters, to enable them to carry on the same, would  be granted: to prevent such impositions, their Excellencies, this day,  ordered the said several petitions, together with such reports from the  Board of Trade, and from his Majesty's Attorney and Solicitor General,  as had been obtained thereon, to be laid before them, and after mature  consideration thereof, were pleased, by advice of his Majesty's Privy  Council, to order that the said petitions be dismissed, which are as  follow:--    \"1.

I observed a book lying upon the dressing table, and concluding that it  was one which Harley had brought with him, I took it up, glancing at the  title. It was \"Negro Magic,\" and switching on the light, for there was a  private electric plant in Cray's Folly, I opened the book at random and  began to read.    \"The religion of the negro,\" said this authority, \"is emotional, and  more often than not associated with beliefs in witchcraft and in the  rites known as Voodoo or Obi Mysteries. It has been endeavoured by  some students to show that these are relics of the Fetish worship of  equatorial Africa, but such a genealogy has never been satisfactorily  demonstrated. The cannibalistic rituals, human sacrifices, and obscene  ceremonies resembling those of the Black Sabbath of the Middle Ages,  reported to prevail in Haiti and other of the islands, and by some among  the negroes of the Southern States of America, may be said to rest on  doubtful authority. Nevertheless, it is a fact beyond doubt that among  the negroes both of the West Indies and the United States there is a  widespread belief in the powers of the Obeah man. A native who believes  himself to have come under the spell of such a sorcerer will sink into a  kind of decline and sometimes die.\"    At this point I discovered several paragraphs underlined in pencil, and  concluding that the underlining had been done by Paul Harley, I read  them with particular care. They were as follows: \"According to Hesketh  J. Bell, the term Obeah is most probably derived from the substantive  Obi, a word used on the East coast of Africa to denote witchcraft,  sorcery, and fetishism in general. The etymology of Obi has been traced  to a very antique source, stretching far back into Egyptian mythology.  A serpent in the Egyptian language was called Ob or Aub. Obion is still  the Egyptian name for a serpent. Moses, in the name of God, forbade the  Israelites ever to enquire of the demon, Ob, which is translated in our  Bible: Charmer or wizard, divinator or sorcerer. The Witch of Endor is  called Oub or Ob, translated Pythonissa; and Oubois was the name of the  basilisk or royal serpent, emblem of the Sun and an ancient oracular  deity of Africa.\"    A paragraph followed which was doubly underlined, and pursuing my  reading I made a discovery which literally caused me to hold my breath.  This is what I read:    \"In a recent contribution to the _Occult Review_, Mr. Colin Camber, the  American authority, offered some very curious particulars in support  of a theory to show that whereas snakes and scorpions have always been  recognized as sacred by Voodoo worshippers, the real emblem of their  unclean religion is the bat, especially _the Vampire Bat of South  America._    \"He pointed out that the symptoms of one dying beneath the spell of an  Obeah man are closely paralleled in the cases of men and animals who  have suffered from nocturnal attacks of blood-sucking bats.\"    I laid the open book down upon the bed. My brain was in a tumult.  The several theories, or outlines of theories which hitherto I had  entertained, were, by these simple paragraphs, cast into the utmost  disorder. I thought of the Colonel's covert references to a neighbour  whom he feared, of his guarded statement that the devotees of Voodoo  were not confined to the West Indies, of the attack upon him in  Washington, of the bat wing pinned to the door of Cray's Folly.    Incredulously, I thought of my acquaintance of the Lavender Arms, with  his bemused expression and his magnificent brow; and a great doubt and  wonder grew up in my mind.    I became increasingly impatient for the return of Paul Harley. I felt  that a clue of the first importance had fallen into my possession; so  that when, presently, as I walked impatiently up and down the room, the  door opened and Harley entered, I greeted him excitedly.    \"Harley!\" I cried, \"Harley! I have learned a most extraordinary thing!\"    Even as I spoke and looked into the keen, eager face, the expression  in Harley's eyes struck me. I recognized that in him, too, intense  excitement was pent up. Furthermore, he was in one of his irritable  moods. But, full of my own discoveries:    \"I chanced to glance at this book,\" I continued, \"whilst I was waiting  for you. You have underlined certain passages.\"    He stared at me queerly.    \"I discovered the book in my own library after you had gone last night,  Knox, and it was then that I marked the passages which struck me as  significant.\"    \"But, Harley,\" I cried, \"the man who is quoted here, Colin Camber, lives  in this very neighbourhood!\"    \"I know.\"    \"What! You know?\"    \"I learned it from Inspector Aylesbury of the County Police half an hour  ago.\"    Harley frowned perplexedly. \"Then, why, in Heaven's name didn't you tell  me?\" he exclaimed. \"It would have saved me a most disagreeable journey  into Market Hilton.\"    \"Market Hilton! What, have you been into the town?\"    \"That is exactly where I have been, Knox. I 'phoned through to Innes  from the village post-office after lunch to have the car sent down.  There is a convenient garage by the Lavender Arms.\"    \"But the Colonel has three cars,\" I exclaimed.    \"The horse has four legs,\" replied Harley, irritably, \"but although I  have only two, there are times when I prefer to use them. I am still  wondering why you failed to mention this piece of information when you  had obtained it.\"    \"My dear Harley,\" said I, patiently, \"how could I possibly be expected  to attach any importance to the matter? You must remember that at the  time I had never seen this work on negro sorcery.\"    \"No,\" said Harley, dropping down upon the bed, \"that is perfectly true,  Knox. I am afraid I have a liver at times; a distinct Indian liver.  Excuse me, old man, but to tell you the truth I feel strangely inclined  to pack my bag and leave for London without a moment's delay.\"    \"What!\" I cried.    \"Oh, I know you would be sorry to go, Knox,\" said Harley, smiling,  \"and so, for many reasons, should I. But I have the strongest possible  objection to being trifled with.\"    \"I am afraid I don't quite understand you, Harley.\"    \"Well, just consider the matter for a moment. Do you suppose that  Colonel Menendez is ignorant of the fact that his nearest neighbour is a  recognized authority upon Voodoo and allied subjects?\"    \"You are speaking, of course, of Colin Camber?\"    \"Of none other.\"    \"No,\" I replied, thoughtfully, \"the Colonel must know, of course, that  Camber resides in the neighbourhood.\"    \"And that he knows something of the nature of Camber's studies his  remarks sufficiently indicate,\" added Harley. \"The whole theory to  account for these attacks upon his life rests on the premise that agents  of these Obeah people are established in England and America. Then, in  spite of my direct questions, he leaves me to find out for myself that  Colin Camber's property practically adjoins his own!\"    \"Really! Does he reside so near as that?\"    \"My dear fellow,\" cried Harley, \"he lives at a place called the Guest  House. You can see it from part of the grounds of Cray's Folly. We were  looking at it to-day.\"    \"What! the house on the hillside?\"    \"That's the Guest House! What do you make of it, Knox? That Menendez  suspects this man is beyond doubt. Why should he hesitate to mention his  name?\"    \"Well,\" I replied, slowly, \"probably because to associate practical  sorcery and assassination with such a character would be preposterous.\"    \"But the man is admittedly a student of these things, Knox.\"    \"He may be, and that he is a genius of some kind I am quite prepared to  believe. But having had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Colin Camber, I am  not prepared to believe him capable of murder.\"    I suppose I spoke with a certain air of triumph, for Paul Harley  regarded me silently for a while.    \"You seem to be taking this case out of my hands, Knox,\" he said.  \"Whilst I have been systematically at work racing about the county in  quest of information you would appear to have blundered further into the  labyrinth than all my industry has enabled me to do.\"    He remained in a very evil humour, and now the cause of this suddenly  came to light.    \"I have spent a thoroughly unpleasant afternoon,\" he continued,  \"interviewing an impossible country policeman who had never heard of my  existence!\"    This display of human resentment honestly delighted me. It was  refreshing to know that the omniscient Paul Harley was capable of pique.    \"One, Inspector Aylesbury,\" he went on, bitterly, \"a large person  bearing a really interesting resemblance to a walrus, but lacking that  creature's intelligence. It was not until Superintendent East had spoken  to him from Scotland Yard that he ceased to treat me as a suspect. But  his new attitude was almost more provoking than the old one. He adopted  the manner of a regimental sergeant-major reluctantly interviewing  a private with a grievance. If matters should so develop that we are  compelled to deal with that fish-faced idiot, God help us all!\"    He burst out laughing, his good humour suddenly quite restored, and  taking out his pipe began industriously to load it.    \"I can smoke while I am changing,\" he said, \"and you can sit there and  tell me all about Colin Camber.\"    I did as he requested, and Harley, who could change quicker than any  man I had ever known, had just finished tying his bow as I completed my  story of the encounter at the Lavender Arms.    \"Hm,\" he muttered, as I ceased speaking. \"At every turn I realize that  without you I should have been lost, Knox. I am afraid I shall have to  change your duties to-morrow.\"    \"Change my duties? What do you mean?\"    \"I warn you that the new ones will be less pleasant than the old! In  other words, I must ask you to tear"]]]
