At present,  certainly, they seem perfectly regardless of them; and the  Captain-General of Pernambuco walks through the streets with as  apparent content and composure as an English statesman would proceed  down Charing Cross. Custom reconciles everything. In a week or two the  stranger himself begins to feel less the things which annoyed him so  much upon his first arrival, and after a few months' residence he  thinks no more about them, while he is partaking of the hospitality and  enjoying the elegance and splendour within doors in this great city.    Close by the river-side stands what is called the palace of the  Captain-General of Pernambuco. Its form and appearance altogether  strike the traveller that it was never intended for the use it is at  present put to.    Reader, throw a veil over thy recollection for a little while, and  forget the cruel, unjust and unmerited censures thou hast heard against  an unoffending order. This palace was once the Jesuits' college, and  originally built by those charitable fathers. Ask the aged and  respectable inhabitants of Pernambuco, and they will tell thee that the  destruction of the Society of Jesus was a terrible disaster to the  public, and its consequences severely felt to the present day.    When Pombal took the reins of power into his own hands, virtue and  learning beamed bright within the college walls. Public catechism to  the children, and religious instruction to all, flowed daily from the  mouths of its venerable priests.    They were loved, revered and respected throughout the whole town. The  illuminating philosophers of the day had sworn to exterminate Christian  knowledge, and the college of Pernambuco was doomed to founder in the  general storm. To the long-lasting sorrow and disgrace of Portugal, the  philosophers blinded her king and flattered her prime minister. Pombal  was exactly the tool these sappers of every public and private virtue  wanted. He had the naked sword of power in his own hand, and his heart  was hard as flint. He struck a mortal blow and the Society of Jesus,  throughout the Portuguese dominions, was no more.    One morning all the fathers of the college in Pernambuco, some of them  very old and feeble, were suddenly ordered into the refectory. They had  notice beforehand of the fatal storm, in pity, from the governor, but  not one of them abandoned his charge. They had done their duty and had  nothing to fear. They bowed with resignation to the will of Heaven. As  soon as they had all reached the refectory they were there locked up,  and never more did they see their rooms, their friends, their scholars,  or acquaintance. In the dead of the following night a strong guard of  soldiers literally drove them through the streets to the water's edge.  They were then conveyed in boats aboard a ship and steered for Bahia.  Those who survived the barbarous treatment they experienced from  Pombal's creatures, were at last ordered to Lisbon. The college of  Pernambuco was plundered, and some time after an elephant was kept  there.    Thus the arbitrary hand of power, in one night, smote and swept away  the sciences: to which succeeded the low vulgar buffoonery of a  showman. Virgil and Cicero made way for a wild beast from Angola! and  now a guard is on duty at the very gate where, in times long past, the  poor were daily fed!    Trust not, kind reader, to the envious remarks which their enemies have  scattered far and near; believe not the stories of those who have had a  hand in the sad tragedy. Go to Brazil, and see with thine own eyes the  effect of Pombal's short-sighted policy. There vice reigns triumphant  and learning is at its lowest ebb. Neither is this to be wondered at.  Destroy the compass, and will the vessel find her far-distant port?  Will the flock keep together, and escape the wolves, after the  shepherds are all slain? The Brazilians were told that public education  would go on just as usual. They might have asked Government, who so  able to instruct our youth as those whose knowledge is proverbial? who  so fit as those who enjoy our entire confidence? who so worthy as those  whose lives are irreproachable?    They soon found that those who succeeded the fathers of the Society of  Jesus had neither their manner nor their abilities. They had not made  the instruction of youth their particular study. Moreover, they entered  on the field after a defeat where the officers had all been slain;  where the plan of the campaign was lost; where all was in sorrow and  dismay. No exertions of theirs could rally the dispersed, or skill  prevent the fatal consequences. At the present day the seminary of  Olinda, in comparison with the former Jesuits' college, is only as the  waning moon's beam to the sun's meridian splendour.    When you visit the places where those learned fathers once flourished,  and see with your own eyes the evils their dissolution has caused; when  you hear the inhabitants telling you how good, how clever, how  charitable they were; what will you think of our poet laureate for  calling them, in his _History of Brazil_, \"Missioners whose zeal the  most fanatical was directed by the coolest policy\"?    Was it _fanatical_ to renounce the honours and comforts of this  transitory life in order to gain eternal glory in the next, by denying  themselves, and taking up the cross? Was it _fanatical_ to preach  salvation to innumerable wild hordes of Americans? to clothe the naked?  to encourage the repenting sinner? to aid the dying Christian? The  fathers of the Society of Jesus did all this. And for this their zeal  is pronounced to be the most fanatical, directed by the coolest policy.  It will puzzle many a clear brain to comprehend how it is possible, in  the nature of things, that _zeal_ the most _fanatical_ should be  directed by the _coolest policy_. Ah, Mr. Laureate, Mr. Laureate, that  \"quidlibet audendi\" of yours may now and then gild the poet at the same  time that it makes the historian cut a sorry figure!    Could Father Nobrega rise from the tomb, he would thus address you:  \"Ungrateful Englishman, you have drawn a great part of your information  from the writings of the Society of Jesus, and in return you attempt to  stain its character by telling your countrymen that 'we taught the  idolatry we believed'! In speaking of me, you say it was my happy  fortune to be stationed in a country where _none_ but the good  principles of my order were called into action. Ungenerous laureate,  the narrow policy of the times has kept your countrymen in the dark  with regard to the true character of the Society of Jesus; and you draw  the bandage still tighter over their eyes by a malicious insinuation. I  lived and taught and died in Brazil, where you state that _none_ but  the good principles of my order were called into action, and still, in  most absolute contradiction to this, you remark we believed the  _idolatry_ we taught in Brazil. Thus we brought none but good  principles into action, and still taught idolatry!    \"Again, you state there is no individual to whose talents Brazil is so  greatly and permanently indebted as mine, and that I must be regarded  as the founder of that system so successfully pursued by the Jesuits in  Paraguay: a system productive of as much good as is compatible with  pious fraud. Thus you make me, at one and the same time, a teacher of  none but good principles, and a teacher of idolatry, and a believer in  idolatry, and still the founder of a system for which Brazil is greatly  and permanently indebted to me, though, by the by, the system was only  productive of as much good as is compatible with pious fraud!    \"What means all this? After reading such incomparable nonsense, should  your countrymen wish to be properly informed concerning the Society of  Jesus, there are in England documents enough to show that the system of  the Jesuits was a system of Christian charity towards their  fellow-creatures administered in a manner which human prudence judged  best calculated to ensure success; and that the idolatry which you  uncharitably affirm they taught was really and truly the very same  faith which the Catholic Church taught for centuries in England, which  she still teaches to those who wish to hear her, and which she will  continue to teach, pure and unspotted, till time shall be no more.\"    The environs of Pernambuco are very pretty. You see country houses in  all directions, and the appearance of here and there a sugar-plantation  enriches the scenery. Palm-trees, cocoanut-trees, orange and lemon  groves, and all the different fruits peculiar to Brazil, are here in  the greatest abundance.    At Olinda there is a national botanical garden: it wants space, produce  and improvement. The forests, which are several leagues off, abound  with birds, beasts, insects and serpents. Besides a brilliant plumage,  many of the birds have a very fine song. The troupiale, noted for its  rich colours, sings delightfully in the environs of Pernambuco. The  red-headed finch, larger than the European sparrow, pours forth a sweet  and varied strain, in company with two species of wrens, a little  before daylight. There are also several species of the thrush, which  have a song somewhat different from that of the European thrush; and  two species of the linnet, whose strain is so soft and sweet that it  dooms them to captivity in the houses. A bird called here  sangre-do-buey, blood of the ox, cannot fail to engage your attention:  he is of the passerine tribe, and very common about the houses; the  wings and tail are black and every other part of the body a flaming  red. In Guiana there is a species exactly the same as this in shape,  note and economy, but differing in colour, its whole body being like  black velvet; on its breast a tinge of red appears through the black.

His table of refractions enabled him  to abolish the error due to our atmosphere so far as it could affect  naked-eye observations. The azimuth circle of Tycho's largest quadrant  had a diameter of nine feet, and the quadrant a radius of six feet. He  introduced the mural quadrant for meridian observations.[2]    [Illustration: ANCIENT CHINESE INSTRUMENTS, Including quadrant, celestial  globe, and two armillae, in the Observatory at Peking. Photographed in  Peking by the author in 1875, and stolen by the Germans when the  Embassies were relieved by the allies in 1900.]    The French Jesuits at Peking, in the seventeenth century, helped the  Chinese in their astronomy. In 1875 the writer saw and photographed,  on that part of the wall of Peking used by the Mandarins as an  observatory, the six instruments handsomely designed by Father  Verbiest, copied from the instruments of Tycho Brahe, and embellished  with Chinese dragons and emblems cast on the supports. He also saw  there two old instruments (which he was told were Arabic) of date  1279, by Ko Show-King, astronomer to Koblai Khan, the grandson of  Chenghis Khan. One of these last is nearly identical with the armillae  of Tycho; and the other with his \"armillae aequatoriae maximae,\" with  which he observed the comet of 1585, besides fixed stars and  planets.[3]    The discovery by Galileo of the isochronism of the pendulum, followed  by Huyghens's adaptation of that principle to clocks, has been one of  the greatest aids to accurate observation. About the same time an  equally beneficial step was the employment of the telescope as a  pointer; not the Galilean with concave eye-piece, but with a  magnifying glass to examine the focal image, at which also a fixed  mark could be placed.  Kepler was the first to suggest this. Gascoigne  was the first to use it. Huyghens used a metal strip of variable width  in the focus, as a micrometer to cover a planetary disc, and so to  measure the width covered by the planet. The Marquis Malvasia, in  1662, described the network of fine silver threads at right angles,  which he used in the focus, much as we do now.    In the hands of such a skilful man as Tycho Brahe, the old open  sights, even without clocks, served their purpose sufficiently well to  enable Kepler to discover the true theory of the solar system. But  telescopic sights and clocks were required for proving some of  Newton's theories of planetary perturbations. Picard's observations at  Paris from 1667 onwards seem to embody the first use of the telescope  as a pointer. He was also the first to introduce the use of Huyghens's  clocks for observing the right ascension of stars.  Olaus Romer was  born at Copenhagen in 1644. In 1675, by careful study of the times of  eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, he discovered that light took time  to traverse space. Its velocity is 186,000 miles per second. In 1681  he took up his duties as astronomer at Copenhagen, and built the first  transit circle on a window-sill of his house. The iron axis was five  feet long and one and a-half inches thick, and the telescope was fixed  near one end with a counterpoise. The telescope-tube was a double  cone, to prevent flexure. Three horizontal and three vertical wires  were used in the focus. These were illuminated by a speculum, near the  object-glass, reflecting the light from a lantern placed over the  axis, the upper part of the telescope-tube being partly cut away to  admit the light. A divided circle, with pointer and reading  microscope, was provided for reading the declination. He realised the  superiority of a circle with graduations over a much larger  quadrant. The collimation error was found by reversing the instrument  and using a terrestrial mark, the azimuth error by star observations.  The time was expressed in fractions of a second. He also constructed a  telescope with equatoreal mounting, to follow a star by one axial  motion. In 1728 his instruments and observation records were destroyed  by fire.    Hevelius had introduced the vernier and tangent screw in his  measurement of arc graduations. His observatory and records were burnt  to the ground in 1679. Though an old man, he started afresh, and left  behind him a catalogue of 1,500 stars.    Flamsteed began his duties at Greenwich Observatory, as first  Astronomer Royal, in 1676, with very poor instruments. In 1683 he put  up a mural arc of 140 deg., and in 1689 a better one, seventy-nine inches  radius.  He conducted his measurements with great skill, and  introduced new methods to attain accuracy, using certain stars for  determining the errors of his instruments; and he always reduced his  observations to a form in which they could be readily used. He  introduced new methods for determining the position of the equinox and  the right ascension of a fundamental star.  He produced a catalogue of  2,935 stars. He supplied Sir Isaac Newton with results of observation  required in his theoretical calculations. He died in 1719.    Halley succeeded Flamsteed to find that the whole place had been  gutted by the latter's executors. In 1721 he got a transit instrument,  and in 1726 a mural quadrant by Graham. His successor in 1742,  Bradley, replaced this by a fine brass quadrant, eight feet radius, by  Bird; and Bradley's zenith sector was purchased for the observatory.  An instrument like this, specially designed for zenith stars, is  capable of greater rigidity than a more universal instrument; and  there is no trouble with refraction in the zenith. For these reasons  Bradley had set up this instrument at Kew, to attempt the proof of the  earth's motion by observing the annual parallax of stars. He certainly  found an annual variation of zenith distance, but not at the times of  year required by the parallax. This led him to the discovery of the  \"aberration\" of light and of nutation. Bradley has been described as  the founder of the modern system of accurate observation. He died in  1762, leaving behind him thirteen folio volumes of valuable but  unreduced observations. Those relating to the stars were reduced by  Bessel and published in 1818, at Koenigsberg, in his well-known  standard work, _Fundamenta Astronomiae_. In it are results showing the  laws of refraction, with tables of its amount, the maximum value of  aberration, and other constants.    Bradley was succeeded by Bliss, and he by Maskelyne (1765), who  carried on excellent work, and laid the foundations of the Nautical  Almanac (1767).  Just before his death he induced the Government to  replace Bird's quadrant by a fine new mural _circle_, six feet in  diameter, by Troughton, the divisions being read off by microscopes  fixed on piers opposite to the divided circle. In this instrument the  micrometer screw, with a divided circle for turning it, was applied  for bringing the micrometer wire actually in line with a division on  the circle--a plan which is still always adopted.    Pond succeeded Maskelyne in 1811, and was the first to use this  instrument. From now onwards the places of stars were referred to the  pole, not to the zenith; the zero being obtained from measures on  circumpolar stars. Standard stars were used for giving the clock  error. In 1816 a new transit instrument, by Troughton, was added, and  from this date the Greenwich star places have maintained the very  highest accuracy.    George Biddell Airy, Seventh Astronomer Royal,[4] commenced his  Greenwich labours in 1835. His first and greatest reformation in the  work of the observatory was one he had already established at  Cambridge, and is now universally adopted. He held that an observation  is not completed until it has been reduced to a useful form; and in  the case of the sun, moon, and planets these results were, in every  case, compared with the tables, and the tabular error printed.    Airy was firmly impressed with the object for which Charles II. had  wisely founded the observatory in connection with navigation, and for  observations of the moon. Whenever a meridian transit of the moon  could be observed this was done. But, even so, there are periods in  the month when the moon is too near the sun for a transit to be well  observed. Also weather interferes with many meridian observations. To  render the lunar observations more continuous, Airy employed  Troughton's successor, James Simms, in conjunction with the engineers,  Ransome and May, to construct an altazimuth with three-foot circles,  and a five-foot telescope, in 1847. The result was that the number of  lunar observations was immediately increased threefold, many of them  being in a part of the moon's orbit which had previously been bare of  observations. From that date the Greenwich lunar observations have  been a model and a standard for the whole world.    Airy also undertook to superintend the reduction of all Greenwich  lunar observations from 1750 to 1830.  The value of this laborious  work, which was completed in 1848, cannot be over-estimated.    The demands of astronomy, especially in regard to small minor planets,  required a transit instrument and mural circle with a more powerful  telescope. Airy combined the functions of both, and employed the same  constructors as before to make a _transit-circle_ with a telescope of  eleven and a-half feet focus and a circle of six-feet diameter, the  object-glass being eight inches in diameter.    Airy, like Bradley, was impressed with the advantage of employing  stars in the zenith for determining the fundamental constants of  astronomy. He devised a _reflex zenith tube_, in which the zenith  point was determined by reflection from a surface of mercury. The  design was so simple, and seemed so perfect, that great expectations  were entertained. But unaccountable variations comparable with those  of the transit circle appeared, and the instrument was put out of use  until 1903, when the present Astronomer Royal noticed that the  irregularities could be"]]]
