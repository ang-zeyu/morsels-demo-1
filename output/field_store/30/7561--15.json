[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#14)"],[1,"you?\" asked the animal, as if surprised.    \"Never!\" repeated the girl.  \"And you'll probably make yourself sick if  you don't stop crying.  Where do you live?\"    \"About two miles beyond Fuddlecumjig,\" was the answer.  \"Grandmother  Gnit made me the mittens, and she's one of the Fuddles.\"    \"Well, you'd better go home now, and perhaps the old lady will make you  another pair,\" suggested Dorothy.  \"We're on our way to Fuddlecumjig,  and you may hop along beside us.\"    So they rode on, and the kangaroo hopped beside the red wagon and  seemed quickly to have forgotten her loss.  By and by the Wizard said  to the animal:    \"Are the Fuddles nice people?\"    \"Oh, very nice,\" answered the kangaroo; \"that is, when they're properly  put together.  But they get dreadfully scattered and mixed up, at  times, and then you can't do anything with them.\"    \"What do you mean by their getting scattered?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"Why, they're made in a good many small pieces,\" explained the  kangaroo; \"and whenever any stranger comes near them they have a habit  of falling apart and scattering themselves around.  That's when they  get so dreadfully mixed, and it's a hard puzzle to put them together  again.\"    \"Who usually puts them together?\" asked Omby Amby.    \"Any one who is able to match the pieces.  I sometimes put Grandmother  Gnit together myself, because I know her so well I can tell every piece  that belongs to her.  Then, when she's all matched, she knits for me,  and that's how she made my mittens.  But it took a good many days hard  knitting, and I had to put Grandmother together a good many times,  because every time I came near, she'd scatter herself.\"    \"I should think she would get used to your coming, and not be afraid,\"  said Dorothy.    \"It isn't that,\" replied the kangaroo.  \"They're not a bit afraid, when  they're put together, and usually they're very jolly and pleasant.  It's just a habit they have, to scatter themselves, and if they didn't  do it they wouldn't be Fuddles.\"    The travelers thought upon this quite seriously for a time, while the  Sawhorse continued to carry them rapidly forward.  Then Aunt Em  remarked:    \"I don't see much use our visitin' these Fuddles.  If we find them  scattered, all we can do is to sweep 'em up, and then go about our  business.\"    \"Oh, I b'lieve we'd better go on,\" replied Dorothy.  \"I'm getting  hungry, and we must try to get some luncheon at Fuddlecumjig.  Perhaps  the food won't be scattered as badly as the people.\"    \"You'll find plenty to eat there,\" declared the kangaroo, hopping along  in big bounds because the Sawhorse was going so fast; \"and they have a  fine cook, too, if you can manage to put him together.  There's the  town now--just ahead of us!\"    They looked ahead and saw a group of very pretty houses standing in a  green field a little apart from the main road.    \"Some Munchkins came here a few days ago and matched a lot of people  together,\" said the kangaroo.  \"I think they are together yet, and if  you go softly, without making any noise, perhaps they won't scatter.\"    \"Let's try it,\" suggested the Wizard.    So they stopped the Sawhorse and got out of the wagon, and, after  bidding good bye to the kangaroo, who hopped away home, they entered  the field and very cautiously approached the group of houses.    So silently did they move that soon they saw through the windows of the  houses, people moving around, while others were passing to and fro in  the yards between the buildings.  They seemed much like other people  from a distance, and apparently they did not notice the little party so  quietly approaching.    They had almost reached the nearest house when Toto saw a large beetle  crossing the path and barked loudly at it.  Instantly a wild clatter  was heard from the houses and yards.  Dorothy thought it sounded like a  sudden hailstorm, and the visitors, knowing that caution was no longer  necessary, hurried forward to see what had happened.    After the clatter an intense stillness reigned in the town.  The  strangers entered the first house they came to, which was also the  largest, and found the floor strewn with pieces of the people who lived  there.  They looked much like fragments of wood neatly painted, and  were of all sorts of curious and fantastic shapes, no two pieces being  in any way alike.    They picked up some of these pieces and looked at them carefully.  On  one which Dorothy held was an eye, which looked at her pleasantly but  with an interested expression, as if it wondered what she was going to  do with it.  Quite near by she discovered and picked up a nose, and by  matching the two pieces together found that they were part of a face.    \"If I could find the mouth,\" she said, \"this Fuddle might be able to  talk, and tell us what to do next.\"    \"Then let us find it,\" replied the Wizard, and so all got down on their  hands and knees and began examining the scattered pieces.    \"I've found it!\" cried the Shaggy Man, and ran to Dorothy with a  queer-shaped piece that had a mouth on it.  But when they tried to fit  it to the eye and nose they found the parts wouldn't match together.    \"That mouth belongs to some other person,\" said Dorothy.  \"You see we  need a curve here and a point there, to make it fit the face.\"    \"Well, it must be here some place,\" declared the Wizard; \"so if we  search long enough we shall find it.\"    Dorothy fitted an ear on next, and the ear had a little patch of red  hair above it.  So while the others were searching for the mouth she  hunted for pieces with red hair, and found several of them which, when  matched to the other pieces, formed the top of a man's head.  She had  also found the other eye and the ear by the time Omby Amby in a far  corner discovered the mouth.  When the face was thus completed, all the  parts joined together with a nicety that was astonishing.    \"Why, it's like a picture puzzle!\" exclaimed the little girl.  \"Let's  find the rest of him, and get him all together.\"    \"What's the rest of him like?\" asked the Wizard.  \"Here are some pieces  of blue legs and green arms, but I don't know whether they are his or  not.\"    \"Look for a white shirt and a white apron,\" said the head which had  been put together, speaking in a rather faint voice.  \"I'm the cook.\"    \"Oh, thank you,\" said Dorothy.  \"It's lucky we started you first, for  I'm hungry, and you can be cooking something for us to eat while we  match the other folks together.\"    It was not so very difficult, now that they had a hint as to how the  man was dressed, to find the other pieces belonging to him, and as all  of them now worked on the cook, trying piece after piece to see if it  would fit, they finally had the cook set up complete.    When he was finished he made them a low bow and said:    \"I will go at once to the kitchen to prepare your dinner.  You will  find it something of a job to get all the Fuddles together, so I advise  you to begin on the Lord High Chigglewitz, whose first name is Larry.  He's a bald-headed fat man and is dressed in a blue coat with brass  buttons, a pink vest and drab breeches.  A piece of his left knee is  missing, having been lost years ago when he scattered himself too  carelessly.  That makes him limp a little, but he gets along very well  with half a knee.  As he is the chief personage in this town of  Fuddlecumjig, he will be able to welcome you and assist you with the  others.  So it will be best to work on him while I'm getting your  dinner.\"    \"We will,\" said the Wizard; \"and thank you very much, Cook, for the  suggestion.\"    Aunt Em was the first to discover a piece of the Lord High Chigglewitz.    \"It seems to me like a fool business, this matching folks together,\"  she remarked; \"but as we haven't anything to do till dinner's ready, we  may as well get rid of some of this rubbish.  Here, Henry, get busy and  look for Larry's bald head.  I've got his pink vest, all right.\"    They worked with eager interest, and Billina proved a great help to  them.  The Yellow Hen had sharp eyes and could put her head close to  the various pieces that lay scattered around.  She would examine the  Lord High Chigglewitz and see which piece of him was next needed, and  then hunt around until she found it.  So before an hour had passed old  Larry was standing complete before them.    \"I congratulate you, my friends,\" he said, speaking in a cheerful  voice.  \"You are certainly the cleverest people who ever visited us.  I  was never matched together so quickly in my life.  I'm considered a  great puzzle, usually.\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"there used to be a picture puzzle craze in  Kansas, and so I've had some 'sperience matching puzzles.  But the  pictures were flat, while you are round, and that makes you harder to  figure out.\"    \"Thank you, my dear,\" replied old Larry, greatly pleased.  \"I feel  highly complimented.  Were I not a really good puzzle, there would be  no object in my scattering myself.\"    \"Why do you do it?\" asked Aunt Em, severely.  \"Why don't you behave  yourself, and stay put together?\"    The Lord High Chigglewitz seemed annoyed by this speech; but he  replied, politely:    \"Madam, you have perhaps noticed that every person has some  peculiarity.  Mine is to scatter myself.  What your own peculiarity is  I will not venture to say; but I shall never find fault with you,  whatever you do.\"    \"Now you've got your diploma, Em,\" said Uncle Henry, with a laugh, \"and  I'm glad of it.  This is a queer country, and we may as well take  people as we find them.\"    \"If we did, we'd leave these folks scattered,\" she returned, and this  retort made everybody laugh good-naturedly.    Just then Omby Amby found a hand with a knitting needle in it, and they  decided to put Grandmother Gnit together.  She proved an easier puzzle  than old Larry, and when she was completed they found her a pleasant  old lady who welcomed them cordially.  Dorothy told her how the  kangaroo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#14)"],[1,", or  Sutra and Vinaya, of Mahayana, as well as of Himayana, are believed  to be the direct teachings of Shakya Muni himself, because all the  instructions are put in the mouth of the Master or sanctioned by him.   The Mahayanists, however, compare the Hinayana doctrine with a  resting-place on the road for a traveller, while the Mahayana  doctrine with his destination.  All the denominations of Buddhism,  with a single exception of Zen, are based on the authority of some  particular sacred writings.  The Ten Dai Sect, for instance, is based  on Saddharma-pundarika-sutra; the Jo Do Sect on Larger  Sukhavati-vyuha, Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha, and Amitayus-dhyana-sutra;  the Ke Gon Sect on Avatamsaka-sutra; the Hosso Sect on  Samdhi-nirmocana-sutra.      Zen is based on the highest spiritual plane attained by Shakya Muni  himself.  It can only be realized by one who has attained the same  plane.  To describe it in full by means of words is beyond the power  even of Gotama himself.  It is for this reason that the author of  Lankavatara-sutra insists that Shakya Muni spoke no word through his  long career of forty-nine years as a religious teacher, and that of  Mahaprajnyaparamita-sutra[FN#108] also express the same opinion.  The  Scripture is no more nor less than the finger pointing to the moon of  Buddhahood.  When we recognize the moon and enjoy its benign beauty,  the finger is of no use.  As the finger has no brightness whatever,  so the Scripture has no holiness whatever.  The Scripture is  religious currency representing spiritual wealth.  It does not matter  whether money be gold, or sea-shells, or cows.  It is a mere  substitute.  What it stands for is of paramount importance.  Away  with your stone-knife!  Do not watch the stake against which a  running hare once struck its head and died.  Do not wait for another  hare.  Another may not come for ever.  Do not cut the side of the  boat out of which you dropped your sword to mark where it sunk.  The  boat is ever moving on.  The Canon is the window through which we  observe the grand scenery of spiritual nature.  To hold communion  directly with it we must get out of the window.  It is a mere stray  fly that is always buzzing within it, struggling to get out.  Those  who spend most of their lives in the study of the Scriptures, arguing  and explaining with hair-splitting reasonings, and attain no higher  plane in spirituality, are religious flies good for nothing but their  buzzing about the nonsensical technicalities.  It is on this account  that Rin-zai declared:[FN#109] 'The twelve divisions of the Buddhist  Canon are nothing better than waste paper.'      [FN#108]  Mahaprajnyaparamita-sutra, vol. 425.    [FN#109]  Rin-zai-roku.        2. No Need of the Scriptural Authority for Zen.    Some Occidental scholars erroneously identify Buddhism with the  primitive faith of Hinayanism, and are inclined to call Mahayanism, a  later developed faith, a degenerated one.  If the primitive faith be  called the genuine, as these scholars think, and the later developed  faith be the degenerated one, then the child should be called the  genuine man and the grown-up people be the degenerated ones;  similarly, the primitive society must be the genuine and the modern  civilization be the degenerated one.  So also the earliest writings  of the Old Testament should be genuine and the four Gospels be  degenerated.  Beyond all doubt Zen belongs to Mahayanism, yet this  does not imply that it depends on the scriptural authority of that  school, because it does not trouble itself about the Canon whether it  be Hinayana or Mahayana, or whether it was directly spoken by Shakya  Muni or written by some later Buddhists.  Zen is completely free from  the fetters of old dogmas, dead creeds, and conventions of  stereotyped past, that check the development of a religious faith and  prevent the discovery of a new truth.  Zen needs no Inquisition.  It  never compelled nor will compel the compromise of a Galileo or a  Descartes.  No excommunication of a Spinoza or the burning of a Bruno  is possible for Zen.    On a certain occasion Yoh Shan (Yaku-san) did not preach the doctrine  for a long while, and was requested to give a sermon by his assistant  teacher, saying: \"Would your reverence preach the Dharma to your  pupils, who long thirst after your merciful instruction?\"  \"Then ring  the bell,\" replied Yoh Shan.  The bell rang, and all the monks  assembled in the Hall eager to bear the sermon.  Yoh Shan went up to  the pulpit and descended immediately without saying a word.  \"You,  reverend sir,\" asked the assistant, \"promised to deliver a sermon a  little while ago.  Why do you not preach?\"  \"Sutras are taught by the  Sutra teachers,\" said the master; \"Castras are taught by the Castra  teachers.  No wonder that I say nothing.\"[FN#110]  This little  episode will show you that Zen is no fixed doctrine embodied in a  Sutra or a Castra, but a conviction or realization within us.      [FN#110]  Zen-rin-rui-shu and E-gen.      To quote another example, an officer offered to Tung Shan (To-zan)  plenty of alms, and requested him to recite the sacred Canon.  Tung  Shan, rising from his chair, made a bow respectfully to the officer,  who did the same to the teacher.  Then Tung Shan went round the  chair, taking the officer with him, and making a bow again to the  officer, asked: \"Do you see what I mean?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied the  other. \"I have been reciting the sacred Canon, why do you not  see?\"[FN#111]  Thus Zen does not regard Scriptures in black and white  as its Canon, for it takes to-days and tomorrows of this actual life  as its inspired pages.      [FN#111]  Zen-rin-rui-sha and To-zan-roku.        3. The Usual Explanation of the Canon.    An eminent Chinese Buddhist scholar, well known as Ten Dai Dai Shi  (A.D. 538-597), arranged the whole preachings of Shakya Muni in a  chronological order in accordance with his own religious theory, and  observed that there were the Five Periods in the career of the Buddha  as a religious teacher.  He tried to explain away all the  discrepancies and contradictions, with which the Sacred Books are  encumbered, by arranging the Sutras in a line of development.  His  elucidation was so minute and clear, and his metaphysical reasonings  so acute and captivating, that his opinion was universally accepted  as an historical truth, not merely by the Chinese, but also by the  Japanese Mahayanists.  We shall briefly state here the so-called Five  Periods.    Shakya Muni attained to Buddhaship in his thirtieth year, and sat  motionless for seven days under the Bodhi tree, absorbed in deep  meditation, enjoying the first bliss of his Enlightenment.  In the  second week he preached his Dharma to the innumerable multitude of  Bodhisattvas,[FN#112] celestial beings, and deities in the nine  assemblies held at seven different places.  This is the origin of a  famous Mahayana book entitled Buddhavatamsaka-mahavaipulya-sutra.  In  this book the Buddha set forth his profound Law just as it was  discovered by his highly Enlightened mind, without considering the  mental states of his hearers.  Consequently the ordinary hearers (or  the Buddha's immediate disciples) could not understand the doctrine,  and sat stupefied as if they were 'deaf and dumb,' while the great  Bodhisattvas fully understood and realized the doctrine.  This is  called the first period, which lasted only two or three[FN#113] weeks.      [FN#112]  Bodhisattva is an imaginary personage, or ideal saint,  superior to Arhat, or the highest saint of Hinayanism.  The term  'Bodhisattva' was first applied to the Buddha before his  Enlightenment, and afterwards was adopted by Mahayanists to mean the  adherent of Mahayanism in contradistinction with the Cravaka or  hearers of Hinayanism.    [FN#113]  Bodhiruci says to the effect that the preachings in the  first five assemblies were made in the first week, and the rest were  delivered in the second week.  Nagarjuna says that the Buddha spoke  no word for fifty-seven days after his Enlightenment.  It is said in  Saddharma-pundarika-sutra that after three weeks the Buddha preached  at Varanasi, and it says nothing respecting Avatamsaka-sutra.  Though  there are divers opinions about the Buddha's first sermon and its  date, all traditions agree in this that he spent some time in  meditation, and then delivered the first sermon to the five ascetics  at Varanasi.      Thereupon Shakya Muni, having discovered that ordinary bearers were  too ignorant to believe in the Mahayana doctrine and appreciate the  greatness of Buddhahood, thought it necessary to modify his teaching  so as to adjust it to the capacity of ordinary people.  So he went to  Varanasi (or Benares) and preached his modified doctrine--that is,  Hinayanism.  The instruction given at that time has been handed down  to us as the four Agamas,[FN#114] or the four Nikayas.  This is  called the second period, which lasted about twelve years.  It was at  the beginning of this period that the Buddha converted the five  ascetics,[FN#115] who became his disciples.  Most of the Çravakas or  the adherents of Hinayanism were converted during this period.  They  trained their hearts in accordance with the modified Law, learned the  four noble truths,[FN#116] and worked out their own salvation.      [FN#114]  (1) Anguttara, (2) Majjhima, (3) Digha, (4) Samyutta.    [FN#115]  Kondanynya, Vappa, Baddiya, Mahanana, Assaji.    [FN#116]  The first is the sacred truth of suffering; the second the  truth of the origin of suffering--that is, lust and desire; the third  the sacred truth of the extinction of suffering; the fourth the  sacred truth of the path that leads to the extinction of suffering.  There are eight noble paths that lead to the extinction of  suffering--that is, Right faith, Right resolve, Right speech, Right  action, Right living, Right effort, Right thought, and Right  meditation.      The Buddha then having "]]]
