When a definite date or point in time is expressed, \"antaux\" means  \"before.\" When used with an expression of an \"amount\" of time, it is  to be translated by \"ago\" following the expression (not by \"before\"  preceding it):       Antaux dimancxo mi foriros, before Sunday I shall go away.

Antaux malmultaj jaroj li forkuris, a few years ago he escaped.    [Footnote: As already shown, \"kun\" expresses accompaniment, \"per\"  expresses instrumentality, \"pro\" expresses cause, \"kontraux\" expresses  opposition, \"anstataux\" expresses substitution, \"sur\", \"apud\", \"sub\",  etc., express place, \"dum\" expresses time, etc.]                                     VOCABULARY       dimancxo = Sunday.                 mateno = morning.     energia = energetic.               promeno = walk, promenade.     frosto = frost.                    rakonto = story, narrative.     je = at, on (89).                  ripozi = to rest, to repose.     kota = muddy.                      semajno = week.     labori = to work, to labor.        tempo = time.     laca = tired, weary.               tiel = thus, so (88)     lundo = Monday.                    tro = too, too much.     mardo = Tuesday.                   vespero = evening.                                   EN SEPTEMBRO.    Antaux multaj jaroj ni preferis resti en nia malgranda domo trans la  rivero, dum la tuta auxtuno. Sed nun ni restas tie nur gxis oktobro.  De auxgusto gxis oktobro la vetero estas tre agrabla tie, sed baldaux  post tiu monato la fortaj ventoj blovas, kaj la folioj komencas fali. La  frosto kovras la teron, kaj baldaux negxas tre ofte. Ju pli nudaj estas  la arboj, des pli malbelaj ili sxajnas. La vetero antaux novembro ne  estas tro malvarma, sed post tiu monato ni opinias ke la urbo estas pli  agrabla ol domo inter kampoj kaj arboj, trans largxa rivero. La frosto,  negxo kaj glacio kovras la teron en decembro, januaro kaj februaro. Sed  la monato septembro sxajnas tre agrabla, pro siaj multaj plezuroj. La  viroj laboras energie en la kampoj, de la mateno gxis la vespero. Ili  rikoltas la flavan grenon, kaj kolektas la fruktojn. Sed je dimancxo oni  ne laboras tiel energie, sed dormas gxis malfrua horo, tial ke je tiu  tago oni ripozas. Je lundo oni komencas labori tre frue, kaj je mardo  oni ankaux laboras energie. En septembro la vojoj ne estas tro kotaj,  kaj longaj promenoj estas ofte agrablaj. Ju pli ofte mi promenas kun  miaj amikoj, des pli multe mi sxatas tiajn promenojn. Sed hieraux mi  estis tre laca post la promeno, tial mi ripozis sur granda mola segxo.  Antaux ne longe la patro promenis kun mi, sed ni ne estis tiel lacaj je  tiu tago. Sxajnas ke ju pli ofte ni promenas, des malpli lacaj ni estas  post la promenoj. Post ne longe mi estos pli forta.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Many years ago we had a small house across the river. 2. We did not  remain there during the entire year, but only in the warmer months of  the summer. 3. Often we stayed until September or even until October. 4.  My younger brothers and sisters amused themselves very well there from  (the) morning until (the) evening. 5. They amused themselves among the  flowers and trees, or went from there into the large fields. 6. Here the  men work energetically, and harvest the ripe yellow grain. 7. Only on  Sunday do they rest, because on that day one does not work. 8. Between  August and November the men work more than in the winter. 9. In December  and after that month they rest, for (83) from that time the frost, ice  and snow cover the ground. 10. Because of the snow on the ground, long  walks are not pleasant in the winter. 11. Recently (90) we went walking  in the park across the river, but we were so tired after that walk! 12.  The longer the walk is, the sooner one wishes to rest. 13. On Monday it  rained, so (78) we read stories and wrote letters, in a pleasant light  room in our house. 14. Before evening, however, the sun shone, and the  streets were not so muddy. 15. On Tuesday these streets were almost dry,  and soon the roads near the river and between the fields will also be  dry. 16. A few years ago those roads were very good.                                      LESSON XXI.                              THE ACCUSATIVE OF TIME.    91. Duration of time and a date or point in time may be expressed  not only by use of the prepositions \"dum\", during, and \"je\", at, on,  but also (as in English) without the use of any preposition. When no  preposition is used, the word or words indicating time are put in the  accusative case:       Li restis tie la tutan semajnon (dum la tuta semajno),        he stayed there the whole week (during the whole week).     Sxi estis felicxa longan tempon (dum longa tempo),        she was happy a long time (during a long time; for a long time).     Ni rajdos tagon kaj nokton (dum tago kaj nokto),        we shall ride a day and a night (during a day and a night;        for a day and a night).     Mi venis dimancxon (je dimancxo), I came Sunday (on Sunday).     Tiun horon (je tiu horo), li forkuris,        that hour (at that hour) he escaped.    92. Although generally preferable, an accusative construction must  be carefully placed, or avoided altogether, if confusion with other  accusatives (expressing direction of motion, direct object, etc.) might  result:       Mi volas iri Bostonon je lundo, I wish to go to Boston on Monday.     Mi volas iri al Bostono lundon, I wish to go to Boston Monday.     Lundon mi volas iri Bostonon, Monday I wish to go to Boston.                        ADVERBS AND THE ACCUSATIVE OF TIME.    93. An accusative of time, as well as a temporal adverb, may further  define or be defined by another expression of time:       Li venis longan tempon antaux tiu horo,        he came a long time before that hour.     Jaron post jaro ili restis tie,        year after year they stayed there.     hodiaux matene, this morning.     hodiaux vespere, this evening.     hodiaux nokte, tonight.     hieraux vespere, last evening.     hieraux nokte, last night.     dimancxon matene, Sunday morning.     lundon vespere, Monday evening.     mardon nokte, Tuesday night.    94. An accusative of time does not necessarily imply that the act or  state mentioned occurs oftener than the instance cited. An adverb from  the same root usually gives an idea of frequency or repetition:       Li iros al ilia domo dimancxon, he will go to their house Sunday.     Li iras al ilia domo dimancxe, he goes to their house Sundays.     Li laboris tagon kaj nokton, he worked a day and a night.     Li laboras tage kaj nokte,        he works day and night (by day and by night).                               THE PREPOSITION \"POR\".    95. The object or purpose with reference to which an act is performed  or a condition exists is expressed by the preposition \"por\", for. It  directs the thought toward its complement, contrasting thus with \"pro\"  (86):       Mi havas libron por vi, I have a book for you.     Mi ne havas la tempon por tiel longa promeno,        I have not the time for so long a (such a long) walk.     Ili faris gxin por via plezuro, they did it for your pleasure.                                     VOCABULARY       brila = brilliant.                 merkredo = Wednesday.     Dio = God.                         mezo = middle.     dividi = to divide.                mondo = world.     fari = to make.                    paci = to be at peace.     forgesi = to forget.               por = for (95).     gxojo = joy.                       plori = to weep.     konstanta = constant.              preta = ready.     kvieta = quiet, calm.              ridi = to laugh.     lando = land, country.             riprocxi = to reproach.                              LA SEZONOJ KAJ LA MONDO.    Antaux tre longa tempo Dio faris la mondon. Li vidis ke la floroj  havas belajn kolorojn, ke la arboj estas altaj kaj verdaj. Tiam li  vokis la sezonojn kaj diris \"Belan mondon mi faris por vi. Cxu vi  gardos gxin tage kaj nokte, kaj estos tre zorgaj pri gxi?\" La sezonoj  respondis \"Jes,\" kaj ridis pro gxojo. Mallongan tempon ili sxajnis  esti tre felicxaj inter la arboj kaj floroj de la nova mondo. Sed ne  multajn semajnojn ili tiel zorge gardis la mondon. Ili komencis malpaci  (\"quarrel\") inter si, de la mateno gxis la vespero, kaj ofte forgesis  la arbojn kaj florojn. Ju pli ili malpacis, des malpli zorge ili gardis  la mondon. La malkonstanta printempo ne sxatis la kvietan vintron, kaj  ploris pri la malvarma negxo. La varma brila somero diris ke la auxtuno  estas tro malbrila. La laca auxtuno volis ripozi, kaj riprocxis la  malkonstantan printempon pri cxi ties kota vetero. Pli kaj pli multe ili  malpacis, kaj post ne longe ili tute ne restis amikoj. Tiam la auxtuno  diris \"Mi ne povas pli longan tempon labori kun vi pro la mondo. Niaj  gustoj estas tro diversaj. Tial hodiaux"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#14)"],[1,"as to the  safety of the great ship's people, not one thing more was known save  that she was drifting, broken and helpless and alone in the midst of a  waste of ice. And it was not until seventeen hours after the Titanic  had sunk that the words came out of the air as to her fate. There was a  confusion and tangle of messages--a jumble of rumors. Good tidings were  trodden upon by evil. And no man knew clearly what was taking place in  that stretch of waters where the giant icebergs were making a mock of  all that the world knew best in ship-building.      TITANIC SENT OUT NO MORE NEWS    It was at 12.17 A. M., while the Virginian was still plunging eastward,  that all communication from the Titanic ceased. The Virginian's  operator, with the Virginian's captain at his elbow, fed the air with  blue flashes in a desperate effort to know what was happening to the  crippled liner, but no message came back. The last word from the Titanic  was that she was sinking. Then the sparking became fainter. The call  was dying to nothing. The Virginian's operator labored over a blur of  signals. It was hopeless. So the Allan ship strove on, fearing that the  worst had happened.    It was this ominous silence that so alarmed the other vessels hurrying  to the Titanic and that caused so much suspense here.        CHAPTER IX. IN THE DRIFTING LIFE-BOATS    SORROW AND SUFFERING--THE SURVIVORS SEE THE TITANIC GO DOWN WITH THEIR  LOVED ONES ON BOARD--A NIGHT OF AGONIZING SUSPENSE--WOMEN HELP TO  ROW--HELP ARRIVES--PICKING UP THE LIFE-BOATS    SIXTEEN boats were in the procession which entered on the terrible hours  of rowing, drifting and suspense. Women wept for lost husbands and sons,  sailors sobbed for the ship which had been their pride. Men choked back  tears and sought to comfort the widowed. Perhaps, they said, other boats  might have put off in another direction. They strove, though none too  sure themselves, to convince the women of the certainty that a rescue  ship would appear.    In the distance the Titanic looked an enormous length, her great bulk  outlined in black against the starry sky, every port-hole and saloon  blazing with light. It was impossible to think anything could be wrong  with such a leviathan, were it not for that ominous tilt downwards in  the bows, where the water was now up to the lowest row of port-holes.  Presently, about 2 A. M., as near as can be determined, those in the  life-boats observed her settling very rapidly with the bows and the  bridge completely under water, and concluded it was now only a question  of minutes before she went. So it proved She slowly tilted straight on  end with the stern vertically upwards, and as she did, the lights in  the cabins and saloons, which until then had not flickered for a moment,  died out, came on again for a single flash, and finally went altogether.  At the same time the machinery roared down through the vessel with a  rattle and a groaning that could be heard for miles, the weirdest sound  surely that could be heard in the middle of the ocean, a thousand miles  away from land. But this was not yet quite the end.      TITANIC STOOD UPRIGHT    To the amazement of the awed watchers in the life-boats, the doomed  vessel remained in that upright position for a time estimated at five  minutes; some in the boat say less, but it was certainly some minutes  that at least 150 feet of the Titanic towered up above the level of the  sea and loomed black against the sky.      SAW LAST OF BIG SHIP    Then with a quiet, slanting dive she disappeared beneath the waters, and  the eyes of the helpless spectators had looked for the last time upon  the gigantic vessel on which they had set out from Southampton. And  there was left to the survivors only the gently heaving sea, the  life-boats filled with men and women in every conceivable condition of  dress and undress, above the perfect sky of brilliant stars with not a  cloud, all tempered with a bitter cold that made each man and woman long  to be one of the crew who toiled away with the oars and kept themselves  warm thereby--a curious, deadening; bitter cold unlike anything they had  felt before.      \"ONE LONG MOAN\"    And then with all these there fell on the ear the most appalling  noise that human being has ever listened to--the cries of hundreds of  fellow-beings struggling in the icy cold water, crying for help with a  cry that could not be answered.    Third Officer Herbert John Pitman, in charge of one of the boats,  described this cry of agony in his testimony before the Senatorial  Investigating Committee, under the questioning of Senator Smith:    \"I heard no cries of distress until after the ship went down,\" he said.    \"How far away were the cries from your life-boat?\"    \"Several hundred yards, probably, some of them.\"    \"Describe the screams.\"    \"Don't, sir, please! I'd rather not talk about it.\"    \"I'm sorry to press it, but what was it like? Were the screams  spasmodic?\"    \"It was one long continuous moan.\"    The witness said the moans and cries continued an hour.    Those in the life-boats longed to return and pick up some of the poor  drowning souls, but they feared this would mean swamping the boats and a  further loss of life.    Some of the men tried to sing to keep the women from hearing the cries,  and rowed hard to get away from the scene of the wreck, but the memory  of those sounds will be one of the things the rescued will find it  difficult to forget.    The waiting sufferers kept a lookout for lights, and several times it  was shouted that steamers' lights were seen, but they turned out to be  either a light from another boat or a star low down on the horizon. It  was hard to keep up hope.      WOMEN TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE    \"Let me go back--I want to go back to my husband--I'll jump from the  boat if you don't,\" cried an agonized voice in one life-boat.    \"You can do no good by going back--other lives will be lost if you try  to do it. Try to calm yourself for the sake of the living. It may be  that your husband will be picked up somewhere by one of the fishing  boats.\"    The woman who pleaded to go back, according to Mrs. Vera Dick, of  Calgary, Canada, later tried to throw herself from the life-boat. Mrs.  Dick, describing the scenes in the life-boats, said there were half  a dozen women in that one boat who tried to commit suicide when they  realized that the Titanic had gone down.    \"Even in Canada, where we have such clear nights,\" said Mrs. Dick, \"I  have never seen such a clear sky. The stars were very bright and we  could see the Titanic plainly, like a great hotel on the water. Floor  after floor of the lights went out as we watched. It was horrible,  horrible. I can't bear to think about it. From the distance, as we rowed  away, we could hear the band playing 'Nearer, My God to Thee.'    \"Among the life-boats themselves, however, there were scenes just as  terrible, perhaps, but to me nothing could outdo the tragic grandeur  with which the Titanic went to its death. To realize it, you would  have to see the Titanic as I saw it the day we set sail--with the  flags flying and the bands playing. Everybody on board was laughing and  talking about the Titanic being the biggest and most luxurious boat on  the ocean and being unsinkable. To think of it then and to think of it  standing out there in the night, wounded to death and gasping for life,  is almost too big for the imagination.      SCANTILY CLAD WOMEN IN LIFE-BOATS    \"The women on our boat were in nightgowns and bare feet--some of  them--and the wealthiest women mingled with the poorest immigrants. One  immigrant woman kept shouting: 'My God, my poor father! He put me in  this boat and would not save himself. Oh, why didn't I die, why didn't I  die? Why can't I die now?'    \"We had to restrain her, else she would have jumped over-board. It was  simply awful. Some of the men apparently had said they could row just to  get into the boats. We paid no attention to cowardice, however. We were  all busy with our own troubles. My heart simply bled for the women who  were separated from their husbands.    \"The night was frightfully cold, although clear. We had to huddle  together to keep warm. Everybody drank sparingly of the water and  ate sparingly of the bread. We did not know when we would be saved.  Everybody tried to remain cool, except the poor creatures who could  think of nothing but their own great loss. Those with the most brains  seemed to control themselves best.\"      PHILADELPHIA WOMEN HEROINES    How Mrs. George D. Widener, whose husband and son perished after kissing  her good-bye and helping her into one of the boats, rowed when exhausted  seamen were on the verge of collapse, was told by Emily Geiger, maid of  Mrs. Widener, who was saved with her.    The girl said Mrs. Widener bravely toiled throughout the night and  consoled other women who had broken down under the strain.    Mrs. William E. Carter and Mrs. John B. Thayer were in the same  life-boat and worked heroically to keep it free from the icy menace.  Although Mrs. Thayer's husband remained aboard the Titanic and sank with  it, and although she had no knowledge of the safety of her son until  they met, hours later, aboard the Carpathia, Mrs. Thayer bravely labored  at the oars throughout the night.    In telling of her experience Mrs. Carter said:    \"When I went over the side with my children and got in the boat there  were no seamen in it. Then came a few men, but there were oars with no  one to use them. The boat had been filled with passengers, and there was  nothing else for me to do but to take an oar.    \"We could see now that the time of the ship had come. She was sinking,  and we were warned by cries from the men above to pull away from  the ship quickly. Mrs. Thayer, wife of the vice-president of the  Pennsylvania Railroad, was in my boat, and she, too, took an oar.    \"It was cold and we had no time to clothe ourselves with "]]]
