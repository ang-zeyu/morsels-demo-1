The Florentine artists to whose studios he went began to notice the  hardworking boy, and when they looked at his work, with all its faults  and want of finish, they saw in it that divine something called genius  which no one can mistake.    Then the doors of another world seemed to open to Pietro. All day long  he could now work at his beloved painting and learn fresh wonders as he  watched the great men use the brush and pencil. In the studio of the  painter Verocchio he met the men of whose fame he had so often heard,  and whose work he looked upon with awe and reverence.    There was the good-tempered monk of the Carmine, Fra Filipo Lippi, the  young Botticelli, and a youth just his own age whom they called  Leonardo da Vinci, of whom it was whispered already that he would some  day be the greatest master of the age.    These were golden days for Perugino, as he was called, for the name of  the city where he had come from was always now given to him. The  pictures he had longed to paint grew beneath his hand, and upon his  canvas began to dawn the solemn dignity and open-air spaciousness of  those evening visions he had seen when he gazed across the Umbrian  Plain. There was no noise of battle, no human passion in his pictures.  His saints stood quiet and solemn, single figures with just a thread of  interest binding them together, and always beyond was the great wide  open world, with the white light shining in the sky, the blue thread of  the river, and the single trees pointing upwards--dark, solemn cypress,  or feathery larch or poplar.    There was much for the young painter still to learn, and perhaps he  learned most from the silent teaching of that little dark chapel of the  Carmine, where Masaccio taught more wonderful lessons by his frescoes  than any living artist could teach.    Then came the crowning honour when Perugino received an invitation from  the Pope to go to Rome and paint the walls of the Sistine Chapel. Hence  forth it was a different kind of life for the young painter. No need to  wonder where he would get his next meal, no hard rough wooden chest on  which to rest his weary limbs when the day's work was done. Now he was  royally entertained and softly lodged, and men counted it an honour to  be in his company.    But though he loved Florence and was proud to do his painting in Rome,  his heart ever drew him back to the city on the hill whose name he bore.    Again he travelled along the winding road, and his heart beat fast as  he drew nearer and saw the familiar towers and roofs of Perugia. How  well he remembered that long-ago day when the cool touch of the grass  was so grateful to his little tired dusty feet! He stooped again to  fill his hands with the sweet violets, and thought them sweeter than  all the fame and fair show of the gay cities.    And as he passed through the ancient gateway and threaded his way up  the narrow street towards the little shop, he seemed to see once more  the kindly smile of his old master and to hear him say, 'Thou wilt soon  be the greatest man in Perugia, and we will call thee no longer Pietro  Vanucci, but Perugino.'    So it had come to pass. Here he was. No longer a little ragged, hungry  boy, but a man whom all delighted to honour. Truly this was a world of  changes!    A bigger studio was needed than the little old shop, for now he had  more pictures to paint than he well knew how to finish. Then, too, he  had many pupils, for all were eager to enter the studio of the great  master. There it was that one morning a new pupil was brought to him, a  boy of twelve, whose guardians begged that Perugino would teach and  train him.    Perugino looked with interest at the child. Seldom had he seen such a  beautiful oval face, framed by such soft brown curls--a face so pure  and lovable that even at first sight it drew out love from the hearts  of those who looked at him.    'His father was also a painter,' said the guardian, 'and Raphael, here,  has caught the trick of using his pencil and brush, so we would have  him learn of the greatest master in the land.'    After some talk, the boy was left in the studio at Perugia, and day by  day Perugino grew to love him more. It was not only that little Raphael  was clever and skilful, though that alone often made the master marvel.    'He is my pupil now, but some day he will be my master, and I shall  learn of him,' Perugino would often say as he watched the boy at work.  But more than all, the pure sweet nature and the polished gentleness of  his manners charmed the heart of the master, and he loved to have the  boy always near him, and to teach him was his greatest pleasure.    Those quiet days in the Perugia studio never lasted very long. From all  quarters came calls to Perugino, and, much as he loved work, he could  not finish all that was wanted.    It happened once when he was in Florence that a certain prior begged  him to come and fresco the walls of his convent. This prior was very  famous for making a most beautiful and expensive blue colour which he  was anxious should be used in the painting of the convent walls. He was  a mean, suspicious man, and would not trust Perugino with the precious  blue colour, but always held it in his own hands and grudgingly doled  it out in small quantities, torn between the desire to have the colour  on his walls and his dislike to parting with anything so precious.    As Perugino noted this, he grew angry and determined to punish the  prior's meanness. The next time therefore that there was a blue sky to  be painted, he put at his side a large bowl of fresh water, and then  called on the prior to put out a small quantity of the blue colour in a  little vase. Each time he dipped his brush into the vase, Perugino  washed it out with a swirl in the bowl at his side, so that most of the  colour was left in the water, and very little was put on to the picture.    'I pray thee fill the vase again with blue,' he said carelessly when  the colour was all gone. The prior groaned aloud, and turned grudgingly  to his little bag.    'Oh what a quantity of blue is swallowed up by this plaster!' he said,  as he gazed at the white wall, which scarcely showed a trace of the  precious colour.    'Yes,' said Perugino cheerfully, 'thou canst see thyself how it goes.'    Then afterwards, when the prior had sadly gone off with his little  empty bag, Perugino carefully poured the water from the bowl and  gathered together the grains of colour which had sunk to the bottom.    'Here is something that belongs to thee,' he said sternly to the  astonished prior. 'I would have thee learn to trust honest men and not  treat them as thieves. For with all thy suspicious care, it was easy to  rob thee if I had had a mind.'    During all these years in which Perugino had worked so diligently, the  art of painting had been growing rapidly. Many of the new artists shook  off the old rules and ideas, and began to paint in quite a new way.  There was one man especially, called Michelangelo, whose story you will  hear later on, who arose like a giant, and with his new way and greater  knowledge swept everything before him.    Perugino was jealous of all these new ideas, and clung more closely  than ever to his old ideals, his quiet, dignified saints, and spacious  landscapes. He talked openly of his dislike of the new style, and once  he had a serious quarrel with the great Michelangelo.    There was a gathering of painters in Perugino's studio that day.  Filippino Lippi, Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, and Leonardo were there, and  in the background the pupil Raphael was listening to the talk.    'What dost thou think of this new style of painting?' asked Botticelli.  'To me it seems but strange and unpleasing. Music and motion are  delightful, but this violent twisting of limbs to show the muscles  offends my taste.'    'Yet it is most marvellously skilful,' said the young Leonardo  thoughtfully.    'But totally unfit for the proper picturing of saints and the blessed  Madonna,' said Filippino, shaking his curly head.    'I never trouble myself about it,' said Ghirlandaio. 'Life is too short  to attend to other men's work. It takes all my care and attention to  look after mine own. But see, here comes the great Michelangelo himself  to listen to our criticism.'    The curious, rugged face of the great artist looked good-naturedly on  the company, but his strong knotted hands waved aside their greetings.    'So you were busy as usual finding fault with my work,' he said. 'Come,  friend Perugino, tell me what thou hast found to grumble at.'    'I like not thy methods, and that I tell thee frankly,' answered  Perugino, an angry light shining in his eyes. 'It is such work as thine  that drags the art of painting down from the heights of heavenly things  to the low taste of earth. It robs it of all dignity and restfulness,  and destroys the precious traditions handed down to us since the days  of Giotto.'    The face of Michelangelo grew angry and scornful as he listened to this.    'Thou art but a dolt and a blockhead in Art,' he said. 'Thou wilt soon  see that the day of thy saints and Madonnas is past, and wilt cease to  paint them over and over again in the same manner, as a child doth his  lesson in a copy book.'    Then he turned and went out of the studio before any one had time to  answer him.    Perugino was furiously angry and would not listen to reason, but must  needs go before the great Council and demand that they should punish  Michelangelo for his hard words. This of course the Council refused to  do, and Perugino left Florence for Perugia, angry and sore at heart.    It seemed hard, after all his struggles and great successes, that as he  grew old people should begin to tire of his work, which they had once  thought so perfect.    But if the outside world was sometimes disappointing, he had always his  home to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#14)"],[1,"you do with the cross?\" That young ass, Kurzen Mantl, winked at  him, but I saw him, and he knew that I did. A pause ensued, and then he  offered me snuff, saying, \"There, show that you don't care a pinch of  snuff for it.\" I still said nothing. At length he began once more in  a sneering tone: \"I may then send to you to-morrow, and you will be so  good as to lend me the cross for a few minutes, and I will return it  immediately after I have spoken to the goldsmith about it. I know that  when I ask him its value (for he is a queer kind of man) he will say  a Bavarian thaler; it can't be worth more, for it is not gold, only  copper, ha! ha!\" I said, \"By no means--it is lead, ha! ha!\" I was  burning with anger and rage. \"I say,\" rejoined he, \"I suppose I may,  if need be, leave out the spur?\" \"Oh, yes,\" said I, \"for you have one  already in your head; I, too, have one in mine, but of a very different  kind, and I should be sorry to exchange mine for yours; so there, take  a pinch of snuff on that!\" and I offered him snuff. He became pale with  rage, but began again: \"Just now that order looked so well on that grand  waistcoat of yours.\" I made no reply, so he called the servant and said  \"Hallo! you must have greater respect for my brother-in-law and myself  when we wear the same cross as Herr Mozart; take a pinch of snuff on  that!\" I started up; all did the same, and showed great embarrassment.  I took my hat and my sword, and said, \"I hope to have the pleasure of  seeing you to-morrow.\" \"To-morrow I shall not be here.\" \"Well, then,  the next morning, when I shall still be here.\" \"Ho, ho! you surely don't  mean to\"--\"I mean nothing; you are a set of boors, so good-night,\" and  off I went.    Next day I told the whole story to Herr Stein, Herr Geniaulx, and  to Herr Director Graf--I don't mean about the cross, but how highly  disgusted I was at their having bragged so much about a concert, and  now it had come to nothing. \"I call this making a fool of a person and  leaving him in the lurch. I am very sorry that I ever came here. I could  not possibly have believed that in Augsburg, my papa's native town, such  an insult could have been offered to his son.\" You cannot imagine, dear  papa, how angry and indignant these three gentlemen were, saying, \"Oh,  you must positively give a concert here; we don't stand in need of  the patricians.\" I, however, adhered to my resolution and said, \"I am  willing to give a small farewell concert at Herr Stein's, for my  few kind friends here who are connoisseurs.\" The Director was quite  distressed, and exclaimed, \"It is abominable--shameful; who could have  believed such a thing of Langenmantl! Par Dieu! if he really wished it,  no doubt it would have been carried through.\" We then separated. The  Director went down-stairs with me in his dressing-gown as far as the  door, and Herr Stein and Geniaulx walked home with me. They urged us to  make up our mind to stay here for a time, but we remained firm. I must  not forget to say that, when young Langenmantl lisped out to me, in  his usual cool indifferent way, the pleasant news as to my concert, he  added, that the patricians invited me to their concert next Thursday. I  said, \"I will come as one of the audience.\" \"Oh, we hope you will give  us the pleasure of hearing you play also.\" \"Well, perhaps I may; why  not?\" But having received so grievous an insult the next evening, I  resolved not to go near him again, to steer clear of the whole set of  patricians, and to leave Augsburg. During dinner, on the 16th, I was  called out by a servant-maid of Langenmantl's, who wished to know  whether he might expect me to go with him to the concert? and he begged  I would come to him immediately after dinner. I sent my compliments in  return, that I had no intention of going to the concert; nor could I  come to him, as I was already engaged (which was quite true); but that  I would call next morning to take leave of him, as on Saturday next, at  furthest, I was to leave Augsburg. In the meantime Herr Stein had been  to see the other patricians of the Evangelical party, and spoke so  strongly to them that these gentlemen were quite excited. \"What!\" said  they, \"shall we permit a man who does us so much honor to leave this  without even hearing him? Herr von Langenmantl, having already heard  him, thinks that is enough.\"    At last they became so excited that Herr Kurzenmantl, the excellent  youth, was obliged to go to Herr Stein himself to entreat him, in the  name of the patricians, to do all in his power to persuade me to attend  the concert, but to say that I must not expect great things. At last  I went with him, though with considerable reluctance. The principal  gentlemen were very polite, particularly Baron Belling, who is a  director or some such animal; he opened my music-portfolio himself. I  brought a symphony with me, which they played, and I took a violin part.  The orchestra is enough to throw any one into fits. That young puppy  Langenmantl was all courtesy, but his face looked as impertinent as  ever; he said to me, \"I was rather afraid you might have escaped us,  or been offended by our jokes the other evening.\" \"By no means,\" said I  coolly; \"you are still very young; but I advise you to be more cautious  in future, for I am not accustomed to such jokes. The subject on which  you were so facetious did you no credit, nor did it answer your purpose,  for you see I still wear the order; you had better have chosen some  other topic for your wit.\" \"I assure you,\" said he, \"it was only my  brother-in-law who\"--\"Let us say no more about it,\" said I. \"We had  nearly been deprived of the pleasure of seeing you altogether,\" he  rejoined. \"Yes; had it not been for Herr Stein, I certainly should not  have come; and, to tell you the truth, I am only here now to prevent you  Augsburg gentlemen being the laughing-stock of other countries, which  would have been the case if I had told them that I was eight days in the  city where my father was born, without any one there taking the trouble  to hear me!\" I played a concerto, and all went off well except the  accompaniment; and as a finale I played a sonata. At the close, Baron  Belling thanked me in the warmest manner in the name of all the company;  and, begging me to consider only their good will, presented me with two  ducats.    They give me no peace here till I agree to give a public concert next  Saturday. Perhaps--but I own I am heartily sick of it all. I shall be  indeed glad when I arrive at a place where there is a court. I may with  truth say that, were it not for my kind cousins, my regrets would be as  numberless as the hairs on my head for ever having come to Augsburg. I  must write you some account of my fair cousin, but you must excuse my  deferring this till to-morrow, for one ought to be quite fresh to praise  her as highly as she deserves.    The 17th.--I now write early in the morning to say that my cousin is  pretty, intelligent, lovable, clever, and gay, probably because she  has lived so much in society; she was also some time at Munich. We do,  indeed, exactly suit each other, for she too is rather inclined to be  satirical, so we banter our friends most merrily together. [The Mozart  family were both well known and dreaded for their somewhat sharp  tongues.]        67.    Augsburg, Oct. 17, 1777.    I must now tell you about the Stein pianos. Before seeing these, Spath's  pianos were my favorites; but I must own that I give the preference to  those of Stein, for they damp much better than those in Ratisbon. If I  strike hard, whether I let my fingers rest on the notes or lift them,  the tone dies away at the same instant that it is heard. Strike the  keys as I choose, the tone always remains even, never either jarring or  failing to sound. It is true that a piano of this kind is not to be had  for less than three hundred florins, but the pains and skill which Stein  bestows on them cannot be sufficiently repaid. His instruments have a  feature of their own; they are supplied with a peculiar escapement.  Not one in a hundred makers attends to this; but, without it, it is  impossible that a piano should not buzz and jar. His hammers fall as  soon as they touch the strings, whether the keys be held down by the  fingers or not. When he has completed an instrument of this class,  (which he told me himself,) he tries all kinds of passages and runs on  it, and works away at it, testing its powers till it is capable of doing  anything, for he labors not for his own benefit alone, (or he might be  saved much trouble,) but for that of music. He often says, \"If I were  not such a passionate lover of music, playing also myself a little on  the piano, I should long ago have lost patience with my work, but I like  my instruments to respond to the player, and to be durable.\" His pianos  do really last well. He warrants the sounding-board neither breaking nor  cracking; when he has finished one, he exposes it in the air to rain,  snow, sun, and every kind of devilry, that it may give way, and then  inserts slips of wood which he glues in, making it quite strong and  solid. He is very glad when it does crack, for then he is pretty sure  nothing further can happen to it. He frequently makes cuts into them  himself, and then glues them up, thus making them doubly strong. He  has three of these pianos at this moment finished, and I played on them  again to-day.    We dined to-day with young Herr Gassner, who is the handsome widower  of a lovely young wife; they were only married two years. He is an  excellent and kind young man; he gave us a capital dinner. A colleague  of the Abbe Henri Bullinger, and Wishofer also dined there, and an  ex-Jesuit, who is at present Capellmeister in the cathedral here. He  knows Herr Schachtner well [court-trumpeter at Salzburg], and was leader  of his band in Ingolstadt; he is called Father Gerbl. Herr Gassner, and  one of his wife's unmarried"]]]
