During this affright, Germanicus was by all men censured, \"that he  retired not to the higher army, whence he had been sure of ready  obedience, and even of succour against the revolters: already he had  taken wrong measures more than enow, by discharging some, rewarding all,  and other tender counsels; if he despised his own safety, yet why expose  his infant son, why his wife big with child, to the fury of outrageous  traitors, wantonly violating all the most sacred rights amongst men? It  became him at least to restore his wife and son safe to Tiberius and  to the State.\" He was long unresolved; besides Agrippina was averse to  leave him, and urged, that \"she was the grand-daughter of Augustus, and  it was below her spirit to shrink in a time of danger.\" But embracing  her and their little son, with great tenderness and many tears, he  prevailed with her to depart. Thus there marched miserably along a band  of helpless women: the wife of a great commander fled like a fugitive,  and upon her bosom bore her infant son: about her a troop of other  ladies, dragged from their husbands, and drowned in tears, uttering  their heavy lamentations; nor weaker than theirs was the grief felt by  all who remained.    These groans and tears, and this spectacle of woe, the appearances  rather of a city stormed and sacked, than of a Roman camp, that of  Germanicus Caesar, victorious and flourishing, awakened attention and  inquiry in the soldiers: leaving their tents, they cried, \"Whence these  doleful wailings? what so lamentable! so many ladies of illustrious  quality, travelling thus forlorn; not a Centurion to attend them; not  a soldier to guard them; their General's wife amongst them,  undistinguished by any mark of her princely dignity; destitute of her  ordinary train; frightened from the Roman legions, and repairing, like  an exile, for shelter to Treves, there to commit herself to the faith  of foreigners.\" Hence shame and commiseration seized them, and the  remembrance of her illustrious family, with that of her own virtues;  the brave Agrippa her father; the mighty Augustus her grandfather; the  amiable Drusus her father-in-law, herself celebrated for a fruitful bed,  and of signal chastity: add the consideration of her little son, born  in the camp, nursed in the arms of the legions, and by themselves named  Caligula, a military name from the boots which of the same fashion  with their own, in compliment to them, and to win their affections, he  frequently wore. But nothing so effectually subdued them as their own  envy towards the inhabitants of Treves: hence they all besought, all  adjured, that she would return to themselves, and with themselves  remain: thus some stopped Agrippina; but the main body returned with  their entreaties to Germanicus, who, as he was yet in the transports  of grief and anger, addressed himself on this wise to the surrounding  crowd.    \"To me neither is my wife or son dearer than my father and the  Commonwealth. But him doubtless the majesty of his name will defend; and  there are other armies, loyal armies, to defend the Roman State. As to  my wife and children, whom for your glory I could freely sacrifice, I  now remove them from your rage; that by my blood alone may be expiated  whatever further mischief your fury meditates; and that the murder of  the great grandson of Augustus, the murder of the daughter-in-law of  Tiberius, may not be added to mine, nor to the blackness of your past  guilt. For, during these days of frenzy what has been too horrid for you  to commit? What so sacred that you have not violated? To this audience  what name shall I give? Can I call you _soldiers_? you who have beset  with arms the son of your Emperor, confined him in your trenches, and  held him in a siege? _Roman citizens_ can I call you? you who  have trampled upon the supreme authority of the Roman Senate? Laws  religiously observed by common enemies, you have profaned; violated  the sacred privileges, and persons of Ambassadors; broken the laws of  nations. The deified Julius Caesar quelled a sedition in his army by a  single word: he called all who refused to follow him, _townsmen_. The  deified Augustus, when, after the battle of Actium, the legions who won  it lapsed into mutiny, terrified them into submission by the dignity  of his presence and an awful look. These, it is true, are mighty and  immortal names, whom I dare not emulate; but, as I am their descendant,  and inherit their blood, should the armies in Syria and Spain reject my  orders, and contemn my authority, I should think their behaviour strange  and base: are not the present legions under stronger ties than those in  Syria and Spain? You are the first and the twentieth legions; the former  enrolled by Tiberius himself; the other his constant companions in so  many battles, his partners in so many victories, and by him enriched  with so many bounties! Is this the worthy return you make your Emperor,  and late Commander, for the distinction he has shown you, for the favour  he has done you, and for his liberalities towards you? And shall I be  the author of such tidings to him; such heavy tidings in the midst of  congratulations and happy accounts from every province in the Empire?  Must it be my sad task to acquaint him that his own new levies, as well  as his own veterans who long fought under him; these not appeased by  their discharge, and neither of them satiated with the money given them,  are both still combined in a furious mutiny? must I tell him that here  and only here the Centurions are butchered, the Tribunes driven away,  the Ambassadors imprisoned; that with blood the camp is stained, and  the rivers flow with blood; and that for me his son, I hold a precarious  life at the mercy of men, who owe me duty, and practise enmity?    \"Why did you the other day, oh unseasonable and too officious friends!  why did you leave me at their mercy by snatching from me my sword, when  with it I would have put myself out of their power? He who offered me  his own sword showed greater kindness, and was more my friend. I would  then have fallen happy; happy that my death would have hid from mine  eyes so many horrible crimes since committed by my own army; and for  you, you would have chosen another general, such a general, no doubt, as  would have left my death unpunished, but still one who would have sought  vengeance for that of Varus and the three legions; for the Gods are too  just to permit that ever the Belgians, however generously they offer  their service, shall reap the credit and renown of retrieving the glory  of the Roman name, and of reducing in behalf of Rome the German nations  her foes. Filled with this passion for the glory of Rome, I here  invoke thy spirit now with the Gods, oh deified Augustus; and thy image  interwoven in the ensigns, and thy memory, oh deceased father. Let thy  revered spirit, oh Augustus, let thy loved image and memory, oh Drusus,  still dear to these legions, vindicate them from this guilty stain,  this foul infamy of leaving to foreigners the honour of defending  and avenging the Roman State. They are Romans; they already feel the  remorses of shame; they are already stimulated with a sense of honour:  improve, oh improve this generous disposition in them; that thus  inspired they may turn the whole tide of their civil rage to the  destruction of their common enemy. And for you, my fellow-soldiers,  in whom I behold all the marks of compunction, other countenances,  and minds happily changed; if you mean to restore to the Senate its  ambassadors; to your Emperor your sworn obedience; to me, your general,  my wife and son; be it the first instance of your duty, to fly the  contagious company of incendiaries, to separate the sober from the  seditious: this will be a faithful sign of remorse, this a firm pledge  of fidelity.\"    These words softened them into supplicants: they confessed that all  his reproaches were true; they besought him to punish the guilty and  malicious, to pardon the weak and misled, and to lead them against the  enemy; to recall his wife, to bring back his son, nor to suffer the  fosterling of the legions to be given in hostage to the Gauls. Against  the recalling of Agrippina he alleged the advance of winter, and her  approaching delivery; but said, that his son should return, and that  to themselves he left to execute what remained further to be executed.  Instantly, with changed resentments, they ran, and seizing the most  seditious, dragged them in bonds to Caius Cretonius, commander of the  first legion, who judged and punished them in this manner. The legions,  with their swords drawn, surrounded the tribunal; from thence the  prisoner was by a Tribune exposed to their view, and if they  proclaimed him guilty, cast headlong down, and executed even by his  fellow-soldiers, who rejoiced in the execution, because by it they  thought their own guilt to be expiated: nor did Germanicus restrain  them, since on themselves remained the cruelty and reproach of the  slaughter committed without any order of his. The veterans followed the  same example of vengeance, and were soon after ordered into Rhetia, in  appearance to defend that province against the invading Suevians; in  reality, to remove them from a camp still horrible to their sight, as  well in the remedy and punishment, as from the memory of their crime.  Germanicus next passed a scrutiny upon the conduct and characters of the  Centurions: before him they were cited singly; and each gave an account  of his name, his company, country, the length of his service, exploits  in war, and military presents, if with any he had been distinguished:  if the Tribunes or his legion bore testimony of his diligence and  integrity, he kept his post; upon concurring complaint of his avarice or  cruelty, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#14)"],[1,"fitly ends with the three Persian  conquerors, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, who thus brought into their huge  empire every great state of Oriental antiquity. Medes and Persians,  Babylonians and Assyrians, Lydians, Syrians, and Egyptians--all were at  length united under a single dominion. In the reign of Darius this united  Orient first comes into contact with the rising power of the Greek states  of Europe. So we may leave its history here, resuming our narrative when  we discuss the momentous conflict between Persia and Greece, which was to  affect the course, not alone of Persian or Greek, but of all European  history.

[7] It is interesting to note that Hebrew tradition (_Genesis_, ii, 8-15)  places Paradise, the garden of God and original home of man, in southern  Babylonia. The ancient name for this district was Edin (Eden).    [8] The problem of regulating the Nile inundation so as to distribute the  water for irrigation when and where it is most needed has been solved by  the building of the Assuan dam. It lies across the head of the first  cataract for a distance of a mile and a quarter, and creates a lake two  hundred and forty miles in length. This great work was completed in 1912  A.D. by the British officials who now control Egypt.    [9] See page 50.    [10] Judges, xvii, 6.    [11] 2 _Kings_, xix, 35.

CHAPTER III    ORIENTAL CIVILIZATION [1]      13. SOCIAL CLASSES    REDISCOVERY OF THE ORIENT    Our present knowledge of the Orient has been gained within recent times.  Less than a century ago no one could read the written records of the  Egyptians and Babylonians. The decipherment of the Rosetta Stone, which  contained an inscription in both Greek and hieroglyphics, led to the  understanding of Egyptian writing. Scholars later succeeded in  interpreting the Babylonian cuneiform script. Modern excavations in the  valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates have now provided them with abundant  material for study in the shape of books and inscriptions. As these are  gradually deciphered, new light is being thrown on all features of ancient  Oriental civilization.    [Illustration: A ROYAL NAME IN HIEROGLYPHICS (ROSETTA STONE)  The cut shows the symbols contained in one of the oval rings, or  _cartouches_, for Ptolemaios, the Greek name of King Ptolemy. Each symbol  represents the initial letter of the Egyptian name for the object  pictured. The objects in order are: a mat, a half-circle, a noose, a lion,  a hole, two reeds, and a chair-back. The entire hieroglyph is read from  left to right, as we read words in English.]    [Illustration: THE ROSETTA STONE.  British Museum, London. A block of black basalt, three feet seven inches  in height, found in 1799 A.D., near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile.]    THE KING AS AUTOCRAT    The Oriental peoples, when their history opens, were living under the  monarchical form of government. The king, to his subjects, was the earthly  representative of the god. Often, indeed, he was himself regarded as  divine. The belief in the king's divine origin made obedience to him a  religious obligation for his subjects. Every Oriental monarch was an  autocrat. Every Oriental monarchy was a despotism.    THE KING'S DUTIES    The king had many duties. He was judge, commander, and high priest, all in  one. In time of war, he led his troops and faced the dangers of the battle  field. During intervals of peace, he was occupied with a constant round of  sacrifices, prayers, and processions, which could not be neglected without  exciting the anger of the gods. To his courtiers he gave frequent  audience, hearing complaints, settling disputes, and issuing commands. A  conscientious monarch, such as Hammurabi, who describes himself as \"a real  father to his people,\" must have been a very busy man.    [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN COURT SCENE  Wall painting from a tomb at Thebes. Shows a Pharaoh receiving Asiatic  envoys bearing tribute. They are introduced by white robed Egyptian  officials. The Asiatics may be distinguished by their gay clothes and  black, sharp pointed beards.]    NOBLES AND PRIESTS    Besides the monarch and the royal family there was generally in Oriental  countries an upper class of landowners. In Egypt the Pharaoh was regarded  as sole owner of the land. Some of it he worked through his slaves, but  the larger part he granted to his favorites, as hereditary estates. Such  persons may be called the nobles. The different priesthoods also had much  land, the revenues from which kept up the temples where they ministered.  In Babylonia, likewise, we find a priesthood and nobility supported by the  income from landed property.    THE MIDDLE CLASS    The middle class included professional men, shopkeepers independent  farmers, and skilled craftsmen. Though regarded as inferiors, still they  had a chance to rise in the world. If they became rich, they might hope to  enter the upper class as priests or government officials.    WORKMEN AND PEASANTS    No such hopes encouraged the day laborer in the fields or shops. His lot  was bitter poverty and a life of unending toil. If he was an unskilled  workman, his wages were only enough to keep him and his family. He toiled  under overseers who carried sticks and used them freely. \"Man has a back,\"  says an Egyptian proverb, \"and only obeys when it is beaten.\" If the  laborer was a peasant, he could be sure that the nobles from whom he  rented the land and the tax collectors of the king would leave him  scarcely more than a bare living.    SLAVES    At the very bottom of the social ladder were the slaves. Every ancient  people possessed them. At first they were prisoners of war, who, instead  of being slaughtered, were made to labor for their masters. At a later  period people unable to pay their debts often became slaves. The treatment  of slaves depended on the character of the master. A cruel and overbearing  owner might make life a burden for his bondmen. Escape was rarely  possible. Slaves were branded like cattle to prevent their running away.  Hammurabi's code [2] imposed the death penalty on anybody who aided or  concealed the fugitives. There was plenty of work for the slaves to  perform--repairing dikes, digging irrigation canals, and erecting vast  palaces and temples. The servile class in Egypt was not as numerous as in  Babylonia, and slavery itself seems to have assumed there a somewhat  milder form.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS    FARMING    Such fruitful, well-watered valleys as those of the Nile and the Euphrates  encouraged agricultural life. Farming was the chief occupation. Working  people, whether slaves or freemen, were generally cultivators of the soil.  All the methods of agriculture are pictured for us on the monuments. We  mark the peasant as he breaks up the earth with a hoe or plows a shallow  furrow with a sharp-pointed stick. We see the sheep being driven across  sown fields to trample the seed into the moist soil. We watch the patient  laborers as with hand sickles they gather in the harvest and then with  heavy flails separate the chaff from the grain. Although their methods  were very clumsy, ancient farmers raised"]]]
