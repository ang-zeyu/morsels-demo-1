He said I was to use it ANY  way I liked, so ma couldn't refuse to let me give it to the fund. She  thinks it's an awful waste, but she always goes by what Uncle Arthur  says. Oh, I've prayed so hard that some money might come some way, and  now it has. See what praying does!\"    I was very much afraid that we did not rejoice quite as unselfishly  in Sara's good fortune as we should have done. WE had earned our  contributions by the sweat of our brow, or by the scarcely less  disagreeable method of \"begging.\" And Sara's had as good as descended  upon her out of the skies, as much like a miracle as anything you could  imagine.    \"She prayed for it, you know,\" said Felix, after Sara had gone home.    \"That's too easy a way of earning money,\" grumbled Peter resentfully.  \"If the rest of us had just set down and done nothing, only prayed, how  much do you s'pose we'd have? It don't seem fair to me.\"    \"Oh, well, it's different with Sara,\" said Dan. \"We COULD earn money and  she COULDN'T. You see? But come on down to the orchard. The Story Girl  had a letter from her father to-day and she's going to read it to us.\"    We went promptly. A letter from the Story Girl's father was always an  event; and to hear her read it was almost as good as hearing her tell a  story.    Before coming to Carlisle, Uncle Blair Stanley had been a mere name  to us. Now he was a personality. His letters to the Story Girl, the  pictures and sketches he sent her, her adoring and frequent mention of  him, all combined to make him very real to us.    We FELT then, what we did not understand till later years, that our  grown-up relatives did not altogether admire or approve of Uncle Blair.  He belonged to a different world from theirs. They had never known him  very intimately or understood him. I realize now that Uncle Blair was a  bit of a Bohemian--a respectable sort of tramp. Had he been a poor man  he might have been a more successful artist. But he had a small fortune  of his own and, lacking the spur of necessity, or of disquieting  ambition, he remained little more than a clever amateur. Once in a while  he painted a picture which showed what he could do; but for the rest,  he was satisfied to wander over the world, light-hearted and content.  We knew that the Story Girl was thought to resemble him strongly in  appearance and temperament, but she had far more fire and intensity and  strength of will--her inheritance from King and Ward. She would never  be satisfied as a dabbler; whatever her future career should be, into it  she would throw all her powers of mind and heart and soul.    But Uncle Blair could do at least one thing surpassingly well. He could  write letters. Such letters! By contrast, Felix and I were secretly  ashamed of father's epistles. Father could talk well but, as Felix said,  he couldn't write worth a cent. The letters we had received from him  since his arrival in Rio de Janeiro were mere scrawls, telling us to be  good boys and not trouble Aunt Janet, incidentally adding that he was  well and lonesome. Felix and I were always glad to get his letters, but  we never read them aloud to an admiring circle in the orchard.    Uncle Blair was spending the summer in Switzerland; and the letter the  Story Girl read to us, among the fair, frail White Ladies of the Walk,  where the west wind came now with a sigh, and again with a rush, and  then brushed our faces as softly as the down of a thistle, was full of  the glamour of mountain-rimmed lakes, and purple chalets, and \"snowy  summits old in story.\" We climbed Mount Blanc, saw the Jungfrau soaring  into cloudland, and walked among the gloomy pillars of Bonnivard's  prison. Finally, the Story Girl told us the tale of the Prisoner of  Chillon, in words that were Byron's, but in a voice that was all her  own.    \"It must be splendid to go to Europe,\" sighed Cecily longingly.    \"I am going some day,\" said the Story Girl airily.    We looked at her with a slightly incredulous awe. To us, in those years,  Europe seemed almost as remote and unreachable as the moon. It was  hard to believe that one of US should ever go there. But Aunt Julia had  gone--and SHE had been brought up in Carlisle on this very farm. So it  was possible that the Story Girl might go too.    \"What will you do there?\" asked Peter practically.    \"I shall learn how to tell stories to all the world,\" said the Story  Girl dreamily.    It was a lovely, golden-brown evening; the orchard, and the farm-lands  beyond, were full of ruby lights and kissing shadows. Over in the east,  above the Awkward Man's house, the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess  floated across the sky, presently turning as rosy as if bedewed with her  heart's blood. We sat there and talked until the first star lighted a  white taper over the beech hill.    Then I remembered that I had forgotten to take my dose of magic seed,  and I hastened to do it, although I was beginning to lose faith in it. I  had not grown a single bit, by the merciless testimony of the hall door.    I took the box of seed out of my trunk in the twilit room and swallowed  the decreed pinch. As I did so, Dan's voice rang out behind me.    \"Beverley King, what have you got there?\"    I thrust the box hastily into my trunk and confronted Dan.    \"None of your business,\" I said defiantly.    \"Yes, 'tis.\" Dan was too much in earnest to resent my blunt speech.  \"Look here, Bev, is that magic seed? And did you get it from Billy  Robinson?\"    Dan and I looked at each other, suspicion dawning in our eyes.    \"What do you know about Billy Robinson and his magic seed?\" I demanded.    \"Just this. I bought a box from him for--for--something. He said he  wasn't going to sell any of it to anybody else. Did he sell any to you?\"    \"Yes, he did,\" I said in disgust--for I was beginning to understand that  Billy and his magic seed were arrant frauds.    \"What for? YOUR mouth is a decent size,\" said Dan.    \"Mouth? It had nothing to do with my mouth! He said it would make me  grow tall. And it hasn't--not an inch! I don't see what you wanted it  for! You are tall enough.\"    \"I got it for my mouth,\" said Dan with a shame-faced grin. \"The girls in  school laugh at it so. Kate Marr says it's like a gash in a pie. Billy  said that seed would shrink it for sure.\"    Well, there it was! Billy had deceived us both. Nor were we the only  victims. We did not find the whole story out at once. Indeed, the summer  was almost over before, in one way or another, the full measure of that  shameless Billy Robinson's iniquity was revealed to us. But I shall  anticipate the successive relations in this chapter. Every pupil of  Carlisle school, so it eventually appeared, had bought magic seed, under  solemn promise of secrecy. Felix had believed blissfully that it would  make him thin. Cecily's hair was to become naturally curly, and Sara Ray  was not to be afraid of Peg Bowen any more. It was to make Felicity as  clever as the Story Girl and it was to make the Story Girl as good a  cook as Felicity. What Peter had bought magic seed for remained a secret  longer than any of the others. Finally--it was the night before what we  expected would be the Judgment Day--he confessed to me that he had taken  it to make Felicity fond of him. Skilfully indeed had that astute Billy  played on our respective weaknesses.    The keenest edge to our humiliation was given by the discovery that  the magic seed was nothing more or less than caraway, which grew in  abundance at Billy Robinson's uncle's in Markdale. Peg Bowen had had  nothing to do with it.    Well, we had all been badly hoaxed. But we did not trumpet our wrongs  abroad. We did not even call Billy to account. We thought that least  said was soonest mended in such a matter. We went very softly indeed,  lest the grown-ups, especially that terrible Uncle Roger, should hear of  it.    \"We should have known better than to trust Billy Robinson,\" said  Felicity, summing up the case one evening when all had been made known.  \"After all, what could you expect from a pig but a grunt?\"    We were not surprised to find that Billy Robinson's contribution to the  library fund was the largest handed in by any of the scholars. Cecily  said she didn't envy him his conscience. But I am afraid she measured  his conscience by her own. I doubt very much if Billy's troubled him at  all.        CHAPTER X. A DAUGHTER OF EVE    \"I hate the thought of growing up,\" said the Story Girl reflectively,  \"because I can never go barefooted then, and nobody will ever see what  beautiful feet I have.\"    She was sitting, the July sunlight, on the ledge of the open hayloft  window in Uncle Roger's big barn; and the bare feet below her print  skirt WERE beautiful. They were slender and shapely and satin smooth  with arched insteps, the daintiest of toes, and nails like pink shells.    We were all in the hayloft. The Story Girl had been telling us a tale        \"Of old, unhappy, far-off things,      And battles long ago.\"    Felicity and Cecily were curled up in a corner, and we boys sprawled  idly on the fragrant, sun-warm heaps. We had \"stowed\" the hay in the  loft that morning for Uncle Roger, so we felt that we had earned the  right to loll on our sweet-smelling couch. Haylofts are delicious  places, with just enough of shadow and soft, uncertain noises to give  an agreeable tang of mystery. The swallows flew in and out of their nest  above our heads, and whenever a sunbeam fell through a chink the air  swarmed with golden dust. Outside of the loft was a vast, sunshiny gulf  of blue sky and mellow air, wherein floated argosies of fluffy cloud,  and airy tops of maple and spruce.    Pat was with us, of course, prowling about stealthily, or making  frantic, bootless leaps at the swallows. A cat in a hayloft is a  beautiful example of the eternal fitness of things."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#14)"],[1,"the vegetables, and with them he sent his only son, saying \"If  the lad is lazy and falls behind, shove him along and make him work.\"    So they all went into the garden and began cutting the weeds with  their knives; and presently the boy fell into the rear. On which they  said \"There is that Brahmin boy fallen behind. Did not his father  say that we were to push him along? What is to be done now? But the  elder brother said, \"Do? Why, do as we were told.\" On which each of  them hit him with his weeding knife, so that presently he died. And  when the weeding was quite finished, they went and told the Brahmin,  saying \"You told us to shove him along, and as we had our knives in our  hands, we hurt him so that he died.\" But the Brahmin was speechless,  for they had but done as they were told.    Another day he told them to go and plough. \"Take your ploughs up above  the great simul tree,\" he said. So they rose in the early morning, and,  taking ploughs, cattle and ropes, went to the great simul tree. And  some stayed below and bound the ploughs and cattle with the ropes,  and others climbed the tree and hauled. But the ropes broke and the  cattle were killed and the ploughs were smashed. And then they went  and told the Brahmin that they had tried to plough above the simul  tree and had failed. \"And what of the cattle?\" said he, \"Oh! they  fell down and were killed,\" they replied. So, in despair, he bought  other cattle and sent them out to plough afresh.    And when the harvest was ripe, they reaped the paddy, and, tying it in  sheaves, brought it home and asked where they were to put it. And the  Brahmin said \"Put it where my old woman tells you to put it.\" So they  went and asked the Brahmin's wife. But she was very busy, and only  cried \"Oh, bother you and your paddy! Put it on my head!\" On this,  they all took their sheaves, and heaped them on the old woman, so that  she died. And when the Brahmin came from his work and asked for his  old woman, they said they had buried her in the paddy, as she told  them to. On which, being at his wit's end, he bade them go and bury  her. On this, they tied the corpse on a bamboo sledge and bumped it  along through the bamboo-clump, so that it got knocked off by the way.    And when they came to some fallow land, they dug a grave, and then  began looking about for the corpse. Now there was an old woman hard  by herding cattle. \"Cunning old wretch!\" said they, \"she is afraid  of being buried, and is pretending to be somebody else.\" So they got  hold of her, and, in spite of her struggles, buried her.    And the Brahmin, in fear of what they might do next, began to contrive  means to get rid of them. So he said \"Today, my sons, we will go and  cut down the great simul tree.\" So they took their axes and, going  to the simul tree, began hewing with a will, and when the tree was  tottering to its fall, the Brahmin said to them \"If the tree falls  down, it will be broken. Run under it and catch it!\" And when they  did so, the Brahmin gave the last strokes, and the tree fell on the  seven simpletons and killed them. And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE BLIND MAN AND THE HUNCHBACK.    There sprang up a friendship between a blind man and a hunchback. And  one day they said to one another \"We shall get more if we beg in  some other village than our own.\" The hunchback made the blind man  hold his stick, and so dragged him along. And as they went, the  blind man trod upon an old elephant rope which lay upon the road,  and said to his friend \"Ah! friend, what is this thing like a long  snake which I am treading upon?\" The hunchback said \"Why, it is only  an old elephant-rope.\" But the blind man said \"Take it, my friend,  take it.\" But, as the hunchback refused, the blind man bid his friend  hand it to him, and so they went their ways thence.    And presently they came to a river; and as they were wading across  it, the blind man trod upon a tortoise and told his friend that he  had trod upon something living; but the hunchback said it was only a  stone, and asked what was the use of standing there talking. But the  blind man begged him to feel and see. And when the hunchback announced  that it was a tortoise, the blind man begged his friend to take that,  too; and on the hunchback declaring that it was too heavy, he finally  carried it himself.    Then they went their ways and came to a meadow, and heard a drum  being beaten. And the blind man asked what that was, and where the  drumming was going on. On which the hunchback said it was only cowherds  drumming. On which the blind man was for sending the hunchback to  fetch the drum.    But the hunchback said \"How shall I fetch it? They will be too strong  for me, for they are many.\" Then the blind man devised a plan, and bade  the hunchback crawl through the jungle and roar like a tiger. Which  the hunchback did; and the cowherd boys, on hearing his roaring, ran  away headlong and left the drum, which the hunchback gave, as before,  to the blind man to carry.    Then the friends went through the forest, until they came to some  houses. On which the hunchback said \"My friend, the sun has set,  and evening has come. How much further are we to go? Here are houses,  let's stop here.\" But the blind man said he did not think very well of  houses in the jungle, and sent his friend to have a good look at them.    Presently the hunchback returned and said \"There are two or three  houses and a granary.\" On this, the blind man decided that they would  stay in the granary, and so was dragged into the granary, where they  carefully fastened the doors and prepared to stay for the night. And  while they were there, Rakshashas came and said--                  \"Fine rice, fine rice, I can smell;              \"And better things to eat as well.\"      And while they were gliding round the house, the blind man shouted  loudly \"Here am I!\" \"Who are you?\" said the Rakshashas. \"Who are  you?\" shouted the blind man. \"I am a Rakshasha,\" said one of them. \"And  I am a Zakshasha!\" [28] said the blind man. Whereupon they all got  very angry. Then the blind man said \"You need not get angry and  you need not get noisy. I can't see you and you can't see me. Let  us make an expedient by which you can be satisfied.\" So saying,  the blind man bade the Rakshasha show him a lock of his hair. On  this a Rakshasha tore out a bunch of hair and showed it to him. On  which the blind man said \"Now see mine!\" And so saying, thrust out  of a chink the elephant rope. And on seeing it, the Rakshasha became  very afraid. Then the blind man demanded to see a flea (from his  body). And when the Rakshasha had shown him one, the blind man put  forth his tortoise. Then the Rakshasha thought \"This must indeed be  a Zakshasha,\" and was greatly afraid. Then the blind man bade him  beat his breast. And, on his doing so, cried \"Well done, well done! I  have heard you. Now hear me!\" and straightway began to beat his drum  \"rub-a-dub-dub.\" On which the Rakshashas were greatly frightened and  ran right away.    Then the blind man said to his friend \"Take any good things that there  are, and tie them up. You take some and give me some, and let us go;\"  and, so saying, they went away together. And when they were come to  a far place, the hunchback began dividing the spoil. And, when that  was done, he bade his friend take which share he would. But the blind  man groped about and found that the share nearest to the hunchback  was the biggest. So the hunchback said \"How did you, without seeing,  find that out? Now I have got to divide it all over again!\" So he  made a fresh division.    And the same thing happened again, and the blind man turned everything  topsy-turvy. And, when this had occurred four or five times, the  hunchback became angry, and taking sand in his hand rubbed it into the  blind man's eyes, saying \"Now we shall see if you are really blind or  not;\" whereby the blind man recovered his sight. But he, too, was angry  and said \"What a hideous thing you are, and hateful to look upon.\" And  he jumped on the hunchback's back and belaboured his hump till he  made him straight and well. And when the two were hale and well,  they divided their spoil fairly and went home happily. And that's all!            THE STORY OF A SILLY OLD MAN.    There was an old man and his wife. One day, when the old man was  clearing jungle, a half-dead deer that had been shot by a huntsman,  came limping that way and crossed the old man's field. On which the  old man killed it by hitting it on the head with his hoe, and hid  it away in the jungle. Presently, the man who shot the deer made  his appearance, having tracked its blood as far as the old man's  field. \"Here, old man!\" said he, \"have you seen a wounded deer pass  this way?\" The old man replied \"The boundaries of my field? Well,  the east boundary is here and the west over there!\" But the other  said \"Not so, not so, I am asking about a wounded deer.\" To which  the old man replied \"I know what you mean; but whether it will be a  good crop or not, how shall I say?\" \"Not so, not so,\" said the other;  that isn't what I want to know.\" But the old man said \"I cannot stop  any longer. The dark is falling, and I am hungry for my supper. I'm  off.\" So saying, he went away home, and when he had had his supper, he  said to his old woman \"You must give me my breakfast early tomorrow,  for I have killed a deer, and I must go early and cut it up.\" So  the old woman gave him his breakfast very early and sent him about  his business. And he went to his field, and, having chopped up the  carcase began dividing the pieces. And first he put apart his own  share, \"One piece for washing my face in the morning; one piece for  chewing tobacco; one piece for driving the cattle afield; one piece  for ploughing\"; and so on, for all his daily avocations. Then he  made out his old woman's share: \"One piece for washing her face in  the morning; one piece for chewing "]]]
