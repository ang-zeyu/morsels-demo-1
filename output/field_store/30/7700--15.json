The White Hussars shouted, and threw everything movable about them into  the air, and when the parade was over, they cheered the Colonel till they  couldn't speak. No cheers were put up for Lieutenant Hogan-Yale, who  smiled very sweetly in the background.    Said the Second-in-Command to the Colonel, unofficially--    \"These little things ensure popularity, and do not the least affect  discipline.\"    \"But I went back on my word,\" said the Colonel.    \"Never mind,\" said the Second-in-Command. \"The White Hussars will follow  you anywhere from to-day. Regiments are just like women. They will do  anything for trinketry.\"    A week later, Hogan-Yale received an extraordinary letter from some one  who signed himself \"Secretary, _Charity and Zeal,_ 3709, E. C.,\" and asked  for \"the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your  possession.\"    \"Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones?\" said Hogan-Yale.    \"Beg your pardon, Sir,\" said the Band-Sergeant, \"but the skeleton is with  me, an' I'll return it if you'll pay the carriage into the Civil Lines.  There's a coffin with it, Sir.\"    Hogan-Yale smiled and handed two rupees to the Band-Sergeant, saying,  \"Write the date on the skull, will you?\"    If you doubt this story, and know where to go, you can see the date on the  skeleton. But don't mention the matter to the White Hussars.    I happened to know something about it, because I prepared the Drum-Horse  for his resurrection. He did not take kindly to the skeleton at all.        AT TWENTY-TWO    Narrow as the womb, deep as the Pit, and dark as the heart of a  man.--_Sonthal Miner's Proverb_.    \"A weaver went out to reap but stayed to unravel the corn-stalks. Ha! Ha!  Ha! Is there any sense in a weaver?\"    Janki Meah glared at Kundoo, but, as Janki Meah was blind, Kundoo was not  impressed. He had come to argue with Janki Meah, and, if chance favored,  to make love to the old man's pretty young wife.    This was Kundoo's grievance, and he spoke in the name of all the five men  who, with Janki Meah, composed the gang in Number Seven gallery of  Twenty-Two. Janki Meah had been blind for the thirty years during which he  had served the Jimahari Collieries with pick and crowbar. All through  those thirty years he had regularly, every morning before going down,  drawn from the overseer his allowance of lamp-oil--just as if he had been  an eyed miner. What Kundoo's gang resented, as hundreds of gangs had  resented before, was Janki Meah's selfishness. He would not add the oil to  the common stock of his gang, but would save and sell it.    \"I knew these workings before you were born,\" Janki Meah used to reply; \"I  don't want the light to get my coal out by, and I am not going to help  you. The oil is mine, and I intend to keep it.\"    A strange man in many ways was Janki Meah, the white-haired, hot tempered,  sightless weaver who had turned pitman. All day long--except on Sundays  and Mondays when he was usually drunk--he worked in the Twenty-Two shaft  of the Jimahari Colliery as cleverly as a man with all the senses. At  evening he went up in the great steam-hauled cage to the pit-bank, and  there called for his pony--a rusty, coal-dusty beast, nearly as old as  Janki Meah. The pony would come to his side, and Janki Meah would clamber  on to its back and be taken at once to the plot of land which he, like the  other miners, received from the Jimahari Company. The pony knew that  place, and when, after six years, the Company changed all the allotments  to prevent the miners from acquiring proprietary rights, Janki Meah  represented, with tears in his eyes, that were his holdings shifted, he  would never be able to find his way to the new one. \"My horse only knows  that place,\" pleaded Janki Meah, and so he was allowed to keep his land.    On the strength of this concession and his accumulated oil-savings, Janki  Meah took a second wife--a girl of the Jolaha main stock of the Meahs, and  singularly beautiful. Janki Meah could not see her beauty; wherefore he  took her on trust, and forbade her to go down the pit. He had not worked  for thirty years in the dark without knowing that the pit was no place for  pretty women. He loaded her with ornaments--not brass or pewter, but real  silver ones--and she rewarded him by flirting outrageously with Kundoo of  Number Seven gallery gang. Kundoo was really the gang-head, but Janki Meah  insisted upon all the work being entered in his own name, and chose the  men that he worked with. Custom--stronger even than the Jimahari  Company--dictated that Janki, by right of his years, should manage these  things, and should, also, work despite his blindness. In Indian mines  where they cut into the solid coal with the pick and clear it out from  floor to ceiling, he could come to no great harm. At Home, where they  undercut the coal and bring it down in crashing avalanches from the roof,  he would never have been allowed to set foot in a pit. He was not a  popular man, because of his oil-savings; but all the gangs admitted that  Janki knew all the _khads,_ or workings, that had ever been sunk or worked  since the Jimahari Company first started operations on the Tarachunda  fields.    Pretty little Unda only knew that her old husband was a fool who could be  managed. She took no interest in the collieries except in so far as they  swallowed up Kundoo five days out of the seven, and covered him with  coal-dust. Kundoo was a great workman, and did his best not to get drunk,  because, when he had saved forty rupees, Unda was to steal everything that  she could find in Janki's house and run with Kundoo to a land where there  were no mines, and every one kept three fat bullocks and a milch-buffalo.  While this scheme ripened it was his custom to drop in upon Janki and  worry him about the oil savings. Unda sat in a corner and nodded approval.  On the night when Kundoo had quoted that objectionable proverb about  weavers, Janki grew angry.    \"Listen, you pig,\" said he, \"blind I am, and old I am, but, before ever  you were born, I was grey among the coal. Even in the days when the  Twenty-Two _khad_ was unsunk and there were not two thousand men here, I  was known to have all knowledge of the pits. What _khad_ is there that I  do not know, from the bottom of the shaft to the end of the last drive? Is  it the Baromba _khad_, the oldest, or the Twenty-Two where Tibu's gallery  runs up to Number Five?\"    \"Hear the old fool talk!\" said Kundoo, nodding to Unda. \"No gallery of  Twenty-Two will cut into Five before the end of the Rains. We have a  month's solid coal before us. The Babuji says so.\"    \"Babuji! Pigji! Dogji! What do these fat slugs from Calcutta know? He  draws and draws and draws, and talks and talks and talks, and his maps are  all wrong. I, Janki, know that this is so. When a man has been shut up in  the dark for thirty years, God gives him knowledge. The old gallery that  Tibu's gang made is not six feet from Number Five.\"    \"Without doubt God gives the blind knowledge,\" said Kundoo, with a look at  Unda. \"Let it be as you say. I, for my part, do not know where lies the  gallery of Tibu's gang, but _I_ am not a withered monkey who needs oil to  grease his joints with.\"    Kundoo swung out of the hut laughing, and Unda giggled. Janki turned his  sightless eyes toward his wife and swore. \"I have land, and I have sold a  great deal of lamp-oil,\" mused Janki; \"but I was a fool to marry this  child.\"    A week later the Rains set in with a vengeance, and the gangs paddled  about in coal-slush at the pit-banks. Then the big mine-pumps were made  ready, and the Manager of the Colliery ploughed through the wet toward the  Tarachunda River swelling between its soppy banks. \"Lord send that this  beastly beck doesn't misbehave,\" said the Manager, piously, and he went to  take counsel with his Assistant about the pumps.    But the Tarachunda misbehaved very much indeed. After a fall of three  inches of rain in an hour it was obliged to do something. It topped its  bank and joined the flood water that was hemmed between two low hills just  where the embankment of the Colliery main line crossed. When a large part  of a rain-fed river, and a few acres of flood-water, made a dead set for a  nine-foot culvert, the culvert may spout its finest, but the water cannot  _all_ get out. The Manager pranced upon one leg with excitement, and his  language was improper.    He had reason to swear, because he knew that one inch of water on land  meant a pressure of one hundred tons to the acre; and here were about five  feet of water forming, behind the railway embankment, over the shallower  workings of Twenty-Two. You must understand that, in a coal-mine, the coal  nearest the surface is worked first from the central shaft. That is to  say, the miners may clear out the stuff to within ten, twenty, or thirty  feet of the surface, and, when all is worked out, leave only a skin of  earth upheld by some few pillars of coal. In a deep mine where they know  that they have any amount of material at hand, men prefer to get all their  mineral out at one shaft, rather than make a number of little holes to tap  the comparatively unimportant surface-coal.    And the Manager watched the flood.    The culvert spouted a nine-foot gush; but the water still formed, and word  was sent to clear the men out of Twenty-Two. The cages came up crammed and  crammed again with the men nearest the pit-eye, as they call the place  where you can see daylight from the bottom of the main shaft. All away and  away up the long black galleries the flare-lamps were winking and dancing  like so many fireflies, and the men and the women waited for the clanking,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#14)"],[1," convinced that the only portions of Puritan female anatomy that were  clothed with anything approaching respectable regard for health in the  inclement New England climate were the head and the hands. The hands of  \"New English dames\" were carefully protected with embroidered kid or  leather gloves (for the early New Englanders were great glove wearers) or  with warm knit woollen mittens, though mittens for women's wear were  always fingerless. The well-gloved hands were moreover warmly ensconced in  enormous stuffed muffs of bearskin which were almost as large as a  flour barrel, or in smaller muffs of rabbit-skin or mink or beaver. The  goodwives' heads bore, besides the close caps so universally worn, mufflers  and veils and hoods,--hoods of all kinds and descriptions, from the hoods  of serge and camlet and gauze and black silk that Mistress Estabrook, wife  of the Windham parson, proudly owned and wore, from the prohibited \"silk  and tiffany hoods\" of the earliest planters down through the centuries'  inflorescence of \"hoods of crimson colored persian,\" \"wild bore and hum-hum  long hoods,\" \"pointed velvet capuchins,\" \"scarlet gipsys,\" \"pinnered  and tasselled hoods,\" \"shirred lustring hoods,\" \"hoods of rich pptuna,\"  \"muskmelon hoods,\" to the warm quilted \"punkin hoods\" worn within this  century in country churches. These \"punkin-hoods\" were quilted with great  rolls of woollen wadding and drawn tight between the rolls with strong  cords. They formed a deafening and heating head-covering which always had  to be loosened and thrust back when the wearer was within doors. It  was only equalled in shapeless clumsiness and unique ugliness by its  summer-sister of the same date, the green silk calash,--that funniest and  quaintest of all New England feminine headgear,--a great sunshade that  could not be called a bonnet, always made of bright green silk shirred on  strong lengths of rattan or whalebone, and extendible after the fashion of  a chaise top. It could be drawn out over the face by a little green ribbon  or \"bridle\" that was fastened to the extreme front at the top; or it could  be pushed in a close-gathered mass on the back of the head These calashes  were frequently a foot and a half in diameter, and thus stood well up from  the head and did not disarrange the hair nor crush the headdress or cap.  They formed a perfect and easily-adjusted shade from the sun. Masks, too,  the fair Puritans wore to further protect their heads and faces,--masks of  green silk or black vehet, with silver mouthpieces to place within the lips  and thus enable the wearer to keep the mask firmly in place. Sometimes two  little strings with a silver bead at one end were fastened to the mask, and  seined as mouthpieces. With a string and bead at either corner of the  mouth the mask-wearer could talk quite freely while still retaining her  face-covering in its protecting position. These masks were never worn  within doors. In the list of goods ordered by George Washington from Europe  for his fair bride Martha were several of these riding-masks, and the kind  step-father even ordered a supply of small masks for \"Miss Custis,\" his  little step-daughter.    In bitter winter weather women carried to meeting little  foot-stoves,--metal boxes which stood on legs and were filled with hot  coals at home, and a second time during the morning from the hearthstone of  a neighboring farm-house or a noon-house. These foot-warmers helped to make  endurable to the goodwives the icy chill of the meeting-house; and round  their mother's foot-stove the shivering little children sat on their low  crickets, warming their half-frozen fingers.    Some of these foot-stoves were really pretentious church-furnishings. I  have seen one \"brassen foot-stove\" which had the owner's cipher cut out of  the sheet metal, and from the side was hung a wrought brass chain. By this  chain, a century ago, the shining polished brass stove was carried into  church in the hands of a liveried black man, who held it ostentatiously at  arms' length, that neither ash nor scorch might touch his scarlet velvet  breeches. And after he had tucked it under my lady's tiny feet as she sat  in her pew, he retired to his freezing loft high up among the beams,--the  \"Nigger Pew,\"--where, I am sorry to record, he more than once solaced and  warmed himself with a bottle of \"kill-devil\" which he had smuggled into  church, until he fell ignominiously asleep and his drunken snores so  disturbed the minister and the congregation, that two tithingmen were  forced to climb the ladder-like staircase and pull him down and out of  the church and to the neighboring tavern to sleep off the effects of the  liquor. For being \"a man and a brother\" and, above all, in spite of his  petty idiosyncrasies, a very good and cherished servant, he could not be  thrust out into the snow to freeze to death.    But with the extreme Puritan contempt of comfort even foot-stoves were  not always allowed. The First Church of Roxbury, after having one church  edifice destroyed by fire in 1747, prohibited the use of footstoves in  meeting, and the Roxbury matrons sat with frozen toes in their fine new  meeting-house. The Old South Church of Boston was not so rigid, though it  felt the same dread of fire; for we find this entry on the records of the  church under the date of January 10, 1771: \"Whereas, danger is apprehended  from the [foot] stoves that arc frequently left in the meeting-house after  the publick worship is over; Voted, that the Saxton make diligent search on  the Lord's Day evening and in the evening after a lecture, to see if any  stoves are left in the house, and that if he find any there he take them  to his own house; and it is expected that the owners of such stoves make  reasonable satisfaction to the Saxton for his trouble before they take them  away.\"    In Hardwicke, in 1792, it was ordered that \"no stows be carried into our  new meeting-house with fire in them.\" The Hardwicke women may have found  comfort in a contrivance which is thus described in by an \"old inhabitant:\"          \"There to warm their feet    Was seen an article now obsolete,    A sort of basket tub of braided straw    Or husks, in which is placed a heated stone,    Which does half-frozen limbs superbly thaw.    And warms the marrow of the oldest bone.\"    In some of the early, poorly built log meeting-houses, fur bags made of  coarse skins, such as wolf-skin, were nailed or tied to the edges of the  benches, and into these bags the worshippers thrust their feet for warmth.  In some communities it was the custom for each family to bring on cold days  its \"dogg\" to meeting; where, lying at or on his master's feet, he proved  a source of grateful warmth. These animal stoves became such an abounding  nuisance, however, that dog-whippers had to be appointed to serve on  Sundays to drive out the dogs. All through the records of the early  churches we find such entries as this: \"Whatsoever doggs come into the  meeting-house in time of public worship, their owners shall each pay  sixpence.\" Sixpence seems little, but the thrifty and poor Puritans would  rather freeze their toes than pay sixpence for their calorific dogs.    The church members made many rules and regulations to keep the cold out of  the meeting-house during service-time, or perhaps we should say to keep the  wind out. Thus in Woodstock, Connecticut, in 1725 it was ordered that the  \"several doors of the meeting-house be taken care of and kept shut in very  cold and windy seasons according to the lying of the wind from time to  time; and that people in such windy weather come in at the leeward doors  only, and take care that they are easily shut both to prevent the breaking  of the doors and the making of a noise.\" In other churches it was ordered  that \"no doors be opened to the windward and only one door to the leeward\"  during winter weather.    The first church of Salem built a \"cattied chimney twelve feet long\" in its  meeting-house in 1662, but five years later it was removed, perhaps through  the colonists' dread lest the building be destroyed by a conflagration  caused by the combustible nature of the materials of which the chimney was  composed. Felt, in his \"Annals of Salem,\" asserts that the First Church of  Boston was the first New England congregation to have a stove for heating  the meeting-house at the time of public worship; this was in 1773. This  statement is incorrect. Mr. Judd says the Hadley church had an iron stove  in their meeting-house as early as 1734--the Hadley people were such  sybarites and novelty-lovers in those early days! The Old South Church of  Boston followed in the luxurious fashion in 1783, and the \"Evening Post\"  of January 25, 1783, contained a poem of which these four lines show the  criticising and deprecating spirit:--      \"Extinct the sacred fire of love,      Our zeal grown cold and dead,    In the house of God we fix a stove      To warm us in their stead.\"    Other New England congregations piously froze during service-time well into  this century. The Longmeadow church, early in the field, had a stove in  1810; the Salem people in 1815; and the Medford meeting in 1820. The church  in Brimfield in 1819 refused to pay for a stove, but ordered as some  sacrifice to the desire for comfort, two extra doors placed on the  gallery-stairs to keep out draughts; but when in that town, a few years  later, a subscription was made to buy a church stove, one old member  refused to contribute, saying \"good preaching kept him hot enough without  stoves.\"    As all the church edifices were built without any thought of the  possibility of such comfortable furniture, they had to be adapted as best  they might to the ungainly and unsightly great stoves which were usually  placed in the central aisle of the building. From these cast-iron monsters,  there extended to the nearest windows and projected through them, hideous  stove-pipes "]]]
