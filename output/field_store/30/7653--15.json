Coconuts are not very well adapted for natural dispersal on land, and  this would rather induce us to suppose an origin within the period of  cultivation for the whole group. There are a large number of cultivated  varieties of different species which by some peculiarity do not seem  adapted for the conditions of life in the wild state. These last have  often been used to prove the origin of varietal forms during culture.  One of the oldest instances is the variety or rather subspecies of the  opium-poppy, which lacks the ability to burst open its capsules. The  seeds, which are thrown out by the wind, in the common forms, through  the apertures underneath [90] the stigma, remain enclosed. This is  manifestly a very useful adaptation for a cultivated plant, as by this  means no seeds are lost. It would be quite a disadvantage for a wild  species, and is therefore claimed to have been connected from the  beginning with the cultivated form.    The large kernels of corn and grain, of beans and peas, and even of the  lupines were considered by Darwin and others to be unable to cope with  natural conditions of life. Many valuable fruits are quite sterile, or  produce extremely few seeds. This is notoriously the case with some of  the best pears and grapes, with the pine-apples, bananas, bread-fruits,  pomegranate and some members of the orange tribe. It is open to  discussion as to what may be the immediate cause of this sterility, but  it is quite evident, that all such sterile varieties must have  originated in a cultivated condition. Otherwise they would surely have  been lost.    In horticulture and agriculture the fact that new varieties arise from  time to time is beyond all doubt, and it is not this question with which  we are now concerned. Our arguments were only intended to prove that  cultivated species, as a rule, are derived from wild species, which obey  the laws discussed in a previous lecture. The botanic units are compound  entities, and [91] the real systematic units in elementary species play  the same part as in ordinary wild species. The inference that the origin  of the cultivated plants is multiple, in most cases, and that more than  one, often many separate elementary forms of the same species must  originally have been taken into cultivation, throws much light upon many  highly important problems of cultivation and selection. This aspect of  the question will therefore be the subject of the next lecture.      [92]    LECTURE IV    SELECTION OF ELEMENTARY SPECIES    The improvement of cultivated plants must obviously begin with already  existing forms. This is true of old cultivated sorts as well as for  recent introductions. In either case the starting-point is as important  as the improvement, or rather the results depend in a far higher degree  on the adequate choice of the initial material than on the methodical  and careful treatment of the chosen varieties. This however, has not  always been appreciated as it deserves, nor is its importance at present  universally recognized. The method of selecting plants for the  improvement of the race was discovered by Louis Vilmorin about the  middle of the last century. Before his time selection was applied to  domestic animals, but Vilmorin was the first to apply this principle to  plants. As is well known, he used this method to increase the amount of  sugar in beets and thus to raise their value as forage-crops, with such  success, that his plants have since been used for the production [93] of  sugar. He must have made some choice among the numerous available sorts  of beets, or chance must have placed in his hands one of the most  appropriate forms. On this point however, no evidence is at hand.    Since the work of Vilmorin the selection-principle has increased  enormously in importance, for practical purposes as well as for the  theoretical aspect of the subject. It is now being applied on a large  scale to nearly all ornamental plants. It is the one great principle now  in universal practice as well as one of preeminent scientific value. Of  course, the main arguments of the evolution theory rest upon  morphologic, systematic, geographic and paleontologic evidence. But the  question as to how we can coordinate the relation between existing  species and their supposed ancestors is of course one of a physiologic  nature. Direct observation or experiments were not available for Darwin  and so he found himself constrained to make use of the experience of  breeders. This he did on a broad scale, and with such success that it  was precisely this side of his arguments that played the major part in  convincing his contemporaries.    The work of the breeders previous to Darwin's time had not been very  critically performed. Recent analyses of the evidence obtained [94] from  them show that numerous types of variability were usually thrown  together. What type in each case afforded the material, which the  breeder in reality made use of, has only been inquired into in the last  few decades. Among those who have opened the way for thorough and more  scientific treatment are to be mentioned Rimpau and Von Rumker of  Germany and W.M. Hays of America.    Von Rumker is to be considered as the first writer, who sharply  distinguished between two phases of methodical breeding-selection. One  side he calls the production of new forms, the other the improvement of  the breed. He dealt with both methods extensively. New forms are  considered as spontaneous variations occurring or originating without  human aid. They have only to be selected and isolated, and their progeny  at once yields a constant and pure race. This race retains its character  as long as it is protected against the admixture of other minor  varieties, either by cross-pollination, or by accidental seeds.    Improvement, on the other hand, is the work of man. New varieties of  course can only be isolated if chance offers them; the improvement is  not incumbent on chance. It does not create really anything new, but  develops characters, which were already existing. It brings [95] the  race above its average, and must guard constantly against the regression  towards this average which usually takes place.    Hays has repeatedly insisted upon the principle of the choice of the  most favorable varieties as the foundation for all experiments in  improving races. He asserts that half the battle is won by choosing the  variety which is to serve as a foundation stock, while the other half  depends upon the selection of parent-plants within the chosen variety.  Thus the choice of the variety is the first principle to be applied in  every single case; the so-called artificial selection takes only a  secondary place. Calling all minor units within the botanic species by  the common name of varieties, without regard to the distinction between  elementary species and retrograde varieties, the principle is designated  by the term of \"variety-testing.\" This testing of varieties is now, as  is universally known, one of the most important lines of work of the  agricultural experiment stations. Every state and every region, in some  instances even the larger farms, require a separate variety of corn, or  wheat, or other crops. They must be segregated from among the hundreds  of generally cultivated forms, within each single botanic species. Once  found, the type may be ameliorated according to the local conditions  [96] and needs, and this is a question of improvement.    The fact that our cultivated plants are commonly mixtures of different  sorts, has not always been known. The first to recognize it seems to  have been the Spanish professor of botany, Mariano Lagasca, who  published a number of Spanish papers dealing with useful plants and  botanical subjects between 1810 and 1830, among them a catalogue of  plants cultivated in the Madrid Botanical Garden. Once when he was on a  visit to Colonel Le Couteur on his farm in Jersey, one of the Channel  Islands off the coast of France, in discussing the value of the fields  of wheat, he pointed out to his host, that they were not really pure and  uniform, as was thought at that time, and suggested the idea that some  of the constituents might form a larger part in the harvest than others.  In a single field he succeeded in distinguishing no less than 23  varieties, all growing together. Colonel Le Couteur took the hint, and  saved the seeds of a single plant of each supposed variety separately.  These he cultivated and multiplied till he got large lots of each and  could compare their value. From among them he then chose the variety  producing the greatest amount of the finest, whitest and most nutritious  flour. This he eventually placed in the [97] market under the name of  \"Talavera de Bellevue.\" It is a tall, white variety, with long and  slender white heads, almost without awns, and with fine white pointed  kernels. It was introduced into commerce about 1830, and is still one of  the most generally cultivated French wheats. It was highly prized in the  magnificent collection of drawings and descriptions of wheats, published  by Vilmorin under the title \"Les meilleurs bles\" and is said to have  quite a number of valuable qualities, branching freely and producing an  abundance of good grain and straw. It is however, sensitive to cold  winters in some degree and thereby limited in its distribution. Hallett,  the celebrated English wheat-breeder, tried in vain to improve the  peculiar qualities of this valuable production of Le Couteur's.    Le Couteur worked during many years along this line, long before the  time when Vilmorin conceived the idea of improvement by race selections,  and he used only the simple principle of distinguishing and isolating  the members of his different fields. Later he published his results in a  work on the varieties, peculiarities and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#14)"],[1,"I thought it existed because of  the success which the Germans had had in all fields of endeavour,  particularly in manufacturing and commerce. He said, with great  truth, that he believed a great deal of it came from the bad  manners of the travelling Germans. Prince Henry is an able and  reasonable man with a most delightful manner. He speaks English  with a perfect English accent, and I think would be far happier  as an English country gentleman than as the Grand Admiral of the  German Baltic Fleet. He has been devoted to automobiling and  has greatly encouraged that industry in Germany. The Automobile  Club of Berlin is his particular pet.    On returning to Kiel next day we spent several days longer there.  I lunched on board his battleship with Grand Admiral von Tirpitz,  sitting next to him at the table. He struck me then as an amiable  sea dog, combining much political and worldly wisdom with his  knowledge of the sea. From Kiel we motored one night to dine  with a Count and Countess in their country house. This house  had been built perhaps two hundred years, and was on one side of  a square, the other three sides being formed by the great stone  barns in which the produce of the estate was stored. Although  the first floor of the house was elevated about eight feet above  the ground, the family, on account of the dampness of that part  of the world, lived in the second story, and the dining room  was on this story. An ancestor of the Count had, at a time when  this part of the country was part of Denmark and about the year  1700, lent all his available money to the King of Denmark. A  crude painting in the hall showed him sitting in the hall of  this particular house, smoking a long pipe and surrounded by  three or four sisters who were all spinning. Our hostess told us  that this picture represented the lending ancestor being supported  by his sisters while waiting the return of the loan which he  had made to the Danish king, an early example of the situation  disclosed by the popular song which runs: \"Everybody works but  father.\" Of course, no one ever expected a Prussian nobleman to  do any work except in the line of war or in governing the inferior  classes of the country.          CHAPTER VII    THE SYSTEM    People of other countries have been wondering why it is that  the German government is able so easily to impose its will upon  the German people. I have set out in another chapter, in detail,  the political system from which you have seen that the Reichstag  is nothing but a debating society; that the Prussians do not  really have universal suffrage but, by reason of the vicious  circle system of voting, the elective franchise remains in the  hands of the few; and that the government of the country through the  _Landräte_, _Regierungspräsidenten_ and _Oberpräsidenten_  is a central system from above downwards and not the election  of the rulers by the people; and, in the chapter on militarism  and Zabern, I have told by what means the control of the army  is kept in the hands of the class of nobles.    These are not the only means by which the system controls the  country. These alone would not suffice. From the time when he  is four years old, the German is disciplined and taught that  his government is the only good and effective form. The teachers  in the schools are all government paid and teach the children  only the principles desired by the rulers of the German people.  There are no Saturday holidays in the German schools and their  summer holidays are for only three to five weeks. You never see  gangs of small boys in Germany. Their games and their walks are  superintended by their teachers who are always inculcating in  them reverence and awe for the military heroes of the past and  present. On Saturday night the German boy is turned over by the  State paid school teacher to the State paid pastor who adds divine  authority to the principles of reverence for the German system.    There is a real system of caste in Germany. For instance, I was  playing tennis one day with a man and, while dressing afterwards,  I asked him what he was. He answered that he was a _Kaufmann_,  or merchant. For the German this answer was enough. It placed him  in the merchant class. I asked him what sort of a _Kaufmann_  he was. He then told me he was president of a large electrical  company. Of course, with us he would have answered first that  he was president of the electrical company, but being a German  he simply disclosed his caste without going into details. It is  a curious thing on the registers of guests in a German summer  resort to see Mrs. Manufactory-Proprietor Schultze registered  with Mrs. Landrat Schwartz and Mrs. Second Lieutenant von Bing.  Of course, there is no doubt as to the relative social positions  of Mrs. Manufactory-Proprietor Schultze and Mrs. Second Lieutenant  von Bing. Mrs. Manufactory-Proprietor Schultze may have a steam  yacht and a tiara, an opera box and ten million marks. She may  be an old lady noted for her works of charity. Her husband may  have made discoveries of enormous value to the human race, but  she will always be compelled to take her place behind Mrs. Second  Lieutenant von Bing, even if the latter is only seventeen years  old.    Of course, occasionally, officers of the army and navy condescend  to marry into the merchant caste, and if a girl has a choice  of three equally attractive young men, one a doctor, earning  ten thousand dollars a year; one a manufacturer, earning the  same amount; and one an army officer with a \"von\" before his  name and three thousand dollars a year, there is no hesitation  on her part: she takes the noble and the army officer.    For years all the highest official positions of the government  have been held by members of the Prussian noble class, and when  Zimmermann, of a substantial family in East Prussia, but not of  noble birth, was made Foreign Minister, the most intense surprise  was exhibited all over Germany at this innovation.    One of the most successful ways of disciplining the people is  by the _Rat_ system. _Rat_ means councillor, and is  a title of honour given to any one who has attained a certain  measure of success or standing in his chosen business or profession.  For instance, a business man is made a commerce _Rat_; a  lawyer, a justice _Rat_; a doctor, a sanitary _Rat_;  an architect or builder, a building _Rat_; a keeper of the  archives, an archive _Rat_; and so on. They are created in  this way: first, a man becomes a plain _Rat_, then, later on,  he becomes a secret _Rat_ or privy councillor; still later,  a court secret _Rat_ and, later still, a _wirklicher_,  or really and truly secret court _Rat_ to which may be added  the title of Excellency, which puts the man who has attained  this absolutely at the head of the _Rat_ ladder.    But see the insidious working of the system. By German custom  the woman always carries the husband's title. The wife of a  successful builder is known as Mrs. Really Truly Secret Court  Building _Rat_ and her social precedence over the other women  depends entirely upon her husband's position in the _Rat_  class. Titles of nobility alone do not count when they come in  contact with a high government position. Now if a lawyer gets to  be about forty years old and is not some sort of a _Rat_,  his wife begins to nag him and his friends and relations look at  him with suspicion. There must be something in his life which  prevents his obtaining the coveted distinction and if there is  anything in a man's past, if he has shown at any time any spirit of  opposition to the government, as disclosed by the police registers,  which are kept written up to date about every German citizen,  then he has no chance of obtaining any of these distinctions  which make up so much of the social life of Germany. It is a  means by which the government keeps a far tighter hold on the  intellectual part of its population than if they were threatened  with torture and the stake. The Social Democrats, who, of course,  have declared themselves against the existing system of government  and in favour of a republic, can receive no distinctions from  the government because they dared to lift their voices and their  pens in criticism of the existing order. For them there is the  fear of the law. Convictions for the crime of _Lèse-Majesté_  are of almost daily occurrence and, at the opening of the war, an  amnesty was granted in many of these cases, the ministry of war  withdrawing many prosecutions against poor devils waiting their  trial in jail because they had dared to speak disrespectfully of  the army. The following quotation from a German book, written  since the war, shows very clearly that this state of affairs  existed: \"In the beneficent atmosphere of general amnesty came the  news that the Minister of War had withdrawn pending prosecutions  against newspapers on account of their insults to the army or  its members.\" (Dr. J. Jastrow, \"Im Kriegszustand.\")    Besides the _Rat_ system and the military system, there  exists the enormous mass of Prussian officials. In a country  where so many things are under government control these officials  are almost immeasurably more numerous than in other countries.  In Prussia, for example, all the railways are government-owned,  with the exception of one road about sixty miles long and a few  small branch roads. This army of officials are retainers of the  government, and not only, of course, themselves refrain from  criticising the system, but also use their influence upon the  members of their own family and all with whom they come in contact.  They are subject to trial in special secret courts and one of  them who dared in any way to criticise the existing system would  not for long remain a member of it. Of course, the members of the  Reichstag have the privilege of free speech without responsibility,  and there are occasional Socialists, who"]]]
