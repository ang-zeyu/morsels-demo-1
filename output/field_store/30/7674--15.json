[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#14)"],[1," had just struck her was that she had a sudden fancy  to go and spend two days there, and I was to go with her.    I was ready to go to Africa with her if my leave permitted, and it so  happened that I was due for four days' overseas leave (limited to  Belgian territory) so that this fitted in very well, and I told her so.    She was delighted, then, with one of those quick intuitions which women  are so clever at, she read the half-formed thought in my mind, and  said: \"You mustn't think it's not going to be conventional; old Babette  will be with us to chaperon me.\" Old Babette is an aged female whom she  calls her maid. I think she is jealous of me.    I agreed at once that of course I quite understood it was to be highly  conventional, etc., though I smiled to myself as I visualized my  mother's shocked face and uplifted hands had she heard my Zoe's ideas  on the conventions.    I was trying to fathom what was at the bottom of it all when she  remarked: \"Of course, as my prisoner you will have to obey all my  orders.\"    I replied that this was certainly so.    \"And one of the first things,\" she continued, \"that happens to a  prisoner when he goes through the enemy lines is that he is  blindfolded, and in the same way I shan't let you know where you are  going.\"    Seeing a doubtful look in my eyes as I endeavoured to keep pace with  the underlying idea, if any, of this truly feminine fancy, she suddenly  came up to me and, lifting her eyes to mine, murmured: \"Don't you trust  me?\"    In a moment my passion flared up, and rained hot kisses on her face as  she struggled to release herself from my arms.    When I left that night after dinner, and, walking on air, returned to  the Mess, it was arranged that I should be at her flat with my  suit-case at 6 p.m. the next evening, prepared, to use her own words,  \"to disappear with me for 48 hours.\"    She had told me of an address in Bruges which she said would forward on  any telegram if I was recalled, and I had to be satisfied with that,  for I may as well say here that I never discovered where I went to, and  I don't know to this moment in what part of Belgium I spent the last  two nights.    I tried to find out at first, but as she obviously attached some  importance to keeping the locality of her woodland retreat a secret,  probably to circumvent the Colonel, I soon gave up trying to get the  secret from her, and contented myself with taking things as they came.    To go on with my account of what happened--which was really so  remarkable that I propose writing it out in detail to the best of my  memory--at 6 p.m. next day I was naturally at her flat feeling very  much as if I was on the threshold of an adventure.    Zoe was excited and the flat was in a turmoil, as apparently she had  only just begun to pack her dressing-case.    Soon after six we went down and got into a large Mercedes car which I  had noticed standing outside when I arrived. We were soon on our way,  and left Bruges by the Eastern barrier; we showed our passes and  proceeded into the darkened country-side. We had been running for about  a mile when she remarked, \"Prisoners will now be blindfolded!\" and, to  my astonishment, slipped a little black silk bag over my head.    I was so startled I didn't know whether to be angry, or to laugh, or  what to do. Eventually I did nothing, and, entering into the spirit of  the game, declared that even a wretched prisoner had the right not to  be stifled, whereupon she lifted the lower portion of the bag and  uncovered my mouth. Shortly afterwards I was electrified to feel a pair  of soft lips meet mine, a sensation which was repeated at frequent  intervals, and, as I whispered in her ear, under these conditions I was  prepared to be taken prisoner into the jaws of hell.    This pleasant journey had lasted for about three-quarters of an hour  when my mask was removed and I was informed that I was \"inside the  enemy lines!\" Through the windows of the car I could dimly see that an  apparently endless mass of fir trees were rushing past on each side.  This state of affairs continued for a kilometre or so, when we branched  to the right and soon entered a large clearing in the forest, at one  side of which stood the house. Babette, Zoe and myself entered the  building, and the car disappeared, presumably back to Bruges.    The house, built of logs, was of two stories; on the ground floor were  two living rooms, and the domains of Babette, who amongst her other  accomplishments turned out to be not only a most capable valet, but a  first-class cook. On the second story there were two large rooms. The  whole house was furnished after the manner of a hunting lodge, with  stags' heads on the walls, and skins on the floors. In the drawing-room  there was a piano and a few etchings of the wild boar by Schaffein.    I dressed for dinner in my \"smoking,\" though under ordinary  circumstances I should have considered this rather formal, but I was  glad I did, for she appeared in full evening _tenue_. She wore a violet  gown, and across her forehead a black satin bandeau with a Z in  diamonds upon it. It must have cost two thousand marks, and I wondered  with a dull kind of jealousy whether the Colonel had given it to her.    I cannot remember of what we talked during dinner. We have a hundred  subjects in common, and we look at so many aspects of the world through  the same pair of eyes; I only know that when I have been talking to her  for a period--there is no exact measurement of time for me when I am  with her--I leave her presence feeling \"completed.\" I feel that a sort  of gap within my being has been filled, that a spiritual hunger has  been satisfied, that I have got something which I wanted, but for which  I could not have formulated the desire in words. I had resolved that on  this first night I would bring matters between us to a head and end  this delicious but intolerable uncertainty as to how we stood; yet,  when old Babette had served us with coffee in the drawing-room, as I  call the second living-room, and we were alone together, I could not  bring up the subject. Partly because I think she prevented me so doing  by that skilful shepherding of the conversation into other paths with  an artfulness with which God endows all women, and also partly because  I could not screw myself up to the pitch. I could not, or rather would  not, put my fate to the touch. I had a presentiment that in reaching  for the summit I might fall from the slope. Alas! how true was this  foreboding in some senses--but I will keep all things in their right  order.    [Illustration: \"_The track met our ram_.\"]    [Illustration: In the flash I caught a glimpse of his conning tower]    Let it only be recorded that when she kissed me good-night (with the  tenderness of a mother) and left me to smoke a final cigar I had said  nothing, and I could only wonder at the strange fate that had placed me  practically alone with a girl whom I had grown to love with a deep  emotion, and who appeared to love me, yet often behaved as if I was her  brother.    The next day we were like two children. The snow was deep on the  ground, and the fir trees stood like thousands of sentinels in grey  uniform round the clearing. Once during the afternoon, as with Zoe's  assistance I was furiously chopping wood for the fire, a droning noise  made me look up, and thousands of metres overhead a small squadron of  aeroplanes, evidently bound for the Western Front, sailed slowly across  the sky. I thought how awkward it would be for them if they experienced  an engine failure whilst over the forest, though they were up so high  that I imagine they could have glided ten kilometres, and as I think  (but I am not certain, and I have pledged myself not to try and find  out) we were in the Forest of Montellan, which is barely fifteen  kilometres broad, I suppose they could have fallen clear of the trees.    As a matter of fact I imagine they would have used our clearing--I'm  glad they didn't.    That night after dinner she played to me, first Beethoven and then  Chopin. I can see her as I write; she had just finished the 14th  Prelude and, resting her chin on her hand, she smiled mysteriously at  me.    The hour had come, and, driven by strong impulses, I spoke. I told her  that I loved her as I had never thought that a man could love a woman;  I told her that I longed to shield her and protect her, and above all  things to remove her from the clutches of that bestial Colonel, and as  I bent over her and felt my senses swim in the subtleties of her  perfume, I begged her passionately to say the word that would give me  the right to fight the world on her behalf.    When I had finished she was silent for a long while, and I can remember  distinctly that I wondered whether she could hear the thump! thump!  thump! of my heart, which to my agitated mind seemed to beat with the  strength of a hammer.    At length she spoke; two words came slowly from her lips:    \"I cannot.\"    I was not discouraged. I could see, I could feel, that a tremendous  struggle was raging, the outward signs of which were concealed by her  averted head.    At length I asked her point-blank whether she loved me. Her silence  gave me my answer, and I took her unresisting body into my arms and  kissed her to distraction. Oh! these kisses, how bitter they seem to me  now, and yet how I long to hold her once again. For, freeing herself  from my embrace and speaking almost mechanically, she said:    \"Karl! I must tell you. I cannot marry you.\"    I pleaded, I prayed, I argued, I demanded. It was in vain; I always  came up against the immovable \"I cannot.\"    And then I crashed over the precipice towards whose edge I had been  blindly going. I had said for the hundredth time, \"But you know you  love me,\" when with a sob she abandoned all reserve, and, flinging her  arms round my neck, implored me to take her. Then, as I caught my  breath, she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#14)"],[1,"1] I told you of the bumble-bees which hover round me in some  fruitless quest, to the tune of a meaningless humming, with tireless  assiduity.    [Footnote 1: Not included in this selection.]    They come every day at about nine or ten in the morning, dart up to my  table, shoot down under the desk, go bang on to the coloured glass  window-pane, and then with a circuit or two round my head are off again  with a whizz.    I could easily have thought them to be departed spirits who had left this  world unsatisfied, and so keep coming back to it again and again in the  guise of bees, paying me an inquiring visit in passing. But I think  nothing of the kind. I am sure they are real bees, otherwise known, in  Sanskrit, as honey-suckers, or on still rarer occasions as  double-proboscideans.          SHELIDAH,    _16th (Phalgun) February_ 1895.      We have to tread every single moment of the way as we go on living our  life, but when taken as a whole it is such a very small thing, two hours  uninterrupted thought can hold all of it.    After thirty years of strenuous living Shelley could only supply material  for two volumes of biography, of which, moreover, a considerable space is  taken up by Dowden's chatter. The thirty years of my life would not fill  even one volume.    What a to-do there is over this tiny bit of life! To think of the quantity  of land and trade and commerce which go to furnish its commissariat alone,  the amount of space occupied by each individual throughout the world,  though one little chair is large enough to hold the whole of him! Yet,  after all is over and done, there remains only material for two hours'  thought, some pages of writing!    What a negligible fraction of my few pages would this one lazy day of mine  occupy! But then, will not this peaceful day, on the desolate sands by the  placid river, leave nevertheless a distinct little gold mark even upon the  scroll of my eternal past and eternal future?          SHELIDAH,    _28th February_ 1895.      I have got an anonymous letter to-day which begins:     To give up one's self at the feet of another,   is the truest of all gifts.    The writer has never seen me, but knows me from my writings, and goes on  to say:      However petty or distant, the Sun[1]-worshipper gets a share of the    Sun's rays. You are the world's poet, yet to me it seems you are my own    poet!    [Footnote 1: Rabi, the author's name, means the Sun.]    and more in the same strain.    Man is so anxious to bestow his love on some object, that he ends by  falling in love with his own Ideal. But why should we suppose the idea to  be less true than the reality? We can never know for certain the truth of  the substance underlying what we get through the senses. Why should the  doubt be greater in the case of the entity behind the ideas which are the  creation of mind?    The mother realises in her child the great Idea, which is in every child,  the ineffableness of which, however, is not revealed to any one else. Are  we to say that what draws forth the mother's very life and soul is  illusory, but what fails to draw the rest of us to the same extent is the  real truth?    Every person is worthy of an infinite wealth of love--the beauty of his  soul knows no limit.... But I am departing into generalities. What I  wanted to express is, that in one sense I have no right to accept this  offering of my admirer's heart; that is to say, for me, seen within my  everyday covering, such a person could not possibly have had these  feelings. But there is another sense in which I am worthy of all this, or  of even greater adoration.          ON THE WAY TO PABNA,    _9th July_ 1895.      I am gliding through this winding little Ichamati, this streamlet of the  rainy season. With rows of villages along its banks, its fields of jute  and sugar-cane, its reed patches, its green bathing slopes, it is like a  few lines of a poem, often repeated and as often enjoyed. One cannot  commit to memory a big river like the Padma, but this meandering little  Ichamati, the flow of whose syllables is regulated by the rhythm of the  rains, I am gradually making my very own....    It is dusk, the sky getting dark with clouds. The thunder rumbles  fitfully, and the wild casuarina clumps bend in waves to the stormy gusts  which pass through them. The depths of bamboo thickets look black as ink.  The pallid twilight glimmers over the water like the herald of some weird  event.    I am bending over my desk in the dimness, writing this letter. I want to  whisper low-toned, intimate talk, in keeping with this penumbra of the  dusk. But it is just wishes like these which baffle all effort. They  either get fulfilled of themselves, or not at all. That is why it is a  simple matter to warm up to a grim battle, but not to an easy,  inconsequent talk.          SHELIDAH,    _14th August_ 1895.      One great point about work is that for its sake the individual has to make  light of his personal joys and sorrows; indeed, so far as may be, to  ignore them. I am reminded of an incident at Shazadpur. My servant was  late one morning, and I was greatly annoyed at his delay. He came up and  stood before me with his usual _salaam_, and with a slight catch in  his voice explained that his eight-year-old daughter had died last night.  Then, with his duster, he set to tidying up my room.    When we look at the field of work, we see some at their trades, some  tilling the soil, some carrying burdens, and yet underneath, death,  sorrow, and loss are flowing, in an unseen undercurrent, every day,--their  privacy not intruded upon. If ever these should break forth beyond control  and come to the surface, then all this work would at once come to a stop.  Over the individual sorrows, flowing beneath, is a hard stone track,  across which the trains of duty, with their human load, thunder their way,  stopping for none save at appointed stations. This very cruelty of work  proves, perhaps, man's sternest consolation.          KUSHTEA,    _5th October 1895_.      The religion that only comes to us from external scriptures never becomes  our own; our only tie with it is that of habit. To gain religion within is  man's great lifelong adventure. In the extremity of suffering must it be  born; on his life-blood it must live; and then, whether or not it brings  him happiness, the man's journey shall end in the joy of fulfilment.    We rarely realise how false for us is that which we hear from other lips,  or keep repeating with our own, while all the time the temple of our Truth  is building within us, brick by brick, day after day. We fail to  understand the mystery of this eternal building when we view our joys and  sorrows apart by themselves, in the midst of fleeting time; just as a  sentence becomes unintelligible if one has to spell through every word of  it.    When once we perceive the unity of the scheme of that creation which is  going on in us, we realise our relation to the ever-unfolding universe. We  realise that we are in the process of being created in the same way as are  the glowing heavenly orbs which revolve in their courses,--our desires,  our sufferings, all finding their proper place within the whole.    We may not know exactly what is happening: we do not know exactly even  about a speck of dust. But when we feel the flow of life in us to be one  with the universal life outside, then all our pleasures and pains are seen  strung upon one long thread of joy. The facts: _I am, I move, I  grow_, are seen in all their immensity in connection with the fact that  everything else is there along with me, and not the tiniest atom can do  without me.    The relation of my soul to this beautiful autumn morning, this vast  radiance, is one of intimate kinship; and all this colour, scent, and  music is but the outward expression of our secret communion. This constant  communion, whether realised or unrealised, keeps my mind in movement; out  of this intercourse between my inner and outer worlds I gain such  religion, be it much or little, as my capacity allows: and in its light I  have to test scriptures before I can make them really my own.          SHELIDAH,    _12th December 1895._      The other evening I was reading an English book of criticisms, full of all  manner of disputations about Poetry, Art, Beauty, and so forth and so on.  As I plodded through these artificial discussions, my tired faculties  seemed to have wandered into a region of empty mirage, filled with the  presence of a mocking demon.    The night was far advanced. I closed the book with a bang and flung it on  the table. Then I blew out the lamp with the idea of turning into bed. No  sooner had I done so than, through the open windows, the moonlight burst  into the room, with a shock of surprise.    That little bit of a lamp had been sneering drily at me, like some  Mephistopheles: and that tiniest sneer had screened off this infinite  light of joy issuing forth from the deep love which is in all the world.  What, forsooth, had I been looking for in the empty wordiness of the book?  There was the very thing itself, filling the skies, silently waiting for  me outside, all these hours!    If I had gone off to bed leaving the shutters closed, and thus missed this  vision, it would have stayed there all the same without any protest  against the mocking lamp inside. Even if I had remained blind to it all my  life,--letting the lamp triumph to the end,--till for the last time I went  darkling to bed,--even then the moon would have still been there, sweetly  smiling, unperturbed and unobtrusive, waiting for me as she has throughout  the ages."]]]
