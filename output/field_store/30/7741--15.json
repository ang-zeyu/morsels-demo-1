NEW YORK        1909          FOR ALL LITTLE FRIENDS        OF        MR. MCGREGOR & PETER & BENJAMIN    [Illustration]    It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"    _I_ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then _I_ am not a  rabbit.    They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!    When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a  large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.    I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were  generally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    As there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow  cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.    Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish  heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.    Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper  bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always  tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.  One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had  \"shot\" into flower.    [Illustration]    The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another,  they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.    Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep  he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep  off the flies.    The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the  lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing  machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse  picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.    (I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a  woodmouse with a long tail.)    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.    The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.    While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a  heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a  sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!  Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of  grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.    They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.    Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little  brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them  for some time.    Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.    Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--    \"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped  them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was  turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still  they did not wake up.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.    He went to put away the mowing machine.    While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came  across the field.    She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?    [Illustration]    Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag  off his head, and they told the doleful tale.    Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.    But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the  bottom corner of the sack.    [Illustration]    The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.    Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows,  an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.    [Illustration]    Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.    [Illustration]    Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.    He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.    The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.    [Illustration]    They watched him go into his house.    And then they crept up to the window to listen.    [Illustration]    Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would  have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to  have been inside it.    They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--    \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs.  McGregor.    \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr.  McGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"    \"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"    \"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.    (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)    Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel  six, but they must be _old_ rabbits, because they were so hard and all  different shapes.    \"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"    \"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy  myself baccy!\"    \"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"    [Illustration]    Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.    When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr.  McGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"    [Illustration]    And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying  through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.    It was rather hurt.    [Illustration]    Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.    [Illustration]    So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her  rabbit skins.    [Illustration]    But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough  rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a  pair of warm mittens.

Co.    1916          THE TALE    OF    PETER RABBIT      Once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were  Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter.    [Illustration]    They lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a  very big fir tree.    \"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"You may go into  the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs.  McGregor.\"    [Illustration]    Now run along and don't get into mischief. I am going out.\"    Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through  the wood to the baker's.    [Illustration]    She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.    Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail who were good little bunnies went down  the lane together    [Illustration]    To gather blackberries.    [Illustration]    But Peter who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's  garden and    [Illustration]    Squeezed under the gate!    [Illustration]    First he ate some lettuces and some French beans    [Illustration]    And then    He  Ate  Some  Radishes    [Illustration]    And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.  McGregor!    Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,  but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out  \"Stop thief!\"    [Illustration]    Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,  for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.    [Illustration]    He lost one shoe among the cabbages, and the other amongst the  potatoes.    [Illustration]    After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster    [Illustration]    So that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not  unfortunately run into a gooseberry net    [Illustration]    And got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.    [Illustration]    It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.    [Illustration]    Peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears;    [Illustration]    But his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows    [Illustration]    Who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself.    Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop on the top  of Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in time.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Leaving his jacket behind him.    [Illustration]    He rushed into the tool-shed and--    [Illustration]    Jumped into a can.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so  much water in it. Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere  in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.    [Illustration]    He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.    Presently Peter sneezed \"Kertyschoo!\"    Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon  Peter, who    Jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with  fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.    Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.    After a time he began to wander about, going  lippity--  lippity--  not very fast and looking all around.    He found a door in a wall; but it was locked and there was no room  for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.    An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying  peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to  the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth she could not  answer. She only shook her head at him.    [Illustration]    Peter began to cry.    Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he  became more and more puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr.  McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some  gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her  tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away  without speaking to her.    [Illustration]    He had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.    He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,  he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.    Peter scuttered underneath the bushes, but presently as nothing  happened, he came out and    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.    The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was  turned towards Peter and beyond him was the gate!    Peter got down very quietly off the wheel-barrow and started running  as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black  currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but  Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and was safe at  last in the wood outside the garden.    Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a  scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Peter never stopped running or looked behind him    [Illustration]    Till he got home to the big fir-tree.    [Illustration]    He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the  floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy  cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.    It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost  in a fortnight!    I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His  mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose  of it to Peter! \"One teaspoonful to be taken at bedtime.\" But--    [Illustration]    Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for  supper.
