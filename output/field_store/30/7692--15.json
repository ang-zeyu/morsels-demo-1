The potential of one cell is from 1.9 to 2 volts with strong  solution, and the internal resistance varies from 0.108 to 0.170 of an  ohm with cells of the size described. In order to test the constancy of  the battery, a red heat was maintained in a platinum-iridium wire by the  current for six weeks, both day and night.    The absence or exhaustion of the zinc in any one cell in a battery is  indicated by the appearance of a red insoluble chromic salt of mercury,  in a finely divided state, floating in the faulty cell. It is then  necessary to drop in some pieces of zinc. The state of the zinc supply  may also be ascertained at any time by feeling about in the cells with a  stick. When not required, the battery may be washed by simply charging  the top reservoir with water, and leaving it to circulate in the usual  manner, or the solution may be withdrawn from each cell by a siphon. A  very small flow of the solution is sufficient to maintain the required  current for telegraphic working, but if the flow be stopped altogether  for a few hours, no difference is observed in the current, although when  the current is required to be maintained in a conductor of a few ohms  resistance, as in heating a platinum wire, it is necessary that the  circulation be maintained [heating a piece of platinum ribbon]. The  battery furnishing the current for producing the effect you now see is  of five cells, and as that number is reduced down to two, you see a glow  still appears in the platinum. The platinum strip employed was 5 inches  long and 1/8 inch wide, its resistance being 0.42 ohm, cold. That gives  an idea of the volume of current flowing. I have twelve electro magnets  in printing instruments joined up on the table, and [joining up the  battery] you see that the two cells are sufficient to work them. The  twelve electro-magnets are being worked (by the two cells) in multiple  arc at the same time. The current from the cells which heated the  platinum wire is amply sufficient to magnetize a Thomson recorder. I  have maintained five inches of platinum ribbon in a red hot state for  two hours, in order to make sure that the battery I was about to bring  before you was in good order. The cost of working such a battery when  waste solution cannot be obtained, and it is necessary to use specially  prepared bichromate solution, is about 21/4d. per cell per day, with a  current constantly active in a Thomson recorder circuit, or a resistance  of 11/2 ohms per cell; but if only occasionally used, the same quantity of  solution will last several weeks.    A comparison of this with another form of constant battery, the Daniell,  as used in telegraphy, shows that six of these cells, with a total  electromotive force of 12 volts and an internal resistance of 0.84 of  an ohm, cannot be replaced by less than 71 batteries of 10 cells each,  connected in multiple arc, or for quantity. This result, however large  it may appear, is considerably below that which may be obtained when  working telegraphic lines. A current of 0.02 weber, or ampere, will work  an ordinary sounder or direct writing Morse circuit; the cascade battery  is capable of working 100 such circuits at the same time, while the  combined resistance of that number of lines would not be below that in  which it is found that the battery is constant in action.    Objection may be made to the arrangement of the battery on the score of  waste of zinc by local action, because of the electro positive metal  being exposed to the chromic liquid; but if the battery be out of action  and the circulation stopped, the zinc amalgam is protected by the  immobility of the liquid and the formation of a dense layer of sulphate  of zinc on its surface. When in action, that effect is neutralized from  the fact that carbon in chromic acid is more highly electro-negative  than the chromate of mercury formed upon the zinc amalgam, and which  appears to be the cause of the dissolution of the zinc even when  amalgamated in the presence of chromic acid. The solution may be  repeatedly passed through the battery until the absence of the  characteristic warmth of color of chromic acid indicates its complete  exhaustion. During a description before the Society of thermo-electric  batteries some time ago, Mr. Preece mentioned that five of the  thermopiles which were being tried at the Post-Office were doing the  work of 2,535 of the battery cells previously employed. Thirty of  the cascade cells would have about the same potential as five such  thermopiles, but would supply three and a half times the current, and be  capable of doing the work of 8,872 cells if employed upon the universal  battery system in the same manner as the thermo batteries referred to.    Although this battery will do all that is required for a Thomson  recorder or a similar instrument much more cheaply in this country than  the tray battery, and with half the number of cells, I do not think it  would be the case in distant countries, on account of the difficulty and  cost of transport. A solid compound of chromic and sulphuric acids could  be manufactured which would overcome this difficulty, if permanent  magnetic fields for submarine telegraphic instruments continue to be  produced by electric vortices. In conclusion, and to enable comparisons  to be made, I may mention that the work this battery is capable of  performing is 732,482 foot pounds, at a total cost of 1s. 6d.           *       *       *       *       *      [FROM THE SCHOOL JOURNAL.]          PERFECTLY LOVELY PHILOSOPHY.      CHARACTERS: Laura and Isabel, dressed very stylishly, both with hats on.  Enter hand in hand.    _Laura_. My dear Isabel, I was so afraid you would not come. I waited  at that horrid station a full half hour for you. I went there early on  purpose, so as to be sure not to miss you.    _Isabel_. Oh, you sweet girl!    _L_. Now, sit right down; you must be tired. Just lay your hat there on  the table, and we'll begin to visit right off. (_Both lay their hats on  the table and stand near by_.)    _I_. And how have you been all the ages since we were together at  Boston?    _L_. Oh, well, dear; those were sweet old school days, weren't they. How  are you enjoying yourself now? You wrote that you were taking lessons in  philosophy. Tell me how you like it. Is it real sweet?    _I_ Oh, those I took in the winter were perfectly lovely! It was about  science, you know, and all of us just doled on science.    _L_. It must have been nice. What was it about?    _I_. It was about molecules as much as anything else, and molecules are  just too awfully nice for anything. If there's anything I really enjoy,  it's molecules.    _L_. Oh, tell me about them, dear. What are molecules?    _I_. They are little wee things, and it takes ever so many of them, you  know. They are so sweet! Do you know, there isn't anything but that's  got a molecule in it. And the professors are so lovely! They explained  everything so beautifully.    _L_. Oh, how I'd like to have been there!    _I_. You'd have enjoyed it ever so much. They teach protoplasm, too,  and if there's one thing that is too sweetly divine, it's protoplasm. I  really don't know which I like best, protoplasm or molecules.    _L_. Tell me about protoplasm. I know I should adore it!    _I_. 'Deed you would. It's just too sweet to live. You know it's about  how things get started, or something of that kind. You ought to have  heard the professors tell about it. Oh. dear! (_Wipes her eyes with  handkerchief_) The first time he explained about protoplasm there wasn't  a dry eye in the room. We all named our hats after the professors. This  is a Darwinian hat. You see the ribbon is drawn over the crown this way  (_takes hat and illustrates_), and caught with a buckle and bunch of  flowers. Then you turn up the side with a spray of forget me-nots.    _L_. Oh, how utterly sweet! Do tell me some more of science. I adore it  already.    _I_. Do you, dear? Well, I almost forgot about differentiation. I am  really and truly positively in love with differentiation. It's different  from molecules and protoplasms, but it's every bit as nice. And our  professor! You should hear him enthuse about it; he's perfectly bound up  in it. This is a differentiation scarf--they've just come out. All  the girls wear them--just on account of the interest we take in  differentiation.    _L_. What is it, anyway?    _I_. Mull trimmed with Languedoc lace, but--    _L_. I don't mean that--the other.    _I_. Oh, differentiation! That's just sweet. It's got something to  do with species. And we learn all about ascidians, too. They are the  divinest things! If I only had an ascidian of my own! I wouldn't ask  anything else in the world.    _L_. What do they look like, dear? Did you ever see one?    _I_. Oh, no; nobody ever did but the poor dear professors; but they're  something like an oyster with a reticule hung on its belt. I think they  are just _too_ lovely for anything.    _L_. Did you learn anything else besides?    _I_. Oh, yes. We studied common philosophy, and logic, and metaphysics,  and a lot of those ordinary things, but the girls didn't care anything  about those. We were just in ecstasies over differentiations, and  molecules, and the professor, and protoplasms, and ascidians. I don't  see why they put in those common branches; we couldn't hardly endure  them.    _L_. (_Sighs_.) Do you believe they'll have a course like that next  year?    _I_. I think may be they will.    _L_. Dear me! There's the bell to dress for dinner. How I wish I could  study those lovely things!    _I_. You must ask your father if you can't spend the winter in Boston  with me. I'm sure there'll be another course of Parlor Philosophy next  winter.

No matter how much  others may desire it, they may never invite each other.    During the week following a dinner party, it is etiquette for each  guest to call upon the hostess, and it is rude to delay the call  more than a fortnight.

THE form of invitations will be found on page 49.    An invitation to a ball should be sent out from two to three weeks  before the evening, and should be answered within a day or two of  being received.    As to the number of guests to be invited, no precise rules can be  laid down. The size of your room does not seem to be any guide.  The custom is to ask rather more than twice as many as your rooms  will hold; but one-third more will be enough, as it will allow of  disappointments at the last moment, even if all have accepted the  invitations. Besides, during the gayest of the season, the fashion  of going to several balls in one night necessitates ensuring the  presence of a sufficiently large number of guests all through the  evening. If you really wish for dancing, do not exceed the last  limits. If, however, your aim is to have the largest ball of the  season, a crush and crowd, to make a sensation, then invite your  entire visiting list, and endure the consequences.    A hundred guests constitute a \"ball;\" over that, a \"large ball;\"  under that, merely a \"dance.\"    One of the first requisites of a ball-room is thorough  ventilation, especially if there is a prospect of a large number  of guests.    One of the most desirable points in a ball is to have a  beautifully arranged room. The floor must be well waxed, and  perfectly even, and it is well to draw a cord across two-thirds of  it, not admitting more than can dance inside the space so cut off  at once. The French make their ball-rooms perfect flower-gardens.  Every comer has its immense bouquet; the walls are gracefully  wreathed; bouquets, baskets, and exquisitely decorated pots of  growing plants are placed in every available place. The  staircases, landings, and supper-room are all filled with floral  treasures, harmonizing with fine effect with the brilliant lights  and gay the dresses of the ladies. It adds to the effect to  conceal the musicians behind a screen of evergreen and flowers.    The dressing-rooms should be provided with two servants apiece,  and small cards, with the names of the invited guests upon them,  should be in readiness to pin to the wraps of each one.    In each dressing-room, have plenty of water, soap, and towels upon  the washstand, several brushes and combs, small hand-mirrors, pin-  cushions well filled, and stick pomade upon the bureau. The  ladies' room should also have hair-pins, a work-box in readiness  to repair any accidental rip or tear; cologne, hartshorn, and  salts, in case of faintness. The gentlemen's room should be  provided with a boot-jack, a whisk, and a clothes-brush.    No one should accept an invitation to a ball who cannot or who  will not dance. They are mere encumbrances. Nothing is more trying  to the feelings of a hostess than to see a number of wallflowers  ornamenting (?) her ball-room.    The hour at which one may go to a ball varies from ten o'clock in  the evening until daybreak. Any one who attends several balls in  one evening will, of course, find it impossible to appear at an  early hour at each one.    The lady of the house--who should, if possible, know the name of  everybody who enters the room--must stand near the door, so as to  receive her guests, to each of whom she must find something to  say, no matter how trifling. The host must also be near, to  welcome arrivals, and the sons to introduce people. The young  ladies must see that the dances are kept up, and should not dance  themselves till they have found partners for all their friends.  They may with perfect propriety ask any gentleman present to be  introduced to a partner, and he is bound to accept the invitation;  but the lady must be careful whom she asks. Many present may be  entire strangers to her. Miss A. has brought her betrothed; Miss  B. introduces her cousin, Captain ---, on a short leave of absence  from his regiment in Texas; Miss C. presents her brother, just  returned from California; Miss D. begs leave to introduce a cousin  on a short visit to the city; Miss E., a belle, has informed a  dozen or two of her admirers where they may bow to her on the  evening of the ball. All these strangers bow to the hostess, and  must be provided with partners. The \"Man in the Club Window\" says:    \"I have known a case where a distinguished-looking young man,  having declined the lady's invitation to dance, but being pressed  by,' I can't make up the lancers without you,' somewhat  reluctantly accepted, performed his part so well that his partner  was quite _eprise_ with him, and even ventured on a little  flirtation. You can imagine her dismay when, a little later in the  evening, she saw her charming acquaintance carrying up a pile of  plates from the kitchen to the supper-room. For the first time in  her life, she had danced with an occasional waiter.\"    If a gentleman act as escort to a lady, he must call at her house,  at"]]]
