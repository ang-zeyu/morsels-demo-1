Tom and Ned laughed long and loud, and then the young inventor  said:    \"Now look here, Rad. You've done me a mighty big service, though  you didn't know it, and I want to thank you. I'm sorry about your  arm, and I'll have the doctor look at it. But now I want you to  show me all the things you touched when you played that joke on  Koku. In some way you did what I haven't been able to do, You took  the picture. There's probably just one little thing I've  overlooked, and you stumbled on it by accident. Now go ahead and  show me.\"    Eradicate thought for a moment, and then said:    \"Well, I done turned on de current, laik I seen you done, Massa  Tom.\"    \"Yes, go on. You connected the telephone.\"    \"Yas, sah. Den I switched on that flyer thing yo' all has rigged  up.\"    \"You switched on the amplifier, yes. Go on.\"    \"An'--an' den I plugged in dish year wire,\" and the colored man  pointed to one near the top of the booth.    \"You switched on that wire, Rad! Why, great Scott, man! That's  connected to the arc light circuit--it carries over a thousand  volts. And you switched that into the telephone circuit?\"    \"Dat's what I done did, Massa Tom; yas, sah!\"    \"What for?\"    \"Why, I done want t' make mah voice good an' loud t' skeer dat  rascal Koku!\"    Tom stared at the colored man in amazement.    \"No wonder you got a shock!\" exclaimed the young inventor. \"You  didn't get all the thousand volts, for part of it was shunted off;  but you got a good charge, all right. So that's what did the  business; eh? It was the combination of the two electrical  circuits that sent the photograph over the wire.\"    \"I understand it now, Rad; but you did more than I've been able to  do. I never, in a hundred years, would have thought of switching  on that current. It never occurred to me. But you, doing it by  accident, brought out the truth. It's often that way in  discoveries. And Koku was standing in the other telephone booth,  near the plate there, when you switched in this current, Rad?\"    \"Yas, sah, Massa Tom. He were. An' yo' ought t' see him hop when  he heard mah voice yellin' at him. Ha! ha! ha!\"    Eradicate chuckled at the thought. Then a pain in his shocked arm  made him wince. A wry look passed over his face.    \"Yas, sah, Koku done jump about ten feet,\" he said. \"An'--an' den  I jump too. Ain't no use in denyin' dat fact. I done jump when I  got dat shock!\"    \"All right, Rad. You may go now. I think I'm on the right track!\"  exclaimed Tom. \"Come on, Ned, we'll try some experiments, and  we'll see what we can do.\"    \"No shocks though--cut out the shocks, Tom,\" stipulated his chum.    \"Oh, sure! No shocks! Now crowding busy and improve on  Eradicate's Angel Gabriel system.\"    Tom made a quick examination of the apparatus.    \"I understand it, I think,\" he said. \"Koku was near the plate in  the other booth when Rad put on the double current. There was a  light there, and in an instant his likeness was sent over the  wire, and imprinted on this plate. Now let's see what we can do.  You go to that other booth, Ned. I'll see if I can get your  picture, and send you mine. Here, take some extra selenium plates  along. You know how to connect them.\"    \"I think so,\" answered Ned.    \"This image is really too faint to be of much use,\" went on Tom,  as he looked at the one of Koku. \"I think I can improve on it. But  we're on the right track.\"    A little later Ned stood in the other booth, while Tom arranged  the wires, and made the connections in the way accidently  discovered by Eradicate. The young inventor had put in a new  plate, carefully putting away the one with the picture of the  giant, This plate could be used again, when the film, into which  the image was imprinted, had been washed off.    \"All ready, Ned,\" called Tom, over the wire, when he was about to  turn the switch. \"Stand still, and I'll get you.\"    The connection was made, and Tom uttered a cry of joy. For there,  staring at him from the plate in front of him was the face of Ned.    It was somewhat reduced in size, of course, and was not extra  clear, but anyone who knew Ned could have told he was at the other  end of the wire.    \"Do you get me, Tom?\" called Ned, over the telephone.    \"I sure do! Now see if you can get me.\"    Tom made other connections, and then looked at the sending plate  of his instrument, there being both a sending and receiving plate  in each booth, just as there was a receiver and a transmitter to  the telephone.    \"Hurray! I see you, Tom!\" cried Ned, over the wire. \"Say, this is  great!\"    \"It isn't as good as I want it,\" went on Tom. \"But it proves that  I'm right. The photo telephone is a fact, and now persons using  the wire can be sure of the other person they are conversing with.  I must tell dad. He wouldn't believe I could do it!\"    And indeed Mr. Swift was surprised when Tom proved, by actual  demonstration, that a picture could be sent over the wire.    \"Tom, I congratulate you!\" declared the aged inventor. \"It is good  news!\"    \"Yes, but we have bad news of Mr. Damon,\" said Tom, and he told  his father of the disappearance of the eccentric man. Mr. Swift at  once telephoned his sympathy to Mrs. Damon, and offered to do  anything he could for her.    \"But Tom can help you more than I can,\" he said. \"You can depend  on Tom.\"    \"I know that,\" replied Mrs. Damon, over the wire.    And certainly Tom Swift had many things to do now. He hardly knew  at what to begin first, but now, since he was on the right road in  regard to his photo telephone, he would work at improving it.    And to this end he devoted himself, after he had sent out a  general alarm to the police of nearby towns, in regard to the  disappearance of Mr. Damon. The airship clue, he believed, as did  the police, would be a good one to work on.    For several days after this nothing of moment occurred. Mr. Damon  could not be located, and Tom's airship might still be sailing  above the clouds as far as getting any trace of it was concerned.    Meanwhile the young inventor, with the help of Ned, who was given  a leave of absence from the bank, worked hard to improve the photo  telephone.            CHAPTER XV    THE AIRSHIP CLUE      \"Now Ned, we'll try again. I'm going to use a still stronger  current, and this is the most sensitive selenium plate I've turned  out yet. We'll see if we can't get a better likeness of you--one  that will be plainer.\"    It was Tom Swift who was speaking, and he and his chum had just  completed some hard work on the new photo telephone. Though the  apparatus did what Tom had claimed for it, still he was far from  satisfied. He could transmit over the wire the picture of a person  talking at the telephone, but the likeness was too faint to make  the apparatus commercially profitable.    \"It's like the first moving pictures,\" said Tom. \"They moved, but  that was about all they did.\"    \"I say,\" remarked Ned, as he was about to take his place in the  booth where the telephone and apparatus were located, \"this  double-strength electrical current you're speaking of won't shock  me; will it? I don't want what happened to Eradicate to happen to  me, Tom.\"    \"Don't worry. Nothing will happen. The trouble with Rad was that  he didn't have the wires insulated when he turned that arc current  switch by mistake--or, rather, to play his joke. But he's all  right now.\"    \"Yes, but I'm not going to take any chances,\" insisted Ned. \"I  want to be insulated myself.\"    \"I'll see to that,\" promised Tom. \"Now get to your booth.\"    For the purpose of experiments Tom had strung a new line between  two of his shops, They were both within sight, and the line was  not very long; but, as I have said, Tom knew that if his apparatus  would work over a short distance, it would also be successful over  a long one, provided he could maintain the proper force of  current, which he was sure could be accomplished.    \"And if they can send pictures from Monte Carlo to Paris I can do  the same,\" declared Tom, though his system of photo telephony was  different from sending by a telegraph system--a reproduction of a  picture on a copper plate. Tom's apparatus transmitted the  likeness of the living person.    It took some little time for the young inventor, and Ned working  with him, to fix up the new wires and switch on the current. But  at last it was complete, and Ned took his place at one telephone,  with the two sensitive plates before him. Tom did the same, and  they proceeded to talk over the wire, first making sure that the  vocal connection was perfect.    \"All ready now, Ned! We'll try it,\" called Tom to his chum, over  the wire. \"Look straight at the plate. I want to get your image  first, and then I'll send mine, if it's a success.\"    Ned did as requested, and in a few minutes he could hear Tom  exclaim, joyfully:    \"It's better, Ned! It's coming out real clear. I can see you  almost as plainly as if you were right in the booth with me. But  turn on your light a little stronger.\"    Tom could hear, through the telephone, his chum moving about, and  then he caught a startled exclamation.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom anxiously.    \"I got a shock!\" cried Ned. \"I thought you said you had this thing  fixed. Great Scott, Tom! It nearly yanked the arm off me! Is this  a joke?\"    \"No, old man. No, of course not! Something must be wrong. I didn't  mean that. Wait, I'll take a look. Say, it does seem as if  everything was going wrong with this invention. But I'm on the  right track, and soon I'll have it all right. Wait a second. I'll  be right over.\"    Tom found that it was only a simple displacement of a wire that  had given Ned a shock, and he soon had this remedied.    \"Now we'll try again,\" he said. This time nothing wrong occurred,  and soon Tom saw the clearest image he had yet observed on his  telephone photo plate.    \"Switch me on now, Ned,\" he called to his chum, and Ned reported  that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#14)"],[1,"in the spirit and not from without by the windows of thy  bodily wits, as thine ears, and thine eyes. For, as Jeremiah saith  plainly, by such windows cometh in death: Mors intrat per  fenestras.249 And this sufficeth, as little as it is, for answer to  the first, where thou askest of me, what is my conceit of thee, and  of these stirrings that thou speakest of to me in thy letter.    And touching the second thing, where thou askest of me my counsel in  this case, and in such other when they fall, I beseech almighty Jesu  (as He is cleped the angel of great counsel) that He of His mercy be  thy counsellor and thy comforter in all thy noye and thy nede, and  order me with His wisdom to fulfil in party by my teaching, so  simple as it is, the trust of thine heart, the which thou hast unto  me before many others--a simple lewd[250] wretch as I am, unworthy  to teach thee or any other, for littleness of grace and for lacking  of conning. Nevertheless, though I be lewd, yet shall I somewhat  say, answering to thy desire at my simple conning, with a trust in  God that His grace shall be learner and leader when conning of kind  and of clergy defaileth.[251] Thou wotest right well thyself that  silence in itself nor speaking, also singular fasting nor common  dieting, onliness nor company, all these nor yet any of them be not  the true end of our desire; but to some men (and not to all) they  are means helping to the end, if they be done lawfully and with  discretion, and else are they more letting than furthering. And  therefore plainly[252] to speak, nor plainly to be still, plainly to  eat, nor plainly to fast, plainly to be in company, or plainly to be  only, think I not to counsel thee at this time; for why, perfection  standeth not in them. But this counsel may I give thee generally, to  hold thee by in these stirrings, and in all other like unto these;  evermore where thou findest two contraries, as are these--silence  and speaking, fasting and eating, onliness and company, common  clothing of Christian religion and singular habits of divers and  devised brotherhoods, with all such other what so they be, the which  in themself are but works of kind[253] and of men. For thou hast it  by kind and by statute of thine outer man now for to speak and now  for to be still, now for to eat and now for to fast, now for to be  in company and now to be only, now to be common in clothing and now  to be in singular habit, ever when thee list, and when thou  seest[254] that any of them should be speedful and helply to thee in  nourishing of the heavenly grace working within in thy soul; but if  it be so (which God forbid), that thou or any other be so lewd and  so blinded in the sorrowful temptations of the midday devil, that ye  bind you by any crooked avow to any such singularities, as it were  under colour of holiness feigned under such an holy thraldom,[255]  in full and final destroying of the freedom of Christ, the which is  the ghostly habit of the sovereign holiness that may be in this  life, or in the other, by the witness of saint Paul saying thus: Ubi  spiritus Domini, ibi libertas: \"There where the spirit of God is,  there is freedom.\"[256] And thereto when thou seest that all such  works in their use may be both good and evil; I pray thee leave them  both, for that is the most ease for thee for to do, if thou wilt be  meek, and leave the curious beholding and seeking in thy wits to  look whether is better. But do thou thus: set the one on the one  hand, and the other on the other, and choose thee a thing the which  is hid between them; the which thing, when it is had, giveth thee  leave in freedom of spirit to begin and to cease in holding any of  the others at thine own full list, without any blame.    But now thou askest me, what is that thing. I shall tell thee what I  mean that it is: It is God; for whom thou shouldest be still, if  thou shouldest be still; and for whom thou shouldest speak if thou  shouldest speak; and for whom thou shouldest fast, if thou shouldest  fast; and for whom thou shouldest eat, if thou shouldest eat; and  for whom thou shouldest be only, if thou shouldest be only; and for  whom thou shouldest be in company, if thou shouldest be in company.  And so forth of all the remenant, what so they be. For silence is  not God, nor speaking is not God; fasting is not God, nor eating is  not God; onliness is not God, nor company is not God; nor yet any of  all the other such two contraries. He is hid between them, and may  not be found by any work of thy soul, but all only by love of thine  heart. He may not be known by reason, He may not be gotten by  thought, nor concluded by understanding; but He may be loved and  chosen with the true lovely will of thine heart.[257] Choose thee  Him, and thou art silently speaking, and speakingly silent,  fastingly eating, and eatingly fasting, and so forth of all the  remenant. Such a lovely choosing of God, thus wisely lesinge[258]  and seeking Him out with the true will of a clean heart, between all  such two leaving them both, when they come and proffer them to be  the point and the prick of our ghostly beholding, is the worthiest  tracing and seeking of God that may be gotten or learned in this  life. I mean for a soul that will be contemplative; yea, though all  that a soul that thus seeketh see nothing that may be conceived with  the ghostly eye of reason; for if God be thy love and thy meaning,  the choice and the point of thine heart, it sufficeth to thee in  this life (though all thou see never more of Him with the eyes of  thy reason all thy life time). Such a blind shot with the sharp dart  of longing love may never fail of the prick, the which is God, as  Himself saith in the book of love, where He speaketh to a  languishing soul and a loving, saying thus: Vulnerasti cor meum,  soror mea, amica mea, et sponsa mea, vulnerasti cor meum, in uno  oculorum tuorum: \"Thou hast wounded mine heart, my sister, my leman,  and my spouse, thou hast wounded mine heart in one of thine  eyes.\"[259] Eyes of the soul they are two: Reason and Love. By  reason we may trace how mighty, how wise, and how good He is in His  creatures, but not in Himself; but ever when reason defaileth, then  list, love, live and learn, to play,[260] for by love we may feel  Him, find Him, and hit Him, even in Himself. It is a wonderful eye,  this love, for of a loving soul it is only said of our Lord: \"Thou  hast wounded mine heart in one of thine eyes\"; that is to say, in  love that is blind to many things, and seeth but that one thing that  it seeketh, and therefore it findeth and feeleth, hitteth and  woundeth the point and the prick that it shooteth at, well sooner  than it should if the sight were sundry in beholding of many things,  as it is when the reason ransacketh and seeketh among all such  sere[261] things as are these: silence and speaking, singular  fasting and common eating, onliness or company, and all such other;  to look whether is better.    Let be this manner of doing, I pray thee, and let as thou wist not  that there were any such means (I mean ordained for to get God by);  for truly no more there is, if thou wilt be very contemplative and  soon sped of thy purpose. And, therefore, I pray thee and other like  unto thee, with the Apostle saying thus: Videte vocationem vestram,  et in ea vocatione qua vocati estis state:262 \"See your calling,  and, in that calling that ye be called, stand stiffly and abide in  the name of Jesu.\" Thy calling is to be very contemplative,  ensampled by Mary Magdalene. Do then as Mary did, set the point of  thine heart upon one thing: Porro unum est necessarium: \"For one  thing is necessary,\"[263] the which is God. Him wouldest thou have,  Him seekest thou, Him list thee to love, Him list thee to feel,[264]  Him list thee hold thee by, and neither by silence nor by speaking,  by singular fasting nor by common eating, by onliness nor by  companious woning, by hard wearing nor by easy; for sometime silence  is good, but that same time speaking were better; and againward  sometime speaking is good, but that same time silence were better;  and so forth of all the remenant, as is fasting, eating, onliness,  and company; for sometime the one is good, but the other is better,  but neither of them is at any time the best. And, therefore, let be  good all that is good, and better all that is better,[265] for both  they will defail and have an end; and choose thee the best with  Mary, thy mirror, that never will defail: Maria (inquit optimam)  optimam partem elegit, quae non auferetur ab ea.266 The best is  almighty Jesu, and He said that Mary, in ensample of all  contemplatives, had chosen the best, the which should never be taken  from her; and therefore, I pray thee, with Mary leave the good and  the better, and choose thee the best.    Let them be, all such things as are these: silence and speaking,  fasting and eating, onliness and company, and all such other, and  take no keep to them; thou wotest not what they mean, and, I pray  thee, covet not to wit; and if thou shall at any time think or speak  of them, think then and say that they are so high and so worthy  things of perfection, for to conne[267] speak, or for to conne be  still, for to conne fast, and for to conne eat, for to conne be  only, and to conne be in company, that it were but a folly and a  foul presumption to such a frail wretch as thou art, for to meddle  thee of so great perfection. For why, for to speak, and for to be  still, for to eat, and for to fast, for to be only, and for to be in  company, ever when we will, may we have by kind; but for to conne do  all these, we may not but by grace. And, without doubt, such grace  is never gotten by any mean of such strait silence, of such singular  fasting, or of such only dwelling that thou speakest of, the which  is caused from without by occasion of hearing and of seeing of any  other man's such singular doings.
