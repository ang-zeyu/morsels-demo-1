If this be not done, a period is rapidly put to the  formation of blood, and consequently to life.    This consideration enables us easily to explain how it happens that  the tissues yielding gelatine or chondrine, as, for example, the  gelatine of skin or of bones, are not adapted for the support of the  vital process; for their composition is different from that of  fibrine or albumen. It is obvious that this means nothing more than  that those parts of the animal organism which form the blood do not  possess the power of effecting a transformation in the arrangement  of the elements of gelatine, or of those tissues which contain it.  The gelatinous tissues, the gelatine of the bones, the membranes,  the cells and the skin suffer, in the animal body, under the  influence of oxygen and moisture, a progressive alteration; a part  of these tissues is separated, and must be restored from the blood;  but this alteration and restoration are obviously confined within  very narrow limits.    While, in the body of a starving or sick individual, the fat  disappears and the muscular tissue takes once more the form of  blood, we find that the tendons and membranes retain their natural  condition, and the limbs of the dead body their connections, which  depend on the gelatinous tissues.    On the other hand, we see that the gelatine of bones devoured by a  dog entirely disappears, while only the bone earth is found in his  excrements. The same is true of man, when fed on food rich in  gelatine, as, for example, strong soup. The gelatine is not to be  found either in the urine or in the faeces, and consequently must  have undergone a change, and must have served some purpose in the  animal economy. It is clear that the gelatine must be expelled from  the body in a form different from that in which it was introduced as  food.    When we consider the transformation of the albumen of the blood into  a part of an organ composed of fibrine, the identity in composition  of the two substances renders the change easily conceivable. Indeed  we find the change of a dissolved substance into an insoluble organ  of vitality, chemically speaking, natural and easily explained, on  account of this very identity of composition. Hence the opinion is  not unworthy of a closer investigation, that gelatine, when taken in  the dissolved state, is again converted, in the body, into cellular  tissue, membrane and cartilage; that it may serve for the  reproduction of such parts of these tissues as have been wasted, and  for their growth.    And when the powers of nutrition in the whole body are affected by a  change of the health, then, even should the power of forming blood  remain the same, the organic force by which the constituents of the  blood are transformed into cellular tissue and membranes must  necessarily be enfeebled by sickness. In the sick man, the intensity  of the vital force, its power to produce metamorphoses, must be  diminished as well in the stomach as in all other parts of the body.  In this condition, the uniform experience of practical physicians  shows that gelatinous matters in a dissolved state exercise a most  decided influence on the state of the health. Given in a form  adapted for assimilation, they serve to husband the vital force,  just as may be done, in the case of the stomach, by due preparation  of the food in general.    Brittleness in the bones of graminivorous animals is clearly owing  to a weakness in those parts of the organism whose function it is to  convert the constituents of the blood into cellular tissue and  membrane; and if we can trust to the reports of physicians who have  resided in the East, the Turkish women, in their diet of rice, and  in the frequent use of enemata of strong soup, have united the  conditions necessary for the formation both of cellular tissue and  of fat.          LETTER XI      My dear Sir,    In the immense, yet limited expanse of the ocean, the animal and  vegetable kingdoms are mutually dependent upon, and successive to  each other. The animals obtain their constituent elements from the  plants, and restore them to the water in their original form, when  they again serve as nourishment to a new generation of plants.    The oxygen which marine animals withdraw in their respiration from  the air, dissolved in sea water, is returned to the water by the  vital processes of sea plants; that air is richer in oxygen than  atmospheric air, containing 32 to 33 per cent. Oxygen, also,  combines with the products of the putrefaction of dead animal  bodies, changes their carbon into carbonic acid, their hydrogen into  water, and their nitrogen assumes again the form of ammonia.    Thus we observe in the ocean a circulation takes place without the  addition or subtraction of any element, unlimited in duration,  although limited in extent, inasmuch as in a confined space the  nourishment of plants exists in a limited quantity.    We well know that marine plants cannot derive a supply of humus for  their nourishment through their roots. Look at the great sea-tang,  the Fucus giganteus: this plant, according to Cook, reaches a height  of 360 feet, and a single specimen, with its immense ramifications,  nourishes thousands of marine animals, yet its root is a small body,  no larger than the fist. What nourishment can this draw from a naked  rock, upon the surface of which there is no perceptible change? It  is quite obvious that these plants require only a hold,--a fastening  to prevent a change of place,--as a counterpoise to their specific  gravity, which is less than that of the medium in which they float.  That medium provides the necessary nourishment, and presents it to  the surface of every part of the plant. Sea-water contains not only  carbonic acid and ammonia, but the alkaline and earthy phosphates  and carbonates required by these plants for their growth, and which  we always find as constant constituents of their ashes.    All experience demonstrates that the conditions of the existence of  marine plants are the same which are essential to terrestrial  plants. But the latter do not live like sea-plants, in a medium  which contains all their elements and surrounds with appropriate  nourishment every part of their organs; on the contrary, they  require two media, of which one, namely the soil, contains those  essential elements which are absent from the medium surrounding  them, i.e. the atmosphere.    Is it possible that we could ever be in doubt respecting the office  which the soil and its component parts subserve in the existence and  growth of vegetables?--that there should have been a time when the  mineral elements of plants were not regarded as absolutely essential  to their vitality? Has not the same circulation been observed on the  surface of the earth which we have just contemplated in the  ocean,--the same incessant change, disturbance and restitution of  equilibrium?    Experience in agriculture shows that the production of vegetables on  a given surface increases with the supply of certain matters,  originally parts of the soil which had been taken up from it by  plants--the excrements of man and animals. These are nothing more  than matters derived from vegetable food, which in the vital  processes of animals, or after their death, assume again the form  under which they originally existed, as parts of the soil. Now, we  know that the atmosphere contains none of these substances, and  therefore can replace none; and we know that their removal from a  soil destroys its fertility, which may be restored and increased by  a new supply.    Is it possible, after so many decisive investigations into the  origin of the elements of animals and vegetables, the use of the  alkalies, of lime and the phosphates, any doubt can exist as to the  principles upon which a rational agriculture depends? Can the art of  agriculture be based upon anything but the restitution of a  disturbed equilibrium? Can it be imagined that any country, however  rich and fertile, with a flourishing commerce, which for centuries  exports its produce in the shape of grain and cattle, will maintain  its fertility, if the same commerce does not restore, in some form  of manure, those elements which have been removed from the soil, and  which cannot be replaced by the atmosphere? Must not the same fate  await every such country which has actually befallen the once  prolific soil of Virginia, now in many parts no longer able to grow  its former staple productions--wheat and tobacco?    In the large towns of England the produce both of English and  foreign agriculture is largely consumed; elements of the soil  indispensable to plants do not return to the fields,--contrivances  resulting from the manners and customs of English people, and  peculiar to them, render it difficult, perhaps impossible, to  collect the enormous quantity of the phosphates which are daily, as  solid and liquid excrements, carried into the rivers. These  phosphates, although present in the soil in the smallest quantity,  are its most important mineral constituents. It was observed that  many English fields exhausted in that manner immediately doubled  their produce, as if by a miracle, when dressed with bone earth  imported from the Continent. But if the export of bones from Germany  is continued to the extent it has hitherto reached, our soil must be  gradually exhausted, and the extent of our loss may be estimated, by  considering that one pound of bones contains as much phosphoric acid  as a hundred-weight of grain.    The imperfect knowledge of Nature and the properties and relations  of matter possessed by the alchemists gave rise, in their time, to  an opinion that metals as well as plants could be produced from a  seed. The regular forms and ramifications seen in crystals, they  imagined to be the leaves and branches of metal plants; and as they  saw the seed of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#14)"],[1,"streets,  proclaiming everywhere the gospel and bearing testimony of its truth.    When the opposition of the priests increased in bitterness, and they  sought by every conceivable device to hinder the work and disturb  the meetings, Elder Taylor instructed several of the most zealous of  the brethren to hold auxiliary meetings simultaneously on the public  thoroughfares--just prior to the time appointed for the main central  meeting--and announce to their hearers that a discourse would be  delivered in the public hall, engaged for that purpose. In this way  an interest was awakened in the work, and the meetings crowded with  people, notwithstanding all the efforts of the hostile ministers to  prevent it.    These labors, and assisting in selecting the hymns suitable for  the worship of the Saints, together with reading the proofs and  superintending the printing of the Book of Mormon, occupied the early  summer of 1840.    In July, however, Elder Taylor took the Music Hall in Bold Street, a  large hall, capable of seating some fifteen hundred people, in which he  proposed delivering a course of lectures.    Pending the opening of this hall for the lectures, he went to Ireland  to proclaim the restoration of the gospel in that land. Among many  others he baptized in Liverpool was a Mr. McGuffie, who had some  acquaintances in Newry, County Down, Ireland. This man and a Brother  William Black he took with him as his companions.    A large company of Saints went with them to the dock to see them off.  It was but natural that Elder Taylor should contrast his situation, now  that he was departing for Ireland, with what it was when he landed in  England a few months before. Then he was friendless, unknown and among  strangers; now he was surrounded by a multitude of friends, anxious to  administer to his necessities and willing to assist him in his mission,  while few men in Liverpool were more sought for, or filled a larger  space in public attention.    The company remained on the pier-head waving their adieux until they  could no longer be seen.    The day after sailing, Elder Taylor and companions arrived in Newry,  a beautiful Irish village nestled among rolling hills, characteristic  of that part of Ireland. Brother McGuffie obtained the Court House  to hold a meeting in, and sent around the bell-man to give notice  of it. A congregation of six or seven hundred gathered in at seven  o'clock in the evening, and Elder Taylor preached to them. This was the  introduction of the gospel into Ireland.    An appointment was given out for the next evening, but only a  few attended, and Elder Taylor turned the meeting into a sort of  conversational, promising to explain anything those present wished to  know respecting the message he had delivered to them the night before.  Thus the evening was passed.    It was determined that night--as his stay in Ireland could only be  brief, in consequence of his appointments in Liverpool--that the next  day they would proceed to the other points they had proposed to visit.    In the night Elder Taylor in a vision saw a gentleman approach him  and ask him to stay, saying he would be pleased to hear him. The next  morning, as himself, Brothers McGuffie and Black and a gentleman of  the name of Thomas Tate were leaving the village in a jaunting car,  the same man whom Elder Taylor had seen in the vision stopped them and  requested him to remain; but as Brother McGuffie expected to return to  Newry and remain there some time, Elder Taylor concluded to go on his  way.    After a ride of seven miles through a beautiful, fertile, undulating  country, cut up into small farms by green hedges closely trimmed, and  plentifully dotted with neatly white-washed cottages, they arrived at  the four towns of Bellimacrat, where, in the evening, Elder Taylor  preached in a barn owned by a Mr. Willie. The following morning they  started on foot for the town of Lisburn, Mr. Tate going with them to  assist in carrying their valises. This Mr. Tate Elder Taylor had met  in Liverpool, and prophesied that he would be the first person to be  baptized in Ireland. As he and Elder Taylor walked on, side by side,  that beautiful, fresh morning they left Bellimacrat, the latter opened  the scriptures to his understanding and taught him the gospel in its  simplicity. The listener was carried away with admiration for the  plan of redemption which God had established for the salvation of His  children, and as conviction of its truth had taken hold of his mind, he  was ready to receive it; and on reaching the summit of a hill, which  suddenly brought them in full view of the beautiful Lock Brickland, he  cried out in ecstacy:    \"There is water, what doth hinder me being baptized?\"    At this the party stopped, and Elder Taylor, going down into the water,  baptized him. He was the first to receive the gospel in Ireland in this  dispensation.    In the town of Lisburn Elder Taylor preached four times in the market  place to large and attentive crowds.    The preaching in Market Square created considerable interest in that  place, but no one applied for baptism. The whole of County Down had  been considerably excited by the meetings held, and before leaving  Lisburn Elder Taylor learned that Brother McGuffie on his return to  Newry had begun to baptize.    Having thus opened the door of salvation to the Irish nation by the  proclamation of the gospel, Elder Taylor, on the 6th of August, took  passage on a steamer at Belfast for the city of Glasgow. On board  he formed the acquaintance of a gentleman who had met with Elder  Orson Pratt in Edinburgh, where that Apostle was laboring; and also  with an Irish gentleman from Belfast. The latter was a friend of a  Mr. Mulholland, of Illinois, who had written him an account of the  persecutions of the Saints in Missouri. He had the letter published in  one of the Belfast papers.    On arriving in Glasgow, Elder Taylor met with Elders Hedlock, Clark  and Mulliner, and the following Sunday preached to the Saints there,  and ordained two brethren Elders. He also visited a small branch  of the Church in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Here that love which the  gospel inspires in the hearts of those who receive it was abundantly  manifested. Though Elder Taylor was a stranger to the Saints there,  they gathered about him, pleaded with him to remain in their midst and  teach them something further concerning the Kingdom of God. Failing to  persuade him to remain longer, as the time for him to be in Liverpool  drew near, they flocked about him for his blessing, and it was not  until the night was gone and day was approaching that he could get a  chance to retire to rest.        CHAPTER X.    COURSE OF LECTURES--VISIT TO THE ISLE OF MAN--REFLECTIONS--LECTURES IN  DOUGLAS--OPPOSITION--CHALLENGE--DISCUSSIONS--SUCCESS.    Returning to Liverpool Elder Taylor delivered his course of lectures  in the Music Hall, Bold Street. The course covered the principal  events connected with the work of the Lord in these last days.  The transgression of the laws of the gospel; the changing of its  ordinances; the breaking of the covenant thereof after its introduction  by the personal ministration of the Son of God; the restoration of  the gospel through the ministration of angels; the restoration, and  the powers and authority of the Holy Priesthood; the coming forth,  character and value of the Book of Mormon; the gathering of Israel and  final redemption of the earth, etc., etc. The lectures were numerously  attended and created considerable interest in religious circles.    During his absence in Ireland and Scotland the local Elders in  Liverpool had been very active, and a number had been added to the  Church. He also found that Elders Curtis and Winchester had arrived  from New York. Both these Elders were able ministers of the word. The  latter had distinguished himself by his labors in Philadelphia, the  former in New York, near which city was his home. Elder Curtis was sent  to Ireland to continue the work commenced there.    Considerable opposition ran side by side with the labors of Elder  Taylor in Liverpool. The ministers belonging to the churches founded by  Mr. Matthews and his chief supporter, Mr. Aitkins, were the principals  in this opposition. They had been very near the truth at one time--not  far removed from the Kingdom of God; but having made up their minds  to reject it, the light they once possessed departed from them. They  were filled with bitterness, jealousy and hatred, and in their madness  descended to methods of opposition unworthy of those who profess to  be gentlemen, to say nothing of men who professed to be followers and  ministers of the Son of God. They raised commotions in some of the  meetings where Elder Taylor held forth that would have disgraced the  meetings in the very heat of a political campaign. They denounced him  whose doctrines they could not refute by the word of God or by reason,  as a liar, a wolf in sheep's clothing, a hypocrite, a false prophet,  and every other vile epithet that the malice of men or the ingenuity of  Satan could invent. Truly having rejected the truth, they were given up  to a hard heart and a reprobate mind.    Seeing that everything was moving along satisfactorily in Liverpool,  Elder Taylor determined to make his long contemplated visit to the  Isle of Man. He started on the 16th of September, 1840, having for  companions Elder Hiram Clark and Brother William Mitchel, one of the  first to receive his testimony in Liverpool. The party arrived in  Douglas the next day.    It was but natural that his arrival in this island should awaken his  remembrance of \"Nora,\" as he affectionately called his wife, Leonora.  Here she had spent her youthful days in the home of her father. Here,  amid the green hills and flower-flecked vales, which everywhere abound  in this delightful island, she had wandered in girlhood, buoyant with  hope and"]]]
