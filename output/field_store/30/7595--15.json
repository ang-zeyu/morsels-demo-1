It had been my  profession, for years past, to be in this close contact with young  girls of all ages, and of all orders of beauty.  I had accepted the  position as part of my calling in life; I had trained myself to leave  all the sympathies natural to my age in my employer's outer hall, as  coolly as I left my umbrella there before I went upstairs.  I had long  since learnt to understand, composedly and as a matter of course, that  my situation in life was considered a guarantee against any of my  female pupils feeling more than the most ordinary interest in me, and  that I was admitted among beautiful and captivating women much as a  harmless domestic animal is admitted among them.  This guardian  experience I had gained early; this guardian experience had sternly and  strictly guided me straight along my own poor narrow path, without once  letting me stray aside, to the right hand or to the left.  And now I  and my trusty talisman were parted for the first time.  Yes, my  hardly-earned self-control was as completely lost to me as if I had  never possessed it; lost to me, as it is lost every day to other men,  in other critical situations, where women are concerned.  I know, now,  that I should have questioned myself from the first.  I should have  asked why any room in the house was better than home to me when she  entered it, and barren as a desert when she went out again--why I  always noticed and remembered the little changes in her dress that I  had noticed and remembered in no other woman's before--why I saw her,  heard her, and touched her (when we shook hands at night and morning)  as I had never seen, heard, and touched any other woman in my life? I  should have looked into my own heart, and found this new growth  springing up there, and plucked it out while it was young.  Why was  this easiest, simplest work of self-culture always too much for me? The  explanation has been written already in the three words that were many  enough, and plain enough, for my confession.  I loved her.    The days passed, the weeks passed; it was approaching the third month  of my stay in Cumberland.  The delicious monotony of life in our calm  seclusion flowed on with me, like a smooth stream with a swimmer who  glides down the current.  All memory of the past, all thought of the  future, all sense of the falseness and hopelessness of my own position,  lay hushed within me into deceitful rest. Lulled by the Syren-song that  my own heart sung to me, with eyes shut to all sight, and ears closed  to all sound of danger, I drifted nearer and nearer to the fatal rocks.  The warning that aroused me at last, and startled me into sudden,  self-accusing consciousness of my own weakness, was the plainest, the  truest, the kindest of all warnings, for it came silently from HER.    We had parted one night as usual.  No word had fallen from my lips, at  that time or at any time before it, that could betray me, or startle  her into sudden knowledge of the truth.  But when we met again in the  morning, a change had come over her--a change that told me all.    I shrank then--I shrink still--from invading the innermost sanctuary of  her heart, and laying it open to others, as I have laid open my own.  Let it be enough to say that the time when she first surprised my  secret was, I firmly believe, the time when she first surprised her  own, and the time, also, when she changed towards me in the interval of  one night.  Her nature, too truthful to deceive others, was too noble  to deceive itself.  When the doubt that I had hushed asleep first laid  its weary weight on her heart, the true face owned all, and said, in  its own frank, simple language--I am sorry for him; I am sorry for  myself.    It said this, and more, which I could not then interpret.  I understood  but too well the change in her manner, to greater kindness and quicker  readiness in interpreting all my wishes, before others--to constraint  and sadness, and nervous anxiety to absorb herself in the first  occupation she could seize on, whenever we happened to be left together  alone.  I understood why the sweet sensitive lips smiled so rarely and  so restrainedly now, and why the clear blue eyes looked at me,  sometimes with the pity of an angel, sometimes with the innocent  perplexity of a child. But the change meant more than this.  There was  a coldness in her hand, there was an unnatural immobility in her face,  there was in all her movements the mute expression of constant fear and  clinging self-reproach.  The sensations that I could trace to herself  and to me, the unacknowledged sensations that we were feeling in  common, were not these.  There were certain elements of the change in  her that were still secretly drawing us together, and others that were,  as secretly, beginning to drive us apart.    In my doubt and perplexity, in my vague suspicion of something hidden  which I was left to find by my own unaided efforts, I examined Miss  Halcombe's looks and manner for enlightenment. Living in such intimacy  as ours, no serious alteration could take place in any one of us which  did not sympathetically affect the others.  The change in Miss Fairlie  was reflected in her half-sister.  Although not a word escaped Miss  Halcombe which hinted at an altered state of feeling towards myself,  her penetrating eyes had contracted a new habit of always watching me.  Sometimes the look was like suppressed anger, sometimes like suppressed  dread, sometimes like neither--like nothing, in short, which I could  understand.  A week elapsed, leaving us all three still in this  position of secret constraint towards one another.  My situation,  aggravated by the sense of my own miserable weakness and forgetfulness  of myself, now too late awakened in me, was becoming intolerable.  I  felt that I must cast off the oppression under which I was living, at  once and for ever--yet how to act for the best, or what to say first,  was more than I could tell.    From this position of helplessness and humiliation I was rescued by  Miss Halcombe.  Her lips told me the bitter, the necessary, the  unexpected truth; her hearty kindness sustained me under the shock of  hearing it; her sense and courage turned to its right use an event  which threatened the worst that could happen, to me and to others, in  Limmeridge House.        X    It was on a Thursday in the week, and nearly at the end of the third  month of my sojourn in Cumberland.    In the morning, when I went down into the breakfast-room at the usual  hour, Miss Halcombe, for the first time since I had known her, was  absent from her customary place at the table.    Miss Fairlie was out on the lawn.  She bowed to me, but did not come  in.  Not a word had dropped from my lips, or from hers, that could  unsettle either of us--and yet the same unacknowledged sense of  embarrassment made us shrink alike from meeting one another alone.  She  waited on the lawn, and I waited in the breakfast-room, till Mrs. Vesey  or Miss Halcombe came in.  How quickly I should have joined her: how  readily we should have shaken hands, and glided into our customary  talk, only a fortnight ago.    In a few minutes Miss Halcombe entered.  She had a preoccupied look,  and she made her apologies for being late rather absently.    \"I have been detained,\" she said, \"by a consultation with Mr. Fairlie  on a domestic matter which he wished to speak to me about.\"    Miss Fairlie came in from the garden, and the usual morning greeting  passed between us.  Her hand struck colder to mine than ever.  She did  not look at me, and she was very pale.  Even Mrs. Vesey noticed it when  she entered the room a moment after.    \"I suppose it is the change in the wind,\" said the old lady.  \"The  winter is coming--ah, my love, the winter is coming soon!\"    In her heart and in mine it had come already!    Our morning meal--once so full of pleasant good-humoured discussion of  the plans for the day--was short and silent.  Miss Fairlie seemed to  feel the oppression of the long pauses in the conversation, and looked  appealingly to her sister to fill them up.  Miss Halcombe, after once  or twice hesitating and checking herself, in a most uncharacteristic  manner, spoke at last.    \"I have seen your uncle this morning, Laura,\" she said.  \"He thinks the  purple room is the one that ought to be got ready, and he confirms what  I told you.  Monday is the day--not Tuesday.\"    While these words were being spoken Miss Fairlie looked down at the  table beneath her.  Her fingers moved nervously among the crumbs that  were scattered on the cloth.  The paleness on her cheeks spread to her  lips, and the lips themselves trembled visibly.  I was not the only  person present who noticed this. Miss Halcombe saw it, too, and at once  set us the example of rising from table.    Mrs. Vesey and Miss Fairlie left the room together.  The kind sorrowful  blue eyes looked at me, for a moment, with the prescient sadness of a  coming and a long farewell.  I felt the answering pang in my own  heart--the pang that told me I must lose her soon, and love her the  more unchangeably for the loss.    I turned towards the garden when the door had closed on her.  Miss  Halcombe was standing with her hat in her hand, and her shawl over her  arm, by the large window that led out to the lawn, and was looking at  me attentively.    \"Have you any leisure time to spare,\" she asked, \"before you begin to  work in your own room?\"    \"Certainly, Miss Halcombe.  I have always time at your service.\"    \"I want to say a word to you in private, Mr. Hartright.  Get your hat  and come out into the garden.  We are not likely to be disturbed there  at this hour in the morning.\"    As we stepped out on to the lawn, one of the under-gardeners--a mere  lad--passed us on his way to the house, with a letter in his hand.  Miss Halcombe stopped him.    \"Is that letter for me?\" she asked.    \"Nay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#14)"],[1," her from her  steadfast purpose of elevating herself. Reposing on God, she has thus  far journeyed securely. Still an invalid, she asks your sympathy, gentle  reader. Refuse not, because some part of her history is unknown, save by  the Omniscient God. Enough has been unrolled to demand your sympathy and  aid.    Do you ask the destiny of those connected with her EARLY history? A few  years only have elapsed since Mr. and Mrs. B. passed into another world.  As age increased, Mrs. B. became more irritable, so that no one, even  her own children, could remain with her; and she was accompanied by her  husband to the home of Lewis, where, after an agony in death  unspeakable, she passed away. Only a few months since, Aunt Abby entered  heaven. Jack and his wife rest in heaven, disturbed by no intruders; and  Susan and her child are yet with the living. Jane has silver locks in  place of auburn tresses, but she has the early love of Henry still, and  has never regretted her exchange of lovers. Frado has passed from their  memories, as Joseph from the butler's, but she will never cease to track  them till beyond mortal vision.          APPENDIX.      \"TRUTH is stranger than fiction;\" and whoever reads the narrative of  Alfrado, will find the assertion verified.    About eight years ago I became acquainted with the author of this book,  and I feel it a privilege to speak a few words in her behalf. Through  the instrumentality of an itinerant colored lecturer, she was brought to  W-----, Mass. This is an ancient town, where the mothers and daughters  seek, not \"wool and flax,\" but STRAW,--working willingly with their  hands! Here she was introduced to the family of Mrs. Walker, who kindly  consented to receive her as an inmate of her household, and immediately  succeeded in procuring work for her as a \"straw sewer.\" Being very  ingenious, she soon acquired the art of making hats; but on account of  former hard treatment, her constitution was greatly impaired, and she  was subject to seasons of sickness. On this account Mrs. W. gave her a  room joining her own chamber, where she could hear her faintest call.  Never shall I forget the expression of her \"black, but comely\" face, as  she came to me one day, exclaiming, \"O, aunt J-----, I have at last  found a HOME,--and not only a home, but a MOTHER. My cup runneth over.  What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?\"    Months passed on, and she was HAPPY--truly happy. Her health began to  improve under the genial sunshine in which she lived, and she even  looked forward with HOPE--joyful hope to the future. But, alas, \"it is  not in man that walketh to direct his steps.\" One beautiful morning in  the early spring of 1842, as she was taking her usual walk, she chanced  to meet her old friend, the \"lecturer,\" who brought her to W-----, and  with him was a fugitive slave. Young, well-formed and very handsome, he  said he had been a HOUSE-servant, which seemed to account in some measure  for his gentlemanly manners and pleasing address. The meeting was  entirely accidental; but it was a sad occurrence for poor Alfrado, as  her own sequel tells. Suffice it to say, an acquaintance and attachment  was formed, which, in due time, resulted in marriage. In a few days she  left W-----, and ALL her home comforts, and took up her abode in New  Hampshire. For a while everything went on well, and she dreamed not of  danger; but in an evil hour he left his young and trusting wife, and  embarked for sea. She knew nothing of all this, and waited for his  return. But she waited in vain. Days passed, weeks passed, and he came  not; then her heart failed her. She felt herself deserted at a time,  when, of all others, she most needed the care and soothing attentions of  a devoted husband. For a time she tried to sustain HERSELF, but this was  impossible. She had friends, but they were mostly of that class who are  poor in the things of earth, but \"rich in faith.\" The charity on which  she depended failed at last, and there was nothing to save her from the  \"County House;\" GO SHE MUST. But her feelings on her way thither, and  after her arrival, can be given better in her own language; and I trust  it will be no breach of confidence if I here insert part of a letter she  wrote her mother Walker, concerning the matter.    * * * \"The evening before I left for my dreaded journey to the 'house'  which was to be my abode, I packed my trunk, carefully placing in it  every little memento of affection received from YOU and my friends in  W-----, among which was the portable inkstand, pens and paper. My  beautiful little Bible was laid aside, as a place nearer my heart was  reserved for that. I need not tell you I slept not a moment that night.  My home, my peaceful, quiet home with you, was before me. I could see my  dear little room, with its pleasant eastern window opening to the  morning; but more than all, I beheld YOU, my mother, gliding softly in  and kneeling by my bed to read, as no one but you CAN read, 'The Lord is  my shepherd,--I shall not want.' But I cannot go on, for tears blind me.  For a description of the morning, and of the scant breakfast, I must  wait until another time.    \"We started. The man who came for me was kind as he could be,--helped me  carefully into the wagon, (for I had no strength,) and drove on. For  miles I spoke not a word. Then the silence would be broken by the driver  uttering some sort of word the horse seemed to understand; for he  invariably quickened his pace. And so, just before nightfall, we halted  at the institution, prepared for the HOMELESS. With cold civility the  matron received me, and bade one of the inmates shew me my room. She did  so; and I followed up two flights of stairs. I crept as I was able; and  when she said, 'Go in there,' I obeyed, asking for my trunk, which was  soon placed by me. My room was furnished some like the 'prophet's  chamber,' except there was no 'candlestick;' so when I could creep down  I begged for a light, and it was granted. Then I flung myself on the bed  and cried, until I could cry no longer. I rose up and tried to pray; the  Saviour seemed near. I opened my precious little Bible, and the first  verse that caught my eye was--'I am poor and needy, yet the Lord  thinketh upon me.' O, my mother, could I tell you the comfort this was  to me. I sat down, calm, almost happy, took my pen and wrote on the  inspiration of the moment--        \"O, holy Father, by thy power,      Thus far in life I'm brought;      And now in this dark, trying hour,      O God, forsake me not.        \"Dids't thou not nourish and sustain      My infancy and youth?      Have I not testimonials plain,      Of thy unchanging truth?        \"Though I've no home to call my own,      My heart shall not repine;      The saint may live on earth unknown,      And yet in glory shine.        \"When my Redeemer dwelt below,      He chose a lowly lot;      He came unto his own, but lo!      His own received him not.        \"Oft was the mountain his abode,      The cold, cold earth his bed;      The midnight moon shone softly down      On his unsheltered head.      \"But MY head WAS SHELTERED, and I tried to feel thankful.\"    ***    Two or three letters were received after this by her friends in W-----,  and then all was silent. No one of us knew whether she still lived or  had gone to her home on high. But it seems she remained in this house  until after the birth of her babe; then her faithless husband returned,  and took her to some town in New Hampshire, where, for a time, he  supported her and his little son decently well. But again he left her as  before--suddenly and unexpectedly, and she saw him no more. Her efforts  were again successful in a measure in securing a meagre maintenance for  a time; but her struggles with poverty and sickness were severe. At  length, a door of hope was opened. A kind gentleman and lady took her  little boy into their own family, and provided everything necessary for  his good; and all this without the hope of remuneration. But let them  know, they shall be \"recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\" God  is not unmindful of this work,--this labor of love. As for the afflicted  mother, she too has been remembered. The heart of a stranger was moved  with compassion, and bestowed a recipe upon her for restoring gray hair  to its former color. She availed herself of this great help, and has  been quite successful; but her health is again falling, and she has felt  herself obliged to resort to another method of procuring her bread--that  of writing an Autobiography.    I trust she will find a ready sale for her interesting work; and let all  the friends who purchase a volume, remember they are doing good to one  of the most worthy, and I had almost said most unfortunate, of the human  family. I will only add in conclusion, a few lines, calculated to  comfort and strengthen this sorrowful, homeless one. \"I will help thee,  saith the Lord.\"        \"I will help thee,\" promise kind      Made by our High Priest above;      Soothing to the troubled mind,      Full of tenderness and love.        \"I will help thee\" when the storm      Gathers dark on every side;      Safely from impending harm,      In my sheltering bosom hide.        \"I will help thee,\" weary saint,      Cast thy burdens ALL ON ME;      Oh, how cans't thou tire or faint,      While my arm encircles thee.        I have pitied every tear,      Heard and COUNTED every sigh;      Ever lend a gracious ear      To thy supplicating cry.      What though thy wounded bosom bleed,      Pierced by affliction's dart;      Do I not all thy sorrows heed,      And bear thee on my heart?      Soon will the lowly grave become      Thy quiet resting place;      Thy spirit find a peaceful home      In mansions NEAR MY FACE.        There are thy robes and glittering crown,      Outshining yonder sun;      Soon shalt thou lay the body down,      And put those glories on.    "]]]
