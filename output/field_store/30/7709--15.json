The wind is still from the  same quarter, and too strong for me to do anything to the plan, which is  a great annoyance. I will finish the survey of the runs from this place,  and send Campbell back to Oratunga with the plan. Herrgott did not return  until after sundown: he could not find the spring.    Monday, 16th May, Same Place. Sent Muller to the west; he returned at 10  o'clock, having found the spring about two miles and a half distant from  the camp; it is not hot, but a little warmer than milk-warm. There is a  good stream running from it, and the water is excellent; to me it has a  mineral taste, very good. There were some small fish lying dead on the  bank, near the mouth; they seemed to have been left there by the retiring  of the flood--they were quite dried up. I intended to have taken some  with me, but they were too dry--nothing but skin and bone. The creek  empties itself into the lake, about a mile north from where Chambers  Creek goes into it.    Tuesday, 17th May, Same Place. Again very cloudy, with a little rain.  Busy finishing the survey. Could not obtain an observation of the sun.  Wind still very strong.    Wednesday, 18th May, Same Place. Weather clearing up. Engaged with  survey.    Thursday, 19th May, Same Place. Finishing tracings, etc.    Friday, 20th May, Same Place. At sunrise started Campbell for Oratunga  with tracings, letter, etc., with orders to proceed to Finniss Springs,  thence to Herrgott Springs, thence to St. A'Becket's Pool, thence to  Mount Glenns, thence to Mount Stuart, and thence to Oratunga, taking six  days to perform the journey. Preparing my other plans for a start  to-morrow for the north-west, to see what the Davenport range is.  Latitude, 29 degrees 23 minutes 20 seconds.    Saturday, 21st May, Same Place. Started at 8 o'clock on a bearing of 310  degrees for the Davenport range. At twenty-two miles changed our course  to examine a large lagoon to the south-west of us, bearing 238 degrees.  At two miles reached the lagoon, which we examined for springs, but found  none. I suppose it receives Major Warburton's salt creek. It is caked  with a crust of salt, and is dry; it is seven miles long by three broad,  running north-west and south-west. On the south-west side it is bounded  by steep cliffs, and high sand hills on the top. Changed to 310 degrees,  our original course. Came upon some rain water at four miles, and camped  for the night. Distance to-day, twenty-eight miles.    Sunday, 22nd May, Rain Water. Sent Herrgott to examine the south-west  side of the lagoon which we passed last night, with orders to overtake me  by 11.30, so that I may get an observation of the sun at noon. The horses  having strayed some distance during the night, our start was delayed  until 9.15. Started on the same bearing as yesterday, 310 degrees.  Stopped at 11.20 for Herrgott to come with the instruments, but he did  not come up until 1.15, so that I lost my observation. I had told him, if  there was no appearance of springs not to go far, but to return  immediately; instead of which he went round the lagoon. Camped on a stony  rise, with a little wood. Distance to-day, twenty-one miles.    Monday, 23rd May, Stony Rise. Started towards the Davenport range. The  sand hills again commenced with beautiful feed upon them--low, with broad  valleys; they continued for five miles, when the stony plain again  commenced. The highest part of the range seems to be at the north-eastern  point, which has the appearance of a detached hill. At three miles and a  quarter from the last of the sand hills we saw the Douglas, and changed  our bearing to 328 degrees 30 minutes. At one mile and a quarter struck  the creek, but found no water in it. There were a number of gums, but not  very large, also plenty of myalls there. The bed of the creek is bad, and  will not retain water. We followed it down for three miles to see if  there was water; but no sign of it, the creek still continuing broad and  sandy. I was obliged to return to where I struck it, because it was  nearly sundown, and I had found a little rain water about a mile to the  south, which would do for the horses in the morning.    Tuesday, 24th May, The Douglas. Herrgott's horse in want of shoes. Could  not get a start until late. Found a little more rain water in a clay-pan.  If I can find no water near the range, I shall have to fall back upon  Strangway Springs. I am anxious to see what is on the other side of the  range, or I would run this creek down. There are numerous tracks of  natives about the creek; we have also seen three fires three or four days  old. Latitude, 28 degrees 45 minutes 4 seconds. Started at 12.30 on a  bearing of 313 degrees for the highest point of the range east, over  stony table land. The creek runs in the same direction for four miles, it  then turns to the westward, and is lost sight of among some hills. At ten  miles struck a stony box-tree creek; its bed was sand and gravel, but no  water. At 11.30 descended from the table land, and camped at a gum creek  at sundown; the bed the same as the last, and no water. There were  numerous native foot-tracks here also. I am sorry I could not reach the  range to-night, but we had some very bad ground to travel over, and no  water.    Wednesday, 25th May, Dry Gum Creek. Examined the creek for water, but  found none. Started on the same course as yesterday, 313 degrees, for the  north-east highest point, which I suppose to be the Mount Margaret of  Major Warburton. Native tracks seen in the creek. There may be water some  distance down the creek, but here it is too sandy to retain it. At four  miles struck another gum creek in turning round the south side of the  range; it was of the same description as the others, too sandy to hold  water. Proceeded towards the highest point of the range, and obtained an  observation of the sun within a mile and a half of the mount. Left the  horses in charge of Muller and ascended the mount, which was very  difficult; it took us an hour to go up, and three-quarters of an hour to  come down. The hill is composed of a greenish slate, lying horizontally  at the base, and courses of quartz and granite, with ironstone; but I can  see nothing of Major Warburton's quartz cliffs; they must be more to the  south-west. The range has a very peculiar appearance from a short  distance off; it seems to be an immense number of rugged conical hills  all thrown together. From the top, the view to the north-west was hidden  by a higher point of the range. To the north-north-west there is another  range, about twenty miles distant, apparently higher than this, running  south-west and north-east. To the north is another far-distant range; to  the east, broken hill and stony plain, with a number of clay-pans. A  number of creeks run to the eastward from this range; they become gum  creeks further down, but in and close to the range they have myall  bushes, and other shrubs. No water to be obtained in this range. Changed  my course to the north-east to examine a white clay-pan that I thought  might contain some fresh water. At three miles came upon it, and was very  much disappointed to find it salt. This being the second day that the  horses have been without water, I must give up the search for springs and  return to one mile south of the Douglas, where we had found a little rain  water. It being nearly sundown, I made for the last large gum creek,  striking it lower down, also cutting the other creeks between, hoping to  find water in some, but there was none. Made the large gum creek at 10  o'clock. Camped for the night. Horses very much done up, in consequence  of the ground that we have been travelling over being so rotten and  stony. The country is not good, nor the range; but at three miles to the  east it becomes less stony and better grassed. No water.    Thursday, 26th May, Large Gum Creek. Started at daylight for beyond the  Douglas. At 3 o'clock arrived at water. Horses so much done up that I  shall require to give them two days' rest, if the water will hold so  long, and then I must return to the Strangway Springs, as we know that to  be permanent water. There are some heavy clouds coming up from the  south-west, which I hope will bring rain.    Friday, 27th May, The Douglas. Rain all gone after a slight shower, which  did not assist me much. Very sorry for it.    Saturday, 28th May, The Douglas. Horses looking better this morning, so I  will give them this day also. I have sent Muller down the creek to the  eastward, to see if there is any water in it. I should have gone again  to-day to the Davenport range, to see if I could find the quartz reefs by  striking it more to the south-west, but it would be too much for the  horses, which are my mainstay, and this water will not last longer than  to-day; it is going very fast. I do wish to goodness it would rain, for I  do hate going back. Muller returned at sundown. He has been about twelve  miles down the creek, but can find no water. It still continued sandy. He  shot three new parrots.    Sunday, 29th May, The Douglas. Not being satisfied with my hurried  examination of the range, I shall make another attempt to-day, and  endeavour to find water. If we do not succeed we must fall back upon the  springs. Started on a course of west-north-west. Crossed the Douglas  three times. It turned to the south-west, but I continued my course, over  low hills and valleys, with plenty of feed, with quartz, ironstone, and  granite. At fifteen miles changed a little more to the north towards a  rise. The country becomes very broken and rough, but still plenty of  grass. At twenty miles crossed the upper part of the gum creek that I  camped on on the 25th instant. The banks are nearly perpendicular cliffs  of slate. Followed it up for two miles, but no water. I continued my  course for the rising ground. At six miles I found that I was getting  upon high"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#14)"],[1,"worse to be stone deaf,' said Isabel.    'I believe it is,' said Bertie. 'Are there compensations?' he added, to  Maurice.    'Yes. You cease to bother about a great many things.' Again Maurice  stretched his figure, stretched the strong muscles of his back, and  leaned backwards, with uplifted face.    'And that is a relief,' said Bertie. 'But what is there in place of the  bothering? What replaces the activity?'    There was a pause. At length the blind man replied, as out of a  negligent, unattentive thinking:    'Oh, I don't know. There's a good deal when you're not active.'    'Is there?' said Bertie. 'What, exactly? It always seems to me that when  there is no thought and no action, there is nothing.'    Again Maurice was slow in replying.    'There is something,' he replied. 'I couldn't tell you what it is.'    And the talk lapsed once more, Isabel and Bertie chatting gossip and  reminiscence, the blind man silent.    At length Maurice rose restlessly, a big, obtrusive figure. He felt tight  and hampered. He wanted to go away.    'Do you mind,' he said, 'if I go and speak to Wernham?'    'No--go along, dear,' said Isabel.    And he went out. A silence came over the two friends. At length Bertie  said:    'Nevertheless, it is a great deprivation, Cissie.'    'It is, Bertie. I know it is.'    'Something lacking all the time,' said Bertie.    'Yes, I know. And yet--and yet--Maurice is right. There is something  else, something _there_, which you never knew was there, and which you  can't express.'    'What is there?' asked Bertie.    'I don't know--it's awfully hard to define it--but something  strong and immediate. There's something strange in Maurice's  presence--indefinable--but I couldn't do without it. I agree that it  seems to put one's mind to sleep. But when we're alone I miss nothing; it  seems awfully rich, almost splendid, you know.'    'I'm afraid I don't follow,' said Bertie.    They talked desultorily. The wind blew loudly outside, rain chattered on  the window-panes, making a sharp, drum-sound, because of the closed,  mellow-golden shutters inside. The logs burned slowly, with hot, almost  invisible small flames. Bertie seemed uneasy, there were dark circles  round his eyes. Isabel, rich with her approaching maternity, leaned  looking into the fire. Her hair curled in odd, loose strands, very  pleasing to the man. But she had a curious feeling of old woe in her  heart, old, timeless night-woe.    'I suppose we're all deficient somewhere,' said Bertie.    'I suppose so,' said Isabel wearily.    'Damned, sooner or later.'    'I don't know,' she said, rousing herself. 'I feel quite all right, you  know. The child coming seems to make me indifferent to everything, just  placid. I can't feel that there's anything to trouble about, you know.'    'A good thing, I should say,' he replied slowly.    'Well, there it is. I suppose it's just Nature. If only I felt I needn't  trouble about Maurice, I should be perfectly content--'    'But you feel you must trouble about him?'    'Well--I don't know--' She even resented this much effort.    The evening passed slowly. Isabel looked at the clock. 'I say,' she said.  'It's nearly ten o'clock. Where can Maurice be? I'm sure they're all in  bed at the back. Excuse me a moment.'    She went out, returning almost immediately.    'It's all shut up and in darkness,' she said. 'I wonder where he is. He  must have gone out to the farm--'    Bertie looked at her.    'I suppose he'll come in,' he said.    'I suppose so,' she said. 'But it's unusual for him to be out now.'    'Would you like me to go out and see?'    'Well--if you wouldn't mind. I'd go, but--' She did not want to make the  physical effort.    Bertie put on an old overcoat and took a lantern. He went out from the  side door. He shrank from the wet and roaring night. Such weather had a  nervous effect on him: too much moisture everywhere made him feel almost  imbecile. Unwilling, he went through it all. A dog barked violently at  him. He peered in all the buildings. At last, as he opened the upper door  of a sort of intermediate barn, he heard a grinding noise, and looking  in, holding up his lantern, saw Maurice, in his shirt-sleeves, standing  listening, holding the handle of a turnip-pulper. He had been pulping  sweet roots, a pile of which lay dimly heaped in a corner behind him.    'That you, Wernham?' said Maurice, listening.    'No, it's me,' said Bertie.    A large, half-wild grey cat was rubbing at Maurice's leg. The blind  man stooped to rub its sides. Bertie watched the scene, then  unconsciously entered and shut the door behind him, He was in a high sort  of barn-place, from which, right and left, ran off the corridors in front  of the stalled cattle. He watched the slow, stooping motion of the other  man, as he caressed the great cat.    Maurice straightened himself.    'You came to look for me?' he said.    'Isabel was a little uneasy,' said Bertie.    'I'll come in. I like messing about doing these jobs.'    The cat had reared her sinister, feline length against his leg, clawing  at his thigh affectionately. He lifted her claws out of his flesh.    'I hope I'm not in your way at all at the Grange here,' said Bertie,  rather shy and stiff.    'My way? No, not a bit. I'm glad Isabel has somebody to talk to. I'm  afraid it's I who am in the way. I know I'm not very lively company.  Isabel's all right, don't you think? She's not unhappy, is she?'    'I don't think so.'    'What does she say?'    'She says she's very content--only a little troubled about you.'    'Why me?'    'Perhaps afraid that you might brood,' said Bertie, cautiously.    'She needn't be afraid of that.' He continued to caress the flattened  grey head of the cat with his fingers. 'What I am a bit afraid of,' he  resumed, 'is that she'll find me a dead weight, always alone with me down  here.'    'I don't think you need think that,' said Bertie, though this was what he  feared himself.    'I don't know,' said Maurice. 'Sometimes I feel it isn't fair that she's  saddled with me.' Then he dropped his voice curiously. 'I say,' he asked,  secretly struggling, 'is my face much disfigured? Do you mind telling  me?'    'There is the scar,' said Bertie, wondering. 'Yes, it is a disfigurement.  But more pitiable than shocking.'    'A pretty bad scar, though,' said Maurice.    'Oh, yes.'    There was a pause.    'Sometimes I feel I am horrible,' said Maurice, in a low voice, talking  as if to himself. And Bertie actually felt a quiver of horror.    'That's nonsense,' he said.    Maurice again straightened himself, leaving the cat.    'There's no telling,' he said. Then again, in an odd tone, he added: 'I  don't really know you, do I?'    'Probably not,' said Bertie.    'Do you mind if I touch you?'    The lawyer shrank away instinctively. And yet, out of very philanthropy,  he said, in a small voice: 'Not at all.'    But he suffered as the blind man stretched out a strong, naked hand to  him. Maurice accidentally knocked off Bertie's hat.    'I thought you were taller,' he said, starting. Then he laid his hand on  Bertie Reid's head, closing the dome of the skull in a soft, firm grasp,  gathering it, as it were; then, shifting his grasp and softly closing  again, with a fine, close pressure, till he had covered the skull and the  face of the smaller man, tracing the brows, and touching the full, closed  eyes, touching the small nose and the nostrils, the rough, short  moustache, the mouth, the rather strong chin. The hand of the blind man  grasped the shoulder, the arm, the hand of the other man. He seemed to  take him, in the soft, travelling grasp.    'You seem young,' he said quietly, at last.    The lawyer stood almost annihilated, unable to answer.    'Your head seems tender, as if you were young,' Maurice repeated. 'So do  your hands. Touch my eyes, will you?--touch my scar.'    Now Bertie quivered with revulsion. Yet he was under the power of the  blind man, as if hypnotized. He lifted his hand, and laid the fingers  on the scar, on the scarred eyes. Maurice suddenly covered them with  his own hand, pressed the fingers of the other man upon his disfigured  eye-sockets, trembling in every fibre, and rocking slightly, slowly, from  side to side. He remained thus for a minute or more, whilst Bertie stood  as if in a swoon, unconscious, imprisoned.    Then suddenly Maurice removed the hand of the other man from his brow,  and stood holding it in his own.    'Oh, my God' he said, 'we shall know each other now, shan't we? We shall  know each other now.'    Bertie could not answer. He gazed mute and terror-struck, overcome by his  own weakness. He knew he could not answer. He had an unreasonable fear,  lest the other man should suddenly destroy him. Whereas Maurice was  actually filled with hot, poignant love, the passion of friendship.  Perhaps it was this very passion of friendship which Bertie shrank from  most.    'We're all right together now, aren't we?' said Maurice. 'It's all right  now, as long as we live, so far as we're concerned?'    'Yes,' said Bertie, trying by any means to escape.    Maurice stood with head lifted, as if listening. The new delicate  fulfilment of mortal friendship had come as a revelation and surprise to  him, something exquisite and unhoped-for. He seemed to be listening to  hear if it were real.    Then he turned for his coat.    'Come,' he said, 'we'll go to Isabel.'    Bertie took the lantern and opened the door. The cat disappeared. The two  men went in silence along the causeways. Isabel, as they came, thought  their footsteps sounded strange. She looked up pathetically and anxiously  for their entrance. There seemed a curious elation about Maurice. Bertie  was haggard, with sunken eyes.    'What is it?' she asked.    'We've become friends,' said Maurice, standing with his feet apart, like  a strange colossus.    'Friends!' re-echoed Isabel. And she looked again at Bertie. He met her  eyes"]]]
