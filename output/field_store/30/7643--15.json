SENTENCES CLASSIFIED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR MEANING.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--You have already become acquainted with  three kinds of sentences. Can you name them?    +P+.--The Simple sentence, the Complex, and the Compound.    +T+.--These classes have been made with regard to the _form_ of the  sentence. We will now arrange sentences in classes with regard to their  _meaning_.    _Mary sings. Does Mary sing? Sing, Mary. How Mary sings!_ Here are four  simple sentences. Do they all _mean_ the same thing?    +P+.--They do not.    +T+.--Well, you see they differ. Let me tell you wherein. The first one  tells a fact, the second asks a question, the third expresses a command,  and the fourth expresses sudden thought or strong feeling. We call the  first a +Declarative sentence+, the second an +Interrogative sentence+, the  third an +Imperative sentence+, and the fourth an +Exclamatory sentence+.      +DEFINITION.--A _Declarative Sentence_ is one that is used to affirm or to  deny+.    +DEFINITION.--An _Interrogative Sentence_ is one that expresses a  question+.    +DEFINITION.--An _Imperative Sentence_ is one that expresses a command or  an entreaty+.    +DEFINITION.--An _Exclamatory Sentence_ is one that expresses sudden  thought or strong feeling+.    +INTERROGATION POINT--RULE.--Every direct interrogative sentence should be  followed by an interrogation point+. [Footnote: To The Teacher.--See Notes,  pp. 178, 179.]      SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Change each of the following declarative sentences into three interrogative  sentences, and tell how the change was made.    +Model+.--_Girls can skate. Can girls skate? How can girls skate? What  girls can skate?_ You are happy. Parrots can talk. Low houses were built.    Change each of the following into an imperative sentence. Notice that  independent words are set off by the comma.    +Model+.--_Carlo eats his dinner. Eat your dinner, Carlo_. George plays the  flute. Birdie stands on one leg.    Change each of the following into exclamatory sentences.    +Model+.--_You are happy. How happy you are! What a happy child you are!  You are so happy!_    Time flies swiftly. I am glad to see you. A refreshing shower fell. Lapland  is a cold country. It is hot between the tropics.

ANALYSIS AND PARSING.    MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES IN REVIEW.    In the analysis, classify these sentences first with reference to their  _form_, and then with reference to their _meaning_.    1. Wickedness is often made a substitute for wit.  2. Alfred was a brave, pious, and patriotic prince.  3. The throne of Philip trembles while Demosthenes speaks.  4.

Boston "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#14)"],[1,"may be supposed to pass partly to the  state of gelatine. The coagulum of the papaw-tree, when newly  prepared, being thrown into water, softens, dissolves in part, and  gives a yellowish tint to the fluid. The milk, placed in contact with  water only, forms also membranes. In an instant a tremulous jelly is  precipitated, resembling starch. This phenomenon is particularly  striking if the water employed be heated to 40 or 60 degrees. The  jelly condenses in proportion as more water is poured upon it. It  preserves a long time its whiteness, only growing yellow by the  contact of a few drops of nitric acid. Guided by the experiments of  Fourcroy and Vauquelin on the juice of the hevea, I mixed a solution  of carbonate of soda with the milk of the papaw. No clot is formed,  even when pure water is poured on a mixture of the milk with the  alkaline solution. The membranes appear only when, by adding an acid,  the soda is neutralized, and the acid is in excess. I made the  coagulum formed by nitric acid, the juice of lemons, or hot water,  likewise disappear by mixing it with carbonate of soda. The sap again  becomes milky and liquid, as in its primitive state; but this  experiment succeeds only when the coagulum has been recently formed.    On comparing the milky juices of the papaw, the cow-tree, and the  hevea, there appears a striking analogy between the juices which  abound in caseous matter, and those in which caoutchouc prevails. All  the white and newly prepared caoutchouc, as well as the waterproof  cloaks, manufactured in Spanish America by placing a layer of milk of  hevea between two pieces of cloth, exhale an animal and nauseating  smell. This seems to indicate that the caoutchouc, in coagulating,  carries with it the caseum, which is perhaps only an altered albumen.    The produce of the bread-fruit tree can no more be considered as bread  than plantains before the state of maturity, or the tuberous and  amylaceous roots of the cassava, the dioscorea, the Convolvulus  batatas, and the potato. The milk of the cow-tree contains, on the  contrary, a caseous matter, like the milk of mammiferous animals.  Advancing to more general considerations, we may regard, with M.  Gay-Lussac, the caoutchouc as the oily part--the butter of vegetable  milk. We find in the milk of plants caseum and caoutchouc; in the milk  of animals, caseum and butter. The proportions of the two albuminous  and oily principles differ in the various species of animals and of  lactescent plants. In these last they are most frequently mixed with  other substances hurtful as food; but of which the separation might  perhaps be obtained by chemical processes. A vegetable milk becomes  nourishing when it is destitute of acrid and narcotic principles; and  abounds less in caoutchouc than in caseous matter.*    (* The milk of the lactescent agarics has not been separately  analysed; it contains an acrid principle in the Agaricus piperatus,  and in other species it is sweet and harmless. The experiments of MM.  Braconnot, Bouillon-Lagrange, and Vauquelin (Annales de Chimie, volume  46, volume 51, volume 79, volume 80, volume 85, have pointed out a  great quantity of albumen in the substance of the Agaricus deliciosus,  an edible mushroom. It is this albumen contained in their juice which  renders them so hard when boiled. It has been proved that morels  (Morchella esculenta) can be converted into sebaceous and adipocerous  matter, capable of being used in the fabrication of soap. (De  Candolle, sur les Proprietes medicinales des Plantes.) Saccharine  matter has also been found in mushrooms by Gunther. It is in the  family of the fungi, more especially in the clavariae, phalli,  helvetiae, the merulii, and the small gymnopae which display  themselves in a few hours after a storm of rain, that organic nature  produces with most rapidity the greatest variety of chemical  principles--sugar, albumen, adipocire, acetate of potash, fat,  ozmazome, the aromatic principles, etc. It would be interesting to  examine, besides the milk of the lactescent fungi, those species  which, when cut in pieces, change their colour on the contact of  atmospheric air.    Though we have referred the palo de vaca to the family of the sapotas,  we have nevertheless found in it a great resemblance to some plants of  the urticeous kind, especially to the fig-tree, because of its  terminal stipulae in the shape of a horn; and to the brosimum, on  account of the structure of its fruit. M. Kunth would even have  preferred this last classification; if the description of the fruit,  made on the spot, and the nature of the milk, which is acrid in the  urticeae, and sweet in the sapotas, did not seem to confirm our  conjecture. Bredemeyer saw, like us, the fruit, and not the flower of  the cow tree. He asserts that he observed [sometimes?] two seeds,  lying one against the other, as in the alligator pear-tree (Laurus  persea). Perhaps this botanist had the intention of expressing the  same conformation of the nucleus that Swartz indicates in the  description of the brosimum--\"nucleus bilobus aut bipartibilis.\" We  have mentioned the places where this remarkable tree grows: it will be  easy for botanical travellers to procure the flower of the palo de  vaca and to remove the doubts which still remain, of the family to  which it belongs.)    Whilst the palo de vaca manifests the immense fecundity and the bounty  of nature in the torrid zone, it also reminds us of the numerous  causes which favour in those fine climates the careless indolence of  man. Mungo Park has made known the butter-tree of Bambarra, which M.  De Candolle suspects to be of the family of sapotas, as well as our  milk-tree. The plantain, the sago-tree, and the mauritia of the  Orinoco, are as much bread-trees as the rema of the South Sea. The  fruits of the crescentia and the lecythis serve as vessels for  containing food, while the spathes of the palms, and the bark of  trees, furnish caps and garments without a seam. The knots, or rather  the interior cells of the trunks of bamboos, supply ladders, and  facilitate in a thousand ways the construction of a hut, and the  fabrication of chairs, beds, and other articles of furniture that  compose the wealth of a savage household. In the midst of this lavish  vegetation, so varied in its productions, it requires very powerful  motives to excite man to labour, to rouse him from his lethargy, and  to unfold his intellectual faculties.    Cacao and cotton are cultivated at Barbula. We there found, what is  very rare in that country, two large cylindrical machines for  separating the cotton from its seed; one put in motion by an hydraulic  wheel, and the other by a wheel turned by mules. The overseer of the  farm, who had constructed these machines, was a native of Merida. He  was acquainted with the road that leads from Nueva Valencia, by the  way of Guanare and Misagual, to Varinas; and thence by the ravine of  Collejones, to the Paramo de Mucuchies and the mountains of Merida  covered with eternal snows. The notions he gave us of the time  requisite for going from Valencia by Varinas to the Sierra Nevada, and  thence by the port of Torunos, and the Rio Santo Domingo, to San  Fernando de Apure, were of infinite value to us. It can scarcely be  imagined in Europe, how difficult it is to obtain accurate information  in a country where the communications are so rare; and where distances  are diminished or exaggerated according to the desire that may be felt  to encourage the traveller, or to deter him from his purpose. I had  resolved to visit the eastern extremity of the Cordilleras of New  Grenada, where they lose themselves in the paramos of Timotes and  Niquitao. I learned at Barbula, that this excursion would retard our  arrival at the Orinoco thirty-five days. This delay appeared to us so  much the longer, as the rains were expected to begin sooner than  usual. We had the hope of examining afterwards a great number of  mountains covered with perpetual snow, at Quito, Peru, and Mexico; and  it appeared to me still more prudent to relinquish our project of  visiting the mountains of Merida, since by so doing we might miss the  real object of our journey, that of ascertaining by astronomical  observations the point of communication between the Orinoco, the Rio  Negro, and the river Amazon. We returned in consequence from Barbula  to Guacara, to take leave of the family of the Marquis del Toro, and  pass three days more on the borders of the lake.    It was the carnival season, and all was gaiety. The sports in which  the people indulge, and which are called carnes tollendas,* assume  occasionally somewhat of a savage character. (* Or \"farewell to  flesh.\" The word carnival has the same meaning, these sports being  always held just before the commencement of Lent.) Some led an ass  loaded with water, and, where-ever they found a window open, inundated  the apartment within by means of a pump. Others carried bags filled  with hairs of picapica;* (* Dolichos pruriens (cowage).) and blew the  hair, which causes a great irritation of the skin, into the faces of  those who passed by.    From Guacara we returned to Nueva Valencia. We found there a few  French emigrants, the only ones we saw during five years passed in the  Spanish colonies. Notwithstanding the ties of blood which unite the  royal families of France and Spain, even French priests were not  permitted to take refuge in that part of the New World, where man with  such facility finds food and shelter. Beyond the Atlantic, the United  States of America afford the only asylum to misfortune. A government,  strong because it is free, confiding because it is just, has nothing  to fear in giving refuge to the proscribed.    We have endeavoured above to give some notions of the state of the  cultivation of indigo, cotton, and sugar, in the province of Caracas.  Before we quit the valley of Aragua and its"]]]
