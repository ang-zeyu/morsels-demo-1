I wish that you would take this letter, Mr. Nye, and write something from  it in your own way, for publication, showing how we happened to have more  zeal than usual in the church last Sabbath, and that it was not directly  the result of the sermon which was preached on that day.    Yours, with great respect,    William Lemons.          The Weeping Woman.    I have not written much for publication lately, because I did not feel  well, I was fatigued. I took a ride on the cars last week and it shook me  up a good deal.    The train was crowded somewhat, and so I sat in a seat with a woman who  got aboard at Minkin's Siding. I noticed as we pulled out of Minkin's  Siding, that this woman raised the window so that she could bid adieu to a  man in a dyed moustache. I do not know whether he was her dolce far  niente, or her grandson by her second husband. I know that if he had been  a relative of mine, however, I would have cheerfully concealed the fact.    [Illustration: SHE SOBBED SEVERAL MORE TIMES.]    She waved a little 2x6 handkerchief out of the window, said \"good-bye,\"  allowed a fresh zephyr from Cape Sabine to come in and play a xylophone  interlude on my spinal column, and then burst into a paroxysm of damp, hot  tears.    I had to go into another car for a moment, and when I returned a pugilist  from Chicago had my seat. When I travel I am uniformly courteous,  especially to pugilists. A pugilist who has started out as an obscure boy  with no money, no friends, and no one to practice on, except his wife or  his mother, with no capital aside from his bare hands; a man who has had  to fight his way through life, as it were, and yet who has come out of  obscurity and attracted the attention of the authorities, and won the good  will of those with whom he came in contact, will always find me cordial  and pacific. So I allowed this self-made man with the broad, high,  intellectual shoulder blades, to sit in my seat with his feet on my new  and expensive traveling bag, while I sat with the tear-bedewed memento  from Minkin's Siding.    She sobbed several more times, then hove a sigh that rattled the windows  in the car, and sat up. I asked her if I might sit by her side for a few  miles and share her great sorrow. She looked at me askance. I did not  resent it. She allowed me to take the seat, and I looked at a paper for a  few moments so that she could look me over through the corners of her  eyes. I also scrutinized her lineaments some.    She was dressed up considerably, and, when a woman dresses up to ride in a  railway train, she advertises the fact that her intellect is beginning to  totter on its throne. People who have more than one suit of clothes should  not pick out the fine raiment for traveling purposes. This person was not  handsomely dressed, but she had the kind of clothes that look as though  they had tried to present the appearance of affluence and had failed to do  so.    This leads me to say, in all seriousness, that there is nothing so sad as  the sight of a man or woman who would scorn to tell a wrong story, but who  will persist in wearing bogus clothes and bogus jewelry that wouldn't fool  anybody.    My seat-mate wore a cloak that had started out to bamboozle the American  people with the idea that it was worth $100, but it wouldn't mislead  anyone who might be nearer than half a mile. I also discovered, that it  had an air about it that would indicate that she wore it while she cooked  the pancakes and fried the doughnuts. It hardly seems possible that she  would do this, but the garment, I say, had that air about it.    She seemed to want to converse after awhile, and she began on the subject  of literature, picking up a volume that had been left in her seat by the  train boy, entitled: \"Shadowed to Skowhegan and Back; or, The Child Fiend;  price $2,\" we drifted on pleasantly into the broad domain of letters.    Incidentally I asked her what authors she read mostly.    \"O, I don't remember the authors so much as I do the books,\" said she; \"I  am a great reader. If I should tell you how much I have read, you wouldn't  believe it.\"    I said I certainly would. I had frequently been called upon to believe  things that would make the ordinary rooster quail.    If she discovered the true inwardness of this Anglo-American \"Jewdesprit,\"  she refrained from saying anything about it.    \"I read a good deal,\" she continued, \"and it keeps me all strung up. I  weep, O so easily.\" Just then she lightly laid her hand on my arm, and I  could see that the tears were rising to her eyes. I felt like asking her  if she had ever tried running herself through a clothes wringer every  morning? I did feel that someone ought to chirk her up, so I asked her if  she remembered the advice of the editor who received a letter from a young  lady troubled the same way. She stated that she couldn't explain it, but  every little while, without any apparent cause, she would shed tears, and  the editor asked her why she didn't lock up the shed.    We conversed for a long time about literature, but every little while she  would get me into deep water by quoting some author or work that I had  never read. I never realized what a hopeless ignoramus I was till I heard  about the scores of books that had made her shed the scalding, and yet  that I had never, never read. When she looked at me with that far-away  expression in her eyes, and with her hand resting lightly on my arm in  such a way as to give the gorgeous two karat Rhinestone from Pittsburg  full play, and told me how such works as \"The New Made Grave; or The Twin  Murderers\" had cost her many and many a copious tear, I told her I was  glad of it. If it be a blessed boon for the student of such books to weep  at home and work up their honest perspiration into scalding tears, far be  it from me to grudge that poor boon.    I hope that all who may read these lines, and who may feel that the pores  of their skin are getting torpid and sluggish, owing to an inherited  antipathy toward physical exertion, and who feel that they would rather  work up their perspiration into woe and shed it in the shape of common  red-eyed weep, will keep themselves to this poor boon. People have  different ways of enjoying themselves, and I hope no one will hesitate  about accepting this or any other poor boon that I do not happen to be  using at the time.          The Crops.    I have just been through Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, on a tour of  inspection. I rode for over ten days in these States in a sleeping-car,  examining crops, so that I could write an intelligent report.    [Illustration]    Grain in Northern Wisconsin suffered severely in the latter part of the  season from rust, chintz bug, Hessian fly and trichina. In the St. Croix  valley wheat will not average a half crop. I do not know why farmers  should insist upon leaving their grain out nights in July, when they know  from the experience of former years that it will surely rust.    In Southern Wisconsin too much rain has almost destroyed many crops, and  cattle have been unable to get enough to eat, unless they were fed, for  several weeks. This is a sad outlook for the farmer at this season.    In the northern part of the State many fields of grain were not worth  cutting, while others barely yielded the seed, and even that of a very  inferior quality.    The ruta-baga is looking unusually well this fall, but we cannot subsist  entirely upon the ruta-baga. It is juicy and rich if eaten in large  quantities, but it is too bulky to be popular with the aristocracy.    Cabbages in most places are looking well, though in some quarters I notice  an epidemic of worms. To successfully raise the cabbage, it will be  necessary at all times to be well supplied with vermifuge that can be  readily administered at any hour of the day or night.    The crook-neck squash in the Northwest is a great success this season. And  what can be more beautiful, as it calmly lies in its bower of green vines  in the crisp and golden haze of autumn, than the cute little crook-neck  squash, with yellow, warty skin, all cuddled up together in the cool  morning, like the discarded wife of an old Mormon elder--his first attempt  in the matrimonial line, so to speak, ere he had gained wisdom by  experience.    The full-dress, low-neck-and-short-sleeve summer squash will be worn as  usual this fall, with trimmings of salt and pepper in front and revers of  butter down the back.    N.B.--It will not be used much as an outside wrap, but will be worn mostly  inside.    Hop-poles in some parts of Wisconsin are entirely killed. I suppose that  continued dry weather in the early summer did it.    Hop-lice, however, are looking well. Many of our best hop-breeders thought  that when the hop-pole began to wither and die, the hop-louse could not  survive the intense dry heat; but hop-lice have never looked better in  this State than they do this fall.    I can remember very well when Wisconsin had to send to Ohio for hop-lice.  Now she could almost supply Ohio and still have enough to fill her own  coffers.    [Illustration: ENJOYING HIMSELF AT THE DANCE.]    I do not know that hop-lice are kept in coffers, and I may be wrong in  speaking thus freely of these two subjects, never having seen either a  hop-louse or a coffer, but I feel that the public must certainly and  naturally expect me to say something on these subjects. Fruit in the  Northwest this season is not a great success. Aside from the cranberry and  choke-cherry, the fruit yield in the northern district is light. The early  dwarf crab, with or without, worms, as desired--but mostly with--is  unusually poor this fall.

Three more, friends,\"  and he raised his head as if he could see his companions. After a  few minutes he heard two more falls.    \"Six, seven--well, only seven,\" he said, as he began searching for  the cocoanuts on the ground. \"One more for me, friends--one more,  and every one is satisfied.\" But it was his friends who had fallen;  for, as the trees were only stumps, the climbers fell off when they  reached the tops.    Juan, however, did not guess what had happened until he found one  of the dead bodies. Then he ran away as fast as he could. At last he  struck Justo, a lame man. After hearing Juan's story, Justo advised  Juan not to return to his village, lest he be accused of murder by  the relatives of the other men.    After a long talk, the two agreed to travel together and seek a  place of refuge, for the blind man's proposal seemed a good one to  the lame man:--              \"Blind man, strong legs;          Lame man, good eyes;          Four-footed are pigs;          Four-handed are monkeys.          But we'll walk on two,          And we'll see with two.\"      So when morning dawned, they started on their journey.    They had not travelled far when Justo saw a horn in the road, and  told Juan about it. Juan said,--              \"Believe me, that everything          Which man can use he must bring,          No matter at all of what it's made;          So, friend, a horn too we need.\"      The next thing that Justo saw was a rusted axe; and after being told  about it, Juan repeated his little verse again, ending it with, \"So,  friend, an axe too we need.\" A few hours later the lame man saw a  piece of rope; and when the blind man knew of it, he said,--              \"Bring one, bring two, bring all,          The horn, the axe, the rope as well.\"      And last of all they found an old drum, which they took along with  them too.    Soon Justo saw a very big house. They were glad, for they thought  that they could get something to eat there. When they came near it,  they found that the door was open; but when they entered it, Justo  saw nothing but bolos, spears, and shields hanging on the walls. After  a warm discussion as to what they should do, they decided to hide in  the ceiling of the house, and remain there until the owner returned.    They had no sooner made themselves comfortable than they heard some  persons coming. When Justo saw the bloody bolos and spears of the  men, and the big sack of money they carried, he was terrified, for he  suspected that they were outlaws. He trembled; his hair stood on end;  he could not control himself. At last he shouted, \"Ay, here?\"    The blind man, who could not see the danger they were in, stopped  the lame man, but not before the owners of the house had heard them.    \"Ho, you mosquitoes! what are you doing there?\" asked the chief of  the outlaws as he looked up at the ceiling.    \"Aha, you rascals! we are going to eat you all,\" answered the blind  man in the loudest voice he could muster.    \"What's that you say?\" returned the chief.    \"Why, we have been looking for you, for we intend to eat you all up,\"  replied Juan; \"and to show you what kind of animals we are, here is  one of my teeth,\" and Juan threw down the rusted axe. \"Look at one  of my hairs!\" continued Juan, as he threw down the rope.    The outlaws were so frightened that they were almost ready to run  away. The chief could not say a single word.    \"Now listen, you ants, to my whistle!\" said Juan, and he blew  the horn. \"And to show you how big our stomachs are, hear us beat  them!\" and he beat the drum. The outlaws were so frightened that they  ran away. Some of them even jumped out of the windows.    When the robbers were all gone, Juan and Justo went down to divide  the money; but the lame man tried to cheat the blind man, and they  had a quarrel over the division. Justo struck Juan in the eyes with  the palm of his hand, and the blind man's eyes were opened so that he  could see. Juan kicked Justo so hard, that the lame man rolled toward  one corner of the house and struck a post. His lameness was cured,  so that he could stand and walk.    When they saw that each had done the other a great service, they  divided the money fairly, and lived ever after together as close  friends.      Teofilo the Hunchback, and the Giant.    Narrated by Loreta Benavides, a Bicol student, who heard the story  from her aunt.    Once there lived a hunchback whose name was Teofilo. He was an  orphan, and used to get his food by wandering through the woods. He  had no fixed home. Sometimes he even slept under large trees in the  forest. His one blind eye, as well as his crooked body, would make  almost any one pity his miserable condition.    One day, while he was wandering through the woods looking for something  to eat, he found a piece of large rope. He was very glad; for he  could sell the rope, and in that way get money to buy food. Walking  a little farther, he found a gun leaning against a fence. This gun,  he supposed, had been left there by a hunter. He was glad to have  it, too, for protection. Finally, while crossing a swampy place,  he saw a duck drinking in the brook. He ran after the duck, and at  last succeeded in catching it. Now he was sure of a good meal.    But it had taken him a long time to capture the duck. Night soon came  on, and he had to look for a resting-place. Fortunately he came to a  field, and his eye caught a glimpse of light on the other side. He went  towards the light, and found it to come from a house, all the windows  of which were open. He knocked at the door, but nobody answered;  so he just pushed it open and entered. He then began to feel very  comfortable. He prepared his bed, and then went to sleep. He did not  know that he was in a giant's house.    At midnight Teofilo was awakened by a loud voice. He made a hole in  the wall and looked out. There in the dark he saw a very tall man,  taller even than the house itself. It was the giant. The giant said,  \"I smell some one here.\" He tried to open the door, but Teofilo had  locked it.    \"If you are really a strong man and braver than I,\" said the giant,  \"let me see your hair!\"    Teofilo then threw out the piece of rope. The giant was surprised at  its size. He then asked to see Teofilo's louse, and Teofilo threw  out the duck. The giant was terrified, for he had never seen such  a large louse before. Finally the giant said, \"Well, you seem to be  larger than I. Let me hear your voice!\"    Teofilo fired his gun. When the giant heard the gun and saw it  spitting fire, he trembled, for he thought that the man's saliva  was burning coals. Afraid to challenge his strange guest any more,  the giant ran away and disappeared forever.    And so Teofilo the hunchback lived happily all the rest of his days  in the giant's house without being troubled by any one.      Juan and the Buringcantada.    Narrated by Pacifico Buenconsejo, a Bicol, who heard the story from  his grandmother.    A long time ago, when the Bicols had not yet been welded into one  tribe, there lived a couple in the mountains of Albay who had one son,  named Juan. Before the boy was five years old, his father died. As  Juan grew up, he became very lazy: he did not like to work, nor would  he help his mother earn their daily bread. Despite his laziness,  Juan was dearly loved by his mother. She did not want him to work  in the field under the hot sun. Because of his mother's indulgence,  he grew lazier and lazier.    Every afternoon Juan used to take a walk while his mother was  working. She was a kind-hearted woman, and often told her son to help  anybody he met that needed help. One afternoon, while he was walking  in a field, he saw two carabaos fighting. One was gored by the other,  and was about to die. Juan, mindful of what his mother told him,  went between the two animals to help the wounded one. Suddenly the  two animals gored him in the back, and he fell to the ground. A man,  passing by, found him, and took him to his home. When Juan's mother  learned why her son had been gored, she was greatly distressed that  her son was so foolish.    Juan soon recovered, and one day he invited his mother to go with  him to look for money. He insisted so hard, that finally she agreed  to accompany him. On their way they found an axe, which Juan picked  up and took along with him. They had not gone much farther, when  they saw a long rope stretching across the road. Juan's mother did  not want him to take it, but he said that it would be of some use to  them later. By and by they came to a river, on the bank of which they  found a large drum. Juan took this with him, too.    When they had been travelling about a week, they came upon a big  house. Juan said that he wanted to go see what was in the house, but  his mother told him that he should not go. However, he kept urging and  urging, until at last his mother consented, and went with him. When  they reached the hall, they found it well decorated with flowers and  leaves. They visited all the apartments of the house; and when they  came to the dining-room, they saw a large hole in the ceiling. Juan  told his mother that they had better hide in the ceiling until they  found out who the owner of the house was. The mother thought that  the plan was a wise one; so they went to the ceiling, taking with  them the axe, the rope, and the drum.    They had not been hiding many minutes, when the Buringcantada, a  giant with"]]]
