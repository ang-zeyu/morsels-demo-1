A temple  was erected in the middle of this terrace, with a dome about fifty  cubits high, which might be seen for several leagues round. It was  thirty cubits long, and twenty broad, built of red marble, highly  polished. The inside of the dome was adorned with three rows of fine  paintings, in good taste: and there was not a place in the whole  temple but was embellished with paintings, bas-reliefs, and figures  of idols from top to bottom.    Every night and morning there were ceremonies performed in this  temple, which were always succeeded by sports, concerts, dancing,  singing, and feasts. The ministers of the temple and the inhabitants  of the place had nothing to live on but the offerings of pilgrims,  who came in crowds from the most distant parts of the kingdom to  perform their vows.    Prince Houssain was also spectator of a solemn feast, which was  celebrated every year at the court of Bisnagar, at which all the  governors of provinces, commanders of fortified places, all the  governors and judges of towns, and the Brahmins most celebrated for  their learning, were obliged to be present; and some lived so far  off that they were four months in coming. This assembly, composed of  innumerable multitudes of Indians, met in a plain of vast extent, as  far as the eye could reach. In the centre of this plain was a square  of great length and breadth, closed on one side by a large  scaffolding of nine stories, supported by forty pillars, raised for  the king and his court, and those strangers whom he admitted to  audience once a week. Inside, it was adorned and furnished  magnificently; and on the outside were painted fine landscapes,  wherein all sorts of beasts, birds, and insects, even flies and  gnats, were drawn as naturally as possible. Other scaffolds of at  least four or five stories, and painted almost all alike, formed the  other three sides.    On each side of the square, at some little distance from each other,  were ranged a thousand elephants, sumptuously harnessed, each having  upon his back a square wooden castle, finely gilt, in which were  musicians and actors. The trunks, ears, and bodies of these  elephants were painted with cinnabar and other colours, representing  grotesque figures.    But what Prince Houssain most of all admired was to see the largest  of these elephants stand with his four feet on a post fixed into  the earth, two feet high, playing and beating time with his trunk  to the music. Besides this, he admired another elephant as big,  standing on a board, which was laid across a strong beam about ten  feet high, with a great weight at the other end which balanced him,  while he kept time with the music by the motions of his body and  trunk.    Prince Houssain might have made a longer stay in the kingdom and  court of Bisnagar, where he would have seen other wonders, till the  last day of the year, whereon he and his brothers had appointed to  meet. But he was so well satisfied with what he had seen, and his  thoughts ran so much upon the Princess Nouronnihar, that he fancied  he should be the more easy and happy the nearer he was to her.  After he had paid the master of the khan for his apartment, and  told him the hour when he might come for the key, without telling  him how he should go, he shut the door, put the key on the outside,  and spreading the carpet, he and the officer he had brought with  him sat down on it, and, as soon as he had wished, were transported  to the inn at which he and his brothers were to meet, where he  passed for a merchant till they came.    Prince Ali, the second brother, travelled into Persia with a  caravan, and after four months' travelling arrived at Schiraz,  which was then the capital of the kingdom of Persia, and having on  the way made friends with some merchants, passed for a jeweller,  and lodged in the same khan with them.    The next morning, while the merchants were opening their bales of  merchandise, Prince Ali took a walk into that quarter of the town  where they sold precious stones, gold and silver work, brocades,  silks, fine linens, and other choice and valuable merchandise,  which was at Schiraz called the bezestein. It was a spacious and  well-built place, arched over, and supported by large pillars;  along the walls, within and without, were shops. Prince Ali soon  rambled through the bezestein, and with admiration judged of the  riches of the place by the prodigious quantities of most precious  merchandise there exposed to view.    But among all the criers who passed backwards and forwards with  several sorts of things to sell, he was not a little surprised to  see one who held in his hand an ivory tube about a foot in length  and about an inch thick, and cried it at thirty purses. At first he  thought the crier mad, and to make sure, went to a shop, and said  to the merchant, who stood at the door, 'Pray, sir, is not that man  mad? If he is not, I am very much deceived.'    'Indeed, sir,' answered the merchant, 'he was in his right senses  yesterday, and I can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we  have, and the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be  sold; and if he cries the ivory tube at thirty purses, it must be  worth as much, or more, for some reason or other which does not  appear. He will come by presently, and we will call him; in the  meantime sit down on my sofa and rest yourself.'    Prince Ali accepted the merchant's obliging offer, and presently  the crier passed by. The merchant called him by his name; and  pointing to the prince, said to him, 'Tell that gentleman, who  asked me if you were in your right senses, what you mean by crying  that ivory tube, which seems not to be worth much, at thirty  purses: I should be very much amazed myself, if I did not know you  were a sensible man.'    The crier, addressing himself to Prince Ali, said, 'Sir, you are  not the only person that takes me for a madman on account of this  tube; you shall judge yourself whether I am or no, when I have told  you its peculiarity. First, sir,' pursued the crier, presenting the  ivory tube to the prince, 'observe that this tube is furnished with  a glass at both ends; by looking through one of them you see  whatever object you wish to behold.'    'I am,' said the prince, 'ready to make you all proper reparation  for the scandal I have thrown on you, if you will make the truth of  what you say appear'; and as he had the ivory tube in his hand, he  said, 'Show me at which of these ends I must look.' The crier  showed him, and he looked through, wishing at the same time to see  the sultan, his father. He immediately beheld him in perfect  health, sitting on his throne, in the midst of his council.  Afterwards, as there was nothing in the world so dear to him, after  the sultan, as the Princess Nouronnihar, he wished to see her, and  saw her laughing, and in a pleasant humour, with her women about  her.    Prince Ali needed no other proof to persuade him that this tube was  the most valuable thing, not only in the city of Schiraz, but in  all the world; and he believed that, if he should neglect it, he  would never meet again with such another rarity. He said to the  crier, 'I am very sorry that I should have entertained so bad an  opinion of you, but hope to make you amends by buying the tube, so  tell me the lowest price the seller has fixed upon it. Come with  me, and I will pay you the money.' The crier assured him that his  last orders were to take no less than forty purses; and, if he  disputed the truth of what he said, he would take him to his  employer. The prince believed him, took him to the khan where he  lodged, counted out the money, and received the tube.    Prince Ali was overjoyed at his bargain; and persuaded himself  that, as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so  rare and marvellous, the Princess Nouronnihar would be his wife. He  thought now of visiting the court of Persia incognito, and seeing  whatever was curious in and about Schiraz, till the caravan with  which he came returned back to the Indies. When the caravan was  ready to set out, the prince joined them, and arrived without any  accident or trouble at the place of rendezvous, where he found  Prince Houssain, and both waited for Prince Ahmed.    Prince Ahmed took the road to Samarcand; and the day after his  arrival there went, as his brothers had done, into the bezestein.  He had not walked long before he heard a crier, who had an  artificial apple in his hand, cry it at five-and-thirty purses. He  stopped the crier, and said to him, 'Let me see that apple, and  tell me what virtue or extraordinary property it has, to be valued  at so high a rate.'    'Sir,' said the crier, putting it into his hand, 'if you look at  the outside of this apple, it is very ordinary; but if you consider  the great use and benefit it is to mankind, you will say it is  invaluable. He who possesses it is master of a great treasure. It  cures all sick persons of the most mortal diseases, fever,  pleurisy, plague, or other malignant distempers; and, if the  patient is dying, it will immediately restore him to perfect  health; and this is done after the easiest manner in the world,  merely by the patient smelling the apple.'    'If one may believe you,' replied Prince Ahmed, 'the virtues of  this apple are wonderful, and it is indeed valuable: but what  ground has a plain man like myself, who may wish to become the  purchaser, to be persuaded that there is no deception or  exaggeration in the high praise you bestow on it?'    'Sir,' replied the crier, 'the thing is known and averred by the  whole city of Samarcand; but, without going any further, ask all  these merchants you see here, and hear what they say; several of  them would not have been alive this day if they had not made use of  this excellent remedy. It is the result of the study and experience"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#14)"],[1,"rs, they may be so again with  profit in this connection, for never were the heroism of a true Woman,  and the purity of love in a true marriage, painted in colors more  delicate and more lively.    \"The chariot of Abradatus, that had four perches and eight horses, was  completely adorned for him; and when he was going to put on his linen  corslet, which was a sort of armor used by those of his country,  Panthea brought him a golden helmet, and arm-pieces, broad bracelets  for his wrists, a purple habit that reached down to his feet, and  hung in folds at the bottom, and a crest dyed of a violet color. These  things she had made, unknown to her husband, and by taking the measure  of his armor. He wondered when he saw them, and inquired thus of  Panthea: 'And have you made me these arms, woman, by destroying your  own ornaments?' 'No, by Jove!' said Panthea, 'not what is the most  valuable of them; for it is you, if you appear to others to be what I  think you, that will be my greatest ornament.' And, saying that, she  put on him the armor, and, though she endeavored to conceal it, the  tears poured down her checks. When Abradatus, who was before a man of  fine appearance, was set out in those arms, he appeared the most  beautiful and noble of all, especially being likewise so by nature.  Then, taking the reins from the driver, he was just preparing to mount  the chariot, when Panthea, after she had desired all that were there  to retire, thus said:    \"'O Abradatus! if ever there was a woman who had a greater regard to  her husband than to her own soul, I believe you know that I am such an  one; what need I therefore speak of things in particular? for I reckon  that my actions have convinced you more than any words I can now use.  And yet, though I stand thus affected toward you, as you know I do, I  swear, by this friendship of mine and yours, that I certainly would  rather choose to be put under ground jointly with you, approving  yourself a brave man, than to live with you in disgrace and shame; so  much do I think you and myself worthy of the noblest things. Then I  think that we both lie under great obligations to Cyrus, that, when I  was a captive, and chosen out for himself, he thought fit to treat me  neither as a slave, nor, indeed, as a woman of mean account, but he  took and kept me for you, as if I were his brother's wife. Besides,  when Araspes, who was my guard, went away from him, I promised him,  that, if he would allow me to send for you, you would come to him, and  approve yourself a much better and move faithful friend than Araspes.'    \"Thus she spoke; and Abradatus, being struck with admiration at her  discourse, laying, his hand gently on her head, and lifting up his  eyes to heaven, made this prayer: 'Do thou, O greatest Jove! I grant  me to appear a husband worthy of Panthea, and a friend worthy of  Cyrus, who has done us so much honor!'    \"Having said this, he mounted the chariot by the door of the driver's  seat; and, after he had got up, when the driver shut the door,  Panthea, who had now no other way to salute him, kissed the seat of  the chariot. The chariot then moved, and she, unknown to him,  followed, till Abradatus turning about, and seeing her, said: 'Take  courage, Panthea! Fare you happily and well, and now go your ways.' On  this her women and servants carried her to her conveyance, and, laying  her down, concealed her by throwing the covering of a tent over her.  The people, though Abradatus and his chariot made a noble spectacle,  were not able to look at him till Panthea was gone.\"    After the battle--    \"Cyrus calling to some of his servants, 'Tell me, said he, 'has any  one seen Abradatus? for I admire that he now does not appear.' One  replied, 'My sovereign, it is because he is not living, but died in  the battle as he broke in with his chariot on the Egyptians. All the  rest, except his particular companions, they say, turned off when they  saw the Egyptians' compact body. His wife is now said to have taken up  his dead body, to have placed it in the carriage that she herself was  conveyed in, and to have brought it hither to some place on the river  Pactolus, and her servants are digging a grave on a certain elevation.  They say that his wife, after setting him out with all the ornaments  she has, is sitting on the ground with his head on her knees.' Cyrus,  hearing this, gave himself a blow on the thigh, mounted his horse at a  leap, and, taking with him a thousand horse, rode away to this scene  of affliction; but gave orders to Gadatas and Gobryas to take with  them all the rich ornaments proper for a friend and an excellent man  deceased, and to follow after him; and whoever had herds of cattle  with him, he ordered them to take both oxen, and horses, and sheep in  good number, and to bring them away to the place where, by inquiry,  they should find him to be, that he might sacrifice these to  Abradatus.    \"As soon as he saw the woman sitting on the ground, and the dead body  there lying, he shed tears at the afflicting sight, and said: 'Alas!  thou brave and faithful soul, hast thou left us, and art thou gone?'  At the same time he took him by the right hand, and the hand of the  deceased came away, for it had been cut off with a sword by the  Egyptians.   He, at the sight of this, became yet much more concerned  than before.    The woman shrieked out in a lamentable manner, and,  taking the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, fitted it to its proper place  again, as well as she could, and said: 'The rest, Cyrus, is in the  same condition, but what need you see it? And I know that I was not  one of the least concerned in these his sufferings, and, perhaps, you  were not less so; for I, fool that I was! frequently exhorted him to  behave in such a manner as to appear a friend to you, worthy of  notice; and I know he never thought of what he himself should suffer,  but of what he should do to please you. He is dead, therefore,' said  she, 'without reproach, and I, who urged him on, sit here alive.'  Cyrus, shedding tears for some time in silence, then spoke:--'He has  died, woman, the noblest death; for he has died victorious! Do you  adorn him with these things that I furnish you with.'   (Gobryas and  Gadatas were then come up, and had brought rich ornaments in great  abundance with them.)   'Then,' said he, 'be assured that he shall not  want respect and honor in all other things; but, over and above,  multitudes shall concur in raising him a monument that shall be worthy  of us, and all the sacrifices shall be made him that are proper to be  made in honor of a brave man.   You shall not be left destitute, but,  for the sake of your modesty and every other virtue, I will pay you  all other honors, as well as place those about you who will conduct  you wherever you please. Do you but make it known to me where it is  that you desire to be conveyed to.' And Panthea replied: 'Be  confident, Cyrus, I will not conceal from you to whom it is that I  desire to go.'    \"He, having said this, went away with great pity for her that she  should have lost such a husband, and for the man that he should have  left such a wife behind him, never to see her more. Panthea then gave  orders for her servants to retire, 'till such time,' said she, 'as I  shall have lamented my husband as I please.' Her nurse she bid to  stay, and gave orders that, when she was dead, she would wrap her and  her husband up in one mantle together. The nurse, after having  repeatedly begged her not to do this, and meeting with no success, but  observing her to grow angry, sat herself down, breaking out into  tears. She, being beforehand provided with a sword, killed herself,  and, laying her head down on her husband's breast, she died. The nurse  set up a lamentable cry, and covered them both, as Panthea had  directed.    \"Cyrus, as soon as he was informed of what the woman had done, being  struck with it, went to help her if he could. The servants, three in  number, seeing what had been done, drew their swords and killed  themselves, as they stood at the place where she bad ordered them. And  the monument is now said to have been raised by continuing the mound  on to the servants; and on a pillar above, they say, the names of the  man and woman were written in Syriac letters.    \"Below were three pillars, and they were inscribed thus, 'Of the  servants.' Cyrus, when he came to this melancholy scene, was struck  with admiration of the woman, and, having lamented over her, went  away. He took care, as was proper, that all the funeral rites should  be paid them in the noblest manner, and the monument, they say, was  raised up to a very great size.\"         *       *       *       *       *    These be the ancients, who, so many assert, had no idea of the dignity  of Woman, or of marriage. Such love Xenophon could paint as subsisting  between those who after death \"would see one another never more.\"  Thousands of years have passed since, and with the reception of the  Cross, the nations assume the belief that those who part thus may meet  again and forever, if spiritually fitted to one another, as Abradatus  and Panthea were, and yet do we see such marriages among them? If at  all, how often?    I must quote two more short passages from Xenophon, for he is a writer  who pleases me well.    Cyrus, receiving the Armenians whom he had conquered--    \"'Tigranes,' said he, 'at what rate would you purchase the regaining  of your wife?' Now Tigranes happened to be _but lately married_,  and had a very great love for his wife.\" (That clause perhaps sounds  _modern_.)    \"'Cyrus,' said he, 'I would ransom her at the expense of my life.'    \"'Take then your own to yourself,' said he. ...    \"When they came home, one talked of Cyrus' wisdom, another of his  patience and resolution, another of his mildness. One spoke of his  beauty and smallness of his person, and, on that, Tigranes asked his  wife, 'And do you,"]]]
