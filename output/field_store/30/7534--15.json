Cruel sentence, the definite meaning of which was  like a summons to me,--death beckoning me from the shadows of the  future. Before my imagination a thousand Christmas Eves filed by,  a thousand hearths were extinguished, a thousand families that had  supped together ceased to exist,--other children, other joys, other  songs, lost forever; the loves of my grandparents, their antiquated  mode of dress, their remote youth, the memories thereof that crowded  upon them; my parents' childhood, the first Christmas celebration  in our home, all the happiness that had preceded me! Then I could  imagine, I could foresee, a thousand more Christmas Eves recurring  periodically and robbing us of our life and hope,--future joys in  which we should not all take part together, my brothers scattered  over the earth, my parents naturally dying before us, the twentieth  century following upon the nineteenth! The live coals turned to  ashes,--my vanished youth, my old age, my grave, my posthumous  memory, then the complete oblivion of me, the indifference, the  ingratitude of my grandchildren, living of my blood, and who would  laugh and enjoy while the worms profaned the skull in which these  very thoughts were now conceived.    The tears gushed from my eyes. I was asked why I was crying, and as  I did not know or at least could not have defined the reason even to  myself, my father concluded that I was sleepy, and I was accordingly  sent to bed. Here was another motive for weeping, and so it happened  that my first philosophical tears and my last childish ones were  mingled. That night of insomnia which I spent listening to the joyous  sounds of a celebration from which I had been excluded for being too  much of a child, as my parents believed then,--or too much of a man,  as I realize now,--was perhaps the bitterest of my life.    I must have fallen asleep at last, however, for I cannot remember  whether the projects of going to midnight Mass, the Nativity play,  and making sherbet out of the snow in the court fell through or not.      III.    Where is my childhood?    I feel as though I had just been relating a dream.    The world is wide, after all! My paternal grandmother, the one  who sang the couplet, died a long time ago. On the other hand, my  brothers have married and have children. My father's harp, unstrung  and broken, has been thrown among the cast-off furniture. It has  been many a Christmas Eve since I had supper at home. My village  has disappeared from the ocean of my life like the islet which the  mariner leaves behind him.    I am no longer the same Pedro, the child, that focus of ignorance,  curiosity, and anguish trembling on the threshold of life. I am  nothing short of a man, an inhabitant of Madrid, comfortably settled  in life, proud of my independence as a bachelor, a novelist, and  a volunteer in the great orphanage of the capital, with whiskers,  debts, and loves.    When I compare myself now, my perfect freedom, my broad life, the  immense scene of my operations, my early experience, standing as I do  revealed, tuned like a grand piano on the night of a concert; when I  compare myself with all my boldness, my ambitions, my contempts, with  the little chap that played the drum fifteen years ago on Christmas  Eve in a remote corner of Andalusia,--I smile, I even laugh aloud,  with the feeling that it befits me, while my lonely heart sheds pure  tears of infinite melancholy, which it carefully hides from view.  Holy tears! May Providence frank you to the home where my father is  growing old!      IV.    Well, what shall it be?--for, as the boys sing in the streets,--        \"Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve!      This is surely no night for sleep!\"    Where shall I spend the evening? Fortunately I can choose; let me see.    This is the 24th of December, 1855. We are in Madrid. We know the  waiters of all the cafés by name. We are hand in glove with the most  applauded poets of the day, the demi-gods of provincial amateurs.  We frequent theatres and see plays from the inside, as it were.  The great actors and singers shake our hand behind the scenes. We  penetrate into the editor's rooms and are initiated in the alchemy  which produces newspapers. We have seen the type-setter's fingers  stained with the lead of words, and the fingers of the author stained  with the ink of thoughts. We have free access to one of the tribunes  of Congress, credit at the hotels; there are social gatherings that  appreciate us, and tailors that endure us.    We are happy! Our youthful ambition is satisfied. We can enjoy  this night. We have conquered the world. Madrid is ours. Madrid is  our home. A cheer for Madrid! And you, provincial youths, who at  nightfall on an autumn day, sad and lonely, unearth and air your  impotent longing for the capital,--you who feel yourselves to be  poets, musicians, painters, orators, who despise your village, who  will not speak to your parents, who weep with ambition and dream of  suicide,--burst with envy, all of you, as we are now bursting with  pleasure.      V.    Two hours have passed. It is nine o'clock. I have money; where shall  I take supper? My friends, more fortunate than I, will smother their  loneliness in the clamor of an orgy. \"Night is of wine,\" they said to  me only a few moments ago; but I would not be of them. It has been  some time now since I crossed this red sea of youth dry-footed.    \"Night is of tears,\" I said to them.    Those who compose our social gatherings are at the theatre. The  people of Madrid celebrate the Nativity of our Lord by listening to  the ranting of actors.    A few homes in which I am almost a stranger have offered me alms  out of their domestic warmth in the form of an invitation to  dinner,--for the old-fashioned supper has gone out of style. But I  would not accept. That is not what I want. What I long for is the  Paschal feast, the Christmas Eve supper, my home, my relatives, my  traditions, my memories, the former joys of my soul, the religion  that was taught me when I was a child.      VI.    Ah, Madrid is an inn. On a night like this we come to know what  Madrid is. Our capital is a floating population, heterogeneous,  exotic, which can only be compared to the population of a free port,  of a jail, of an insane asylum. Travellers journeying toward a  future, to the fantastic kingdom of ambition, halt here as well as  those who are journeying back from misery, from crime.    Beauty comes here to marry, or to sell herself, the landed proprietor  to squander his wealth, the literati for glory, the deputy to become  a minister, the worthless man for a government office. The savant,  the inventor, the comedian, the giant, the dwarf, the man with an  anomaly in his soul or in his body, the monster with seven arms  and three noses as well as the philosopher with double sight, the  charlatan, the reformer, the man who creates melodies, and the man  who counterfeits bank-notes,--all spend some period of their life  in the great inn. Those who attain notoriety, those who find a  purchaser, those who have grown rich at the expense of themselves,  become in time the innkeepers, the landlords, the masters of Madrid,  and forget the land of their birth. But we, the wayfarers, the  lodgers,--we realize to-night that Madrid means exile, that Madrid is  a bivouac, a prison, a purgatory. For the first time in the year we  feel that neither the café, the theatre, the casino, nor the hotel is  our house. More than that, we realize that our house is not our home.      VII.    The home--that sacred abode of the patriarch, of the Roman citizen,  of the feudal lord, of the very Arab; the holy arch of the Penates,  temple of hospitality, and altar of the family--has completely  disappeared in our great modern centres. The home survives in  the provinces alone. There our house is our own. In Madrid it is  generally the landlord's. In the provinces our house shelters us  for twenty, thirty, forty years at least. In Madrid one moves every  month, or at least every year. Our home has a physiognomy of its  own, which never varies, ever kindly and sympathetic. It grows  old with us; it bears the impress of our lives; it preserves our  footprints. In Madrid the exterior changes every leap year; the  apartments are arrayed in new garments; that furniture is sold which  our contact had consecrated. At home the whole edifice is ours: the  grassy court, the poultry-yard filled with chickens, the high, cheery  terraces, the deep well,--the children's terror,--the monumental  tower, the broad cool, vine-covered summer-house. Here we occupy  a half-flat, paper-lined, and divided into mean apartments, with  no view of the sky, no sun, no air. There we have that neighborly  affection, something between friendship and relationship, which binds  together all the families of one street. Here the man who moves about  noisily above our heads is unknown to us, neither do we know the man  who dies beyond the partition of our alcove, and whose death-rattle  disturbs our sleep. Our provincial home is a cluster of memories, of  local attachments: here the room in which we were born, there the  room where our brother died; here the empty hall in which we played  as children, there the study in which we wrote our first verses.

Vol. 1 (of 3) (#14)"],[1,"anything of her; I cannot bear to  lose sight of her so completely.\" I promised very readily to do as she  desired, though I warned her it might be months before I would get any  reply, as my sister was but a careless correspondent.    \"Thanks, and I will not interrupt you any more.\"    \"You do not interrupt me in the least, I assure you; but if you are  determined to go, perhaps you will sing. I see Colonel Vernon shutting  his writing desk.\"    \"With pleasure; would you like an Irish melody?\"    \"Beyond every thing.\"    And the next minute her rich voice was pouring forth in a full tide of  sweetness, \"Has sorrow thy young days shaded?\"    I soon dropped my pencil, and even after the last notes had died away,  remained listening for their renewal; then collecting my drawing  materials, I rose, and promising Miss Vernon to finish the sketch from  memory, I invited the Colonel to accompany me on a visit of ceremony  to Mrs. Winter; it was succeeded by another peep at the studio, a walk  with the Colonel, and then came the pleasant friendly dinner, the  frank cheerful interchange of thought, the after-dinner cup of coffee  and stroll in the pleasure ground to look at the moon reflected in  the river; while Miss Vernon, courteously anxious to give me what she  prized herself, gathered a bouquet of her choicest autumnal flowers,  \"to make me forget that horrid Carrington, at least in my own room,\"  she said; her grandfather laughing at the idea of her expecting I  should care for such things.    How delightfully homelike it all was.    Finally she sang me the serenade that had so enchanted me, and before  the last notes were well hushed, Nurse announced the cab I had ordered  to convey me to the railway.    I rose reluctantly, the Colonel, Nurse, and Cormac, and even Kate,  coming out in the fresh night air, all perfumed with the clematis and  heliotropes that adorned the front of the cottage, to see me off.    \"Good bye, Captain Egerton,\" said Kate,-- \"be sure to come back soon,  and do not forget the drawings; have you got your flowers?\"    \"It would be a bold man that would attempt to take them from me, Miss  Vernon; good night!\"    \"A thousand thanks, Colonel, for my very pleasant visit to A----.\"    \"God bless you, take care of yourself,\" he replied.    \"A' then the saints go wid ye!\" said Nurse.    \"Good bye, Mrs. O'Toole; I'll never taste an eatable trout, until I  return.\"    \"Good night once more;\" and I threw myself into the cab, with a feeling  of extraordinary regret, and affection for the old Colonel; for Mrs.  O'Toole, aye, even for Cormac; but for Kate--_Caramba_, as Winter would  say.    A short hour of hissing and clattering, and I was back again amongst  the bustling, crowded, glaring, gas exhaling streets of Carrington;  amidst the confusion of noisy omnibuses and uncouth cries, of drunken  mechanics, and wretched beggar women with their imps of children!    It was after ten o'clock before I entered the mess room to report my  return, (having first placed my precious flowers in safety). I found  the apartment redolent of the savoury odours of dinner and cigars,  and occupied by a larger party than usual; all of whom were in loud  and eager debate on the respective merits of the favourites for the  approaching Doncaster meeting. As soon as they perceived me through the  cloudy atmosphere, I was greeted with a perfect hurricane of queries,  exclamations, and offers of fifty and a hundred to one, against divers  and sundry horses, colts, and fillies.    \"Where, in the name of mystery, have you been skulking?\"    \"Hullo! Egerton, you're the very man I wanted; give me the long odds  against M----'s mare; you're sure to win, and it will just square my  book.\"    \"I say, Fred, I've backed 'Tearaway,' would you have me hedge off?\"    \"What has become of you; you have missed such a spread at the Mayor's,  and such speeches as would have driven Murray to suicide.\"    \"A hundred to five you don't name the winner.\"    \"Ha! Egerton, just come back?\"    \"Keep cool, my dear fellows, and give me some claret.\"    I sat down, endeavouring in vain to enter clearly into the several  subjects they were so eagerly discussing, and perfectly bewildered  by the strong contrast the whole scene presented to my life for the  last few days. Then followed long weary debates on the coming event,  interspersed with anecdotes of the villainy of certain trainers and  the intense knowingness of the jockies. Finally, I began to take  some interest in the details; the result partly of habit, and partly  of an effort to do so, lest any appearance of pre-occupation might  set my brother officers on the scent to discover its course. I was  successful--for Sedley exclaimed, \"I never saw Egerton return from one  of his philosophic expeditions with his wits so much about him.\"    \"By the way, you've been over to that tumble down old place A----; is  it worth seeing?\" said another.    \"Yes, to a lover of the picturesque and antique, but it has nothing  else to attract.\"    \"Ah! that will do; I do not care for the picturesque.\"    \"Were you successful in your search?\" asked Burton imprudently.    \"For what?\" called out half a dozen.    \"For the picturesque, of course,\" he replied. I breathed again.    \"Yes, particularly successful.\" He smiled, and shrinking from the  thought of my companions getting the slightest clue to his real  meaning, especially in their present mood, I rose and bid them all  good-night, having endured their Babel for more than two hours.    \"And you will not sport even a pony on the Leger?\"    \"No, not a sixpence, I was bitten too severely at Ascot last spring.\"    \"Never say die, you're not going to knock under to your luck that way?\"    \"I am, though, and I wish I could persuade you to do the same,  Vavasour,\" said I, laughing, and laying my hand on the shoulder of an  aristocratic looking stripling who had joined about six months before,  and who coloured to the eyes at the idea of advice on prudence.    \"Egerton is about to abjure the pomps and vanities of this wicked  world,\" said one.    \"He has been _en retrait_ with Grab'em-all, the field preacher,\" said  another.    I laughed. \"Perhaps it was as pleasant as yours with Levi Solomons, and  Co., last March,\" said I.    He reddened, but laughing good humouredly, shook his hand at me.    \"Go your own way, old fellow.\"    \"It has always been my habit, and I intend to continue it,\" said I  coolly, and made my exit.    Refusing Burton's offer of a visit to my room, on the plea of fatigue,  I threw myself in an arm chair I called my study, as I generally sat  in it when disposed for thought, and tried to arrange my entangled  ideas into something like order; the attempt, however, was not very  successful.    Sundry rough calculations as to my chances of clearing off certain  debts, and my probable amount of income; a perfect conviction that Kate  Vernon was the loveliest girl, and her grandfather the most perfect  old gentleman I had ever met; a vivid recollection of my past visit,  and an indistinct intention of doing or saying something remarkably  distinguished on my next; a vague haunting wish for some truer and  more real interest than my life had ever hitherto known; such were a  few of the elements in my reverie, and round them all floated a dim  consciousness of Mrs. Winter's cap, and Miss Araminta Cox's yellow  turban. I felt the strength of old habits returning in the levity which  mingled even with my better aspirations; and fell asleep, feeling I  had got a glimpse of happiness such as Nature had endowed me with  capabilities of enjoying, but between which and myself circumstances  had fixed a great gulf.    Of course I told Burton all my proceedings, and to do him justice he  really seemed to take an interest in them, but he laughed a little at  the Arcadian style of early tea and hot cakes. Burton, though still a  \"sub,\" was my senior in age by at least a couple of years; he had not  been in the Regiment long, and knew nothing of the Vernons; indeed,  the only officers still among us who had experienced the hospitality  of Dungar, were Dashwood, now our Colonel, Hauton, and myself. I felt  I ought to mention having met our old and popular acquaintance, yet  I did not quite like doing so. Our Colonel was a fine, high-minded,  gentleman-like fellow, who never forgot a kindness or remembered a  spite. I would rather have wished him to know Vernon was within reach;  but Hauton, I always disliked him, he was a cold-hearted _roué_, and I  would almost rather have been accessory to the introduction of Satan  to our first mother, than let Hauton get the _entrée_ of Kate Vernon's  refined and tranquil home. At the thought, a vision of it and the  inscription over its entrance rose up before me. However, as it would  have a strange effect if Colonel Dashwood was by any chance to meet  Vernon and find I had concealed my rencontre with him, I determined to  mention it, but in a casual way, hinting at the same time his change  of fortune, which I knew would prevent Hauton from taking any vivid  interest in his former hospitable entertainer.    It was not easy to get a quiet half hour in the Barracks, especially  at the present exciting period--the approaching Doncaster meeting;  so in order to enjoy an uninterrupted conference, Burton and I  mounted our horses, and took the least frightful of the roads round  Carrington. I endeavoured to convey to my companion some idea of the  impression stamped on my mind by the few days I had spent at A----;  its peace and simplicity, it's freedom from monotony and ennui! but  it would not do; Burton was, as I think I have said, a kind-hearted,  high minded fellow, but singularly free from imagination. I fancy he  had met a few harder rubs in his contact with the world than I had;  not that he ever talked of his own circumstances, but it was evident  he was not rich.    \"All this is very fine,\" said he, at the end of my"]]]
