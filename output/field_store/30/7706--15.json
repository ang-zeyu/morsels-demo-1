Deem now,  What change in thee the song, and what my smile  had wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.  In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,  The vengeance were already known to thee,  Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,  The sword of heav'n is not in haste to smite,  Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,  Who in desire or fear doth look for it.  But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;  So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold.\"  Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw  A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew  By interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,  As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,  Abates in him the keenness of desire,  Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,  One largest and most lustrous onward drew,  That it might yield contentment to my wish;  And from within it these the sounds I heard.    \"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity  That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,  Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty bound  Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,  I will make answer even to the thought,  Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,  That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,  Was on its height frequented by a race  Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,  Who thither carried first the name of Him,  Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.  And such a speeding grace shone over me,  That from their impious worship I reclaim'd  The dwellers round about, who with the world  Were in delusion lost.  These other flames,  The spirits of men contemplative, were all  Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force  Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.  Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:  And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd  Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart.\"    I answ'ring, thus; \"Thy gentle words and kind,  And this the cheerful semblance, I behold  Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,  Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening it  Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a rose  Before the sun, when the consummate flower  Has spread to utmost amplitude.  Of thee  Therefore entreat I, father! to declare  If I may gain such favour, as to gaze  Upon thine image, by no covering veil'd.\"    \"Brother!\"  he thus rejoin'd, \"in the last sphere  Expect completion of thy lofty aim,  For there on each desire completion waits,  And there on mine: where every aim is found  Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe.  There all things are as they have ever been:  For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,  Our ladder reaches even to that clime,  And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.  Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch  Its topmost round, when it appear'd to him  With angels laden.  But to mount it now  None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule  Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;  The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned into dens,  The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.  Foul usury doth not more lift itself  Against God's pleasure, than that fruit which makes  The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'er  Is in the church's keeping, all pertains.  To such, as sue for heav'n's sweet sake, and not  To those who in respect of kindred claim,  Or on more vile allowance.  Mortal flesh  Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not  From the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting.

And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,  Then look what it hath err'd to, thou shalt find  The white grown murky.  Jordan was turn'd back;  And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,  May at God's pleasure work amendment here.\"    So saying, to his assembly back he drew:  And they together cluster'd into one,  Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.    The sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:  And, by that influence only, so prevail'd  Over my nature, that no natural motion,  Ascending or descending here below,  Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.    So, reader, as my hope is to return  Unto the holy triumph, for the which  I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,  Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting  Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere  The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,  And enter'd its precinct.  O glorious stars!  O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!  To whom whate'er of genius lifteth me  Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;  With ye the parent of all mortal life  Arose and set, when I did first inhale  The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace  Vouchsaf'd me entrance to the lofty wheel  That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed  My passage at your clime.  To you my soul  Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now  To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.    \"Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,\"  Said Beatrice, \"that behooves thy ken  Be vigilant and clear.  And, to this end,  Or even thou advance thee further, hence  Look downward, and contemplate, what a world  Already stretched under our feet there lies:  So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,  Present itself to the triumphal throng,  Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing.\"    I straight obey'd; and with mine eye return'd  Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe  So pitiful of semblance, that perforce  It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold  For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts  Elsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best.  I saw the daughter of Latona shine  Without the shadow, whereof late I deem'd  That dense and rare were cause.  Here I sustain'd  The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;  And mark'd, how near him with their circle, round  Move Maia and Dione; here discern'd  Jove's tempering 'twixt his sire and son; and hence  Their changes and their various aspects  Distinctly scann'd.  Nor might I not descry  Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;  Nor of their several distances not learn.  This petty area (o'er the which we stride  So fiercely), as along the eternal twins  I wound my way, appear'd before me all,  Forth from the havens stretch'd unto the hills.  Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return'd.          CANTO XXIII    E'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower  Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,  With her sweet brood, impatient to descry  Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,  In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:  She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,  That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze  Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,  Removeth from the east her eager ken;  So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance  Wistfully on that region, where the sun  Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her  Suspense and wand'ring, I became as one,  In whom desire is waken'd, and the hope  Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.    Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,  Long in expectance, when I saw the heav'n  Wax more and more resplendent; and, \"Behold,\"  Cried Beatrice, \"the triumphal hosts  Of Christ, and all the harvest reap'd at length  Of thy ascending up these spheres.\"  Meseem'd,  That, while she spake her image all did burn,  And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,  And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.    As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,  In peerless beauty, 'mid th' eternal nympus,  That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound  In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,  O'er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew  Their radiance as from ours the starry train:  And through the living light so lustrous glow'd  The substance, that my ken endur'd it not.    O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!  Who cheer'd me with her comfortable words!  \"Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,  Avails not to resist.  Here is the might,  And here the wisdom, which did open lay  The path, that had been yearned for so long,  Betwixt the heav'n and earth.\"  Like to the fire,  That, in a cloud imprison'd doth break out  Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg'd,  It falleth against nature to the ground;  Thus in that heav'nly banqueting my soul  Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost.  Holds now remembrance none of what she was.    \"Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen  Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile.\"    I was as one, when a forgotten dream  Doth come across him, and he strives in vain  To shape it in his fantasy again,  Whenas that gracious boon was proffer'd me,  Which never may be cancel'd from the book,  Wherein the past is written.  Now were all  Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk  Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed  And fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,  Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,  My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,  flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.  And with such figuring of Paradise  The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets  A sudden interruption to his road.  But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,  And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,  May pardon, if it tremble with the burden.  The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks  No unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot.    \"Why doth my face,\" said Beatrice, \"thus  Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn  Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming  Beneath the rays of Christ?  Here is the rose,  Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;  And here the lilies, by whose odour known  The way of life was follow'd.\"  Prompt I heard  Her bidding, and encounter once again  The strife of aching vision.  As erewhile,  Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,  Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,  Though veil'd themselves in shade; so saw I there  Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays  Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not  The fountain whence they flow'd.

He was, about this time, invited both by Henry VIII. of England,  and Margaret of Austria, Governess of the Low Countries, to fix his  residence in their dominions. He chose the service of the latter, by  whose influence he was made historiographer to the Emperor Charles V.  Unfortunately for Agrippa, he never had stability enough to remain  long in one position, and offended his patrons by his restlessness and  presumption. After the death of Margaret, he was imprisoned at Brussels,  on a charge of sorcery. He was released after a year; and, quitting  the country, experienced many vicissitudes. He died in great poverty in  1534, aged forty-eight years.    While in the service of Margaret of Austria, he resided principally  at Louvain, in which city he wrote his famous work on the Vanity and  Nothingness of human Knowledge. He also wrote, to please his Royal  Mistress, a treatise upon the Superiority of the Female Sex, which he  dedicated to her, in token of his gratitude for the favours she had  heaped upon him. The reputation he left behind him in these provinces  was anything but favourable. A great number of the marvellous tales that  are told of him, relate to this period of his life. It was said, that  the gold which he paid to the traders with whom he dealt, always looked  remarkably bright, but invariably turned into pieces of slate and stone  in the course of four-and-twenty hours. Of this spurious gold he was  believed to have made large quantities by the aid of the devil, who, it  would appear from this, had but a very superficial knowledge of alchymy,  and much less than the Marechal de Rays gave him credit for. The  Jesuit Delrio, in his book on Magic and Sorcery, relates a still more  extraordinary story of him. One day, Agrippa left his house, at Louvain;  and, intending to be absent for some time, gave the key of his study  to his wife, with strict orders that no one should enter it during his  absence. The lady herself, strange as it may appear, had no curiosity to  pry into her husband's secrets, and never once thought of entering the  forbidden room: but a young student, who had been accommodated with an  attic in the philosopher's house, burned with a fierce desire to  examine the study; hoping, perchance, that he might purloin some book or  implement which would instruct him in the art of transmuting metals. The  youth, being handsome, eloquent, and, above all, highly complimentary to  the charms of the lady, she was persuaded, without much difficulty, to  lend him the key, but gave him strict orders not to remove anything. The  student promised implicit obedience, and entered Agrippa's study. The  first object that caught his attention, was a large grimoire, or book  of spells, which lay open on the philosopher's desk. He sat himself down  immediately, and began to read. At the first word he uttered, he fancied  he heard a knock at the door. He listened; but all was silent. Thinking  that his imagination had deceived him, he read on, when immediately a  louder knock was heard, which so terrified him, that he started to his  feet. He tried to say, \"come in;\" but his tongue refused its office, and  he could not articulate a sound. He fixed his eyes upon the door, which,  slowly opening, disclosed a stranger of majestic form, but scowling  features, who demanded sternly, why he was summoned? \"I did not  summon you,\" said the trembling student. \"You did!\" said the stranger,  advancing, angrily; \"and the demons are not to be invoked in vain.\"  The student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the  uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized  him by the throat and strangled him. When Agrippa returned, a few days  afterwards, he found his house beset with devils. Some of them were  sitting on the chimneypots, kicking up their legs in the air; while  others were playing at leapfrog, on the very edge of the parapet. His  study was so filled with them that he found it difficult to make his  way to his desk. When, at last, he had elbowed his way through them, he  found his book open, and the student lying dead upon the floor. He saw  immediately how the mischief had been done; and, dismissing all the  inferior imps, asked the principal demon how he could have been so rash  as to kill the young man. The demon replied, that he had been needlessly  invoked by an insulting youth, and could do no less than kill him for  his presumption. Agrippa reprimanded him severely, and ordered him  immediately to reanimate the dead body, and walk about with it in the  market-place for the whole of the afternoon. The demon did so: the  student revived; and, putting his arm through that of his unearthly  murderer, walked very lovingly with him, in sight of all the people. At  sunset, the body fell down again, cold and lifeless as before, and was  carried by the crowd to the hospital, it being the general opinion  that he had expired in a fit of apoplexy. His conductor immediately  disappeared. When the body was examined, marks of strangulation were  found on the neck, and prints of the long claws of the demon on various  parts of it. These appearances, together with a story, which soon  obtained currency, that the companion of the young man had vanished in  a cloud of flame and smoke, opened people's eyes to the truth. The  magistrates of Louvain instituted inquiries; and the result was, that  Agrippa was obliged to quit the town.    Other authors besides Delrio relate similar stories of this philosopher.  The world in those days was always willing enough to believe in tales of  magic and sorcery; and when, as in Agrippa's case, the alleged magician  gave himself out for such, and claimed credit for the wonders he worked,  it is not surprising that the age should have allowed his pretensions.  It was dangerous boasting, which sometimes led to the stake or the  gallows, and therefore was thought to be not without foundation. Paulus  Jovius, in his \"Eulogia Doctorum Virorum,\" says, that the devil, in the  shape of a large black dog, attended Agrippa wherever he went. Thomas  Nash, in his adventures of Jack Wilton, relates, that at the request of  Lord Surrey, Erasmus, and some other learned men, Agrippa called up from  the grave many of the great philosophers of antiquity; among others,  Tully, whom he caused to re-deliver his celebrated oration for Roscius.  He also showed Lord Surrey, when in Germany, an exact resemblance in  a glass of his mistress the fair Geraldine. She was represented on her  couch weeping for the absence of her lover. Lord Surrey made a note of  the exact time at which he saw this vision, and ascertained afterwards  that his mistress was actually so employed at the very minute. To Thomas  Lord Cromwell, Agrippa represented King Henry VIII. hunting in Windsor  Park, with the principal lords of his court; and to please the Emperor  Charles V. he summoned King David and King Solomon from the tomb.    Naude, in his \"Apology for the Great Men who have been falsely suspected  of Magic,\" takes a great deal of pains to clear Agrippa from the  imputations cast upon him by Delrio, Paulus Jovius, and other such  ignorant and prejudiced scribblers. Such stories demanded refutation in  the days of Naude, but they may now be safely left to decay in their own  absurdity. That they should have attached, however, to the memory of a  man, who claimed the power of making iron obey him when he told it to  become gold, and who wrote such a work as that upon magic, which goes by  his name, is not at all surprising.    PARACELSUS.    This philosopher, called by Naude, \"the zenith and rising sun of all the  alchymists,\" was born at Einsiedeln, near Zurich, in the year 1493.  His true name was Hohenheim; to which, as he himself informs us,  were prefixed the baptismal names of Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastes  Paracelsus. The last of these he chose for his common designation while  he was yet a boy; and rendered it, before he died, one of the most  famous in the annals of his time. His father, who was a physician,  educated his son for the same pursuit. The latter was an apt scholar,  and made great progress. By chance the work of Isaac Hollandus fell into  his hands, and from that time he became smitten with the mania of  the philosopher's stone. All his thoughts henceforth were devoted to  metallurgy; and he travelled into Sweden that he might visit the mines  of that country, and examine the ores while they yet lay in the bowels  of the earth. He also visited Trithemius at the monastery of Spannheim,  and obtained instructions from him in the science of alchymy. Continuing  his travels, he proceeded through Prussia and Austria into Turkey,  Egypt, and Tatary, and thence returning to Constantinople, learned, as  he boasted, the art of transmutation, and became possessed of the  elixir vitae. He then established himself as a physician in his native  Switzerland at Zurich, and commenced writing works upon alchymy and  medicine, which immediately fixed the attention of Europe. Their great  obscurity was no impediment to their fame; for the less the author  was understood, the more the demonologists, fanatics, and  philosopher's-stone-hunters seemed to appreciate him. His fame as a  physician kept pace with that which he enjoyed as an alchymist, owing  to his having effected some happy cures by means of mercury and opium;  drugs unceremoniously condemned by his professional brethren. In the  year 1526, he was chosen Professor of Physics and Natural Philosophy in  the University of Basle, where his lectures attracted vast numbers of  students. He denounced the writings of all former physicians as tending  "]]]
