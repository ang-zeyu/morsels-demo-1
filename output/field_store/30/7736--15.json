I found such loads of them I  forgot everything else, and I must have walked on a little way. On  turning to go back I couldn't find the little hill. I have hunted in  vain for the clearing. It seems as if I have been wandering about for  hours. I'm so glad you've found me!\"    \"Weren't you told to stay in the settlement, inside the clearing?\"  demanded Jonathan.    \"Yes,\" replied Helen, with her head up.    \"Why didn't you?\"    \"Because I didn't choose.\"    \"You ought to have better sense.\"    \"It seems I hadn't,\" Helen said quietly, but her eyes belied that calm  voice.    \"You're a headstrong child,\" Jonathan added curtly.    \"Mr. Zane!\" cried Helen with pale face.    \"I suppose you've always had your own sweet will; but out here on the  border you ought to think a little of others, if not of yourself.\"    Helen maintained a proud silence.    \"You might have run right into prowlin' Shawnees.\"    \"That dreadful disaster would not have caused you any sorrow,\" she  flashed out.    \"Of course it would. I might have lost my scalp tryin' to get you back  home,\" said Jonathan, beginning to hesitate. Plainly he did not know  what to make of this remarkable young woman.    \"Such a pity to have lost all your fine hair,\" she answered with a  touch of scorn.    Jonathan flushed, perhaps for the first time in his life. If there was  anything he was proud of, it was his long, glossy hair.    \"Miss Helen, I'm a poor hand at words,\" he said, with a pale, grave  face. \"I was only speakin' for your own good.\"    \"You are exceedingly kind; but need not trouble yourself.\"    \"Say,\" Jonathan hesitated, looking half-vexed at the lovely, angry  face. Then an idea occurred to him. \"Well, I won't trouble. Find your  way home yourself.\"    Abruptly he turned and walked slowly away. He had no idea of allowing  her to go home alone; but believed it might be well for her to think  so. If she did not call him back he would remain near at hand, and  when she showed signs of anxiety or fear he could go to her.    Helen determined she would die in the woods, or be captured by  Shawnees, before calling him back. But she watched him. Slowly the  tall, strong figure, with its graceful, springy stride, went down the  glade. He would be lost to view in a moment, and then she would be  alone. How dark it had suddenly become! The gray cloak of twilight was  spread over the forest, and in the hollows night already had settled  down. A breathless silence pervaded the woods. How lonely! thought  Helen, with a shiver. Surely it would be dark before she could find  the settlement. What hill hid the settlement from view? She did not  know, could not remember which he had pointed out. Suddenly she began  to tremble. She had been so frightened before he had found her, and so  relieved afterward; and now he was going away.    \"Mr. Zane,\" she cried with a great effort. \"Come back.\"    Jonathan kept slowly on.    \"Come back, Jonathan, please.\"    The borderman retraced his steps.    \"Please take me home,\" she said, lifting a fair face all flushed,  tear-stained, and marked with traces of storm. \"I was foolish, and  silly to come into the woods, and so glad to see you! But you spoke to  me--in--in a way no one ever used before. I'm sure I deserved it.  Please take me home. Papa will be worried.\"    Softer eyes and voice than hers never entreated man.    \"Come,\" he said gently, and, taking her by the hand, he led her up the  ridge.    Thus they passed through the darkening forest, hand in hand, like a  dusky redman and his bride. He helped her over stones and logs, but  still held her hand when there was no need of it. She looked up to see  him walking, so dark and calm beside her, his eyes ever roving among  the trees. Deepest remorse came upon her because of what she had said.  There was no sentiment for him in this walk under the dark canopy of  the leaves. He realized the responsibility. Any tree might hide a  treacherous foe. She would atone for her sarcasm, she promised  herself, while walking, ever conscious of her hand in his, her bosom  heaving with the sweet, undeniable emotion which came knocking at  her heart.    Soon they were out of the thicket, and on the dusty lane. A few  moments of rapid walking brought them within sight of the twinkling  lights of the village, and a moment later they were at the lane  leading to Helen's home. Releasing her hand, she stopped him with a  light touch and said:    \"Please don't tell papa or Colonel Zane.\"    \"Child, I ought. Some one should make you stay at home.\"    \"I'll stay. Please don't tell. It will worry papa.\"    Jonathan Zane looked down into her great, dark, wonderful eyes with an  unaccountable feeling. He really did not hear what she asked.  Something about that upturned face brought to his mind a rare and  perfect flower which grew in far-off rocky fastnesses. The feeling he  had was intangible, like no more than a breath of fragrant western  wind, faint with tidings of some beautiful field.    \"Promise me you won't tell.\"    \"Well, lass, have it your own way,\" replied Jonathan, wonderingly  conscious that it was the first pledge ever asked of him by a woman.    \"Thank you. Now we have two secrets, haven't we?\" she laughed, with  eyes like stars.    \"Run home now, lass. Be careful hereafter. I do fear for you with such  spirit an' temper. I'd rather be scalped by Shawnees than have Bing  Legget so much as set eyes on you.\"    \"You would? Why?\" Her voice was like low, soft music.    \"Why?\" he mused. \"It'd seem like a buzzard about to light on a doe.\"    \"Good-night,\" said Helen abruptly, and, wheeling, she hurried down the  lane.          CHAPTER VIII    \"Jack,\" said Colonel Zane to his brother next morning, \"to-day is  Saturday and all the men will be in. There was high jinks over at  Metzar's place yesterday, and I'm looking for more to-day. The two  fellows Alex Bennet told me about, came on day-before-yesterday's  boat. Sure enough, one's a lordly Englishman, and the other, the  cussedest-looking little chap I ever saw. They started trouble  immediately. The Englishman, his name is Mordaunt, hunted up the  Sheppards and as near as I can make out from George's story, Helen  spoke her mind very plainly. Mordaunt and Case, that's his servant,  the little cuss, got drunk and raised hell down at Metzar's where  they're staying. Brandt and Williams are drinking hard, too, which is  something unusual for Brandt. They got chummy at once with the  Englishman, who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling.  This Mordaunt is a gentleman, or I never saw one. I feel sorry for  him. He appears to be a ruined man. If he lasts a week out here I'll  be surprised. Case looks ugly, as if he were spoiling to cut somebody.  I want you to keep your eye peeled. The day may pass off as many other  days of drinking bouts have, without anything serious, and on the  other hand there's liable to be trouble.\"    Jonathan's preparations were characteristic of the borderman. He laid  aside his rifle, and, removing his short coat, buckled on a second  belt containing a heavier tomahawk and knife than those he had been  wearing. Then he put on his hunting frock, or shirt, and wore it loose  with the belts underneath, instead of on the outside. Unfastened, the  frock was rather full, and gave him the appearance of a man unarmed  and careless.    Jonathan Zane was not so reckless as to court danger, nor, like many  frontiersmen, fond of fighting for its own sake. Colonel Zane was  commandant of the fort, and, in a land where there was no law, tried  to maintain a semblance of it. For years he had kept thieves,  renegades and outlaws away from his little settlement by dealing out  stern justice. His word was law, and his bordermen executed it as  such. Therefore Jonathan and Wetzel made it their duty to have a keen  eye on all that was happening. They kept the colonel posted, and never  interfered in any case without orders.    The morning passed quietly. Jonathan strolled here or loitered there;  but saw none of the roisterers. He believed they were sleeping off the  effects of their orgy on the previous evening. After dinner he smoked  his pipe. Betty and Helen passed, and Helen smiled. It struck him  suddenly that she had never looked at him in such a way before. There  was meaning in that warm, radiant flash. A little sense of vexation,  the source of which he did not understand, stirred in him against this  girl; but with it came the realization that her white face and big,  dark eyes had risen before him often since the night before. He  wished, for the first time, that he could understand women better.    \"Everything quiet?\" asked Colonel Zane, coming out on the steps.    \"All quiet,\" answered Jonathan.    \"They'll open up later, I suspect. I'm going over to Sheppard's for a  while, and, later, will drop into Metzar's. I'll make him haul in a  yard or two. I don't like things I hear about his selling the  youngsters rum. I'd like you to be within call.\"    The borderman strolled down the bluff and along the path which  overhung the river. He disliked Metzar more than his brother  suspected, and with more weighty reason than that of selling rum to  minors. Jonathan threw himself at length on the ground and mused over  the situation.    \"We never had any peace in this settlement, an' never will in our day.  Eb is hopeful an' looks at the bright side, always expectin' to-morrow  will be different. What have the past sixteen years been? One long  bloody fight, an' the next sixteen won't be any better. I make out  that we'll have a mix-up soon. Metzar an' Brandt with their allies,  whoever they are, will be in it, an' if Bing Legget's in the gang,  we've got, as Wetzel said, a long, hard trail, which may be our last.  More'n that, there'll be trouble about this chain-lightnin' girl, as  Wetzel predicted. Women make trouble anyways; an' when they're winsome  an' pretty they cause more;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9935"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.

ABBREVIATIONS OF MEASURES.--In order to simplify directions and  recipes in books relating to cookery, it is customary to use the  abbreviations of some weights and measures. Those which occur most  frequently in cook books are the following:    tsp. for teaspoonful  pt. for pint  Tb. for tablespoonful  qt. for quart  c. for cupful  oz. for ounce  lb. for pound      ORDER OF WORK    36. For successful results in cookery, the work to be done should be  planned beforehand and then carried on with systematic care. By  following such a plan, a waste of time and material will be prevented  and good results will be secured, for there will be little chance for  mistakes to occur. The order of work here outlined will serve to make  clear the way in which cooking processes can be carried out  satisfactorily.    First, read the quantity and kind of ingredients listed in the recipe,  and study carefully the method by which they are to be prepared and  combined. In so doing, determine whether the dish is too expensive and  whether the amounts called for will make a dish sufficient in size for  the number of persons to be served. If they are too large, carefully  divide them to make the right quantity; if they are too small, multiply  them to make them enough.    The heat itself, which plays such an important part in cooking, should  receive attention at the proper time. If the fuel to be used is coal or  wood and baking is to be done, build the fire long enough before it is  needed, so that it will be burning evenly and steadily.    Then, while the recipe is being prepared, provided it is to be baked,  regulate the heat of the oven. If gas or kerosene is to be used, light  it after the recipe is read, and regulate it during the measuring and  mixing of the ingredients.    Before proceeding to prepare a dish, clear enough working space for the  utensils that are to be used, as well as for carrying on the various  operations without feeling crowded. Then, on the cleared space, place  the necessary measuring utensils, such as a measuring cup, a knife, a  teaspoon, and a tablespoon. Select a bowl or a pan for mixing, a spoon  for stirring, and, when needed, an egg whip or beater for eggs and  separate bowls in which to beat them. Choose the utensil in which the  mixture is to be cooked, and, if necessary, grease it. During the  process of preparing the dish, measure accurately all the ingredients to  be used, and check them up with the recipe, so as to be sure that none  are missing and that each one is in its proper amount.    If all these steps are accurately taken, the mixing, which is the next  step, can be accomplished quickly and without error. With all the  ingredients properly combined, the mixture is ready for the last step,  the cooking or the baking. This must be done with the utmost care, or an  otherwise properly prepared dish may be spoiled.      TABLE FOR COOKING FOODS    37. So that the beginner in cookery may form a definite idea of the  length of time required to cook certain foods, there is presented here  what is commonly known as a _cookery time table_. It should be  remembered that the time required to cook food is influenced by many  factors. For instance, the age of vegetables and fruits very largely  determines how long they should be cooked; tough meats and fowl require  longer cooking than tender ones; and the heat of the oven has much to do  with the length of time required for cooking, especially the process of  baking or roasting Therefore, while this time table will prove of great  help to beginners, it can serve only as a guide. To determine whether or  not foods have been cooked long enough, it is advisable to apply the  proper tests, which are given later in discussing the various foods  rather than to depend solely on the time table. In this table, the  length of time for cooking is given in minutes (abbreviated min.) and  hours (abbreviated hr.)

Although, as has been explained, the selection and preparation of  foods require much consideration from the housewife who desires to get  good results in cookery, there is still one thing to which she must give  attention if she would keep down the cost of living, and that is the  care of food. Unless food is properly taken care of before it is cooked,  as well as after it is cooked--that is, the left-overs--considerable  loss is liable to result through its spoiling or decaying. Both uncooked  and cooked food may be kept wholesome in several ways, but before these  are discussed it may be well to look into the causes of spoiling. With  these causes understood, the methods of caring for foods will be better  appreciated, and the results in buying, storing, and handling foods will  be more satisfactory.    39. To come to a knowledge of why foods spoil, it will be well to note  that nature abounds in _micro-organisms_, or living things so minute as  to be invisible to the naked eye. These micro-organisms are known to  science as _microbes_ and _germs_, and they are comprised of _bacteria,  yeasts_, and _molds_, a knowledge of which is of the utmost importance  to the physician and the farmer, as well as the housewife. Just in what  ways these are beneficial to the farmer and the physician is beyond the  scope of the subject of cookery, but in the household their influence is  felt in three ways: They"]]]
