See also        Deut. XV, 1-11, and _Tractate Shebiit_ of the _Mishnah_.          (32) _I.e._, war.          (33) By prohibiting the permissible and permitting the        prohibited.          (34) Cf. chapter IV, 9.          (35) Cf. chapter IV, 5.          (36) See Deut. XIV, 28, 29; XXVI, 12, and also above, chapter        I, n. 37.          (37) Of the septennial cycle.  The tithe was to be brought at        the end of _every_ three years.          (38) _I.e._, the gleanings and the forgotten sheaves of the        harvest, the single bunches of grapes of the vineyard, and the        unreaped corners of the fields which were assigned to the        stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.    13. There are four characters among men: he who says, \"What is mine is  mine and what is thine is thine,\" his is a neutral character; some  say, \"This is a character like that of Sodom\" (39); he who says, \"What  is mine is thine and what is thine is mine,\" is a boor (40); he who  says, \"What is mine is thine and what is thine is thine,\" is a saint;  he who says, \"What is thine is mine and what is mine is mine,\" is a  wicked man.  14. There are four kinds of tempers: he whom it is easy  to provoke and easy to pacify, his loss disappears in his gain; he  whom it is hard to provoke and hard to pacify, his gain disappears in  his loss; he whom it is hard to provoke and easy to pacify is a saint;  he whom it is easy to provoke and hard to pacify is a wicked man.  15.  There are four qualities in disciples: he who quickly understands and  quickly forgets, his gain disappears in his loss; he who understands  with difficulty and forgets with difficulty, his loss disappears in  his gain; he who understands quickly and forgets with difficulty, his  is a good portion; he who understands with difficulty and forgets  quickly, his is an evil portion.  16. As to almsgiving there are four  dispositions: he who desires to give, but that others should not give,  his eye is evil toward what appertains to others (41); he who desires  that others should give, but will not give himself, his eye is evil  against what is his own; he who gives and wishes others to give is a  saint; he who will not give and does not wish others to give is a  wicked man.  17. There are four characters among those who attend the  house of study: he who goes and does not practise (42) secures the  reward for going; he who practises (43) but does not go secures the  reward for practising; he who goes and practises is a saint; he who  neither goes nor practises is a wicked man.  18. There are four  qualities among those that sit before the wise: they are like a  sponge, a funnel, a strainer, or a sieve: a sponge, which sucks up  everything (44); a funnel, which lets in at one end and out at the  other; a strainer, which lets the wine pass out and retains the dregs;  a sieve, which lets out the bran and retains the fine flour.          (39) One who neither gives nor takes.  One who does no labor        of love.  Cf. Ezek. XVI, 49.          (40) He does not know the sacredness of the rights of        property.          (41) He does not want his neighbors to be blessed because of        their liberality.          (42) The duties of which he has learned.          (43) The commands of the _Torah_.          (44) The true and the untrue.    19. Whenever love depends upon some material cause, with the passing  away of that cause, the love, too, passes away (45); but if it be not  depending upon such a cause, it will not pass away for ever.  Which  love was that which depended upon a material cause?  Such was the love  of Ammon and Tamar (46).  And that which depended upon no such cause?  Such was the love of David and Jonathan (47).          (45) Lasting love is disinterested love.          (46) See II Sam. XII.          (47) See I Sam. XVIII, 1.    20. Every controversy that is in the Name of Heaven (48) shall in the  end lead to a permanent result, but every controversy that is not in  the Name of Heaven shall not lead to a permanent result.  Which  controversy was that which was in the Name of Heaven?  Such was the  controversy of Hillel and Shammai (49).  And that which was not in the  Name of Heaven?  Such was the controversy of Korah and all his company  (50).          (48) _I.e._, a controversy to arrive at the truth.          (49) See chapter I, n. 29.          (50) See Num. XV, 1 _et seq._    21. Whosoever causes the multitude to be righteous, over him sin  prevails not; but he who causes the multitude to sin shall not have  the means to repent (51).  Moses was righteous and made the multitude  righteous; the righteousness of the multitude was laid upon him, as it  is said, \"He executed the justice of the Lord and his judgments with  Israel\" (52).  Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, sinned and caused the  multitude to sin; the sin of the multitude was laid upon him, as it is  said, \"For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made  Israel to sin\" (53).          (51) He who leads the people astray is punished by being        prevented from repenting.  This does not mean, however, that        man, in general, does not act in accordance with his own free        will.  Maimonides, in discussing this problem, says, in the        eighth chapter of the _Shemonah Perakim_, \"Just as some of        man's undertakings, which are ordinarily subject to his own        free will, are frustrated by way of punishment, as, for        instance, a man's hand being prevented from working so that he        can do nothing with it, as was the case of Jeroboam, the son        of Nebat, or a man's eyes from seeing, as happened to the        Sodomites, who had assembled about Lot, likewise how does God        withhold man's ability to use his own free will in regard to        repentance, so that it never occurs to him to repent, and he        thus finally perishes in his own wickedness.\"  See ed.        Gorfinkle, p. 94 _et seq._          (52) Deut. XXXIII, 21.          (53) I Kings XV, 30.  Cf. _Sanhedrin_ X, 2: \"Three kings have        no portion in the world to come . . . Jeroboam, Ahab, and        Manasseh.\"    22. Whosoever has these three attributes is of the disciples of  Abraham, our father, but whosoever has three other attributes is of  the disciples of Balaam, the wicked (54).  A good eye (55), a humble  mind, and a lowly spirit (are the tokens) of the disciples of Abraham,  our father; an evil eye, a haughty mind, and a proud spirit (are the  signs) of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked.  What is the difference  between the disciples of Abraham, our father, and those of Balaam, the  wicked?  The disciples of Abraham, our father, enjoy this world and  inherit the world to come, as it is said, \"That I may cause those that  love me to inherit substance, and may fill all their treasuries\" (56);  but the disciples of Balaam, the wicked, inherit _Gehinnom_ (57), and  descend into the pit of destruction, as it is said, \"But thou, O God,  wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloodthirsty and  deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in  thee\" (58).          (54) See Num. XXII-XXIV.          (55) See chapter II, note 30.          (56) Prov. VIII, 21: \"Substance,\" _i.e._, in the future world;        \"treasures,\" _i.e._, in this world.          (57) See chapter I, n. 18.          (58) Ps. LIV, 24.    23. Judah, the son of Tema, said, \"Be bold as a leopard, swift as an  eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion, to do the will of thy  Father who is in Heaven\" (59).  24. He used to say (60), \"At five  years (the age is reached for the study of the) Scripture, at ten for  (the study of) the _Mishnah_ (61), at thirteen for (the fulfilment of)  the commandments (62), at fifteen for (the study of) the _Talmud_  (63), at eighteen for marriage, at twenty for seeking (a livelihood)  (64), at thirty for (entering into one's full) strength, at forty for  understanding, at fifty for counsel, at sixty (a man attains) old age,  at seventy the hoary head, at eighty (the gift of special) strength  (65), at ninety, (he bends beneath) the weight of years, at a hundred  he is as if he were already dead and had passed away from the world.\"          (59) Cf. \"Our Father which is in Heaven\" of the \"Lord's        Prayer\" (Matt. VI, 9).  The conception of God as a \"Father\"        goes back to earliest times.  See Gen. XLIX, 19, 20; Ex. IV,        22; Deut. XXXII, 6; II Sam. V, 44; Ps. LXXXIX, 27, 28; Isa.        LXIII, 16, LXIV, 8, and Mal. II, 10.  Deut. XXXII, 6, reads,        \"Is He not thy Father?\" and Isa. LXIII, 18, \"Doubtless Thou        art our Father.\"  In the _Mishnah_ we find, \"Who purifies you?         Your Father which is in Heaven\" (_Yoma_ VII, 8); \"On whom        have we to lean?  On our Father which is in Heaven\" (_Sotah_,        IX, 15), and similar passages.  The Rabbis constantly referred        to God as \"Father\" (see Schechter, _Aspects_, pp. 46, 49,        50-51).  They took issue, of course, with the New Testament        conception of God, in not admitting and in denouncing the idea        of a mediator.  To them all mankind were the sons of God.        That the Rabbis borrowed this God-idea and the expression \"Our        Father which is in Heaven\" from Christianity is untenable,        for, as Herford (_Pharisaism_, 120 _et seq._) points out, such        borrowing would have been abhorrent to them.  This expression        was undoubtedly current long before and during the time of        Jesus, and it represented a conception of the divine        acceptable to both the Rabbis and Jesus.  The Rabbis had no        quarrel with Christianity on this score, but did not admit the        \"sonship\" of God in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#14)"],[1,"excommunicated, even for crimes committed, without his consent. Whether  these were consciously formulated rules or merely generalizations from his  conduct, they state correctly the principles of his action, and exhibit  clearly in one most important sphere the unlimited power established by  the Norman Conquest.    To this year, 1070, in which was begun the reformation of the Church,  was assigned at a later time another work of constitutional interest.  The unofficial compiler of a code of laws, the Leges Edwardi, written  in the reign of Henry I, and drawn largely from the legislation of the  Saxon kings, ascribed his work, after a fashion not unusual with  writers of his kind, to the official act of an earlier king. He relates  that a great national inquest was ordered by King William in this year,  to ascertain and establish the laws of the English. Each county elected  a jury of twelve men, who knew the laws, and these juries coming  together in the presence of the king declared on oath what were the  legal customs of the land. So runs the preface of the code which was  given out as compiled from this testimony. Such a plan and procedure  would not be out of harmony with what we know of William's methods  and policy. The machinery of the jury, which was said to be employed,  was certainly introduced into England by the first Norman king, and  was used by him for the establishment of facts, both in national  undertakings like the Domesday Book and very probably in local cases  arising in the courts. We know also that he desired to leave the old  laws undisturbed so far as possible, and the year 1070 is one in which  an effort to define and settle the future legal code of the state would  naturally fall. But the story must be rejected as unhistorical. An  event of such importance as this inquisition must have been, if it  took place, could hardly have occurred without leaving its traces in  contemporary records of some sort, and an official code of this kind  would have produced results in the history of English law of which we  find no evidence. The Saxon law and the machinery of the local courts  did survive the Conquest with little change, but no effort was made to  reduce the customs of the land to systematic and written form until a  later time, until a time indeed when the old law was beginning to give  place to the new.

CHAPTER III      WILLIAM'S LATER YEARS    Political events had not waited for the reformation of the Church, and  long before these reforms were completed, England had become a thoroughly  settled state under the new king. The beginning of the year 1070 is a  turning-point in the reign of William. The necessity for fighting was not  over, but from this date onwards there was no more fighting for the  actual possession of the land. The irreconcilables had still to be dealt  with; in one small locality they retained even yet some resisting power;  the danger of foreign invasion had again to be met: but not for one  moment after William's return from the devastation of the north and west  was there even the remotest possibility of undoing the Conquest.    The Danes had withdrawn from the region of the Humber, but they had not  left the country. In the Isle of Ely, then more nearly an actual island  than in modern times, was a bit of unsubdued England, and there they  landed for a time. In this position, surrounded by fens and interlacing  rivers, accessible at only a few points, occurred the last resistance  which gave the Normans any trouble. The rich mythology which found its  starting-point in this resistance, and especially in its leader,  Hereward, we no longer mistake for history; but we should not forget that  it embodies the popular attitude towards those who stubbornly resisted  the Norman, as it was handed on by tradition, and that it reveals almost  pathetically the dearth of heroic material in an age which should have  produced it in abundance. Hereward was a tenant in a small way of the  abbey of Peterborough. What led him into such a determined revolt we do  not know, unless he was among those who were induced to join the Danes  after their arrival, in the belief that their invasion would be  successful. Nor do we know what collected in the Isle of Ely a band of  men whom the Peterborough chronicler was probably not wrong, from any  point of view, in calling outlaws. A force of desperate men could hope to  maintain themselves for some time in the Isle of Ely; they could not hope  for anything more than this. The coming of the Danes added little real  strength, though the country about believed for the moment, as it had  done north of the Humber, that the tide had turned. The first act of the  allies was the plunder and destruction of the abbey and town of  Peterborough shortly after the meeting of the council of Windsor. The  English abbot Brand had died the previous autumn, and William had  appointed in his place a Norman, Turold, distinguished as a good fighter  and a hard ruler. These qualities had led the king to select him for this  special post, and the plundering of the abbey, so far as it was not mere  marauding, looks like an answering act of spite. The Danes seem to have  been disposed at first to hold Peterborough, but Turold must have brought  them proposals of peace from William, which induced them to withdraw at  last from England with the secure possession of their plunder.    Hereward and his men accomplished nothing more that year, but others  gradually gathered in to them, including some men of note. Edwin and  Morcar had once more changed sides, or had fled from William's court to  escape some danger there. Edwin had been killed in trying to make his way  through to Scotland, but Morcar had joined the refugees in Ely. Bishop  Ethelwin of Durham was also there, and a northern thane, Siward Barn. In  1074 William advanced in person against the \"camp of refuge.\" A fleet was  sent to blockade one side while the army attacked from the other. It was  found necessary to build a long causeway for the approach of the army and  around this work the fiercest fighting occurred; but its building could  not be stopped, and just as it was finished the defenders of the Isle  surrendered. The leaders were imprisoned, Morcar in Normandy for the rest  of William's reign. The common men were mutilated and released. Hereward  escaped to sea, but probably afterwards submitted to William and received  his favour. Edric the Wild, who had long remained unsubdued on the Welsh  borders, had also yielded before the surrender of the Isle of Ely, and  the last resistance that can be called in any sense organized was at an  end.    The comparatively easy pacification of the land, the early submission to  their fate of so strong a nation, was in no small degree aided by the  completeness with which the country was already occupied by Norman  colonies, if we may call them so. Probably before the surrender of Ely  every important town was under the immediate supervision of some Norman  baron, with a force of his own. In all the strategically important places  fortified posts had been built and regular garrisons stationed. Even the  country districts had to a large extent been occupied in a similar way.  It is hardly probable that as late as 1072 any considerable area in  England had escaped extensive confiscations. Everywhere the Norman had  appeared to take possession of his fief, to establish new tenants, or to  bring the old ones into new relations with himself, to arrange for the  administration of his manors, and to leave behind him the agents who were  responsible to himself for the good conduct of affairs. If he made but  little change in the economic organization of his property, and disturbed  the labouring class but slightly or not at all, he would give to a wide  district a vivid impression of the strength of the new order and of the  hopelessness of any resistance.    Already Norman families, who were to make so much of the history of the  coming centuries, were rooted in the land. Montfort and Mortimer; Percy,  Beauchamp, and Mowbray; Ferrets and Lacy; Beaumont, Mandeville, and  Grantmesnil; Clare, Bigod, and Bohun; and many others of equal or nearly  equal name. All these were as yet of no higher than baronial rank, but if  we could trust the chroniclers, we should be able to make out in addition  a considerable list of earldoms which William had established by this  date or soon afterwards, in many parts of England, and in these were  other great names. According to this evidence, his two half brothers, the  children of his mother by her marriage with Herlwin de Conteville, had  been most richly provided for: Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, as Earl of Kent,  and Robert, Count of Mortain, with a princely domain in the south-west as  Earl of Cornwall. One of the earliest to be made an earl was his old  friend and the son of his guardian, William Fitz Osbern, who had been  created Earl of Hereford; he was now dead and was succeeded by his son  Roger, soon very justly to lose title and land. Shrewsbury was held by  Roger of Montgomery; Chester by Hugh of Avranches, the second earl;  Surrey by William of Warenne; Berkshire by Walter Giffard. Alan Rufus of  Britanny was Earl of Richmondshire; Odo of Champagne, Earl of Holderness;  and Ralph of Guader, who was to share in the downfall of Roger Fitz  Osbern, Earl of Norfolk. One Englishman, who with much less justice was  to be involved in the fate which rightly befell these two Norman earls,  was also earl at this time, Watheof, who had lately succeeded Gospatric  in the troubled earldom of Northumberland, and who also held the earldoms  of "]]]
