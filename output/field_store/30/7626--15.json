She says:--    \"We mean to turn over the West by means of _model schools_ in this, its  capital. We mean to have a young lady's school of about fifty or sixty,  a primary school of little girls to the same amount, and then a primary  school for _boys_. We have come to the conclusion that the work of  teaching will never be rightly done till it passes into _female_ hands.  This is especially true with regard to boys. To govern boys by moral  influences requires tact and talent and versatility it requires also  the same division of labor that female education does. But men of tact,  versatility, talent, and piety will not devote their lives to teaching.  They must be ministers and missionaries, and all that, and while there  is such a thrilling call for action in this way, every man who is  merely teaching feels as if he were a Hercules with a distaff, ready  to spring to the first trumpet that calls him away. As for division of  labor, men must have salaries that can support wife and family, and, of  course, a revenue would be required to support a requisite number of  teachers if they could be found.    \"Then, if men have more knowledge they have less talent at  communicating it, nor have they the patience, the long-suffering, and  gentleness necessary to superintend the formation of character. We  intend to make these principles understood, and ourselves to set the  example of what females can do in this way. You see that first-rate  talent is necessary for all that we mean to do, especially for the  last, because here we must face down the prejudices of society and we  must have exemplary success to be believed. We want original, planning  minds, and you do not know how few there are among females, and how few  we can command of those that exist.\"    During the summer of 1834 the young teacher and writer made her first  visit East since leaving New England two years before. Its object  was mainly to be present at the graduation of her favorite brother,  Henry Ward, from Amherst College. The earlier part of this journey  was performed by means of stage to Toledo, and thence by steamer  to Buffalo. A pleasant bit of personal description, and also of  impressions of Niagara, seen for the first time on this journey, are  given in a letter sent back to Cincinnati during its progress. In it  she says of her fellow-travelers:--    \"Then there was a portly, rosy, clever Mr. Smith, or Jones, or  something the like; and a New Orleans girl looking like distraction, as  far as dress is concerned, but with the prettiest language and softest  intonations in the world, and one of those faces which, while you say  it isn't handsome, keeps you looking all the time to see what it can  be that is so pretty about it. Then there was Miss B., an independent,  good-natured, do-as-I-please sort of a body, who seemed of perpetual  motion from morning till night. Poor Miss D. said, when we stopped at  night, 'Oh, dear! I suppose Lydia will be fiddling about our room till  morning, and we shall not one of us sleep.' Then, by way of contrast,  there was a Mr. Mitchell, the most gentlemanly, obliging man that ever  changed his seat forty times a day to please a lady. Oh, yes, he could  ride outside,--or, oh, certainly, he could ride inside,--he had no  objection to this, or that, or the other. Indeed, it was difficult to  say what could come amiss to him. He speaks in a soft, quiet manner,  with something of a drawl, using very correct, well-chosen language,  and pronouncing all his words with carefulness; has everything in his  dress and traveling appointments _comme il faut_; and seems to think  there is abundant time for everything that is to be done in this  world, without, as he says, 'any unnecessary excitement.' Before the  party had fully discovered his name he was usually designated as 'the  obliging gentleman,' or 'that gentleman who is so accommodating.' Yet  our friend, withal, is of Irish extraction, and I have seen him roused  to talk with both hands and a dozen words in a breath. He fell into  a little talk about abolition and slavery with our good Mr. Jones, a  man whose mode of reasoning consists in repeating the same sentence at  regular intervals as long as you choose to answer it. This man, who was  finally convinced that negroes were black, used it as an irrefragible  argument to all that could be said, and at last began to deduce from  it that they might just as well be slaves as anything else, and so he  proceeded till all the philanthropy of our friend was roused, and he  sprung up all lively and oratorical and gesticulatory and indignant to  my heart's content. I like to see a quiet man that can be roused.\"    In the same letter she gives her impressions of Niagara, as follows:--    \"I have seen it (Niagara) and yet live. Oh, where is your soul? Never  mind, though. Let me tell, if I can, what is unutterable. Elisabeth,  it is not _like_ anything; it did not look like anything I expected;  it did not look like a waterfall. I did not once think whether it was  high or low; whether it roared or didn't roar; whether it equaled my  expectations or not. My mind whirled off, it seemed to me, in a new,  strange world. It seemed unearthly, like the strange, dim images in the  Revelation. I thought of the great white throne; the rainbow around  it; the throne in sight like unto an emerald; and oh! that beautiful  water rising like moonlight, falling as the soul sinks when it dies,  to rise refined, spiritualized, and pure. That rainbow, breaking out,  trembling, fading, and again coming like a beautiful spirit walking the  waters. Oh, it is lovelier than it is great; it is like the Mind that  made it: great, but so veiled in beauty that we gaze without terror.  I felt as if I could have _gone over_ with the waters; it would be  so beautiful a death; there would be no fear in it. I felt the rock  tremble under me with a sort of joy. I was so maddened that I could  have gone too, if it had gone.\"    While at the East she was greatly affected by hearing of the death of  her dear friend, Eliza Tyler, the wife of Professor Stowe. This lady  was the daughter of Dr. Bennett Tyler, president of the Theological  Institute of Connecticut, at East Windsor; but twenty-five years of  age at the time of her death, a very beautiful woman gifted with a  wonderful voice. She was also possessed of a well-stored mind and a  personal magnetism that made her one of the most popular members of  the Semi-Colon Club, in the proceedings of which she took an active  interest.    Her death left Professor Stowe a childless widower, and his forlorn  condition greatly excited the sympathy of her who had been his wife's  most intimate friend. It was easy for sympathy to ripen into love,  and after a short engagement Harriet E. Beecher became the wife of  Professor Calvin E. Stowe.    Her last act before the wedding was to write the following note to the  friend of her girlhood, Miss Georgiana May:--                                             _January 6, 1836._        Well, my dear G., about half an hour more and your old      friend, companion, schoolmate, sister, etc., will cease      to be Hatty Beecher and change to nobody knows who. My      dear, you are engaged, and pledged in a year or two to      encounter a similar fate, and do you wish to know how      you shall feel? Well, my dear, I have been dreading      and dreading the time, and lying awake all last week      wondering how I should live through this overwhelming      crisis, and lo! it has come and I feel _nothing at all_.        The wedding is to be altogether domestic; nobody      present but my own brothers and sisters, and my old      colleague, Mary Dutton; and as there is a sufficiency      of the ministry in our family we have not even to      call in the foreign aid of a minister. Sister Katy is      not here, so she will not witness my departure from      her care and guidance to that of another. None of my      numerous friends and acquaintances who have taken such      a deep interest in making the connection for me even      know the day, and it will be all done and over before      they know anything about it.        Well, it is really a mercy to have this entire      stupidity come over one at such a time. I should be      crazy to feel as I did yesterday, or indeed to feel      anything at all. But I inwardly vowed that my last      feelings and reflections on this subject should be      yours, and as I have not got any, it is just as well to      tell you _that_. Well, here comes Mr. S., so farewell,      and for the last time I subscribe                                        Your own                                           H. E. B.

THE letter to her friend Georgiana May, begun half an hour before her  wedding, was not completed until nearly two months after that event.  Taking it from her portfolio, she adds:--    \"Three weeks have passed since writing the above, and my husband  and self are now quietly seated by our own fireside, as domestic as  any pair of tame fowl you ever saw; he writing to his mother, and I  to you. Two days after our marriage we took a wedding excursion, so  called, though we would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#14)"],[1," from the pages of Wisden. Bannister, his  cheerful predecessor in the Postage Department, was the Bannister, he  recollected now, who had played for Geddington against Wrykyn in his  second year in the Wrykyn team. Munroe, the big man in the Fixed  Deposits, he remembered as leader of the Ripton pack. Every day brought  fresh discoveries of this sort, and each made Mike more reconciled to  his lot. They were a pleasant set of fellows in the New Asiatic Bank,  and but for the dreary outlook which the future held--for Mike, unlike  most of his follow workers, was not attracted by the idea of a life in  the East--he would have been very fairly content.    The hostility of Mr Bickersdyke was a slight drawback. Psmith had  developed a habit of taking Mike with him to the club of an evening;  and this did not do anything towards wiping out of the manager's mind  the recollection of his former passage of arms with the Old Wrykinian.  The glass remaining Set Fair as far as Mr Rossiter's approval was  concerned, Mike was enabled to keep off the managerial carpet to a  great extent; but twice, when he posted letters without going through  the preliminary formality of stamping them, Mr Bickersdyke had  opportunities of which he availed himself. But for these incidents life  was fairly enjoyable. Owing to Psmith's benevolent efforts, the Postage  Department became quite a happy family, and ex-occupants of the postage  desk, Bannister especially, were amazed at the change that had come  over Mr Rossiter. He no longer darted from his lair like a pouncing  panther. To report his subordinates to the manager seemed now to be a  lost art with him. The sight of Psmith and Mr Rossiter proceeding high  and disposedly to a mutual lunch became quite common, and ceased to  excite remark.    'By kindness,' said Psmith to Mike, after one of these expeditions. 'By  tact and kindness. That is how it is done. I do not despair of training  Comrade Rossiter one of these days to jump through paper hoops.'    So that, altogether, Mike's life in the bank had become very fairly  pleasant.    Out of office-hours he enjoyed himself hugely. London was strange to  him, and with Psmith as a companion, he extracted a vast deal of  entertainment from it. Psmith was not unacquainted with the West End,  and he proved an excellent guide. At first Mike expostulated with  unfailing regularity at the other's habit of paying for everything, but  Psmith waved aside all objections with languid firmness.    'I need you, Comrade Jackson,' he said, when Mike lodged a protest on  finding himself bound for the stalls for the second night in  succession. 'We must stick together. As my confidential secretary and  adviser, your place is by my side. Who knows but that between the acts  tonight I may not be seized with some luminous thought? Could I utter  this to my next-door neighbour or the programme-girl? Stand by me,  Comrade Jackson, or we are undone.'    So Mike stood by him.    By this time Mike had grown so used to his work that he could tell to  within five minutes when a rush would come; and he was able to spend a  good deal of his time reading a surreptitious novel behind a pile of  ledgers, or down in the tea-room. The New Asiatic Bank supplied tea to  its employees. In quality it was bad, and the bread-and-butter  associated with it was worse. But it had the merit of giving one an  excuse for being away from one's desk. There were large printed notices  all over the tea-room, which was in the basement, informing gentlemen  that they were only allowed ten minutes for tea, but one took just as  long as one thought the head of one's department would stand, from  twenty-five minutes to an hour and a quarter.    This state of things was too good to last. Towards the beginning of the  New Year a new man arrived, and Mike was moved on to another  department.          14. Mr Waller Appears in a New Light      The department into which Mike was sent was the Cash, or, to be more  exact, that section of it which was known as Paying Cashier. The  important task of shooting doubloons across the counter did not belong  to Mike himself, but to Mr Waller. Mike's work was less ostentatious,  and was performed with pen, ink, and ledgers in the background.  Occasionally, when Mr Waller was out at lunch, Mike had to act as  substitute for him, and cash cheques; but Mr Waller always went out at  a slack time, when few customers came in, and Mike seldom had any very  startling sum to hand over.    He enjoyed being in the Cash Department. He liked Mr Waller. The work  was easy; and when he did happen to make mistakes, they were corrected  patiently by the grey-bearded one, and not used as levers for boosting  him into the presence of Mr Bickersdyke, as they might have been in  some departments. The cashier seemed to have taken a fancy to Mike; and  Mike, as was usually the way with him when people went out of their way  to be friendly, was at his best. Mike at his ease and unsuspicious of  hostile intentions was a different person from Mike with his prickles  out.    Psmith, meanwhile, was not enjoying himself. It was an unheard-of  thing, he said, depriving a man of his confidential secretary without  so much as asking his leave.    'It has caused me the greatest inconvenience,' he told Mike, drifting  round in a melancholy way to the Cash Department during a slack spell  one afternoon. 'I miss you at every turn. Your keen intelligence and  ready sympathy were invaluable to me. Now where am I? In the cart. I  evolved a slightly bright thought on life just now. There was nobody to  tell it to except the new man. I told it him, and the fool gaped. I  tell you, Comrade Jackson, I feel like some lion that has been robbed  of its cub. I feel as Marshall would feel if they took Snelgrove away  from him, or as Peace might if he awoke one morning to find Plenty  gone. Comrade Rossiter does his best. We still talk brokenly about  Manchester United--they got routed in the first round of the Cup  yesterday and Comrade Rossiter is wearing black--but it is not the  same. I try work, but that is no good either. From ledger to ledger  they hurry me, to stifle my regret. And when they win a smile from me,  they think that I forget. But I don't. I am a broken man. That new  exhibit they've got in your place is about as near to the Extreme Edge  as anything I've ever seen. One of Nature's blighters. Well, well, I  must away. Comrade Rossiter awaits me.'    Mike's successor, a youth of the name of Bristow, was causing Psmith a  great deal of pensive melancholy. His worst defect--which he could not  help--was that he was not Mike. His others--which he could--were  numerous. His clothes were cut in a way that harrowed Psmith's sensitive  soul every time he looked at them. The fact that he wore detachable  cuffs, which he took off on beginning work and stacked in a glistening  pile on the desk in front of him, was no proof of innate viciousness of  disposition, but it prejudiced the Old Etonian against him. It was part  of Psmith's philosophy that a man who wore detachable cuffs had passed  beyond the limit of human toleration. In addition, Bristow wore a small  black moustache and a ring and that, as Psmith informed Mike, put the  lid on it.    Mike would sometimes stroll round to the Postage Department to listen  to the conversations between the two. Bristow was always friendliness  itself. He habitually addressed Psmith as Smithy, a fact which  entertained Mike greatly but did not seem to amuse Psmith to any  overwhelming extent. On the other hand, when, as he generally did, he  called Mike 'Mister Cricketer', the humour of the thing appeared to  elude Mike, though the mode of address always drew from Psmith a pale,  wan smile, as of a broken heart made cheerful against its own  inclination.    The net result of the coming of Bristow was that Psmith spent most of  his time, when not actually oppressed by a rush of work, in the  precincts of the Cash Department, talking to Mike and Mr Waller. The  latter did not seem to share the dislike common among the other heads  of departments of seeing his subordinates receiving visitors. Unless  the work was really heavy, in which case a mild remonstrance escaped  him, he offered no objection to Mike being at home to Psmith. It was  this tolerance which sometimes got him into trouble with Mr  Bickersdyke. The manager did not often perambulate the office, but he  did occasionally, and the interview which ensued upon his finding  Hutchinson, the underling in the Cash Department at that time, with his  stool tilted comfortably against the wall, reading the sporting news  from a pink paper to a friend from the Outward Bills Department who lay  luxuriously on the floor beside him, did not rank among Mr Waller's  pleasantest memories. But Mr Waller was too soft-hearted to interfere  with his assistants unless it was absolutely necessary. The truth of  the matter was that the New Asiatic Bank was over-staffed. There were  too many men for the work. The London branch of the bank was really  only a nursery. New men were constantly wanted in the Eastern branches,  so they had to be put into the London branch to learn the business,  whether there was any work for them to do or not.    It was after one of these visits of Psmith's that Mr Waller displayed a  new and unsuspected side to his character. Psmith had come round in a  state of some depression to discuss Bristow, as usual. Bristow, it  seemed, had come to the bank that morning in a fancy waistcoat of so  emphatic a colour-scheme that Psmith stoutly refused to sit in the same  department with it.    'What with Comrades Bristow and Bickersdyke combined,' said Psmith  plaintively, 'the work is becoming too hard for me. The whisper is  beginning to circulate, \"Psmith's number is up--As a reformer he is  merely among those present. He is losing his dash.\" But what can I do?  I cannot keep an eye on both of them"]]]
