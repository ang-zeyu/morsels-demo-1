Nam sicuti durare in hac beatissimi saeculi luce ac  principem Trajanum videre, quod augurio votisque apud nostras aures  ominabatur, ita festinatae mortis grande solatium tulit, evasisse  postremum illud tempus, quo Domitianus non jam per intervalla ac  spiramenta temporum, sed continuo et velut uno ictu rempublicam exhausit.    XLV. Non vidit Agricola obsessam curiam, et clausum armis senatum, et  eadem strage tot consularium caedes, tot nobilissimarum feminarum exsilia  et fugas. Una adhuc victoria Carus Metius censebatur, et intra Albanam  arcem sententia Messalini strepebat, et Massa Bebius jam tum reus erat.  Mox nostrae duxere Helvidium in carcerem manus: nos Maurici Rusticique  visus, nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit.

Tu vero felix,  Agricola, non vitae tantum claritate, sed etiam opportunitate mortis. Ut  perhibent qui interfuerunt novissimis sermonibus tuis, constans et libens  fatum excepisti; tanquam pro virili portione innocentiam principi  donares. Sed mihi filiaeque ejus, praeter acerbitatem parentis erepti,  auget moestitiam, quod assidere valetudini, fovere deficientem, satiari  vultu, complexu, non contigit: excepissemus certe mandata vocesque, quas  penitus animo figeremus.

The Treatise DE SITU, MORIBUS ET POPULIS GERMANIAE, was written (as  appears from the treatise itself see § 37) in the second consulship of  the Emperor Trajan, A.U.C. 851, A.D. 98. The design of the author in its  publication has been variously interpreted. From the censure which it  frequently passes upon the corruption and degeneracy of the times, it has  been considered as a mere satire upon Roman manners, in the age of  Tacitus. But to say nothing of the ill adaptation of the whole plan to a  satirical work, there are large parts of the treatise, which must have  been prepared with great labor, and yet can have no possible bearing on  such a design. Satires are not wont to abound in historical notices and  geographical details, especially touching a foreign and distant land.    The same objection lies against the _political_ ends, which have been  imputed to the author, such as the persuading of Trajan to engage, or  _not_ to engage, in a war with the Germans, as the most potent and  dangerous enemy of Rome. For both these aims have been alleged, and we  might content ourselves with placing the one as an offset against the  other. But aside from the neutralizing force of such contradictions,  wherefore such an imposing array of geographical research, of historical  lore, of political and moral philosophy, for the accomplishment of so  simple a purpose? And why is the purpose so scrupulously concealed, that  confessedly it can be gathered only from obscure intimations, and those  of ambiguous import? Besides, there are passages whose tendency must have  been directly counter to either of these alleged aims (cf. note § 33).  The author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem to appreciate  with almost prophetic accuracy, those dangers to the Roman Empire, which  were so fearfully illustrated in its subsequent fall beneath the power of  the German Tribes; and he utters, as what true Roman would not in such  forebodings, the warnings and the prayers of a patriot sage. But he does  this only in episodes, which are so manifestly incidental, and yet arise  so naturally out of the narrative or description, that it is truly  surprising it should ever have occurred to any reader, to seek in them  the key to the whole treatise.    The entire warp and woof of the work is obviously _historical_ and  _geographical_. The satire, the political maxims, the moral sentiments,  and all the rest, are merely incidental, interwoven for the sake of  instruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind so thoughtful and  so acute as that of Tacitus, could not leave them out. Tacitus had long  been collecting the materials for his Roman Histories. In so doing, his  attention was necessarily drawn often and with special interest to a  people, who, for two centuries and more, had been the most formidable  enemy of the Roman State. In introducing them into his history, he would  naturally wish to give some preliminary account of their origin, manners,  and institutions, as he does in introducing the Jews in the Fifth Book of  his Histories, which happens to be, in part, preserved. Nor would it be  strange, if he should, with this view, collect a mass of materials, which  he could not incorporate entire into a work of such compass, and which  any slight occasion might induce him to publish in a separate form,  perhaps as a sort of forerunner to his Histories. [It has even been  argued by highly respectable scholars, that the Germania of Tacitus is  itself only such a collection of materials, not published by the Author,  and never intended for publication in that form. But it is quite too  methodical, too studied, and too finished a work to admit of that  supposition (cf. Prolegom. of K.).] Such an occasion now was furnished  in the campaigns and victories of Trajan, who, at the time of his  elevation to the imperial power, was at the head of the Roman armies in  Germany, where he also remained for a year or more after his accession to  the throne, till he had received the submission of the hostile tribes and  wiped away the disgrace which the Germans, beyond any other nation of  that age, had brought upon the Roman arms. Such a people, at such a time,  could not fail to be an object of deep interest at Rome. This was the  time when Tacitus published his work on Germany; and such are believed  to have been the motives and the circumstances, which led to the  undertaking. His grand object was not to point a satire or to compass a  political end, but as he himself informs us (§ 27), to treat of the  origin and manners, the geography and history, of the German Tribes.    The same candor and sincerity, the same correctness and truthfulness,  which characterize the Histories, mark also the work on Germany. The  author certainly aimed to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, on  the subject of which he treats. Moreover, he had abundant means of  knowing the truth, on all the main points, in the character and history  of the Germans. It has even been argued from such expression as _vidimus_  (§ 8), that Tacitus had himself been in Germany, and could, therefore,  write from personal observation. Bnt the argument proceeds on a  misinterpretation of his language (cf. note in _loc. cit_.). And the use  of _accepimus_ (as in § 27), shows that he derived his information from  others. But the Romans had been in constant intercourse and connection,  civil or military, with the Germans, for two hundred years. Germany  furnished a wide theatre for their greatest commanders, and a fruitful  theme for their best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#14)"],[1," or less  frequent, there appears to be a great deal of confusion upon the  subject.  Any society is competent to decide what shall constitute one  of its sessions, but, where there is no rule on the subject, the common  parliamentary law would make each of its regular or special meetings a  separate session, as they are regarded in this Manual.    The disadvantages of a rule making a session include all the meetings of  an ordinary society, held during a long time as one year, are very  great.  [Examine Indefinitely Postpone, Sec. 24, and Renewal of a Motion, Sec.  26.] If members of any society take advantage of the freedom allowed by  considering    === Page 93 ============================================================    each regular meeting a separate session, and repeatedly renew obnoxious  or unprofitable motions, the society can adopt a rule prohibiting the  second introduction of any principal question [Sec. 6] within, say, three  or six months after its rejection, or indefinite postponement, or after  the society has refused to consider it.  But generally it is better to  suppress the motion by refusing to consider it [Sec. 15].    43. A Quorum of an assembly is such a number as is competent to  transact its business.  Without there is a special rule on the subject,  the quorum of every assembly is a majority of all the members of the  assembly.  But whenever a society has any permanent existence, it is  usual to adopt a much smaller number, the quorum being often less than  one-twentieth of its members; this becomes a necessity in most large  societies, where only a small fraction of the members are ever present  at a meeting.* [While a quorum is competent to transact any business, it  is usually not expedient to transact important business without there is  a fair attendance at the meeting, or else previous notice of such action  has been given.]    The Chairman should not take the chair till a quorum is present, except  where there is no hope of there being a quorum, and then no business can  be transacted, except simply    === Page 94 ============================================================    to adjourn.  So whenever during the meeting there is found not to be a  quorum present, the only thing to be done is to adjourn--though if no  question is raised about it, the debate can be continued, but no vote  taken, except to adjourn.    In committee of the whole, the quorum is the same as in the assembly; in  any other committee the majority is a quorum, without the assembly order  otherwise, and it must wait for a quorum before proceeding to business.  If the number afterwards should be reduced below a quorum, business is  not interrupted, unless a member calls attention to the fact; but no  question can be decided except when a quorum is present.  Boards of  Trustees, Managers, Directors, etc., are on the same footing as  committees, in regard to a quorum.  Their power is delegated to them as  a body, and what number shall be present in order that they may act as a  Board, is to be decided by the society that appoints the Board.  If no  quorum is specified, then a majority constitutes a quorum.    44. Order of Business.  It is customary for every society having a  permanent existence,    === Page 95 ============================================================    to adopt an order of business for its meetings.  When no rule has been  adopted, the following is the order:      (1) Reading the Minutes of the previous meeting [and their approval].    (2) Reports of Standing Committees.    (3) Reports of Select Committees.    (4) Unfinished Business.    (5) New Business.    Boards of Managers, Trustees, etc., come under the head of standing  committees.  Questions that have been postponed from a previous  meeting, come under the head of unfinished business; and if a subject  has been made a \"special order\" for the day, it shall take precedence of  all business except reading the minutes.  If it is desired to transact  business out of its order, it is necessary to suspend the rules [Sec. 18],  which can only be done by a two-thirds vote; but as each subject comes  up, a majority can at once lay it on the table [Sec. 19], and thus reach  any question which they desire to first dispose of.    The order of business, in considering any report or proposition  containing several paragraphs,* [No vote should be taken on the adoption  of the several paragraphs,--one vote being taken finally on the  adoption of the whole paper.  By not adopting separately the different  paragraphs, it is in order, after they have all been amended, to go back  and amend any of them still further.  In committee a similar paper would  be treated the same way [see Sec. 30].  In Sec. 48 (b) an illustration is  given of the practical application of this section.] is as follows:    === Page 96 ============================================================    The whole paper should be read entirely through by the clerk; then the  Chairman should read it by paragraphs, pausing at the end of each, and  asking, \"Are there any amendments proposed to this paragraph?\"  If none  are offered, he says, \"No amendments being offered to this paragraph,  the next will be read;\" he then reads the next, and proceeds thus to the  last paragraph, when he states that the whole report or resolutions have  been read, and are open to amendment. He finally puts the question on  agreeing to or adopting the whole paper as amended.  If there is a  preamble it should be read after the last paragraph.    If the paper has been reported back by a committee with amendments, the  clerk reads only the amendments, and the Chairman then reads the first  and puts it to the question, and so on till all the amendments are  adopted or rejected, admitting amendments to the committee's amendments,  but no others.  When    === Page 97 ============================================================    through with the committee's amendments, the Chairman pauses for any  other amendments to be proposed by the assembly; and when these are  voted on, he puts the question on agreeing to or adopting the paper as  amended.  Where the resolutions have been just read by the member  presenting them, the reading by the clerk is usually dispensed with  without the formality of a vote.  By \"suspending the rules\" [Sec. 18], or  by general consent, a report can be at once adopted without following  any of the above routine.    45. Amendments of Rules of Order.  These rules can be amended at any  regular meeting of the assembly, by a two-thirds vote of the members  present, provided the amendment was submitted in writing at the previous  regular meeting.  And no amendment to Constitutions or By-Laws shall be  permitted, without at least equal notice and a two-thirds vote.*  [Constitutions, By-Laws and Rules of Order should always prohibit their  being amended by less than a two-thirds vote, and without previous  notice of the amendment being given.  If the By-Laws should contain  rules that it may be desirable to occasionally suspend, then they should  state how they can be suspended, just as is done in these Rules of  Order, Sec. 18.  If there is no such rule it is impossible to suspend any  rule, if a single member objects.    === Page 98 ============================================================  === Page 99 ============================================================    PART II.    ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.*  [The exact words used by the chairman or member, are in many cases in  quotations.  It is not to be inferred that these are the only forms  permitted, but that these forms are proper and common.  They are  inserted for the benefit of those unaccustomed to parliamentary forms,  and are sufficiently numerous for ordinary meetings.]    Art. IX.  Organization and Meetings.  [Sec.Sec. 46-49.]    46. An Occasional or Mass Meeting.  (a) Organization.  When a meeting  is held which is not one of an organized society, shortly after the  time appointed for the meeting, some member of the assembly steps  forward and says:  \"The meeting will please come to order; I move that  Mr. A. act as chairman of this meeting.\"  Some one else says, \"I second  the motion.\"  The first member then puts the    === Page 100 ===========================================================    question to vote, by saying, \"It has been moved and seconded that Mr. A.  act as chairman of this meeting; those in favor of the motion will say  aye,\" and when the affirmative vote is taken, he says, \"those opposed  will say no.\"  If the majority vote in the affirmative, he says, \"The  motion is carried; Mr. A. will take the chair.\"  If the motion is lost,  he announces that fact, and calls for the nomination of some one else  for chairman, and proceeds with the new nomination as in the first  case.* [Sometimes a member nominates a chairman and no vote is taken,  the assembly signifying their approval by acclamation.  The member who  calls the meeting to order, instead of making the motion himself, may  act as temporary chairman, and say:  \"The meeting will please come to  order:  will some one nominate a chairman?\"  He puts the question to  vote on the nomination as described above.  In large assemblies, the  member who nominates, with one other member, frequently conducts the  presiding officer to the chair, and the chairman makes a short speech,  thanking the assembly for the honor conferred on him.]    When Mr. A. takes the chair, he says, \"The first business in order is  the election of a secretary.\"  Some one then makes a motion as just  described, or he says \"I nominate Mr. B,\" when the chairman puts the  question as before.  Sometimes several names are called out, and the  chairman, as he hears them, says, \"Mr. B. is nominated; Mr. C. is  nominated,\" etc; he then takes a vote on the first one he heard, putting  the question thus:  \"As many as are in favor of    === Page 101 ==================================="]]]
