He tries to question  me in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the  blazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover  the floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for  something to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the  Austrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,  shows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first  fresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on  my fork, when she enters.    I rise.    \"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my  servant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She  turns around and leaves.    Meanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later  I climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is  already there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a  narrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small  air-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one  of the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons  under the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I  have to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by  my own laughter.    Suddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical  Italian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I  pick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive  in front of her door on the first floor and knock.    \"Come in!\"    I enter, shut the door, and stand attention.    Wanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of  white muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a  footstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It  is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,  as goddess of love.    The yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,  their reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the  open fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown  sable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair  of the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,  and her cold green eyes rest upon me.    \"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.    I bowed.    \"Come closer.\"    I obeyed.    \"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her  hand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more  than an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your  dreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into  effect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it  impresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only  thing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual  circumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your  weakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early  emperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation  an anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired  Girondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their  lips. But you are my slave, my--\"    She suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her  arms with soft pressure about my neck.    \"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how  handsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night  up in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my  furs, dear heart, the large one there--\"    She quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before  I knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.    \"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your  noble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a  velvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never  put on my fur-jacket again.\"    And again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me  down on the little divan.    \"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,  quick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"    I placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into  the sleeve.    \"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.  Don't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the  world is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet  my slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still  free, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part  magnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it  already, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I  command it.\"    \"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.    \"Yes, you must.\"    \"Even if you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you  the more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat  me. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my  senses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her  moist lips.    \"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my  enthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth  against her neck.    \"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore  me--don't you hear?\"    She boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.    \"Help me into my furs, slave.\"    I helped her, as well as I could.    \"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she  struck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.    \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.    \"No, no,\" I exclaimed.    \"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now  kiss me again.\"    I threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As  she lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously  oppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were  embracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my  flesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.    With my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable  servant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.    \"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the  most beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and  now you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,  they don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing  them out into fields of ice.    \"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated  rooms.\"           *       *       *       *       *    During the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had  been dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been  looking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a  sleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had  shown me to the unheated room.    \"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is  the North Pole.\"    A moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth  ice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the  ermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter  than the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began  to kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.    \"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.    She laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but  a huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.    I cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when  I awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.    Early in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought  the coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful  mistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh  and roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I  was about to withdraw respectfully.    \"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we  will go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer  than I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for  more than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian  is having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines  isn't extinct yet.'\"    Half an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the  Russian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I  walked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected  momentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely  a street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear  the sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only  when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself  ascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.    We entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable  habitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said  to me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is  charming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are  really annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must  kiss you. Let's go into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#14)"],[1,"you. You'd have me up before  the prefects.\"    \"Not a bit of it. This is a private affair between ourselves. I'm not  going to drag the prefects into it. You seem to want to make this  house worse than it is. I want to make it more or less decent. We  can't both have what we want.\"    There was a pause.    \"When would it be convenient for you to be touched up before the whole  house?\" inquired Kennedy, pleasantly.    \"What?\"    \"Well, you see, it seems the only thing. I must take it out of some  one for this house-match business, and you started it. Will tonight  suit you, after supper?\"    \"You'll get it hot if you try to touch me.\"    \"We'll see.\"    \"You'd funk taking me on in a scrap,\" said Walton.    \"Would I? As a matter of fact, a scrap would suit me just as well.  Better. Are you ready now?\"    \"Quite, thanks,\" sneered Walton. \"I've knocked you out before, and  I'll do it again.\"    \"Oh, then it was you that night at camp? I thought so. I spotted your  style. Hitting a chap when he wasn't ready, you know, and so on. Now,  if you'll wait a minute, I'll send across to Blackburn's for Silver. I  told him I should probably want him as a time-keeper tonight.\"    \"What do you want with Silver. Why won't Perry do?\"    \"Thanks, I'm afraid Perry's time-keeping wouldn't be impartial enough.  Silver, I think, if you don't mind.\"    Spencer was summoned once more, and despatched to Blackburn's. He  returned with Jimmy.    \"Come in, Jimmy,\" said Kennedy. \"Run away, Spencer. Walton and I are  just going to settle a point of order which has arisen, Jimmy. Will  you hold the watch? We ought just to have time before tea.\"    \"Where?\" asked Silver.    \"My dormitory would be the best place. We can move the beds. I'll go  and get the keys.\"    Kennedy's dormitory was the largest in the house. After the beds had  been moved back, there was a space in the middle of fifteen feet one  way, and twelve the other--not a large ring, but large enough for two  fighters who meant business.    Walton took off his coat, waistcoat, and shirt. Kennedy, who was still  in football clothes, removed his blazer.    \"Half a second,\" said Jimmy Silver--\"what length rounds?\"    \"Two minutes?\" said Kennedy to Walton.    \"All right,\" growled Walton.    \"Two minutes, then, and half a minute in between.\"    \"Are you both ready?\" asked Jimmy, from his seat on the chest of  drawers.    Kennedy and Walton advanced into the middle of the impromptu ring.    There was dead silence for a moment.    \"Time!\" said Jimmy Silver.          XIII    THE FIGHT IN THE DORMITORY      Stating it broadly, fighters may be said to be divided into two  classes--those who are content to take two blows if they can give  three in return, and those who prefer to receive as little punishment  as possible, even at the expense of scoring fewer points themselves.  Kennedy's position, when Jimmy Silver called time, was peculiar. On  all the other occasions on which he had fought--with the gloves on in  the annual competition, and at the assault-at-arms--he had gone in for  the policy of taking all that the other man liked to give him, and  giving rather more in exchange. Now, however, he was obliged to alter  his whole style. For a variety of reasons it was necessary that he  should come out of this fight with as few marks as possible. To begin  with, he represented, in a sense, the Majesty of the Law. He was  tackling Walton more by way of an object-lesson to the Kayite  mutineers than for his own personal satisfaction. The object-lesson  would lose in impressiveness if he were compelled to go about for a  week or so with a pair of black eyes, or other adornments of a similar  kind. Again--and this was even more important--if he was badly marked  the affair must come to the knowledge of the headmaster. Being a  prefect, and in the sixth form, he came into contact with the Head  every day, and the disclosure of the fact that he had been engaged in  a pitched battle with a member of his house, who was, in addition to  other disadvantages, very low down in the school, would be likely to  lead to unpleasantness. A school prefect of Eckleton was supposed to  be hedged about with so much dignity that he could quell turbulent  inferiors with a glance. The idea of one of the august body lowering  himself to the extent of emphasising his authority with the bare  knuckle would scandalise the powers.    So Kennedy, rising at the call of time from the bed on which he sat,  came up to the scratch warily.    Walton, on the other hand, having everything to gain and nothing to  lose, and happy in the knowledge that no amount of bruises could do  him any harm, except physically, came on with the evident intention of  making a hurricane fight of it. He had very little science as a boxer.  Heavy two-handed slogging was his forte, and, as the majority of his  opponents up to the present had not had sufficient skill to discount  his strength, he had found this a very successful line of action.  Kennedy and he had never had the gloves on together. In the  competition of the previous year both had entered in their respective  classes, Kennedy as a lightweight, Walton in the middles, and both,  after reaching the semi-final, had been defeated by the narrowest of  margins by men who had since left the school. That had been in the  previous Easter term, and, while Walton had remained much the same as  regards weight and strength, Kennedy, owing to a term of hard bowling  and a summer holiday spent in the open, had filled out. They were now  practically on an equality, as far as weight was concerned. As for  condition, that was all in favour of Kennedy. He played football in  his spare time. Walton, on the days when football was not compulsory,  smoked cigarettes.    Neither of the pair showed any desire to open the fight by shaking  hands. This was not a friendly spar. It was business. The first move  was made by Walton, who feinted with his right and dashed in to fight  at close quarters. It was not a convincing feint. At any rate, it did  not deceive Kennedy. He countered with his left, and swung his right  at the body with all the force he could put into the hit. Walton went  back a pace, sparred for a moment, then came in again, hitting  heavily. Kennedy's counter missed its mark this time. He just stopped  a round sweep of Walton's right, ducked to avoid a similar effort of  his left, and they came together in a clinch.    In a properly regulated glove-fight, the referee, on observing the  principals clinch, says, \"Break away there, break away,\" in a sad,  reproachful voice, and the fighters separate without demur, being very  much alive to the fact that, as far as that contest is concerned,  their destinies are in his hands, and that any bad behaviour in the  ring will lose them the victory. But in an impromptu turn-up like this  one, the combatants show a tendency to ignore the rules so carefully  mapped out by the present Marquess of Queensberry's grandfather, and  revert to the conditions of warfare under which Cribb and Spring won  their battles. Kennedy and Walton, having clinched, proceeded to  wrestle up and down the room, while Jimmy Silver looked on from his  eminence in pained surprise at the sight of two men, who knew the  rules of the ring, so far forgetting themselves.    To do Kennedy justice, it was not his fault. He was only acting in  self-defence. Walton had started the hugging. Also, he had got the  under-grip, which, when neither man knows a great deal of the science  of wrestling, generally means victory. Kennedy was quite sure that he  could not throw his antagonist, but he hung on in the knowledge that  the round must be over shortly, when Walton would have to loose him.    \"Time,\" said Jimmy Silver.    Kennedy instantly relaxed his grip, and in that instant Walton swung  him off his feet, and they came down together with a crash that shook  the room. Kennedy was underneath, and, as he fell, his head came into  violent contact with the iron support of a bed.    Jimmy Silver sprang down from his seat.    \"What are you playing at, Walton? Didn't you hear me call time? It was  a beastly foul--the worst I ever saw. You ought to be sacked for a  thing like that. Look here, Kennedy, you needn't go on. I disqualify  Walton for fouling.\"    The usually genial James stammered with righteous indignation.    Kennedy sat down on a bed, dizzily.    \"No,\" he said; \"I'm going on.\"    \"But he fouled you.\"    \"I don't care. I'll look after myself. Is it time yet?\"    \"Ten seconds more, if you really are going on.\"    He climbed back on to the chest of drawers.    \"Time.\"    Kennedy came up feeling weak and sick. The force with which he had hit  his head on the iron had left him dazed.    Walton rushed in as before. He had no chivalrous desire to spare his  man by way of compensation for fouling him. What monopolised his  attention was the evident fact that Kennedy was in a bad way, and that  a little strenuous infighting might end the affair in the desired  manner.    It was at this point that Kennedy had reason to congratulate himself  on donning gymnasium shoes. They gave him that extra touch of  lightness which enabled him to dodge blows which he was too weak to  parry. Everything was vague and unreal to him. He seemed to be looking  on at a fight between Walton and some stranger.    Then the effect of his fall began to wear off. He could feel himself  growing stronger. Little by little his head cleared, and he began once  more to take a personal interest in the battle. It is astonishing what  a power a boxer, who has learnt the art carefully, has of automatic  fighting. The expert gentleman who fights under the pseudonym of \"Kid  M'Coy\" once informed the present writer that in one of his fights he  was knocked down by such a severe hit that he remembered nothing  further, and it was only on reading the paper next morning that he  found, to his surprise, that he had fought four more"]]]
