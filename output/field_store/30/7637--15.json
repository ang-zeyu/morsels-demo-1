Sometimes, at night, she was seen by some terrified squaw in the  forest, in shape like a flame of fire; and when the vision was announced  to the circle crouched around the lodge-fire, they burned a fragment of  meat to appease the female fiend.    [72] Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 16; Relation, 1634, 13.  [73] Biard, Relation, 1611, Chap. VIII.--This belief was very prevalent.  The Ottawas, according to Ragueneau (Relation des Hurons, 1648, 77),  were accustomed to invoke the \"Maker of Heaven\" at their feasts; but  they recognized as distinct persons the Maker of the Earth, the Maker of  Winter, the God of the Waters, and the Seven Spirits of the Wind. He  says, at the same time, \"The people of these countries have received  from their ancestors no knowledge of a God\"; and he adds, that there is  no sentiment of religion in this invocation.    The East, the West, the North, and the South were vaguely personified as  spirits or manitous. Some of the winds, too, were personal existences.  The West-Wind, as we have seen, was father of Manabozho. There was a  Summer-Maker and a Winter-Maker; and the Indians tried to keep the  latter at bay by throwing firebrands into the air.    When we turn from the Algonquin family of tribes to that of the  Iroquois, we find another cosmogony, and other conceptions of spiritual  existence. While the earth was as yet a waste of waters, there was,  according to Iroquois and Huron traditions, a heaven with lakes,  streams, plains, and forests, inhabited by animals, by spirits, and, as  some affirm, by human beings. Here a certain female spirit, named  Ataentsic, was once chasing a bear, which, slipping through a hole, fell  down to the earth. Ataentsic's dog followed, when she herself, struck  with despair, jumped after them. Others declare that she was kicked out  of heaven by the spirit, her husband, for an amour with a man; while  others, again, hold the belief that she fell in the attempt to gather  for her husband the medicinal leaves of a certain tree. Be this as it  may, the animals swimming in the watery waste below saw her falling, and  hastily met in council to determine what should be done. The case was  referred to the beaver. The beaver commended it to the judgment of the  tortoise, who thereupon called on the other animals to dive, bring up  mud, and place it on his back. Thus was formed a floating island, on  which Ataentsic fell; and here, being pregnant, she was soon delivered  of a daughter, who in turn bore two boys, whose paternity is  unexplained. They were called Taouscaron and Jouskeha, and presently  fell to blows, Jouskeha killing his brother with the horn of a stag. The  back of the tortoise grew into a world full of verdure and life; and  Jouskeha, with his grandmother, Ataentsic, ruled over its destinies.  [74]    [74] The above is the version of the story given by BrÃ©beuf, Relation  des Hurons, 1636, 86 (Cramoisy). No two Indians told it precisely alike,  though nearly all the Hurons and Iroquois agreed as to its essential  points. Compare Vanderdonck, Cusick, Sagard, and other writers.  According to Vanderdonck, Ataentsic became mother of a deer, a bear, and  a wolf, by whom she afterwards bore all the other animals, mankind  included. BrÃ©beuf found also among the Hurons a tradition inconsistent  with that of Ataentsic, and bearing a trace of Algonquin origin. It  declares, that, in the beginning, a man, a fox, and a skunk found  themselves together on an island, and that the man made the world out of  mud brought him by the skunk.    The Delawares, an Algonquin tribe, seem to have borrowed somewhat of the  Iroquois cosmogony, since they believed that the earth was formed on the  back of a tortoise.    According to some, Jouskeha became the father of the human race; but, in  the third generation, a deluge destroyed his posterity, so that it was  necessary to transform animals into men.--Charlevoix, III. 345.    He is the Sun; she is the Moon. He is beneficent; but she is malignant,  like the female demon of the Algonquins. They have a bark house, made  like those of the Iroquois, at the end of the earth, and they often come  to feasts and dances in the Indian villages. Jouskeha raises corn for  himself, and makes plentiful harvests for mankind. Sometimes he is seen,  thin as a skeleton, with a spike of shrivelled corn in his hand, or  greedily gnawing a human limb; and then the Indians know that a grievous  famine awaits them. He constantly interposes between mankind and the  malice of his wicked grandmother, whom, at times, he soundly cudgels. It  was he who made lakes and streams: for once the earth was parched and  barren, all the water being gathered under the armpit of a colossal  frog; but Jouskeha pierced the armpit, and let out the water. No prayers  were offered to him, his benevolent nature rendering them superfluous.  [75]    [75] Compare BrÃ©beuf, as before cited, and Sagard, Voyage des Hurons, p.  228.    The early writers call Jouskeha the creator of the world, and speak of  him as corresponding to the vague Algonquin deity, Atahocan. Another  deity appears in Iroquois mythology, with equal claims to be regarded as  supreme. He is called Areskoui, or Agreskoui, and his most prominent  attributes are those of a god of war. He was often invoked, and the  flesh of animals and of captive enemies was burned in his honor. [76]  Like Jouskeha, he was identified with the sun; and he is perhaps to be  regarded as the same being, under different attributes. Among the  Iroquois proper, or Five Nations, there was also a divinity called  Tarenyowagon, or Teharonhiawagon, [77] whose place and character it is  very difficult to determine. In some traditions he appears as the son of  Jouskeha. He had a prodigious influence; for it was he who spoke to men  in dreams. The Five Nations recognized still another superhuman  personage,--plainly a deified chief or hero. This was Taounyawatha, or  Hiawatha, said to be a divinely appointed messenger, who made his abode  on earth for the political and social instruction of the chosen race,  and whose counterpart is to be found in the traditions of the Peruvians,  Mexicans, and other primitive nations. [78]    [76] Father Jogues saw a female prisoner burned to Areskoui, and two  bears offered to him to atone for the sin of not burning more  captives.--Lettre de Jogues, 5 Aug., 1643.  [77] Le Mercier, Relation, 1670, 66; Dablon, Relation, 1671, 17. Compare  Cusick, Megapolensis, and Vanderdonck. Some writers identify  Tarenyowagon and Hiawatha. Vanderdonck assumes that Areskoui is the  Devil, and Tarenyowagon is God. Thus Indian notions are often  interpreted by the light of preconceived ideas.  [78] For the tradition of Hiawatha, see Clark, History of Onondaga, I.  21. It will also be found in Schoolcraft's Notes on the Iroquois, and in  his History, Condition, and Prospects of Indian Tribes.    The Iroquois name for God is Hawenniio, sometimes written Owayneo; but  this use of the word is wholly due to the missionaries. Hawenniio is an  Iroquois verb, and means, he rules, he is master. There is no Iroquois  word which, in its primitive meaning, can be interpreted, the Great  Spirit, or God. On this subject, see Ãtudes Philologiques sur quelques  Langues Sauvages (Montreal, 1866), where will also be found a curious  exposure of a few of Schoolcraft's ridiculous blunders in this  connection.    Close examination makes it evident that the primitive Indian's idea of a  Supreme Being was a conception no higher than might have been expected.  The moment he began to contemplate this object of his faith, and sought  to clothe it with attributes, it became finite, and commonly ridiculous.  The Creator of the World stood on the level of a barbarous and degraded  humanity, while a natural tendency became apparent to look beyond him to  other powers sharing his dominion. The Indian belief, if developed,  would have developed into a system of polytheism. [79]    [79] Some of the early writers could discover no trace of belief in a  supreme spirit of any kind. Perrot, after a life spent among the  Indians, ignores such an idea. Allouez emphatically denies that it  existed among the tribes of Lake Superior. (Relation, 1667, 11.) He  adds, however, that the Sacs and Foxes believed in a great gÃ©nie, who  lived not far from the French settlements.--Ibid., 21.    In the primitive Indian's conception of a God the idea of moral good has  no part. His deity does not dispense justice for this world or the next,  but leaves mankind under the power of subordinate spirits, who fill and  control the universe. Nor is the good and evil of these inferior beings  a moral good and evil. The good spirit is the spirit that gives good  luck, and ministers to the necessities and desires of mankind: the evil  spirit is simply a malicious agent of disease, death, and mischance.    In no Indian language could the early missionaries find a word to  express the idea of God. Manitou and Oki meant anything endowed with  supernatural powers, from a snake-skin, or a greasy Indian conjurer, up  to Manabozho and Jouskeha. The priests were forced to use a  circumlocution,--\"The Great Chief of Men,\" or \"He who lives in the Sky.\"  [80] Yet it should seem that the idea of a supreme controlling spirit  might naturally arise from the peculiar character of Indian belief. The  idea that each race of animals has its archetype or chief would easily  suggest the existence of a supreme chief of the spirits or of the human  race,--a conception imperfectly shadowed forth in Manabozho. The Jesuit  missionaries seized this advantage. \"If each sort of animal has its  king,\" they urged, \"so, too, have men; and as man is above all the  animals, so is the spirit that rules over men the master of all the  other spirits.\" The Indian mind readily accepted the idea, and tribes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#14)"],[1,"in _the ether_ by a current oscillating in a  circuit. As it is easy to grasp the way that sound waves are produced  and behave something will be told about them in this chapter and also  an explanation of how electric waves are produced and behave and thus  you will be able to get a clear understanding of them and of tuning in  general.    Damped and Sustained Mechanical Vibrations.--If you will place one end  of a flat steel spring in a vice and screw it up tight as shown at A  in Fig. 34, and then pull the free end over and let it go it will  vibrate to and fro with decreasing amplitude until it comes to rest as  shown at B. When you pull the spring over you store up energy in it  and when you let it go the stored up energy is changed into energy of  motion and the spring moves forth and back, or _vibrates_ as we call  it, until all of its stored up energy is spent.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Damped and Sustained Mechanical Vibrations.]    If it were not for the air surrounding it and other frictional losses,  the spring would vibrate for a very long time as the stored up energy  and the energy of motion would practically offset each other and so  the energy would not be used up. But as the spring beats the air the  latter is sent out in impulses and the conversion of the vibrations of  the spring into waves in the air soon uses up the energy you have  imparted to it and it comes to rest.    In order to send out _continuous waves_ in the air instead of _damped  waves_ as with a flat steel spring you can use an _electric driven  tuning fork_, see C, in which an electromagnet is fixed on the inside  of the prongs and when this is energized by a battery current the  vibrations of the prongs of the fork are kept going, or are  _sustained_, as shown in the diagram at D.    Damped and Sustained Electric Oscillations.--The vibrating steel  spring described above is a very good analogue of the way that damped  electric oscillations which surge in a circuit set up and send out  periodic electric waves in the ether while the electric driven tuning  fork just described is likewise a good analogue of how sustained  oscillations surge in a circuit and set up and send out continuous  electric waves in the ether as the following shows.    Now the inductance and resistance of a circuit such as is shown at A  in Fig. 35, slows down, and finally damps out entirely, the electric  oscillations of the high frequency currents, see B, where these are  set up by the periodic discharge of a condenser, precisely as the  vibrations of the spring are damped out by the friction of the air and  other resistances that act upon it. As the electric oscillations surge  to and fro in the circuit it is opposed by the action of the ether  which surrounds it and electric waves are set up in and sent out  through it and this transformation soon uses up the energy of the  current that flows in the circuit.    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Damped and Sustained Electric Oscillations.]    To send out _continuous waves_ in the ether such as are needed for  wireless telephony instead of _damped waves_ which are, at the present  writing, generally used for wireless telegraphy, an _electric  oscillation arc_ or a _vacuum tube oscillator_ must be used, see C,  instead of a spark gap. Where a spark gap is used the condenser in the  circuit is charged periodically and with considerable lapses of time  between each of the charging processes, when, of course, the condenser  discharges periodically and with the same time element between them.  Where an oscillation arc or a vacuum tube is used the condenser is  charged as rapidly as it is discharged and the result is the  oscillations are sustained as shown at D.    About Mechanical Tuning.--A tuning fork is better than a spring or a  straight steel bar for setting up mechanical vibrations. As a matter  of fact a tuning fork is simply a steel bar bent in the middle so that  the two ends are parallel. A handle is attached to middle point of the  fork so that it can be held easily and which also allows it to vibrate  freely, when the ends of the prongs alternately approach and recede  from one another. When the prongs vibrate the handle vibrates up and  down in unison with it, and imparts its motion to the _sounding box_,  or _resonance case_ as it is sometimes called, where one is used.    If, now, you will mount the fork on a sounding box which is tuned so  that it will be in resonance with the vibrations of the fork there  will be a direct reinforcement of the vibrations when the note emitted  by it will be augmented in strength and quality. This is called  _simple resonance_. Further, if you mount a pair of forks, each on a  separate sounding box, and have the forks of the same size, tone and  pitch, and the boxes synchronized, that is, tuned to the same  frequency of vibration, then set the two boxes a foot or so apart, as  shown at A in Fig. 36, when you strike one of the forks with a rubber  hammer it will vibrate with a definite frequency and, hence, send out  sound waves of a given length. When the latter strike the second fork  the impact of the molecules of air of which the sound waves are formed  will set its prongs to vibrating and it will, in turn, emit sound  waves of the same length and this is called _sympathetic resonance_,  or as we would say in wireless the forks are _in tune_.    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Sound Wave and Electric Wave Tuned Senders  and Receptors. A - variable tuning forks for showing sound wave  tuning. B - variable oscillation circuits for showing electric wave  tuning.]    Tuning forks are made with adjustable weights on their prongs and by  fixing these to different parts of them the frequency with which the  forks vibrate can be changed since the frequency varies inversely with  the square of the length and directly with the thickness [Footnote:  This law is for forks having a rectangular cross-section. Those having  a round cross-section vary as the radius.] of the prongs. Now by  adjusting one of the forks so that it vibrates at a frequency of, say,  16 per second and adjusting the other fork so that it vibrates at a  frequency of, say, 18 or 20 per second, then the forks will not be in  tune with each other and, hence, if you strike one of them the other  will not respond. But if you make the forks vibrate at the same  frequency, say 16, 20 or 24 per second, when you strike one of them  the other will vibrate in unison with it.    About Electric Tuning.--Electric resonance and electric tuning are  very like those of acoustic resonance and acoustic tuning which I have  just described. Just as acoustic resonance may be simple or  sympathetic so electric resonance may be simple or sympathetic. Simple  acoustic resonance is the direct reinforcement of a simple vibration  and this condition is had when a tuning fork is mounted on a sounding  box. In simple electric resonance an oscillating current of a given  frequency flowing in a circuit having the proper inductance and  capacitance may increase the voltage until it is several times greater  than its normal value. Tuning the receptor circuits to the transmitter  circuits are examples of sympathetic electric resonance. As a  demonstration if you have two Leyden jars (capacitance) connected in  circuit with two loops of wire (inductance) whose inductance can be  varied as shown at B in Fig. 36, when you make a spark pass between  the knobs of one of them by means of a spark coil then a spark will  pass in the gap of the other one provided the inductance of the two  loops of wire is the same. But if you vary the inductance of the one  loop so that it is larger or smaller than that of the other loop no  spark will take place in the second circuit.    When a tuning fork is made to vibrate it sends out waves in the air,  or sound waves, in all directions and just so when high frequency  currents surge in an oscillation circuit they send out waves in the  ether, or electric waves, that travel in all directions. For this  reason electric waves from a transmitting station cannot be sent to  one particular station, though they do go further in one direction  than in another, according to the way your aerial wire points.    Since the electric waves travel out in all directions any receiving  set properly tuned to the wave length of the sending station will  receive the waves and the only limit on your ability to receive from  high-power stations throughout the world depends entirely on the wave  length and sensitivity of your receiving set. As for tuning, just as  changing the length and the thickness of the prongs of a tuning fork  varies the frequency with which it vibrates and, hence, the length of  the waves it sends out, so, too, by varying the capacitance of the  condenser and the inductance of the tuning coil of the transmitter the  frequency of the electric oscillations set up in the circuit may be  changed and, consequently, the length of the electric waves they send  out. Likewise, by varying the capacitance and the inductance of the  receptor the circuits can be tuned to receive incoming electric waves  of whatever length within the limitation of the apparatus.          CHAPTER VIII    A SIMPLE VACUUM TUBE DETECTOR RECEIVING SET      While you can receive dots and dashes from spark wireless telegraph  stations and hear spoken words and music from wireless telephone  stations with a crystal detector receiving set such as described in  Chapter III, you can get stations that are much farther away and hear  them better with a _vacuum tube detector_ receiving set.    Though the vacuum tube detector requires two batteries to operate it  and the receiving circuits are somewhat more complicated than where a  crystal detector is used still the former does not have to be  constantly adjusted as does the latter and this is another very great  advantage. Taken all in all the vacuum tube detector is the most  sensitive and the most"]]]
