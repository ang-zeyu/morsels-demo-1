Harold was  infatuated by Booth as a woman by a soldier. He copied his gait and  tone, adopted his opinions, and was unhappy out of his society. Booth  gave him money, mysteriously obtained, and together they made the  acquaintance of young John Surratt, son of the conspiratress.    Young Surratt does not appear to have been a puissant spirit in the  scheme; indeed, all design and influence therein was absorbed by Mrs.  Surratt and Booth. The latter was the head and heart of the plot; Mrs.  Surratt was his anchor, and the rest of the boys were disciples to  Iscariot and Jezebel. John Surratt, a youth of strong Southern  physiognomy, beardless and lanky, knew of the murder and connived at it.  \"Sam\" Arnold and one McLaughlin were to have been parties to it, but  backed out in the end. They all relied upon Mrs. Surratt, and took their  \"cues\" from Wilkes Booth.    The conspiracy had its own time and kept its own counsel. Murder except  among the principals, was seldom mentioned except by genteel  implication. But they all publicly agreed that Mr. Lincoln ought to be  shot, and that the North was a race of fratricides. Much was said of  Brutus, and Booth repeated heroic passages to the delight of Harold, who  learned them also, and wondered if he was not born to greatness.    In this growing darkness, where all rehearsed cold-hearted murder,  Wilkes Booth grew great of stature. He had found a purpose consonant  with his evil nature and bad influence over weak men; so he grew  moodier, more vigilant, more plausible. By mien and temperament he was  born to handle a stiletto. We have no face so markedly Italian; it would  stand for Caesar Borgia any day in the year. All the rest were swayed or  persuaded by Booth; his schemes were three in order:    1st. To kidnap the President and Cabinet, and run them South or blow  them up.    2d. Kidnapping failed, to murder the President and the rest and seek  shelter in the confederate capital.    3d. The rebellion failed, to be its avenger, and throw the country into  consternation, while he escaped by the unfrequented parts of Maryland.    When this last resolution had been made, the plot was both contracted  and extended. There were made two distinct circles of confidants--those  aware of the meditated murder, and those who might shrink from murder,  though willing accessories for a lesser object. Two colleagues for blood  were at once accepted--Payne and Atzerott.    The former I have sketched; he is believed to have visited Washington  once before, at Booth's citation; for the murder was at first fixed for  the day of inauguration. Atzerott was a fellow of German descent, who  had led a desperate life at Port Tobacco, where he was a house-painter.  He had been a blockade-runner across the Potomac, and a mail-carrier.  When Booth and Mrs. Surratt broke the design to him, with a suggestion  that there was wealth in it, he embraced the offer at once, and bought a  dirk and pistol. Payne also came from the North to Washington, and, as  fate would have it, the President was announced to appear at Ford's  theater in public. There the resolve of blood was reduced to a definite  moment.    On the night before the crime Booth found on whom he could rely. John  Surratt was sent northward by his mother on Thursday. Sam Arnold and  McLaughlin, each of whom was to kill a cabinet officer, grew  pigeon-livered and ran away. Harold true to his partiality, lingered  around Booth to the end; Atzerott went so far as to take his knife and  pistol to Kirkwood's, where President Johnson was stopping, and hid them  under the bed. But either his courage failed, or a trifling accident  deranged his plan. But Payne, a professional murderer, stood \"game,\" and  fought his way over prostrate figures to his sick victim's bed. There  was great confusion and terror among the tacit and rash conspirators on  Thursday night. They had looked upon the plot as of a melodrama, and  found to their horror that John Wilkes Booth meant to do murder.    Six weeks before the murder, young John Surratt had taken two splendid  repeating carbines to Surrattville and told John Lloyd to secret them.    The latter made a hole in the wainscotting and suspended them from  strings, so that they fell within the plastered wall of the room below.  On the very afternoon of the murder, Mrs. Surratt was driven to  Surrattsville, and she told John Lloyd to have the carbines ready  because they would be called for that night. Harold was made  quartermaster, and hired the horses. He and Atzerott were mounted  between 8 o'clock and the time of the murder, and riding about the  streets together.    The whole party was prepared for a long ride, as their spurs and  gauntlets show. It may have been their design to ride in company to the  Lower Potomac, and by their numbers exact subsistence and  transportation; but all edifices of murder lack a corner stone. We only  know that Booth ate and talked well during the day; that he never seemed  so deeply involved in 'oil,' and that there is a hiatus between his  supper here and his appearance at Ford's theater.    Lloyd, I may interpolate, ordered his wife a few days before the murder  to go on a visit to Allen's Fresh. She says she does not know why she  was so sent away, but swears that it is so. Harold, three weeks before  the murder, visited Port Tobacco, and said that the next time the boys  heard of him he would be in Spain; he added that with Spain there was no  extradition treaty. He said at Surrattsville that he meant to make a  barrel of money, or his neck would stretch.    Atzerott said that if he ever came to Port Tobacco again he would be  rich enough to buy the whole place.    Wilkes Booth told a friend to go to Ford's on Friday night and see the  best acting in the world.    At Ford's theater, on Friday night, there were many standers in the  neighborhood of the door, and along the dress circle in the direction of  the private box where the President sat.    The play went on pleasantly, though Mr. Wilkes Booth an observer of the  audience, visited the stage and took note of the positions. His alleged  associate, the stage carpenter, then received quiet orders to clear the  passage by the wings from the prompter's post to the stage door. All  this time, Mr. Lincoln, in his family circle, unconscious of the death  that crowded fast upon him, watched the pleasantry and smiled and felt  heartful of gentleness.    Suddenly there was a murmur near the audience door, as of a man speaking  above his bound. He said:    \"Nine o'clock and forty-five minutes!\"    These words were reiterated from mouth to mouth until they passed the  theater door, and were heard upon the sidewalk.    Directly a voice cried, in the same slightly-raised monotone:    \"Nine o'clock and fifty minutes!\"    This also passed from man to man, until it touched the street like a  shudder.    \"Nine o'clock and fifty-five minutes!\" said the same relentless voice,  after the next interval, each of which narrowed to a lesser span the  life of the good President.    Ten o'clock here sounded, and conspiring echo said in reverberation:    \"Ten o'clock!\"    So like a creeping thing, from lip to lip, went:    \"Ten o'clock and five minutes.\"    (An interval.)    \"Ten o'clock and ten minutes!\"    At this instant Wilkes Booth appeared in the door of the theater, and  the men who had repeated the time so faithfully and so ominously  scattered at his coming, as at some warning phantom. Fifteen minutes  afterwards the telegraph wires were cut.    All this is so dramatic that I fear to excite a laugh when I write it.  But it is true and proven, and I do not say it but report it.    All evil deeds go wrong. While the click of the pistol, taking the  President's life, went like a pang through the theater, Payne was  spilling blood in Mr. Seward's house from threshold to sick chamber. But  Booth's broken leg delayed him or made him lose his general calmness and  he and Harold left Payne no to his fate.    I have not adverted to the hole bored with a gimlet in the entry door of  Mr. Lincoln's box, and cut out with a penknife. The theory that the  pistol-ball of Booth passed through this hole is exploded. And the stage  carpenter may have to answer for this little orifice with all his neck.  For when Booth leaped from the box he strode straight across the stage  by the footlights, reaching the prompter's post, which is immediately  behind that private box opposite Mr. Lincoln. From this box to the stage  door in the rear, the passage-way leads behind the ends of the scenes,  and if generally either closest up by one or more withdrawn scenes, or  so narrow that only by doubling and turning sidewise can one pass along.  On this fearful night, however, the scenes were so adjusted to the  murderer's design that he had a free aisle from the foot of the stage to  the exit door.    Within fifteen minutes after the murder the wires were severed entirely  around the city, excepting only a secret wire for government uses, which  leads to Old Point. I am told that by this wire the government reached  the fortifications around Washington, first telegraphing all the way to  Old Point, and then back to the outlying forts. This information comes  to me from so many creditable channels that I must concede it.    Payne, having, as he thought, made an end of Mr. Seward--which would  have been the case but for Robinson, the nurse--mounted his horse, and  attempted to find. Booth. But the town was in alarm, and he galloped at  once for the open country, taking as he imagined, the proper road for  the East Branch. He rode at a killing pace, and when near Fort Lincoln,  on the Baltimore pike, his horse threw him headlong. Afoot and  bewildered, he resolved to return to the city, whose lights he could  plainly see; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#14)"],[1,"in those of a  spiral configuration, whatever may be its situation with respect to  the grand Nebula of Andromeda, or the ``ring'' and ``planetary''  nebulae. Some other hypothesis more consonant with the appearances must  be found. Among the many that have been proposed the most elaborate is  the ``Planetesimal Hypothesis'' of Professors Chamberlin and Moulton.  It is to be remarked that it applies to the spiral nebulae  distinctively, and not to an apparently chaotic mass of gas like the  vast luminous cloud in Orion. The gist of the theory is that these  curious objects are probably the result of close approaches to each  other of two independent suns, reminding us of what was said on this  subject when we were dealing with temporary stars. Of the previous  history of these appulsing suns the theory gives us no account; they  are simply supposed to arrive within what may be called an effective  tide-producing distance, and then the drama begins. Some of the  probable consequences of such an approach have been noticed in Chapter  5; let us now consider them a little more in detail.    Tides always go in couples; if there is a tide on one side of a globe  there will be a corresponding tide on the other side. The cause is to  be found in the law that the force of gravitation varies inversely as  the square of the distance; the attraction on the nearest surface of  the body exercised by another body is greater than on its center, and  greater yet than on its opposite surface. If two great globes attract  each other, each tends to draw the other out into an ellipsoidal  figure; they must be more rigid than steel to resist this -- and even  then they cannot altogether resist. If they are liquid or gaseous they  will yield readily to the force of distortion, the amount of which  will depend upon their distance apart, for the nearer they are the  greater becomes the tidal strain. If they are encrusted without and  liquid or gaseous in the interior, the internal mass will strive to  assume the figure demanded by the tidal force, and will, if it can,  burst the restraining envelope. Now this is virtually the predicament  of the body we call a sun when in the immediate presence of another  body of similarly great mass. Such a body is presumably gaseous  throughout, the component gases being held in a state of rigidity by  the compression produced by the tremendous gravitational force of  their own aggregate mass. At the surface such a body is enveloped in a  shell of relatively cool matter. Now suppose a great attracting body,  such as another sun, to approach near enough for the difference in its  attraction on the two opposite sides of the body and on its center to  become very great; the consequence will be a tidal deformation of the  whole body, and it will lengthen out along the line of the  gravitational pull and draw in at the sides, and if its shell offers  considerable resistance, but not enough to exercise a complete  restraint, it will be violently burst apart, or blown to atoms, and  the internal mass will leap out on the two opposite sides in great  fiery spouts. In the case of a sun further advanced in cooling than  ours the interior might be composed of molten matter while the  exterior crust had become rigid like the shell of an egg; then the  force of the ``tidal explosion'' produced by the appulse of another  sun would be more violent in consequence of the greater resistance  overcome. Such, then, is the mechanism of the first phase in the  history of a spiral nebula according to the Planetesimal Hypothesis.  Two suns, perhaps extinguished ones, have drawn near together, and an  explosive outburst has occured in one or both. The second phase calls  for a more agile exercise of the imagination.    To simplify the case, let us suppose that only one of the tugging suns  is seriously affected by the strain. Its vast wings produced by the  outburst are twisted into spirals by their rotation and the contending  attractions exercised upon them, as the two suns, like battleships in  desperate conflict, curve round each other, concentrating their  destructive energies. Then immense quantities of debris are scattered  about in which eddies are created, and finally, as the sun that caused  the damage goes on its way, leaving its victim to repair its injuries  as it may, the dispersed matter cools, condenses, and turns into  streams of solid particles circling in elliptical paths about their  parent sun. These particles, or fragments, are the ``planetesimals''  of the theory. In consequence of the inevitable intersection of the  orbits of the planetesimals, nodes are formed where the flying  particles meet, and at these nodes large masses are gradually  accumulated. The larger the mass the greater its attraction, and at  last the nodal points become the nuclei of great aggregations from  which planets are shaped.    This, in very brief form, is the Planetesimal Hypothesis which we are  asked to substitute for that based on Laplace's suggestion as an  explanation of the mode of origin of the solar system; and the  phenomena of the spiral nebulae are appealed to as offering evident  support to the new hypothesis. We are reminded that they are  elliptical in outline, which accords with the hypothesis; that their  spectra are not gaseous, which shows that they may be composed of  solid particles like the planetesimals; and that their central masses  present an oval form, which is what would result from the tidal  effects, as just described. We also remember that some of them, like  the Lord Rosse and the Andromeda nebulae, are visually double, and in  these cases we might suppose that the two masses represent the  tide-burst suns that ventured into too close proximity. It may be  added that the authors of the theory do not insist upon the appulse of  two suns as the only way in which the planetesimals may have  originated, but it is the only supposition that has been worked out.    But serious questions remain. It needs, for instance, but a glance at  the Triangulum monster to convince the observer that it cannot be a  solar system which is being evolved there, but rather a swarm of  stars. Many of the detached masses are too vast to admit of the  supposition that they are to be transformed into planets, in our sense  of planets, and the distances of the stars which appear to have been  originally ejected from the focal masses are too great to allow us to  liken the assemblage that they form to a solar system. Then, too, no  nodes such as the hypothesis calls for are visible. Moreover, in most  of the spiral nebulae the appearances favor the view that the  supposititious encountering suns have not separated and gone each  rejoicing on its way, after having inflicted the maximum possible  damage on its opponent, but that, on the contrary, they remain in  close association like two wrestlers who cannot escape from each  other's grasp. And this is exactly what the law of gravitation  demands; stars cannot approach one another with impunity, with regard  either to their physical make-up or their future independence of  movement. The theory undertakes to avoid this difficulty by assuming  that in the case of our system the approach of the foreign body to the  sun was not a close one -- just close enough to produce the tidal  extrusion of the relatively insignificant quantity of matter needed to  form the planets. But even then the effect of the appulse would be to  change the direction of flight, both of the sun and of its visitor,  and there is no known star in the sky which can be selected as the  sun's probable partner in their ancient pas deux. That there are  unconquered difficulties in Laplace's hypothesis no one would deny,  but in simplicity of conception it is incomparably more satisfactory,  and with proper modifications could probably be made more consonant  with existing facts in our solar system than that which is offered to  replace it. Even as an explanation of the spiral nebulae, not as solar  systems in process of formation, but as the birthplaces of stellar  clusters, the Planetesimal Hypothesis would be open to many  objections. Granting its assumptions, it has undoubtedly a strong  mathematical framework, but the trouble is not with the mathematics  but with the assumptions. Laplace was one of the ablest mathematicians  that ever lived, but he had never seen a spiral nebula; if he had, he  might have invented a hypothesis to suit its phenomena. His actual  hypothesis was intended only for our solar system, and he left it in  the form of a ``note'' for the consideration of his successors, with  the hope that they might be able to discover the full truth, which he  confessed was hidden from him. It cannot be said that that truth has  yet been found, and when it is found the chances are that intuition  and not logic will have led to it.    The spiral nebulae, then, remain among the greatest riddles of the  universe, while the gaseous nebulae, like that of Orion, are no less  mysterious, although it seems impossible to doubt that both forms give  birth to stars. It is but natural to look to them for light on the  question of the origin of our planetary system; but we should not  forget that the scale of the phenomena in the two cases is vastly  different, and the forces in operation may be equally different. A  hill may have been built up by a glacier, while a mountain may be the  product of volcanic forces or of the upheaval of the strata of the  planet.    The Banners of the Sun    As all the world knows, the sun, a blinding globe pouring forth an  inconceivable quantity of light and heat, whose daily passage through  the sky is caused by the earth's rotation on its axis, constitutes the  most important phenomenon of terrestial existence. Viewed with a dark  glass to take off the glare, or with a telescope, its rim is seen to  be a sharp and smooth circle, and nothing but dark sky is visible  around "]]]
