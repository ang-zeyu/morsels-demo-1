Then Robin stepped to the edge of the scaffold, while the people grew  still as death; for they desired to hear the last words uttered to the  victims. But Robin's voice did not quaver forth weakly, as formerly,  and his figure had stiffened bolt upright beneath the black robe that  covered his rags.    \"Hark ye, proud Sheriff!\" he cried. \"I was ne'er a hangman in all my  life, nor do I now intend to begin that trade. Accurst be he who first  set the fashion of hanging! I have but three more words to say. Listen  to them!\"    And forth from the robe he drew his horn and blew three loud blasts  thereon. Then his keen hunting-knife flew forth and in a trice, Stout  Will, Lester, and merry John were free men and had sprung forward and  seized the halberds from the nearest soldiers guarding the gallows.    \"Seize them! 'Tis Robin Hood!\" screamed the Sheriff, \"an hundred pounds  if ye hold them, dead or alive!\"    \"I make it two hundred!\" roared the fat Bishop.    But their voices were drowned in the uproar that ensued immediately  after Robin blew his horn. He himself had drawn his sword and leaped  down the stairs from the scaffold, followed by his three men. The guard  had closed around them in vain effort to disarm them, when \"A rescuer\"  shouted Will Stutely's clear voice on one side of them, and \"A  rescue!\" bellowed Little John's on the other; and down through the  terror-stricken crowd rushed fourscore men in Lincoln green, their force  seeming twice that number in the confusion. With swords drawn they fell  upon the guard from every side at once. There was a brief clash of hot  weapons, then the guard scattered wildly, and Robin Hood's men formed in  a compact mass around their leader and forced their way slowly down the  market-place.    \"Seize them! In the King's name!\" shrieked the Sheriff. \"Close the  gates!\"    In truth, the peril would have been even greater, had this last order  been carried out. But Will Scarlet and Allan-a-Dale had foreseen that  event, and had already overpowered the two warders.    So the gates stood wide open, and toward them the band of outlaws  headed.    The soldiers rallied a force of twice their number and tried resolutely  to pierce their center. But the retreating force turned thrice and sent  such volleys of keen arrows from their good yew bows, that they kept a  distance between the two forces.    And thus the gate was reached, and the long road leading up the hill,  and at last the protecting greenwood itself. The soldiers dared come no  farther. And the widow's three sons, I warrant you, supped more heartily  that night than ever before in their whole lives.          CHAPTER X    HOW A BEGGAR FILLED THE PUBLIC EYE         Good Robin accost him in his way,       To see what he might be;       If any beggar had money,       He thought some part had he.    One bright morning, soon after the stirring events told in the last  chapter, Robin wandered forth alone down the road to Barnesdale, to see  if aught had come of the Sheriff's pursuit. But all was still and  serene and peaceful. No one was in sight save a solitary beggar who came  sturdily along his way in Robin's direction. The beggar caught sight  of Robin, at the same moment, as he emerged from the trees, but gave no  sign of having seen him. He neither slackened nor quickened his pace,  but jogged forward merrily, whistling as he came, and beating time by  punching holes in the dusty road with the stout pike-staff in his hand.    The curious look of the fellow arrested Robin's attention, and he  decided to stop and talk with him. The fellow was bare-legged and  bare-armed, and wore a long shift of a shirt, fastened with a belt.  About his neck hung a stout, bulging bag, which was buckled by a good  piece of leather thong.         He had three hats upon his head,       Together sticked fast,       He cared neither for the wind nor wet,       In lands where'er he past.    The fellow looked so fat and hearty, and the wallet on his shoulder  seemed so well filled, that Robin thought within himself,    \"Ha! this is a lucky beggar for me! If any of them have money, this is  the chap, and, marry, he should share it with us poorer bodies.\"    So he flourished his own stick and planted himself in the traveler's  path.    \"Sirrah, fellow!\" quoth he; \"whither away so fast? Tarry, for I would  have speech with ye!\"    The beggar made as though he heard him not, and kept straight on with  his faring.    \"Tarry, I say, fellow!\" said Robin again; \"for there's a way to make  folks obey!\"    \"Nay, 'tis not so,\" answered the beggar, speaking for the first time; \"I  obey no man in all England, not even the King himself. So let me pass on  my way, for 'tis growing late, and I have still far to go before I can  care for my stomach's good.\"    \"Now, by my troth,\" said Robin, once more getting in front of the other,  \"I see well by your fat countenance, that you lack not for good food,  while I go hungry. Therefore you must lend me of your means till we meet  again, so that I may hie to the nearest tavern.\"    \"I have no money to lend,\" said the beggar crossly. \"Methinks you are as  young a man as I, and as well able to earn a supper. So go your way, and  I'll go mine. If you fast till you get aught out of me, you'll go hungry  for the next twelvemonth.\"    \"Not while I have a stout stick to thwack your saucy bones!\" cried  Robin. \"Stand and deliver, I say, or I'll dust your shirt for you; and  if that will not teach you manners, then we'll see what a broad arrow  can do with a beggar's skin!\"    The beggar smiled, and answered boast with boast. \"Come on with your  staff, fellow! I care no more for it than for a pudding stick. And as  for your pretty bow--_that_ for it!\"    And with amazing quickness, he swung his pike-staff around and knocked  Robin's bow clean out of his hand, so that his fingers smarted with  pain. Robin danced and tried to bring his own staff into action; but  the beggar never gave him a chance. Biff! whack! came the pike-staff,  smiting him soundly and beating down his guard.    There were but two things to do; either stand there and take a sound  drubbing, or beat a hasty retreat. Robin chose the latter--as you or I  would probably have done--and scurried back into the wood, blowing his  horn as he went.    \"Fie, for shame, man!\" jeered the bold beggar after him. \"What is your  haste? We had but just begun. Stay and take your money, else you will  never be able to pay your reckoning at the tavern!\"    But Robin answered him never a word. He fled up hill and down dale till  he met three of his men who were running up in answer to his summons.    \"What is wrong?\" they asked.    \"'Tis a saucy beggar,\" said Robin, catching his breath. \"He is back  there on the highroad with the hardest stick I've met in a good many  days. He gave me no chance to reason with him, the dirty scamp!\"    The men--Much and two of the widow's sons--could scarce conceal their  mirth at the thought of Robin Hood running from a beggar. Nathless, they  kept grave faces, and asked their leader if he was hurt.    \"Nay,\" he replied, \"but I shall speedily feel better if you will fetch  me that same beggar and let me have a fair chance at him.\"    So the three yeomen made haste and came out upon the highroad and  followed after the beggar, who was going smoothly along his way again,  as though he were at peace with all the world.    \"The easiest way to settle this beggar,\" said Much, \"is to surprise  him. Let us cut through yon neck of woods and come upon him before he is  aware.\"    The others agreed to this, and the three were soon close upon their  prey.    \"Now!\" quoth Much; and the other two sprang quickly upon the beggar's  back and wrested his pike-staff from his hand. At the same moment Much  drew his dagger and flashed it before the fellow's breast.    \"Yield you, my man!\" cried he; \"for a friend of ours awaits you in the  wood, to teach you how to fight properly.\"    \"Give me a fair chance,\" said the beggar valiantly, \"and I'll fight you  all at once.\"    But they would not listen to him. Instead, they turned him about and  began to march him toward the forest. Seeing that it was useless to  struggle, the beggar began to parley.    \"Good my masters,\" quoth he, \"why use this violence? I will go with ye  safe and quietly, if ye insist, but if ye will set me free I'll make  it worth your while. I've a hundred pounds in my bag here. Let me go my  way, and ye shall have all that's in the bag.\"    The three outlaws took council together at this.    \"What say you?\" asked Much of the others. \"Our master will be more glad  to see this beggar's wallet than his sorry face.\"    The other two agreed, and the little party came to a halt and loosed  hold of the beggar.    \"Count out your gold speedily, friend,\" said Much. There was a brisk  wind blowing, and the beggar turned about to face it, directly they had  unhanded him.    \"It shall be done, gossips,\" said he. \"One of you lend me your cloak and  we will spread it upon the ground and put the wealth upon it.\"    The cloak was handed him, and he placed his wallet upon it as though  it were very heavy indeed. Then he crouched down and fumbled with  the leather fastenings. The outlaws also bent over and watched the  proceeding closely, lest he should hide some of the money on his person.  Presently he got the bag unfastened and plunged his hands into it. Forth  from it he drew--not shining gold--but handfuls of fine meal which he  dashed into the eager faces of the men around him. The wind aided him  in this, and soon there arose a blinding cloud which filled the eyes,  noses, and mouths of the three outlaws till they could scarcely see or  breathe.    While they gasped and choked and sputtered and felt around wildly for  that rogue of a beggar, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#14)"],[1,"dle, heartily. 'I'm delighted to be able to  give any little pleasure to you dear children.'    And she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it away  between them.    'You ARE a dear,' said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other  heartily.      'WELL!' said Cyril as they went along the street.    'Yes,' said Robert, 'and the odd part is that you feel just as if it  was REAL--her being so jolly, I mean--and not only the carpet making her  nice.'    'Perhaps it IS real,' said Anthea, 'only it was covered up with  crossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.'    'I hope it'll keep them away,' said Jane; 'she isn't ugly at all when  she laughs.'    The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs  Biddle is, I think, the most wonderful. For from that day she was never  anything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent a lovely  silver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady  married the nice curate; just after Easter it was, and they went to  Italy for their honeymoon.        CHAPTER 5. THE TEMPLE      'I wish we could find the Phoenix,' said Jane. 'It's much better company  than the carpet.'    'Beastly ungrateful, little kids are,' said Cyril.    'No, I'm not; only the carpet never says anything, and it's so helpless.  It doesn't seem able to take care of itself. It gets sold, and taken  into the sea, and things like that. You wouldn't catch the Phoenix  getting sold.'    It was two days after the bazaar. Every one was a little cross--some  days are like that, usually Mondays, by the way. And this was a Monday.    'I shouldn't wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good,'  said Cyril; 'and I don't know that I blame it. Look at the weather!'    'It's not worth looking at,' said Robert. And indeed it wasn't.    'The Phoenix hasn't gone--I'm sure it hasn't,' said Anthea. 'I'll have  another look for it.'    Anthea looked under tables and chairs, and in boxes and baskets, in  mother's work-bag and father's portmanteau, but still the Phoenix showed  not so much as the tip of one shining feather.    Then suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation  song of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English  hexameter, so he stood on the carpet and chanted--      'Oh, come along, come along, you good old beautiful Phoenix,'    and almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs,  and the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings.    'Where on earth HAVE you been?' asked Anthea. 'I've looked everywhere  for you.'    'Not EVERYWHERE,' replied the bird, 'because you did not look in the  place where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by  you.'    'WHAT hallowed spot?' asked Cyril, a little impatiently, for time was  hastening on, and the wishing carpet still idle.    'The spot,' said the Phoenix, 'which I hallowed by my golden presence  was the Lutron.'    'The WHAT?'    'The bath--the place of washing.'    'I'm sure you weren't,' said Jane. 'I looked there three times and moved  all the towels.'    'I was concealed,' said the Phoenix, 'on the summit of a metal  column--enchanted, I should judge, for it felt warm to my golden toes,  as though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it.'    'Oh, you mean the cylinder,' said Cyril: 'it HAS rather a comforting  feel, this weather. And now where shall we go?'    And then, of course, the usual discussion broke out as to where they  should go and what they should do. And naturally, every one wanted to do  something that the others did not care about.    'I am the eldest,' Cyril remarked, 'let's go to the North Pole.'    'This weather! Likely!' Robert rejoined. 'Let's go to the Equator.'    'I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice,' said Anthea;  'don't you agree, Jane?'    'No, I don't,' retorted Jane, 'I don't agree with you. I don't agree  with anybody.'    The Phoenix raised a warning claw.    'If you cannot agree among yourselves, I fear I shall have to leave  you,' it said.    'Well, where shall we go? You decide!' said all.    'If I were you,' said the bird, thoughtfully, 'I should give the carpet  a rest. Besides, you'll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere  by carpet. Can't you take me out and explain your ugly city to me?'    'We will if it clears up,' said Robert, without enthusiasm. 'Just look  at the rain. And why should we give the carpet a rest?'    'Are you greedy and grasping, and heartless and selfish?' asked the  bird, sharply.    'NO!' said Robert, with indignation.    'Well then!' said the Phoenix. 'And as to the rain--well, I am not fond  of rain myself. If the sun knew _I_ was here--he's very fond of shining  on me because I look so bright and golden. He always says I repay a  little attention. Haven't you some form of words suitable for use in wet  weather?'    'There's \"Rain, rain, go away,\"' said Anthea; 'but it never DOES go.'    'Perhaps you don't say the invocation properly,' said the bird.         'Rain, rain, go away,       Come again another day,       Little baby wants to play,'    said Anthea.    'That's quite wrong; and if you say it in that sort of dull way, I can  quite understand the rain not taking any notice. You should open the  window and shout as loud as you can--         'Rain, rain, go away,       Come again another day;       Now we want the sun, and so,       Pretty rain, be kind and go!    'You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do  things, and especially when it's going away that you want them to do.  And to-day you might add--         'Shine, great sun, the lovely Phoe-       Nix is here, and wants to be       Shone on, splendid sun, by thee!'    'That's poetry!' said Cyril, decidedly.    'It's like it,' said the more cautious Robert.    'I was obliged to put in \"lovely\",' said the Phoenix, modestly, 'to make  the line long enough.'    'There are plenty of nasty words just that length,' said Jane; but every  one else said 'Hush!' And then they opened the window and shouted the  seven lines as loud as they could, and the Phoenix said all the words  with them, except 'lovely', and when they came to that it looked down  and coughed bashfully.    The rain hesitated a moment and then went away.    'There's true politeness,' said the Phoenix, and the next moment it was  perched on the window-ledge, opening and shutting its radiant wings and  flapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as  you sometimes have at sunset in autumn time. People said afterwards that  there had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and  years.    'And now,' said the bird, 'we will go out into the city, and you shall  take me to see one of my temples.'    'Your temples?'    'I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land.'    'I don't see how you CAN find anything out from it,' said Jane: 'it  never speaks.'    'All the same, you can pick up things from a carpet,' said the bird;  'I've seen YOU do it. And I have picked up several pieces of information  in this way. That papyrus on which you showed me my picture--I  understand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in  which my finest temple stands, with my image graved in stone and in  metal over against its portal.'    'You mean the fire insurance office,' said Robert. 'It's not really a  temple, and they don't--'    'Excuse me,' said the Phoenix, coldly, 'you are wholly misinformed. It  IS a temple, and they do.'    'Don't let's waste the sunshine,' said Anthea; 'we might argue as we go  along, to save time.'    So the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Robert's  Norfolk jacket, and they all went out into the splendid sunshine. The  best way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram, and  on the top of it the children talked, while the Phoenix now and then  put out a wary beak, cocked a cautious eye, and contradicted what the  children were saying.    It was a delicious ride, and the children felt how lucky they were to  have had the money to pay for it. They went with the tram as far as it  went, and when it did not go any farther they stopped too, and got off.  The tram stops at the end of the Gray's Inn Road, and it was Cyril  who thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office  through the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between  Fetter Lane and Ludgate Circus. Of course, he was quite mistaken, as  Robert told him at the time, and afterwards Robert did not forbear to  remind his brother how he had said so. The streets there were small  and stuffy and ugly, and crowded with printers' boys and binders' girls  coming out from work; and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats  and caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way.  And the printers and binders made very personal remarks, advising Jane  to get her hair cut, and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat.  Jane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they  were hardly a match for the rough crowd. They could think of nothing  nasty enough to say. They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea  pulled Jane into an archway, and then inside a door; Cyril and Robert  quickly followed, and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them.    Anthea drew a long breath.    'How awful!' she said. 'I didn't know there were such people, except in  books.'    'It was a bit thick; but it's partly you girls' fault, coming out in  those flashy coats.'    'We thought we ought to, when we were going out with the Phoenix,' said  Jane; and the bird said, 'Quite right, too'--and incautiously put out  his head to give her a wink of encouragement.    And at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade  of the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix, and a hoarse  voice said--    'I say, Urb, blowed if this ain't our"]]]
