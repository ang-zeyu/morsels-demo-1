Shortly before I embarked for the West, I sought him out and humbly  knelt for his farewell blessing:    \"Son, go to America. Take the dignity of hoary India for your  shield.  Victory is written on your brow; the noble distant people  will well receive you.\"    {FN7-1} Methods of controlling life-force through regulation of  breath.    {FN7-2} The foremost ancient exponent of yoga.    {FN7-3} French professors were the first in the West to be willing  to scientifically investigate the possibilities of the superconscious  mind. Professor Jules-Bois, member of the L'Ecole de Psychologie of  the Sorbonne, lectured in America in 1928; he told his audiences that  French scientists have accorded recognition to the superconsciousness,  \"which is the exact opposite of Freud's subconscious mind and is the  faculty which makes man really man and not just a super-animal.\" M.  Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the higher consciousness  \"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The existence  of a superconscious mind has long been recognized philosophically,  being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently  has it been recognized scientifically.\" The French scientist pointed  out that from the superconsciousness come inspiration, genius, moral  values.  \"Belief in this is not mysticism though it recognized and  valued the qualities which mystics preached.\"    {FN7-4} St. Theresa of Avila and other Christian saints were often  observed in a state of levitation.    {FN7-5} \"Great sage.\"    {FN7-6} Actual perception of God.    {FN7-7} The saint's full name was Nagendranath Bhaduri. MATH means  hermitage or ASHRAM.        CHAPTER: 8    INDIA'S GREAT SCIENTIST, J.C. BOSE    \"Jagadis Chandra Bose's wireless inventions antedated those of  Marconi.\"    Overhearing this provocative remark, I walked closer to a sidewalk  group of professors engaged in scientific discussion. If my motive  in joining them was racial pride, I regret it. I cannot deny my  keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading part in  physics, and not metaphysics alone.    \"What do you mean, sir?\"    The professor obligingly explained. \"Bose was the first one to invent  a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction  of electric waves. But the Indian scientist did not exploit his  inventions commercially. He soon turned his attention from the  inorganic to the organic world. His revolutionary discoveries as a  plant physiologist are outpacing even his radical achievements as  a physicist.\"    I politely thanked my mentor. He added, \"The great scientist is  one of my brother professors at Presidency College.\"    I paid a visit the next day to the sage at his home, which was close  to mine on Gurpar Road. I had long admired him from a respectful  distance. The grave and retiring botanist greeted me graciously. He  was a handsome, robust man in his fifties, with thick hair, broad  forehead, and the abstracted eyes of a dreamer. The precision in  his tones revealed the lifelong scientific habit.    \"I have recently returned from an expedition to scientific societies  of the West. Their members exhibited intense interest in delicate  instruments of my invention which demonstrate the indivisible unity  of all life. {FN8-1} The Bose crescograph has the enormity of ten  million magnifications. The microscope enlarges only a few thousand  times; yet it brought vital impetus to biological science. The  crescograph opens incalculable vistas.\"    \"You have done much, sir, to hasten the embrace of East and West  in the impersonal arms of science.\"    \"I was educated at Cambridge. How admirable is the Western method  of submitting all theory to scrupulous experimental verification!  That empirical procedure has gone hand in hand with the gift for  introspection which is my Eastern heritage. Together they have enabled  me to sunder the silences of natural realms long uncommunicative.  The telltale charts of my crescograph {FN8-2} are evidence for  the most skeptical that plants have a sensitive nervous system and  a varied emotional life. Love, hate, joy, fear, pleasure, pain,  excitability, stupor, and countless appropriate responses to stimuli  are as universal in plants as in animals.\"    \"The unique throb of life in all creation could seem only poetic  imagery before your advent, Professor! A saint I once knew would  never pluck flowers. 'Shall I rob the rosebush of its pride in  beauty? Shall I cruelly affront its dignity by my rude divestment?'  His sympathetic words are verified literally through your discoveries!\"    \"The poet is intimate with truth, while the scientist approaches  awkwardly. Come someday to my laboratory and see the unequivocable  testimony of the crescograph.\"    Gratefully I accepted the invitation, and took my departure. I  heard later that the botanist had left Presidency College, and was  planning a research center in Calcutta.    When the Bose Institute was opened, I attended the dedicatory  services. Enthusiastic hundreds strolled over the premises. I was  charmed with the artistry and spiritual symbolism of the new home  of science. Its front gate, I noted, was a centuried relic from  a distant shrine. Behind the lotus {FN8-3} fountain, a sculptured  female figure with a torch conveyed the Indian respect for woman  as the immortal light-bearer. The garden held a small temple  consecrated to the Noumenon beyond phenomena. Thought of the divine  incorporeity was suggested by absence of any altar-image.    [Illustration: Myself at Age six--see atsix.jpg]    [Illustration: JAGADIS CHANDRA BOSE, India's great physicist,  botanist, and inventor of the Crescograph--see bose.jpg]    Bose's speech on this great occasion might have issued from the  lips of one of the inspired ancient RISHIS.    \"I dedicate today this Institute as not merely a laboratory but  a temple.\" His reverent solemnity stole like an unseen cloak over  the crowded auditorium. \"In the pursuit of my investigations I was  unconsciously led into the border region of physics and physiology.  To my amazement, I found boundary lines vanishing, and points  of contact emerging, between the realms of the living and the  non-living.  Inorganic matter was perceived as anything but inert;  it was athrill under the action of multitudinous forces.    \"A universal reaction seemed to bring metal, plant and animal under  a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same phenomena  of fatigue and depression, with possibilities of recovery and of  exaltation, as well as the permanent irresponsiveness associated  with death. Filled with awe at this stupendous generalization, it  was with great hope that I announced my results before the Royal  Society--results demonstrated by experiments. But the physiologists  present advised me to confine myself to physical investigations, in  which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their  preserves. I had unwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar  caste system and so offended its etiquette.    \"An unconscious theological bias was also present, which confounds  ignorance with faith. It is often forgotten that He who surrounded  us with this ever-evolving mystery of creation has also implanted  in us the desire to question and understand. Through many years  of miscomprehension, I came to know that the life of a devotee of  science is inevitably filled with unending struggle. It is for him  to cast his life as an ardent offering-regarding gain and loss,  success and failure, as one.    \"In time the leading scientific societies of the world accepted my  theories and results, and recognized the importance of the Indian  contribution to science. {FN8-4} Can anything small or circumscribed  ever satisfy the mind of India? By a continuous living tradition,  and a vital power of rejuvenescence, this land has readjusted itself  through unnumbered transformations. Indians have always arisen who,  discarding the immediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have  sought for the realization of the highest ideals in life-not through  passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling  who has refused the conflict, acquiring nothing, has had nothing  to renounce.  He alone who has striven and won can enrich the world  by bestowing the fruits of his victorious experience.    \"The work already carried out in the Bose laboratory on the  response of matter, and the unexpected revelations in plant life,  have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in physics, in  physiology, in medicine, in agriculture, and even in psychology.  Problems hitherto regarded as insoluble have now been brought within  the sphere of experimental investigation.    \"But high success is not to be obtained without rigid exactitude.  Hence the long battery of super-sensitive instruments and apparatus  of my design, which stand before you today in their cases in the  entrance hall. They tell you of the protracted efforts to get behind  the deceptive seeming into the reality that remains unseen, of the  continuous toil and persistence and resourcefulness called forth  to overcome human limitations. All creative scientists know that  the true laboratory is the mind, where behind illusions they uncover  the laws of truth.    \"The lectures given here will not be mere repetitions of second-hand  knowledge. They will announce new discoveries, demonstrated for  the first time in these halls. Through regular publication of the  work of the Institute, these Indian contributions will reach the  whole world.  They will become public property. No patents will  ever be taken. The spirit of our national culture demands that we  should forever be free from the desecration of utilizing knowledge  only for personal gain.    \"It is my further wish that the facilities of this Institute be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#14)"],[1,"it  seemed to me that this was where I got it. And I liked the boy. He was  the right sort.    The nurse, a very unpleasant woman, had to make objections.    'Master Peter! You can't take him home, a great, rough, fierce, common  dog! What would your mother say?'    'I'm going to take him home,' repeated the child, with a determination  which I heartily admired, 'and he's going to be my dog. I shall call  him Fido.'    There's always a catch in these good things. Fido is a name I  particularly detest. All dogs do. There was a dog called that that I  knew once, and he used to get awfully sick when we shouted it out after  him in the street. No doubt there have been respectable dogs called  Fido, but to my mind it is a name like Aubrey or Clarence. You may be  able to live it down, but you start handicapped. However, one must take  the rough with the smooth, and I was prepared to yield the point.    'If you wait, Master Peter, your father will buy you a beautiful,  lovely dog....'    'I don't want a beautiful, lovely dog. I want this dog.'    The slur did not wound me. I have no illusions about my looks. Mine is  an honest, but not a beautiful, face.    'It's no use talking,' said the chauffeur, grinning. 'He means to have  him. Shove him in, and let's be getting back, or they'll be thinking  His Nibs has been kidnapped.'    So I was carried to the car. I could have walked, but I had an idea  that I had better not. I had made my hit as a crippled dog, and a  crippled dog I intended to remain till things got more settled down.    The chauffeur started the car off again. What with the shock I had had  and the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I  could not say how far we went. But it must have been miles and miles,  for it seemed a long time afterwards that we stopped at the biggest  house I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and  men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right,  kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses  through the bars and shouting. They all wanted to know who I was and  what prizes I had won, and then I realized that I was moving in high  society.    I let the small boy pick me up and carry me into the house, though it  was all he could do, poor kid, for I was some weight. He staggered up  the steps and along a great hall, and then let me flop on the carpet of  the most beautiful room you ever saw. The carpet was a yard thick.    There was a woman sitting in a chair, and as soon as she saw me she  gave a shriek.    'I told Master Peter you would not be pleased, m'lady,' said the nurse,  who seemed to have taken a positive dislike to me, 'but he would bring  the nasty brute home.'    'He's not a nasty brute, mother. He's my dog, and his name's Fido. John  ran over him in the car, and I brought him home to live with us. I love  him.'    This seemed to make an impression. Peter's mother looked as if she were  weakening.    'But, Peter, dear, I don't know what your father will say. He's so  particular about dogs. All his dogs are prize-winners, pedigree dogs.  This is such a mongrel.'    'A nasty, rough, ugly, common dog, m'lady,' said the nurse, sticking  her oar in in an absolutely uncalled-for way.    Just then a man came into the room.    'What on earth?' he said, catching sight of me.    'It's a dog Peter has brought home. He says he wants to keep him.'    'I'm going to keep him,' corrected Peter firmly.    I do like a child that knows his own mind. I was getting fonder of  Peter every minute. I reached up and licked his hand.    'See! He knows he's my dog, don't you, Fido? He licked me.'    'But, Peter, he looks so fierce.' This, unfortunately, is true. I do  look fierce. It is rather a misfortune for a perfectly peaceful dog.  'I'm sure it's not safe your having him.'    'He's my dog, and his name's Fido. I am going to tell cook to give him  a bone.'    His mother looked at his father, who gave rather a nasty laugh.    'My dear Helen,' he said, 'ever since Peter was born, ten years ago, he  has not asked for a single thing, to the best of my recollection, which  he has not got. Let us be consistent. I don't approve of this  caricature of a dog, but if Peter wants him, I suppose he must have  him.'    'Very well. But the first sign of viciousness he shows, he shall be  shot. He makes me nervous.'    So they left it at that, and I went off with Peter to get my bone.    After lunch, he took me to the kennels to introduce me to the other  dogs. I had to go, but I knew it would not be pleasant, and it wasn't.  Any dog will tell you what these prize-ribbon dogs are like. Their  heads are so swelled they have to go into their kennels backwards.    It was just as I had expected. There were mastiffs, terriers, poodles,  spaniels, bulldogs, sheepdogs, and every other kind of dog you can  imagine, all prize-winners at a hundred shows, and every single dog in  the place just shoved his head back and laughed himself sick. I never  felt so small in my life, and I was glad when it was over and Peter  took me off to the stables.    I was just feeling that I never wanted to see another dog in my life,  when a terrier ran out, shouting. As soon as he saw me, he came up  inquiringly, walking very stiff-legged, as terriers do when they see a  stranger.    'Well,' I said, 'and what particular sort of a prize-winner are you?  Tell me all about the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal Palace, and  let's get it over.'    He laughed in a way that did me good.    'Guess again!' he said. 'Did you take me for one of the nuts in the  kennels? My name's Jack, and I belong to one of the grooms.'    'What!' I cried. 'You aren't Champion Bowlegs Royal or anything of that  sort! I'm glad to meet you.'    So we rubbed noses as friendly as you please. It was a treat meeting  one of one's own sort. I had had enough of those high-toned dogs who  look at you as if you were something the garbage-man had forgotten to  take away.    'So you've been talking to the swells, have you?' said Jack.    'He would take me,' I said, pointing to Peter.    'Oh, you're his latest, are you? Then you're all right--while it  lasts.'    'How do you mean, while it lasts?'    'Well, I'll tell you what happened to me. Young Peter took a great  fancy to me once. Couldn't do enough for me for a while. Then he got  tired of me, and out I went. You see, the trouble is that while he's a  perfectly good kid, he has always had everything he wanted since he was  born, and he gets tired of things pretty easy. It was a toy railway  that finished me. Directly he got that, I might not have been on the  earth. It was lucky for me that Dick, my present old man, happened to  want a dog to keep down the rats, or goodness knows what might not have  happened to me. They aren't keen on dogs here unless they've pulled  down enough blue ribbons to sink a ship, and mongrels like you and  me--no offence--don't last long. I expect you noticed that the  grown-ups didn't exactly cheer when you arrived?'    'They weren't chummy.'    'Well take it from me, your only chance is to make them chummy. If you  do something to please them, they might let you stay on, even though  Peter was tired of you.'    'What sort of thing?'    'That's for you to think out. I couldn't find one. I might tell you to  save Peter from drowning. You don't need a pedigree to do that. But you  can't drag the kid to the lake and push him in. That's the trouble. A  dog gets so few opportunities. But, take it from me, if you don't do  something within two weeks to make yourself solid with the adults, you  can make your will. In two weeks Peter will have forgotten all about  you. It's not his fault. It's the way he has been brought up. His  father has all the money on earth, and Peter's the only child. You  can't blame him. All I say is, look out for yourself. Well, I'm glad to  have met you. Drop in again when you can. I can give you some good  ratting, and I have a bone or two put away. So long.'           *       *       *       *       *    It worried me badly what Jack had said. I couldn't get it out of my  mind. If it hadn't been for that, I should have had a great time, for  Peter certainly made a lot of fuss of me. He treated me as if I were  the only friend he had.    And, in a way, I was. When you are the only son of a man who has all  the money in the world, it seems that you aren't allowed to be like an  ordinary kid. They coop you up, as if you were something precious that  would be contaminated by contact with other children. In all the time  that I was at the house I never met another child. Peter had everything  in the world, except someone of his own age to go round with; and that  made him different from any of the kids I had known.    He liked talking to me. I was the only person round who really  understood him. He would talk by the hour and I would listen with my  tongue hanging out and nod now and then.    It was worth listening to, what he used to tell me. He told me the most  surprising things. I didn't know, for instance, that there were any Red  Indians in England but he said there was a chief named Big Cloud who  lived in the rhododendron bushes by the lake. I never found him, though  I went carefully through them one day. He also said that there were  pirates on the island in the lake. I never saw them either.    What he liked telling me about best was the city of gold and precious  stones which you came to if you walked far enough through the woods at  the back of the stables. He was always meaning to go off there some  day, and, from the way he described it, I didn't blame him. It was  certainly a pretty good city. It was just right for dogs, too, he said,  having bones and liver and sweet cakes there and everything else a dog  could want. It used to make my mouth water to listen to him.    We were never apart. I was with him all day, and I slept on the mat in  his room at night. But"]]]
