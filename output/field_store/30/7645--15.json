The pictures still hung on  the walls. But she had gone. Everything was at home except his wife.    Finally, propped up against the cup he had once won in a handicap  competition, he saw a letter. With a sinking heart he tore open the  envelope.    It was a pathetic, a tragic letter, the letter of a woman endeavouring  to express all the anguish of a torn heart with one of those  fountain-pens which suspend the flow of ink about twice in every three  words. The gist of it was that she felt she had wronged him; that,  though he might forgive, he could never forget; and that she was going  away, away out into the world alone.    Mortimer sank into a chair, and stared blankly before him. She had  scratched the match.           *       *       *       *       *    I am not a married man myself, so have had no experience of how it  feels to have one's wife whizz off silently into the unknown; but I  should imagine that it must be something like taking a full swing with  a brassey and missing the ball. Something, I take it, of the same sense  of mingled shock, chagrin, and the feeling that nobody loves one, which  attacks a man in such circumstances, must come to the bereaved husband.  And one can readily understand how terribly the incident must have  shaken Mortimer Sturgis. I was away at the time, but I am told by those  who saw him that his game went all to pieces.    He had never shown much indication of becoming anything in the nature  of a first-class golfer, but he had managed to acquire one or two  decent shots. His work with the light iron was not at all bad, and he  was a fairly steady putter. But now, under the shadow of this tragedy,  he dropped right back to the form of his earliest period. It was a  pitiful sight to see this gaunt, haggard man with the look of dumb  anguish behind his spectacles taking as many as three shots sometimes  to get past the ladies' tee. His slice, of which he had almost cured  himself, returned with such virulence that in the list of ordinary  hazards he had now to include the tee-box. And, when he was not  slicing, he was pulling. I have heard that he was known, when driving  at the sixth, to get bunkered in his own caddie, who had taken up his  position directly behind him. As for the deep sand-trap in front of the  seventh green, he spent so much of his time in it that there was some  informal talk among the members of the committee of charging him a  small weekly rent.    A man of comfortable independent means, he lived during these days on  next to nothing. Golf-balls cost him a certain amount, but the bulk of  his income he spent in efforts to discover his wife's whereabouts. He  advertised in all the papers. He employed private detectives. He even,  much as it revolted his finer instincts, took to travelling about the  country, watching croquet matches. But she was never among the players.  I am not sure that he did not find a melancholy comfort in this, for it  seemed to show that, whatever his wife might be and whatever she might  be doing, she had not gone right under.    Summer passed. Autumn came and went. Winter arrived. The days grew  bleak and chill, and an early fall of snow, heavier than had been known  at that time of the year for a long while, put an end to golf. Mortimer  spent his days indoors, staring gloomily through the window at the  white mantle that covered the earth.    It was Christmas Eve.           *       *       *       *       *    The young man shifted uneasily on his seat. His face was long and  sombre.    \"All this is very depressing,\" he said.    \"These soul tragedies,\" agreed the Oldest Member, \"are never very  cheery.\"    \"Look here,\" said the young man, firmly, \"tell me one thing frankly, as  man to man. Did Mortimer find her dead in the snow, covered except for  her face, on which still lingered that faint, sweet smile which he  remembered so well? Because, if he did, I'm going home.\"    \"No, no,\" protested the Oldest Member. \"Nothing of that kind.\"    \"You're sure? You aren't going to spring it on me suddenly?\"    \"No, no!\"    The young man breathed a relieved sigh.    \"It was your saying that about the white mantle covering the earth that  made me suspicious.\"    The Sage resumed.           *       *       *       *       *    It was Christmas Eve. All day the snow had been falling, and now it lay  thick and deep over the countryside. Mortimer Sturgis, his frugal  dinner concluded--what with losing his wife and not being able to get  any golf, he had little appetite these days--was sitting in his  drawing-room, moodily polishing the blade of his jigger. Soon wearying  of this once congenial task, he laid down the club and went to the  front door to see if there was any chance of a thaw. But no. It was  freezing. The snow, as he tested it with his shoe, crackled crisply.  The sky above was black and full of cold stars. It seemed to Mortimer  that the sooner he packed up and went to the South of France, the  better. He was just about to close the door, when suddenly he thought  he heard his own name called.    \"Mortimer!\"    Had he been mistaken? The voice had sounded faint and far away.    \"Mortimer!\"    He thrilled from head to foot. This time there could be no mistake. It  was the voice he knew so well, his wife's voice, and it had come from  somewhere down near the garden-gate. It is difficult to judge distance  where sounds are concerned, but Mortimer estimated that the voice had  spoken about a short mashie-niblick and an easy putt from where he  stood.    The next moment he was racing down the snow-covered path. And then his  heart stood still. What was that dark something on the ground just  inside the gate? He leaped towards it. He passed his hands over it. It  was a human body. Quivering, he struck a match. It went out. He struck  another. That went out, too. He struck a third, and it burnt with a  steady flame; and, stooping, he saw that it was his wife who lay there,  cold and stiff. Her eyes were closed, and on her face still lingered  that faint, sweet smile which he remembered so well.           *       *       *       *       *    The young man rose with a set face. He reached for his golf-bag.    \"I call that a dirty trick,\" he said, \"after you promised--\" The Sage  waved him back to his seat.    \"Have no fear! She had only fainted.\"    \"You said she was cold.\"    \"Wouldn't you be cold if you were lying in the snow?\"    \"And stiff.\"    \"Mrs. Sturgis was stiff because the train-service was bad, it being the  holiday-season, and she had had to walk all the way from the junction,  a distance of eight miles. Sit down and allow me to proceed.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tenderly, reverently Mortimer Sturgis picked her up and began to bear  her into the house. Half-way there, his foot slipped on a piece of ice  and he fell heavily, barking his shin and shooting his lovely burden  out on to the snow.    The fall brought her to. She opened her eyes.    \"Mortimer, darling!\" she said.    Mortimer had just been going to say something else, but he checked  himself.    \"Are you alive?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" she replied.    \"Thank God!\" said Mortimer, scooping some of the snow out of the back  of his collar.    Together they went into the house, and into the drawing-room. Wife  gazed at husband, husband at wife. There was a silence.    \"Rotten weather!\" said Mortimer.    \"Yes, isn't it!\"    The spell was broken. They fell into each other's arms. And presently  they were sitting side by side on the sofa, holding hands, just as if  that awful parting had been but a dream.    It was Mortimer who made the first reference to it.    \"I say, you know,\" he said, \"you oughtn't to have nipped away like  that!\"    \"I thought you hated me!\"    \"Hated _you_! I love you better than life itself! I would sooner  have smashed my pet driver than have had you leave me!\"    She thrilled at the words.    \"Darling!\"    Mortimer fondled her hand.    \"I was just coming back to tell you that I loved you still. I was going  to suggest that you took lessons from some good professional. And I  found you gone!\"    \"I wasn't worthy of you, Mortimer!\"    \"My angel!\" He pressed his lips to her hair, and spoke solemnly. \"All  this has taught me a lesson, dearest. I knew all along, and I know it  more than ever now, that it is you--you that I want. Just you! I don't  care if you don't play golf. I don't care----\" He hesitated, then went on  manfully. \"I don't care even if you play croquet, so long as you are  with me!\"    For a moment her face showed rapture that made it almost angelic. She  uttered a low moan of ecstasy. She kissed him. Then she rose.    \"Mortimer, look!\"    \"What at?\"    \"Me. Just look!\"    The jigger which he had been polishing lay on a chair close by. She  took it up. From the bowl of golf-balls on the mantelpiece she selected  a brand new one. She placed it on the carpet. She addressed it. Then,  with a merry cry of \"Fore!\" she drove it hard and straight through the  glass of the china-cupboard.    \"Good God!\" cried Mortimer, astounded. It had been a bird of a shot.    She turned to him, her whole face alight with that beautiful smile.    \"When I left you, Mortie,\" she said, \"I had but one aim in life,  somehow to make myself worthy of you. I saw your advertisements in the  papers, and I longed to answer them, but I was not ready. All this  long, weary while I have been in the village of Auchtermuchtie, in  Scotland, studying under Tamms McMickle.\"    \"Not the Tamms McMickle who finished fourth in the Open Championship of  1911, and had the best ball in the foursome in 1912 with Jock McHaggis,  Andy McHeather, and Sandy McHoots!\"    \"Yes, Mortimer, the very same. Oh, it was difficult at first. I missed  my mallet, and long to steady the ball with my foot and use the toe of  the club. Wherever there was a direction post "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#14)"],[1," will  summon you.\"    The queen, followed by all the chiefs, retired at once to the  forest, while the Druids proceeded to carry out the sacred mysteries.  Although all knew well what the decision would be, they waited with  suppressed excitement the summons to return and hear the decision  that was to embark them in a desperate struggle with Rome. Some threw  themselves down under the trees, some walked up and down together  discussing in low tones the prospects of a struggle, and the question  what tribes would join it. The queen and her daughters sat apart,  none venturing to approach them. Parta and three other female chiefs  sat a short distance away talking together, while two or three of  the younger chiefs, their attitude towards Beric entirely altered  by the report of the Druids' predictions concerning him, gathered  round him and asked questions concerning the Romans' methods of  fighting, their arms and power. An hour after they had retired a  deep sound of a conch rose in the air. The queen and her daughters  at once moved forward, followed by the four female chiefs, behind  whom came the rest in a body. Issuing from the forest they advanced  to the sacred oak and stood in an attitude of deep respect, while  the chief Druid announced the decision of the gods.    \"The gods have spoken,\" he said. \"Too long have the Iceni stood  aloof from their countrymen, therefore have the gods withdrawn  their faces from them; therefore has punishment and woe fallen upon  them. Prasutagus is dead; his queen and his daughters have suffered  the direst indignities; a Roman has seized the wealth heaped up  by inglorious cowardice. But the moment has come; the gods have  suffered their own altars to be desecrated in order that over the  whole length and breadth of the land the cry for vengeance shall  arise simultaneously. The cup is full; vengeance is at hand upon  the oppressors and tyrants, the land reeks with British blood. Not  content with grasping our possessions, our lives and the honour  of our women are held as nought by them, our altars are cold, our  priests slaughtered. The hour of vengeance is at hand. I see the  smoke of burning cities ascending in the air. I hear the groans of  countless victims to British vengeance. I see broken legions and  flying men.    \"To arms! the gods have spoken. Strike for vengeance. Strike for  the gods. Strike for your country and outraged queen. Chiefs of  the Iceni, to arms! May the curse of the gods fall upon an enemy  who draws back in the day of battle! May the gods give strength to  your arms and render you invincible in battle! The gods have spoken.\"    A mighty shout was raised by his hearers; swords were brandished,  and spears shaken, and the cry \"To arms! the gods have spoken,\"  was repeated unanimously. As the Druids closed round their chief,  who had been seized with strong convulsions as soon as he had uttered  the message of the gods, Boadicea turned to the chiefs and raised  her arm for silence.    \"I am a queen again; I reign once more over a race of men. No  longer do I feel the smart of my stripes, for each shall ere long  be washed out in Roman blood; but before action, counsel, and before  counsel, food, for you have, many of you, come from afar. I have  ordered a feast to be prepared in the forest.\"    She led the way across the opposite side of the glade, where,  a few hundred yards in the forest, a number of the queen's slaves  had prepared a feast of roasted sheep, pig, and ox, with bread and  jars of drink formed of fermented honey, and a sort of beer. As  soon as the meal was concluded the queen called the chiefs round  her, and the assembly was joined by the Druids.    \"War is declared,\" she said; \"the question is shall we commence at  once, or shall we wait?\"    There was a general response \"At once!\" but the chief Druid stepped  forward and said: \"My sons, we must not risk the ruin of all by  undue haste; this must be a national movement if it is to succeed.  For a fortnight we must keep quiet, preparing everything for war,  so that we may take the field with every man capable of bearing  arms in the tribe. In the meantime we, with the aid of the bards,  will spread the news of the outrages that the Romans have committed  upon the queen and her daughters far and wide over the land. Already  the tribes are burning with indignation at the insults to our gods  and the slaughter of our priests at Mona, and this news will arouse  them to madness, for what is done here today may be done elsewhere  tomorrow, and all men will see that only in the total destruction  of the Romans is there a hope of freedom. All will be bidden to  prepare for war, and, when the news comes that the Iceni have taken  up arms, to assemble and march to join us. On this day fortnight,  then, let every chief with his following meet at Cardun, which  is but a short march from Camalodunum. Then we will rush upon the  Roman city, the scene of the outrage to your queen, and its smoke  shall tell Britain that she is avenged, and Rome that her day of  oppression is over.\"    The decision was received with satisfaction. A fortnight was none  too long for making preparations, assembling the tribesmen, and  marching to the appointed spot.    \"One thing I claim,\" Boadicea said, \"and that is the right to fall  upon and destroy instantly the Romans who installed themselves in  my capital, and who are the authors of the outrages upon my daughters.  So long as they live and lord it there I cannot return.\"    \"That is right and just,\" the Druid said. \"Slay all but ten, and  hand them over bound to us to be sacrificed on the altars of the  gods they have insulted.\"    \"I will undertake that task, as my tribe lies nearest the capital,\"  one of the chiefs said. \"I will assemble them tonight and fall upon  the Romans at daybreak.\"    \"See that none escape,\" the Druid said. \"Kill them and all their slaves  and followers. Let not one live to carry the news to Camalodunum.\"    \"I shall be at the meeting place and march at your head,\" the queen  said to the chiefs; \"that victory will be ours I do not doubt;  but if the gods will it otherwise I swear that I shall not survive  defeat. Ye gods, hear my vow.\"    The council was now over, and the queen mingled with the chiefs,  saying a few words to each. Beric was presented to her by his mother,  and Boadicea was particularly gracious to him. \"I have heard great  things predicted of you, Beric. The gods have marked you out for  favour, and their priests tell me that you will be one day a great  champion of the Britons. So may it be. I shall watch you on the  day of battle, and am assured that none among the Iceni will bear  themselves more worthily.\"    An hour later the meeting broke up, and Parta and Beric returned  to Cardun, where they at once began to make preparations for the  approaching conflict. Every man in the tribe was summoned to attend,  and the exercises went on from daybreak till dusk, while the women  cooked and waited upon the men. Councils were held nightly in the  hall, and to each of the chiefs was assigned a special duty, the  whole tribe being treated as a legion, and every chief and fighting  man having his place and duty assigned to him.    In Camalodunum, although nothing was known of the preparations  that were being made, a feeling of great uneasiness prevailed. The  treatment of Boadicea had excited grave disapproval upon the part  of the great majority of the inhabitants, although new arrivals  from Gaul or Rome and the officials in the suite of Decianus lauded  his action as an act of excellent policy.    \"These British slaves must be taught to feel the weight of our arm,\"  they said, \"and a lesson such as this will be most useful. Is it  for dogs like these to complain because they are whipped? They must  be taught to know that they live but at our pleasure; that this  island and all it contains is ours. They have no rights save those  we choose to give them.\"    But the older settlers viewed the matter very differently. They  knew well enough that it was only after hard fighting that Vespasian  had subdued the south, and Ostorius crushed Caractacus. They knew,  too, that the Iceni gave but a nominal submission to Rome, and  that the Trinobantes, crushed as they were, had been driven to the  verge of madness by extortion. Moreover the legions were far away;  Camalodunum was well nigh undefended, and lay almost at the mercy  of the Britons should they attack. They, therefore, denounced the  treatment of Boadicea as not only brutal but as impolitic in the  extreme.    The sudden cessation of news from the officials who had gone to  take possession of the estate of Prasutagus caused considerable  uneasiness among this section of the inhabitants of Camalodunum.  Messengers were sent off every day to inquire as to what had taken  place after the return of Boadicea, but none came back. The feeling  of uneasiness was heightened by the attitude of the natives. Reports  came in from all parts of the district that they had changed their  attitude, that they no longer crouched at the sight of a Roman but  bore themselves defiantly, that there were meetings at night in the  forest, and that the women sang chants and performed dances which  had evidently some hidden meaning.    Decianus, conscious perhaps that his action was strongly disapproved  by all the principal inhabitants of the town, and that, perhaps,  Suetonius would also view it in the same light when it was reported  to him, had left the city a few days after the occurrence and had  gone to Verulamium. His absence permitted the general feeling of  apprehension and discontentment more open expression than it would  otherwise have had. Brave as the Romans were, they were deeply  superstitious, and a thrill of horror and apprehension ran through  the city when it was reported one morning that the statute of Victory  in the temple had fallen to the ground, and had turned"]]]
