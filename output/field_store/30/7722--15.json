The  gasolene feeds by air pressure, and that works standing on its head, as  well as any other way. It's going to be a bit awkward for the men to  operate the controls, but we won't be this way long. Before I start to  right her, though, I want to make sure nothing is broken.\"    Tom signaled to the engine room, and, as the power was off and the  speaking tube could be used, he called through it:    \"How are you down there?\"    \"Right-o!\" came back the answer from a little Englishman Tom had hired  because he knew something about the British tanks. \"'Twas a bit of  nastiness for a while, but it won't take us long to get up ag'in.\"    \"That's good!\" commented Tom. \"I'll come down and have a look at you.\"    It was no easy matter, with the tank capsized, to get to the main  engine room, but Tom Swift managed it. To his delight, aside from a  small break in one of the minor machines, which would not interfere  with the operation or motive force of the monster war engine,  everything was in good shape. There was no leak from the gasolene  tanks, which was one of the contingencies Tom feared, and, as he had  said, the motors would work upside down as well as right side up, a  fact he had proved more than once in his Hawk.    \"Well, we'll make a start,\" he told his chief engineer.  \"Stand by when  I give the signal, and we'll try to crawl out of this right side up.\"    \"How are you going to do it?\" asked Ned, as his chum crawled back into  the observation tower.    \"Well, I'm going to run her part way up the very steepest part of the  ravine I can find--the side of a house would do as well if it could  stand the strain. I'm going to stand the tank right up on her nose, so  to speak, and tip her over so she'll come right again.\"    Slowly the tank started off, while Tom and his friends in the  observation tower anxiously awaited the result of the novel progress.  Ned and Mr. Damon clung to the safety rings.  Tom put his arm through  one and hung on grimly, while he used both hands on the steering  apparatus and the controls.    Of course the trailer wheels were useless in a case of this kind, and  the tank had to be guided by the two belts run at varying speeds.    \"Here we go!\" cried Tom, and the tank started. It was a queer sensation  to be moving upside down, but it did not last very long. Tom steered  the tank straight at the opposite wall of the ravine, where it rose  steeply.  One of the broad belts ran up on that side. The other was  revolved in the opposite direction. Up and up, at a sickening angle,  went Tank A.    Slowly the tank careened, turning completely over on her longer axis,  until, as Tom shut off the power, he and his friends once more found  themselves standing where they belonged--on the floor of the  observation tower.    \"Right side up with care!\" quoted Ned, with a laugh. \"Well, that was  some stunt--believe me!\"    \"Bless my corn plaster, I should say so!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"Well, I'm glad it happened,\" commented Tom. \"It showed what she can do  when she's put to it. Now we'll get out of this ditch.\"    Slowly the tank lumbered along, proper side up now, the men in the  motor room reporting that everything was all right, and that with the  exception of a slight unimportant break, no damage had been done.    Straight for the opposite steep side of the gully Tom directed his  strange craft, and at a point where the wall of the gulch gave a good  footing for the steel belts, Tank A pulled herself out and up to level  ground.    \"Well, I'm glad that's over,\" remarked Ned, with a sigh of relief, as  the tank waddled along a straight stretch. \"And to think of having to  do that same thing under heavy fire!\"    \"That's part of the game,\" remarked Tom. \"And don't forget that we can  fire, too--or we'll be able to when I get the guns in place. They'll  help to balance the machine better, too, and render her less likely to  overturn.\"    Tom considered the test a satisfactory one and, a little later, guided  his tank back to the shop, where men were set to work repairing the  little damage done and making some adjustments.    \"What's next on the program?\" asked Ned of his chum one day about a  week later. \"Any more tests in view?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom. \"I've got the machine guns in place now. We are  going to try them out and also endeavor to demolish a building and some  barbed wire. Like to come along?\"    \"I would!\" cried Ned.    A little later the tank was making her way over a field.  Tom pointed  toward a deserted factory, which had long been partly in ruins, but  some of the walls of which still stood.    \"I'm going to bombard that,\" he announced, and then try to batter it  down and roll over it like a Juggernaut. Are you game?\"    \"Do your worst!\" laughed Ned. \"Let me man one of the machine guns!\"    \"All right,\" agreed Tom. \"Concentrate your fire. Make believe you're  going against the Germans!\"    Slowly, but with resistless energy, the tank approached the ruined  factory.    \"Are you sure there's no one in it, Tom?\"    \"Sure! Blaze away!\"          Chapter XV    Across Country      Ned Newton sighted his machine gun. Tom had showed him how to work it,  and indeed the young bank clerk had had some practice with a weapon  like this, erected on a stationary tripod. But this was the first time  Ned had attempted to fire from the tank while it was moving, and he  found it an altogether different matter.    \"Say, it sure is hard to aim where you want to!\" he shouted across to  Tom, it being necessary, even in the conning tower, where this one gun  was mounted, to speak loudly to make one's self heard above the hum,  the roar and rattle of the machinery in the interior of Tank A, and  below and to the rear of the two young men.    \"Well, that's part of the game,\" Tom answered. \"I'm sending her along  over as smooth ground as I can pick out, but it's rough at best. Still  this is nothing to what you'll get in Flanders.\"    \"If I get there!\" exclaimed Ned grimly. \"Well, here goes!\" and once  more he tried to aim the machine gun at the middle of the brick wall of  the ruined factory.    A moment later there was a rattle and a roar as the quick-firing  mechanism started, and a veritable hail of bullets swept out at the  masonry. Tom and Ned could see where they struck, knocking off bits of  stone, brick and cement.    \"Sweep it, Ned! Sweep it!\" cried Tom. \"Imagine a crowd of Germans are  charging out at you, and sweep 'em out of the way!\"    Obeying this command, the young man moved the barrel of the machine gun  from side to side and slightly up and down.  The effect was at once  apparent. The wall showed spatter-marks of the bullets over a wider  area, and had a body of Teutons been before the factory, or even inside  it, many of them would have been accounted for, since there were  several holes in the wall through which Ned's bullets sped, carrying  potential death with them.    \"That's better!\" shouted Tom. \"That'll do the business!  Now I'm going  to open her up, Ned!\"    \"Open her up?\" cried the young bank clerk, as he ceased firing.    \"Yes; crack the wall of that factory as I would a nut!  Watch me take  it on high--that is, if the old tank doesn't go back on me!\"    \"You mean you're going to ride right over that building, Tom?\"    \"I mean I'm going to try! If Tank A does as I expect her to, she'll  butt into that wall, crush it down by force and weight, and then waddle  over the ruins. Watch!\"    Tom sent some signals to the motor room. At once there was noticed an  increase in the vibrations of the ponderous machine.    \"They're giving her more speed,\" said Tom. \"And I guess we'll need it.\"    Straight for the old factory went Tank A. In spite of its ruined  condition, some of the walls were still firm, and seemed to offer a big  obstacle to even so powerful an engine of war as this monstrous tank.    \"Get ready now, Ned,\" Tom advised. \"And when I crack her open for you  cut loose with the machine gun again. This gun is supposed to fire  straight ahead and a little to either side. There are other guns at  left and right, amidships, as I might say, and there's also one in the  stern, to take care of any attack from that direction.    \"The men in charge of them will fire at the same time you do, and it  will be as near like a real attack as we can make it--with the  exception of not being fired back at. And I wouldn't mind if such were  the case, for I don't believe anything, outside of heavy artillery,  will have any effect on this tank.\"    Tank A was now almost at her maximum speed as she approached closer to  the deserted factory. Ned and Tom, in the conning tower, saw the  largest of the remaining walls looming before them. Straight at it  rushed the ponderous machine, and the next moment there came a shock  which almost threw Ned away from his gun and back against the steel  wall behind him.    \"Hold fast!\" cried Tom. \"Here we go! Fire. Ned! Fire!\"    There was a crash as the blunt nose of the great war tank hit the wall  and crumpled it up.    A great hole was made in the masonry, and what was not crushed under  the caterpillar belts of the tank fell in a shower of bricks, stone and  cement on top of the machine.    Like a great hail storm the broken masonry pelted the steel sides and  top of the tank. But she felt them no more than does an alligator the  attacks of a colony of ants.  Right on through the dust the tank  crushed her way. Added to the noise of the falling walls was that of  the machine guns, which were barking away like a kennel of angry hounds  eager to be unleashed at the quarry.    Ned kept his gun going until the heat of it warned him to stop and let  the barrel cool, or he knew he would jam some of the mechanism. The  other "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#14)"],[1,"is not considered right.        There's Tik-Tok--he's a clockwork man and quite a funny sight--      He talks and walks mechanically, when he's wound up tight;      And we've a Hungry Tiger who would babies love to eat      But never does because we feed him other kinds of meat.        It's hard to name all of the freaks this noble Land's acquired;      'Twould make my song so very long that you would soon be tired;      But give attention while I mention one wise Yellow Hen      And Nine fine Tiny Piglets living in a golden pen.        Just search the whole world over--sail the seas from coast to coast--      No other nation in creation queerer folk can boast;      And now our rare museum will include a Cat of Glass,      A Woozy, and--last but not least--a crazy Patchwork Lass.\"      Ojo was so pleased with this song that he applauded the singer by  clapping his hands, and Scraps followed suit by clapping her padded  fingers together, although they made no noise. The cat pounded on the  floor with her glass paws--gently, so as not to break them--and the  Woozy, which had been asleep, woke up to ask what the row was about.    \"I seldom sing in public, for fear they might want me to start an opera  company,\" remarked the Shaggy Man, who was pleased to know his effort  was appreciated. \"Voice, just now, is a little out of training; rusty,  perhaps.\"    \"Tell me,\" said the Patchwork Girl earnestly, \"do all those queer  people you mention really live in the Land of Oz?\"    \"Every one of 'em. I even forgot one thing: Dorothy's Pink Kitten.\"    \"For goodness sake!\" exclaimed Bungle, sitting up and looking  interested. \"A Pink Kitten? How absurd! Is it glass?\"    \"No; just ordinary kitten.\"    \"Then it can't amount to much. I have pink brains, and you can see 'em  work.\"    \"Dorothy's kitten is all pink--brains and all--except blue eyes. Name's  Eureka. Great favorite at the royal palace,\" said the Shaggy Man,  yawning.    The Glass Cat seemed annoyed.    \"Do you think a pink kitten--common meat--is as pretty as I am?\" she  asked.    \"Can't say. Tastes differ, you know,\" replied the Shaggy Man, yawning  again. \"But here's a pointer that may be of service to you: make  friends with Eureka and you'll be solid at the palace.\"    \"I'm solid now; solid glass.\"    \"You don't understand,\" rejoined the Shaggy Man, sleepily. \"Anyhow,  make friends with the Pink Kitten and you'll be all right. If the Pink  Kitten despises you, look out for breakers.\"    \"Would anyone at the royal palace break a Glass Cat?\"    \"Might. You never can tell. Advise you to purr soft and look humble--if  you can. And now I'm going to bed.\"    Bungle considered the Shaggy Man's advice so carefully that her pink  brains were busy long after the others of the party were fast asleep.          Chapter Twelve    The Giant Porcupine      Next morning they started out bright and early to follow the road of  yellow bricks toward the Emerald City. The little Munchkin boy was  beginning to feel tired from the long walk, and he had a great many  things to think of and consider besides the events of the journey. At  the wonderful Emerald City, which he would presently reach, were so  many strange and curious people that he was half afraid of meeting them  and wondered if they would prove friendly and kind. Above all else, he  could not drive from his mind the important errand on which he had  come, and he was determined to devote every energy to finding the  things that were necessary to prepare the magic recipe. He believed  that until dear Unc Nunkie was restored to life he could feel no joy in  anything, and often he wished that Unc could be with him, to see all  the astonishing things Ojo was seeing. But alas Unc Nunkie was now a  marble statue in the house of the Crooked Magician and Ojo must not  falter in his efforts to save him.    The country through which they were passing was still rocky and  deserted, with here and there a bush or a tree to break the dreary  landscape. Ojo noticed one tree, especially, because it had such long,  silky leaves and was so beautiful in shape. As he approached it he  studied the tree earnestly, wondering if any fruit grew on it or if it  bore pretty flowers.    Suddenly he became aware that he had been looking at that tree a long  time--at least for five minutes--and it had remained in the same  position, although the boy had continued to walk steadily on. So he  stopped short, and when he stopped, the tree and all the landscape, as  well as his companions, moved on before him and left him far behind.    Ojo uttered such a cry of astonishment that it aroused the Shaggy Man,  who also halted. The others then stopped, too, and walked back to the  boy.    \"What's wrong?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"Why, we're not moving forward a bit, no matter how fast we walk,\"  declared Ojo. \"Now that we have stopped, we are moving backward! Can't  you see? Just notice that rock.\"    Scraps looked down at her feet and said: \"The yellow bricks are not  moving.\"    \"But the whole road is,\" answered Ojo.    \"True; quite true,\" agreed the Shaggy Man. \"I know all about the tricks  of this road, but I have been thinking of something else and didn't  realize where we were.\"    \"It will carry us back to where we started from,\" predicted Ojo,  beginning to be nervous.    \"No,\" replied the Shaggy Man; \"it won't do that, for I know a trick to  beat this tricky road. I've traveled this way before, you know. Turn  around, all of you, and walk backward.\"    \"What good will that do?\" asked the cat.    \"You'll find out, if you obey me,\" said the Shaggy Man.    So they all turned their backs to the direction in which they wished to  go and began walking backward. In an instant Ojo noticed they were  gaining ground and as they proceeded in this curious way they soon  passed the tree which had first attracted his attention to their  difficulty.    \"How long must we keep this up, Shags?\" asked Scraps, who was  constantly tripping and tumbling down, only to get up again with a  laugh at her mishap.    \"Just a little way farther,\" replied the Shaggy Man.    A few minutes later he called to them to turn about quickly and step  forward, and as they obeyed the order they found themselves treading  solid ground.    \"That task is well over,\" observed the Shaggy Man. \"It's a little  tiresome to walk backward, but that is the only way to pass this part  of the road, which has a trick of sliding back and carrying with it  anyone who is walking upon it.\"    With new courage and energy they now trudged forward and after a time  came to a place where the road cut through a low hill, leaving high  banks on either side of it. They were traveling along this cut, talking  together, when the Shaggy Man seized Scraps with one arm and Ojo with  another and shouted: \"Stop!\"    \"What's wrong now?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    \"See there!\" answered the Shaggy Man, pointing with his finger.    Directly in the center of the road lay a motionless object that  bristled all over with sharp quills, which resembled arrows. The body  was as big as a ten-bushel-basket, but the projecting quills made it  appear to be four times bigger.    \"Well, what of it?\" asked Scraps.    \"That is Chiss, who causes a lot of trouble along this road,\" was the  reply.    \"Chiss! What is Chiss?    \"I think it is merely an overgrown porcupine, but here in Oz they  consider Chiss an evil spirit. He's different from a reg'lar porcupine,  because he can throw his quills in any direction, which an American  porcupine cannot do. That's what makes old Chiss so dangerous. If we  get too near, he'll fire those quills at us and hurt us badly.\"    \"Then we will be foolish to get too near,\" said Scraps.    \"I'm not afraid,\" declared the Woozy. \"The Chiss is cowardly, I'm sure,  and if it ever heard my awful, terrible, frightful growl, it would be  scared stiff.\"    \"Oh; can you growl?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"That is the only ferocious thing about me,\" asserted the Woozy with  evident pride. \"My growl makes an earthquake blush and the thunder  ashamed of itself. If I growled at that creature you call Chiss, it  would immediately think the world had cracked in two and bumped against  the sun and moon, and that would cause the monster to run as far and as  fast as its legs could carry it.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"you are now able to do us all a  great favor. Please growl.\"    \"But you forget,\" returned the Woozy; \"my tremendous growl would also  frighten you, and if you happen to have heart disease you might expire.\"    \"True; but we must take that risk,\" decided the Shaggy Man, bravely.  \"Being warned of what is to occur we must try to bear the terrific  noise of your growl; but Chiss won't expect it, and it will scare him  away.\"    The Woozy hesitated.    \"I'm fond of you all, and I hate to shock you,\" it said.    \"Never mind,\" said Ojo.    \"You may be made deaf.\"    \"If so, we will forgive you.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the Woozy in a determined voice, and advanced a  few steps toward the giant porcupine. Pausing to look back, it asked:  \"All ready?\"    \"All ready!\" they answered.    \"Then cover up your ears and brace yourselves firmly. Now, then--look  out!\"    The Woozy turned toward Chiss, opened wide its mouth and said:    \"Quee-ee-ee-eek.\"    \"Go ahead and growl,\" said Scraps.    \"Why, I--I did growl!\" retorted the Woozy, who seemed much astonished.    \"What, that little squeak?\" she cried.    \"It is the most awful growl that ever was heard, on land or sea, in  caverns or in the sky,\" protested the Woozy. \"I wonder you stood the  shock so well. Didn't you feel the ground tremble? I suppose Chiss is  now quite dead with fright.\"    The Shaggy Man laughed merrily.    \"Poor Wooz!\" said he; \"your growl wouldn't scare a fly.\"    The Woozy seemed to be humiliated and surprised. It hung its head a  moment, as if in shame or sorrow, but then it said with renewed  confidence: \"Anyhow, my eyes"]]]
