Wood, stones, fire, water, flesh, iron, and the like things, which I name  and discourse of, are things that I know. And I should not have known  them but that I perceived them by my senses; and things perceived by the  senses are immediately perceived; and things immediately perceived are  ideas; and ideas cannot exist without the mind; their existence therefore  consists in being perceived; when, therefore, they are actually perceived  there can be no doubt of their existence. Away then with all that  scepticism, all those ridiculous philosophical doubts. What a jest is it  for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things, till he  hath it proved to him from the veracity of God; or to pretend our  knowledge in this point falls short of intuition or demonstration! I  might as well doubt of my own being, as of the being of those things I  actually see and feel.    HYL.  Not so fast, Philonous: you say you cannot conceive how sensible  things should exist without the mind. Do you not?    PHIL.  I do.    HYL.  Supposing you were annihilated, cannot you conceive it possible  that things perceivable by sense may still exist?    PHIL.  _I_ can; but then it must be in another mind. When I deny  sensible things an existence out of the mind, I do not mean my mind in  particular, but all minds. Now, it is plain they have an existence  exterior to my mind; since I find them by experience to be independent of  it. There is therefore some other Mind wherein they exist, during the  intervals between the times of my perceiving them: as likewise they  did before my birth, and would do after my supposed annihilation. And, as  the same is true with regard to all other finite created spirits, it  necessarily follows there is an OMNIPRESENT ETERNAL MIND, which knows  and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our view in such a  manner, and according to such rules, as He Himself hath ordained, and are  by us termed the LAWS OF NATURE.    HYL.  Answer me, Philonous. Are all our ideas perfectly inert beings? Or  have they any agency included in them?    PHIL.  They are altogether passive and inert.    HYL.  And is not God an agent, a being purely active?    PHIL.  I acknowledge it.    HYL.  No idea therefore can be like unto, or represent the nature of  God?    PHIL.  It cannot.    HYL.  Since therefore you have no IDEA of the mind of God, how can you  conceive it possible that things should exist in His mind? Or, if you can  conceive the mind of God, without having an idea of it, why may not I be  allowed to conceive the existence of Matter, notwithstanding I have no  idea of it?    PHIL.  As to your first question: I own I have properly no IDEA,  either of God or any other spirit; for these being active, cannot be  represented by things perfectly inert, as our ideas are. I do  nevertheless know that I, who am a spirit or thinking substance, exist as  certainly as I know my ideas exist. Farther, I know what I mean by the  terms I AND MYSELF; and I know this immediately or intuitively, though  I do not perceive it as I perceive a triangle, a colour, or a sound. The  Mind, Spirit, or Soul is that indivisible unextended thing which thinks,  acts, and perceives. I say INDIVISIBLE, because unextended; and  UNEXTENDED, because extended, figured, moveable things are ideas; and  that which perceives ideas, which thinks and wills, is plainly itself no  idea, nor like an idea. Ideas are things inactive, and perceived. And  Spirits a sort of beings altogether different from them. I do not  therefore say my soul is an idea, or like an idea. However, taking the  word IDEA in a large sense, my soul may be said to furnish me with an  idea, that is, an image or likeness of God--though indeed extremely  inadequate. For, all the notion I have of God is obtained by reflecting  on my own soul, heightening its powers, and removing its  imperfections. I have, therefore, though not an inactive idea, yet in  MYSELF some sort of an active thinking image of the Deity. And, though  I perceive Him not by sense, yet I have a notion of Him, or know Him by  reflexion and reasoning. My own mind and my own ideas I have an immediate  knowledge of; and, by the help of these, do mediately apprehend the  possibility of the existence of other spirits and ideas. Farther, from my  own being, and from the dependency I find in myself and my ideas, I do,  by an act of reason, necessarily infer the existence of a God, and of all  created things in the mind of God. So much for your first question. For  the second: I suppose by this time you can answer it yourself. For you  neither perceive Matter objectively, as you do an inactive being or idea;  nor know it, as you do yourself, by a reflex act, neither do you  mediately apprehend it by similitude of the one or the other; nor yet  collect it by reasoning from that which you know immediately. All which  makes the case of MATTER widely different from that of the DEITY.    HYL.  You say your own soul supplies you with some sort of an idea or  image of God. But, at the same time, you acknowledge you have, properly  speaking, no IDEA of your own soul. You even affirm that spirits are a  sort of beings altogether different from ideas. Consequently that no idea  can be like a spirit. We have therefore no idea of any spirit. You admit  nevertheless that there is spiritual Substance, although you have no idea  of it; while you deny there can be such a thing as material Substance,  because you have no notion or idea of it. Is this fair dealing? To act  consistently, you must either admit Matter or reject Spirit. What say you  to this?    PHIL.  _I_ say, in the first place, that I do not deny the existence of  material substance, merely because I have no notion of it' but because  the notion of it is inconsistent; or, in other words, because it is  repugnant that there should be a notion of it. Many things, for aught I  know, may exist, whereof neither I nor any other man hath or can have any  idea or notion whatsoever. But then those things must be possible, that  is, nothing inconsistent must be included in their definition. I  say, secondly, that, although we believe things to exist which we do not  perceive, yet we may not believe that any particular thing exists,  without some reason for such belief: but I have no reason for believing  the existence of Matter. I have no immediate intuition thereof: neither  can I immediately from my sensations, ideas, notions, actions, or  passions, infer an unthinking, unperceiving, inactive Substance--either  by probable deduction, or necessary consequence. Whereas the being of my  Self, that is, my own soul, mind, or thinking principle, I evidently know  by reflexion. You will forgive me if I repeat the same things in answer  to the same objections. In the very notion or definition of MATERIAL  SUBSTANCE, there is included a manifest repugnance and inconsistency.  But this cannot be said of the notion of Spirit. That ideas should exist  in what doth not perceive, or be produced by what doth not act, is  repugnant. But, it is no repugnancy to say that a perceiving thing should  be the subject of ideas, or an active thing the cause of them. It is  granted we have neither an immediate evidence nor a demonstrative  knowledge of the existence of other finite spirits; but it will not  thence follow that such spirits are on a foot with material substances:  if to suppose the one be inconsistent, and it be not inconsistent to  suppose the other; if the one can be inferred by no argument, and there  is a probability for the other; if we see signs and effects indicating  distinct finite agents like ourselves, and see no sign or symptom  whatever that leads to a rational belief of Matter. I say, lastly, that I  have a notion of Spirit, though I have not, strictly speaking, an idea of  it. I do not perceive it as an idea, or by means of an idea, but know it  by reflexion.    HYL.  Notwithstanding all you have said, to me it seems that, according  to your own way of thinking, and in consequence of your own principles,  it should follow that YOU are only a system of floating ideas, without  any substance to support them. Words are not to be used without a  meaning. And, as there is no more meaning in SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE than  in MATERIAL SUBSTANCE, the one is to be exploded as well as the other.    PHIL.  How often must I repeat, that I know or am conscious of my own  being; and that _I_ MYSELF am not my ideas, but somewhat else, a  thinking, active principle that perceives, knows, wills, and operates  about ideas. I know that I, one and the same self, perceive both  colours and sounds: that a colour cannot perceive a sound, nor a sound a  colour: that I am therefore one individual principle, distinct from  colour and sound; and, for the same reason, from aft other sensible  things and inert ideas. But, I am not in like manner conscious either of  the existence or essence of Matter. On the contrary, I know that nothing  inconsistent can exist, and that the existence of Matter implies an  inconsistency. Farther, I know what I mean when I affirm that there is a  spiritual substance or support of ideas, that is, that a spirit knows and  perceives ideas. But, I do not know what is meant when it is said that an  unperceiving substance hath inherent in it and supports either ideas or  the archetypes of ideas. There is therefore upon the whole no parity of  case between Spirit and Matter.    HYL.  I own myself satisfied in this point. But, do you in earnest think  the real existence of sensible things consists in their being actually  perceived? If so; how comes it that all mankind distinguish between them?

Which toppled over,  and coolly pushed the great basin of milk off the shelf on to the floor.  I don't know if ever you have tried to clean a board floor after milk,  but I am sure you can imagine it would be a disagreeable task,  especially if you had scrubbed it well only that morning.  It was hardly  to be wondered at, therefore, that Martha, in her profound irritation  at the disaster, turned angrily round, and, pointing to the figure  now stuck in the window, demanded in an exasperated tone whether  the blessed saints could stand that dratted boy any longer, for she  couldn't, so there.    The Captain took an angry step into the pantry and gave a roar of  command for Bunty to come down.    The boy dropped in an agony of dread and shrinking.    \"Always his hands a-pickin' and stealin' and his tongue a-lyin',\"  said Martha Tomlinson, gazing unkindly at the unhappy child.    Two, three, four, five angry cuts from the riding-whip in the  Captain's hands, and Bunty had ducked under his arm and fled howling  down the passage and out of the back door.    Away across the paddocks he went, sobbing at every step, but hugely  commending himself for bearing all this for someone else's sake.    He could hardly have believed, had anyone told him previously, that  he could have done anything so absolutely noble, and the thought  comforted him even while the cuts and scratches smarted.  He tried to  stifle his sobs as he reached the shed, and even stuffed half a  handful of currants into his mouth towards that end.    But it was a very tearful, scratched, miserable face that bobbed up  the opening near Judy again.    She did not move, though her eyes were half open, and he knelt down  and shook her shoulder gently.    \"Here's some things, Judy--ain't you goin' to eat them?\"    She shook her head very slightly.    \"Have some corned beef, or some currants; there's some peel, too, if  you'd rather.\"    She shook her head again.  \"Do take them away,\" she said, with a  little moan.    A look of blank disappointment stole over his small, heated face.    \"An' I've half killed myself to get them!  Well, you ARE a mean girl!\"  he said.    \"Oh, DO go away,\":  Judy moaned, moving her head restlessly from  side to side.  \"Oh, how my feet ache! no--my head, and my side--oh!  I don't know what it is!\"    \"I got hit here and here,\" Bunty said, indicating the places, and  wiping away tears of keen self-pity with his coat sleeve.  \"I'm scratched  all over with that beastly old cactus.\"    \"Do you suppose there are many miles more?\" Judy said, in such a  quick way that all the words seemed to run into each other. \"I've  walked hundreds and hundreds, and haven't got home yet.  I suppose  it's because the world's round, and I'll be walling in at the school  gate again presently.\"    \"Don't be an idjut!\" Bunty said gruffly.    \"You'll be sure and certain, Marian, never to breathe a word of it;  I've trusted you, and if you keep faith I can go home and come back  and no one will know.  And lend me two shillings, can you?  I've not  got much left.  Bunty, you selfish little pig, you might get me some  milk!  I've been begging and begging of you for hours, and my head is  going to Catherine wheels for want of it.\"    \"Have some corned beef, Judy, dear--oh, Judy, don't be so silly and  horrid after I nearly got killed for you,\" Bunty said, trying with  trembling fingers to stuff a piece into her mouth.    The little girl rolled over and began muttering again.    \"Seventy-seven miles,\" she said, \"and I walked eleven yesterday,  that makes eleven hundred and seventy-seven--and six the day before  because my foot had a blister--that's eleven hundred and eighty-three.  And if I walk ten miles a day I shall get home in eleven hundred and  eighty-three times ten, that's a thousand and--and--oh! what is it?  whatever is it?  Bunty, you horrid little pig, can't you, tell me what  it is?  My head aches too much to work, and a thousand and something  days--that's a year--two years--two years--three years before I get there.  Oh, Pip, Meg, three years! oh, Esther! ask him, ask him to let me come  home!  Three years--years--years!\"    The last word was almost shrieked and the child struggled to her feet  and tried to walk.    Bunty caught her arms and held her.  \"Let me go, can't you?\" she said  hoarsely.  \"I shall never get there at this rate.  Three years, and all  those miles!\"    She pushed him aside and tried to walk across the loft, but her legs  tottered under her and she fell down in a little senseless heap.  \"Meg--I'll fetch Meg,\" said the little boy in a trembling, alarmed  voice, and he slipped down the opening and hastened up to the house.          CHAPTER XI    The Truant      He burst into Meg's bedroom like a whirlwind.  \"She's in the old shed,  Meg, and I'm not sure, but I think she's gone mad;  and I've had the  awfullest beating, and got nearly killed with the cactus for her, and  never told anything.  She can't eat the corned beef, either, after all.  She's run away--and oh, I'm sure she's mad!\"    Meg lifted a pale, startled face from the pillows.  \"Who on earth--what--\"    \"Judy,\" he said, and burst into excited sobs.  \"She's in the shed,  and I think she's mad!\"    Meg got slowly out of bed, huddled on some clothes, and even then  utterly disbelieving the wild story, went downstairs with him.    In the hall they met their father, who was just going out.    \"Are you better?\" he said to Meg.  \"You should have stayed in bed  all day; however, perhaps the air will do you more good.\"    \"Yes,\" she said mechanically.    \"I'm going out for the rest of the day; indeed, I don't expect  either Esther or myself will be back till to-morrow morning.\"    \"Yes,\" repeated Meg.    \"Don't let the children blow the house up, and take care of  yourself--oh! and send Bunty to bed without any tea--he's had  enough for one day, I'm sure.\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl again, only taking in the import of what the  last pledged her to when Bunty whispered a fierce \"Sneak!\" at her  elbow.    Then the dogcart rattled up; and the Captain went away, to their  unspeakable relief.    \"Now what is this mad story?\" Meg said, turning to her small  brother.  \"I suppose it's one of your untruths, you bad little boy.\"    \"Come and see,\"'  Bunty returned, and he led the way through the  paddocks.  Half-way down they met Pip and Nell, returning earlier  than expected from the fishing expedition.  Nellie looked sad, and  was walking at a respectful distance behind her brother.    \"You might as well take a phonograph with you as Nellie,\" he said,  casting a look of withering scorn on that delinquent.  \"She talked the  whole time, and didn't give me a chance of a bite.\"    \"Judy's home,\" said Bunty, almost bursting with the importance of his  knowledge.  \"No one's seen her but me; I've nearly got killed  with climbing up cactuses and into windows and things, and I've had  thrashings from Father and everything, but I never told a word, did  I, Meg?  I've got her up in the shed here, and I went and got corned  beef and everything just you look at my legs:\"    He displayed his scars proudly, but Meg hurried on, and Pip and Nell  followed in blank amazement.  At the shed they stopped.    \"It's a yarn of Bunty's,\" Pip said contemptuously. \"'Tisn't April  the first yet, my son.\"    \"Come and see,\" Bunty returned, swarming up.  Pip followed, and gave  a low cry; then Meg and Nell, with rather more difficulty, scrambled  up, and the scene was complete.    The delirium had passed, and Judy was lying with wide-open eyes  gazing in a tired way at the rafters.    She smiled up at them as they gathered round her.  \"If Mahomet won't  come to the mountain,\" she said, and then coughed for two or three  minutes.    \"What have you been doing, Ju, old girl?\" Pip said, with an odd  tremble in his voice.  The sight of his favourite sister, thin,  hollow-checked, exhausted, was too much for his boyish manliness.  A moisture came to his eyes.    \"How d'you come, Ju?\" he said, blinking it away.    And the girl gave her old bright look up at him.  \"Sure and they  keep no pony but shank's at school,\" she said; \"were you afther  thinkin' I should charter a balloon?\"    She coughed again.    Meg dropped down on her knees and put her arms round her little thin  sister.    \"Judy,\" she cried, \"oh, Judy, Judy! my dear, my dear!\"    Judy laughed for a little time, and called her an old silly, but she  soon broke down and sobbed convulsively.  \"I'm so hungry,\" she said,  at last pitifully.    They all four, started up as though they would fetch the stores of  Sydney to satisfy her.  Then Meg sat down again and lifted the  rough, curly head on her lap.    \"You go, Pip,\" she said, \"and bring wine and a glass, and in the  meat-safe there's some roast chicken; I had it for my lunch, and  Martha said she would put the rest there till tea; and be quick, Pip.\"    \"My word!\" said Pip to himself, and he slipped down and flew across  to the house.    \"Up_on_ my word!\" said Martha, meeting him in the hall five minutes  later, a cut-glass decanter under his arm, a wineglass held in his  teeth by the stem, a dish of cold chicken in his hand, and bread  and butter in a little stack beside the chicken.  \"Upon my word!  And what next, might I ask?\"    \"Oh, shut up, and hang your grandmother!\" said Pip, brushing past  her, and going a circuitous voyage to the shed lest she should be  watching.    He knelt down beside his little sister and fed her with morsels of  chicken and sips of wine, and stroked her wild hair, and called  her old girl fifty times, and besought her to eat just a little more  and a little more.    And Judy, catching the look in the brown, wet eyes above her, ate all  he offered, though the first mouthful nearly choked her; she would  have eaten it had it been elephant's hide, seeing she loved this boy  better than anything else in the world, and he was in such distress.  She was the better for it, too,"]]]
