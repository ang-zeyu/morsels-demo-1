But whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not--we may be  allowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \"a  Six-preacher\"--there is no doubt as to its geographical position;  there is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from  Velletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of AEquian  encampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the  Volscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between  them and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark  more than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by  us, in the low ground--reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale--the  walls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful  height and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves  hidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,  as we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its  mountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller  detached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.    Segni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the  same class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but  a table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on  the mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it  with Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the  immediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the  same as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano  has more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of  being an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long  and narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the  space within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The  space within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded  with dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one  quarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other  cases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the _arx_ of  Signia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,  but placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between  the two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of  the modern Signians; but under the name of _Passegiata_ it does form  part of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the  other loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the  traveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of  the road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway  of Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the  great number of graceful fragments of mediaeval work to be found within  the narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages  too poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing  beauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from  entering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit  of the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the  right hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case  overwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen  far away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the  gateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as  it were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing  which the primaeval city has to show him.    But before he can reach either the Roman or the primaeval gate he will  have begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is  hardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great  deal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.  The huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note  perhaps two stages, yet often intermingled--one, where the sides _only_  of the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where  the outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \"rustication\" in  late _Renaissance_ work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a  state of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the  shape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In  a later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand  free from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy  to say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how  much to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it  somewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,  and a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.  But it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of  the hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the  whole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required  it, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some  distance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally  known as _Porta Saracenesca_, leads from the outside world into the  outer enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close  to the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most  likely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds  no small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of  those instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of  the principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search  of it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out  of stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they  were striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting  on two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as  those of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle  of the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was  to place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately  under the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of  the lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain  vain striving after something different. As such, it is no small  lesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled  together to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us  back from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when  the arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days  when men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of  constructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are  mere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look  than those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the  lintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever  their relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to  innovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last  crowned with success.    It is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can  understand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,  which has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called  _arco Gotico_; it is harder to guess why the great primaeval gate of  Segni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only  primaeval gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been  counted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of  the enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall  coincide. Hard by _Porta Saracenesca_ itself is a small sally-port;  of the others, the larger ones, like _Porta Saracenesca_ itself,  stand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same  strivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the  ground forbids the _arx_ from reaching any great height above the rest  of the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular  large cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions  of different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.  Here is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive  construction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the _cella_ in  Roman masonry, and the Roman wall of the _cella_ is now carried up to  form a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,  but it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes  which the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.    Landed, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of  the greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its  satellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide  available at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case  we see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third  and greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of  Segni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the  Catholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.  Peter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.    We are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over  the valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with  double force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,  but still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and  his lion-like reign.          Iter ad Brundisium.    I. Anagni.

Here is what  he says in his introduction (p. 3):       \"Je sais  que l'on nous conteste le droit de qualifier ainsi     [that is, to call heresies] les tendances qui furent si     vivement combattues par les premiers Peres.  La designation     meme d'heresie semble une atteinte portee a la liberte de     conscience et de pensee.  Nous ne pouvons partager ce scrupule,     car il n'irait a rien moins qu'a enlever au Christianisme tout     caractere distinctif.\" [see Footnote]        [Footnote: \"I know that our right to qualify thus the      tendencies which were so actively opposed by the early      Fathers is contested.  The very use of the word heresy      seems an attack upon liberty of conscience and thought.      We cannot share this scruple; for it would amount to      nothing less than depriving Christianity of all      distinctive character.\"]    And though he tells us that after Constantine's time the Church  did actually abuse its power by designating those who dissented  from it as heretics and persecuting them, yet he says, when  speaking of early times:       \"L'eglise est une libre association; il y a tout profit a se     separer d'elle.  La polemique contre l'erreur n'a d'autres     ressources que la pensee et le sentiment. Un type doctrinal     uniforme n'a pas encore ete elabore; les divergences     secondaires se produisent en Orient et en Occident avec une     entiere liberte; la theologie n'est point liee a d'invariables     formules.  Si au sein de cette diversite apparait un fonds     commun de croyances, n'est-on pas en droit d'y voir non pas un     systeme formule et compose par les representants d'une     autorite d'ecole, mais la foi elle-meme dons son instinct le     plus sur et sa manifestation la plus spontanee?  Si cette meme     unanimite qui se revele dans les croyances essentielles, se     retrouve pour repousser telles ou telles tendances ne serons     nous pas en droit de conclure que ces tendances etaient en     desacord flagrant avec les principes fondamentaux du     christianisme?  Cette presomption ne se transformerait-elle     pas en certitude si nous reconnaissons dans la doctrine     universellement repoussee par l'Eglise les traits     caracteristiques de l'une des religions du passe?  Pour dire     que le gnosticisme ou l'ebionitisme sont les formes legitimes     de la pensee chretienne il faut dire hardiment qu'il n'y a pas     de pensee chretienne, ni de caractere specifique qui la fasse     reconnaitre.  Sous pretexte de l'elargir, on la dissout.     Personne au temps de Platon n'eut ose couvrir de son nom une     doctrine qui n'eut pas fait place a la theorie des idees; et     l'on eut excite les justes moqueries de la Grece, en voulant     faire d'Epicure ou de Zenon un disciple de l'Academie.     Reconnaissons donc que s'il existe une religion ou une     doctrine qui s'appelle christianisme, elle peut avoir ses     heresies.\" [see Footnote]        [Footnote: \"The Church is a free association; there is much to      be gained by separation from it.  Conflict with error has no      weapons other than thought and feeling.  One uniform type of      doctrine has not yet been elaborated; divergencies in      secondary matters arise freely in East and West; theology is      not wedded to invariable formulas.  If in the midst of this      diversity a mass of beliefs common to all is apparent, is one      not justified in seeing in it, not a formulated system, framed      by the representatives of pedantic authority, but faith itself      in its surest instinct and its most spontaneous manifestation?      If the same unanimity which is revealed in essential points of      belief is found also in rejecting certain tendencies, are we      not justified in concluding that these tendencies were in      flagrant opposition to the fundamental principles of      Christianity?  And will not this presumption be transformed      into certainty if we recognize in the doctrine universally      rejected by the Church the characteristic features of one of      the religions of the past?  To say that gnosticism or      ebionitism are legitimate forms of Christian thought, one must      boldly deny the existence of Christian thought at all, or any      specific character by which it could be recognized.  While      ostensibly widening its realm, one undermines it.  No one in      the time of Plato would have ventured to give his name to a      doctrine in which the theory of ideas had no place, and one      would deservedly have excited the ridicule of Greece by trying      to pass off Epicurus or Zeno as a disciple of the Academy.      Let us recognize, then, that if a religion or a doctrine      exists which is called Christianity, it may have its      heresies.\"]    The author's whole argument amounts to this: that every opinion  which differs from the code of dogmas we believe in at a given  time, is heresy.  But of course at any given time and place men  always believe in something or other; and this belief in  something, indefinite at any place, at some time, cannot be a  criterion of truth.    It all amounts to this: since ubi Christus ibi Ecclesia, then  Christus is where we are.    Every so-called heresy, regarding, as it does, its own creed as  the truth, can just as easily find in Church history a series of  illustrations of its own creed, can use all Pressense's arguments  on its own behalf, and can call its own creed the one truly  Christian creed.  And that is just what all heresies do and have  always done.    The only definition of heresy (the word [GREEK WORD], means a  part) is this: the name given by a body of men to any opinion  which rejects a part of the Creed professed by that body.  The  more frequent meaning, more often ascribed to the word heresy, is  --that of an opinion which rejects the Church doctrine founded and  supported by the temporal authorities.        [TRANSCRIBIST'S NOTE: The GREEK WORD above used Greek letters,      spelled: alpha(followed by an apostrophe)-iota(with accent)-      rho-epsilon-sigma-iota-zeta]    There is a remarkable and voluminous work, very little known,  \"Unpartheyische Kirchen- und Ketzer-Historie,\" 1729, by Gottfried  Arnold, which deals with precisely this subject, and points out  all the unlawfulness, the arbitrariness, the senselessness, and  the cruelty of using the word heretic in the sense of reprobate.  This book is an attempt to write the history of Christianity in  the form of a history of heresy.    In the introduction the author propounds a series of questions:  (1) Of those who make heretics; (2) Of those whom they made  heretics; (3) Of heretical subjects themselves; (4) Of the method  of making heretics; and (5) Of the object and result of making  heretics.    On each of these points he propounds ten more questions, the  answers to which he gives later on from the works of well-known  theologians.  But he leaves the reader to draw for himself the  principal conclusion from the expositions in the whole book.  As  examples of these questions, in which the answers are to some  extent included also, I will quote the following. Under the 4th  head, of the manner in which heretics are made, he says, in one of  the questions (in the 7th):       \"Does not all history show that the greatest makers of     heretics and masters of that craft were just these wise men,     from whom the Father hid his secrets, that is, the hypocrites,     the Pharisees, and lawyers, men utterly godless and perverted     (Question 20-21)?  And in the corrupt times of Christianity     were not these very men cast out, denounced by the hypocrites     and envious, who were endowed by God with great gifts and who     would in the days of pure Christianity have been held in high     honor?  And, on the other hand, would not the men who, in the     decline of Christianity raised themselves above all, and     regarded themselves as the teachers of the purest Christianity,     would not these very men, in the times of the apostles and     disciples of Christ, have been regarded as the most shameless     heretics and anti-Christians?\"    He expounds, among other things in these questions, the theory  that any verbal expression of faith, such as was demanded by the  Church, and the departure from which was reckoned as heresy, could  never fully cover the exact religious ideas of a believer, and  that therefore the demand for an expression of faith in certain  words was ever productive of heresy, and he says, in Question 21:       \"And if heavenly things and thoughts present themselves to a     man's mind as so great and so profound that he does not find     corresponding words to express them, ought one to call him a     heretic, because he cannot express his idea with perfect     exactness?\"    And in Question 33:       \"And is not the fact that there was no heresy in the earliest     days due to the fact that the Christians did not judge one     another by verbal expressions, but by deed and by heart, since     they had perfect liberty to express their ideas without the     dread of being called heretics; was it not the easiest and most     ordinary ecclesiastical proceeding, if the clergy wanted to get     rid of or to ruin anyone, for them to cast suspicion on the     person's belief, and to throw a cloak of heresy upon him, and     by this means to procure his condemnation and removal?       \"True though it may be that there were sins and errors among     the so-called heretics, it is no less true and evident,\" he     says farther on, \"from the innumerable examples quoted here     (i. e., in the history of the Church and of heresy), that there     was not a single sincere and conscientious man of any     importance whom the Churchmen would not from envy or other     causes have ruined.\"    Thus, almost two hundred years ago, the real meaning of heresy was  understood.  And notwithstanding that, the same conception of it "]]]
