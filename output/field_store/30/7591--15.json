[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#14)"],[1,"how he drifted out here?\"    While Sam was speaking Dan Baxter raised his eyes from the  newspaper and glanced around.  As his gaze fell upon the three  Rover boys he started and the paper fell to the floor, then he got  up and strode toward them.    \"Dick Rover!\" he cried.  \"Where did you fellows come from?\"    \"From Putnam Hall, Baxter,\" answered Dick quietly.  \"And what  brought you here?\"    Ordinarily Dan Baxter would have retorted that that was none of  Dick's business, but now he was in thoroughly low spirits, and he  answered meekly:    \"I've been playing in hard luck.  I went down to New York and one  night when I was in a sailors' boarding house I drank more than  was good for me, and when I woke up in the morning I found myself  on a vessel bound for Africa.\"    \"You were shanghaied as a sailor?\" asked Tom.    \"That's it, and while I was on board the Costelk the captain and  mate treated me worse than a dog.  See that eye?  The captain did  that, and when I struck back he put me in irons and fed me nothing  but stale biscuits and water.\"    \"And the ship left you here?\"    \"No; she was bound for Cape Town, but stopped here for supplies,  and I jumped overboard at night and swam ashore, and here I am,  and sorry for it,\" and Dan Baxter drew a long breath.    The Rovers were astonished at his meek manner.  Was this really  the domineering Baxter, who had always insisted on having his own  way, and who had done so many wrong deeds in the past?    \"You've had a hard time of it, I suppose? said Dick, hardly  knowing how to go on.    \"Hard, Dick, aint no word,\" came from the former bully of Putnam  Hall.  \"I've run up against the worst luck that anybody could ever  imagine.  But I reckon you don't care about that?\"    \"Do you think we ought to care, Baxter?\"    \"Well, it aint fair to take advantage of a chap when he's down on  his luck,\" grumbled the former bully.  \"I guess I've learnt my  lesson all right enough.\"    \"Do you mean to say you are going to turn over a new leaf?\"  queried Sam with interest.    \"Yes, if I ever get the chance.\"    Randolph Rover now joined the group, and Dick explained the  situation.  Mr. Rover questioned Baxter closely and found that he  was without a cent in his pocket and that the hotel keeper had  threatened to put him out if he was not able to pay up inside of  the next twenty-four hours.    \"See here, Baxter, you never were my friend, and you never  deserved any good from me, but I don't like to see a dog suffer,\"  said Dick.  \"I'll give you thirty shillings, and that will help  you along a little,\" and he drew out his purse.    \"And I'll give you the same,\" came from Tom.    \"Ditto from me,\" said Sam.  \"But don't forget that what Dick says  is true, nevertheless.\"    Ninety English shillings--about twenty-two dollars of our money--was  more cash than Dan Baxter had seen in some time, his other  money having been spent before he had taken his unexpected ocean  trip, and his eyes brightened up wonderfully.    \"I'll be much obliged to you for the--the loan,\" he stammered.  \"I'll pay you back some time, remember.\"    \"Never mind about that,\" replied Dick.    \"My advice to you is, to take the first ship you can for home.\"    \"And what brought you out here--going on a hunt for your  father?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You'll have a big job finding him.  I understand the natives of  the Congo are going on the warpath before long.  They have had  some difficulty with the settlers.\"    \"I guess we'll manage to take care of ourselves,\" answered Tom,  and then he and his brothers followed their uncle up to the rooms  which had been engaged for them during their stay in the town.    \"He's, down in the mouth, and no mistake,\" was Tom's comment, when  the boys were left to themselves.  \"I never saw him so humble  before.\"    \"Perhaps knocking around has taught him a lesson,\" said Dick.  \"I  hope he really does turn over a new leaf.\"    The day proved to be a busy one.  Randolph Rover gathered all the  information he could concerning the trail along the Congo, and  also tried to locate Niwili Camp.  He likewise purchased several  additions to his outfits from Simon Hook, and engaged the services  of several natives, the leader of whom was a brawny black named  Cujo, a fellow who declared that he knew every foot of the  territory to be covered and who said he was certain that he could  locate King Susko sooner or later.    \"Him bad man,\" he said soberly.  \"No et him catch you, or you  suffer big lot!\"  Cujo took to Aleck from the start, and the pair  soon became warm friends.  The African inspected their outfits  with interest and offered several suggestions regarding additional  purchases.    Three days were spent in Boma, and during that time the Rovers saw  a good deal of Dan Baxter, who, having nothing better to do, hung  around them continually. He remained as meek as before, but our  friends did not know that this was merely the meekness of a savage  cur while under the whip.  Baxter was naturally a brute, and  lacked the backbone necessary far genuine reformation.    \"Say, why can't you take me with you?\" he asked, on the day that  the Rover expedition was to start out.  \"I'm willing to do my  share of the work and the fighting, and I won't charge you a cent  for my service.\"    \"I don't know as my uncle wants anybody along,\" said Sam, to whom  Baxter addressed his remarks.    \"Well, won't you speak to him about it, Sam?  I can't find  anything to do here, and the captains to whom I've applied don't  want me on their ships,\" pleaded the former bully of Putnam Hall.    Sam was easily touched at all times, and he knew that Baxter must  feel lonely and wretched so far from home and without friends or  capital.  He at once went to his brothers and his uncle and laid  the big youth's proposition before them.    \"We don't want him,\" said Dick promptly.    \"I don't believe he would be of any use to us.\"    \"I would rather give him some more money just for him to stay  behind,\" added Tom.    Mr. Rover was thoughtful for a moment.    \"And what do you say, Sam?\" he asked at length.    \"Well, I don't like Baxter any more than the others do.  But it  seems awfully hard on him.  I don't believe he knows how to turn.\"    \"We might give him enough money to get back to the United States  with.\"    \"I'd rather have you do that, Uncle Randolph,\" said Dick.  \"I  don't want him with me.\"    \"I will have a talk with the misguided boy,\" was the conclusion  reached by Randolph Rover; but he got no chance to speak to Dan  Baxter until late in the afternoon, and then, to his astonishment,  Baxter's manner had changed entirely, he intimating that he wanted  nothing more to do with them.    For in the meantime something which was bound to be of great  importance to the Rovers had occurred.  In Boma were a number of  persons of mixed French and native blood who were little better  than the old-time brigands of Italy.  They were led by a wicked  wretch who went by the name of Captain Villaire.  Villaire had  been watching the Rovers for two days when he noticed the coldness  which seemed to exist between, our friends and Baxter.  At once he  threw himself in Baxter's way and began to it pump the youth  regarding the Americans.    \"Zay are going into the interior, you have remarked,\" he said in  very bad English.  \"Are zay verra rich people?\"    \"Yes, they are well fixed,\" answered the tall youth.    \"And zay do carry zare money wid zem?\"    \"I guess not--at least, not much of it.\"    \"You are zare friend, eh?\"    \"Hardly.  Out in America we were enemies.\"    \"So?  You hata zem?\"    \"Yes, I hate them,\" muttered Dan, and his eyes shone wickedly.  \"I'm only treating them in a friendly way now because I'm out of  money and must do something.\"    \"I see.  It ees a good head you have--verra good,\" murmured  Captain Villaire.  \"Do you know, I heara dem talk about you?\"    \"Did you?  What did they say?\"    \"De one boy say you should be in ze jail; didn't you robba  somebody.\"    \"He had better keep his mouth shut.\"    \"You lika do somet'ing wid me?\" continued the French native,  closing one eye suggestively.  He was a close reader of human  nature and had read Baxter's character as if it was an open book.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"We gitta dem people into trouble--maka big lot of money.\"    \"All right--I'll do anything,\" answered Baxter savagely.  \"So  they said I ought to be in jail, eh?  I'll fix 'em yet!\"    \"You helpa me, I helpa you,\" went on the wily French native.    He had his plan all ready, and, after sounding Baxter some more,  revealed what was in his mind, which was simply to follow the  Rovers into the interior and then make them prisoners.  Once this  was done, they would hold the prisoners for a handsome ransom.    \"That's a big job,\" answered the big youth.  \"But I like your  plan, first-rate if you can carry it out.\"    \"Trust me,\" replied Captain Villaire.  \"I have half a dozen of ze  best of killowers-za, nevair fail me.  But as you knowa dem you  will have to do ze lettair writing for us, so zat we git ze money  from zare people at home.\"    \"Trust me for that,\" responded Baxter quickly.  The plot pleased  him immensely.   \"You do the capturing and I'll make Mrs. Rover or  somebody else pay up handsomely, never fear.\"    And so a compact was formed which was to give the Rovers a good  deal of trouble in the near future.          CHAPTER XVI    THE START UP THE CONGO      \"It was queer Dan Baxter should act so,\" said Sam to his uncle,  when Mr. Rover came back from his interview with the bully.  \"I  thought he wanted to, go the worst way.\"    \"He acted as if he had struck something else,\" answered Randolph  Rover.  \"He didn't even want the money I offered.  Perhaps he has  received a remittance from home.\"    \"Who would send it to him?\" put in Dick.  \"His father is still in  jail.\"    \"Perhaps he got Mumps to send it to him,\" said Sam.  \"But I  forgot, Mumps is away.\"    There was no time to discuss "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#14)"],[1," boys fight out their own battles.      The Rover boys had come to Putnam Hall in the fall, and now summer  sports were cast aside among the pupils, and football and hare and  hounds became the rage.    As we know, Sam was an excellent runner, and hare and hounds just  suited him.    \"We must ask the captain to let us take a long trip next Saturday  afternoon,\" he said; and the boys went to the owner of Putnam Hall  in a body and obtained permission.    It was decided that Sam and Fred should be the hares, while Larry  Colby was to be leading hound.  As Frank Harrington had a trumpet  he was made whipper-in.  Captain Putnam supplied the boys with a  package of old copying books, and these were cut up into small  bits and stuffed into two pillow cases loaned by Mrs. Green.    The start was made on a clear but frosty afternoon.  The hares  stood on the parade ground, with the hounds, to the number of  thirty, behind them.  George Strong had consented to start them  off.  The hares were to be given three minutes start of the little  scholars and five minutes start of the big boys.    \"All ready?\" asked the second assistant of Putnam Hall, as he took  out his watch.    \"All ready,\" answered Sam and Fred.    \"Then go!\"  And away went the two boys straight for the cornfield,  dropping bits of paper as they sped along.  They leaped the fence  in the rear, crossed the brook, and then started along a path  leading through the woods beyond.    \"We mustn't dream of letting them catch us,\" remarked Sam, as he  ran on, with Fred directly behind him.  \"I wonder where this path  leads to?\"    \"The top of the mountain, so Mr. Strong told me.  He said there  was another path coming down to the westward.\"    On and on they went along the path until they came to a narrow  mountain road.  Here they met a farmer carting a number of logs in  his wagon, and stopped him to ask a few questions.    \"Yes, that road will take you right up to the top,\" he said.  \"But  you want to be careful and not make a wrong turn, or you may get  lost.\"    \"I'm not afraid of being lost,\" said Fred with a light laugh; and  on they sped again, as rapidly as ever, for Fred was as good a  runner as Sam, and the pair worked very well together.    At the top of the first rise of ground they came to a spot that  was somewhat bare, and here they halted to look back.    \"There are the small fellows!\" cried Sam, pointing with his  finger.  \"And the big ones are not far behind.\"    \"They are speeding along in good shape,\" was Fred's comment. \"Come  on, before they spot us!\"  And they hurried up the next hill.  Here they encountered a number of rocks, and were brought to a  halt several times to determine which was the best path to pursue.    \"By jinks! the farmer was right--we are getting lost!\" said Sam  presently.    \"Where is the path?\"    \"I think it is to the right.\"    \"And I think it is to the left.\"    At this both lads looked at each other, then burst out laughing.    \"It can't be in both directions, Fred.\"    \"That's true, and I am sure I am right.\"    \"All right, we'll try it,\" and they did, but it was a good ten  minutes before the path came into view again, and meanwhile the  first of the hounds drew dangerously close.    But the game was by no means over, as we shall see.          CHAPTER XIII    WHAT THE GAME OF HARE AND HOUND LED TO      \"What a glorious view!\"    It was Sam who uttered the words.  The top of the mountain had  been reached at last, and the boys were feasting their eyes on the  grand panorama spread on all sides.    \"How beautiful the lake looks!\" said Fred.    \"And how far one can see!\"    \"It's a pity we didn't bring a pair of glasses with us, Fred.  But, say, I'm hungry.\"    \"So am I.  Let us eat that lunch at once and then start on the  return.\"    Each had brought a sandwich along, and these were soon consumed  and washed down with a drink of cold water from a spring not far  away.  Then on they went, over the top of the mountain, and along  a path which they thought would bring them around its western  base.  It was now four o'clock, leaving them two hours in which to  get back to Putnam Hall.    About a third of the distance down the mountain side had been  covered, and Sam was slightly in advance, when suddenly he uttered  a cry of alarm.    \"Look out, Fred!\"    \"What is it?\"    \"A snake!\"    \"Where?\"    \"Over yonder! And he is coming for us!\"    Sam was right; it was a snake--an angry looking reptile all of  six feet long, and as thick as Sam's wrist.  It hissed savagely as  it advanced, first upon Sam and then upon Fred.    If there was one thing which could fill Fred Garrison full of  terror it was a snake, and the yell he gave would have outmatched  that of an Indian on the warpath.    \"Save me!\" he screamed.  \"Don't let him touch me!\"  \"Jump back!\" cried Sam, and leaped himself.  Then, seeing a tall  rock handy, he sprang upon it, and here Fred joined him.    Now, it happened that the snake had its home under the rock, and  the movement of the lads made it more angry than ever.  With a  fierce hiss it came for the rock and disappeared underneath, out  of the range of their vision.    \"It's gone under the rock!\" panted Fred.  He was so agitated he  could scarcely speak.    \"I know it,\" returned Sam.  \"I wonder if it means to crawl up  here?\"    \"Oh, don't say that, Sam. I--I--can't we hit it with  something?\"    \"I  haven't a thing but the bag of paper.\"    \"Neither have I.  Oh, what shall we do?\"    \"Perhaps, we had better stay here until the others come up.\"    \"Do you think the snake will keep quiet that long?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know.\"    Very much disturbed, the two boys peered over the edge of the  rock.  They were not versed in the different species of reptiles,  and knew not but that the one at hand might be poisonous.    \"I see his tail!\" cried Fred with a shiver.    \"He is moving around as if getting ready to come out.\"    \"I wonder if I can grab him by the tail?\" mused Sam.    \"Grab him?  Oh Sam!\"    \"I've heard you can catch them by the tail, snap them, and make  their heads fly right off.\"    \"Gracious, I wouldn't attempt it!\"    While Fred was speaking the tail of the snake came up on the side  of the rock.  Setting his teeth, Sam bent down and made a reach  for the slippery thing, and caught it tight.    With a hiss the snake raised its head, its diamond-like eyes  shining like twin stars.    \"You'll be poisoned!\" shrieked Fred, when whack! Sam gave the  body of the reptile a swing and brought the head down with great  force on the edge of the rock.    One blow was enough, for the head was mashed flat.  Then Sam threw  the body into the bushes, there to quiver and twist for several  hours to come, although life was extinct.    Fred was as white as a sheet as he leaped to the ground.  \"I  couldn't have done that for a million dollars!\" he declared.  \"What a splendid nerve you have, Sam.\"    \"My father told me how to catch a snake in that way,\" exclaimed  Sam.  \"But hurry, or the hounds will overtake us.  I can hear them  coming.\"    \"Your father must have been equally brave, then,\" answered Fred,  as they started off on, a run.  \"By the way, have you heard  anything of him yet?\"    \"Not a word, Fred.\"    \"Don't it make you feel bad at times?\"    \"Does it, Fred!  Why, some nights I can't go to sleep for thinking  of where he may be--dead in the heart of Africa, or perhaps a  captive of some savage tribe.\"    \"Have they ever hunted for him?\"    \"Several have gone out, but no traces are to be had.  Dick, Tom,  and I are in to hunt for him, though, as soon as our Uncle  Randolph will permit it.\"    \"That's an idea.  But you may have to go right into the jungles  for him.\"    \"I don't care if we have to go to the top of the North Pole, if  only we find him,\" answered Sam with quiet determination.    Inside of half an hour the bottom of the mountain was gained, and  then they struck out along a road which presently took them within  sight of the Stanhope homestead.    \"I wonder if we have time to call on Dora?\" mused Fred.  \"It would  be a scheme to leave our paper trail right through their garden.\"    \"Glorious!\" burst from Sam, caught by the idea.  \"I am certain  Dora Stanhope will appreciate the sport.\"    It did not take them long to reach the garden around the  farmhouse; and, running up the path, they ascended a side porch.    As they did so two forms appeared around the house.  One was Mrs.  Stanhope, wearing a shawl over her shoulders and a bonnet on her  head, and the second was Josiah Crabtree!    \"Old Crabtree!\" murmured Sam, and then of a sudden he pulled Fred  out of sight behind some lattice-work inclosing one end of the  porch.    \"We must hurry, my dear, or we may be too late,\" Josiah Crabtree  was saying; and now the boys noted that he was conducting the lady  toward a carriage standing by the horse block.    \"I--I--had we not better wait until next week, Josiah?\"  questioned Mrs. Stanhope timidly.  She was a pale, delicate woman  of forty, of a shrinking nature, easily led by others.    \"No, my dear, there is no use in waiting.\"    \"But Dora--?\"    \"You must not mind what your daughter says, my dear.  When we are  married she will easily become reconciled to the change, mark my  words.\"    \"Gracious, old Crabtree is going to marry her!\" whispered Sam.  \"Poor Dora!\"    \"She wants me to wait,\" continued the lady.    \"And you ought to wait, mother,\" came in Dora's voice; and now she  too came into sight, but without a hat or wraps.    \"Mr. Crabtree wishes very much to have the ceremony performed this  afternoon, Dora dear.\"    \"If he wants to marry you, why can't he do it openly--at home or  in our church?\"    \"He is averse to any display.\"    \"It seems to me it is a very sneaking way to do,\" answered Dora  coldly.  \"When you and papa were married the wedding was well  attended, so I have been told.\"    \"Your father and myself are different persons, Miss Dora,\"  interrupted Josiah Crabtree"]]]
