[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#14)"],[1,"a  fresh history of a period already fully treated, by changing the order  and disposition of other men's works. He iterates his determination to  record only historical facts, and says, \"It is superfluous for me to  write about the Antiquities [i.e. the early history] of the Jews,  because many before me, both among my own people and the Greeks, have  composed the histories of our ancestors very exactly.\"[1] By the  Antiquities he means the Bible narrative. He proposes therefore to begin  where the Bible ends and, after a brief survey of the events before his  own age, to give a full account of the great Rebellion. Josephus falls  short of his promise. Many of the shortcomings he pointed to in his  predecessors are glaringly present in his work. Nor is it probable that  his profession of having taken notes on the spot is true. At the time of  the siege of Jerusalem he had no literary pretensions, and it is  unlikely that he contemplated the writing of a history. It has been  pointed out that his account is much more accurate in regard to events  in which he did not take part than in regard to those in which he  assisted.    [Footnote 1: B.J., Preface. The Greek name _Archaeologia_ is regularly  rendered by _Antiquities_, but it means simply the early history.]    In the first book and the greater part of the second, where he is taken  up with the preliminary introduction, he had ample sources before him,  and his functions were only to abstract and compile; but when he comes  to the final struggle with Rome, he would have us believe that he  depended mainly on his independent knowledge. Recent investigation has  thrown grave doubts on his claim, and has suggested that with Josephus  it is true that \"once a compiler, always a compiler.\" The habit of  direct copying from the works of predecessors was fixed in the literary  ethics of the day. In company with most of the historians of antiquity  he introduces his general ideas upon the march of events in the form of  addresses, which he puts into the mouth of the chief characters at  critical moments. Here he is free to invent and intrude his own  opinions, and here he almost unfailingly adopts a Roman attitude. The  work, in fact, bears the character of official history, and has all the  partiality of that form of literature. Titus, as the author proudly  recalls, subscribed his own hand to it, and ordered that it should be  published, and King Agrippa wrote a glowing testimonial to it in the  most approved style.[1] It was accepted in Rome as the standard work  upon the Jewish struggle. Patronage may have saved literature at certain  epochs, but it always undermines the feeling of truth. It is not  improbable that a juster appreciation of events was contained in the  original writings of Josephus, but was corrected at the order of the  royal traitor or the Imperial master, to whom he perforce submitted  them.    [Footnote 1: C. Ap. 8. See below, p. 221.]    If in the _Wars_ Josephus assumes the air of a scientific historian, in  the _Antiquities_ he is more openly the apologist. Despite his  professions in the preface of the earlier work, he seems to have found  it necessary or expedient to give to Greco-Roman society a fresh account  of the ancestry and the early history of his people and of the  constitution of their government. The Roman _Archaeologia_ of Dionysius  of Halicarnassus, who fifty years earlier had written in twenty books  the early events of Rome, probably suggested the division and the name  of the work. He issued it after the death of his protector, in the  thirteenth year of the reign of Domitian and in the fifty-sixth year of  his own life.[1] In the preface, inconsistently with the statement in  the earlier work, he declares that he intended from the beginning to  write this apology of his people, but was deterred for a time by the  magnitude of the labor of translating the history into an unaccustomed  tongue. He ascribes the impulse to carry out the task to the  encouragement of his patron Epaphroditus and of his other friends at  Rome. It probably came also from his circumstances at Rome and the  necessity of refuting calumnies made against him on account of his race  and religion. And with all his weaknesses and failings he was not  lacking in a feeling of national pride, which must have moved him to  defend his people.    [Footnote 1: Ant. XX. xi. 3.]    Following on the destruction of Jerusalem, a passion of mixed hatred and  contempt against the Jews moved the Roman nobility and the Roman masses.  The Flavian court, representing the middle classes, by no means shared  the feeling, and indeed the infatuation of Titus for the Jewish princess  Berenice, the sister of Agrippa, was one of the scandals that most  stirred the anger of the Romans. But the nobles hated those who had  obstinately fought against the Roman armies for four years, and scorned  those whose God had not saved them from ruin. At the same time Jewish  persistence after defeat and the continuance of Jewish missionary  activity offended the majesty of Rome, which, though tolerant of foreign  religious ideas, was accustomed not merely to the physical submission of  her enemies, but to their cultural and intellectual abasement. The  hatred and scorn were fanned by a tribe of scribblers, who heaped  distortion on the history and practices of the Jewish people. On the  other hand, the proselytes to Judaism, \"the fearers of God,\" who  accepted part of its teaching--and in the utter collapse of pagan  religion and morality they were many--desired to know something of the  past grandeur of the nation, and doubtless were anxious to justify  themselves to those who regarded their adoption of Jewish customs as an  utter degradation. For those who mocked at him as a renegade member of a  wretched people, which consisted of the scum of the earth, which  harbored all kinds of low superstition, and which fostered inhumanity  and misanthropy, and for those who looked to him as the accredited  exponent of Judaism and the writer most able to set it in a favorable  light, Josephus wrote the twenty books of his _Antiquities_.    The work differed from all previous apologies for Judaism in its  completeness and its historical character. Philo had sought to recommend  Judaism as a philosophical religion, and had interpreted the Torah as  the law of Nature. Josephus was concerned not so much with Judaism as  with the Jews. He seeks to show, by his abstract of historical records,  that his people had a long and honorable past, and that they had had  intercourse with ancient empires, and had been esteemed even by the  Romans. The _Antiquities_ comprised a summary of the whole of Jewish  history, as well that which was set out in the books of the Bible as  that which had taken place in the post-Biblical period down to his own  day. Some of his predecessors had elaborated only the former part of the  story, and that, it is probable, not nearly so fully as Josephus. He  claims not to have added to or diminished from the record of Scripture.  Though neither part of the claim can be upheld, he does undoubtedly give  a tolerable account of the Bible so far as it is an historical  narrative. The finer spirit of the Bible, even in its narrative parts,  its deep spiritual teaching, its simple grandeur, its arresting  sincerity, he was utterly unable to impart. In style, too, his Greek  falls immeasurably below the original. We feel as we read his abstract  with its omissions and additions:      The little more and how much it is;    The little less and what miles away.    His is a mediocre transcription, which replaces the naivete, the  rapidity, the unaffected beauty of the Hebrew, with the rhetoric, the  sophistication, and the exaggerated overstatement of the Greek writing  of his own time. Impressiveness for him is regularly enhanced by  inaccuracy. His own or his assumed materialistic fatalism lowers the God  of the Bible to a Power which materially rewards the righteous and  punishes the wicked. In this immediate retribution he finds the surest  sign of Divine Providence, and it is this lesson which he is most  anxious to assert throughout his work. But he is at pains to dispel the  idea of a special Providence for Israel. The material power of Rome made  him desert in life the Jewish cause; the material thought of Rome made  him dissimulate in literature the full creed of Judaism.    The second part of the _Antiquities_ is a more ambitious piece of work.  The compiler brings together all that he could find, in Jewish and  Gentile sources, about Jewish history from the time of the Babylonian  captivity to the outbreak of the war against Rome. And he was apparently  the first of his people to utilize the Greek historians systematically  in this fashion. There are long periods as to the incidents of which he  was at a loss. Without possessing the ability or desire for research, he  is not above confounding the chronology and perverting the succession of  events to cover up a gap. But he does contrive to produce a connected  narrative and to provide some kind of continuous chronicle. And for this  service he is not lightly to be esteemed. Without him we should know  scarcely anything of the external history of the Jewish people for three  centuries. In style the last ten books vary remarkably. It depends  almost entirely on his source whether the narrative is dull and  monotonous or lively and dramatic. Where, for example, he is  transcribing Nicholas and another historian of the period, he succeeds  in presenting a picture of Herod that has a certain psychological value.  Where, on the other hand, he has had to trust largely to scattered  notes, as in the record of Herod's successors, his history is little  better than a miscellany of disjointed passages. He lacks throughout a  true sense of proportion, and for the deeper aspects of history he has  no perception.

Now, you can guess why on the spur of the  moment I bought up your rights to dig in the Sudan, can't you?\"    \"I confess I can't,\" I said.    \"Why, I want you to take Colonel Corkran's place on the _Candace_ as  conductor. And I want you and your friend Fenton to go up Nile in  charge of the splendid steam dahabeah I've bought to supplement the  Mediterranean trip. There you have my motives in a nutshell!\"    I burst out laughing. \"A cracked nutshell,\" I remarked. Sir Marcus'  rosy face turned royal purple. \"What--you won't undertake it?\"    \"I couldn't,\" I assured him. \"For one thing, I'd be a fish out of  water. My dear sir, perhaps you don't know that my nickname since the  age of five has been 'Duffer?' I'm proud of it. I take pains to live up  to it----\"    \"I bet you do. I bet it opens doors and lays down velvet carpets for  you. Why, a duffer with a title is exactly what I want! Duffers are the  rage nowadays. You and your friend will make a brilliant pair, a fine  contrast, especially with your friend's present get up. If you'd both  been born for me you couldn't suit me better.\"    I laughed again. \"You said you ought to have launched out on belted  earls. We're humble----\"    \"There's no earls handy, and if there were any, they wouldn't be what  you two are in looks and talents, to say nothing of your brother being  a marquis. I'm offering you both the softest kind of job. All you have  to do is to be agreeable young gentlemen, with a knowledge of society,  and history; that means, you can be yourselves. You get a fine trip on  high salaries if you don't scorn to accept my money; and as a reward  for a good holiday you receive the right to explore your golden  mountain. I suppose you must think it _is_ a golden mountain, or you  wouldn't be such nuts on it. You'd better consult your friend before  you refuse my offer, anyhow.\"    \"Haven't you heard that Fenton's left Cairo?\" I took the precaution to  ask. \"That doesn't look as if he were entertaining the idea of going up  the Nile on your steam dahabeah.\" \"I have heard that he's left. But I  happen to know--it isn't so. I saw him standing in front of Shepheard's  Hotel this morning, waiting for you. I got on to what was in that green  turban before the pretty girl in white--Miss Gilder, I've found out  since--called him on to the terrace. Don't look as if you wanted to eat  me, Lord Ernest. I've won my way up from the bottom rung of the ladder  by keeping my eyes open, and by putting two and two together. I  specialize on that. I don't suppose there's another man in Cairo except  me and you, would have recognized Fenton, so you needn't worry. I  twigged that he'd dressed up for serious business, not for fun, because  I read about some smart coups he'd brought off by going among the  natives like one of themselves. I'm not a sneak, and I shan't revenge  myself by giving him away, even if you two do show me the frozen face.  Captain Fenton encouraged me to think he might consider my proposition  if you would, though he refused to influence your decision one way or  the other. Naturally I conclude that he could be on my Nile boat if he  wanted to, even if not in his own capacity as an officer. I'll take him  in his green turban. He makes the best looking Egyptian I ever saw, and  he'd go down with the ladies like hot cakes.\"    \"Sir Marcus,\" I smiled, \"you're one of the most amusing as well as the  sharpest men, if you'll allow me to say so, that I ever met. Whatever  happens I shall not forget this conversation.\"    \"I don't want you to forget it,\" he grinned, beginning to hope. \"Think  it over. We're the chance of a lifetime for each other. And remember  the Mountain of the Golden Pyramid.\" I rose, and he got up heavily.  \"When will you let me know?\" he asked.    I was tempted to reply that he must have taken Fenton's seeming  encouragement too seriously, that, mountain or no mountain, it was  practically impossible for us to accept his amazing proposition. But  suddenly I seemed to hear \"Antoun Effendi\" telling Miss Gilder that she  must wait for his decision until evening. He had said afterward, also,  that it depended on me. It was evident that he had a scheme of his own,  worked by wheels within wheels. He had consoled me after the first blow  by saying that all was not lost. And I had four months' leave from  duty. A lot could be done in four months. \"I will let you know before  night,\" I said to Sir Marcus Lark.          CHAPTER VII    THE REVELATIONS OF A RETIRED COLONEL      Fenton's orders were, when the Cairo business should be finished, to go  slowly up the Nile in native dress, and get at the truth of certain  rumours which had disturbed officialdom at Cairo. At Denderah, Luxor,  and two or three other places there had been \"incidents,\" small but  troublesome. English sightseers had complained of being hustled, and  even insulted by the inhabitants of several river towns, and it was  important to find out whether the Egyptians or the foreigners had been  more to blame; whether there were real symptoms of sedition, as  reported, or whether the young men of the suspected places had merely  resented with roughness some discourtesy of tactless tourists. Fenton  had seized upon the idea that, as Egyptian lecturer and conductor--a  sort of super-dragoman--on board Lark's Nile boat, he might find a  plausible pretext for his secret errand. \"Why do you travel?\" would be  the question he must expect from suspicious leaders of any plot that  might be hatching, if he journeyed from one Nile village to another  without the excuse of business. As a glorified conductor of a pleasure-trip  for a party of tourists his excuse would be readymade for him; but  he had been far from sure that I would fall in with Sir Marcus Lark's  plan, despite the bribe. He had wanted me to hear the whole story, the  whole project, from Sir Marcus' own lips; and in his uncertainty of the  result, he had thought of Miss Gilder as an attractive \"victim.\" There  she was, as he had said, presented to him by Providence. If I should  pour scorn upon the Lark suggestion, he might find it worth while to  guide the Gilded Girl and her friends on their Nile pilgrimage. He left  the question for me, and I decided to kill as many birds as possible  with one stone. The name of the yacht was in itself an incentive:  _Candace_--Queen of Meroee--our Meroee. She seemed to call, and to  promise good luck. We would accept Lark's terms, and enter his service  in return for a written agreement to hand over his ill-got digging  rights to us, whether or no we turned out to be satisfactory as guides.  We could but do our best, and at all events we should earn the reward  which we had looked upon as ours already. Anthony would play his double  part, serving the interests of government and those of Sir Marcus Lark.  As for Monny Gilder, why shouldn't she and her party become Lark's  passengers? The only reason against this \"inspiration\" (as Sir Marcus  would have called it), lay in the fact that Monny wished to engage a  private dahabeah. When she wished for a thing, it appeared that only a  miracle or a cataclysm could induce her to give it up for something  else suggested by an outsider. But when I mentioned this peculiarity to  Fenton, he was fired to punish the girl by forcing her compliance with  our will. She had treated him like a servant. She looked upon a man  supposedly of Egyptian blood, even though of princely birth, somewhat  as she looked upon an American \"nigger.\" True, Anthony Fenton had in  his veins but very few such drops. On his father's side he was all  English, and his mother had been more than two thirds Greek and  Italian. Nevertheless this spoilt girl had struck a blow at the pride  which went ever walking about the world with a chip lightly poised on  its shoulder. Anthony had no desire to poach on my preserves. At the  same time he yearned to show Miss Gilder that he could be her master,  not her servant.    Once Anthony and I had made up our minds, everything else arranged  itself with lightning speed. Sir Marcus, rejoicing in his ill-got  conquest of us, broke to me the news that I must go by the first ship  to the Piraeus, to meet the _Candace,_ and head off the recalcitrant  band of passengers. He flattered me by thinking that, if I took the  place of Colonel Corkran as conductor, they would abandon their plot to  desert the yacht at Alexandria. It was, according to Lark's secret  information, only the \"smart and would-be smart set\" who had combined  to spring this mine upon the management. The rest grumbled no more than  it was normal for all pleasure-pilgrims to grumble; and as, roughly  speaking, the contented travellers were all going on to Palestine after  a week's wild sightseeing in Cairo, the colonel might be allowed to  continue his voyage without the interruption of a \"row.\"    \"I should have had enough common sense at the start,\" growled Sir  Marcus with crude candour, \"to engage a lord for the Smart Set, and a  parson for the Ernest Inquirers. There's a world of difference catering  for a Set, and a Flock. The art is, to know it, and how to do it. Now  I've secured you, I'm all right with the S. S. and thanks be, I've a  young reformed missionary on board to shepherd the Flock. Now the  Reverend Watts will come in handy, herding his sheep through Palestine,  while the colonel swaggers and fancies he's bossing the show. It's the  Egypt lot I worry about: girls out for dukes, and dukes out for  dollars. Not that there's a darned duke on board, but there are some  who think they out-duke the dukes, and it's our business to humour 'em.  You just duff all you want to, Lord Ernest, they'll swallow anything  you do, like honey. Don't bother about a"]]]
