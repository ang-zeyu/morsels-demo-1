I must indeed confess that I do not in the least understand your  Lordship.  When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length and  BRIGHTNESS.  If the brightness disappears, the Line is extinguished,  and, as you say, ceases to occupy Space.  But am I to suppose that your  Lordship gives the brightness the title of a Dimension, and that what  we call \"bright\" you call \"high\"?    Stranger.  No, indeed.  By \"height\" I mean a Dimension like your  length: only, with you, \"height\" is not so easily perceptible, being  extremely small.    I.  My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test.  You say I have  a Third Dimension, which you call \"height.\"  Now, Dimension implies  direction and measurement.  Do but measure my \"height,\" or merely  indicate to me the direction in which my \"height\" extends, and I will  become your convert.  Otherwise, your Lordship's own understand must  hold me excused.    Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  I can do neither.  How shall I convince him?  Surely a plain statement of facts followed by ocular demonstration  ought to suffice.  --Now, Sir; listen to me.    You are living on a Plane.  What you style Flatland is the vast level  surface of what I may call a fluid, or in, the top of which you and  your countrymen move about, without rising above or falling below it.    I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid.  You call me a Circle; but in  reality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size  varying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one  placed on the top of the other.  When I cut through your plane as I am  now doing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly, call  a Circle.  For even a Sphere--which is my proper name in my own  country--if he manifest himself at all to an inhabitant of  Flatland--must needs manifest himself as a Circle.    Do you not remember--for I, who see all things, discerned last night  the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain--do you not  remember, I say, how when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were  compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a  Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent  the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you?  In precisely the  same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to  represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section  of me, which is what you call a Circle.    The diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity.  But now  prepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions.  You  cannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;  for you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland;  but you can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my sections  become smaller.  See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye  will be that my Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles  to a point and finally vanishes.    There was no \"rising\" that I could see; but he diminished and finally  vanished.  I winked once or twice to make sure that I was not dreaming.  But it was no dream.  For from the depths of nowhere came forth a  hollow voice--close to my heart it seemed--\"Am I quite gone?  Are you  convinced now?  Well, now I will gradually return to Flatland and you  shall see my section become larger and larger.\"    Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious  Guest was speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity.  But  to me, proficient though I was in Flatland Mathematics, it was by no  means a simple matter.  The rough diagram given above will make it  clear to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three  positions indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or  to any Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and  at last very small indeed, approaching to a Point.  But to me, although  I saw the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever.  All that I  could comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and  vanished, and that he had now re-appeared and was rapidly making  himself larger.    When he regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he  perceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend him.  And indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be no Circle  at all, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that the old wives'  tales were true, and that after all there were such people as  Enchanters and Magicians.    After a long pause he muttered to himself, \"One resource alone remains,  if I am not to resort to action.  I must try the method of Analogy.\"  Then followed a still longer silence, after which he continued our  dialogue.    Sphere.  Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward, and  leaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?    I.  A straight Line.    Sphere.  And a straight Line has how many extremities?    I.  Two.    Sphere.  Now conceive the Northward straight Line moving parallel to  itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind it the  wake of a straight Line.  What name will you give to the Figure thereby  formed?  We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal to the  original straight line. --What name, I say?    I.  A square.    Sphere.  And how many sides has a Square?  How many angles?    I.  Four sides and four angles.    Sphere.  Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square  in Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.    I.  What?  Northward?    Sphere.  No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.    If it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square would have to  move through the positions previously occupied by the Northern points.  But that is not my meaning.    I mean that every Point in you--for you are a Square and will serve the  purpose of my illustration--every Point in you, that is to say in what  you call your inside, is to pass upwards through Space in such a way  that no Point shall pass through the position previously occupied by  any other Point; but each Point shall describe a straight Line of its  own.  This is all in accordance with Analogy; surely it must be clear  to you.    Restraining my impatience--for I was now under a strong temptation to  rush blindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space, or out of  Flatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him--I replied:--    \"And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out by  this motion which you are pleased to denote by the word 'upward'?  I  presume it is describable in the language of Flatland.\"    Sphere.  Oh, certainly.  It is all plain and simple, and in strict  accordance with Analogy--only, by the way, you must not speak of the  result as being a Figure, but as a Solid.  But I will describe it to  you.  Or rather not I, but Analogy.    We began with a single Point, which of course--being itself a  Point--has only ONE terminal Point.    One Point produces a Line with TWO terminal Points.    One Line produces a Square with FOUR terminal Points.    Now you can give yourself the answer to your own question:  1, 2, 4,  are evidently in Geometrical Progression.  What is the next number?    I.  Eight.    Sphere.  Exactly.  The one Square produces a SOMETHING-WHICH-YOU-  DO-NOT-AS-YET-KNOW-A-NAME-FOR-BUT-WHICH-WE-CALL-A-CUBE with EIGHT  terminal Points.  Now are you convinced?    I.  And has this Creature sides, as well as Angles or what you call  \"terminal Points\"?    Sphere.  Of course; and all according to Analogy.  But, by the way, not  what YOU call sides, but what WE call sides.  You would call them  SOLIDS.    I.  And how many solids or sides will appertain to this Being whom I am  to generate by the motion of my inside in an \"upward\" direction, and  whom you call a Cube?    Sphere.  How can you ask?  And you a mathematician!  The side of  anything is always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing.  Consequently, as there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0  sides; a Line, if I may so say, has 2 sides (for the points of a Line  may be called by courtesy, its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4;  what Progression do you call that?    I.  Arithmetical.    Sphere.  And what is the next number?    I.  Six.    Sphere.  Exactly.  Then you see you have answered your own question.  The Cube which you will generate will be bounded by six sides, that is  to say, six of your insides.  You see it all now, eh?    \"Monster,\" I shrieked, \"be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no  more will I endure thy mockeries.  Either thou or I must perish.\"  And  saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.          SECTION 17  How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to  deeds      It was in vain.  I brought my hardest right angle into violent  collision with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to  have destroyed any ordinary Circle:  but I could feel him slowly and  unarrestably slipping from my contact; not edging to the right nor to  the left, but moving somehow out of the world, and vanishing into  nothing.  Soon there was a blank.  But still I heard the Intruder's  voice.    Sphere.  Why will you refuse to listen to reason?  I had hoped to find  in you--as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician--a  fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed  to preach once only in a thousand years:  but now I know not how to  convince you.  Stay, I have it.  Deeds, and not words, shall proclaim  the truth.  Listen, my friend.    I have told you I can see from my position in Space the inside of all  things that you consider closed.  For example, I see in yonder cupboard  near which you are standing, several of what you call boxes (but like  everything else in Flatland, they have no tops or bottom) full of  money; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#14)"],[1,",\" muttered McTee, balling his fist, \"but I'll  freshen his memory.\"    He flushed as he became aware of the cold eye of Henshaw upon him.    \"Even Samson fell,\" said the old man. \"But she hasn't cut your hair  yet, McTee?\"    \"What the devil do you mean?\"    Henshaw silently poured another drink and passed it to the Scotchman.  The latter gripped the glass hard and tossed off the drink with a  single gesture. At once his eyes came back to Henshaw's face with the  fierce question. He was astonished to note kindliness in the answering  gaze.    Old Henshaw said gently: \"Tut, tut! You're a proper man, McTee, and a  proper man has always the thought of some woman tucked away in his  heart. Look at me! For almost sixty years I've been the King of the  South Seas!\"    At the thought of his glories his face altered, as soldiers change when  they receive the order to charge.    \"You're a rare man and a bold man, McTee, but you'll never be what  White Henshaw has been--the Shark of the Sea! Ha! Yet think of it! Ten  years ago, after all my harvesting of the sea, I had not a dollar to  show for it! Why? Because I was working for no woman. But here I am  sailing home from my last voyage--rich! And why? Because for ten years  I've been working for a woman. For ourselves we make and we spend. But  for a woman we make and we save. Aye!\"    \"For a woman?\" repeated McTee, wondering. \"Do you mean to say--\"    \"Tut, man, it's my granddaughter. Look!\"    Perhaps the whisky had loosened the old man's tongue; perhaps these  confidences were merely a tribute to the name and fame of McTee; but  whatever was the reason, McTee knew he was hearing things which had  never been spoken before. Now Henshaw produced a leather wallet from  which he selected two pictures, and handed one to the Scotchman. It  showed a little girl of some ten years with her hair braided down her  back. McTee looked his question.    \"That picture was sent to me by my son ten years ago.\"    It showed the effect of time and rough usage. The edges of the cheap  portrait were yellow and cracked.    \"He was worthless, that son of mine. So I shut him out of my mind until  I got a letter saying he was about to die and giving his daughter into  my hands. That picture was in the letter. Ah, McTee, how I pored over  it! For, you see, I saw the face of my wife in the face of the little  girl, Beatrice. She had come back to life in the second generation. I  suppose that happens sometimes.    \"I made up my mind that night to make a fortune for little Beatrice.  First I sold my name and honor to get a half share and captaincy of a  small tramp freighter. Then I went to the Solomon Islands. You know  what I did there? Yes, the South Seas rang with it. It was brutal, but  it brought me money.    \"I sent enough of that money to the States to keep the girl in luxury.  The rest of it I put back into my trading ventures. I got a larger  boat. I did unheard-of things; and everything I touched turned into  gold. All into gold!    \"From time to time I got letters from Beatrice. First they were careful  scrawls which said nothing. Then the handwriting grew more fluent. It  alarmed me to notice the growth of her mind; I was afraid that when I  finally saw her, she would see in me only a barbarian. So I educated  myself in odd hours. I've read a book while a hurricane was standing my  ship on her beam ends.\"    McTee, leaning forward with a frown of almost painful interest,  understood. He saw it in the wild light of the old man's eyes; a  species of insanity, this love of the old man for the child he had  never seen.    \"Notice my language now? Never a taint of the beach lingo in it. I  rubbed all that out. Aye, McTee, it took me ten years to educate myself  for that girl's sake. In the meantime, I made money, as I've said. Ten  years of that!    \"Beatrice was in college, and six months ago I got the word that she  had graduated. A month later I heard that she was going into a decline.  It was nothing very serious, but the doctors feared for the strength of  her lungs. It made me glad. Now I knew that she would need me. An old  man is like a woman, McTee; he needs to have things dependent on him.    \"I turned everything I had into cash. I did it so hurriedly that I must  have lost close to twenty per cent on the forced sales. What did I  care? I had enough, and I made myself into a grandfather who could meet  Beatrice's educated friends on their own level.    \"I kept this old ship, the _Heron_, out of the list of my boats. I am  going back to Beatrice with gold in my hands and gold in my brain! All  for her. But is she not worth it? Look!\"    He thrust the second portrait into McTee's hands. It showed a rather  thin-faced girl with abnormally large eyes and a rather pathetic smile.  It was an appealing face rather than a pretty one.    \"Beautiful!\" said McTee with forced enthusiasm.    \"Yes, beautiful! A little pinched, perhaps, but she'll fill out as she  grows older. And those are her grandmother's eyes! Aye!\"    He took the photograph and touched it lightly.    His voice grew lower, and the roughness was plainly a tremolo now: \"The  doctors say she's sick, a little sick, quite sick, in fact. Twice every  day I make them send me wireless reports of her condition. One day it's  better--one day it's worse.\"    He began to walk the cabin, his step marvelously elastic and nervous  for so aged a man.    \"Is it not well, McTee? Let her be at death's door! I shall come to her  bedside with gold in either hand and raise her up to life! She shall  owe everything to me! Will that not make her love me? Will it?\"    He grasped McTee's shoulder tightly.    \"I'm not a pretty lad to look at, eh, lad?\"    McTee poured himself a drink hastily, and drained the glass before he  answered.    \"A pretty man? Nonsense, Henshaw! A little weather-beaten, but a tight  craft at that; she'll worship the ground you walk! Character, Henshaw,  that's what these new American girls want to see in a man!\"    Henshaw sighed with deep relief.    \"Ah-h, McTee, you comfort me more than a drink on a stormy night! For  reward, you shall see what I'm bringing back to her. Come!\"    He rose and led McTee into his bedroom, for two cabins were retained  for the captain's use. Filling one corner of the room was a huge safe  almost as tall as a man.    He squatted before the safe and commenced to work the combination with  a swift sureness which told McTee at once that the old buccaneer came  here many times a day to gloat over his treasure. At length the door of  the safe fell open. Inside was a great mass of little canvas bags.  McTee was panting as if he had run a great distance at full speed.    \"Take one.\"    The Scotchman raised one of the bags and shook it. A musical clinking  sounded.    \"Forty pounds of gold coin,\" said Henshaw, \"and about ten thousand  dollars in all. There are eighty-five of those bags, and every one  holds the same amount. Also--\"    He opened a little drawer at the top of the safe and took from it a  chamois bag. When he untied it, McTee looked within and saw a quantity  of pearls. He took out a small handful. They were chosen jewels,  flawless, glowing. His hand seemed to overflow with white fire. He  dropped them back in the bag, letting each pearl run over the end of  his fingers. Henshaw restored the bag and locked the safe. Then the two  men stared at each other. They had been opposite types the moment  before, but now their lips parted in the same thirsty eagerness.    \"If she were dead,\" said McTee almost reverently, \"the sight of that  would bring her back to life.\"    \"McTee, you're a worthy lad. They've told me lies about you. Indeed it  would bring her back to life! It must be so! And yet--\" Sudden  melancholy fell on him as they returned to the other room and sat down.  \"Yet I think night and day of what an old devil of a black magician  told me in the Solomon Islands. He said I and my gold should burn  together. I laughed at him and told him I could not die on dry land. He  said I would not, but that I should burn at sea! Think of that, McTee!  Suppose I should be robbed of the sight of my girl and of my gold at  the same time!\"    McTee started to say something cheerful, but his voice died away to a  mutter. Henshaw was staring at the wall with visionary eyes filled with  horror and despair.    \"Lad, do you think ghosts have power?\"    \"Henshaw, you've drunk a bit too much!\"    \"If they have no power, I'm safe. I fear no living man!\" He added  softly: \"No man but myself!\"    \"I'm tired out,\" said McTee suddenly. \"Where shall I bunk, captain?\"    \"Here! Here in this room! Take that couch in the corner over there. It  has a good set of springs. With gold in my hands. Here are some  blankets. With gold in my hands and my brain. Though you don't need  much covering in this latitude. I would raise her from the grave.\"    He went about, interspersing his remarks to McTee with half-audible  murmurs addressed to his own ears.    \"Is this,\" thought McTee, \"the Shark of the South Seas?\"    A knock came and the door opened. A fat sailor in an oilskin hat stood  at the entrance.    \"The cook ain't put out no lunch for the night watches, sir,\" he  whined.    Henshaw had stood with his back turned as the door opened. He turned  now slowly toward the open door. McTee could not see his face nor guess  at its expression, but the moment the big sailor caught a glimpse of  his skipper's countenance, he blanched and jumped back into the night,  slamming the door behind him. That sight recalled something to McTee.    \"One thing more, captain,\" he said. \"What of Harrigan? Do we break him  between us?\"    \"Aye, in your own way!\"    \"Good! Then start him scrubbing the bridge and send him down to the  fireroom afterwards, eh?\"    \"It's done. Why do you hate him, McTee? Is it the girl?\"    \"No; the color of his hair. Good night.\"          CHAPTER 17      Long before this, Harrigan had reported to the bos'n,"]]]
