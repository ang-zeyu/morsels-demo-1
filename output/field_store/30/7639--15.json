A failure in a cotton deal not only cured her of this taste, but seems  to have marked the point in her career when her thoughts began to turn  to parsimony. Until then she had lived in some state, but now,  gradually at first, then swiftly, she began to cut down her expenses.  Now we find her in an apartment in West Central Park, next in a  Washington Square hotel, then in a Harlem flat, and finally--her last,  fixed abiding-place--in a small cottage on Staten Island.    It was a curious life that she led, this woman who could have bought  kingdoms if she had willed it. A Swedish maid-of-all-work was her only  companion. By day she would walk in her little garden, or dust, arrange  and wind up her clocks. At night, she would knit, or read one of the  frequent reports that arrived at the cottage from charity workers on  the East Side. Those were her two hobbies, and her only  extravagances--clocks and charity.    Her charity had its limitations. In actual money she expended little.  She was a theoretical philanthropist. She lent her influence, her time,  and her advice, but seldom her bank balance. Arrange an entertainment  for the delectation of the poor, and you would find her on the  platform, but her name would not be on the list of subscribers to the  funds. She would deliver a lecture on thrift to an audience of factory  girls, and she would give them a practical example of what she  preached.    Yet, with all its limitations, her charity was partly genuine. Her mind  was like a country in the grip of civil war. One-half of her sincerely  pitied the poor, burned at any story of oppression, and cried \"Give!\"  but the other cried \"Halt!\" and held her back, and between the two she  fell.           *       *       *       *       *    It was to this somewhat unpromising haven of refuge that Betty's mind  now turned in her trouble. She did not expect great things. She could  not have said exactly what she did expect. But, at least, the cottage  on Staten Island offered a resting-place on her journey, even if it  could not be the journey's end. Her mad dash from Mervo ceased to be  objectless. It led somewhere.          CHAPTER XI    A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION      New York, revisited, had much the same effect on Betty as it had had on  John during his first morning of independence. As the liner came up the  bay, and the great buildings stood out against the clear blue of the  sky, she felt afraid and lonely. That terror which is said to attack  immigrants on their first sight of the New York sky-line came to her,  as she leaned on the rail, and with it a feeling of utter misery. By a  continual effort during the voyage she had kept her thoughts from  turning to John, but now he rose up insistently before her, and she  realized all that had gone out of her life.    She rebelled against the mad cruelty of the fate which had brought them  together again. It seemed to her now that she must always have loved  him, but it had been such a vague, gentle thing, this love, before that  last meeting--hardly more than a pleasant accompaniment to her life,  something to think about in idle moments, a help and a support when  things were running crosswise. She had been so satisfied with it, so  content to keep him a mere memory. It seemed so needless and wanton to  destroy her illusion.    Of love as a wild-beast passion, tearing and torturing quite ordinary  persons like herself, she had always been a little sceptical. The great  love poems of the world, when she read them, had always left her with  the feeling that their authors were of different clay from herself and  had no common meeting ground with her. She had seen her friends fall in  love, as they called it, and it had been very pretty and charming, but  as far removed from the frenzies of the poets as an amateur's snapshot  of Niagara from the cataract itself. Elsa Keith, for instance, was  obviously very fond and proud of Marvin, but she seemed perfectly  placid about it. She loved, but she could still spare half an hour for  the discussion of a new frock. Her soul did not appear to have been  revolutionized in any way.    Gradually Betty had come to the conclusion that love, in the full sense  of the word, was one of the things that did not happen. And now, as if  to punish her presumption, it had leaped from hiding and seized her.    There was nothing exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now. They  ceased to be inhabitants of another world, swayed by curiously complex  emotions. They were her brothers--ordinary men with ordinary feelings  and a strange gift for expressing them. She knew now that it was  possible to hate the man you loved and to love the man you hated, to  ache for the sight of someone even while you fled from him.    It did not take her long to pass the Customs. A small grip constituted  her entire baggage. Having left this in the keeping of the amiable  proprietor of a near-by delicatessen store, she made her way to the  ferry.    Her first enquiry brought her to the cottage. Mrs. Oakley was a  celebrity on Staten Island.    At the door she paused for a moment, then knocked.    The Swede servant, she who had been there at her former visit, twelve  years ago, received her stolidly. Mrs. Oakley was dusting her clocks.    \"Ask her if she can see me,\" said Betty. \"I'm--\" great step-niece  sounded too ridiculous--\"I'm her niece,\" she said.    The handmaid went and returned, stolid as ever. \"Ay tal her vat yu say  about niece, and she say she not knowing any niece,\" she announced.    Betty amended the description, and presently the Swede returned once  more, and motioned her to enter.    Like so many scenes of childhood, the room of the clocks was sharply  stamped on Betty's memory, and, as she came into it now, it seemed to  her that nothing had changed. There were the clocks, all round the  walls, of every shape and size, the big clocks with the human faces and  the small, perky clocks. There was the dingy, medium-sized clock that  held the trumpeter. And there, looking at her with just the old  sandy-cat expression in her pale eyes, was Mrs. Oakley.    Even the possession of an income of eighteen million dollars and a  unique collection of clocks cannot place a woman above the making of  the obvious remark.    \"How you have grown!\" said Mrs. Oakley.    The words seemed to melt the chill that had gathered around Betty's  heart. She had been prepared to enter into long explanations, and the  knowledge that these would not be required was very comforting.    \"Do you remember me?\" she exclaimed.    \"You are the little girl who clapped her hands at the trumpeter, but  you are not little now.\"    \"I'm not so very big,\" said Betty, smiling. She felt curiously at home,  and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to  forget her own troubles.    \"You look pretty when you smile,\" said Mrs. Oakley thoughtfully. She  continued to look closely at her. \"You are in trouble,\" she said.    Betty met her eyes frankly.    \"Yes,\" she said.    The old woman bent her head over a Sevres china clock, and stroked it  tenderly with her feather duster.    \"Why did you run away?\" she asked without looking up.    Betty had a feeling that the ground was being cut from beneath her  feet. She had expected to have to explain who she was and why she had  come, and behold, both were unnecessary. It was uncanny. And then the  obvious explanation occurred to her.    \"Did my stepfather cable?\" she asked.    Mrs. Oakley laid down the feather duster and, opening a drawer,  produced some sheets of paper--to the initiated eye plainly one of Mr.  Scobell's lengthy messages.    \"A wickedly extravagant cable,\" she said, frowning at it. \"He could  have expressed himself perfectly well at a quarter of the expense.\"    Betty began to read. The dimple on her chin appeared for a moment as  she did so. The tone of the message was so obsequious. There was no  trace of the old peremptory note in it. The words \"dearest aunt\"  occurred no fewer than six times in the course of the essay, its author  being apparently reckless of the fact that it was costing him half a  dollar a time. Mrs. Oakley had been quite right in her criticism. The  gist of the cable was, \"_Betty has run away to America dearest aunt  ridiculous is sure to visit you please dearest aunt do not encourage  her_.\" The rest was pure padding.    Mrs. Oakley watched her with a glowering eye. \"If Bennie Scobell,\" she  soliloquized, \"imagines that he can dictate to me--\" She ceased,  leaving an impressive hiatus. Unhappy Mr. Scobell, convicted of  dictation even after three dollars' worth of \"dearest aunt!\"    Betty handed back the cable. Her chin, emblem of war, was tilted and  advanced.    \"I'll tell you why I ran away, Aunt,\" she said.    Mrs. Oakley listened to her story in silence. Betty did not relate it  at great length, for with every word she spoke, the thought of John  stabbed her afresh. She omitted much that has been told in this  chronicle. But she disclosed the essential fact, that Napoleonic Mr.  Scobell had tried to force her into a marriage with a man she did  not--she hesitated at the word--did not respect, she concluded.    Mrs. Oakley regarded her inscrutably for a while before replying.    \"Respect!\" she said at last. \"I have never met a man in my life whom I  could respect. Harpies! Every one of them! Every one of them! Every one  of them!\"    She was muttering to herself. It is possible that her thoughts were  back with those persevering young aristocrats of her second widowhood.  Certainly, if she had sometimes displayed a touch of the pirate in her  dealings with man, man, it must be said in fairness, had not always  shown his best side to her.    \"Respect!\" she muttered again. \"Did you like him, this Prince of  yours?\"    Betty's eyes filled. She made no reply.    \"Well, never mind,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"Don't cry, child! I'm not going  to press you.
