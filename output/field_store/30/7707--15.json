After Constantine's pretended conversion to Christianity, and the time  for the fulfillment of the prophecies had been put off to the year  10000, as previously stated, the hierarchy of the church appealed to  the Emperor to give them a Sabbath, and although they knew that the  seventh day of the week was the Sabbath of the Old Testament, and that  Sunday was the first of the six working days, according to the fourth  commandment, their hatred to the Jews for refusing to accept their  Christ as the Saviour induced them to have it placed on the first day  of the week. Hence that obliging potentate, in the year 321,  promulgated the memorable edict, which, found in that Digest of Roman  law known as the Justinian Code, Book III., Title 12, Sec. 2 and 3,  reads as follows, viz.: \"Let all judges and all people of the towns  rest and all the various trades be suspended on the venerable day of  the Sun. Those who live in the country, however, may freely and without  fault attend to the cultivation of their fields lest, with the loss of  favorable opportunity, the commodities offered by Divine Providence  shall be destroyed.\" Thus we see that the primary movement towards  enforcing the observance of Sunday, or Lord's Day, as the Sabbath, did  not originate in a Divine command, but in the edict of an earthly  potentate.    This edict was ratified at the third council of Orleans, in the year  538; and in order, \"that the people might not be prevented from  attending church, and saying their prayers,\" a resolution was adopted  at the same time recommending the observance of the day by all classes.  From merely \"recommending,\" the Church of Rome soon began to enforce  the observance of the day; but, in spite of all her efforts, it was not  until the 12th century that its observance had become so universal as  to receive the designation of \"The Christian Sabbath.\"    Cognizant of the manner in which Sunday was made the Sabbath, Luther  issued for the government of the Protestant communion the following  mandate: \"As for the Sabbath, or Sunday, there is no necessity for  keeping it;\" see Michelet's Life of Luther, Book IV., chapter 2. Luther  also said, as recorded in Table Talk, \"If anywhere the day (Sunday) is  made holy for the mere day's sake; if anywhere anyone sets up its  observance upon a Jewish foundation, then I order you to work on it, to  dance on it, to ride on it, to feast on it, and to do anything that  shall reprove this encroachment on the Christian spirit of liberty.\"  Melancthon, Luther's chief coadjutor in the work of Reformation,  denied, in the most emphatic language, that Sunday was made the Sabbath  by Divine ordainment; and in reference thereto John Milton, in reply to  the Sunday Sabbatarians, makes the pertinent inquiry: \"If, on a plea of  Divine command, you impose upon us the observance of a particular day,  how do you presume, without the authority of a Divine command, to  substitute another in its place?\"    During the reign of Elizabeth, Queen of England, a sect of fanatics,  known as Dissenters or Nonconformists, basing their action upon the  fallacious arguments derived from the fourth commandment, and upon the  plea that the Saviour was raised from the dead on the first day of the  week, inaugurated what is known as the Puritan Sabbath, which having  been transferred to our shores by the voyagers in the Mayflower, and  enforced by those statutory enactments known as Blue Laws, caused the  people of New England to have a blue time of it while the delusion  lasted; and now a large body of Protestant clergy perverting the  teachings of scripture, and, ignoring the authority of the Reformers,  are disturbing the peace of society by their efforts to enforce the  code of sundry laws, which were enacted through their connivance. Thus  have we shown that, originating with the Catholics and adopted by the  Protestants, the Sunday Sabbath is purely and entirely a human  institution, and, being such, we must recognize all Sunday laws as  grave encroachments upon constitutional liberty; and it behooves the  advocates of individual rights to demand their immediate repeal; for  unless a vigilant watch is kept upon the conspirators who secured their  enactment, our fair land will soon be cursed by a union of church and  State, the tendency in that direction having been indicated by the  unprecedented opinion recently handed down by one of the Justices of  the United States Supreme Court that this is a Christian Government.        PIOUS FRAUDS.    By claiming to be divinely appointed for the propagation of a divinely  authenticated religion, the priesthood of all forms of worship have  ever labored to deceive and enslave the ignorant multitude; and in  support of these fallacious assumptions have resorted to all manner of  pious frauds, in reference to which we quote from both Pagan and  Christian sources with the view to showing that the moderns have  faithfully followed the ancient example. Euripedes, an Athenian writer,  who flourished about 450 years before the beginning of our era,  maintained that, \"in the early state of society, some wise men insisted  on the necessity of darkening truth with falsehood and of persuading  men that there is an immortal deity who hears and sees and understands  our actions, whatever we may think of that matter ourselves.\" Strabo,  the famous geographer and historian of Greek extraction, who flourished  about the beginning of the Christian era, wrote that \"It is not  possible for a philosopher to conduct by reasoning a multitude of women  and the low vulgar, and thus to invite them to piety, holiness and  faith; but the philosopher must make use of superstition and not omit  the invention of fables and the performance of wonders. For the  lightning and the aegis and the trident are but fables, and so all  ancient theology. But the founders of states adopted them as bugbears  to frighten the weak-minded.\" Varro, a learned Roman scholar, who also  flourished about the beginning of our era, wrote that \"There are many  truths which it is useless for the vulgar to know, and many falsehoods  which it is fit that the people should not know are falsehoods.\"    So much from Pagan authorities relative to the necessity of deceiving  the ignorant masses. We will now present some Christian authorities  upon the same subject; and first from Christ himself, who in addressing  his disciples is made to say, in Mark iv, 11, 12, \"Unto you it is given  to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are  without all these things are done in parables, that seeing they may see  and not perceive; and hearing they may hear and not understand.\" Paul,  in his fourteen Epistles, inculcates and avows the principle of  deceiving the common people. He speaks of having been upbraided by his  own converts with being crafty and catching them with guile and of his  known and wilful lies abounding to the glory of God. See Romans iii. 7,  and II. Cor. xii. 16. If Christ and Paul were guilty of deception,  their followers had good excuse for the same course of conduct. Upon  this subject Beausobre, a very learned ecclesiastical writer, who  flourished about the beginning of the 18th century, says: \"We see in  the history which I have related a sort of hypocrisy that has been,  perhaps, but too common at all times; that churchmen not only do not  say what they think, but they do say the direct contrary of what they  think. Philosophers in their cabinets; out of them they are content  with fables, though they well know that they are fables.\" Historie de  Manichee, vol. 2, page 568. Bishop Synesius, the distinguished author  of religious literature and Christian father of the 5th century, said:  \"I shall be a philosopher only to myself, and I shall always be a  bishop to the people.\" Mosheim, the distinguished author of  Ecclesiastical History, Vol. I., page 120, says: \"The authors who have  treated of the innocence and sanctity of the primitive Christians have  fallen into the error of supposing them to have been unspotted models  of piety and virtue, and a gross error indeed it is, as the strongest  testimonies too evidently prove.\" The same author, in Vol. I., page.  198, says in the fourth century \"it was an almost universally adopted  maxim that it was an act of virtue to deceive and lie, when by such  means the interest of the church might be promoted.\" In his  Ecclesiastical History, Vol. II., page 11, he says that \"as regards the  fifth century, the simplicity and ignorance of the generality in those  times furnished the most favorable occasion for the exercise of fraud;  and the impudence of impostors in contriving false miracles was  artfully proportioned to the credulity of the vulgar; while the  sagacious and the wise, who perceived these cheats, were overawed into  silence by the dangers that threatened their lives and fortunes if they  should expose the artifice.\" Thomas Burnet, D.D., who flourished about  the beginning of the 18th century, in his treatise entitled De Statu  Mortuorum, purposely written in Latin that it might serve for the  instruction of the clergy only, and not come to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#14)"],[1,"ms. Certainly few woodland dwellers have more delicately beautiful  foliage than the fumitory tribe.      Squirrel Corn    _Dicentra canadensis_    _Flowers_--Irregular, greenish white tinged with rose, slightly  fragrant, heart-shaped, with 2 short rounded spurs, more than 1/2 in.  long, nodding on a slender Calyx of 2 scale-like sepals; corolla  heart-shaped at base, consisting of 4 petals in 2 united pairs, a  prominent crest on tips of inner ones; 6 stamens in 2 sets; style with  2-lobed stigma. _Scape_; Smooth, 6 to 12 in. high, the rootstock bearing  many small, round, yellow tubers like kernels of corn. _Leaves_: All  from root, delicate, compounded of 3 very finely dissected divisions.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Virginia, and westward to the  Mississippi.    Any one familiar with the Bleeding-heart _(Dicentra eximia)_ of  old-fashioned gardens, found growing wild in the Alleghanies, and with  the exquisite White Mountain Fringe _(Adlumia fungosa)_ often brought  from the woods to be planted over shady trellises, or with the  Dutchman's breeches, need not be told that the little squirrel corn is  next of kin or far removed from the Pink Corydalis. It is not until we  dig up the plant and look at its roots that we see why it received its  name. A delicious perfume like hyacinths, only fainter and subtler,  rises from the dainty blossoms.          MUSTARD FAMILY _(Cruciferae)_      Shepherd's Purse; Mother's Heart    _Capsella Bursa-pastoris_    _Flowers_--Small, white, in a long, loose raceme, followed by triangular  and notched (somewhat heart-shaped) pods, the valves boat-shaped and  keeled. Sepals and petals 4; stamens 6; 1 pistil. _Stem:_ 6 to 18 in.  high, from a deep root. _Leaves:_ Forming a rosette at base, 2 to 5 in.  long, more or less cut (pinnatifid), a few pointed, arrow-shaped leaves  also scattered along stem and partly clasping it.    _Preferred Habitat_--Fields, roadsides, waste places.    _Flowering Season_--Almost throughout the year.    _Distribution_--Over nearly all parts of the earth.    From Europe this little low plant found its way, to become the commonest  of our weeds, so completing its march around the globe. At a glance one  knows it to be related to the alyssum and candytuft of our gardens,  albeit a poor relation in spite of its vaunted purses--the tiny,  heart-shaped seed-pods that so rapidly succeed the flowers. What is the  secret of its successful march over the face of the earth? Like the  equally triumphant chickweed, it is easily satisfied with unoccupied  waste land, it avoids the fiercest competition for insect trade by  prolonging its season of bloom far beyond that of any native flower, for  there is not a month in the year when one may not find it even in New  England in sheltered places.      Black Mustard    _Brassica nigra_    _Flowers_--Bright yellow, fading pale, 1/4 to 1/2 in. across, 4-parted,  in elongated racemes; quickly followed by narrow, upright 4-sided pods  about 1/2 in. long appressed against the stem. _Stem:_ Erect, 2 to 7 ft.  tall, branching. _Leaves:_ Variously lobed and divided, finely toothed,  the terminal lobe larger than the 2 to 4 side ones.    _Preferred Habitat_--Roadsides, fields, neglected gardens.    _Flowering Season_--June-November.    _Distribution_--Common throughout our area; naturalized from  Europe and Asia.        \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed,      which a man took and sowed in his field: which indeed is less      than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the      herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come      and lodge in the branches thereof.\"    Commentators differ as to which is the mustard of the parable--this  common Black Mustard, or a rarer shrub-like tree (_Salvadora Persica_),  with an equivalent Arabic name, a pungent odor, and a very small seed.  Inasmuch as the mustard which is systematically planted for fodder by  Old World farmers grows with the greatest luxuriance in Palestine, and  the comparison between the size of its seed and the plant's great height  was already proverbial in the East when Jesus used it, evidence strongly  favors this wayside weed. Indeed, the late Doctor Royle, who endeavored  to prove that it was the shrub that was referred to, finally found that  it does not grow in Galilee.    Now, there are two species which furnish the most powerfully pungent  condiment known to commerce; but the tiny dark brown seeds of the Black  Mustard are sharper than the serpent's tooth, whereas the pale brown  seeds of the White Mustard, often mixed with them, are far more mild.  The latter (_Brassica alba_) is a similar, but more hairy, plant, with  slightly larger yellow flowers. Its pods are constricted like a  necklace between the seeds.    The coarse Hedge Mustard (_Sisymbrium officinale_), with rigid,  spreading branches, and spikes of tiny pale yellow flowers, quickly  followed by awl-shaped pods that are closely appressed to the stem,  abounds in waste places throughout our area. It blooms from May to  November, like the next species.    Another common and most troublesome weed from Europe is the Field or  Corn Mustard, Charlock or Field Kale (_Brassica arvensis_) found in  grain fields, gardens, rich waste lands, and rubbish heaps. The  alternate leaves, which stand boldly out from the stem, are oval,  coarsely saw-toothed, or the lower ones more irregular, and lobed at  their bases, all rough to the touch, and conspicuously veined.          PITCHER-PLANT FAMILY _(Sarracenaceae)_      Pitcher-plant; Side-saddle Flower; Huntsman's Cup; Indian Dipper    _Sarracenea purpurea_    _Flower_--Deep reddish purple, sometimes partly greenish, pink, or red,  2 in. or more across, globose; solitary, nodding from scape 1 to 2 ft.  tall. Calyx of 5 sepals, with 3 or 4 bracts at base; 5 overlapping  petals, enclosing a yellowish, umbrella-shaped dilation of the style,  with 5 rays terminating in 5-hooked stigmas; stamens indefinite.  _Leaves:_ Hollow, pitcher-shaped through the folding together of their  margins, leaving a broad wing; much inflated, hooded, yellowish green  with dark maroon or purple lines and veinings, 4 to 12 in. long, curved,  in a tuft from the root.    _Preferred Habitat_--Peat-bogs; spongy, mossy swamps.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--Labrador to the Rocky Mountains, south to Florida,  Kentucky, and Minnesota.       \"What's this I hear         About the new carnivora?         Can little plants         Eat bugs and ants         And gnats and flies?     A sort of retrograding:         Surely the fare         Of flowers is air         Or sunshine sweet;         They shouldn't eat     Or do aught so degrading!\"    There must always be something shocking in the sacrifice of the higher  life to the lower, of the sensate to what we are pleased to call the  insensate, although no one who has studied the marvellously intelligent  motives that impel a plant's activities can any longer consider the  vegetable creation as lacking sensibility. Science is at length giving  us a glimmering of the meaning of the word universe, teaching, as it  does, that all creatures in sharing the One Life share in many of its  powers, and differ from one another only in degree of possession, not in  kind. The transition from one so-called kingdom into another presumably  higher one is a purely arbitrary line marked by man, and often  impossible to define. The animalcule and the insectivorous plant know no  boundaries between the animal and the vegetable. And who shall say that  the sundew or the bladderwort is not a higher organism than the amoeba?  Animated plants and vegetating animals parallel each other. Several  hundred carnivorous plants in all parts of the world have now been named  by scientists.    It is well worth a journey to some spongy, sphagnum bog to gather clumps  of pitcher-plants which will furnish an interesting study to an entire  household throughout the summer while they pursue their nefarious  business in a shallow bowl on the veranda. A modification of the petiole  forms a deep, hollow pitcher having for its spout a modification of the  blade of the leaf. Usually the pitchers are half filled with water and  tiny drowned victims when we gather them. Some of this fluid must be  rain, but the open pitcher secretes much juice, too. Certain relatives,  whose pitchers have hooded lids that keep out rain, are nevertheless  filled with fluid. On the Pacific Coast the golden jars of _Darlingtonia  californica_, with their overarching hoods, are often so large and  watery as to drown small birds and field mice. Note in passing that  these otherwise dark prisons have translucent spots at the top, whereas  our pitcher-plant is lighted through its open transom.    A sweet secretion within the pitcher's rim, which some say is  intoxicating, others that it is an anesthetic, invites insects to a  fatal feast. It is a simple enough matter for them to walk into the  pitcher over the band of stiff hairs pointing downward like the withes  of a lobster pot, that form an inner covering, or to slip into the well  if they attempt crawling over its polished upper surface. To fly upward  in a perpendicular line, once their wings are wet, is additionally  hopeless, because of the hairs that guard the mouth of the trap; and  so, after vain attempts to fly or crawl out of the prison, they usually  sink exhausted into a watery grave.    When certain plants live in soil that is so poor in nitrogen compounds  that proteid formation is interfered with, they have come to depend more  or less on a carnivorous diet. The sundew actually digests its prey with  the help of a gastric juice similar to what is found in the stomach of  animals; but the bladderwort and pitcher-plants can only absorb in the  form of soup the products of their victims' decay.
