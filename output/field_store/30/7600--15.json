It would seem that had any little devils not been  strained out of his blood by his long line of Huguenot ancestry, they  had followed the fate of the fine-cut, for no one who knew Clifford  van der Veere was ever anxious about the probity of his conduct. He  did not take to the importing business, while his cousins early showed  a natural capacity for the work of the big firm in all its branches.  Clifford's parents, too, seemed to feel that it was time that there be  a professional member of their honorable family. Moreover the property  was large, and the younger sisters would require a guardian, and the  estate an administrator. So Clifford finished the law-course. Nor was  it many years until the family fortune of approximately one million  dollars in real estate, securities and mortgages was left him to  administer for himself and the two sisters. Thus before thirty the  responsibility of these many thousands swept down upon him. Limited in  practical contact with the world, geographically, politically,  socially, having learned little of the play-side of life, he was by  inheritance, training and inclination a conservative. He had never  practiced law. He never tried a case, but he now opened a downtown  office where he punctually arrived at ten o'clock and methodically  spent the morning, carefully, personally managing all the details of  the entailed estate. He was essentially conscientious and, as the  years passed, there was no lessening of interest in his devotion to  each transaction, large or small. There were no losses, though his  conservatism turned him away from many golden opportunities which  knocked at the door of his wealth, the acceptance of which would have  doubled the estate in any ten-year period of these days of New York's  magnificent expansion. He was nearly forty when he married a quiet,  good woman who added little that was new, who most conscientiously  subtracted nothing of the old, from his now systematic life. They both  realized that their Fifth Avenue home was rapidly growing out of date,  so for nearly five years they spent their spare hours daily, in the,  to Clifford, vital and seemingly unending details of modernizing the  old house. It was during those days when the plans so carefully  considered were being realized in granite and marble and polished  woods, that Mrs. van der Veere felt the first distressing touch of  anxiety. Her husband seemed unduly particular. At times he would be  painfully uncertain about minute and minor details of construction and  on a few occasions unprecedentedly failed to get to the office at all,  delayed by protracted discussions of the advisability of certain  changes, long since decided upon, discussions which shook the  confidence of architect and contractor in both his sagacity and  judgment. Fortunately Mrs. van der Veere proved a wholesome counselor  and her opinions often settled details her husband, alone, apparently  could not have decided. At last the great new house was finished; it  was such a home as the van der Veeres should have. Indecision largely  disappeared for three quite normal years, office details only now and  then ruffling the smooth normality of Mr. van der Veere's life. Then  with the early spring nights came an unexplained insomnia. He would  waken at five, four, even three o 'clock, and, unable to get back to  sleep, would read until morning. The doctor found little to excite his  apprehension, but prescribed golf, so three afternoons a week all  summer and fall two hours were reserved for the links. He was better,  still the doctor insisted on three months, that winter, in Southern  California where he could keep up his play. Here he did eighteen holes  a day for weeks at a time, yet some of the nights were haunted by  scruples about neglecting his administrative duties. They returned  home in the spring, and a moderately comfortable year and a half  followed. Then things went wrong rapidly and badly. Peremptorily he  was ordered away from all \"work\" to Southern France, later to Italy  for the winter and to Switzerland for the next summer. And as the Alps  have given of their strength to other needing thousands, so they  ministered to him. He began climbing. His wife thought it was a new  interest. Certainly that was a factor, but he became ambitious and  went wherever he could find guides to take him. He returned home very  rugged the fall he was fifty. Still with reason, Mrs. van der Veere  was anxious, an anxiety shared by the family doctor. Between them they  planned for him a sort of model life, truly a circumscribed life, and  for five years wife and associates protected him from any possible  strain, and for five years it worked successfully. Then in less than a  month, almost like a bolt from the blue, all former symptoms returned,  aggravated in form, bringing most unwelcome new ones in their trail.  The family doctor called in a neurologist who, after examining the  nervous man, spoke seriously of serious possibilities, and advised  serious measures.    Mr. van der Veere was now fifty-five years old, short, almost stocky  in build, dark-skinned, with steel-gray hair and mustache. He was  depressed in mien though always well-bred in bearing. He was not  excitable and outwardly showed little of his suffering. Clifford van  der Veere had always taken life and his duties seriously. For years  his fear of making mistakes had been a chronic source of energy  leakage-now it was a nightmare. All he did cost an exhausting price in  the effort of decision. Duty and fear had long made a battle-ground of  his soul, and when he realized that he had broken down again from  \"overwork,\" as they all expressed it, the depression of melancholy was  added to the weight he so quietly bore. Yet this man of many  responsibilities and interests had never truly worked. Since he left  college he had played at work. Effort had been expended never more  conscientiously. He was ever ready to give added hours of attention to  problems referred to him. His intentions were true, but he did not  know how to work. He did not know how to separate the serious from the  unimportant, and he had never added the leaven of humor to the day's  duties. An unusually well-equipped man, physically and mentally, he  should have found the responsibilities of his administratorship but  play. Had he been living right, he could have multiplied his  efficiency three-fold and been the better for the larger doing. His  wife felt he must \"rest,\" and so did the family doctor; he himself was  practically past arguing or disagreeing.    But the rest-cure which the neurologist prescribed was certainly  unique. It may have been wrongly named. Mr. van der Veere was a man of  unusually strong physique. Nature had equipped him with a muscular  system better than nine-tenths of his fellowmen possess, but he had  never utilized it. For many generations his forbears had wrung food  and life and, unconsciously, health from the soil. He was three  generations from touch with mother earth, and back to the soil he was  sent. He was taught to work increasing hours of common, manual labor.  For weeks he did his part of the necessary drudgery of the world. He  shoveled coal, he spaded in the garden, he worked on the public roads,  he transplanted trees, he hoed common weeds with a common hoe, he  tramped, he toiled and he sweat. The need for physical labor was in  his blood. He needed his share of it, as do we all. And his blood  answered exultantly, as good blood always does, to the call of honest  toil. Within a month he realized a keenness for the work of the day.  His fine muscles took on hardness, they seemed to double in size, and  strength came, and with it not only a willingness but an eagerness  which transformed that strength into productive effort. With the  willingness to do what his hands found to do came sleep, for his  nerves--bred as they had been in good stock--rejoiced when they found  him living as they had for years begged him to live. A fifteen-year-  old appetite came to the fifty-five-year-old man, and transformation  wrought happy changes in his face and bearing. Indecision faded,  introspection disappeared, and a decision came which was to forever  put indecision out of his way. A decision which brought the peace and  contentment to the van der Veere Fifth Avenue home, which religious  intolerance had robbed from the van der Veeres in their stone-thatched  hut in far-away Normandy, a simple decision, not requiring brilliance  nor a college education, nor a professional training, nor even a  loving helpmate to accomplish: \"Six days shall I labor not only with  my brain but with my hands, and the seventh day shall I rest.\"          CHAPTER X    THE FINE ART OF PLAY      It was her earliest recollection, and parts of it were not clear.  There were those big men carrying in her father, and her mother's face  looking so strange, and her father looking so strange with the white  cloths about his head, and the strange faces of doctors and neighbors  she had not seen before. Then the strange stillness and the strange  new fear when her father did not move and they all were so quiet.  These memories were rather blurred; she was not always sure which were  memories of the events or which had grown from what she had afterwards  heard. But of the funeral she was very sure, for she could never  forget those beautiful silvered handles on the shining wooden coffin,  or her resentment toward the women dressed in black who would not let  her touch these--the prettiest things she had ever seen. The colts had  run away, frightened, when an empty sap-barrel fell off the sled, and  her father had been thrown against a tree and brought home with a  fractured skull, to live unconscious two days, and to be buried in the  shiny coffin with the silver handles.    There had been an older child who died as a baby of eight months, and  so Widow Gilmore was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#14)"],[1,"were completely covered with hieroglyphics that      none as yet have been able to read. Wishing that the world might      know the hidden things as fast as they come to light, I was induced      to state the facts, hoping that you would give it an insertion in      your excellent paper; we feel anxious to know the true meaning      of the plates, and publishing the facts might lead to the true      translation.        They were found, I judged, more than twelve feet below the surface      of the top of the mound. I am, most respectfully, a citizen of      Kinderhook.        W. P. HARRIS, M. D.        We the citizens of Kinderhook, whose names are annexed, do certify      and declare that on the 23rd of April, 1843, while excavating a      large mound in this vicinity, Mr. R. Wiley took from said mound six      brass plates of a bell shape, covered with ancient characters. Said      plates were very much oxydated. The bands and rings on said plates      mouldered into dust on a slight pressure.        ROBERT WILEY, GEORGE DECKENSON,        W. LONGNECKER, G. W. F. WARD,        J. R. SHARP, IRA A. CURTIS,        FAYETTE GRUBB, W. P. HARRIS,        W. FUGATE. [4]    Since these plates were sent to Nauvoo for the inspection of the  Prophet Joseph, it will be of interest to know what view he took of  them. The following occurs in his journal under date of Monday, May  1st, 1843:        I insert fac-simile of the six brass plates found near Kinderhook,      in Pike county, Illinois, on April 23, by Mr. R. Wiley and others,      while excavating a large mound. They found a skeleton about six      feet from the surface of the earth, which must have stood nine feet      high. The plates were found on the breast of the skeleton, and were      covered on both sides with ancient characters. I have translated a      portion of them, and find they contain the history of the person      with whom they were found. He was a descendant of Ham, through the      loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom      from the ruler of heaven and earth. [5]    It is proper here to call attention to the fact that the genuineness  of this discovery of the Kinderhook plates is questioned by some  anti-Mormon writers, among them Professor William A. Linn, in his late  work, \"The Story of Mormonism,\" where he says:        But the true story of the Kinderhook plates was disclosed by      an affidavit made by W. Fugate of Mound station, Brown county,      Illinois, before Jay Brown justice of the peace, on June 30,      1879. In this he stated that the plates were a humbug, gotten up      by Robert Wiley, Bridge Whitton, and myself. Whitton (who was a      blacksmith) cut the plates out of some pieces of copper; Wiley      and I made the hieroglyphics by making impressions on beeswax      and filling them with acid, and putting it on the plates. When      they were finished, we put them together with rust made of nitric      acid, old iron and lead, and bound them with a piece of hoop iron,      covering them completely with rust. He describes the burial of the      plates and the digging up, among the spectators of the latter being      two Mormon Elders, Marsh and Sharp. Sharp declared that the Lord      had directed them to witness the digging. The plates were borrowed      and shown to Smith, and were finally given to one Professor      McDowell of St. Louis, for his museum. [6]    Of this presentation of the matter it is only necessary to say that it  is a little singular that Mr. Fugate alone out of the three said to be  in collusion in perpetrating the fraud should disclose it, and that he  should wait from 1843 to 1879--a period of thirty-six years--before  doing so, when he and those said to be associated with him had such an  excellent opportunity to expose the vain pretensions of the Prophet--  if Fugate's tale be true? For while the statement in the text of the  Prophet's Journal to the effect that the find was genuine, and that he  had translated some of the characters and learned certain historical  facts concerning the person with whose remains the plates were found,  may not have been known at the time to the alleged conspirators to  deceive him, still the editor of the _Times and Seasons_--John Taylor,  the close personal friend of the Prophet--took the find seriously, and  expressed at once explicit confidence in an editorial in the _Times and  Seasons_, of May 1st, 1843, that the Prophet could give a translation  of the plates. And this attitude the Church, continued to maintain; for  in _The Prophet_, (a Mormon weekly periodical, published in New York)  of the 15th of February, 1845, there was published a _fac-simile_ of  the Kinderhook plates, together with the _Times and Seasons_ editorial  and all the above matter of the text. How easy to have covered Joseph  Smith and his followers with ridicule by proclaiming the hoax as soon  as they accepted the Kinderhook plates as genuine! Why was it not done?  The fact that Fugate's story was not told until thirty-six years after  the event, and that he alone of all those who were connected with the  event gives that version of it, is rather strong evidence that his  story is the hoax, not the discovery of the plates, nor the engravings  upon them.    III.    _The Tuccabatchey Plates._    In further evidence that the native Americans engraved records on  metallic plates I quote the following from Adair's \"History of the  North American Indians.\" The passage is a footnote on the custom of the  Indians burying a dead person's treasures with him:        In the Tuccabatches on the Tallapoose river, thirty miles above the      Allabahamah garrison are two brazen tables, and five of copper.      They (the Indians) esteem them so sacred as to keep them constantly      in their holy of holies, without touching them in the least, only      in the time of their compounded first-fruit offering, and annual      expiation of sins; at which season, their magus carries one under      his arm, ahead of the people, dancing round in sacred armor; next      to him their head warrior carries another; and those warriors who      choose it carry the rest after the manner of the high priest;      all the other carry white canes with swan-feathers at the top.      Hearing accidentally of these important monuments of antiquity,      and inquiring pretty much about them, I was certified of the      truth of the report by four of the southern traders, at the most      eminent Indian trading house of all English America. One of the      gentlemen informed me, that at my request he endeavored to get the      liberty of viewing the aforesaid tables, but it could not possibly      be obtained, only in the time of the yearly grand sacrifice, for      fear of polluting their holy things, at which time gentlemen of      curiosity may see them. Old Bracket, an Indian, of perhaps one      hundred years old, lives in that old beloved town, who gave the      following description of them:        The shape of the five copper plates: One is a foot and a half long      and seven inches wide, the other four are shorter and narrower.        The shape of the two brass plates was circular, about a foot and a      half in diameter.        He [Bracket] said that he was told by his forefathers that those      plates were given to them by the man we call God; that there had      been many more of other shapes, some as long as he could stretch      with both his arms, and some had writing upon them which are buried      with particular men; and that they had instructions given with      them, viz., they must only be handled by particular people, and      those feasting [fasting?]; and no unclean woman must be suffered to      come near them or the place, where they are deposited. He said none      but his own town's people had any such plates given them, and that      they were a different people from the Creeks. He only remembered      three more which were buried with three of his family and he was      the only man of the family now left. He said, there were two copper      plates under the king's cabin which laid there from the first      settling of the town.        This account was taken in the Tuccabatchey square, 27th July, 1759,      per Will. Bolsover. [7]    The foregoing account of engraven records on gold and copper plates  is important as evidence to the truth of the Book of Mormon only this  far; the Book of Mormon repeatedly declares that such was the manner  of keeping records among the Nephites and the Jaredites, Mormon's  abridgment of the larger Nephite records being engraven in this manner  on plates of gold. And the discoveries related above, all of which were  unknown to Joseph Smith, prove that in ancient America records were so  kept, and constitutes at least important incidental evidence to the  truth of that part of the Book of Mormon statement.

Around it early in  the sixth century B. C., the Jaredites were destroyed. Here, also, a  thousand years later, at the close of the fourth century A. D., the  Nephites met with practical annihilation in a battle which, whether  judged by the importance of the changes it wrought in the affairs of  one of the world's continents, or the number slain, [1] ranks as one"]]]
