The Fairy  then said to Cinderella:    \"Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not  pleased with it?\"    \"Oh! yes,\" cried she; \"but must I go thither as I am, in these nasty  rags?\"    Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same  instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all  beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the  prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her  coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay  till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed  one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice,  her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as  they were before.    She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before  midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for  joy. The King's son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody  knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she  alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the  company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off  dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to  contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was  then heard but a confused noise of:    \"Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!\"    The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and  telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so  beautiful and lovely a creature.    All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress,  that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided  they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.    The King's son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward  took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they  all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof  the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing  on her.    She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand  civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince  had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not  know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the  clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a  courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.    When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having  thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next  day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.    As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the  ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and  opened.    \"How long you have stayed!\" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and  stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she  had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went  from home.    \"If thou hadst been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"thou wouldst  not have been tired with it. There came thither the finest princess, the  most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand  civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"    Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them  the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and  that the King's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all  the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:    \"She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been!  Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow  suit of clothes which you wear every day.\"    \"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte; \"lend my clothes to such a dirty  Cinderwench as thou art! I should be a fool.\"    Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the  refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent  her what she asked for jestingly.    The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella,  but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was always by  her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom  all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her  godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the  clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she  then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but  could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which  the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath,  and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery  but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards  at the palace gate were asked:    If they had not seen a princess go out.    Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly  dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a  gentlewoman.    When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If  they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.    They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck  twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass  slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up;  that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and  that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person  who owned the glass slipper.    What they said was very true; for a few days after the King's son caused  it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose  foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it  upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain;  it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could  to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.  Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them,  laughing:    \"Let me see if it will not fit me.\"    Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman  who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and,  finding her very handsome, said:    It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let  everyone make trial.    He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot,  he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made  of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great,  but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket  the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her  godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella's clothes, made  them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.    And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom  they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg  pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella  took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:    That she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to  love her.    She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought  her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.  Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters  lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two  great lords of the Court.(1)      (1) Charles Perrault.          ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP      There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a  careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in  the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the  father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears and prayers,  Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the  streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the  son of Mustapha the tailor. \"I am, sir,\" replied Aladdin; \"but he died  a long while ago.\" On this the stranger, who was a famous African  magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying, \"I am your uncle, and  knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell  her I am coming.\" Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly  found uncle. \"Indeed, child,\" she said, \"your father had a brother, but  I always thought he was dead.\" However, she prepared supper, and bade  Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently  fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding  Aladdin's mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as  he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin,  and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his  mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would  learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with  merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took  him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at  nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.    The next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long  way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain and the magician  pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them. They then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#14)"],[1,"which Nauvoo  was located, manfully discharged his duties to the Nauvoo portion of  his constituents, by using all his energy to secure them their city  government.    An incident connecting Abraham Lincoln with the passage of this charter  may not be without interest. The State of Illinois was at that time  divided into two political parties, Whigs and Democrats. Both parties  were friendly to the Saints, who considered themselves equally bound  to both parties for acts of kindness. Lincoln was a Whig, and in the  November election his name was on the State electoral ticket as a  Whig candidate for the State legislature. But many of the people of  Nauvoo, wishing to divide their vote, and to show a kindness to the  Democrats, erased the name of Lincoln, and substituted that of Ralston,  a Democrat. It was with no ill feeling, however, towards Mr. Lincoln  that this was done, and when the vote was called on the final passage  of the Nauvoo charter, he had the magnanimity to vote for it; and  congratulated John C. Bennett on his success in securing its enactment.    The Saints rejoiced in the prospects of liberty secured to them by  their city government, and of it Joseph said:        I concocted it for the salvation of The Church, and on principles      so broad, that every honest man might dwell secure under its      protecting influences, without distinction of sect or party.    An inspection of the charter will bear out this opinion of it, for  while it was \"concocted for the salvation of The Church,\" it by  no means secured that salvation by trespassing upon the rights of  others, but by recognizing the rights of the Saints to be equal to  the rights of other citizens. Nor was it intended that Nauvoo should  be an exclusive city for people of the Mormon faith; on the contrary,  all worthy people were invited to come and assist to build it up  and partake of its liberty and anticipated prosperity. An official  proclamation, issued over the signatures of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon  and Hyrum Smith, who then constituted the First Presidency of The  Church, contains the following passage:        We wish it likewise to be distinctly understood, that we claim      no privileges but what we feel cheerfully disposed to share with      our fellow-citizens of every denomination, and every sentiment of      religion; and therefore say, that so far from being restricted to      our own faith, let all those who desire to locate in this place      (Nauvoo) or the vicinity, come, and we will hail them as citizens      and friends, and shall feel it not only a duty, but a privilege to      reciprocate the kindness we have received from the benevolent and      kind-hearted citizens of the State of Illinois.    And as an earnest of the intention, so far as the Saints were  concerned, of carrying out in practice these liberal sentiments and  extending equal rights to people of all religious persuasions, among  the first acts of the city council was the passage of the following  ordinance, introduced by Joseph Smith:        SECTION I. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Nauvoo      that the Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Latter-day      Saints, Quakers, Episcopalians, Universalists, Unitarians,      Mohammedans, and all other religious sects and denominations,      whatever, shall have free toleration and equal privileges in this      city; and should any person be guilty of ridiculing and abusing,      or otherwise deprecating another, in consequence of his religion,      or of disturbing or interrupting any religious meeting within the      limits of this city, he shall, on conviction before the mayor or      municipal court, be considered a disturber of the public peace, and      fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned      not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of said mayor      and court.    The second section made it the duty of all municipal officers to notice  and report any violation of the law--and in fact, of any other law of  the city--to the mayor; and the municipal officers were authorized  to arrest all violators of this law, either with or without process;  so that the fullest religious liberty was secured to all sects, and  all religions, and to people of no religion at all if any such there  should be. Under such an ordinance, people could worship Almighty  God according to the dictates of their consciences, without fear of  molestation from any one; but they were restrained from interfering  with the religion or mode of worship of their fellows--they were told,  in a manner, that their liberties ended where those of other people  commenced.    On the first of February, 1841, the first election for members of the  city council took place, as provided by the city charter. John C.  Bennett was chosen mayor; William Marks, Samuel H. Smith, D. H. Wells,  and N. K. Whitney, aldermen; Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon,  Chas. C. Rich, John T. Barnett, Wilson Law, Don C. Smith, J. P. Greene  and Vinson Knight, councilors. On the third of the month the city  council was organized, by appointing the following officers: marshal,  H. G. Sherwood; recorder, James Sloan; treasurer, R. B. Thompson;  assessor, James Robinson; supervisor of streets, Austin Cowles.    Mayor Bennett, the same day, delivered his inaugural address.  After making several recommendations to the council relative to  the establishment of an educational institution, a militia, the  enactment of a temperance ordinance, and other measures affecting  the manufacturing and commercial interests of the city; and further  recommending that the protecting aegis of the corporation be thrown  around every moral and religious institution of the day, which was  in any way calculated to ennoble or ameliorate the condition of the  citizens, he concluded his speech in these words:        As the chief magistrate of your city, I am determined to execute      all State laws, and city ordinances passed in pursuance of law, to      the very letter, should it require the strong arm of military power      to enable me to do so. As an officer, I know no man; the peaceful,      unoffending citizen shall be protected in the full exercise of all      his civil, political and religious rights, and the guilty violator      of the law shall be punished without respect to persons.    The first act of the city council, after its organization, was to  express its gratitude for its privileges and powers conferred upon the  city by its charter. For this purpose the following resolution was  introduced by Joseph Smith, and adopted:        _Resolved_, by the city council of the city of Nauvoo, that the      unfeigned thanks of this community be respectfully tendered to the      governor, council of revision, and legislature of the State of      Illinois, as a feeble testimonial of their respect and esteem of      noble, high-minded, and patriotic statesmen; and as an evidence of      gratitude for the signal powers recently conferred--and that the      citizens of Quincy be held in everlasting remembrance for their      unparalleled liberality and marked kindness to our people, when in      their greatest state of suffering and want.    The next move was to pass a temperance ordinance, which practically  made Nauvoo a prohibition city--that is, so far as prohibitory  ordinances prohibit.        CHAPTER XV.    THE NAUVOO LEGION.    THE Nauvoo charter proper really contained two other charters, viz: One  for the establishment of a university within the limits of the city  \"for the teaching of the arts and sciences, and learned professions,\"  and another for the organization of an independent military body to be  called the \"Nauvoo Legion.\"    An ordinance was passed on the third of February, in relation to the  university, appointing a chancellor and board of regents. A site for a  building was selected, and plans of the structure were drawn, but that  was as far as the matter went, as the city had no funds with which to  proceed with the work of construction.    An ordinance was also passed on the above date authorizing the  organization of the Nauvoo Legion. The original provision in the Nauvoo  charter establishing this military body provided that the city council  might organize the inhabitants of the city, subject to military duty  under the laws of the State, into an independent body of militia; and a  subsequent amendment to the charter extended the privilege of joining  the Legion to any citizen of Hancock County, who might by voluntary  enrollment desire to do so; and in that event he was to have all the  privileges to be enjoyed by members of that organization. The charter  provided that the officers of the Legion should be commissioned by the  governor; and that the members thereof be required to perform the same  amount of military duty as the regular militia of the State; they were  to be at the disposal of the mayor in executing the laws and ordinances  of the city, and the laws of the State; and also at the disposal of  the governor for the public defense, and the execution of the laws  of the State and of the United States; and were entitled to their  proportion of the public arms; but were exempt from all military duty  not specified in these provisions.    The commissioned officers of the Legion were constituted its  court-martial, which was its law-making department; but no law  inconsistent with either the Constitution of the United States or  the State of Illinois was to be enacted by this court. The privilege  of organizing the citizens of Nauvoo, and as many of the citizens of  Hancock County as might desire to unite with them, into an independent  military body, was highly gratifying to the people of Nauvoo, but  more especially so to Joseph Smith, who, in speaking of it, in a  proclamation to the Saints scattered abroad, said:        The Nauvoo Legion embraces all our military"]]]
