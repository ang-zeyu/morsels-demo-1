Neither do they swear such fealty to their mistress Antiquity,  that they openly, and in sight of all, deny and desert their  friend Truth. But even as they see that the credulous and vain  are disposed at the first blush to accept and believe everything  that is proposed to them, so do they observe that the dull and  unintellectual are indisposed to see what lies before their eyes,  and even deny the light of the noonday sun. They teach us in our  course of philosophy to sedulously avoid the fables of the poets  and the fancies of the vulgar, as the false conclusions of the  sceptics. And then the studious and good and true, never suffer  their minds to be warped by the passions of hatred and envy,  which unfit men duly to weigh the arguments that are advanced in  behalf of truth, or to appreciate the proposition that is even  fairly demonstrated. Neither do they think it unworthy of them to  change their opinion if truth and undoubted demonstration require  them to do so. They do not esteem it discreditable to desert  error, though sanctioned by the highest antiquity, for they know  full well that to err, to be deceived, is human; that many things  are discovered by accident and that many may be learned  indifferently from any quarter, by an old man from a youth, by a  person of understanding from one of inferior capacity.    My dear colleagues, I had no purpose to swell this treatise into  a large volume by quoting the names and writings of anatomists,  or to make a parade of the strength of my memory, the extent of  my reading, and the amount of my pains; because I profess both to  learn and to teach anatomy, not from books but from dissections;  not from the positions of philosophers but from the fabric of  nature; and then because I do not think it right or proper to  strive to take from the ancients any honor that is their due, nor  yet to dispute with the moderns, and enter into controversy with  those who have excelled in anatomy and been my teachers. I would  not charge with wilful falsehood any one who was sincerely  anxious for truth, nor lay it to any one's door as a crime that  he had fallen into error. I avow myself the partisan of truth  alone; and I can indeed say that I have used all my endeavours,  bestowed all my pains on an attempt to produce something that  should be agreeable to the good, profitable to the learned, and  useful to letters.    Farewell, most worthy Doctors, And think kindly of your  Anatomist,    WILLIAM HARVEY.          INTRODUCTION      As we are about to discuss the motion, action, and use of the  heart and arteries, it is imperative on us first to state what  has been thought of these things by others in their writings, and  what has been held by the vulgar and by tradition, in order that  what is true may be confirmed, and what is false set right by  dissection, multiplied experience, and accurate observation.    Almost all anatomists, physicians, and philosophers up to the  present time have supposed, with Galen, that the object of the  pulse was the same as that of respiration, and only differed in  one particular, this being conceived to depend on the animal, the  respiration on the vital faculty; the two, in all other respects,  whether with reference to purpose or to motion, comporting  themselves alike. Whence it is affirmed, as by Hieronymus  Fabricius of Aquapendente, in his book on \"Respiration,\" which  has lately appeared, that as the pulsation of the heart and  arteries does not suffice for the ventilation and refrigeration  of the blood, therefore were the lungs fashioned to surround the  heart. From this it appears that whatever has hitherto been said  upon the systole and diastole, or on the motion of the heart and  arteries, has been said with especial reference to the lungs.    But as the structure and movements of the heart differ from those  of the lungs, and the motions of the arteries from those of the  chest, so it seems likely that other ends and offices will thence  arise, and that the pulsations and uses of the heart, likewise of  the arteries, will differ in many respects from the heavings and  uses of the chest and lungs. For did the arterial pulse and the  respiration serve the same ends; did the arteries in their  diastole take air into their cavities, as commonly stated, and in  their systole emit fuliginous vapours by the same pores of the  flesh and skin; and further, did they, in the time intermediate  between the diastole and the systole, contain air, and at all  times either air or spirits, or fuliginous vapours, what should  then be said to Galen, who wrote a book on purpose to show that  by nature the arteries contained blood, and nothing but blood,  and consequently neither spirits nor air, as may readily be  gathered from the experiments and reasonings contained in the  same book? Now, if the arteries are filled in the diastole with  air then taken into them (a larger quantity of air penetrating  when the pulse is large and full), it must come to pass that if  you plunge into a bath of water or of oil when the pulse is  strong and full, it ought forthwith to become either smaller or  much slower, since the circumambient bath will render it either  difficult or impossible for the air to penetrate. In like manner,  as all the arteries, those that are deep-seated as well as those  that are superficial, are dilated at the same instant and with  the same rapidity, how is it possible that air should penetrate  to the deeper parts as freely and quickly through the skin,  flesh, and other structures, as through the cuticle alone? And  how should the arteries of the foetus draw air into their  cavities through the abdomen of the mother and the body of the  womb? And how should seals, whales, dolphins, and other  cetaceans, and fishes of every description, living in the depths  of the sea, take in and emit air by the diastole and systole of  their arteries through the infinite mass of water? For to say  that they absorb the air that is present in the water, and emit  their fumes into this medium, were to utter something like a  figment. And if the arteries in their systole expel fuliginous  vapours from their cavities through the pores of the flesh and  skin, why not the spirits, which are said to be contained in  those vessels, at the same time, since spirits are much more  subtile than fuliginous vapours or smoke? And if the arteries  take in and cast out air in the systole and diastole, like the  lungs in the process of respiration, why do they not do the same  thing when a wound is made in one of them, as in the operation of  arteriotomy? When the windpipe is divided, it is sufficiently  obvious that the air enters and returns through the wound by two  opposite movements; but when an artery is divided, it is equally  manifest that blood escapes in one continuous stream, and that no  air either enters or issues. If the pulsations of the arteries  fan and refrigerate the several parts of the body as the lungs do  the heart, how comes it, as is commonly said, that the arteries  carry the vital blood into the different parts, abundantly  charged with vital spirits, which cherish the heat of these  parts, sustain them when asleep, and recruit them when exhausted?  How should it happen that, if you tie the arteries, immediately  the parts not only become torpid, and frigid, and look pale, but  at length cease even to be nourished? This, according to Galen,  is because they are deprived of the heat which flowed through all  parts from the heart, as its source; whence it would appear that  the arteries rather carry warmth to the parts than serve for any  fanning or refrigeration. Besides, how can their diastole draw  spirits from the heart to warm the body and its parts, and means  of cooling them from without? Still further, although some affirm  that the lungs, arteries, and heart have all the same offices,  they yet maintain that the heart is the workshop of the spirits,  and that the arteries contain and transmit them; denying,  however, in opposition to the opinion of Columbus, that the lungs  can either make or contain spirits. They then assert, with Galen,  against Erasistratus, that it is the blood, not spirits, which is  contained in the arteries.    These opinions are seen to be so incongruous and mutually  subversive, that every one of them is justly brought under  suspicion. That it is blood and blood alone which is contained in  the arteries is made manifest by the experiment of Galen, by  arteriotomy, and by wounds; for from a single divided artery, as  Galen himself affirms in more than one place, the whole of the  blood may be withdrawn in the course of half an hour or less. The  experiment of Galen alluded to is this: \"If you include a portion  of an artery between two ligatures, and slit it open lengthwise  you will find nothing but blood\"; and thus he proves that the  arteries contain only blood. And we too may be permitted to  proceed by a like train of reasoning: if we find the same blood  in the arteries as in the veins, after having tied them in the  same way, as I have myself repeatedly ascertained, both in the  dead body and in living animals, we may fairly conclude that the  arteries contain the same blood as the veins, and nothing but the  same blood. Some, whilst they attempt to lessen the difficulty,  affirm that the blood is spirituous and arterious, and virtually  concede that the office of the arteries is to carry blood from  the heart into the whole of the body, and that they are therefore  filled with blood; for spirituous blood is not the less blood on  that account. And no one denies the blood as such, even the  portion of it which flows in the veins, is imbued with spirits.  But if that portion of it which is contained in the arteries be  richer in spirits, it is still to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#14)"],[1," I am going to wait for nothing.\"    Indeed, he paced up and down the room like a wild beast caged, while  call after call was sent to neighbouring cab ranks, for a long time  without result. What did it mean, his wife's failure to answer the  telephone? It might mean that neither she nor their one servant nor Dan  was in the house. And if they were not in the house at this hour of the  night, where could they possibly be? This it might mean, or--something  worse.    A thousand and one possibilities, hideous, fantastic, appalling, flashed  through his mind. He was beginning to learn what Zani Chada had meant  when he had said: \"I have followed your career with interest.\"    At last a taxi was found, and the man instructed over the 'phone to  proceed immediately to Limehouse station. He seemed so long in coming  that when at last the cab was heard to pause outside, Kerry could not  trust himself to speak to the driver, but directed a sergeant to give  him the address. He entered silently and closed the door.    A steady drizzle of rain was falling. It had already dispersed the fog,  so that he might hope with luck to be home within the hour. As a matter  of fact, the man performed the journey in excellent time, but it seemed  to his passenger that he could have walked quicker, such was the gnawing  anxiety within him and the fear which prompted him to long for wings.    Instructing the cabman to wait, Kerry unlocked the front door and  entered. He had noted a light in the dining room window, and entering,  he found his wife awaiting him there. She rose as he entered, with  horror in her comely face.    \"Dan!\" she whispered. \"Dan! where is ye'r mackintosh?\"    \"I didn't take it,\" he replied, endeavouring to tell himself that his  apprehensions had been groundless. \"But how was it that you did not  answer the telephone?\"    \"What do ye mean, Dan?\" Mary Kerry stared, her eyes growing wider and  wider. \"The boy answered, Dan. He set out wi' ye'r mackintosh full an  hour and a half since.\"    \"What!\"    The truth leaped out at Kerry like an enemy out of ambush.    \"Who sent that message?\"    \"Someone frae the Yard, to tell the boy to bring ye'r mackintosh alone  at once. Dan! Dan------\"    She advanced, hands outstretched, quivering, but Kerry had leaped out  into the narrow hallway. He raised the telephone receiver, listened for  a moment, and then jerked it back upon the hook.    \"Dead line!\" he muttered. \"Someone has been at work with a wire-cutter  outside the house!\"    His wife came out to where he stood, and, clenching his teeth very  grimly, he took her in his arms. She was shaking as if palsied.    \"Mary dear,\" he said, \"pray with all your might that I am given strength  to do my duty.\"    She looked at him with haggard, tearless eyes.    \"Tell me the truth: ha' they got my boy?\"    His fingers tightened on her shoulders.    \"Don't worry,\" he said, \"and don't ask me to stay to explain. When I  come back I'll have Dan with me!\"    He trusted himself no further, but, clapping his hat on his head, walked  out to the waiting cab.    \"Back to Limehouse police station,\" he directed rapidly.    \"Lor lumme!\" muttered the taximan. \"Where are you goin' to after that,  guv'nor? It's a bit off the map.\"    \"I'm going to hell!\" rapped Kerry, suddenly thrusting his red face very  near to that of the speaker. \"And you're going to drive me!\"          VI    THE KNIGHT ERRANT        Recognizing the superior strength of his captors, young Kerry soon gave  up struggling. The thrill of his first real adventure entered into his  blood. He remembered that he was the son of his father, and he realized,  being a quick-witted lad, that he was in the grip of enemies of his  father. The panic which had threatened him when first he had recognized  that he was in the hands of Chinese, gave place to a cold rage--a  heritage which in later years was to make him a dangerous man.    He lay quite passively in the grasp of someone who held him fast, and  learned, by breathing quietly, that the presence of the muffler about  his nose and mouth did not greatly inconvenience him. There was some  desultory conversation between the two men in the car, but it  was carried on in an odd, sibilant language which the boy did not  understand, but which he divined to be Chinese. He thought how every  other boy in the school would envy him, and the thought was stimulating,  nerving. On the very first day of his holidays he was become the central  figure of a Chinatown drama.    The last traces of fear fled. His position was uncomfortable and his  limbs were cramped, but he resigned himself, with something almost like  gladness, and began to look forward to that which lay ahead with a zest  and a will to be no passive instrument which might have surprised his  captors could they have read the mind of their captive.    The journey seemed almost interminable, but young Kerry suffered it in  stoical silence until the car stopped and he was lifted and carried down  stone steps into some damp, earthy-smelling place. Some distance was  traversed, and then many flights of stairs were mounted, some bare but  others carpeted.    Finally he was deposited in a chair, and as he raised his hand to the  scarf, which toward the end of the journey had been bound more tightly  about his head so as to prevent him from seeing at all, he heard a door  closed and locked.    The scarf was quickly removed. And Dan found himself in a low-ceilinged  attic having a sloping roof and one shuttered window. A shadeless  electric lamp hung from the ceiling. Excepting the cane-seated chair in  which he had been deposited and a certain amount of nondescript lumber,  the attic was unfurnished. Dan rapidly considered what his father would  have done in the circumstances.    \"Make sure that the door is locked,\" he muttered.    He tried it, and it was locked beyond any shadow of doubt.    \"The window.\"    Shutters covered it, and these were fastened with a padlock.    He considered this padlock attentively; then, drawing from his pocket  one of those wonderful knives which are really miniature tool-chests, he  raised from a grove the screw-driver which formed part of its equipment,  and with neatness and dispatch unscrewed the staple to which the padlock  was attached!    A moment later he had opened the shutters and was looking out into the  drizzle of the night.    The room in which he was confined was on the third floor of a dingy,  brick-built house; a portion of some other building faced him; down  below was a stone-paved courtyard. To the left stood a high wall, and  beyond it he obtained a glimpse of other dingy buildings. One lighted  window was visible--a square window in the opposite building, from which  amber light shone out.    Somewhere in the street beyond was a standard lamp. He could detect the  halo which it cast into the misty rain. The glass was very dirty, and  young Kerry raised the sash, admitting a draught of damp, cold air into  the room. He craned out, looking about him eagerly.    A rainwater-pipe was within reach of his hand on the right of the window  and, leaning out still farther, young Kerry saw that it passed beside  two other, larger, windows on the floor beneath him. Neither of these  showed any light.    Dizzy heights have no terror for healthy youth. The brackets supporting  the rain-pipe were a sufficient staircase for the agile Dan, a more  slippery prisoner than the famous Baron Trenck; and, discarding his  muffler and his Burberry, he climbed out upon the sill and felt with his  thick-soled boots for the first of these footholds. Clutching the ledge,  he lowered himself and felt for the next.    Then came the moment when he must trust all his weight to the pipe.  Clenching his teeth, he risked it, felt for and found the third angle,  and then, still clutching the pipe, stood for a moment upon the ledge  of the window immediately beneath him. He was curious respecting the  lighted window of the neighbouring house; and, twisting about, he bent,  peering across--and saw a sight which arrested his progress.    The room within was furnished in a way which made him gasp with  astonishment. It was like an Eastern picture, he thought. Her golden  hair dishevelled and her hands alternately clenching and unclenching,  a woman whom he considered to be most wonderfully dressed was pacing  wildly up and down, a look of such horror upon her pale face that Dan's  heart seemed to stop beating for a moment!    Here was real trouble of a sort which appealed to all the chivalry  in the boy's nature. He considered the window, which was glazed with  amber-coloured glass, observed that it was sufficiently open to enable  him to slip the fastening and open it entirely could he but reach it.  And--yes!--there was a rain-pipe!    Climbing down to the yard, he looked quickly about him, ran across, and  climbed up to the lighted window. A moment later he had pushed it widely  open.    He was greeted by a stifled cry, but, cautiously transferring his weight  from the friendly pipe to the ledge, he got astride of it, one foot in  the room. Then, by exercise of a monkey-like agility, he wriggled his  head and shoulders within.    \"It's all right,\" he said softly and reassuringly; \"I'm Dan Kerry, son  of Chief Inspector Kerry. Can I be of any assistance?\"    Her hands clasped convulsively together, the woman stood looking up at  him.    \"Oh, thank God!\" said the captive. \"But what are you going to do? Can  you get me out?\"    \"Don't worry,\" replied Dan confidently. \"Father and I can manage it all  right!\"    He performed a singular contortion, as a result of which his other leg  and foot appeared inside the window. Then, twisting around, he lowered  himself and dropped triumphantly upon a cushioned divan. At that moment  he would have faced a cage full of man-eating tigers. The spirit of  adventure had him in its grip. He stood up, breathing rapidly, his crop  of red hair more"]]]
