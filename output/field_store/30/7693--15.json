I scraped and  rubbed until I was tired, and finally picked up my brushes and hurled  them through the canvas with a forcible expression, the tone alone of  which reached Tessie's ears.    Nevertheless she promptly began: \"That's it! Swear and act silly and ruin  your brushes! You have been three weeks on that study, and now look!  What's the good of ripping the canvas? What creatures artists are!\"    I felt about as much ashamed as I usually did after such an outbreak, and  I turned the ruined canvas to the wall. Tessie helped me clean my  brushes, and then danced away to dress. From the screen she regaled me  with bits of advice concerning whole or partial loss of temper, until,  thinking, perhaps, I had been tormented sufficiently, she came out to  implore me to button her waist where she could not reach it on the  shoulder.    \"Everything went wrong from the time you came back from the window and  talked about that horrid-looking man you saw in the churchyard,\" she  announced.    \"Yes, he probably bewitched the picture,\" I said, yawning. I looked at my  watch.    \"It's after six, I know,\" said Tessie, adjusting her hat before the  mirror.    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"I didn't mean to keep you so long.\" I leaned out of  the window but recoiled with disgust, for the young man with the pasty  face stood below in the churchyard. Tessie saw my gesture of disapproval  and leaned from the window.    \"Is that the man you don't like?\" she whispered.    I nodded.    \"I can't see his face, but he does look fat and soft. Someway or other,\"  she continued, turning to look at me, \"he reminds me of a dream,--an  awful dream I once had. Or,\" she mused, looking down at her shapely  shoes, \"was it a dream after all?\"    \"How should I know?\" I smiled.    Tessie smiled in reply.    \"You were in it,\" she said, \"so perhaps you might know something about  it.\"    \"Tessie! Tessie!\" I protested, \"don't you dare flatter by saying that you  dream about me!\"    \"But I did,\" she insisted; \"shall I tell you about it?\"    \"Go ahead,\" I replied, lighting a cigarette.    Tessie leaned back on the open window-sill and began very seriously.    \"One night last winter I was lying in bed thinking about nothing at all  in particular. I had been posing for you and I was tired out, yet it  seemed impossible for me to sleep. I heard the bells in the city ring  ten, eleven, and midnight. I must have fallen asleep about midnight  because I don't remember hearing the bells after that. It seemed to me  that I had scarcely closed my eyes when I dreamed that something impelled  me to go to the window. I rose, and raising the sash leaned out.  Twenty-fifth Street was deserted as far as I could see. I began to be  afraid; everything outside seemed so--so black and uncomfortable. Then  the sound of wheels in the distance came to my ears, and it seemed to me  as though that was what I must wait for. Very slowly the wheels  approached, and, finally, I could make out a vehicle moving along the  street. It came nearer and nearer, and when it passed beneath my window I  saw it was a hearse. Then, as I trembled with fear, the driver turned and  looked straight at me. When I awoke I was standing by the open window  shivering with cold, but the black-plumed hearse and the driver were  gone. I dreamed this dream again in March last, and again awoke beside  the open window. Last night the dream came again. You remember how it was  raining; when I awoke, standing at the open window, my night-dress was  soaked.\"    \"But where did I come into the dream?\" I asked.    \"You--you were in the coffin; but you were not dead.\"    \"In the coffin?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How did you know? Could you see me?\"    \"No; I only knew you were there.\"    \"Had you been eating Welsh rarebits, or lobster salad?\" I began,  laughing, but the girl interrupted me with a frightened cry.    \"Hello! What's up?\" I said, as she shrank into the embrasure by the  window.    \"The--the man below in the churchyard;--he drove the hearse.\"    \"Nonsense,\" I said, but Tessie's eyes were wide with terror. I went to  the window and looked out. The man was gone. \"Come, Tessie,\" I urged,  \"don't be foolish. You have posed too long; you are nervous.\"    \"Do you think I could forget that face?\" she murmured. \"Three times I saw  the hearse pass below my window, and every time the driver turned and  looked up at me. Oh, his face was so white and--and soft? It looked  dead--it looked as if it had been dead a long time.\"    I induced the girl to sit down and swallow a glass of Marsala. Then I sat  down beside her, and tried to give her some advice.    \"Look here, Tessie,\" I said, \"you go to the country for a week or two,  and you'll have no more dreams about hearses. You pose all day, and when  night comes your nerves are upset. You can't keep this up. Then again,  instead of going to bed when your day's work is done, you run off to  picnics at Sulzer's Park, or go to the Eldorado or Coney Island, and when  you come down here next morning you are fagged out. There was no real  hearse. There was a soft-shell crab dream.\"    She smiled faintly.    \"What about the man in the churchyard?\"    \"Oh, he's only an ordinary unhealthy, everyday creature.\"    \"As true as my name is Tessie Reardon, I swear to you, Mr. Scott, that  the face of the man below in the churchyard is the face of the man who  drove the hearse!\"    \"What of it?\" I said. \"It's an honest trade.\"    \"Then you think I _did_ see the hearse?\"    \"Oh,\" I said diplomatically, \"if you really did, it might not be unlikely  that the man below drove it. There is nothing in that.\"    Tessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum  from a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth. Then drawing on her  gloves she offered me her hand, with a frank, \"Good-night, Mr. Scott,\"  and walked out.          II    The next morning, Thomas, the bell-boy, brought me the _Herald_ and  a bit of news. The church next door had been sold. I thanked Heaven for  it, not that being a Catholic I had any repugnance for the congregation  next door, but because my nerves were shattered by a blatant exhorter,  whose every word echoed through the aisle of the church as if it had been  my own rooms, and who insisted on his r's with a nasal persistence which  revolted my every instinct. Then, too, there was a fiend in human shape,  an organist, who reeled off some of the grand old hymns with an  interpretation of his own, and I longed for the blood of a creature who  could play the doxology with an amendment of minor chords which one hears  only in a quartet of very young undergraduates. I believe the minister  was a good man, but when he bellowed: \"And the Lorrrrd said unto Moses,  the Lorrrd is a man of war; the Lorrrd is his name. My wrath shall wax  hot and I will kill you with the sworrrrd!\" I wondered how many centuries  of purgatory it would take to atone for such a sin.    \"Who bought the property?\" I asked Thomas.    \"Nobody that I knows, sir. They do say the gent wot owns this 'ere  'Amilton flats was lookin' at it. 'E might be a bildin' more studios.\"    I walked to the window. The young man with the unhealthy face stood by  the churchyard gate, and at the mere sight of him the same overwhelming  repugnance took possession of me.    \"By the way, Thomas,\" I said, \"who is that fellow down there?\"    Thomas sniffed. \"That there worm, sir? 'Es night-watchman of the church,  sir. 'E maikes me tired a-sittin' out all night on them steps and lookin'  at you insultin' like. I'd a punched 'is 'ed, sir--beg pardon, sir--\"    \"Go on, Thomas.\"    \"One night a comin' 'ome with Arry, the other English boy, I sees 'im a  sittin' there on them steps. We 'ad Molly and Jen with us, sir, the two  girls on the tray service, an' 'e looks so insultin' at us that I up and  sez: 'Wat you looking hat, you fat slug?'--beg pardon, sir, but that's  'ow I sez, sir. Then 'e don't say nothin' and I sez: 'Come out and I'll  punch that puddin' 'ed.' Then I hopens the gate an' goes in, but 'e don't  say nothin', only looks insultin' like. Then I 'its 'im one, but, ugh!  'is 'ed was that cold and mushy it ud sicken you to touch 'im.\"    \"What did he do then?\" I asked curiously.    \"'Im? Nawthin'.\"    \"And you, Thomas?\"    The young fellow flushed with embarrassment and smiled uneasily.    \"Mr. Scott, sir, I ain't no coward, an' I can't make it out at all why I  run. I was in the 5th Lawncers, sir, bugler at Tel-el-Kebir, an' was shot  by the wells.\"    \"You don't mean to say you ran away?\"    \"Yes, sir; I run.\"    \"Why?\"    \"That's just what I want to know, sir. I grabbed Molly an' run, an' the  rest was as frightened as I.\"    \"But what were they frightened at?\"    Thomas refused to answer for a while, but now my curiosity was aroused  about the repulsive young man below and I pressed him. Three years'  sojourn in America had not only modified Thomas' cockney dialect but had  given him the American's fear of ridicule.    \"You won't believe me, Mr. Scott, sir?\"    \"Yes, I will.\"    \"You will lawf at me, sir?\"    \"Nonsense!\"    He hesitated. \"Well, sir, it's Gawd's truth that when I 'it 'im 'e  grabbed me wrists, sir, and when I twisted 'is soft, mushy fist one of  'is fingers come off in me 'and.\"    The utter loathing and horror of Thomas' face must have been reflected in  my own, for he added:    \"It's orful, an' now when I see 'im I just go away. 'E maikes me hill.\"    When Thomas had gone I went to the window. The man stood beside the  church-railing with both hands on the gate, but I hastily retreated to my  easel again, sickened and horrified, for I saw that the middle finger of  his right hand was missing.    At nine o'clock Tessie appeared and vanished behind the screen with a  merry \"Good morning, Mr. Scott.\" When she had reappeared and taken her  pose upon the model-stand I started a new canvas, much to her delight.  She"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#14)"],[1,"rse, see; but that to the mind of the  panther this would carry any suggestion of harm in so far as his master  was concerned, Tarzan could not guess.    What had brought the beast to him?  The fact that he had come augured  well for what he might accomplish; but when Tarzan tried to get Sheeta  to gnaw his bonds asunder the great animal could not seem to understand  what was expected of him, and, instead, but licked the wrists and arms  of the prisoner.    Presently there came an interruption.  Some one was approaching the  hut.  Sheeta gave a low growl and slunk into the blackness of a far  corner.  Evidently the visitor did not hear the warning sound, for  almost immediately he entered the hut--a tall, naked, savage warrior.    He came to Tarzan's side and pricked him with a spear.   From the lips  of the ape-man came a weird, uncanny sound, and in answer to it there  leaped from the blackness of the hut's farthermost corner a bolt of  fur-clad death.  Full upon the breast of the painted savage the great  beast struck, burying sharp talons in the black flesh and sinking great  yellow fangs in the ebon throat.    There was a fearful scream of anguish and terror from the black, and  mingled with it was the hideous challenge of the killing panther.  Then  came silence--silence except for the rending of bloody flesh and the  crunching of human bones between mighty jaws.    The noise had brought sudden quiet to the village without.   Then there  came the sound of voices in consultation.    High-pitched, fear-filled voices, and deep, low tones of authority, as  the chief spoke.  Tarzan and the panther heard the approaching  footsteps of many men, and then, to Tarzan's surprise, the great cat  rose from across the body of its kill, and slunk noiselessly from the  hut through the aperture through which it had entered.    The man heard the soft scraping of the body as it passed over the top  of the palisade, and then silence.  From the opposite side of the hut  he heard the savages approaching to investigate.    He had little hope that Sheeta would return, for had the great cat  intended to defend him against all comers it would have remained by his  side as it heard the approaching savages without.    Tarzan knew how strange were the workings of the brains of the mighty  carnivora of the jungle--how fiendishly fearless they might be in the  face of certain death, and again how timid upon the slightest  provocation.  There was doubt in his mind that some note of the  approaching blacks vibrating with fear had struck an answering chord in  the nervous system of the panther, sending him slinking through the  jungle, his tail between his legs.    The man shrugged.  Well, what of it?  He had expected to die, and,  after all, what might Sheeta have done for him other than to maul a  couple of his enemies before a rifle in the hands of one of the whites  should have dispatched him!    If the cat could have released him!  Ah! that would have resulted in a  very different story; but it had proved beyond the understanding of  Sheeta, and now the beast was gone and Tarzan must definitely abandon  hope.    The natives were at the entrance to the hut now, peering fearfully into  the dark interior.  Two in advance held lighted torches in their left  hands and ready spears in their right.   They held back timorously  against those behind, who were pushing them forward.    The shrieks of the panther's victim, mingled with those of the great  cat, had wrought mightily upon their poor nerves, and now the awful  silence of the dark interior seemed even more terribly ominous than had  the frightful screaming.    Presently one of those who was being forced unwillingly within hit upon  a happy scheme for learning first the precise nature of the danger  which menaced him from the silent interior.   With a quick movement he  flung his lighted torch into the centre of the hut.  Instantly all  within was illuminated for a brief second before the burning brand was  dashed out against the earth floor.    There was the figure of the white prisoner still securely bound as they  had last seen him, and in the centre of the hut another figure equally  as motionless, its throat and breasts horribly torn and mangled.    The sight that met the eyes of the foremost savages inspired more  terror within their superstitious breasts than would the presence of  Sheeta, for they saw only the result of a ferocious attack upon one of  their fellows.    Not seeing the cause, their fear-ridden minds were free to attribute  the ghastly work to supernatural causes, and with the thought they  turned, screaming, from the hut, bowling over those who stood directly  behind them in the exuberance of their terror.    For an hour Tarzan heard only the murmur of excited voices from the far  end of the village.  Evidently the savages were once more attempting to  work up their flickering courage to a point that would permit them to  make another invasion of the hut, for now and then came a savage yell,  such as the warriors give to bolster up their bravery upon the field of  battle.    But in the end it was two of the whites who first entered, carrying  torches and guns.  Tarzan was not surprised to discover that neither of  them was Rokoff.  He would have wagered his soul that no power on earth  could have tempted that great coward to face the unknown menace of the  hut.    When the natives saw that the white men were not attacked they, too,  crowded into the interior, their voices hushed with terror as they  looked upon the mutilated corpse of their comrade.   The whites tried  in vain to elicit an explanation from Tarzan; but to all their queries  he but shook his head, a grim and knowing smile curving his lips.    At last Rokoff came.    His face grew very white as his eyes rested upon the bloody thing  grinning up at him from the floor, the face set in a death mask of  excruciating horror.    \"Come!\" he said to the chief.  \"Let us get to work and finish this  demon before he has an opportunity to repeat this thing upon more of  your people.\"    The chief gave orders that Tarzan should be lifted and carried to the  stake; but it was several minutes before he could prevail upon any of  his men to touch the prisoner.    At last, however, four of the younger warriors dragged Tarzan roughly  from the hut, and once outside the pall of terror seemed lifted from  the savage hearts.    A score of howling blacks pushed and buffeted the prisoner down the  village street and bound him to the post in the centre of the circle of  little fires and boiling cooking-pots.    When at last he was made fast and seemed quite helpless and beyond the  faintest hope of succour, Rokoff's shrivelled wart of courage swelled  to its usual proportions when danger was not present.    He stepped close to the ape-man, and, seizing a spear from the hands of  one of the savages, was the first to prod the helpless victim.  A  little stream of blood trickled down the giant's smooth skin from the  wound in his side; but no murmur of pain passed his lips.    The smile of contempt upon his face seemed to infuriate the Russian.  With a volley of oaths he leaped at the helpless captive, beating him  upon the face with his clenched fists and kicking him mercilessly about  the legs.    Then he raised the heavy spear to drive it through the mighty heart,  and still Tarzan of the Apes smiled contemptuously upon him.    Before Rokoff could drive the weapon home the chief sprang upon him and  dragged him away from his intended victim.    \"Stop, white man!\" he cried.  \"Rob us of this prisoner and our  death-dance, and you yourself may have to take his place.\"    The threat proved most effective in keeping the Russian from further  assaults upon the prisoner, though he continued to stand a little apart  and hurl taunts at his enemy.  He told Tarzan that he himself was going  to eat the ape-man's heart.   He enlarged upon the horrors of the  future life of Tarzan's son, and intimated that his vengeance would  reach as well to Jane Clayton.    \"You think your wife safe in England,\" said Rokoff.   \"Poor fool!  She  is even now in the hands of one not even of decent birth, and far from  the safety of London and the protection of her friends.  I had not  meant to tell you this until I could bring to you upon Jungle Island  proof of her fate.    \"Now that you are about to die the most unthinkably horrid death that  it is given a white man to die--let this word of the plight of your  wife add to the torments that you must suffer before the last savage  spear-thrust releases you from your torture.\"    The dance had commenced now, and the yells of the circling warriors  drowned Rokoff's further attempts to distress his victim.    The leaping savages, the flickering firelight playing upon their  painted bodies, circled about the victim at the stake.    To Tarzan's memory came a similar scene, when he had rescued D'Arnot  from a like predicament at the last moment before the final  spear-thrust should have ended his sufferings.   Who was there now to  rescue him?  In all the world there was none able to save him from the  torture and the death.    The thought that these human fiends would devour him when the dance was  done caused him not a single qualm of horror or disgust.  It did not  add to his sufferings as it would have to those of an ordinary white  man, for all his life Tarzan had seen the beasts of the jungle devour  the flesh of their kills.    Had he not himself battled for the grisly forearm of a great ape at  that long-gone Dum-Dum, when he had slain the fierce Tublat and won his  niche in the respect of the Apes of Kerchak?    The dancers were leaping more closely to him now.  The spears were  commencing to find his body in the first torturing pricks that prefaced  the more serious thrusts.    It would not be long now.  The ape-man longed for the last savage lunge  that would end his misery.    And then, far"]]]
