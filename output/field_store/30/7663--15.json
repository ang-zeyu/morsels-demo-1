Owing to the size and peculiar appearance of the steamer, he was a  fair target for his enemies; and, indeed, so uncomfortably close did  some of the bullets come, that the boy almost continually kept his  head lowered, so as to be protected by the sides of the wagon.    Finally morning came, greatly to the relief of all our friends. As  soon as it was fairly light the Irishman and Yankee were notified that  a move was about to be made, by means of the steam-whistle. An  answering signal coming back to them, the steam man at once advanced  to the very edge of the ravine.    The trapper peering cautiously down the gulch, caught sight of several  red-skins crouching near the cave, and, directing young Brainerd to  discharge his piece at a certain one, the two fired nearly together.  Scarce five seconds had elapsed, when both Ethan and Mickey did the  same. All four, or rather three, as the boy gave his principal attention  to the engine, began loading and firing as rapidly as possible.    The red-skins returned a few scattering shots; but they were taken at  such disadvantage, that they immediately began a precipitate retreat  down the ravine.    Ere they had withdrawn a hundred yards, Ethan and Mickey emerged from  the cave, shouting and excited, firing at every red-skin they could  see, the Irishman occasionally swinging his gun over his head, and  daring the savages to a hand-to-hand encounter.    While the two were thus engaged, the trapper was not idle. The steam  man maintained his place but a short distance behind the enemies, and  his deadly rifle scarcely ever failed of its mark.    The moment an Indian was killed or helplessly wounded, his companions  caught and dragged him away, there being a great fear upon the part of  all that some of their number might fall into the hands of their  enemies, and suffer the ineffaceable disgrace of being scalped.    The savages were followed a long distance, until their number had  diminished down to a fraction of what it was originally, and the  survivors had all they could do in 'taking care of their disabled  comrades.    Never was victory more complete. The Indians were thoroughly  discomfited, and only too glad to get away after being so severely  punished. During this singular running fight the steam man kept up a  constant shrieking, which doubtless contributed in no slight degree to  the rout of the red-skins. They fired continually at the  fearful-looking monster, and, finding their shots produced no effect,  invested the thing with a portion of the supernatural power which they  had given it at first sight.    When the last glimpse of the retreating Indians was seen, the trapper  turned triumphantly toward the boy.    'Warn't that purty well done, younker?'    'It was indeed.'    'They'll now stay away awhile.'    'We would have failed if we had waited any longer.'    'Why so, boy?'    'Because the last stick is burned, and the steam man couldn't be made  to run a mile further without more fuel.'                            CHAPTER XVII. HOMEWARD BOUND.    THE PUNISHMENT administered to the Indians who had so greatly annoyed  the miners proved a very beneficial one.    Nothing more was seen of them, except one or two glimpses of the  red-skin upon his black horse. He, however, maintained a respectful  distance, and at the end of a day or two disappeared altogether.    These were golden moments indeed to the miners, and they improved them  to the utmost. From earliest light until the darkness of night they  toiled almost unceasingly. Half the time they went hungry rather than  stop their work to procure that which was so much needed. When,  however, the wants of nature could no longer be trifled with, Baldy  took his rifle and started off on a hunt, which was sure to be brief  and successful.    Sometimes he caught sight of some game in the gulch, and sometimes  something in the air drew the fire of his unerring rifle, and the  miners feasted and worked as only such violently laboring men can do.    Although the boy was unable to assist at the severe labor, yet he soon  demonstrated his genius and usefulness. He not only constructed a dam,  but made a 'rocker,' or machine, of an original style, that did the  work far more expeditiously and thoroughly than it had yet been done.    While the men were getting the auriferous sand, he separated it from  the particles of dirt and gravel, without any assistance from them,  and without any severe labor for himself.    There was some apprehension upon the part of all that the huge  trapper, whom young Brainerd had met at night, would make his  appearance. Should he do so, it would be certain to precipitate a  difficulty of the worst kind, as he was morose, sullen, treacherous,  envious and reckless of danger.    Baldy Bicknell really feared him more than he did the Indians, and the  constant watchfulness he exercised for several days showed how great  was his apprehension.    Fortunately, indeed, for all concerned, the giant hunter continued his  travels in a different direction, and the miners were undisturbed by  him.    Two weeks passed, by the end of which time the ravine was about  exhausted of its precious stuff, and the miners made their  preparations for going home.    It was impossible to do anything more than conjecture the amount of  wealth they had obtained, but Baldy was sure that there was enough,  when sold, to buy each of them a handsome farm.    'Jerusalem! but naow ain't that good?' exclaimed the delighted Ethan  Hopkins, as he mopped off his perspiring forehead. 'That 'ere  encourages me to take a step that I've often contemplated.'    'What might the same be?'    'Git married: me and Seraphenia Pike hev been engaged for the last ten  years, and now I'll be hanged ef I don't go home and get spliced.'    'And it's myself that'll do the same,' added Mickey, as he executed an  Irish jig on the barren earth in front of their cavern home, after  they had concluded to leave the place.    'Where does she reside?' inquired Ethan.    'Ballyduff, Kings County, in the Oim of the Sea; it's there that lives  the lass that's to have the honor of becoming Mrs. McSquizzle, and  becomin' the mither of her own children. Arrah, but isn't the same a  beauty?'    'The same as my own, Michael,' ventured the Yankee, who deemed it his  duty to correct this general remark of his friend.    'Arrah, now, get cut wid ye! she can't begin wid Miss Bridget  Moghlaghigbogh that resides wid her mither and two pigs on the  outskirts of Ballyduff, in the wee cabin that has the one room and the  one windy. Warrah, warrah, now isn't she a jewel?'    'And so is Seraphenia.'    'But has she the rid hair, that makes it onnecessary for them to have  the candle lit at night? and has she the same beautiful freckles, the  size of a ha'penny, on the face and the nose, that has such an iligant  turn up at the end, that she used to hang her bonnet on it? Arrah,  now, and didn't she have the swate teeth, six of the same that were so  broad that they filled her mouth, and it was none of yer gimblet holes  that was her mouth, but a beautiful one, that, when she smiled went  round to her ears, did the same. And her shoes! but you orter seen  them.'    'Why so?'    'What was the matter with her shoes?'    'Nothing was the same. They was the shoes that the little pigs went to  slaap in, afore they got so big that they couldn't git in them, and  then it was her brother that used one of them same for a trunk when he  emigrated to Amenity. Arrah, now, but wasn't me own Bridget a jewel?'    'Jehosephat! I should think she was!' exclaimed Hopkins, who had  listened in amazement to this enumeration of the beauties of the  gentle Irish lass, who had won the affections of Mickey McSquizzle.  'No doubt she had a sweet disposition.'    'Indeed she had, had she; it was that of an angel, was the same. It  was niver that I staid there a night coorting the same that she didn't  smash her shillaleh to smithereens over me head. Do yees obsarve  that?' asked Mickey, removing his hat, and displaying a scar that  extended half way across his head.    'I don't see how any one can help seeing that.'    'Well, that was the parting salute of Bridget, as I started for  Ameriky. Arrah, now, but she did the same in style.'    'That was her parting memento, was it?'    'Yes; I gave her the black eye, and she did the same fur me, and I  niver takes off me hat to scratch me head that I don't think of the  swate gal that I left at home.'    And thereupon the Irishman began whistling 'The Girl I Left Behind  Me,' accompanying it with a sort of waltzing dance, kept with  remarkably good time.    'And so you intend to marry her?' inquired Hopkins, with no little  amazement.    'It's that I do, ef I finds her heart fraa when I return to Ballyduff,  You know, that the loikes of her is sought by all the lads in Kings  County, and to save braaking their hearts, she may share the shanty of  some of 'em.'    'Jerusalem! but she is the all-firedest critter I ever heard tell on.'    'What does ye maan by that?' demanded the Irishman, instantly flaring  up; 'does ye maan to insinooate that she isn't the most charming  craater in the whole counthry?'    'You'll allow me to except my own Seraphenia?'    'Niver a once.'    'Then I'll do it whether you like it or not Your gal can't begin with  mine, and never could.'    'That I don't allow any man to say.'    And the Irishman immediately began divesting himself of his coat,  preparatory to settling the difference in the characteristic Irish  manner. Nothing loth, the Yankee put himself in attitude, determined  to stand up for the rights of his fair one, no matter by whom  assailed.    Matters having progressed so far, there undoubtedly would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#14)"],[1,"distant 16 or 17 leagues.

The instructions issued by Governor King were very precise.    \"You will proceed without loss of time to Basses Straights and observe  the following directions for prosecuting discoveries in those straights  on the south-west coast of this country...When you are between Ram Head  and Western Port you will proceed to Kent's Group and ascertain the size  of those islands (particularly the easternmost)...From Kent's Group you  will run on a straight course to Wilson's Promontory noticing the course  and distance, soundings and quality of the bottom...From Wilson's  Promontory you will trace the coast between Point Schanck and Cape Albany  Otway...From thence you will run to Harbinger Rock lying off the  north-west point of King's Island...You will make the circuit of that  island or islands in addition to the King's instructions respecting new  discoveries...You will carefully examine...all within 6 miles round the  island to ascertain whether a vessel may anchor. Having completed the  survey...you will ascertain the time of bearing...between the south  westernmost point and Albatross Islands, the northernmost of Hunter's  Islands and the Pyramid. Having completed...your survey thus far you will  ascertain to what distance soundings may be got to the westward of the  Norfolk's and Lady Nelson's passages taking care to traverse across to  the latitude of 42 degrees on the south side and within sight of land on  the north side or coast of New Holland (Van Dieman's Land) until between  38 and 42 degrees...As you stand in on the New Holland side you will  examine the coast between Cape Albany Otway and Cape Solicitor which  Lieutenant Grant named Portland Bay the bottom of which he did not see.  Should you have time I would wish you to run due south from Cape  Solicitor as far as 40 degrees and work back again to Cape  Bridgewater...you will employ another month...in tracing the coast from  Cape Banks...In returning to this port you will deliver all such journals  and charts as may have been completed...during your intended voyage.    \"Should you fall in with H.M.S.

And  in case you fall in and are come up with by the Naturaliste and  Geographe, French vessels on discovery, you will produce your passport  from His Grace the Duke of Portland to the Commander of that expedition.    \"PHILIP GIDLEY KING.    \"SYDNEY, October 31st, 1801.\"      CHAPTER 5.    MURRAY'S EXPLORATION OF BASS STRAIT.    The Lady Nelson set forth from Sydney on her mission on November 12th,  1801. Obeying Governor King's orders, Murray steered first towards the  Kent Group.* (* The Kent Group was discovered by Lieutenant Matthew  Flinders in the Francis, and named by him in honour of Captain William  Kent of H.M.S. Supply. The group was subsequently visited by Mr.  Rushworth and other sailors.) His log shows how he mistook other islands,  probably the Sisters* (* The Sisters Islands were so named by Captain  Furneaux in 1773 from the resemblance they bore to each other. Peron  calls them two small islands escarpes.) at the northern extremity of the  Furneaux Group, for his place of destination and how, when 25 miles to  the northward of Cape Barren, on seeing smoke rising from an island, he  sent a boat ashore and found living there two men, a woman and a child,  the men, Chase and Beven, being sealers in the employ of Messrs. Kable &  Underwood, of Sydney. The Lady Nelson was then brought to and moored in  Diana Bay, a well-known anchorage in Furneaux Islands.    Murray, at this time, seems to have been much farther southward than  Governor King intended him to go, for the island which he writes of as  Grand Capshine was undoubtedly the Grand Capuchin, the largest island of  the Furneaux Group, now known as Flinders Island.* (* Named Flinders  Island by Captain Flinders in honour of his brother, Lieutenant Samuel  Flinders, R.N.)    Diana Bay, the bay in which the Lady Nelson stayed for some days, was  formed by the shores of the Grand Capuchin and Storehouse and Cat  Islands, the last named islands being the Babel Islands of Flinders. In  very early days this bay was much frequented by sealing vessels and in  1801 gained its name from the ship Diana, a small vessel belonging to  Messrs. Kable & Underwood, of Sydney, which afterwards stranded on the  Grand Capuchin and which had a curious history. A French schooner named  L'Entreprise of Bordeaux, under the command of Captain Le Corre, last  from the Isle of France, while sealing in these waters was also wrecked  about a year later off one of the Sisters, 30 miles to the northward of  where the Diana went ashore. Le Corre and two-thirds of his crew  perished. The supercargo whose name, according to Peron, was Coxwell, but  which the Sydney Gazette prints as Coggeshall, was among the saved and  was brought with the other rescued men to Sydney. Coggeshall returned  with Mr. Underwood to endeavour to save the hull of the vessel, and  though they failed to float L'Entreprise, they were more successful as  regards the Diana which was repaired and renamed the Surprise, the name  by which the lost French schooner had been known by the English from  Governor King downwards. In order to pay expenses she was put up to  public auction in Sydney and purchased by one of the officers of  L'Entreprise for 117 guineas, but was afterwards resold to her original  owners, Messrs. Kable & Underwood.* (* See Sydney Gazettes, March 12th  and March 19th, 1803.)    Murray did not name the Grand Capuchin, for it was so called before the  time of his visit. Nor did Flinders or Bass give it that name, which was  probably derived from the cowled peak of a mountain on it, one of three  christened by Flinders the Patriarchs, combined with the fact that  Furneaux had already named some black rocky islands that lay off the  entrance to Storm Bay Passage, The Friars.* (* The Boreels Eylander of  Tasman.)
