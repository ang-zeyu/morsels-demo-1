[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#14)"],[1,"        Dear mother!    HEDWIG.  And is it surely so? Art thou unhurt?       [Gazing at him with anxious tenderness.    And is it possible he aimed at thee?  How could he do it? Oh, he has no heart--  And he could wing an arrow at his child!    FURST.  His soul was racked with anguish when he did it.  No choice was left him, but to shoot or die!    HEDWIG.  Oh, if he had a father's heart, he would  Have sooner perished by a thousand deaths!    STAUFFACHER.  You should be grateful for God's gracious care,  That ordered things so well.    HEDWIG.                  Can I forget  What might have been the issue. God of heaven!  Were I to live for centuries, I still  Should see my boy tied up,--his father's mark,  And still the shaft would quiver in my heart!    MELCHTHAL.  You know not how the viceroy taunted him!    HEDWIG.  Oh, ruthless heart of man! Offend his pride,  And reason in his breast forsakes her seat;  In his blind wrath he'll stake upon a cast  A child's existence, and a mother's heart!    BAUMGARTEN.  Is then your husband's fate not hard enough,  That you embitter it by such reproaches?  Have you no feeling for his sufferings?    HEDWIG (turning to him and gazing full upon him).  Hast thou tears only for thy friend's distress?  Say, where were you when he--my noble Tell,  Was bound in chains? Where was your friendship, then?  The shameful wrong was done before your eyes;  Patient you stood, and let your friend be dragged,  Ay, from your very hands. Did ever Tell  Act thus to you? Did he stand whining by  When on your heels the viceroy's horsemen pressed,  And full before you roared the storm-tossed lake?  Oh, not with idle tears he showed his pity;  Into the boat he sprung, forgot his home,  His wife, his children, and delivered thee!    FURST.  It had been madness to attempt his rescue,  Unarmed, and few in numbers as we were.    HEDWIG (casting herself upon his bosom).  Oh, father, and thou, too, hast lost my Tell!  The country--all have lost him! All lament  His loss; and, oh, how he must pine for us!  Heaven keep his soul from sinking to despair!  No friend's consoling voice can penetrate  His dreary dungeon walls. Should befall sick!  Ah! In the vapors of the murky vault  He must fall sick. Even as the Alpine rose  Grows pale and withers in the swampy air,  There is no life for him, but in the sun,  And in the balm of heaven's refreshing breeze.  Imprisoned? Liberty to him is breath;  He cannot live in the rank dungeon air!    STAUFFACHER.  Pray you be calm! And, hand in hand, we'll all  Combine to burst his prison doors.    HEDWIG.                    Without him,  What have you power to do? While Tell was free,  There still, indeed, was hope--weak innocence  Had still a friend, and the oppressed a stay.  Tell saved you all! You cannot all combined  Release him from his cruel prison bonds.       [The BARON wakes.    BAUMGARTEN.  Hush, hush! He starts!    ATTINGHAUSEN (sitting up).               Where is he?    STAUFFACHER.                      Who?    ATTINGHAUSEN.                          He leaves me,--  In my last moments he abandons me.    STAUFFACHER.  He means his nephew. Have they sent for him?    FURST.  He has been summoned. Cheerily, Sir! Take comfort!  He has found his heart at last, and is our own.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Say, has he spoken for his native land?    STAUFFACHER.  Ay, like a hero!    ATTINGHAUSEN.           Wherefore comes he not,  That he may take my blessing ere I die?  I feel my life fast ebbing to a close.    STAUFFACHER.  Nay, talk not thus, dear Sir! This last short sleep  Has much refreshed you, and your eye is bright.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Life is but pain, and even that has left me;  My sufferings, like my hopes, have passed away.       [Observing the boy.    What boy is that?    FURST.            Bless him. Oh, good my lord!  He is my grandson, and is fatherless.       [HEDWIG kneels with the boy before the dying man.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  And fatherless I leave you all, ay, all!  Oh, wretched fate, that these old eyes should see  My country's ruin, as they close in death.  Must I attain the utmost verge of life,  To feel my hopes go with me to the grave.    STAUFFACHER (to FURST).  Shall he depart 'mid grief and gloom like this?  Shall not his parting moments be illumed  By hope's delightful beams? My noble lord,  Raise up your drooping spirit! We are not  Forsaken quite--past all deliverance.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Who shall deliver you?    FURST.              Ourselves. For know  The Cantons three are to each other pledged  To hunt the tyrants from the land. The league  Has been concluded, and a sacred oath  Confirms our union. Ere another year  Begins its circling course--the blow shall fall.  In a free land your ashes shall repose.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  The league concluded! Is it really so?    MELCHTHAL.  On one day shall the Cantons rise together.  All is prepared to strike--and to this hour  The secret closely kept though hundreds share it;  The ground is hollow 'neath the tyrant's feet;  Their days of rule are numbered, and ere long  No trace of their dominion shall remain.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Ay, but their castles, how to master them?    MELCHTHAL.  On the same day they, too, are doomed to fall.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  And are the nobles parties to this league?    STAUFFACHER.  We trust to their assistance should we need it;  As yet the peasantry alone have sworn.    ATTINGHAUSEN (raising himself up in great astonishment).  And have the peasantry dared such a deed  On their own charge without their nobles' aid--  Relied so much on their own proper strength?  Nay then, indeed, they want our help no more;  We may go down to death cheered by the thought  That after us the majesty of man  Will live, and be maintained by other hands.       [He lays his hand upon the head of the child,     who is kneeling before him.    From this boy's head, whereon the apple lay,  Your new and better liberty shall spring;  The old is crumbling down--the times are changing  And from the ruins blooms a fairer life.    STAUFFACHER (to FURST).  See, see, what splendor streams around his eye!  This is not nature's last expiring flame,  It is the beam of renovated life.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  From their old towers the nobles are descending,  And swearing in the towns the civic oath.  In Uechtland and Thurgau the work's begun;  The noble Bern lifts her commanding head,  And Freyburg is a stronghold of the free;  The stirring Zurich calls her guilds to arms;  And now, behold! the ancient might of kings  Is shivered against her everlasting walls.       [He speaks what follows with a prophetic tone;     his utterance rising into enthusiasm.    I see the princes and their haughty peers,  Clad all in steel, come striding on to crush  A harmless shepherd race with mailed hand.  Desperate the conflict: 'tis for life or death;  And many a pass will tell to after years  Of glorious victories sealed in foemen's blood. [25]  The peasant throws himself with naked breast,  A willing victim on their serried lances.  They yield--the flower of chivalry's cut down,  And freedom waves her conquering banner high!       [Grasps the hands Of WALTER FURST and STAUFFACHER.    Hold fast together, then--forever fast!  Let freedom's haunts be one in heart and mind!  Set watches on your mountain-tops, that league  May answer league, when comes the hour to strike.  Be one--be one--be one----       [He falls back upon the cushion. His lifeless hands continue     to grasp those of FURST and STAUFFACHER, who regard him for     some moments in silence, and then retire, overcome with sorrow.     Meanwhile the servants have quietly pressed into the chamber,     testifying different degrees of grief. Some kneel down beside     him and weep on his body: while this scene is passing the castle     bell tolls.    RUDENZ (entering hurriedly).  Lives he? Oh, say, can he still hear my voice?    FURST (averting his face).  You are our seignior and protector now;  Henceforth this castle bears another name.    RUDENZ (gazing at the body with deep emotion).  Oh, God! Is my repentance, then, too late?  Could he not live some few brief moments more,  To see the change that has come o'er my heart?  Oh, I was deaf to his true counselling voice  While yet he walked on earth. Now he is gone;  Gone and forever,--leaving me the debt,--  The heavy debt I owe him--undischarged!  Oh, tell me! did he part in anger with me?    STAUFFACHER.  When dying he was told what you had done,  And blessed the valor that inspired your words!    RUDENZ (kneeling downs beside the dead body).  Yes, sacred relics of a man beloved!  Thou lifeless corpse! Here, on thy death-cold hand,  Do I abjure all foreign ties forever!  And to my country's cause devote myself.  I am a Switzer, and will act as one  With my whole heart and soul.     [Rises.                  Mourn for our friend,  Our common parent, yet be not dismayed!  'Tis not alone his lands that I inherit,--  His heart--his spirit have devolved on me;  And my young arm shall execute the task  For which his hoary age remained your debtor.  Give me your hands, ye venerable fathers!  Thine, Melchthal, too! Nay, do not hesitate,  Nor from me turn distrustfully away.  Accept my plighted vow--my knightly oath!    FURST.  Give him your hands, my friends! A heart like his  That sees and owns its error claims our trust.    MELCHTHAL.  You ever held the peasantry in scorn;  What surety have we that you mean us fair?    RUDENZ.  Oh, think not of the error of my youth!    STAUFFACHER (to MELCHTHAL).  Be one! They were our father's latest words.  See they be not forgotten! Take my hand,--  A peasant's hand,--and with it, noble Sir,  The gage and the assurance of a man!  Without us, sir, what would the nobles be?  Our order is more ancient, too, than yours!    RUDENZ.  I honor it, and with my sword will shield it!    MELCHTHAL.

Say, sir, may I hope?    MORTIMER.  Who?--he?--he is a wretch, a very coward,  Hope naught from him; despise him, and forget him!    MARY.  What say you?    MORTIMER.          He deliver, and possess you!  Why let him dare it:--he!--he must with me  In mortal contest first deserve the prize!    MARY.  You gave him not my letter? Then, indeed  My hopes are lost!    MORTIMER.            The coward loves his life.  Whoe'er would rescue you, and call you his,  Must boldly dare affront e'en death itself!    MARY.  Will he do nothing for me?    MORTIMER.                Speak not of him.  What can he do? What need have we of him?  I will release you; I alone.    MARY.                 Alas!  What power have you?    MORTIMER.             Deceive yourself no more;  Think not your case is now as formerly;  The moment that the queen thus quitted you,  And that your interview had ta'en this turn,  All hope was lost, each way of mercy shut.  Now deeds must speak, now boldness must decide,  To compass all must all be hazarded;  You must be free before the morning break.    MARY.  What say you, sir--to-night?--impossible!    MORTIMER.  Hear what has been resolved:--I led my friends  Into a private chapel, where a priest  Heard our confession, and, for every sin  We had committed, gave us absolution;  He gave us absolution too, beforehand,  For every crime we might commit in future;  He gave us too the final sacrament,  And we are ready for the final journey.    MARY.  Oh, what an awful, dreadful preparation!    MORTIMER.  We scale, this very night, the castle's walls;  The keys are in my power; the guards we murder!  Then from thy chamber bear thee forcibly.  Each living soul must die beneath our hands,  That none remain who might disclose the deed.    MARY.  And Drury, Paulet, my two keepers, they  Would sooner spill their dearest drop of blood.    MORTIMER.  They fall the very first beneath my steel.    MARY.  What, sir! Your uncle? How! Your second father!    MORTIMER.  Must perish by my hand--I murder him!    MARY.  Oh, bloody outrage!    MORTIMER.             We have been absolved  Beforehand; I may perpetrate the worst;  I can, I will do so!    MARY.             Oh, dreadful, dreadful!    MORTIMER.  And should I be obliged to kill the queen,  I've sworn upon the host, it must be done!    MARY.  No, Mortimer; ere so much blood for me----    MORTIMER.  What is the life of all compared to thee,  And to my love? The bond which holds the world  Together may be loosed, a second deluge  Come rolling on, and swallow all creation!  Henceforth I value nothing; ere I quit  My hold on thee, may earth and time be ended!    MARY (retiring)  Heavens! Sir, what language, and what looks! They scare,  They frighten me!    MORTIMER (with unsteady looks, expressive of great madness).            Life's but a moment--death  Is but a moment too. Why! let them drag me  To Tyburn, let them tear me limb from limb,  With red-hot pincers----     [Violently approaching her with extended arms.              If I clasp but thee  Within my arms, thou fervently beloved!    MARY.  Madman, avaunt!    MORTIMER.           To rest upon this bosom,  To press upon this passion-breathing mouth----    MARY.  Leave me, for God's sake, sir; let me go in----    MORTIMER.  He is a madman who neglects to clasp  His bliss in folds that never may be loosed,  When Heaven has kindly given it to his arms.  I will deliver you, and though it cost  A thousand lives, I do it; but I swear,  As God's in Heaven I will possess you too!    MARY.  Oh! will no God, no angel shelter me?  Dread destiny! thou throwest me, in thy wrath,  From one tremendous terror to the other!  Was I then born to waken naught but frenzy?  Do hate and love conspire alike to fright me!    MORTIMER.  Yes, glowing as their hatred is my love;  They would behead thee, they would wound this neck,  So dazzling white, with the disgraceful axe!  Oh! offer to the living god of joy  What thou must sacrifice to bloody hate!  Inspire thy happy lover with those charms  Which are no more thine own. Those golden locks  Are forfeit to the dismal powers of death,  Oh! use them to entwine thy slave forever!    MARY.  Alas! alas! what language must I hear!  My woe, my sufferings should be sacred to you,  Although my royal brows are so no more.    MORTIMER.  The crown is fallen from thy brows, thou hast  No more of earthly majesty. Make trial,  Raise thy imperial voice, see if a friend,  If a deliverer will rise to save you.  Thy moving form alone remains, the high,  The godlike influence of thy heavenly beauty;  This bids me venture all, this arms my hand  With might, and drives me tow'rd the headsman's axe.    MARY.  Oh! who will save me from his raging madness?    MORTIMER.  Service that's bold demands a bold reward.  Why shed their blood the daring? Is not life  Life's highest good? And he a madman who  Casts life away? First will I take my rest,  Upon the breast that glows with love's own fire!       [He presses her violently to his bosom.    MARY.  Oh, must I call for help against the man  Who would deliver me!    MORTIMER.              Thou'rt not unfeeling,  The world ne'er censured thee for frigid rigor;  The fervent prayer of love can touch thy heart.  Thou mad'st the minstrel Rizzio blest, and gavest  Thyself a willing prey to Bothwell's arms.    MARY.  Presumptuous man!    MORTIMER.            He was indeed thy tyrant,  Thou trembled'st at his rudeness, whilst thou loved'st him;  Well, then--if only terror can obtain thee--  By the infernal gods!    MARY.              Away--you're mad!    MORTIMER.  I'll teach thee then before me, too, to tremble.    KENNEDY (entering suddenly).  They're coming--they approach--the park is filled  With men in arms.    MORTIMER (starting and catching at his sword).            I will defend you-I----    MARY.  O Hannah! save me, save me from his hands.  Where shall I find, poor sufferer, an asylum?  Oh! to what saint shall I address my prayers?  Here force assails me, and within is murder!       [She flies towards the house, KENNEDY follows her.          SCENE VII.       MORTIMER, PAULET, and DRURY rush in in the greatest     consternation. Attendants hasten over the stage.    PAULET.  Shut all the portals--draw the bridges up.    MORTIMER.  What is the matter, uncle?    PAULET.                Where is the murderess?  Down with her, down into the darkest dungeon!    MORTIMER.  What is the matter? What has passed?    PAULET.                      The queen!  Accursed hand! Infernal machination!    MORTIMER.  The queen! What queen?    PAULET.               What queen! The Queen of England;  She has been murdered on the road to London.       [Hastens into the house.        SCENE VIII.       MORTIMER, soon after O'KELLY.    MORTIMER (after a pause).  Am I then mad? Came not one running by  But now, and cried aloud, the queen is murdered!  No, no! I did but dream. A feverish fancy  Paints that upon my mind as true and real,  Which but existed in my frantic thoughts.  Who's there? It is O'Kelly. So dismayed!    O'KELLY (rushing in).  Flee, Mortimer, oh! flee--for all is lost!    MORTIMER.  What then is lost?    O'KELLY.            Stand not on question. Think  On speedy flight.    MORTIMER.           What has occurred?    O'KELLY.                     Sauvage,  That madman, struck the blow.    MORTIMER.                  It is then true!    O'KELLY.  True, true--oh! save yourself.    MORTIMER (exultingly).                  The queen is murdered--  And Mary shall ascend the English throne!    O'KELLY.  Is murdered! Who said that?    MORTIMER.                 Yourself.    O'KELLY.               She lives,  And I, and you, and all of us are lost.    MORTIMER.  She lives!    O'KELLY.        The blow was badly aimed, her cloak  Received it. Shrewsbury disarmed the murderer.    MORTIMER.  She lives!    O'KELLY.        She lives to whelm us all in ruin;  Come, they surround the park already; come.    MORTIMER.  Who did this frantic deed?    O'KELLY.                It was the monk  From Toulon, whom you saw immersed in thought,  As in the chapel the pope's bull was read,  Which poured anathemas upon the queen.  He wished to take the nearest, shortest way,  To free, with one bold stroke, the church of God,  And gain the crown of martyrdom: he trusted  His purpose only to the priest, and struck  The fatal blow upon the road to London.    MORTIMER (after a long silence).  Alas! a fierce, destructive fate pursues thee,  Unhappy one! Yes--now thy death is fixed;  Thy very angel has prepared thy fall!    O'KELLY.  Say, whither will you take your flight? I go  To hide me in the forests of the north.    MORTIMER.  Fly thither, and may God attend your flight;  I will remain, and still attempt to save  My love; if not, my bed shall be upon her grave.              [Exeunt at different sides.          ACT IV.

How happened it? How was it possible  That in the midst of this most loyal people----    LEICESTER.  The deed was not attempted by the people.
