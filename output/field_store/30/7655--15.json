He would appear as one of them.  They would be  sullen brothers in distress, and he could then easily believe he had  not run any farther or faster than they.  And if he himself could  believe in his virtuous perfection, he conceived that there would be  small trouble in convincing all others.    He said, as if in excuse for this hope, that previously the army had  encountered great defeats and in a few months had shaken off all blood  and tradition of them, emerging as bright and valiant as a new one;  thrusting out of sight the memory of disaster, and appearing with the  valor and confidence of unconquered legions.  The shrilling voices of  the people at home would pipe dismally for a time, but various generals  were usually compelled to listen to these ditties.  He of course felt  no compunctions for proposing a general as a sacrifice.  He could not  tell who the chosen for the barbs might be, so he could center no  direct sympathy upon him.  The people were afar and he did not conceive  public opinion to be accurate at long range.  It was quite probable  they would hit the wrong man who, after he had recovered from his  amazement would perhaps spend the rest of his days in writing replies  to the songs of his alleged failure.  It would be very unfortunate, no  doubt, but in this case a general was of no consequence to the youth.    In a defeat there would be a roundabout vindication of himself.  He  thought it would prove, in a manner, that he had fled early because of  his superior powers of perception.  A serious prophet upon predicting a  flood should be the first man to climb a tree.  This would demonstrate  that he was indeed a seer.    A moral vindication was regarded by the youth as a very important  thing.  Without salve, he could not, he thought, wear the sore badge of  his dishonor through life.  With his heart continually assuring him  that he was despicable, he could not exist without making it, through  his actions, apparent to all men.    If the army had gone gloriously on he would be lost.  If the din meant  that now his army's flags were tilted forward he was a condemned  wretch.  He would be compelled to doom himself to isolation.  If the  men were advancing, their indifferent feet were trampling upon his  chances for a successful life.    As these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he turned upon them  and tried to thrust them away.  He denounced himself as a villain.  He  said that he was the most unutterably selfish man in existence.  His  mind pictured the soldiers who would place their defiant bodies before  the spear of the yelling battle fiend, and as he saw their dripping  corpses on an imagined field, he said that he was their murderer.    Again he thought that he wished he was dead.  He believed that he  envied a corpse.  Thinking of the slain, he achieved a great contempt  for some of them, as if they were guilty for thus becoming lifeless.  They might have been killed by lucky chances, he said, before they had  had opportunities to flee or before they had been really tested.  Yet  they would receive laurels from tradition.  He cried out bitterly that  their crowns were stolen and their robes of glorious memories were  shams.  However, he still said that it was a great pity he was not as  they.    A defeat of the army had suggested itself to him as a means of escape  from the consequences of his fall.  He considered, now, however, that  it was useless to think of such a possibility.  His education had been  that success for that mighty blue machine was certain; that it would  make victories as a contrivance turns out buttons.  He presently  discarded all his speculations in the other direction.  He returned to  the creed of soldiers.    When he perceived again that it was not possible for the army to be  defeated, he tried to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take  back to his regiment, and with it turn the expected shafts of derision.    But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it became impossible for him  to invent a tale he felt he could trust.  He experimented with many  schemes, but threw them aside one by one as flimsy.  He was quick to  see vulnerable places in them all.    Furthermore, he was much afraid that some arrow of scorn might lay him  mentally low before he could raise his protecting tale.    He imagined the whole regiment saying:  \"Where's Henry Fleming?  He  run, didn't 'e?  Oh, my!\"  He recalled various persons who would be  quite sure to leave him no peace about it.  They would doubtless  question him with sneers, and laugh at his stammering hesitation.  In  the next engagement they would try to keep watch of him to discover  when he would run.    Wherever he went in camp, he would encounter insolent and lingeringly  cruel stares.  As he imagined himself passing near a crowd of comrades,  he could hear one say, \"There he goes!\"    Then, as if the heads were moved by one muscle, all the faces were  turned toward him with wide, derisive grins.  He seemed to hear some  one make a humorous remark in a low tone.  At it the others all crowed  and cackled.  He was a slang phrase.          Chapter 12      The column that had butted stoutly at the obstacles in the roadway was  barely out of the youth's sight before he saw dark waves of men come  sweeping out of the woods and down through the fields.  He knew at once  that the steel fibers had been washed from their hearts.  They were  bursting from their coats and their equipments as from entanglements.  They charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.    Behind them blue smoke curled and clouded above the treetops, and  through the thickets he could sometimes see a distant pink glare.  The  voices of the cannon were clamoring in interminable chorus.    The youth was horrorstricken.  He stared in agony and amazement.  He  forgot that he was engaged in combating the universe.  He threw aside  his mental pamphlets on the philosophy of the retreated and rules for  the guidance of the damned.    The fight was lost.  The dragons were coming with invincible strides.  The army, helpless in the matted thickets and blinded by the  overhanging night, was going to be swallowed.  War, the red animal,  war, the blood-swollen god, would have bloated fill.    Within him something bade to cry out.  He had the impulse to make a  rallying speech, to sing a battle hymn, but he could only get his  tongue to call into the air:  \"Why--why--what--what 's th' matter?\"    Soon he was in the midst of them.  They were leaping and scampering all  about him.  Their blanched faces shone in the dusk.  They seemed, for  the most part, to be very burly men.  The youth turned from one to  another of them as they galloped along.  His incoherent questions were  lost.  They were heedless of his appeals.  They did not seem to see him.    They sometimes gabbled insanely.  One huge man was asking of the sky:  \"Say, where de plank road?  Where de plank road!\"  It was as if he had  lost a child.  He wept in his pain and dismay.    Presently, men were running hither and thither in all ways.  The  artillery booming, forward, rearward, and on the flanks made jumble of  ideas of direction.  Landmarks had vanished into the gathered gloom.  The youth began to imagine that he had got into the center of the  tremendous quarrel, and he could perceive no way out of it.  From the  mouths of the fleeing men came a thousand wild questions, but no one  made answers.    The youth, after rushing about and throwing interrogations at the  heedless bands of retreating infantry, finally clutched a man by the  arm.  They swung around face to face.    \"Why--why--\" stammered the youth struggling with his balking tongue.    The man screamed:  \"Let go me!  Let go me!\"  His face was livid and his  eyes were rolling uncontrolled.  He was heaving and panting.  He still  grasped his rifle, perhaps having forgotten to release his hold upon  it.  He tugged frantically, and the youth being compelled to lean  forward was dragged several paces.    \"Let go me!  Let go me!\"    \"Why--why--\" stuttered the youth.    \"Well, then!\" bawled the man in a lurid rage.  He adroitly and fiercely  swung his rifle.  It crushed upon the youth's head.  The man ran on.    The youth's fingers had turned to paste upon the other's arm.  The  energy was smitten from his muscles.  He saw the flaming wings of  lightning flash before his vision.  There was a deafening rumble of  thunder within his head.    Suddenly his legs seemed to die.  He sank writhing to the ground.  He  tried to arise.  In his efforts against the numbing pain he was like a  man wrestling with a creature of the air.    There was a sinister struggle.    Sometimes he would achieve a position half erect, battle with the air  for a moment, and then fall again, grabbing at the grass.  His face was  of a clammy pallor.  Deep groans were wrenched from him.    At last, with a twisting movement, he got upon his hands and knees, and  from thence, like a babe trying to walk, to his feet.  Pressing his  hands to his temples he went lurching over the grass.    He fought an intense battle with his body.  His dulled senses wished  him to swoon and he opposed them stubbornly, his mind portraying  unknown dangers and mutilations if he should fall upon the field.  He  went tall soldier fashion.  He imagined secluded spots where he could  fall and be unmolested.  To search for one he strove against the tide  of pain.    Once he put his hand to the top of his head and timidly touched the  wound.  The scratching pain of the contact made him draw a long breath  through his clinched teeth.  His fingers were dabbled with blood.  He  regarded them with a fixed stare.    Around him he could hear the grumble of jolted cannon as the scurrying  horses were lashed toward the front.  Once, a young officer on a  besplashed charger nearly ran him down.  He turned and watched the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#14)"],[1,"citizen, need not  herself be native or naturalized!\" In 1892 the Utah Commission made to the  Secretary of the Interior a report which gave it as their opinion that the  sanction of the Church had been withdrawn only temporarily in regard to  polygamous practices, and would be restored after a political purpose had  been served. That same year a party was formed calling itself the \"Liberal  Party,\" and it carried Salt Lake City in the first election in which  National party lines were drawn. This was one plank of its platform:  \"Anxious as every Liberal is to see every difference adjusted, as anxious  as they are to exercise the utmost privileges accorded to the most favored  Americans, they remember what first caused clashing here was the presence  and control of an unyielding Theocracy and an _imperium in imperio_, and  they cannot fail to note that at the last conference of this theocratic  organization the old assumptions were all renewed.\" They therefore  deprecated immediate Statehood. The bill granting it passed Congress in  1894. The Republican, Democratic and Populist parties in Utah all favored  Statehood, and at the election following the Constitutional Convention  these parties all inserted planks favoring free coinage of silver 16 to 1,  demanding the return by government of \"real estate belonging to the Mormon  Church,\" and favoring the retention of woman suffrage.    The women of Utah were greatly in evidence during the late presidential  election. Several of them were candidates for office; but it is a  significant fact that, even in Utah, and even on the Republico-Demo-  Populist ticket, the women's vote ran far behind that for the men. \"The  Salt Lake Herald\" for November 13, 1896, records the fact that \"Woman  suffrage gave Utah to Bryan,\" and in another place it says: \"The women on  both tickets polled a small number of votes.\" Martha Cannon, who was  elected State Senator, obtained 8,167 votes. The men on the same ticket,  elected to the same office, polled, respectively, 9,875, 9,355, 9,244,  9,036 votes. Mrs. Cannon was on the free silver ticket against her  husband, who was nominated for the same office on the Republican ticket.  Of the other candidates for the senatorships on that ticket, four were men  and one a woman. The men's vote stood: 6,405, 6,197, 6,129, 5,961. The  woman's was 4,692. The only woman put up for State Representative ran  2,000 votes behind her ticket. One man only, \"the ex-dog-catcher\" of the  county, fell below her. The woman's vote was 4,879, the dog-catcher's  4,325.    I copy from the \"Salt Lake Herald\" a few sentences taken from an interview  with Mrs. Cannon, State Senator elect. When asked if she was a strong  believer in woman suffrage, she answered: \"Of course I am. It will help  women, and it will purify politics. Women are better than men. Slaves are  always better than their masters.\" \"Do you refer to polygamy?\" was asked.  \"Indeed I do not,\" she answered. \"I believe in polygamy. My father and  mother were Mormons, and I am a Mormon.... A plural wife isn't half as  much of a slave as a single wife. If her husband has four wives, she has  three weeks of freedom every single month.... Of course it is all at an  end now, but I think the women of Utah think, with me, that we were better  off in polygamy.... Sixty per cent. of the voters of this State are women.  We control the State.... What am I going to do with my children while I am  making the laws for the State? The same thing I have done with them when I  have been practicing medicine. They have been left to themselves a good  deal.... Some day there will be a law compelling people to have no more  than a certain amount of children, and the mothers of the land can live as  they ought to live.\" This is the character and opinion presented by the  highest State official that woman suffrage has as yet given to the United  States. Comment upon it seems unnecessary, so far as it would be needed to  express the disgust of the majority of American women at such sentiments  and such a situation. But has any Suffrage speaker or meeting denounced  them, or deprecated the result of the election? I have heard of none. The  National Suffrage Convention, which was held in Iowa, in January, 1897,  had the newly-elected Populist women as guests of honor, and held a  jubilation over the two new Suffrage States--Utah and Idaho. Idaho has  elected a Populist woman or two. The vote in that State in favor of the  gold standard and that against woman suffrage tally within forty-two  votes.    The instinctive alliance of the Woman Suffrage movement with the uncertain  and dangerous elements in our political life is well exemplified by the  campaign in California in connection with the late presidential election.  Mrs. Barclay Hazard, who was almost the sole woman to express publicly the  opposition which the majority of women felt, to the Suffrage idea, has  given me the following clear account of the conditions and result. She  says: \"If the advocates of Woman Suffrage give a really frank and truthful  answer to the question, 'What caused the defeat of the movement in the  late campaign in California?' they must reply, 'Public sentiment was  against it.' In all fairness, there is no other reason. Let us consider  the conditions under which the campaign was carried on. In the first  place, the Suffragists were most fortunate in choosing a time when the  whole country, as well as the State of California, was torn by a question  of such vital importance to continued life and well-being that all other  matters were in danger of going by default.    \"Second: They were extremely well organized and had command of a campaign  fund of no mean magnitude, which enabled them to keep in the field such  able and experienced agitators as Miss Susan B. Anthony and the Rev. Anna  Shaw, to say nothing of numerous lesser lights.    \"Third: There was absolutely no organized opposition to the movement. The  women who disapproved were as a rule entirely unaccustomed to public  speaking and were averse to coming forward in any way. They remonstrated  in private but would not express their views openly.    \"Fourth: Last but by no means least, our Suffrage friends may be said to  have had the press of the State with them. The 'Los Angeles Times' (the  most influential paper in the southern part of the State) cannot be said  to have aided the movement, neither did it actively antagonize it beyond  admitting to its columns occasionally letters from the 'Antis.' Yet for  this small opposition I heard an ardent advocate propose that the  Suffragists should boycott the paper!    \"Now, was ever a cause fought for under conditions more conducive to  success? 'Every thing,' to use a current slang phrase, 'seemed to be going  their way.' They fully expected to win, and those of us most opposed to  their ideas in private sadly conceded their probable victory. The result  when it came was all the more a surprise and blow to the Suffragists and a  welcome reassurance to the friends of stability and conservatism. The  figures show us that while the stronghold of Populism, the South, went for  the measure, Alameda County turned the scale. One must know California to  realize what that means. Alameda County contains the city of Oakland,  which is admittedly the most respectable and moral city in California; it  also contains the town of Berkeley, which is the home of the University of  California with its large faculty of clever men, most of them from the  East. Yes, it was here in the stronghold of morals and intellect that the  Woman Suffrage movement in California met its fate.\"    A question constantly and properly asked is: \"How does woman suffrage work  where it is exercised?\" So far as I can obtain information, where it has  worked at all, it has been detrimental to women and to the State.    Of Wyoming there is much testimony to the fact that during the Territorial  period (1868-'89) women did little voting, and played no appreciable part  in political life. Populism and Free Coinage had begun to play a prominent  part in the whole section when Wyoming was admitted to Statehood in 1890.  At the election that followed its admission there was a fusion that  resulted in the election of a Populist Governor, and such was the riotous  state of feeling that the Governor was obliged to enter the State House  through a broken window. A year later this same Governor, in his annual  message, proclaimed woman suffrage to be a notable success. As a proof, he  pointed to the fact that there were no criminals in the State, and that  the jails were empty. A little research into official documents showed  that there might be other reasons, because the criminals and those guilty  of small offences were at that time lodged in other States, and a year  later, when the authorities took possession of Laramie Prison, given by  the Government, and brought home their evil-doers, they outnumbered, in  proportion to population, those of New Mexico, which certainly should be a  fair place for comparison.    For a time, women served on juries, and there is testimony to the fact  that in many respects they served well. But the practice of calling them  was soon suspended, and never has been renewed. The only public office of  consequence held by them was bestowed by the Republicans but a year or two  ago, when Miss Reel was made State Superintendent of Schools. In our late  crucial election, Wyoming and its woman suffrage gave their voices for  Populism and Free Coinage. The scale hung in the balance. Why, if woman is  a greater political power for good than man, did she not turn it for the  principles which the State had held were best? The true test of the  working of woman suffrage lies in a study of the legislation connected  with it, and this will be presented under its appropriate heading.    The scenes of shameful defiance of law and order in the midst of which"]]]
