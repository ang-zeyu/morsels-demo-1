For when He had read the scriptural prophecy of  Himself in the book that was delivered to Him, He did not give it again  to the minister, until He had closed it with his own most sacred hands.  By which students are most clearly taught that in the care of books the  merest trifles ought not to be neglected.        CHAPTER XVIII    SHOWETH THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED SO GREAT STORE OF BOOKS FOR THE COMMON  BENEFIT OF SCHOLARS AND NOT ONLY FOR OUR OWN PLEASURE    Nothing in human affairs is more unjust than that those things which  are most righteously done, should be perverted by the slanders of  malicious men, and that one should bear the reproach of sin where he  has rather deserved the hope of honour.  Many things are done with  singleness of eye, the right hand knoweth not what the left hand doth,  the lump is uncorrupted by leaven, nor is the garment woven of wool and  linen; and yet by the trickery of perverse men a pious work is  mendaciously transformed into some monstrous act.  Certes, such is the  unhappy condition of sinful nature, that not merely in acts that are  morally doubtful it adopts the worse conclusion; but often it depraves  by iniquitous subversion those which have the appearance of rectitude.    For although the love of books from the nature of its object bears the  aspect of goodness, yet, wonderful to say, it has rendered us obnoxious  to the censures of many, by whose astonishment we were disparaged and  censured, now for excess of curiosity, now for the exhibition of  vanity, now for intemperance of delight in literature; though indeed we  were no more disturbed by their vituperation than by the barking of so  many dogs, satisfied with the testimony of Him to whom it appertaineth  to try the hearts and reins.  For as the aim and purpose of our inmost  will is inscrutable to men and is seen of God alone, the searcher of  hearts, they deserve to be rebuked for their pernicious temerity, who  so eagerly set a mark of condemnation upon human acts, the ultimate  springs of which they cannot see.  For the final end in matters of  conduct holds the same position as first principles in speculative  science or axioms in mathematics, as the chief of philosophers,  Aristotle, points out in the seventh book of the Ethics.  And  therefore, just as the truth of our conclusions depends upon the  correctness of our premises, so in matters of action the stamp of moral  rectitude is given by the honesty of aim and purpose, in cases where  the act itself would otherwise be held to be morally indifferent.    Now we have long cherished in our heart of hearts the fixed resolve,  when Providence should grant a favourable opportunity, to found in  perpetual charity a Hall in the reverend university of Oxford, the  chief nursing mother of all liberal arts, and to endow it with the  necessary revenues, for the maintenance of a number of scholars; and  moreover to enrich the Hall with the treasures of our books, that all  and every of them should be in common as regards their use and study,  not only to the scholars of the said Hall, but by their means to all  the students of the before-named university for ever, in the form and  manner which the following chapter shall declare.  Wherefore the  sincere love of study and zeal for the strengthening of the orthodox  faith to the edifying of the Church, have begotten in us that  solicitude so marvellous to the lovers of pelf, of collecting books  wherever they were to be purchased, regardless of expense, and of  having those that could not he bought fairly transcribed.    For as the favourite occupations of men are variously distinguished  according to the disposition of the heavenly bodies, which frequently  control our natural composition, so that some men choose to devote  themselves to architecture, others to agriculture, others to hunting,  others to navigation, others to war, others to games, we have under the  aspect of Mercury entertained a blameless pleasure in books, which  under the rule of right reason, over which no stars are dominant, we  have ordered to the glory of the Supreme Being, that where our minds  found tranquillity and peace, thence also might spring a most devout  service of God.  And therefore let our detractors cease, who are as  blind men judging of colours; let not bats venture to speak of light;  and let not those who carry beams in their own eyes presume to pull the  mote out of their brother's eye. Let them cease to jeer with satirical  taunts at things of which they are ignorant, and to discuss hidden  things that are not revealed to the eyes of men; who perchance would  have praised and commended us, if we had spent our time in hunting,  dice-playing, or courting the smiles of ladies.        CHAPTER XIX    OF THE MANNER OF LENDING ALL OUR BOOKS TO STUDENTS    It has ever been difficult so to restrain men by the laws of rectitude,  that the astuteness of successors might not strive to transgress the  bounds of their predecessors, and to infringe established rules in  insolence of licence.  Accordingly, with the advice of prudent men, we  have prescribed the manner in which we desire that the communication  and use of our books should be permitted for the benefit of students.    Imprimis, we give and grant all and singular the books, of which we  have made a special catalogue, in consideration of affection, to the  community of scholars living in ---- Hall at Oxford, as a perpetual  gift, for our soul and the souls of our parents, and also for the soul  of the most illustrious King Edward the Third from the Conquest, and of  the most pious Queen Philippa, his consort: to the intent that the same  books may be lent from time to time to all and singular the scholars  and masters of the said place, as well regular as secular, for the  advancement and use of study, in the manner immediately following, that  is to say:    Five of the scholars sojourning in the Hall aforesaid shall be  appointed by the Master thereof, who shall have the charge of all the  books, of which five persons three and not fewer may lend any book or  books for inspection and study; but for copying or transcribing we  direct that no book shall be allowed outside the walls of the house.  Therefore, when any scholar secular or religious, whom for this purpose  we regard with equal favour, shall seek to borrow any book, let the  keepers diligently consider if they have a duplicate of the said book,  and if so, let them lend him the book, taking such pledge as in their  judgment exceeds the value of the book delivered, and let a record be  made forthwith of the pledge and of the book lent, containing the names  of the persons delivering the book and of the person who receives it,  together with the day and year when the loan is made.    But if the keepers find that the book asked for is not in duplicate,  they shall not lend such book to any one whomsoever, unless he shall  belong to the community of scholars of the said Hall, unless perhaps  for inspection within the walls of the aforesaid house or Hall, but not  to be carried beyond it.    But to any of the scholars of the said Hall, any book may be lent by  three of the aforesaid keepers, after first recording, however, his  name, with the day on which he receives the book.  Nevertheless, the  borrower may not lend the book entrusted to him to another, except with  the permission of three of the aforesaid keepers, and then the name of  the first borrower being erased, the name of the second with the time  of delivery is to be recorded.    Each keeper shall take an oath to observe all these regulations when  they enter upon the charge of the books.  And the recipients of any  book or books shall thereupon swear that they will not use the book or  books for any other purpose but that of inspection or study, and that  they will not take or permit to be taken it or them beyond the town and  suburbs of Oxford.    Moreover, every year the aforesaid keepers shall render an account to  the Master of the House and two of his scholars whom he shall associate  with himself, or if he shall not be at leisure, he shall appoint three  inspectors, other than the keepers, who shall peruse the catalogue of  books, and see that they have them all, either in the volumes  themselves or at least as represented by deposits.  And the more  fitting season for rendering this account we believe to be from the  First of July until the festival of the Translation of the Glorious  Martyr S.  Thomas next following.    We add this further provision, that anyone to whom a book has been  lent, shall once a year exhibit it to the keepers, and shall, if he  wishes it, see his pledge.  Moreover, if it chances that a book is lost  by death, theft, fraud, or carelessness, he who has lost it or his  representative or executor shall pay the value of the book and receive  back his deposit.  But if in any wise any profit shall accrue to the  keepers, it shall not be applied to any purpose but the repair and  maintenance of the books.        CHAPTER XX    AN EXHORTATION TO SCHOLARS TO REQUITE US BY PIOUS PRAYERS    Time now clamours for us to terminate this treatise which we have  composed concerning the love of books; in which we have endeavoured to  give the astonishment of our contemporaries the reason why we have  loved books so greatly.  But because it is hardly granted to mortals to  accomplish aught that is not rolled in the dust of vanity, we do not  venture entirely to justify the zealous love which we have so long had  for books, or to deny that it may perchance sometimes have been the  occasion of some venial negligence, albeit the object of our love is  honourable and our intention upright.  For if when we have done  everything, we are bound to call ourselves unprofitable servants; if  the most holy Job was afraid of all his works; if according to Isaiah  all our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#14)"],[1," ghazeeyeh spat at them in an assumed anger, and said that none but  swine of Beni Hassan would send a woman away hungry. And because the  dancing-girl has power in the land, the Sheikh-el-beled waved his hand  towards the cafe, hastily calling the name of a favourite dish. Eyes  turned unconcernedly towards the brown clattering ankles of the two as  they entered the cafe and seated themselves immediately behind where the  Sheikh-el-beled squatted. Presently Dicky listened to as sombre a tale  as ever was told in the darkest night. The voice of the tale-teller was  that of Ibrahim, and the story was this: that the citadel at Cairo was  to be seized, that the streets of Alexandria were to be swept free of  Europeans, that every English official between Cairo and Kordofan was to  be slain. Mahommed Ibrahim, the spy, who knew English as well as Donovan  Pasha knew Arabic, was this very night to kill Fielding Bey with his own  hand!    This night was always associated in Dicky's mind with the memory of  stewed camel's-meat. At Ibrahim's words he turned his head from the rank  steam, and fingered his pistol in the loose folds of his Arab trousers.  The dancing-girl saw the gesture and laid a hand upon his arm.    \"Thou art one against a thousand,\" she whispered; \"wait till thou art  one against one.\"    He dipped his nose in the camel-stew, for some one poked a head in at  the door--every sense in him was alert, every instinct alive.    \"To-night,\" said Mahommed Ibrahim, in the hoarse gutturals of the  Bishareen, \"it is ordered that Fielding Bey shall die--and by my hand,  mine own, by the mercy of God! And after Fielding Bey the clean-faced  ape that cast the evil eye upon me yesterday, and bade me die. 'An old  man had three sons,' said he, the infidel dog, 'one was a thief, another  a rogue, and the third a soldier--and the soldier died first.' 'A camel  of Bagdad,' he called me. Into the belly of a dead camel shall he go, be  sewn up like a cat's liver in a pudding, and cast into the Nile before  God gives tomorrow a sun.\"    Dicky pushed away the camel-stew. \"It is time to go,\" he said.    The ghdzeeyeh rose with a laugh, caught Dicky by the hand, sprang out  among the Arabs, and leapt over the head of the village barber, calling  them all \"useless, sodden greybeards, with no more blood than a Nile  shad, poorer than monkeys, beggars of Beni Hassan!\" Taking from her  pocket a handful of quarter-piastres, she turned on her heels and tossed  them among the Arabs with a contemptuous laugh. Then she and Dicky  disappeared into the night.      II    When Dicky left her house, clothed in his own garments once more, but  the stains of henna still on his face and hands and ankles, he pressed  into the ghazeeyeh's hand ten gold-pieces. She let them fall to the  ground.    \"Love is love, effendi,\" she said. \"Money do they give me for what is no  love. She who gives freely for love takes naught in return but love, by  the will of God!\" And she laid a hand upon his arm.    \"There is work to do!\" said Dicky; and his hand dropped to where his  pistol lay--but not to threaten her. He was thinking of others.    \"To-morrow,\" she said; \"to-morrow for that, effendi,\" and her beautiful  eyes hung upon his.    \"There's corn in Egypt, but who knows who'll reap it to-morrow? And I  shall be in Cairo to-morrow.\"    \"I also shall be in Cairo to-morrow, O my lord and master!\" she  answered.    \"God give you safe journey,\" answered Dicky, for he knew it was useless  to argue with a woman. He was wont to say that you can resolve all women  into the same simple elements in the end.    Dicky gave a long perplexed whistle as he ran softly under the palms  towards the Amenhotep, lounging on the mud bank. Then he dismissed  the dancing-girl from his mind, for there was other work to do. How he  should do it he planned as he opened the door of Fielding's cabin softly  and saw him in a deep sleep.    He was about to make haste on deck again, where his own nest was, when,  glancing through the window, he saw Mahommed Ibrahim stealing down the  bank to the boat's side. He softly drew-to the little curtain of the  cabin window, leaving only one small space through which the moonlight  streamed. This ray of light fell just across the door through which  Mahommed Ibrahim would enter. The cabin was a large one, the bed was in  the middle. At the head was a curtain slung to protect the sleeper from  the cold draughts of the night.    Dicky heard a soft footstep in the companionway, then before the door.  He crept behind the curtain. Mahommed Ibrahim was listening without.  Now the door opened very gently, for this careful Orderly had oiled  the hinges that very day. The long flabby face, with the venomous eyes,  showed in the streak of moonlight. Mahommed Ibrahim slid inside, took a  step forward and drew a long knife from his sleeve. Another move towards  the sleeping man, and he was near the bed; another, and he was beside  it, stooping over...    Now, a cold pistol suddenly thrust in your face is disconcerting, no  matter how well laid your plans. It was useless for the Orderly to raise  his hand: a bullet is quicker than the muscles of the arm and the stroke  of a knife.    The two stood silent an instant, the sleeping man peaceful between  them. Dicky made a motion of his head towards the door. Mahommed Ibrahim  turned. Dicky did not lower his pistol as the Orderly, obeying, softly  went as he had softly come. Out through the doorway, up the stairs,  then upon the moonlit deck, the cold muzzle of the pistol at the head of  Mahommed Ibrahim.    Dicky turned now, and faced him, the pistol still pointed.    Then Mahommed Ibrahim spoke. \"Malaish!\" he said. That was contempt. It  was Mahommedan resignation; it was the inevitable. \"Malaish--no matter!\"  he said again; and \"no matter\" was in good English.    Dicky's back was to the light, the Orderly's face in the full glow of  it. Dicky was standing beside the wire communicating with the engineer's  cabin. He reached out his hand and pulled the hook. The bell rang below.  The two above stood silent, motionless, the pistol still levelled.    Holgate, the young Yorkshire engineer, pulled himself up to the deck  two steps of the ladder at a time. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, coming forward  quickly, but stopping short when he saw the levelled pistol. \"Drop the  knife, Ibrahim,\" said Dicky in a low voice. The Orderly dropped the  knife.    \"Get it, Holgate,\" said Dicky; and Holgate stooped and picked it up.  Then he told Holgate the story in a few words. The engineer's fingers  tightened on the knife.    \"Put it where it will be useful, Holgate,\" said Dicky. Holgate dropped  it inside his belt.    \"Full steam, and turn her nose to Cairo. No time to lose!\" He had told  Holgate earlier in the evening to keep up steam.    He could see a crowd slowly gathering under the palm-trees between the  shore and Beni Hassan. They were waiting for Mahommed Ibrahim's signal.    Holgate was below, the sailors were at the cables. \"Let go ropes!\" Dicky  called.    A minute later the engine was quietly churning away below; two minutes  later the ropes were drawn in; half a minute later still the nose of the  Amenhotep moved in the water. She backed from the Nile mud, lunged free.    \"An old man had three sons; one was a thief, another a rogue, and the  worst of the three was a soldier--and he dies first! What have you got  to say before you say your prayers?\" said Dicky to the Orderly.    \"Mafish!\" answered Mahommed Ibrahim, moveless. \"Mafish--nothing!\" And he  said \"nothing\" in good English.    \"Say your prayers then, Mahommed Ibrahim,\" said Dicky in that voice like  a girl's; and he backed a little till he rested a shoulder against the  binnacle.    Mahommed Ibrahim turned slightly till his face was towards the east. The  pistol now fell in range with his ear. The Orderly took off his shoes,  and, standing with his face towards the moon, and towards Mecca, he  murmured the fatihah from the Koran. Three times he bowed, afterwards he  knelt and touched the deck with his forehead three times also. Then he  stood up. \"Are you ready?\" asked Dicky.    \"Water!\" answered Mahommed Ibrahim in English. Dicky had forgotten that  final act of devotion of the good Mahommedan. There was a filter of  Nile-water near. He had heard it go drip-drip, drip-drip, as Mahommed  Ibrahim prayed.    \"Drink,\" he said, and pointed with his finger. Mahommed Ibrahim took  the little tin cup hanging by the tap, half filled it, drank it off, and  noiselessly put the cup back again. Then he stood with his face towards  the pistol.    \"The game is with the English all the time,\" said Dicky softly.    \"Malaish!\" said Mahommed. \"Jump,\" said Dicky.    One instant's pause, and then, without a sound, Ibrahim sprang out over  the railing into the hard-running current, and struck out for the shore.  The Amenhotep passed him. He was in the grasp of a whirlpool so strong  that it twisted the Amenhotep in her course. His head spun round like  a water-fly, and out of the range of Dicky's pistol he shrieked to the  crowd on the shore. They burst from the palm-trees and rushed down to  the banks with cries of rage, murder, and death; for now they saw him  fighting for his life. But the Amenhotep's nose was towards Cairo, and  steam was full on, and she was going fast. Holgate below had his men  within range of a pistol too. Dicky looked back at the hopeless fight as  long as he could see.    Down in his cabin Fielding Bey slept peacefully, and dreamed of a woman  in Cairo.          THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE    In spite of being an Englishman with an Irish name and a little Irish  blood, Dicky Donovan had risen high in the favour of the Khedive,  remaining still the same Dicky Donovan he had always been--astute but  incorruptible. While he was favourite he used his power wisely, and it  was a power which had life and death behind it. When therefore, one day,  he asked permission"]]]
