The pail was full of  water; the rope was tightly strained  over the top of the bed, and across  the windowsill to the tree outside.    \"It will make a great mess in my  bedroom; but I could never sleep in  that bed again without a spring  cleaning of some sort,\" said Mr.  Tod.      Mr. Tod took a last look at the  badger and softly left the room. He  went out of the house, shutting the  front door. The rabbits heard his  footsteps over the tunnel.    He ran round behind the house,  intending to undo the rope in order  to let fall the pailful of water upon  Tommy Brock--    \"I will wake him up with an  unpleasant surprise,\" said Mr. Tod.    The moment he had gone,  Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he  rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into  a bundle, put it into the bed beneath  the pail of water instead of  himself, and left the room also--  grinning immensely.    He went into the kitchen, lighted  the fire and boiled the kettle; for  the moment he did not trouble  himself to cook the baby rabbits.      When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he  found that the weight and strain  had dragged the knot so tight that  it was past untying. He was obliged  to gnaw it with his teeth. He  chewed and gnawed for more than  twenty minutes. At last the rope  gave way with such a sudden jerk  that it nearly pulled his teeth out,  and quite knocked him over backwards.    Inside the house there was a  great crash and splash, and the  noise of a pail rolling over and over.    But no screams. Mr. Tod was  mystified; he sat quite still, and  listened attentively. Then he peeped  in at the window. The water was  dripping from the bed, the pail had  rolled into a corner.    In the middle of the bed, under  the blanket, was a wet SOMETHING  --much flattened in the middle,  where the pail had caught it (as it  were across the tummy). Its head  was covered by the wet blanket,  and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.    There was nothing stirring, and  no sound except the drip, drop,  drop, drip, of water trickling from  the mattress.      Mr. Tod watched it for half an  hour; his eyes glistened.    Then he cut a caper, and became  so bold that he even tapped at the  window; but the bundle never  moved.    Yes--there was no doubt about  it--it had turned out even better  than he had planned; the pail had  hit poor old Tommy Brock, and  killed him dead!    \"I will bury that nasty person in  the hole which he has dug. I will  bring my bedding out, and dry it in  the sun,\" said Mr. Tod.    \"I will wash the tablecloth and  spread it on the grass in the sun to  bleach. And the blanket must be  hung up in the wind; and the bed  must be thoroughly disinfected,  and aired with a warming-pan;  and warmed with a hot water bottle.\"    \"I will get soft soap, and monkey  soap, and all sorts of soap; and  soda and scrubbing brushes; and  persian powder; and carbolic to  remove the smell. I must have a  disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to  burn sulphur.\"    He hurried round the house to  get a shovel from the kitchen--  \"First I will arrange the hole--then  I will drag out that person in the  blanket. . . .\"    He opened the door. . . .    Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr.  Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea  from Mr. Tod's teapot into Mr.  Tod's teacup. He was quite dry  himself and grinning; and he threw  the cup of scalding tea all over Mr.  Tod.    Then Mr. Tod rushed upon  Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock  grappled with Mr. Tod amongst  the broken crockery, and there  was a terrific battle all over the  kitchen. To the rabbits underneath  it sounded as if the floor would give  way at each crash of falling furniture.    They crept out of their tunnel,  and hung about amongst the rocks  and bushes, listening anxiously.    Inside the house the racket was  fearful. The rabbit babies in the  oven woke up trembling; perhaps it  was fortunate they were shut up inside.    Everything was upset except the  kitchen table.    And everything was broken,  except the mantelpiece and the  kitchen fender. The crockery was  smashed to atoms.    The chairs were broken, and the  window, and the clock fell with a  crash, and there were handfuls of  Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.    The vases fell off the mantelpiece,  the cannisters fell off the  shelf; the kettle fell off the hob.  Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar  of raspberry jam.      And the boiling water out of the  kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.    When the kettle fell, Tommy  Brock, who was still grinning,  happened to be uppermost; and he  rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a  log, out at the door.    Then the snarling and worrying  went on outside; and they rolled  over the bank, and down hill,  bumping over the rocks. There will  never be any love lost between  Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.    As soon as the coast was clear,  Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny  came out of the bushes.    \"Now for it! Run in, Cousin  Benjamin! Run in and get them! while  I watch the door.\"    But Benjamin was frightened--    \"Oh; oh! they are coming back!\"    \"No they are not.\"    \"Yes they are!\"    \"What dreadful bad language! I  think they have fallen down the  stone quarry.\"    Still Benjamin hesitated, and  Peter kept pushing him--    \"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the  oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so  that he won't miss them.\"    Decidedly there were lively  doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!    At home in the rabbit hole,  things had not been quite comfortable.    After quarreling at supper,  Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had  passed a sleepless night, and  quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr.  Bouncer could no longer deny that  he had invited company into the  rabbit hole; but he refused to reply  to the questions and reproaches of  Flopsy. The day passed heavily.    Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was  huddled up in a corner, barricaded  with a chair. Flopsy had taken  away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.  She had been having a complete  turn out and spring cleaning,  to relieve her feelings. She had just  finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind  his chair, was wondering anxiously  what she would do next.    In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the  wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked  his way to the oven nervously,  through a thick cloud of dust. He  opened the oven door, felt inside,  and found something warm and  wriggling. He lifted it out carefully,  and rejoined Peter Rabbit.    \"I've got them! Can we get away?  Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?\"    Peter pricked his ears; distant  sounds of fighting still echoed in  the wood.    Five minutes afterwards two  breathless rabbits came scuttering  away down Bull Banks, half carrying,  half dragging a sack between  them, bumpetty bump over the  grass. They reached home safely,  and burst into the rabbit hole.    Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief  and Flopsy's joy when Peter and  Benjamin arrived in triumph with  the young family. The rabbit babies  were rather tumbled and very hungry;  they were fed and put to bed.  They soon recovered.    A new long pipe and a fresh supply  of rabbit tobacco was presented  to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather  upon his dignity; but he accepted.    Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven,  and they all had dinner. Then Peter  and Benjamin told their story--but  they had not waited long enough to  be able to tell the end of the battle  between Tommy Brock and Mr.  Tod.          THE TALE OF  PIGLING BLAND    [For Cicily and Charlie,  a Tale of the Christmas Pig]          Once upon a time there was an  old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She  had eight of a family: four little girl  pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck,  Yock-yock and Spot; and four little  boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling  Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.  Stumpy had had an accident to his  tail.    The eight little pigs had very fine  appetites--\"Yus, yus, yus! they eat  and indeed they DO eat!\" said Aunt  Pettitoes, looking at her family  with pride. Suddenly there were  fearful squeals; Alexander had  squeezed inside the hoops of the  pig trough and stuck.      Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him  out by the hind legs.    Chin-chin was already in disgrace;  it was washing day, and he  had eaten a piece of soap. And  presently in a basket of clean  clothes, we found another dirty  little pig--\"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever  is this?\" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.  Now all the pig family are pink, or  pink with black spots, but this pig  child was smutty black all over;  when it had been popped into a  tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.    I went into the garden; there I  found Cross-patch and Suck-suck  rooting up carrots. I whipped them  myself and led them out by the  ears. Cross-patch tried to bite me.    \"Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes!  you are a worthy person, but your  family is not well brought up.  Every one of them has been in  mischief except Spot and Pigling  Bland.\"    \"Yus, yus!\" sighed Aunt Pettitoes.  \"And they drink bucketfuls of milk;  I shall have to get another cow!  Good little Spot shall stay at home  to do the housework; but the others  must go. Four little boy pigs and  four little girl pigs are too many  altogether.\" \"Yus, yus, yus,\" said  Aunt Pettitoes, \"there will be more  to eat without them.\"    So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went  away in a wheel-barrow, and  Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross-  patch rode away in a cart.    And the other two little boy pigs,  Pigling Bland and Alexander went  to market. We brushed their coats,  we curled their tails and washed  their little faces, and wished them  good bye in the yard.    Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes  with a large pocket handkerchief,  then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose  and shed tears; then she wiped  Alexander's nose and shed tears;  then she passed the handkerchief to  Spot. Aunt Pettitoes sighed and  grunted, and addressed those little  pigs as follows--    \"Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling  Bland, you must go to market. Take  your brother Alexander by the  hand. Mind your Sunday clothes,  and remember to blow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#14)"],[1,"it doesn't cost so much to live in Wayneboro,\" said Herbert.  \"We couldn't afford even one meal a day.\"    \"You haven't asked me what the doctor said,\" remarked Melville, as they  left the dining room.    \"Excuse me, Mr. Melville. It wasn't from any lack of interest.\"    \"He advises me to go West by the first of October, either to Colorado or  Southern California.\"    Herbert's countenance fell. The first of October would soon come, and  his pleasant and profitable engagement with Mr. Melville would close.    \"I am sorry,\" he said, gravely.    \"I am not so sorry as I should have been a few weeks ago,\" said  Melville. \"Then I should have looked forward to a journey as lonely and  monotonous. Now, with a companion, I think I may have a pleasant time.\"    \"Who is going with you, Mr. Melville?\" asked Herbert, feeling, it must  be confessed, a slight twinge of jealousy.    \"I thought perhaps you would be willing to accompany me,\" said Melville.    \"Would you really take me, Mr. Melville?\" cried Herbert, joyfully.    \"Yes, if you will go.\"    \"I should like nothing better. I have always wanted to travel. It quite  takes my breath away to think of going so far away.\"    \"I should hardly venture to go alone,\" continued George Melville. \"I  shall need some one to look after the details of the journey, and to  look after me if I fall sick. Do you think you would be willing to do  that?\"    \"I hope you won't fall sick, Mr. Melville; but if you do, I will take  the best care of you I know how.\"    \"I am sure you will, Herbert, and I would rather have you about me than  a man. Indeed, I already begin to think of you as a younger brother.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, gratefully. \"I am glad you do.\"    \"Do you think your mother will object to your leaving home, Herbert?\"    \"Not with you. She knows I shall be well provided for with you. Can I  arrange to send money regularly to mother?\" asked the boy. \"I shouldn't  like to think of her as suffering for want of it.\"    \"Yes, but to guard against emergencies, we can leave her a sum of money  before you start.\"    After dinner Mr. Melville proposed to Herbert to accompany him on a  walk up Washington Street, They walked slowly, Herbert using his eyes  diligently, for to him the display in the shop windows was novel and  attractive.    At length they paused at the door of a large and handsome jewelry  store--one of the two finest in Boston.    \"I want to go in here, Herbert,\" said his employer.    \"Shall I stay outside?\"    \"No, come in with me. You may like to look about.\"    Though Herbert had no idea of the cost of the fine stock with which the  store was provided, he saw that it must be valuable, and wondered where  purchasers enough could be found to justify keeping so large a supply  of watches, chains, rings and the numberless other articles in gold and  silver which he saw around him.    \"I would like to look at your watches,\" said Melville to the salesman  who came forward to inquire his wishes.    \"Gold or silver, sir?\"    \"Silver.\"    \"This way, if you please.\"    He led the way to a case where through the glass covering Herbert  saw dozens of silver watches of all sizes and grades lying ready for  inspection.    \"For what price can I get a fair silver watch?\" asked Melville.    \"Swiss or Waltham?\"    \"Waltham. I may as well patronize home manufactures.\"    \"Here is a watch I will sell you for fifteen dollars,\" said the  salesman, drawing out a neat-looking watch, of medium size. \"It will  keep excellent time, and give you good satisfaction.\"    \"Very well; I will buy it on your recommendation. Have you any silver  chains?\"    One was selected of pretty pattern, and George Melville paid for both.    \"How do you like the watch and chain, Herbert?\" said his employer, as  they left the store.    \"They are very pretty, sir.\"    \"I suppose you wonder what I want of two watches,\" said Melville.    \"Perhaps you don't like to take your gold watch with you when you go out  West, for fear of thieves.\"    \"No, that is not the reason. If I am so unfortunate as to lose my gold  watch, I will buy another. The fact is, I have bought this silver watch  and chain for you.\"    \"For me!\" exclaimed Herbert, intensely delighted.    \"Yes; it will be convenient for you, as well as me, to be provided with  a watch. Every traveler needs one. There; put it in your pocket, and see  how it looks.\"    \"You are very kind to me, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, gratefully. \"You  couldn't have bought me anything which I should value more.\"    When Herbert had arranged the watch and chain to suit him, it must be  confessed that it engrossed a large part of his attention, and it was  wonderful how often he had occasion to consult it during the first walk  after it came into his possession.          CHAPTER XVIII. A THIEF IN TROUBLE.        \"Have you ever visited the suburbs of Boston?\" asked Melville.    \"No,\" answered Herbert. \"I know very little of the city, and nothing of  the towns near it.\"    \"Then, as we have time to spare, we will board the next horse car and  ride out to Roxbury.\"    \"I should like it very much, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, in a tone  of satisfaction. I may remark that Roxbury was at that time a separate  municipality, and had not been annexed to Boston.    They did not have to wait long for a car. An open car, of the kind in  common use during the pleasant season, drew near, and they secured seats  in it. After leaving Dover Street, Washington Street, still then narrow,  broadens into a wide avenue, and is called the Neck. It was gay with  vehicles of all sorts, and Herbert found much to attract his attention.    \"The doctor tells me I ought to be a good deal in the open air,\" said  Melville, \"and I thought I would act at once upon his suggestion. It is  much pleasanter than taking medicine.\"    \"I should think so,\" answered Herbert, emphatically.    Arrived at the end of the route, Melville and Herbert remained on the  car, and returned at once to the city. When they reached the crowded  part of Washington Street a surprise awaited Herbert.    From a small jewelry store they saw a man come out, and walk rapidly  away.    \"Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, in excitement, \"do you see that man?\"    \"Yes. What of him?\"    \"It is the man who tried to rob me on Bunker Hill Monument.\"    He had hardly uttered these words when another man darted from the shop,  bareheaded, and pursued Herbert's morning acquaintance, crying, \"Stop,  thief!\"    The thief took to his heels, but a policeman was at hand, and seized him  by the collar.    \"What has this man been doing?\" he asked, as the jeweler's clerk came  up, panting.    \"He has stolen a diamond ring from the counter,\" answered the clerk. \"I  think he has a watch besides.\"    \"It's a lie!\" said the thief, boldly.    \"Search him!\" said the clerk, \"and you'll find that I have made no  mistake.\"    \"Come with me to the station house, and prepare your complaint,\" said  the policeman.    By this time a crowd had gathered, and the thief appealed to them.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I am a reputable citizen of St. Louis, come to  Boston to buy goods, and I protest against this outrage. It is either a  mistake or a conspiracy, I don't know which.\"    The thief was well dressed, and some of the bystanders were disposed to  put confidence in him. He had not seen Herbert and George Melville, who  had left the car and joined the throng, or he might not have spoken so  confidently.    \"He doesn't look like a thief,\" said one of the bystanders, a  benevolent-looking old gentleman.    \"I should say not,\" said the thief, more boldly. \"It's a pretty state  of things if a respectable merchant can't enter a store here in Boston  without being insulted and charged with theft. If I only had some of  my friends or acquaintances here, they would tell you that it is simply  ridiculous to make such a charge against me.\"    \"You can explain this at the station house,\" said the policeman. \"It is  my duty to take you there.\"    \"Is there no one who knows the gentleman?\" said the philanthropist  before referred to. \"Is there no one to speak up for him?\"    Herbert pressed forward, and said, quietly:    \"I know something of him; I passed the morning in his company.\"    The thief turned quickly, but he didn't seem gratified to see Herbert.    \"The boy is mistaken,\" he said, hurriedly; \"I never saw him before.\"    \"But I have seen you, sir,\" retorted our hero. \"You saw me draw some  money from a bank in State Street, scraped acquaintance with me, and  tried to rob me of it on Bunker Hill.\"    \"It's a lie!\" said the prisoner, hoarsely.    \"Do you wish to make a charge to that effect?\" asked the policeman.    \"No, sir; I only mentioned what I knew of him to support the charge of  this gentleman,\" indicating the jeweler's clerk.    The old gentleman appeared to lose his interest in the prisoner after  Herbert's statement, and he was escorted without further delay to the  station house, where a gold watch and the diamond ring were both found  on his person. It is scarcely needful to add that he was tried and  sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the very city--Charlestown--where  he had attempted to rob Herbert.    \"It is not always that retribution so quickly overtakes the wrongdoer,\"  said Melville. \"St. Louis will hardly be proud of the man who claims her  citizenship.\"    \"Dishonesty doesn't seem to pay in his case,\" said Herbert,  thoughtfully.    \"It never pays in any case, Herbert,\" said George Melville,  emphatically. \"Even if a man could steal enough to live upon, and were  sure not to be found out, he would not enjoy his ill-gotten gain, as an  honest man enjoys the money he works hard for. But when we add the risk  of detection and the severe penalty of imprisonment, it seems a fatal  mistake for any man to overstep the bounds of honesty and enroll himself  as a criminal.\"    \"I agree with you, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, thoughtfully. \"I don't"]]]
