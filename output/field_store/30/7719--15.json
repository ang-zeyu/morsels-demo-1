After  travelling for two hours farther over the plain, we halted, at ten hours  from Djidda, at Hadda, a souk, similar to the above. Between Bahhra and  Hadda, upon an insulated hillock in the plain, are the ruins of an  ancient fortification.    August 25th.--The caravan from Djidda to Mekka rests during the day at  Bahhra or at Hadda, thus following the common practice of the Hedjaz  Arabs, who travel only by night. This is done in winter as well as in  summer, not so much for the purpose of avoiding the heat as to afford  the camels time for feeding, these animals never eating by night. Such  nocturnal marches are most unfavourable to the researches of a  traveller, who thus crosses the country at a time when no objects can be  observed;    [p.55] and during the day, fatigue and the desire of sleep render every  exertion irksome.    We alighted at Hadda, under the shed of a spacious coffee-hut, where I  found a motley crew of Turks and Arabs, in their way to or from Mekka,  each extended upon his small carpet. Some merchants from Tayf had just  brought in a load of grapes; and, although I felt myself still weak from  the fever, I could not withstand this temptation, and seized a few of  them; for the baskets were no sooner opened than the whole company fell  upon them, and soon devoured the entire load; the owner, however, was  afterwards paid. It is at Hadda that the inhabitants of Djidda, when  making a pilgrimage to Mekka, put on the ihram, or pilgrims cloak. By  the Muselman law, every one is obliged to assume it, whatever may be his  rank, who enters the sacred territory of Mekka, whether on pilgrimage or  for other purposes; and he is enjoined not to lay it aside till after he  has visited the temple. Many persons, however, transgress this law; but  an o[r]thodox Mekkan never goes to Djidda without carrying his ihram with  him, and on his return home, he puts it on at this place. In the  afternoon some of the Turkish soldiers who were here put on this  garment, with the prescribed ceremonies, which consist in an ablution,  or, if the pilgrim choose, an entire purification, an audible avowal of  the act of investment, a prayer of two rikats, and the recital of pious  exclamations called telbye. This being a time of war, the soldiers  continued to wear their arms over the cloak.    In the afternoon, the coffee-house keeper dressed the provisions I had  brought, as well as those belonging to many others of the company. There  was great disorder in the place, and nobody could attempt to sleep. Soon  after our arrival, a troop of soldiers passed, and pitched their tents a  little farther on the plain; they then entered the coffee-huts, and took  away all the sweet water, which had been procured from a well about  half-an-hour distant, and kept at Hadda in large jars. The huts of the  few miserable    [p.56] inhabitants, thus exposed to all the casualties attending the  continual passage of troops, are formed with brushwood, in the shape of  a flattened cone, and they receive light only through the entrance; here  the whole family lives huddled together in one apartment. The numerous  coffee-huts are spacious sheds, supported by poles, with the coffee-  waiters hearth placed in one corner. They are infested by great numbers  of rats, bolder than any I ever saw.    We left Hadda about five oclock in the evening. The road continuing  over the plain, the soil is sandy, in some parts mixed with clay, and  might, I think, be easily cultivated by digging wells. At one hour from  Hadda, we saw on our left, in the plain, some date-trees: here, as I  understood, flows a small rivulet, which in former times irrigated some  fields. The trees are at present neglected. We now left the plain, and  diverging a little south-ward from our easterly course, again entered a  hilly country, and reached, at two hours from Hadda, another coffee-hut,  called Shemeysa. Behind it is the Djebel Shemeysa, or mountain of  Shemeysa, from which, according to the historians of Mekka, was  extracted the marble of many columns in the mosque of that holy city. In  the mountain, near the hut, is a well. From Shemeysa we rode in a broad  valley overspread with deep sands, and containing some thorny trees. At  four hours from Hadda, we passed Kahwet Salem, or Salems coffee-shop,  and a well; there we met a caravan coming from Mekka. The mountains  nearly close at this place, leaving only a narrow straight valley,  crossed at intervals by several other valleys. We then proceeded as far  as Hadjalye, a coffee-house, seven hours distant from Hadda, with a  large well near it, which supplies the camel-drivers of the Syrian  pilgrim caravan, on the way to and from Mekka.    Not having enjoyed a moments sleep since we quitted Djidda, I lay down  on the sands, and slept till day-break, while my companions pursued  their road to Mekka. My guide only remained with me;    [p.57] but his fears for the safety of his camels would not allow him to  close his eyes. The route from Djidda to Mekka is always frequented by  suspicious characters; and as every body travels by night, stragglers  are easily plundered. Near Hadjalye, are the ruins of an ancient  village, built with stone; and in the Wady are traces of former  cultivation.    August 26th.--At half an hour from Hadjalye, we came to a small date  plantation, surrounded by a wall. From hence the road to Mekka lies to  the right, and enters the town by the quarter called Djerouel. My guide  had orders to conduct me by a by-road to Tayf, which passes in the north  of Mekka; it branches off at Hadda, crosses the road from Mekka to Wady  Fatmé, and joins the great road from Mekka to Tayf, beyond Wady Muna.  Just before we left Hadda, my guide, who knew nothing further respecting  me than that I had business with the Pasha at Tayf, that I performed all  the outward observances of a Moslem pilgrim, and that I had been liberal  to him before our departure, asked me the reason of his having been  ordered to take me by the northern road. I replied, that it was probably  thought shorter than the other. That is a mistake, he replied; the  Mekka road is quite as short, and much safer; and if you have no  objection, we will proceed by it. This was just what I wished, though I  had taken care not to betray any anxiety on the subject; and we  accordingly followed the great road, in company with the other  travellers. Instead, however, of taking me the usual way, which would  have carried me through the whole length of the town, he, having no  curiosity to gratify, conducted me, without my being aware of it, by a  short cut, and thus deprived me of an opportunity of seeing Mekka fully  at this time.    From the date plantation beyond Hadjalye, we reached in half an hour the  plain where the Syrian pilgrim-caravan usually encamps, and which has  taken the name of Sheikh Mahmoud, from the tomb of a saint so called,  built in the midst of it. It is encompassed    [p.58] by low mountains; is from two to three miles in length, and one  in breadth; and is separated from the valley of Mekka by a narrow chain  of hills, over which a road has been cut through the rocks, with much  labour. By this road we ascended, and on the summit of the hill passed  two watch-towers, built on each side of the road by the Sherif Ghaleb.  As we descended on the other side, where the road is paved, the view of  Mekka opened upon us; and at an hour and a half from Hadjalye, we  entered the eastern quarter of the town, near the Sherifs palace  (marked 50 in the plan). The great body of the town lay on our right,  hidden, in part, by the windings of the valley. As I knew that I should  return to Mekka, I did not press my guide to allow me a full view of the  city, since we should, for that purpose, have been obliged to ride back  about two miles in a contrary direction. I repressed my curiosity,  therefore, and followed him, reciting those ejaculations which are  customary on entering the holy city.    I travelled several times afterwards between Mekka and Djidda, in both  directions. The caravans rate of march is here very slow, scarcely  exceeding two miles an hour. I have ridden from Mekka to Djidda upon an  ass in thirteen hours. The distance may, perhaps, be fairly estimated at  sixteen or seventeen hours walk, or about fifty-five miles; the  direction a trifle to the northward of east.    On turning to our left, we passed, a little farther on, the great  barracks of the Sherif; and in the suburbs called El Moabede, we  alighted at the house of an Arab, with whom my guide happened to be  acquainted. It was now the fast of Ramadhán; but travellers are exempted  by law from observing it. The woman of the house, whose husband was  absent, prepared us a breakfast, for which we paid her, and remained in  the house till after mid-day; we then remounted our camels, and turning  by the Sherifs garden-house, situated at the eastern extremity of the  suburbs, we took the high road to Wady Muna. Winding valleys, of greater  or less breadth,    [p.59] covered with sands, and almost wholly destitute of vegetation,  with hills on both sides, equally barren, lead to Muna. At half an hour  from the garden-house of the Sherif, the country opens a little to the  left. There the canal passes which supplies Mekka with sweet water; and  we saw, about two miles distant, at the extremity of the opening, a  conical mountain, called Djebel el Nour, considered holy by the  pilgrims, as will be subsequently mentioned. We passed on our right, in  an hour and a half, a large tank, built of stones. This, in the time of  the Hadj, is filled with water from the canal, which passes close by it.  I believe this to be the place called Sebyl-es-Sett. One of the side-  valleys between Mekka and Muna is called Wady Mohsab. El Fasy, the  historian of Mekka, says that there were formerly sixteen wells between  that city"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#14)"],[1,"but  better befriended boys.    So, when the examination--days came, the new Inspector, who came in  place of the lad's friend Chevalier de Keralio, decided that young  Napoleon Bonaparte was fitted for the artillery service; and at the age  of fifteen the boy left the school at Brienne, and was ordered to enter  upon a higher course of study at the military school at Paris. Nothing  more was said about preparing him for the naval service, for which  Inspector de Keralio had recommended him. And in the certificate  which he carried from Brienne to Paris, Napoleon was described as a  \"masterful, impetuous and headstrong boy.\" Evidently the opinion of  Napoleon's teachers was adopted, rather than the prophetic report of his  dead friend, Inspector de Keralio.    In after-years Napoleon forgot all the worries and troubles of his  school-days at Brienne, and remembered only the pleasant times there.    Once, when he was a man, he heard some bells chiming musically. He  stopped, listened, and said to his old schoolmate, whom he had made his  secretary,--    \"Ah, Bourrienne! that reminds me of my first years at Brienne; we were  happy there, were we not?\"    To the chaplain who had prepared him for that most important occasion in  the lives of all French children, his first communion, and who had taken  a fatherly interest in him, Napoleon, when powerful and great, wrote:  \"I can never forget that to your virtuous example and wise lessons I am  indebted for the great fortune that has come to me. Without religion, no  happiness, no future, is possible. My dear friend, remember me in your  prayers.\"    Even his old adversary, Bouquet, whose mean ways had brought Napoleon  into so many scrapes, was not forgotten. Bouquet was a bad fellow. Years  after, he was caught doing some great mischief; and Napoleon, as his  superior officer, would have been obliged to punish him. But when he  heard that Bouquet had escaped from prison, he really felt relieved.    \"Bouquet was my old schoolfellow at Brienne,\" he said. \"I am glad I did  not have to punish him.\"    Whenever he had the chance, after he had risen to honor and power, he  would do his old schoolmates and teachers at Brienne school a service.  Bourrienne and Lauriston were both advanced and honored. To one teacher  he gave the post of palace librarian; another was appointed the head of  the School of Fine Arts; Father Patrault, who had been his friend and  had taught him mathematics, was made one of his secretaries; other  teachers he helped with pensions or positions; and even the porter of  the school was made porter of one of the palaces when Napoleon became an  emperor.    At last, as I have told you, when the opportunity came, Napoleon said  good-by to Brienne school. He left before his time was up, in order to  give his younger brother, Lucien, the chance for a scholarship in  the school; he put aside with regret, but without complaining, the  wished-for assignment to the naval service. He decided to become an  artillery officer; and on October 17, in the year 1784, he started for  Paris to enter upon his \"king's scholarship\" in the military school. He  had been a schoolboy at Brienne five years and a half. He was now a boy  of fifteen.          CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    NAPOLEON GOES TO PARIS.    Some boys at fifteen are older than other boys at fifteen. Napoleon, as  I have told you, was always an \"old boy.\" So when, on that October day  in 1784, he arrived at the capital to enter upon the king's scholarship  which he had received, he was no longer a child, even though under-sized  and somewhat \"spindling.\"    Here, however, as at Autun and Brienne, his appearance was against him,  and created an unfavorable impression.    As he got out of the Brienne coach, he ran almost into the arms of one  of the boys he had known at Corsica--young Demetrius Compeno.    \"What, Demetrius! you here?\" he cried, a smile of pleasure at sight of a  familiar face lighting up his sallow features.    \"And why not, young Bonaparte,\" Demetrius laughed back in reply. \"You  did not suppose I was going to let you fall right into the lion's mouth,  undefended. Why, you are so fresh and green looking, the beast would  take you for Corsican grass, and eat you at once.\"    Although Napoleon was inclined to resent this pleasantry, he was too  delighted to meet an old friend to say much. And, the truth is, the  great city did surprise him. For, even though he had been five years  at Brienne school, he was still a country boy, and walked the streets  gaping and staring at everything he saw, like a boy at his first circus.    \"Why, boy! if I were not with you,\" said Demetrius, with the superior  air of the boy who knows city ways, \"I don't know what snare you would  not fall into. While you were staring at the City Hall, or the Soldier's  Home, or that big statue of King Henry on the bridge, one of those  street-boys who is laughing at you yonder would have picked your  pockets, snatched your satchel, or perhaps (who knows?) cut your throat.  Oh, yes! they do such things in Paris. You must learn to look out for  yourself here.\"    \"I think I am big enough for that,\" cried Napoleon.    \"You big! why, you are but a child, young Bonaparte!\" Demetrius  exclaimed. \"But we'll make a man of you at the Paris school.\"    The boys at the Paris Military School--the West Point of France in those  days--proceeded at once to try to \"make a man\" of Napoleon in the same  way that all boys seem ever ready to do; as, indeed, the boys at Autun  and Brienne had done--by poking fun at the new cadet, mimicking  his manners, ridiculing his appearance, and making life generally  unpleasant.    But Napoleon had learned one thing by his bitter experiences at the  other schools he had attended,--he had learned to control his temper,  and take things as they came, with less of revenge and sullenness.  The kindly criticism of his friends, General Marbeuf and Inspector de  Keralio, had left their effect upon him; and besides the companionship  of his fellow-countryman, Demetrius Comneno, he had the good fortune to  make his first really boy-friend in his roommate at the military school.  This was young Alexander des Mazes, a fine lad of his own age, \"a noble  by birth and nature,\" who conceived a liking for Napoleon at once, and  was his friend for many years.    In Paris, too, he had the advantage of the friendship of a fine Corsican  family,--the Permous, relatives of Demetrius, and old acquaintances of  the Bonaparte family. His sister Eliza was also at school at the girls'  academy of St. Cyr; and Napoleon visited her frequently, and talked over  home matters and other mutual interests. For Napoleon had long since  forgiven and forgotten the trouble into which Eliza had once plunged him  because of her love for the fruit of their uncle, the canon; and the  brother and sister could now laugh over that childish experience, while  Eliza dearly loved Napoleon, in spite of her selfishness, and even  because of his so uncomplainingly bearing her punishment.    Napoleon, though \"an odd child,\" as people called him, was wide awake  and critical. He observed everything, and thought much. He was not long  in noticing one thing: that was, the recklessness, the extravagance, and  the indifference of the boys who were being educated at the king's  expense in the king's military school.    Most of these boys were of high birth, accustomed to having their own  way, and with extravagant tastes and notions. Napoleon spoke of this  frequently to the friends he made; but both Demetrius and Alexander  laughed at him, and said, \"Well, what of it? Would you have us all digs  and hermits--like you? Here is the chance to have a good time, to live  high, and to let the king pay for it--the king or our fathers. Why  shouldn't we do as we please?\"    \"But, Demetrius!\" Napoleon protested, \"that is not the way to make  soldiers. Do you think those fellows will be good officers, if they  never know what it is to deny themselves, or to do the work that is  their duty, but which they leave for servants to do?\" For Napoleon, you  see, had many of the saving ways of his practical mother, and rebelled  at the unconcern of these luxury-loving and careless boys, who were  supposed to be learning the discipline of soldiers in their Paris  school.    Demetrius only snapped his fingers, as Alexander shrugged his shoulders,  in contempt of what they considered Napoleon's countrified way.    But all this show of pomp and luxury really troubled this boy, who had  long before learned the value of money and the need of self-denial.  Indeed, it worried him so much that one day he sat down and wrote a  letter which he intended to send as a protest to the minister of war,  actually lecturing that high and mighty officer, and \"giving him points\"  on the proper way to educate boys in the French military schools.    Fortunately for him, he sent the letter first to his old instructor, the  principal of the Brienne school. And the instructor--even though he,  perhaps, agreed with this boy-critic--saw how foolish and hurtful for  Napoleon's interest it would be to send such a surprising letter; and  he promptly suppressed it. But the letter still exists; and a curious  epistle it is for a fifteen-year-old boy to write. Here is a part of it:    \"The king's scholars,\" so Napoleon wrote to the minister, \"could only  learn in this school, in place of qualities of the heart, feelings of  vanity and self-satisfaction to such an extent, that, on returning to  their own homes, they would be far from sharing gladly in the simple  comfort of their families, and would perhaps blush for their fathers  and mothers, and despise their modest country surroundings. Instead of  maintaining a large staff of servants for these pupils, and giving them  every day meals of several courses, and keeping up an expensive stable  full of horses and grooms, would it not be better, Mr. Minister--of"]]]
