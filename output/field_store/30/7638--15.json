I appreciate the extreme delicacy  of the situation and you must observe the necessity of a man handling  this affair.\"    She shook her head and tapped the letters nervously.    \"No.  It is intolerable,\" she said.  \"Not to be thought of.\"    I saw that I had to make it stronger.  I thereupon invented the most  ingenious lies it has ever been given me to tell.  In about five  minutes I had painted the young Grand Duke in such colors that the  adventures of Don Juan were saintly compared to the escapades of his  ducal highness.    \"Why, consider it yourself,\" I said.  \"He was to be over here with you  during the season.  He has not come.  You told me yourself that he has  not even answered your letters.  Well, that's all there is to it.  Your ladyship, he and his house deserve any punishment that you can  visit upon them.\"    The idea of punishment appealed where the other had failed.  The  outraged pride of woman, especially an Englishwoman, is a terrible  thing.  Soon after that I made haste to take my leave.  At my quarters  I wrote two letters to myself and signed the Grand Duke's name to  them.  In these I offered to pay her ladyship's debts.  They were  addressed to me and after allowing a reasonable time to elapse, I  again went out to Mayfair and read them to her.  She was now cold and  hard and gave me full permission to go ahead and make any arrangements  I deemed advisable.  I thereupon went to the Grand Duke's bank in  London and notified them that I must have 15,000 pounds ($75,000).  In  four days I had the money.  The rest of the transaction was  commonplace.  She handed over all the letters and documents and I gave  her the 15,000 pounds.  I know to-day that her ladyship travels  extensively in a very comfortable manner on the yearly appanage  allowed her by the old Grand Duke.  I do not know whether she still  goes to Carlton Terrace to eat strawberries, but I flatter myself that  her present good fortune is partially due to the fact that she once  went there.    At the time of closing our little transaction, she took the precaution  to protect adequately and seal all letters and documents from my  perusal.  Of course that was a disappointment.  I put the packet away  carefully, closed up my aftairs in London and went back to Germany,  going direct to Mecklenburg-Schwerein where I delivered the package to  the old Grand Duke in person.  He seized it eagerly and opened it in  my presence.  I noticed as he ran through the letters that he did not  stop even to glance at them.  He did, however, stop and pick out from  the pile an official looking document, at the sight of which a  tremendous sigh of relief seemed to escape him.  The document had a  decidedly close resemblance to a marriage license as issued in  Switzerland.  Of course I only got a fleeting, cursory glance at it,  but the eagerness of the Grand Duke in pouncing upon that one document  and ignoring the letters, and hints previously dropped by her  ladyship, embellished by rumors I later heard in Switzerland, all  leave very little doubt in my mind that a clandestine marriage did  actually take place between this lady of the English nobility and the  young Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerein.    His Royal Highness must have been satisfied, for besides a fee of 5000  marks, I received a few days later through Wedel a diamond pin and a  magnficent gold watch and chain inscribed with the Grand Ducal arms of  Mecklenburg-Schwerein inscribed:    \"For services performed faithfully to my house.\"      Chapter VI. The Intrigue at Monte Carlo    Back in Berlin from a mission to Vienna, my dispatches delivered, once  more comfortably ensconced in my quarters, on the Mittelstrasse, I was  looking forward to an evening at the Pavilion Mascotte.  I was just  getting into my dinner coat when my man bowed an orderly through the  door and at once all my plans took swift flight out the window.  The  orderly brought a command for my immediate attendance at the  Wilhelmstrasse.  Now the gentlemen of the Wilhelmstrasse are never  kept waiting and do not accept excuses.  Within twenty minutes I was  shown into the chambers of Count von Wedel; in thirty minutes I was  out again, having complete orders.  They know what they want at the  Wilhelmstrasse and they generally get it.    As I hurried back to my rooms I went over what von Wedel had said:    \"You are to be ready to take the midnight express to Monte Carlo.  You  will there keep watch on and report any possible meeting between the  Russian, French and English ministers, at present traveling about the  Riviera.  You will have the assistance, if necessary, of the Countess  Chechany.  If you need her, send her this card\" (he had given me the  card with his signature across it, a reproduction of which is  presented on this page).\"  If meetings or conferences take place, you  must obtain the tenor thereof.  Here is an order for your primary  expenses.\"  He had flicked an order for 3000 marks, about $750, across  his desk.  \"Anything you wish elucidated?\"    Not having met the Countess, I had requested her description.  Pushing  a button, Count von Wedel had given the answering secretary an order;  within three minutes I was shown the photograph of the lady and her  signature, of which I took a copy.  Having no further requests I had  bowed myself out.    My first act was to cash the order; second to decide and prepare the  character I wished to assume in Monte Carlo.  I decided on a South  African mine owner.  I know considerable about mining, and being well  acquainted with South Africa, the Rand and Transvaal, I had the  advantage of knowing my locality first.  A Secret Service agent is  always careful to choose a character with which he is fully familiar.  One is certain to meet, sooner or later, men in the same walk of life;  and unless one be well primed, one is bound to be \"bowled out.\"  I  knew there would be South African mining men at Monte Carlo.    Procuring necessary papers, such as mining journals, quotations, a  couple of South African newspapers and photographs, I went home and  had my man carefully select and pack my wardrobe.  I caught the  midnight Lloyd Express.  Selecting a pleasant middle compartment, and  getting my seat registered, I made myself comfortable and began to map  out a campaign.  This was rather a tough problem.  To be in the  slightest degree successful, I had to get near, and if possible in  touch with the ministers that Count von Wedel had designated.  How is  this to be done?  I knew it was far from easy, almost impossible, to  make their casual acquaintance.    I began to cast the personality of the three men over in my mind.  There was Prince Kassimir Galitzin, at that time high in the favor of  the Czar.  There were Delcasse of France and Sir Edward Grey of  England.  All three were gyrating about the Riviera and the  Savoy--ostensibly it was for their health, possibly for other reasons.  In any case the health of these gentlemen seemed a matter of some  concern to the German emperor.  Health trips of more than one  statesman in or about the same locality are looked upon with much  suspicion and promptly investigated; more so when there is any extra  political tension.  At that time--it was in 1910--the air was tense,  Germany was in the dark, unable to distinguish friend or foe.    Sir Edward Grey's habits were unknown to me.  With Delcasse's I was  somewhat familiar.  Prince Galitzin--ah, yes!  I knew him pretty well,  _bon vivaint_, extremely fond of a pretty face.  Um!  I began to see  light.  Here is where the Countess might come in.  By her photograph,  an extremely beautiful woman; but photographs often flatter and do not  give an indication as to personality.  _Festina lente.  I could see.    Five forty-five the next afternoon and I was installed at the Hotel  Metropole in Monte Carlo.  After a refreshing bath, I had supper  served in my room, and sent for the hotel courier--this an old  globe-trotter trick.  Hotel couriers or dragomen are walking  encylopÃ¦dias.  They are good linguists, observant and shrewd.  They  are masters of the art of finding out things they should not know, and  past grand masters in keeping their mouths shut unless you know how to  open them.  Not with palm oil.  Oh, no, nothing so crude!  You would  never get any truths or anything worth while, with bribery.    I had to find out local intrigues and gossips, who was in Monte Carlo  and what was doing, who were the leading demi-mondaines and gamblers?  Were there any possible Secret Service men?  Hence the courier, a  Swiss from Ober Arau, a district of Switzerland, I luckily knew well.  When he knocked at the door, I cheerily bade him come in.  I made my  manner as good natured as possible.  I offered him a real Medijeh  cigarette.  As befitting his station, he was slipping the cigarette in  his pocket.    \"Oh, no!\" I said.  \"Light it, won't you?  Have a little smoke with me  here.  I'm a bit lonesome.  I want to get my bearings.  Won't you join  me in a glass of wine?\"    That was my first oar in.  After some commonplace conversation, as to  how the season was, I asked:    \"Anybody of interest here?\"    I winked knowingly.  Possibly it pleased the courier to have someone  to chuckle over a secret.  All my oars were in.    \"At the Grand Hotel de Londres,\" he said slyly, \"there is a gentleman  who does not fool me.\"    I offered him another cigarette, helped him to another glass of wine.    \"He is registered there as Count Techlow, but he can't fool me.  He is  the Prince Galitzin.\"    \"What's he doing; gambling a lot?\" (I knew he wasn't.)    \"No,\" replied the courier, \"he's keeping pretty quiet.\"    \"Is there a Countess Techlow?\"    The courier shook his head.  _Buenno!_ The coast seemed clear.  I knew  it was extremely awkward and often dangerous to tempt the quarry away "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#14)"],[1," go down with you to the wharf, and will do what I can  to hasten the sailing of your ship. I don't think,\" he went on, when  they had taken their seats at table, \"that there is much chance  of her meeting another Spaniard on her way out to sea, for we have  news this morning that some ships of the beggars have been seen  cruising off the entrance, and the Spaniards will be getting under  shelter of their batteries at Amsterdam. I hear they are expecting  a fleet from Spain to arrive soon to aid in their operations against  our ports. However, I have little fear that they will do much by  sea against us. I would we could hold our own as well on the land  as we can on the water.\"    Ned found the meal extremely long and tedious, for he was fretting  to be off to hasten the preparations on board the Good Venture,  and he was delighted when at last the burgomaster said:    \"Now, my young friend, we will go down to the wharf together.\"    But although somewhat deliberate, the burgomaster proved a valuable  assistant. When he had told Ned that he would do what he could to  expedite the sailing of the ship, the lad had regarded it as a mere  form of words, for he did not see how he could in any way expedite  her sailing. As soon, however, as they had gone on board, and  Ned had told Peters that the captain had given his consent to his  sailing at once, the burgomaster said: \"You can scarce set sail  before the tide turns, Master Peters, for the wind is so light that  you would make but little progress if you did. From what Master  Martin tells me you came off so hurriedly from Amsterdam that you  had no time to get ballast on board. It would be very venturesome  to start for a voyage to England unless with something in your  hold. I will give orders that you shall be furnished at once with  sandbags, otherwise you would have to wait your turn with the other  vessels lying here; for ballast is, as you know, a rare commodity  in Holland, and we do not like parting even with our sand hills.  In the meantime, as you have well nigh six hours before you get  under way, I will go round among my friends and see if I cannot  procure you a little cargo that may pay some of the expenses of  your voyage.\"    Accordingly the burgomaster proceeded at once to visit several of  the principal merchants, and, representing that it was the clear  duty of the townsfolk to do what they could for the men who had  fought so bravely against the Spaniards, he succeeded in obtaining  from them a considerable quantity of freight upon good terms; and  so zealously did he push the business that in a very short time  drays began to arrive alongside the Good Venture, and a number of  men were speedily at work in transferring the contents to her hold,  and before evening she had taken on board a goodly amount of cargo.    Ned wrote a letter to his mother telling her what had taken place,  and saying that his father would be glad for her to come over to  be with him, but that he left it to her to decide whether to bring  the girls over or not. He said no word of the events at Vordwyk;  but merely mentioned they had learned that a spy had denounced his  father to the Spaniards as having used expressions hostile to the  king and the religious persecutions, and that on this account he  would have been arrested had he not at once put to sea. Peters was  charged to say nothing as to what he had heard about the Plomaerts  unless she pressed him with questions. He was to report briefly  that they were so busy with the unloading of the ship at Amsterdam  that Captain Martin had only once been ashore, and leave it to be  inferred that he only landed to see the merchants to whom the cargo  was consigned.    \"Of course, Peters, if my mother presses you as to whether any  news has been received from Vordwyk, you must tell the truth; but  if it can be concealed from her it will be much the best. She will  have anxiety enough concerning my father.\"    \"I will see,\" Peters said, \"what can be done. Doubtless at first  she will be so filled with the thought of your father's danger  that she will not think much of anything else; but on the voyage  she will have time to turn her thoughts in other directions, and she  is well nigh sure to ask about her father and brothers. I shall be  guided in my answers by her condition. Mistress Martin is a sensible  woman, and not a girl who will fly into hysterics and rave like a  madwoman.    \"It may be too, she will feel the one blow less for being so taken  up with the other; however, I will do the best I can in the matter,  Master Ned. Truly your friend the burgomaster is doing us right  good service. I had looked to lose this voyage to England, and that  the ten days I should be away would be fairly lost time; but now,  although we shall not have a full hold, the freight will be ample  to pay all expenses and to leave a good profit beside.\"    As soon as the tide turned the hatches were put on, the vessel was  warped out from her berth, and a few minutes later was under sail.    Ned had been busy helping to stow away the cargo as fast as it  came on board, twice running up to see how his father was getting  on. Each time he was told by the woman whom the burgomaster had  now engaged to act as nurse, that he was sleeping quietly. When he  returned after seeing the Good Venture fairly under way, he found  on peeping quietly into the room that Captain Martin had just woke.    \"I have had a nice sleep, Ned,\" he said, as the lad went up to his  bedside. \"I see it is already getting dark. Has the brig sailed?\"    \"She has just gone out of port, father. The wind is light and it  was no use starting until tide turned; although, indeed, the tides  are of no great account in these inland waters. Still, we had to  take some ballast on board as our hold was empty, and they might  meet with storms on their way home; so they had to wait for that.  But, indeed, after all, they took in but little ballast, for the  burgomaster bestirred himself so warmly in our favour that the  merchants sent down goods as fast as we could get them on board,  and short as the time was, the main hold was well nigh half full  before we put on the hatches; so that her voyage home will not be  without a good profit after all.\"    \"That is good news, Ned; for although as far as I am concerned the  money is of no great consequence one way or the other, I am but  part owner, and the others might well complain at my sending the  ship home empty to fetch my wife instead of attending to their  interests.\"    \"I am sure they would not have done that, father, seeing how well  you do for them, and what good money the Venture earns. Why, I  have heard you say she returns her value every two years. So that  they might well have gone without a fortnight's earnings without  murmuring.\"    \"I don't suppose they would have murmured, Ned, for they are all  good friends of mine, and always seem well pleased with what I do  for them. Still, in matters of business it is always well to be  strict and regular; and I should have deemed it my duty to have  calculated the usual earnings of the ship for the time she was  away, and to have paid my partners their share as if she had been  trading as usual. It is not because the ship is half mine and that  I and my partners make good profit out of her, that I have a right  to divert her from her trade for my own purposes. As you say, my  partners might be well content to let me do so; but that is not  the question, I should not be content myself.    \"We should always in business work with a good conscience, being  more particular about the interests of those who trust us than of  our own. Indeed, on the bare ground of expediency it is best to do  so; for then, if misfortune happens, trade goes bad, or your vessel  is cast away, they will make good allowance for you, knowing that  you are a loser as well as they, and that at all times you have  thought as much of them as of yourself. Lay this always to heart,  lad. It is unlikely that I shall go to sea much more, and ere long  you will be in command of the Good Venture. Always think more of  the interests of those who trust you than of your own.    \"They have put their money into the ship, relying upon their  partner's skill and honesty and courage. Even at a loss to yourself  you should show them always that this confidence is not misplaced.  Do your duty and a little more, lad. Most men do their duty. It is  the little more that makes the difference between one man and the  other. I have tried always to do a little more, and I have found  my benefit from it in the confidence and trust of my partners in  the ship, and of the merchants with whom I do business. However, I  am right glad that the ship is not going back empty. I shall reckon  how much we should have received for the freight that was promised  me at Amsterdam, then you will give me an account of what is to be  paid by the merchants here. The difference I shall make up, as is  only right, seeing that it is entirely from my own imprudence in  expressing my opinion upon affairs particular to myself, and in  no way connected with the ship, that I was forced to leave without  taking in that cargo.\"    Ned listened in silence to his father's words, and resolved to  lay to heart the lessons they conveyed. He was proud of the high  standing and estimation in which his father was held by all who  knew him, and he now recognized fully for the first time how he  had won that estimation. It was not only that he was a good sailor,  but that in all things men were assured that his honour could  be implicitly relied upon, and that he placed the interest of his  employers beyond his own.    After the first day or two Ned could see but little change in his  father's condition; he was very weak and low, and spoke but seldom.  Doubtless his bodily condition was aggravated now by the thought  that must be ever present to him--that his active"]]]
