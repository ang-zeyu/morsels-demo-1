Why 'evening' is difficult to understand,  for all my life this moth occurs more frequently with me in the fore  and early afternoon than in the evening.  So I agree with those  entomologists who call it the 'white-lined morning-sphinx.'  It is lovely in modest garb, delicately lined, but exceedingly  rich in colour.  It has the long slender wings of the Sphingid  moths, and in grace and tirelessness of flight resembles Celeus,  the swallow of the moth family.    Its head is very small, and its thorax large.  The eyes are big,  and appear bigger because set in so tiny a head.  Under its  tongue, which is a full inch long, is a small white spot that  divides, spreads across each eye, and runs over the back until even  with the bases of the front wings.  The top of the head and shoulders  are olive brown, decorated with one long white line dividing it in  the middle, and a shorter on each side.  The abdomen is a pale brown,  has a straight line running down the middle of the back, made up of  small broken squares of very dark brown, touched with a tiny mark  of white.  Down each side of this small line extends a larger one,  wider at the top and tapering, and this is composed of squares of  blackish brown alternating with white, the brown being twice the  size of the white.  The sides of the abdomen are flushed with  beautiful rosy  pink, and beneath it is tan colour.    The wings are works of art.  The front are a rich olive brown, marked  the long way in the middle by a wide band of buff, shading to lighter  buff at the base.  They are edged from the costa to where they meet  the back wings, with a line of almost equal width of darker buff,  the lower edge touched with white.  Beginning at the base, and running  an equal distance apart from the costa to this line, are fine markings  of white, even and clear as if laid on with a ruler.    The surprise comes in the back wings, that show almost entirely  when the moth is poised before a flower.  These have a small  triangle of the rich dark brown, and a band of the same at the  lower edge, with a finish of olive, and a fine line of white as a  marginal decoration.  Crossing each back wing is a broad band of  lovely pink of deeper shade than the colour on the sides.  This  pink, combined with the olive, dark browns, and white lining,  makes the colour scheme of peculiar richness.    Its antennae are long, clubbed, and touched with white at the tips.  The legs and body are tan colour.  The undersides of the wings are  the same as the upper, but the markings of brown and buffish pink  show through in lighter colour, while the white lining resembles  rows of tan ridges beneath.  Its body is covered with silky hairs,  longest on the shoulders, and at the base of the wings.    The eggs of the moth are laid on apple, plum, or woodbine leaves,  or on grape, currant, gooseberry, chickweed or dock.  During May  and June around old log cabins in the country, with gardens that  contain many of these vines and bushes, and orchards of bloom  where the others can be found the Lined Evening Lover deposits her  eggs.    The caterpillars emerge in about six days.  The tiny ovoid eggs  are a greenish yellow.  The youngsters are pale green, and have  small horns.  After a month spent in eating, and skin casting, the  full-grown caterpillar is over two inches long, and as a rule a  light green.  There are on each segment black patches, that have a  touch of orange, and on that a hint of yellow.  The horn increases  with the growth of the caterpillar, can be moved at will, and seems  as if it were a vicious 'stinger.'  But there is no sting, or any  other method of self-defence, unless the habit of raising the head  and throwing it from side to side could be so considered.  With many  people, this movement, combined with the sharp horn, is enough, but  as is true of most caterpillars, they are perfectly harmless.  Some  moth historians record a mustard yellow caterpillar of this family,  and I remember having seen some that answer the description; but all  I ever have known to be Lineata were green.    The pupae are nearly two inches long and are tan coloured.  They  usually are found in the ground in freedom, or deep under old logs  among a mass of leaves spun together.  In captivity the caterpillars  seem to thrive best on a diet of purslane, and they pupate perfectly  on dry sand in boxes.    These moths have more complete internal development than those of  night, for they feed and live throughout the summer.  I photographed  a free one feasting on the sweets of petunias in a flower bed at the  Cabin, on the seventh of October.        CHAPTER VI  Moths of the Moon:  Actias Luna      One morning there was a tap at my door, and when I opened it I  found a tall, slender woman having big, soft brown eyes, and a  winning smile.  In one hand she held a shoe-box, having many rough  perforations.  I always have been glad that my eyes softened at  the touch of pleading on her face, and a smile sprang in answer  to hers before I saw what she carried.  For confession must be  made that a perforated box is a passport to my good graces any day.    The most wonderful things come from those that are brought to my  front door.  Sometimes they contain a belated hummingbird, chilled  with the first heavy frost of autumn, or a wounded weasel caught  in a trap set for it near a chicken coop, or a family  of baby  birds whose parents some vandal has killed.  Again they carry a  sick or wounded bird that I am expected to doctor; and butterflies,  moths, insects, and caterpillars of every description.    \"I guess I won't stop,\"  said the woman in answer to my invitation  to enter the Cabin.  \"I found this creature on my front porch  early this morning, and I sort of wanted to know what it was, for  one thing, and I thought you might like to have it, for another.\"    \"Then of course you will come in, and we will see what it is,\" I  answered, leading the way into the library.    There I lifted the lid slightly  to take a peep, and then with a  cry  of joy, opened it wide.  That particular shoe-box had brought  me an Actias Luna, newly emerged, and as yet unable to fly.  I held  down my  finger, it climbed on, and was lifted to the light.    \"Ain't it the prettiest thing?\"  asked the woman, with stars  sparkling in her dark eyes.  \"Did you ever see whiter white?\"    Together we studied that moth.  Clinging to my finger, the living  creature was of such delicate beauty as to impoverish my stock of  adjectives at the beginning.  Its big, pursy body was covered  with long, furry scales of the purest white imaginable.  The wings  were of an exquisite light green colour; the front pair having a  heavy costa of light purple that reached across the back of the head:  the back pair ended in long artistic 'trailers,' faintly edged with  light yellow.  The front wing had an oval transparent mark close the  costa, attached to it with a purple line, and the back had circles  of the same.  These decorations were bordered with lines of white,  black, and red.  At the bases of the wings were long, snowy silken  hairs; the legs were purple, and the antennae resembled small,  tan-coloured ferns.  That is the best I can do at description.  A  living moth must be seen to form a realizing sense of its shape and  delicacy of colour.  Luna is our only large moth having trailers,  and these are much longer in proportion to size and of more graceful  curves than our trailed butterflies.    The moth's wings were fully expanded, and it was beginning to  exercise, so a camera was set up hastily, and several pictures of  it secured.  The woman helped me through the entire process, and  in talking with her, I learned that she was Mrs. McCollum, from  a village a mile and a half north of ours; that when she reached  home she would have walked three miles to make the trip; and  all her neighbours had advised her not to come, but she \"had a  feeling that she would like to.\"    \"Are you sorry?\" I asked.    \"Am I sorry!\" she cried.  \"Why I never had a better time in my  life, and I can teach the children what you have told me.  I'll  bring you everything I can get my fingers on that you can use,  and send for you when I find bird nests.\"    Mrs. McCollum has kept that promise faithfully.  Again and again  she trudged those three miles, bringing me small specimens of many  species or to let me know that she had found a nest.    A big oak tree in Mrs. McCollum's yard explained the presence of  a Luna there, as the caterpillars of this specie greatly prefer  these leaves.  Because the oak is of such slow growth it is seldom  planted around residences for ornamental purposes; but is to be  found most frequently in the forest.  For this reason Luna as a  rule is a moth of the deep wood, and so is seldom seen close a  residence, making people believe it quite rare.  As a matter of  fact, it is as numerous where the trees its caterpillars  frequent are to be found, as any  other moth in its natural  location.  Because it is of the forest, the brightest light there  is to attract it is the glare of the moon as it is reflected on  the face of a murky pool, or on the breast of the stream rippling  its way through impassable thickets.  There must be a self-satisfied  smile on the face of the man in the moon, in whose honour these  delicate creatures are named, when on fragile wing they hover above  his mirrored reflection; for of all the beauties of a June night  in the forest, these moths are most truly his.    In August of the same year, while driving on a corduroy road in  Michigan, I espied a Luna moth on the trunk of a walnut tree close  the road.  The cold damp location must account for this late  emergence; for subsequent events proved that others of the family  were as slow in appearing.  A storm of protest arose, when I stopped  the carriage and started to enter the swamp.  The remaining occupants  put"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#14)"],[1,"fanned their cheeks with the  air it so rapidly divided. Suddenly, however, the fire from the  batteries was discontinued, and this he knew to be a signal for  himself. He gave an order in a low voice, and the detachment quitted  their recumbent and defensive position, still remaining formed in  square. At the same instant, a gun flashed from the fort; but not as  before was heard the rushing sound of the destructive shot crushing the  trees in its resistless course. The Indians took courage at this  circumstance, for they deemed the bullets of their enemies were  expended; and that they were merely discharging their powder to keep up  the apprehension originally produced. Again they showed themselves,  like so many demons, from behind their lurking places; and yells and  shouts of the most terrific and threatening character once more rent  the air, and echoed through the woods. Their cries of anticipated  triumph were, however, but of short duration. Presently, a hissing  noise was heard in the air; and close to the bomb-proof, and at the  very skirt of the forest, they beheld a huge globe of iron fall  perpendicularly to the earth, to the outer part of which was attached  what they supposed to be a reed, that spat forth innumerable sparks of  fire, without however, seeming to threaten the slightest injury.  Attracted by the novel sight, a dozen warriors sprang to the spot, and  fastened their gaze upon it with all the childish wonder and curiosity  of men in a savage state. One, more eager and restless than his  fellows, stooped over it to feel with his hand of what it was composed.  At that moment it burst, and limbs, and head, and entrails, were seen  flying in the air, with the fragments of the shell, and prostrate and  struggling forms lay writhing on every hand in the last, fierce agonies  of death.    A yell of despair and a shout of triumph burst at the same moment from  the adverse parties. Taking advantage of the terror produced, by this  catastrophe, in the savages, Captain Erskine caused the men bearing the  corpse to retreat, with all possible expedition, under the ramparts of  the fort. He waited until they got nearly half way, and then threw  forward the wheeling sections, that had covered this movement, once  more into single file, in which order he commenced his retreat. Step by  step, and almost imperceptibly, the men paced backwards, ready, at a  moment's notice, to reform the square. Partly recovered from the terror  and surprise produced by the bursting of the shell, the Indians were  quick in perceiving this movement: filled with rage at having been so  long baulked of their aim, they threw themselves once more impetuously  from their cover; and, with stimulating yells, at length opened their  fire. Several of Captain Erskine's men were wounded by this discharge;  when, again, and furiously the cannon opened from the fort. It was then  that the superiority of the artillery was made manifest. Both right and  left of the retreating files the ponderous shot flew heavily past,  carrying death and terror to the Indians; while not a man of those who  intervened was scathed or touched in its progress. The warriors in the  forest were once more compelled to shelter themselves behind the trees;  but in the bomb-proof, where they were more secure, they were also more  bold. From this a galling fire, mingled with the most hideous yells,  was now kept up; and the detachment, in their slow retreat, suffered  considerably. Several men had been killed; and, about twenty, including  Lieutenant Johnstone, wounded, when again, one of those murderous  globes fell, hissing in the very centre of the bomb-proof. In an  instant, the Indian fire was discontinued; and their dark and pliant  forms were seen hurrying with almost incredible rapidity over the  dilapidated walls, and flying into the very heart of the forest, so  that when the shell exploded, a few seconds afterwards, not a warrior  was to be seen. From this moment the attack was not renewed, and  Captain Erskine made good his retreat without farther molestation.    \"Well, old buffers!\" exclaimed one of the leading files, as the  detachment, preceded by its dead and wounded, now moved along the moat  in the direction of the draw-bridge, \"how did you like the grip of them  black savages?--I say, Mitchell, old Nick will scarcely know the face  of you, it's so much altered by fright.--Did you see,\" turning to the  man in his rear, \"how harum-scarum he looked, when the captain called  out to him to come off?\"    \"Hold your clapper, you spooney, and be damned to you!\" exclaimed the  angry veteran.--\"Had the Ingian fastened his paw upon your ugly neck as  he did upon mine, all the pitiful life your mother ever put into you  would have been spirited away from very fear; so you needn't brag.\"    \"Sure, and if any of ye had a grain of spunk, ye would have fired, and  freed a fellow from the clutch of them hell thieves,\" muttered another  of the men at the litter. \"All the time, the devil had me by the  throat, swinging his tommyhawk about my head, I saw ye dancing up and  down in the heavens, instead of being on your marrow bones on the  common.\"    \"And didn't I want to do it?\" rejoined the first speaker. \"Ask Tom  Winkler here, if the captain didn't swear he'd cut the soul out of my  body if I even offered so much as to touch the trigger of my musket.\"    \"Faith, and lucky he did,\" replied his covering man (for the ranks had  again joined), \"since but for that, there wouldn't be at this moment so  much as a hair of the scalp of one of you left.\"    \"And how so, Mr. Wiseacre?\" rejoined his comrade.    \"How so! Because the first shot that we fired would have set the devils  upon them in right earnest--and then their top-knots wouldn't have been  worth a brass farthing. They would have been scalped before they could  say Jack Robinson.\"    \"It was a hell of a risk,\" resumed another of the litter men, \"to give  four men a chance of having their skull pieces cracked open like so  many egg-shells, and all to get possession of a dead officer.\"    \"And sure, you beast,\" remarked a different voice in a tone of anger,  \"the dead body of the brave captain was worth a dozen such rotten  carcasses with all the life in them. What matter would it be if ye had  all been scalped?\" Then with a significant half glance to the rear,  which was brought up by their commander, on whose arm leaned the  slightly wounded Johnstone, \"Take care the captain doesn't hear ye  prating after that fashion, Will Burford.\"    \"By Jasus,\" said a good-humoured, quaint looking Irishman, who had been  fixing his eyes on the litter during this pithy and characteristic  colloquy; \"it sames to me, my boys, that ye have caught the wrong cow  by the horns, and that all your pains has been for nothing at all, at  all. By the holy pope, ye are all wrong; it's like bringing salt butter  to Cork, or coals to your Newcastle, as ye call it. Who the divil ever  heard of the officer wearing ammunition shoes?\"    The men all turned their gaze on that part of the vestment of the  corpse to which their attention had been directed by this remark, when  it was at once perceived, although it had hitherto escaped the  observation even of the officers, that, not only the shoes were those  usually worn by the soldiers, and termed ammunition or store shoes, but  also, the trowsers were of the description of coarse grey, peculiar to  that class.    \"By the piper that played before Moses, and ye're right, Dick Doherty,\"  exclaimed another Irishman; \"sure, and it isn't the officer at all!  Just look at the great black fist of him too, and never call me Phil  Shehan, if it ever was made for the handling of an officer's spit.\"    \"Well said, Shehan,\" observed the man who had so warmly reproved Will  Burford, and who had formerly been servant to De Haldimar; \"the  captain's hand is as white and as soft as my cross-belt, or, what's  saying a great deal more, as Miss Clara's herself, heaven bless her  sweet countenance! and Lieutenant Valletort's nigger's couldn't well be  much blacker nor this.\"    \"What a set of hignoramuses ye must be,\" grunted old Mitchell, \"not to  see that the captain's hand is only covered with dirt; and as for the  ammunition shoes and trowsers, why you know our officers wear any thing  since we have been cooped up in this here fort.\"    \"Yes, by the holy poker,\" (and here we must beg to refer the reader to  the soldier's vocabulary for any terms that may be, in the course of  this dialogue, incomprehensible to him or her,)--\"Yes, by the holy  poker, off duty, if they like it,\" returned Phil Shehan; \"but it isn't  even the colonel's own born son that dare to do so while officer of the  guard.\"    \"Ye are right, comrade,\" said Burford; \"there would soon be hell and  tommy to pay if he did.\"    At this point of their conversation, one of the leading men at the  litter, in turning to look at its subject, stumbled over the root of a  stump that lay in his way, and fell violently forward. The sudden  action destroyed the equilibrium of the corpse, which rolled off its  temporary bier upon the earth, and disclosed, for the first time, a  face begrimmed with masses of clotted blood, which had streamed forth  from the scalped brain during the night.    \"It's the divil himself,\" said Phil Shehan, making the sign of the  cross, half in jest, half in earnest: \"for it isn't the captin at all,  and who but the divil could have managed to clap on his rigimintals?\"    \"No, it's an Ingian,\" remarked Dick Burford, sagaciously; \"it's an  Ingian that has killed the captain, and dressed himself in his clothes.  I thought he smelt strong, when I helped to pick him up.\"    \"And that's the reason why the bloody heathens wouldn't let us carry  him off,\" said another of the litter men. \"I thought they wouldn't ha'  made such a rout about the officer, when they had his scalp already in  their pouch-belts.\"    \"What a set of"]]]
