This they mark not, but heedless of right, turn each to his            own way,       Here, a heart fired with ambition, in strife and straining            unhallowed;       There, thrusting honour aside, fast set upon getting and gaining;       Others again given over to lusts and dissolute softness,       Working never God's Law, but that which wareth upon it.         Nay, but, O Giver of all things good, whose home is the dark cloud,       Thou that wields Heaven's bolt, save men from their            ignorance grievous;       Scatter its night from their souls, and grant them to come to            that Wisdom       Wherewithal, sistered with Justice, Thou rulest and governest            all things;       That we, honoured by Thee, may requite Thee with worship and            honour,       Evermore praising thy works, as is meet for men that shall perish;       Seeing that none, be he mortal or God, hath privilege nobler       Than without stint, without stay, to extol Thy Law universal."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],[0,"A Man of Means (#14)"],[1,"him to think of some one but himself. He was not fond  of Maraquita, but he had a tender heart, and this, he felt, would kill  the poor girl.    \"But Maraquita----?\"    \"That's all right, splendid old chap. No need to worry about Maraquita,  stout old boy. Where the husband goes, so does the wife go. As you say,  whither thou goes will I follow. No?\"    \"But I don't understand. Maraquita is not your wife?\"    \"Why, certainly, good old heart. What else?\"    \"Have you been married to her all the time?\"    \"Why, certainly, good, dear boy.\"    The room swam before Roland's eyes. There was no room in his mind  for meditations on the perfidy of woman. He groped forward and found  Bombito's hand.    \"By Jove,\" he said thickly, as he wrung it again and again, \"I knew you  were a good sort the first time I saw you. Have a drink or something.  Have a cigar or something. Have something, anyway, and sit down and tell  me all about it.\"            THE EPISODE OF THE HIRED PAST    Final Story of the Series [First published in _Pictorial Review_,  October 1916]      \"What do you mean--you can't marry him after all? After all what? Why  can't you marry him? You are perfectly childish.\"    Lord Evenwood's gentle voice, which had in its time lulled the House  of Peers to slumber more often than any voice ever heard in the  Gilded Chamber, had in it a note of unwonted, but quite justifiable,  irritation. If there was one thing more than another that Lord Evenwood  disliked, it was any interference with arrangements already made.    \"The man,\" he continued, \"is not unsightly. The man is not conspicuously  vulgar. The man does not eat peas with his knife. The man pronounces his  aitches with meticulous care and accuracy. The man, moreover, is worth  rather more than a quarter of a million pounds. I repeat, you are  childish!\"    \"Yes, I know he's a very decent little chap, Father,\" said Lady Eva.  \"It's not that at all.\"    \"I should be gratified, then, to hear what, in your opinion, it is.\"    \"Well, do you think I could be happy with him?\"    Lady Kimbuck gave tongue. She was Lord Evenwood's sister. She spent a  very happy widowhood interfering in the affairs of the various branches  of her family.    \"We're not asking you to be happy. You have such odd ideas of happiness.  Your idea of happiness is to be married to your cousin Gerry, whose only  visible means of support, so far as I can gather, is the four hundred  a year which he draws as a member for a constituency which has every  intention of throwing him out at the next election.\"    Lady Eva blushed. Lady Kimbuck's faculty for nosing out the secrets of  her family had made her justly disliked from the Hebrides to Southern  Cornwall.    \"Young O'Rion is not to be thought of,\" said Lord Evenwood firmly. \"Not  for an instant. Apart from anything else, his politics are all  wrong. Moreover, you are engaged to this Mr. Bleke. It is a sacred  responsibility not lightly to be evaded. You can not pledge your  word one day to enter upon the most solemn contract known to--ah--the  civilized world, and break it the next. It is not fair to the man. It is  not fair to me. You know that all I live for is to see you comfortably  settled. If I could myself do anything for you, the matter would be  different. But these abominable land-taxes and Blowick--especially  Blowick--no, no, it's out of the question. You will be very sorry if you  do anything foolish. I can assure you that Roland Blekes are not to be  found--ah--on every bush. Men are extremely shy of marrying nowadays.\"    \"Especially,\" said Lady Kimbuck, \"into a family like ours. What with  Blowick's scandal, and that shocking business of your grandfather  and the circus-woman, to say nothing of your poor father's trouble in  '85----\"    \"Thank you, Sophia,\" interrupted Lord Evenwood, hurriedly. \"It is  unnecessary to go into all that now. Suffice it that there are adequate  reasons, apart from all moral obligations, why Eva should not break her  word to Mr. Bleke.\"    Lady Kimbuck's encyclopedic grip of the family annals was a source of  the utmost discomfort to her relatives. It was known that more than one  firm of publishers had made her tempting offers for her reminiscences,  and the family looked on like nervous spectators at a battle while  Cupidity fought its ceaseless fight with Laziness; for the Evenwood  family had at various times and in various ways stimulated the  circulation of the evening papers. Most of them were living down  something, and it was Lady Kimbuck's habit, when thwarted in her  lightest whim, to retire to her boudoir and announce that she was not  to be disturbed as she was at last making a start on her book. Abject  surrender followed on the instant.    At this point in the discussion she folded up her crochet-work, and  rose.    \"It is absolutely necessary for you, my dear, to make a good match, or  you will all be ruined. I, of course, can always support my declining  years with literary work, but----\"    Lady Eva groaned. Against this last argument there was no appeal.    Lady Kimbuck patted her affectionately on the shoulder.    \"There, run along now,\" she said. \"I daresay you've got a headache or  something that made you say a lot of foolish things you didn't mean.  Go down to the drawing-room. I expect Mr. Bleke is waiting there to say  goodnight to you. I am sure he must be getting quite impatient.\"    Down in the drawing-room, Roland Bleke was hoping against hope that Lady  Eva's prolonged absence might be due to the fact that she had gone to  bed with a headache, and that he might escape the nightly interview  which he so dreaded.    Reviewing his career, as he sat there, Roland came to the conclusion  that women had the knack of affecting him with a form of temporary  insanity. They temporarily changed his whole nature. They made him feel  for a brief while that he was a dashing young man capable of the  highest flights of love. It was only later that the reaction came and he  realized that he was nothing of the sort.    At heart he was afraid of women, and in the entire list of the women of  whom he had been afraid, he could not find one who had terrified him so  much as Lady Eva Blyton.    Other women--notably Maraquita, now happily helping to direct the  destinies of Paranoya--had frightened him by their individuality. Lady  Eva frightened him both by her individuality and the atmosphere of  aristocratic exclusiveness which she conveyed. He had no idea whatever  of what was the proper procedure for a man engaged to the daughter of  an earl. Daughters of earls had been to him till now mere names in the  society columns of the morning paper. The very rules of the game were  beyond him. He felt like a confirmed Association footballer suddenly  called upon to play in an International Rugby match.    All along, from the very moment when--to his unbounded astonishment--she  had accepted him, he had known that he was making a mistake; but he  never realized it with such painful clearness as he did this evening.  He was filled with a sort of blind terror. He cursed the fate which had  taken him to the Charity-Bazaar at which he had first come under the  notice of Lady Kimbuck. The fatuous snobbishness which had made him leap  at her invitation to spend a few days at Evenwood Towers he regretted;  but for that he blamed himself less. Further acquaintance with Lady  Kimbuck had convinced him that if she had wanted him, she would have got  him somehow, whether he had accepted or refused.    What he really blamed himself for was his mad proposal. There had been  no need for it. True, Lady Eva had created a riot of burning emotions in  his breast from the moment they met; but he should have had the sense to  realize that she was not the right mate for him, even tho he might have  a quarter of a million tucked away in gilt-edged securities. Their lives  could not possibly mix. He was a commonplace young man with a fondness  for the pleasures of the people. He liked cheap papers, picture-palaces,  and Association football. Merely to think of Association football in  connection with her was enough to make the folly of his conduct  clear. He ought to have been content to worship her from afar as some  inaccessible goddess.    A light step outside the door made his heart stop beating.    \"I've just looked in to say good night, Mr.--er--Roland,\" she said,  holding out her hand. \"Do excuse me. I've got such a headache.\"    \"Oh, yes, rather; I'm awfully sorry.\"    If there was one person in the world Roland despised and hated at that  moment, it was himself.    \"Are you going out with the guns to-morrow?\" asked Lady Eva languidly.    \"Oh, yes, rather! I mean, no. I'm afraid I don't shoot.\"    The back of his neck began to glow. He had no illusions about himself.  He was the biggest ass in Christendom.    \"Perhaps you'd like to play a round of golf, then?\"    \"Oh, yes, rather! I mean, no.\" There it was again, that awful phrase. He  was certain he had not intended to utter it. She must be thinking him a  perfect lunatic. \"I don't play golf.\"    They stood looking at each other for a moment. It seemed to Roland that  her gaze was partly contemptuous, partly pitying. He longed to tell her  that, tho she had happened to pick on his weak points in the realm of  sport, there were things he could do. An insane desire came upon him  to babble about his school football team. Should he ask her to feel his  quite respectable biceps? No.    \"Never mind,\" she said, kindly. \"I daresay we shall think of something  to amuse you.\"    She held out her hand again. He took it in his for the briefest possible  instant, painfully conscious the while that his own hand was clammy from  the emotion through which he had been passing.    \"Good night.\"    \"Good night.\"    Thank Heaven, she was gone. That let him out for another twelve hours at  least.    A quarter of an hour later found Roland still sitting, where she had"]]]
