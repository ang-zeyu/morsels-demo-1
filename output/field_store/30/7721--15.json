This was to enable him to know when to begin recharging it.  When the current was all consumed it was necessary to store more in the  battery. This could be done by attaching wires from a dynamo, or, in an  emergency by tapping an electric light wire in the street. But as the  battery would enable the car to run many miles on one charging, Tom did  not think he would ever have to resort to the emergency charging  apparatus. He had a new system for this, one that enabled him to do the  work in much less than the usual time.    With his new car still unpainted, and rather rough and crude in  appearance, the lad started out alone one morning, his father and Mr.  Sharp having declined to accompany him, on the plea of business to  attend to, and Mr. Damon not being at the Swift house.    Tom rode about for several hours, giving his car several severe tests  in the way of going up hills, and speeding on the level. He was  proceeding along a quiet country road, in a small town about fifteen  miles from Shopton, when, as he flashed past the small railroad  station, he saw a familiar figure standing on the platform.    \"Why, Ned!\" called Tom, \"what are you doing over here?\"    \"I might ask the same thing of you. Is that your new car? It doesn't  look very new.\"    \"Yes, this is it. I haven't had a chance to paint and varnish it yet.  But you ought to see it go. What are doing here, though?\"    \"I came over on some bank business. A customer here had some bonds he  wanted to dispose of and I came for them. You see we're enlarging our  business since the new bank started.\"    \"Has it hurt your bank any?\"    \"Not yet, but Foger and his associates are trying hard to make us lose  money. Say, did you ever see such a place as this? I've got to wait two  hours for a train back to Shopton.\"    \"No you haven't.\"    \"Why not? Have they changed the timetable since I came over this  morning?\"    \"No, but you can ride back with me.  I'm going, and I'll show you what  my new electric car can do.\"    \"Good!\" cried the young bank cashier. \"You're just in time. I was  wondering how I could kill two hours, but now I'll get in your new car  and--\"    \"And maybe we'll kill a few chickens, or a dog or two when we get her  speeded up,\" put in Tom, with a laugh in which Ned joined.    The two lads, seated in the front part of the auto, were soon moving  down the hard highway. Suddenly Tom pulled a lever and the steel  wind-shield came sliding down from the top case, meeting the forward  battery compartment, and forming a sort of slanting roof over the heads  of the two occupants.    \"Here! What's this?\" cried Ned.    \"We're going to hit it up in a few minutes,\" replied the young  inventor, \"and I want to reduce the wind resistance.\"    \"Oh, I thought maybe we were going through a bombardment. It's all  right, go ahead, don't mind me. I'm game.\"    There was a celluloid window in the steel wind-shield, and through this  the lads could observe the road ahead of them.    As they swung along it, the speed increasing, Ned saw an auto ahead of  them.    \"Whose car is that?\" he asked.    \"Don't know,\" replied Tom. \"We'll be up to it in about half a minute,  though.\"    As the electric runabout, more dilapidated looking than ever from the  layer of dust that covered it, passed the other auto, which was a  powerful car, the solitary occupant of it, a middle-aged man, looked to  one side, and, seeing the queer machine, remarked:    \"You fellows are going the wrong way to the junk heap. Turn around.\"    \"Is that so?\" asked Tom, his eyes flashing at the cheap wit of the man.  \"Why we came out here to show you the way!\"    \"Do you want to race?\" asked the man eagerly, too eagerly, Ned thought.  \"I'll give you a brush, if you do, and a handicap into the bargain.\"    \"We don't need it,\" replied the young inventor quickly.    \"I'll wager fifty dollars I can beat you bad on this three-mile  stretch,\" went on the autoist. \"How about it?\"    \"I'll race you, but I don't bet,\" answered Tom, a bit stiffly.    \"Oh, be a sport,\" urged the man.    Tom shook his head. He had slowed down his machine, and was running  even with the gasolene car now. He noticed that it was a new one, of  six cylinders, and looked speedy. Perhaps he was foolish to pit his  untried car against it. Yet he had confidence in his battery and motor.    \"Well, we'll race for the fun of it then,\" went on the man. \"Do you  want a handicap?\"    Tom shook his head again, and there came around his mouth a grim look.    \"All right,\" assented the other. \"Only you're going to be beat badly. I  never saw an electric car yet that could do anything except to crawl  along.\"    \"You're going to see one now,\" was all the retort Tom permitted himself.    \"Here we go then!\" cried the man, and he gave his gear handle a yank,  and shoved over the sparking and gasolene levers.    His car instantly shot ahead, and went \"chug chugging\" down the road in  a cloud of dust. At the same moment Tom, in answer to a look from Ned,  who feared his friend was going to be left behind, turned more power  into the motor. The humming, purring sound increased and the electric  car forged ahead.    \"Can you catch him?\" asked Ned.    \"Watch,\" was all Tom said.    The hum of the motor became a sort of whine, and the electric rapidly  acquired speed. It crept up on the gasolene car, as an express train  overtakes a freight, and the man, looking back, and expecting to see  his rival far behind was surprised to note the queer looking vehicle  lapping his rear wheels.    \"Well, you are coming on, aren't you?\" he asked. \"Maybe you'll keep up  now!\" He shifted the gears, using a little more gasolene.  For a moment  his car opened a wide gap between it and Tom's, but the young inventor  had only begun to race. Still louder purred the motor, and in a few  minutes Tom was running on even terms with his competitor. The man  looked annoyed, and tried, by the skilful use of gasolene and sparking  levers, to leave Tom behind.  But the electric held her own.    \"I've got to go the limit I see,\" remarked the man at last, glancing  sideways at the other car. \"I'll tell 'em you're coming,\" he added,  \"though I must say your electric does better than any of its kind I  ever came across.\"    \"I'm not done yet,\" was the comment of our hero. But the man did not  hear him, for he was yanking into place the lever that enabled him to  run on direct drive for fourth speed.    Forward shot his car, and, for perhaps a quarter of a mile it led. The  racers were almost at the end of the three-mile level stretch of road,  and if Tom was going to win the impromptu contest it seemed high time  he began.    \"Can you catch him?\" asked Ned anxiously.    \"Watch,\" was his chum's reply. \"I haven't used my high speed gear yet.  I'm afraid the fuses won't stand it, but here goes for a try, anyhow.\"    He threw over a switch, changed a lever and then, having pushed into  place the last gear, he grasped the steering wheel more firmly.    There was need of it, for, in an instant, the electric runabout, with  the motors fairly roaring, swept up the road, after the gasolene car  that was almost hidden from sight in a cloud of dust. Faster and faster  went Tom's car. The young inventor was listening with critical ear to  the song of the machinery. He wanted to learn if it was running sweet  and true, for that is how a careful mechanic tests his apparatus. Foot  by foot the distance between the two cars lessened. Now the electric  was lapping the rear wheels of the gasolene machine, but the driver did  not know it. His whole attention was on the road ahead of him.    \"Half a mile more!\" cried Ned, naming the distance which yet remained  of the straight stretch. \"Can you do it, Tom?\"    His chum nodded. He shoved the controller handle over to the last  notch, and then waited an anxious second. Would the fuse carry the  extra load? It seemed so, for there was a slight increase of power.    An instant later Tom gave a sudden twist to the steering wheel.  It was  well that he did, for he was passing the gasolene car dangerously  close. Then he was ahead of it, and in a second he was three lengths in  advance.    Desperately the man opened his muffler, and sought to gain by this  advantage, but though his car gave off explosions like a battery of  guns in action, he could not gain on Tom. The electric shot around a  curve in the road, winner of the impromptu race by an eighth of a mile.    \"Well,\" asked Tom of his chum, as he slowed down, for the road now was  not so good, \"did I do it?\"    \"You certainly did. Whew! But we did scoot along?\"    \"Eighty miles an hour there one spell,\" went on the young inventor,  glancing at a gauge. \"But I've got to do better than that to win the  big race.\"          CHAPTER XV    ANDY FOGER'S BLACK EYE      Around the bend came the six-cylinder touring car. The driver, with a  surprised look on his face, was slacking up. He ran his machine up  alongside of Tom's.    \"Say,\" he asked, in dazed tones, \"did you take a short cut, or anything  like that to get ahead of me?\"    \"No,\" answered the youth.    \"And you didn't jump me in the air?\"    \"No,\" was Tom's answer, smilingly given.    \"Well, all I've got to say is that you've got a wonderful car there,  Mr.--er--er--\"  He paused suggestively.    \"Swift is my name,\" our hero answered. \"Thomas Swift, of Shopton.\"    \"Ah, I've heard of you. My name is Layton--Paul Layton. I'm from  Netherton. Let's see, you built an airship, didn't you?\"    \"I helped,\" Tom admitted modestly.    \"Well, you beat me fair and square, and if I do say it myself I've got  a fairly speedy car. Took two firsts at the Indianapolis meet last  month. But you certainly scooted ahead of me. Where did you buy that  electric, if I may ask?\"    \"I made it.\"    \"I might have known,\" admitted the man. \"But are you going to put them  on the market? If you are I'd like to get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#14)"],[1,"was not marked by any disturbance, and after breakfast, Tom,  under the guidance of the Titus brothers, looked over the tunnel with a  view to making his first experiment with the new explosive.    The tunnel was being driven straight into the face of one of the  smaller ranges of the Andes Mountains. It was to be four miles in  length, and when it emerged on the other side it would enable trains to  make connections between the two railroads, thus tapping a rich and  fertile country.    On the site of the tunnel, which was two days' mule travel east from  Rimac, the Titus brothers had assembled their heavy machinery. They had  brought some of their own men, including Tim Sullivan, with them, but  the other labor was that of Peruvian Indians, with a native foreman,  Serato, over them.    There were engines, boilers, dynamos, motors, diamond drills, steam  shovels and a miniature railway, with mules as the motive power. A  small village had sprung up at the tunnel mouth, and there was a  general store, besides many buildings for the sleeping and eating  quarters of the laborers, as well as places where the white men could  live.  Their quarters were some distance from the native section.    Powder, supplies, in fact everything save what game could be obtained  in the forest, or what grains or fruits were brought in by natives  living near by, had to be brought over the rough trail. But Titus  Brothers had a large experience in engineering matters in wild and  desolate countries, and they knew how to be as comfortable as possible.    Mr. Damon learned that one of the districts whence his company had been  in the habit of getting quinine was distant a day's journey over the  mountain, so he decided to make the trip, with a native guide, and see  if he could get at the bottom of the difficulty in forwarding shipments.    This was a few days after the arrival of our friends.  Meanwhile, Tom  had been shown all through the tunnel by the Titus Brothers and had had  his first sight of the hard cliff of rock which seemed to be a  veritable stone wall in the way of progress--or at least such progress  as was satisfactory to the contractors.    \"Well, we'll try what some of my explosive will do,\" said Tom, when he  had finished the examination. \"I don't claim it will be as successful  as the sample blast we set off at Shopton, but we'll do our best.\"    Holes were drilled in the face of the rock, and several charges of the  new explosive tamped in. Wires were attached to the fuses, which were  of a new kind, and warning was given to clear the tunnel. The wires ran  out to the mouth of the horizontal shaft and Tom, holding the switch in  his hand made ready to set off the blast.    \"Are they all out?\" he asked Tim Sullivan, who had emerged, herding the  Indian laborers before him. Tim insisted on being the last man to seek  safety when an explosion was to take place.    \"All ready, sor,\" answered the foreman.    \"Here she goes!\" cried Tom, as his fingers closed the circuit.          Chapter XIV    Mysterious Disappearances      There was a dull, muffled report, a sort of rumbling that seemed to  extend away down under the earth and then echo back again until the  ground near the mouth of the tunnel, where the party was standing,  appeared to rock and heave.  There followed a cloud of yellow, heavy  smoke which made one choke and gasp, and Tom, seeing it, cried:    \"Down! Down, everybody! There's a back draft, and if you breathe any of  that powder vapor you'll have a fearful headache! Get down, until the  smoke rises!\"    The tunnel contractors and their men understood the danger, for they  had handled explosives before. It is a well-known fact that the fumes  of dynamite and other giant powders will often produce severe  headaches, and even illness. Tom's explosive contained a certain  percentage of dynamite, and he knew its ill effects. Stretched prone,  or crouching on the ground, there was little danger, as the fumes,  being lighter than air, rose. The yellow haze soon drifted away, and it  was safe to rise.    \"Well, I wonder how much rock your explosive tore loose for us, Tom,\"  observed Job Titus, as he looked at the thin, yellowish cloud of smoke  that was still lazily drifting from the tunnel.    \"Can't tell until we go in and take a look,\" replied the young  inventor. \"It won't be safe to go in for a while yet, though. That  smoke will hang in there a long time. I didn't think there'd be a back  draft.\"    \"There is, for we've often had the same trouble with our shots,\" Walter  Titus said. \"I can't account for it unless there is some opening in the  shaft, connecting with the outer air, which admits a wind that drives  the smoke out of the mouth, instead of forward into the blast hole.  It's a queer thing and we haven't been able to get at the bottom of it.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed his brother. \"We've looked for some opening, or  natural shaft, but haven't been able to find it.  Sometimes we shoot  off a charge and everything goes well, the smoke disappears in a few  minutes. Again it will all blow out this way and we lose half a day  waiting for the air to clear. There's a hidden shaft, or natural  chimney, I'm sure, but we can't find it.\"    \"Thot blast didn't make much racket,\" commented Tim Sullivan. \"I doubt  thot much rock come down. An' thot's not sayin' anythin' ag'in yer  powder, lad,\" he went on to Tom.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" Tom Swift replied, with a laugh.  \"My explosive  doesn't work by sound. It has lots of power, but it doesn't produce  much concussion.\"    \"We've often made more noise with our blasts,\" confirmed Job Titus,  \"but I can't say much for our results.\"    They were all anxious, Tom included, to hurry into the tunnel to see  how much rock had been loosened by the blast, but it was not safe to  venture in until the fumes had been allowed to disperse. In about an  hour, however, Tim Sullivan, venturing part way in, sniffed the air and  called:    \"It's all right, byes! Air's clear. Now come on!\"    They all hurried eagerly into the shaft, Mr. Damon stumbling along at  Tom's side, as anxious as the lad himself. Before they reached the face  of the cliff against which the bore had been driven, and which was as a  solid wall of rock to further progress, they began to tread on  fragments of stone.    \"Well, it blew some as far back as here,\" said Walter Titus. \"That's a  good sign.\"    \"I hope so,\" Tom remarked.    There were still some fumes noticeable in the tunnel, and Mr. Damon  complained of a slight feeling of illness, while Koku, who kept at  Tom's side, murmured that it made his eyes smart. But the sensations  soon passed.    They came to a stop as the face of the cliff loomed into view in the  glare of a searchlight which Job Titus switched on. Then a murmur of  wonder came from every one, save from Tom Swift. He, modestly, kept  silent.    \"Bless my breakfast orange!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What a big hole!\"    There was a great gash blown in the hard rock which had acted as a bar  to the further progress of the tunnel. A great heap of rock, broken  into small fragments, was on the floor of the shaft, and there was a  big hole filled with debris which would have to be removed before the  extent of the blast could be seen.    \"That's doing the work!\" cried Job Titus.    \"It beats any two blasts we ever set off,\" declared his brother.    \"Much fine!\" muttered the Peruvian foreman, Serato.    \"It's a lalapaloosa, lad!  Thot's what it is!\" enthusiastically  exclaimed Tim Sullivan. \"Now the black beggars will have some rock to  shovel! Come on there, Serato, git yer lazy imps t' work cartin' this  stuff away.  We've got a man on th' job now in this new powder of Tom  Swift's. Git busy!\"    \"Um!\" grunted the Indian, and he called to his men who were soon busy  with picks and shovels, loading the loosened rock and earth into the  mule-hauled dump cars which took it to the mouth of the tunnel, whence  it was shunted off on another small railroad to fill in a big gulch to  save bridging it.    Tom's first blast was very successful, and enough rock was loosed to  keep the laborers busy for a week. The contractors were more than  satisfied.    \"At this rate we'll finish ahead of time, and earn a premium,\" said Job  to his brother.    \"That's right. You didn't make any mistake in appealing to Tom Swift.  But I wonder if Blakeson & Grinder have given up trying to get the job  away from us?\"    \"I don't know. I'd never trust them. We must watch out for Waddington.  That bomb on the vessel had a funny look, even if it was not meant to  kill Tom or me. I won't relax any.\"    \"No, I guess it wouldn't be safe.\"    But a week went by without any manifestation having been made by the  rival tunnel contractors. During that week more of Tom's explosive  arrived, and he busied himself getting ready another blast which could  be set off as soon as the debris from the first should have been  cleared away.    Meanwhile, Professor Bumper, with his Indian guides and helpers, had  made several trips into the mountain regions about Rimac, but each time  that he returned to the tunnel camp to renew his supplies, he had only  a story of failure to recite.    \"But I am positive that somewhere in this vicinity is the lost Peruvian  city of Pelone,\" he said. \"Every indication points to this as the  region, and the more I study the plates of gold, and read their  message, the more I am convinced that this is the place spoken of.    \"But we have been over many mountains, and in more valleys, without  finding a trace of the ancient civilization I feel sure once flourished  here. There are no relics of a lost race--not so much as an arrow or  spear head. But, somehow or other, I feel that I shall find the lost  city.  And when I do I shall be famous!\"    \"Mr. Damon and I will help you all we can,\" Tom said. \"As soon as I get  ready the next blast I'll have a little time to myself, and we will go  with you on a trip"]]]
