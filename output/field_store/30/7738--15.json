The native name of the  spot was \"Warranb.\" The soft earth had again impeded the drays; the teams  of two came in at twilight, an axle of one dray having been damaged; the  six others were brought up in the course of the evening. Thermometer at  sunrise, 60 deg.; at 4 P. M., 103 deg.; at 9, 78 deg.;--with wet bulb, 68 deg..    21ST FEBRUARY.--The first thing done this morning was to send back cattle  to draw forward the dray with a bent axle, to the camp, that it might be  repaired. This was done so as to enable the party to continue the journey  by 1 P. M. The barometer was going down at a rate which was alarming  enough, considering what our position must have been there in a flood, or  even after a heavy fall of rain. I therefore pressed forward with the  light carts, and guided by the native. He brought us at 5 P. M. to  \"Willery,\" the place where he had expected to find water; but here again,  he had been anticipated by cattle, which had drunk up all, and trodden  the ponds as dry as a market-place. He gave us no hopes of finding water  that night, nor until we could reach the Barwan, then distant, I was  quite sure, at least twenty-four miles, according to the latitude  observed (30 deg. 19' 54\" South). We encamped here, and I sent back  directions that the drays should at once halt, taking their places beside  the leading dray, and that the cattle should be driven back in the  morning to be watered at the last camp (Warranb), and then to return and  follow in my track. Mr. Drysdale, the storekeeper, had also to go back to  serve out a week's rations to the party with the drays, and he returned  to my camp by 2 A. M., in the moonlight, bringing, on the horse of the  former messenger, rations for my party. Here we found the KERAUDRENIA  INTEGRIFOLIA. Thermometer at sunrise, 70 deg.; at noon, 105 deg.; at 9, 83 deg.;--  with wet bulb, 57 deg..    22D FEBRUARY.--My guide was now desirous that I should cross the  Macquarie, to open plains which he represented to be much more favourable  for wheel carriages; but I endeavoured to explain to him, by drawing  lines in the clay surface, how the various rivers beyond would cross and  impede my journey to the Barwan. There were the Castlereagh, Morissett's  Ponds, and the Nammoy.[* If Arrowsmith's map had been correct, which it  was not, for the Nammoy joins the Darling separately, at least fifty  miles higher than the junction of the Castlereagh.]    An instance occurred here of the uselessness of new names, and the  necessity for preserving the native names of Rivers. I could refer, in  communicating with our guide, to the Nammoy only, and to the hills which  partly supplied the Castlereagh, whereof the native name was  Wallambangle. I wanted to make them understand the probability that some  flood had come down the channel of the Castlereagh, and that we might  therefore hope to find water below its junction with the Macquarie. This,  with the aid of Yuranigh, our own native, was at length made intelligible  to our Barwan guide, and he shaped his course accordingly. He took us  through scrubs, having in the centre those holes where water usually  lodges for some time after rain, where some substratum of clay happens to  be retentive enough to impede the common absorption. But the water in  these holes had been recently drunk, and the mud trampled into hard clay  by the hoofs of cattle. Thus it is, that the aborigines first become  sensible of the approach of the white man. These retired spots, where  nature was wont to supply enough for their own little wants, are well  known to the denizens of the bush. Each locality has a name, and such  places are frequented by helpless females with their children, or by the  most peaceably disposed natives with their families. There they can exist  apart from belligerent tribes, such as assemble on large rivers. Cattle  find these places and come from stations often many miles distant,  attracted by the rich verdure usually growing about them, and by thus  treading the water into mud, or by drinking it up, they literally destroy  the whole country for the aborigines, and thereby also banish from it the  kangaroos, emus, and other animals on which they live. I felt much more  disgusted than the poor natives, while they were thus exploring in vain  every hollow in search of water for our use, that our \"cloven foot\"  should appear everywhere. The day was extremely hot, which usually  happened to be the case whenever we were obliged to experience the want  of water. The thermometer under a tree stood at 110 deg.. The store-keeper  was taken ill with vertigo. Our bull-dog perished in the heat, and the  fate of the cattle, still a day's journey behind us, and of the sheep,  which had not drunk for two days, were subjects of much anxiety to me at  that time. It may, therefore, be imagined with what pleasure I at length  saw before me large basins of water in the channel of the Macquarie, when  I next approached the banks, after a journey at a good pace for six hours  and a half. We had made it below the junction of Morissett's Ponds, and  found that a recent flood had filled its channel with water. The natives  dived into it to cure their headaches, as they said, and seemed to go  completely under water, in order to take a cool drink. We had reached the  united channel of the Macquarie and Morissett's Ponds, and were at an  easy day's journey only distant from the junction with the BARWAN or  \"Darling.\" The use of the aboriginal name of this river is indispensable  amongst the squatters along its banks, who do not appear to know it to be  the \"Darling.\" It is most desirable to restore to such rivers their  proper names as early as possible after they have been ascertained, were  it only to enable strangers thereby to avail themselves of the  intelligence and assistance of the natives, in identifying the country by  means of the published maps. The river Castlereagh is known to the  natives as the Barr; Morissett's Ponds, as the Wawill; and the lower part  of the Macquarie, as the Wammerawa. The squatting system of occupation  requires still more that the native names of rivers should be known to  commissioners empowered to parcel out unsurveyed regions of vast extent,  whereof the western limits would be, indeed, beyond their reach or  control, but for the line of an angry savage population, which line the  squatter dares not to cross unsupported by an armed mounted police.  Thermometer at sunrise, 59 deg.; at noon, 110 deg.; at 4 P. M., 107 deg.; at 9, 89 deg.;  --with wet bulb 72 deg..    23RD FEBRUARY.--The drays did not come up, nor was any intelligence of  them received at our camp until late in the afternoon, when a man I had  sent back in the morning to tell the drivers to halt in good time to send  forward the cattle by daylight along my track to the water, brought me  word that he left them on the way ten miles off about eleven in the  morning. This man (Smith) also brought forward the sheep with him. They  had not drank for two nights, and ran skipping and baaing to the water,  as soon as they saw it. The heat of this day and yesterday was excessive,  a hot wind blowing hard all the time. Among the scrub on the banks of the  Macquarie, a salt plant belonging to the genus SCLEROLOENA was remarked;  it was perhaps not distinct from S. UNIFLORA. The GOODENIA GENICULATA  overran the ground, with its strawberry-like runners, and yellow flowers.  Latitude, 30 deg. 12' 56\" S. Thermometer at sunrise, 75 deg.; at noon, 105 deg.; at 4  P.M., 94 deg.; at 9, 73 deg.;--with wet bulb, 62 deg..    24TH FEBRUARY.--Some of the teams came up, having been out all night. The  drivers brought me word that they had been detached at twilight to come  six miles; the night was very dark; of course they could not see my  track, and as a matter equally of course, the spare bullocks had strayed  from them. Such were the almost daily recurring causes of delay by the  bullock drivers on this journey. Here, within a day's journey (thirteen  miles) of the Barwan, I was compelled to halt thus several days, and  really the prospect of performing so long a journey with such drivers  seemed almost hopeless. Thermometer at sunrise, 59 deg.; at noon, 80 deg.; at 4  P.M., 85 deg.; at 9, 64 deg.;--with wet bulb, 59 deg..    25TH FEBRUARY.--In the evening, the carpenter brought in ten of the stray  bullocks; four were still wanting, and I dispatched Mortimer, a bullock  driver, and the carpenter to show him where he had last left the track of  the animals still astray; both were mounted. Thermometer at sunrise, 53 deg.;  at noon, 90 deg.; at 4 P.M., 94 deg.; at 9, 79 deg.;--with wet bulb, 62 deg..    26TH FEBRUARY.--Mortimer came in early, saying he had found only one of  the bullocks, that the others had gone back to the last wateringplace  twenty-two miles distant. His companion did not arrive during the day; he  said he had left him bringing on the animal they had fallen in with. I  blamed him for leaving him, and ordered him to find him forthwith on  foot. I could not afford to lose horses. Here, it seemed, we were doomed  to remain. I endeavoured to make the most of the time by carrying on the  mapping of our survey, in order to make good our longitude at crossing  the Barwan. Thermometer at sunrise, 60 deg.; at noon, 94 deg.; at 4 P.M., 101 deg.;  at 9, 72 deg.;--with wet bulb, 62. deg.    27TH FEBRUARY.--When the teams were about to be put to the drays this  morning, I was informed that five bullocks were astray. This delayed the  party until 10 A.M., and then we left one lame bullock still missing. I  reduced the men's rations by one pound per week, and declared that a  proportional reduction should be regularly made to correspond with such  unlooked-for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#14)"],[1,"quiet smile.    \"Why do you smile? Did he say anything funny when you showed yourself  that day?\"    \"Oh, Elsie, have you tried putting up your hair?\" asked Carrie; while  Lucy exclaimed, \"Try it again to-night, Elsie, I should like to see  how you would look.\"    \"Yes,\" said Elsie, answering Carrie's query first. \"Enna persuaded me  one day to have mammy do it up in young-lady fashion. I liked it right  well for a change, and that was just what mamma said when I went into  the drawing-room and showed myself to her. But when papa came in, he  looked at me with a comical sort of surprise in his face, and said.  'Come here; what have you been doing to yourself?' I went to him and  he pulled out my comb, and ordered me off to mammy to have my hair  arranged again in the usual way, saying, 'I'm not going to have you  aping the woman already; don't alter the style of wearing your hair  again, till I give you permission.'    \"And you walked off as meek as Moses, and did his bidding,\" said Enna  sarcastically. \"No man shall ever rule me so. If papa should undertake  to give me such an order, I'd just inform him that my hair was my own,  and I should arrange it as suited my own fancy.\"    \"I think you are making yourself out worse than you really are,  Enna,\" said Elsie gravely. \"I am sure you could never say anything so  extremely impertinent as that to grandpa.\"    \"Impertinent! Well, if you believe it necessary to be so very  respectful, consistency should lead you to refrain from reproving your  aunt.\"    \"I did not exactly mean to reprove you, Enna, and you are younger than  I.\"    \"Nobody would think it,\" remarked Enna superciliously and with a  second toss of her head, as she turned from the glass; \"you are so  extremely childish in every way, while, as mamma says, I grow more  womanly in appearance and manner every day.\"    \"Elsie's manners are quite perfect, I think,\" said Carrie; \"and her  hair is so beautiful, I don't believe any other style of arrangement  could improve its appearance in the least.\"    \"But it's so childish, so absurdly childish! just that great mass of  ringlets hanging about her neck and shoulders. Come, Elsie, I want you  to have it dressed in this new style for to-night.\"    \"No, Enna, I am perfectly satisfied to wear it in this childish  fashion; and if I were not, still I could not disobey papa.\"    Enna turned away with a contemptuous sniff, and Lucy proposed that  they should go down to the drawing-room, and try some new music she  had just received, until it should be time to dress for the evening.    Herbert lay on a sofa listening to their playing. \"Lucy,\" he said in  one of the pauses, \"what amusements are we to have to-night?--anything  beside the harp, piano, and conversation?\"    \"Dancing, of course. Cad's fiddle will provide as good music as any  one need care for, and this room is large enough for all who will be  here. Our party is not to be very large, you know.\"    \"And Elsie, for one, is too pious to dance,\" sneered Enna.    Elsie colored, but remained silent.    \"Oh! I did not think of that!\" cried Lucy. \"Elsie, do you really think  it is a sinful amusement?\"    \"I think it wrong to go to balls; at least that it would be wrong for  me, a professed Christian, Lucy.\"    \"But this will not be a ball, and we'll have nothing but quiet country  dances, or something of that sort, no waltzing or anything at all  objectionable. What harm can there be in jumping about in that way  more than in another?\"    \"None that I know of,\" answered Elsie, smiling. \"And I certainly shall  not object to others doing as they like, provided I am not asked to  take part in it.\"    \"But why not take part, if it is not wrong?\" asked Harry, coming in  from the veranda.    \"Why, don't you know she never does anything without asking the  permission of papa?\" queried Enna tauntingly. \"But where's the use of  consulting her wishes in the matter, or urging her to take part in the  wicked amusement?--she'll have to go to bed at nine o'clock, like any  other well-trained child, and we'll have time enough for our dancing  after that.\"    \"Oh, Elsie, must you?--must you really leave us at that early hour?  Why, that's entirely too bad!\" cried the others in excited chorus.    \"I shall stay up till ten,\" answered Elsie quietly, while a deep flush  suffused her cheek.    \"That is better, but we shall not know how to spare you even that  soon,\" said Harry. \"Couldn't you make it eleven?--that would not be so  very late just for once.\"    \"No, for she can't break her rules, or disobey orders. If she did,  papa would be sure to find it out and punish her when she gets home.\"    \"For shame, Enna! that's quite too bad!\" cried Carrie and Lucy in a  breath.    Elsie's color deepened, and there was a flash of anger and scorn in  her eyes as she turned for an instant upon Enna. Then she replied  firmly, though with a slight tremble of indignation in her tones: \"I  am not ashamed to own that I do find it both a duty and a pleasure to  obey my father, whether he be present or absent. I have confidence,  too, in both his wisdom and his love for me. He thinks early hours of  great importance, especially to those who are young and growing, and  therefore he made it a rule that I shall retire to my room and begin  my preparations for bed by nine o'clock. But he gave me leave to stay  up an hour later to-night, and I intend to do so.\"    \"I think you are a very good girl, and feel just right about it,\" said  Carrie.    \"I wish he had said eleven, I think he might this once,\" remarked  Lucy. \"Why, don't you remember he let you stay up till ten Christmas  Eve that time we all spent the holidays at Roselands, which was five  years ago?\"    \"Yes,\" said Elsie, \"but this is Saturday night, and as to-morrow is  the Sabbath, I should not feel it to be right to stay up later, even  if I had permission.\"    \"Why not? it isn't Sunday till twelve,\" said Herbert.    \"No, but I should be apt to oversleep myself, and be dull and drowsy  in church next morning.\"    \"Quite a saint!\" muttered Enna, shrugging her shoulders and marching  off to the other side of the room.    \"Suppose we go and select some flowers for our hair,\" said Lucy,  looking at her watch. \"'Twill be tea-time presently, and we'll want to  dress directly after.\"    \"You always were such a dear good girl,\" whispered Carrie Howard,  putting her arm about Elsie's waist as they left the room.    Enna was quite gorgeous that evening, in a bright-colored silk,  trimmed with multitudinous flounces and many yards of ribbon and gimp.  The young damsel had a decidedly gay taste, and glanced somewhat  contemptuously at Elsie's dress of simple white, albeit 'twas of the  finest India muslin and trimmed with costly lace. She wore her pearl  necklace and bracelets, a broad sash of rich white ribbon; no other  ornaments save a half-blown moss rosebud at her bosom, and another  amid the glossy ringlets of her hair, their green leaves the only bit  of color about her.    \"You look like a bride,\" said Herbert, gazing admiringly upon her.    \"Do I?\" she answered smiling, as she turned and tripped lightly away;  for Lucy was calling to her from the next room.    Herbert's eyes followed her with a wistful, longing look in them, and  he sighed sadly to himself as she disappeared from his view.    Most of the guests came early; among them, Walter and Arthur Dinsmore;  Elsie had not seen the latter since his encounter with Mr. Travilla.  He gave her a sullen nod on entering the room, but took no further  notice of her.    Chit-chat, promenading and the music of the piano and harp were  the order of the evening for a time; then games were proposed, and  \"Consequences,\" \"How do you like it?\" and \"Genteel lady, always  genteel,\" afforded much amusement. Herbert could join in these, and  did with much spirit. But dancing was a favorite pastime with the  young people of the neighborhood, and the clock had hardly struck nine  when Cadmus and his fiddle were summoned to their aid, chairs and  tables were put out of the way, and sets began to form.    Elsie was in great request; the young gentlemen flocked about her,  with urgent entreaties that she would join in the amusement, each  claiming the honor of her hand in one or more sets, but she steadily  declined.    A glad smile lighted up Herbert's countenance, as he saw one and  another turn and walk away with a look of chagrin and disappointment.    \"Since my misfortune compels me to act the part of a wallflower, I am  selfish enough, I own, to rejoice in your decision to be one also,\" he  said gleefully. \"Will you take a seat with me on this sofa? I presume  your conscience does not forbid you to watch the dancers?\"    \"No, not at all,\" she answered, accepting his invitation.    Elsie's eyes followed with eager interest the swiftly moving forms,  but Herbert's were often turned admiringly upon her. At length he  asked if she did not find the room rather warm and close, and proposed  that they should go out upon the veranda. She gave a willing assent  and they passed quietly out and sat down side by side on a rustic  seat.    The full moon shone upon them from a beautiful blue sky, while a  refreshing breeze, fragrant with the odor of flowers and pines, gently  fanned their cheeks and played among the rich masses of Elsie's hair.    They found a good deal to talk about; they always did, for they were  kindred spirits. Their chat was now grave, now gay--generally the  latter; for Cad's music was inspiriting; but whatever the theme of  their discourse, Herbert's eyes were constantly seeking the face of  his companion.    \"How beautiful you are, Elsie!\" he exclaimed at length, in a tone of  such earnest sincerity that it made her laugh, the words seemed to  rush spontaneously from his lips. \"You are always lovely, but to-night  especially so.\"    \"It's the moonlight, Herbert; there's a sort of witchery about it,  that lends beauty to many an object"]]]
