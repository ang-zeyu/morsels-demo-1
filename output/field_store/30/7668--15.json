She wrote anonymous  poems and popped them in the letter-box, hoping, however, that her  writing might be recognised. Whether Miss Mitchell read them or not is  uncertain; she made no mention at any rate of their receipt, and probably  dropped them in the waste-paper basket. Merle would have been far more  grieved over these repulses had there not been a counter interest at  home. At the beginning of November Dr. and Mrs. Ramsay left the north  altogether and came to settle at Durracombe. Naturally there were great  changes at Bridge House. Jessop--the invaluable Jessop, who had been so  many years in Dr. Tremayne's service--was leaving to take charge of a  widower brother, and a young parlour-maid was coming in her place.  Several rooms were cleared to make way for Dr. Ramsay's possessions, and  a large motor van arrived bearing some of his furniture from Whinburn.  Mrs. Ramsay was to have a little upstairs drawing-room of her own, in  which to deposit her special treasures, and her husband was to turn the  gun-room into his study. The delight and excitement of welcoming her  father and mother made Merle temporarily dethrone Miss Mitchell in her  heart. It was such fun to help to arrange all the things from home, and  see how nice they looked in their new surroundings. Then Dr. Ramsay had  brought his car, and of course Merle wanted to help to clean it and to go  out with her father in it and coax him to allow her to drive. Everybody  felt that it was ideal to have Mrs. Ramsay at Bridge House. She took the  place of a daughter to Aunt Nellie, who was somewhat of an invalid, and  would nurse her and manage the housekeeping for her instead of Jessop.  She had always loved her native county of Devon, and rejoiced to return  there instead of living in the north.    \"I shall grow young again here!\" she declared. \"I'm going to try to find  time to do some sketching. I've hardly touched my paintbox for years.  Mavis and I must go out together and find subjects.\"    \"While I drive Daddy about in the car!\" decreed Merle. \"I've told him I'm  going to be his chauffeur as soon as I leave school. He didn't jump at  the offer! Wasn't it ungrateful of him? He doesn't deserve to have a  daughter! Oh, well, yes, I _did_ run the car into the hedge  yesterday, but there was no damage done, after all.\"    Dr. Tremayne thoroughly welcomed Dr. Ramsay as his partner. The calls of  the practice had lately been growing too much for him, and he was glad to  be able to share the numerous visits, so the arrangement of joining  households was a satisfaction to all concerned. Jessop wept when it came  to the time of her departure.    \"I've been here thirty-two years come Christmas!\" she said. \"I know it's  the best for everybody, but I do feel it. I'm fond of my brother, and  willing to look after him and the shop, but I'll miss the patients here!  I've known many of them since they were born. At my age it's hard to make  a change and settle down afresh.\"    \"We'll motor over very often and see you, Jessop, and tell you all the  news,\" consoled Mavis.    \"I'll always be glad to welcome you and Miss Merle whenever you come. Let  me know beforehand if you can, and I'll make you crumpets for your tea.  You always like my crumpets!\"    \"Nobody else in the world knows how to make them properly,\" Merle assured  her. \"Those heavy things with holes in them that they sell in the shops  simply aren't fit to be called by the same name!\"    With Mother in the background to consult about matters of difficulty  school seemed much easier, though not altogether without thorns. Last  summer term Merle had considered herself the chosen chum of Iva Westwood,  but now Iva had completely fallen into the arms of Kitty Trefyre. As they  were both boarders and in the same dormitory, it was perhaps only natural  they should be friends, yet it is never nice to be dropped, and Merle  thought hard things of Iva. If she could have kept her feelings locked in  her own breast it would not have mattered so much, but she was a true  daughter of Jupiter, and, when provoked, could not refrain from shooting  her arrows of bitter words. They quarrelled about the silliest trifles:  the loan of an indiarubber, the loss of a pencil, or some slight  differences of opinion, over which they would argue hotly. It was a pity,  for at bottom Iva was a nice girl, and was merely passing through a phase  from which she would probably soon have recovered if Merle would only  have let her alone. On her side she might very well have contended that  it is hard to be pinned to a single chum, and that she was perfectly at  liberty to make fresh friends if she wished without of necessity giving  offence to the old ones by so doing.    \"Merle's so jealous!\" she complained. \"Why should she care? I'm sure I  don't mind her walking about the school arm-in-arm with Beata Castleton!\"    That, however, was exactly the point. Merle wanted Iva to mind, and was  extremely annoyed because the incident left her unruffled.    One afternoon, in the musical appreciation class, the two had partly  patched up past squabbles, and, for a wonder, were sitting side by side.  The subject was 'Handel,' and for one of the illustrations Miss Mitchell  called upon Merle to play the celebrated 'Largo.' She went through her  performance quite creditably, took her music, and turned from the piano.  Then she saw that during her absence Kitty had commandeered her seat next  to Iva. For a moment Merle stood with a look of the blankest  consternation, not knowing where to go, till Mavis beckoned and made a  place for her, into which she thankfully slipped, squeezing her sister's  hand surreptitiously, and feeling there was no friend in all the world so  staunch as Mavis.    \"If you wouldn't worry so over everybody, you'd get on better, dear!\"  advised the latter.    \"I can't help caring! I wasn't born calm. It all matters so very much to  me! What's the use of anything unless you care? You'd better swop me for  a nice, little, tame, harmless sister guaranteed never to squabble even  if people pull her hair, and always content to sit in the background  everywhere!\"    \"She'd be very uninteresting!\" laughed Mavis, bestowing a kiss upon  Merle's apple cheek. \"I think I prefer to keep you, thanks!\"    \"Thunderstorms and all?\"    \"So long as they clear the air, certainly! But we expect to have sunshine  afterwards, please!\"    Miss Mitchell intended to wind up her course of lessons on musical  appreciation with a concert among the pupils, and certain of them had  been bidden to play or sing. Naturally those on whom the choice fell went  through agonies in the matter of practising. After hearing so much about  great composers and the proper interpretation of their works, it seemed  almost a liberty for schoolgirls to venture to give their rendering, and  all felt that their performances would be subjected to decided criticism.    \"It's the audience that will make me nervous!\" fluttered Merle. \"If I  could play my piece when I'm alone and in the right mood and get a  gramophone record taken of it that could be put on at the concert, I  shouldn't mind. It would be rather fun sitting in a corner and listening  to my own playing. Something like seeing my own ghost, wouldn't it?\"    Mavis, Merle, Muriel, and Edith were all down for piano solos, Beata was  to bring her violin, and Nesta, Iva, and Kitty were to sing. They would  all do their best, but none had reached a very high level in the matter  of attainment. Miss Mitchell, with memories of the splendid talent  mustered at St. Cyprian's College in her own schooldays, felt that the  concert would be a most modest affair.    \"I wish we could get one or two good performers to come and help us!\" she  suggested.    \"Durracombe isn't at all a musical place,\" admitted Miss Fanny. \"There  really isn't anybody whom we could ask. Mrs. Carey used to play, but  she's out of practice and I'm sure she wouldn't venture before a roomful  of schoolgirls.\"    \"It would be rather an ordeal, I own.\"    About ten days before the event was to take place Muriel Burnitt had a  tea-party at her own home to which she invited Miss Fanny, Miss Mitchell,  and the elder boarders, asked them to bring their music, and went through  all the programme of the little concert. It, in fact, answered the  purpose of a dress rehearsal.    Mavis and Merle had not been included in the invitation and they were  very much hurt.    \"Muriel asked Beata, only she couldn't come. I know because Romola told  me so. She even asked Babbie Williams!\"    [Illustration: SHE HAD BROUGHT HER WONDERFUL STRADIVARIUS VIOLIN]    \"It's most mean of her to miss us out!\"    \"When we're playing solos, too!\"    The boarders talked tremendously about the pleasant evening they had had,  and how very much they had enjoyed themselves.    \"Muriel's aunt will be staying with her next week, and she's going to  persuade her to sing at the concert!\" said Iva. \"She has a beautiful  voice, and it will give things such a lift. Miss Mitchell is as pleased  as Punch about it, and says that's just what we want. We ought to have  one or two musical stars to make it go.\"    Muriel, who felt she had scored by securing a singer, took up a rather  lofty attitude and made herself so objectionable that Merle raved in  private, and even gentle Mavis was ruffled. They poured out their  grievances at home.    \"What's the date of the concert?\" asked Mrs. Ramsay. \"The 17th? Well, I  have an idea! No! I don't mean to tell you now in case my scheme doesn't  come off.\"    \"What is it, Mummie? I'm curious.\"    \"That's my secret! Take my advice and don't worry any more about Muriel.  Things will probably turn out even in the end.\"    In spite of coaxing Mother refused to explain herself further, and it was  only when a few days had gone by, and they had almost forgotten the  incident, that one morning she opened a letter, read it, and clapped her  hands in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#14)"],[1," a long line of Kabbalists, beginning with  Nachmanides and Moses de Leon, the compiler of the Zohar, and ending  with the anonymous authors of the mysterious \"Kana and Pelia.\"    The times grew less and less propitious. Catholicism steadily gained  ground in Spain. The scowling Dominican put forward his claim upon the  Jewish soul with vehement emphasis, and made every effort to drag it  into the bosom of the alone-saving Church. The conversion of the Jews  would have been a great triumph, indeed, for Catholicism militant. The  conversion methods of the Dominican monk were of a most insinuating  kind--he usually began with a public religious disputation.  Unfortunately, the Jews were experts in the art of debate, and too  often by their bold replies covered the self-sufficient dignitaries of  Rome with confusion. The Jews should have known, from bitter  experience, that such boldness would not be passed over silently. From  sumptuous debating hall to Dominican prison and scaffold was but a  short step. In 1391, one of these worthy soul-catchers, Bishop  Ferdinando Martinez, set the fanatical mob of Seville on the Jews, and  not without success. Terrorized by the threat of death, many accepted  Catholicism under duress. But they became Christians only in  appearance; in reality they remained true to the faith of their  fathers, and, in secret, running the risk of loss of life, they  fulfilled all the Jewish ordinances. This is the prologue to the  thrilling Marrano tragedy.    Finally, the moment approached when gloomy Catholicism attained to  unchallenged supremacy in the Pyrenean Peninsula. On the ruins of the  enlightened culture of the Arabs, Ferdinand the Catholic and Isabella  of Castile reared the reactionary government of medieval Rome. The  Inquisition was introduced (1480). Torquemada presided as high priest  over the rites attending the human sacrifices. _Ad gloriam  ecclesiae_, the whole of Spain was illuminated. Everywhere the  funeral pyres of the Inquisition flared to the skies, the air was rent  by the despairing shrieks of martyrs enveloped in flames or racked by  tortures, the prisons overflowed with Marranos,--all instruments of  torture were vigorously plied.    At last the hour of redemption struck: in 1492 all Jews were driven  from Spain, and a few years later from Portugal. Jewish-Arabic culture  after five centuries of ascendency suffered a sudden collapse. The  unhappy people again grasped its staff, and wandered forth into the  world without knowing whither.          X    THE RABBINIC-MYSTICAL PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE GERMAN-POLISH  JEWS (1492-1789)      The expulsion from Spain was a stunning blow. The hoary martyr people  which had defied so many storms in its long life was for a moment  dazed. The soil of Europe was quaking under its feet. At the time when  the medieval period had formally come to a close for Occidental  Christendom, and the modern period had opened, the middle ages  continued in unmitigated brutality for the Jews. If anything, the life  of the Jews had become more unendurable than before. What, indeed, had  the much-vaunted modern age to offer them? In the ranks of the  humanistic movement Reuchlin alone stood forth prominently as the  advocate of the Jews, and he was powerless before the prejudices of  the populace. The Reformation in Germany and elsewhere had illuminated  the minds of the people, but had not softened their hearts. Luther  himself, the creator of the Reformation, was not innocent of hating  the followers of an alien faith. The Jews especially did not enjoy too  great a measure of his sympathies. The wars growing out of the  Reformation, which in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  devastated Europe in the name of religion, were not calculated to  favor the spread of tolerance and milder manners. The conflict raging  in the bosom of the Church and setting her own children by the ears,  was yet insufficient to divert her maternal care from her  \"unbelieving\" stepchildren. In Spain and Portugal, stakes continued to  burn two centuries longer for the benefit of the Marranos, the false  Christians. In Germany and Austria, the Jews were kept in the same  condition of servitude as before. Their economic circumstances were  appalling. They were forced to emigrate _en masse_ to Poland,  which offered the adherents of their faith a comparatively quiet life,  and by and by was invested with the Jewish hegemony. Some of the  smaller states and independent towns of Italy also afforded the Jews  an asylum, though one not always to be depended upon. A group of  hard-driven Spanish exiles, for instance, under the leadership of  Abarbanel had found peace in Italy. The rest had turned to Turkey and  her province Palestine,    For a time, indeed, the Jewish spiritual centre was located in Turkey.  What Europe, old, Christian, and hardhearted, refused the Jews, was  granted them by Turkey, young, Mussulman, and liberal. On hearing of  the banishment of the Jews from Spain, Sultan Bajazet exclaimed: \"How  can you call Ferdinand of Aragon a wise king, the same Ferdinand who  has made his land poor and enriched ours?\" His amazement characterizes  the relation of Turkey to the Jews of the day. The one-time Marrano,  Joseph Nassi, rose to be a considerable dignitary at the court of  Sultan Selim (1566-1580). Occasionally he succeeded, by diplomatic  means, in wreaking vengeance upon European courts in retaliation for  the brutal tortures inflicted upon his people. With the generosity of  a Maecenas, he assembled Jewish scholars and poets, and surrounded  himself with a sunlit atmosphere of intellectuality and talent. All  other Jewish communities looked up to that of Constantinople. Now and  again its rabbis played the part of Patriarchs of the synagogue. To  this commanding position the rabbis of Palestine especially were  inclined to lay claim. They even attempted to restore the  Patriarchate, and the famous controversy between Jacob Berab and Levi  ben Chabib regarding the _Semicha_ is another evidence of the  same assertive tendency. Among the Spanish exiles settled in the Holy  Land a peculiar spiritual current set in. The storm-tossed wanderers,  but now returned to their native Jordan from the shores of the  blood-stained Tagus and Guadalquivir, were mightily moved at the sight  of their ancestral home. Ahasuerus, who on his thorn-strewn pilgrim's  path had drained the cup of woe to the dregs, suddenly caught sight of  the home of his childhood razed level with the ground. The precious,  never-to-be-forgotten ruins exhaled the home feeling, which took  possession of him with irresistible charm. Into his soul there flowed  sweet memories of a golden youth, past beyond recall. The impact of  these emotions enkindled passionate \"longing for Zion\" in the heart of  the forlorn, homeless martyr. He was seized by torturing thirst for  political resurrection. Such melancholy feelings and vehement  outbursts found expression in the practical Kabbala, originating with  Ari (Isaac Luria) and his famous Safed school. A mystical belief in  the coming of Messiah thenceforward became one of the essential  elements of the Jewish spirit. It vanquished the heart of the learned  Joseph Karo, who had brought Rabbinism to its climax by the  compilation of his celebrated ritual code, the Shulchan Aruch. With  equal force it dominated the being of Solomon Molcho, the enthusiastic  youth who, at one time a Marrano, on his public return to Judaism  proclaimed the speedy regeneration of Israel. He sealed his faith in  his prophecy with death at the stake (1532). The Marranos beyond the  Pyrenees and the unfortunate Jews of Italy, who, in the second half of  the sixteenth century had to bear the brunt of papal fanaticism, on  the increase since the Reformation, were kept in a state of constant  excitement by this Messianic doctrine, with its obscure stirrings of  hope. A mournful national feeling pervades the Jewish literature of  the time. Recollections of torments endured enflamed all hearts. A  series of chronicles were thus produced that record the centuries of  Jewish martyrdom--_Jocha-sin, Shebet Jehuda, Emek ha-Bacha_, etc.  The art of printing, even then developed to a considerable degree of  perfection, became for the dispersed Jews the strongest bond of  spiritual union. The papal _index librorum prohibitorum_ was  impotent in the face of the all-pervading propaganda for thought and  feeling carried on by the printing press.    After Palestine and Turkey, Holland for a time became the spiritual  centre of the scattered Jews (in the seventeenth century). Holland was  warmly attached to the cause of liberty. When it succeeded in freeing  itself from the clutches of fanatical Spain and her rapacious king,  Philip II, it inaugurated the golden era of liberty of conscience, of  peaceful development in culture and industry, and granted an asylum to  the persecuted and abandoned of all countries. By the thousands the  harassed Ghetto sons, especially the Marranos from Spain and Portugal,  migrated to Holland. Amsterdam became a second Cordova. The  intellectual life was quickened. Freedom from restraint tended to  break down the national exclusivism of the Jew, and intercourse with  his liberal surroundings varied his mental pursuits. Rabbinism, the  Kabbala, philosophy, national poetry--they all had their prominent  representatives in Holland. These manifold tendencies were united in  the literary activity of Manasseh ben Israel, a scholar of extensive,  though not intensive, encyclopedic attainments. Free thought and  religious rationalism were embodied in Uriel Acosta. To a still higher  degree they were illustrated in the theory of life expounded by the  immortal author of the \"Theologico-Political Tractate\" (1640-1677).  This advanced state of culture in Holland did not fail to react upon  the neighboring countries. Under the impulse of enthusiasm for the  Bible"]]]
