Following a brief religious ceremony, the skeletonized bodies were  lowered into common graves. On rainy days the graves filled with  water; it became necessary to hold the bodies down the poles, while  dirt was shoveled on to them. Sometimes the rain would uncover an arm  or leg; then animals ate away the flesh.      BOOT HILL *      No monuments nor flowers there amid the fields of cane,    No birds their song to fill the air, No trees to shield the rain.      We've watched these things through tear-dimmed eyes,    We've felt a sense of shame,    But now we see as time goes by,    We are really not to blame.      No, it's surely not the best,    No glory does it claim,    It's just the place where we laid them to rest,    Our friends who lost the game.                                    Chapter VI                             JAPANESE ATROCITIES      The Japanese were a proud people, regarding themselves as descendants  of the gods, a superior race, destined to bring light into a darkened  world. Should any wicked nation dare to impede or to obstruct their  Emperor in carrying out his celestial undertakings, Japan would  fight-by the command of the Japanese gods to reunite all nations under  the rule of the Japanese Emperor.    The Imperial Rescript of the Emperor to his military powers included  the following statement: \"Should any emergency arise, \"Boot hills were  at Camps O'Donnell & Cabanatuan, written by Ed \"Tommie\" Thomas while  in the hospital at Cabanatuan with diphtheria. The burial details went  by the barracks each morning as he watched, wondering if he would be  on one of those litters the next morning.    offer yourself courageously to the state, and thus regard to maintain  the prosperity of our Imperial Throne, Coeval with Heaven and Earth.\"    As late as 1877, the ancient custom of making trophies of the heads of  the enemy soldiers was still in effect in Japan.    Japan violated the Geneva Convention in 1931 when she invaded  Manchuria, and again in 1937 when she invaded China both without a  declaration of war. The world shouldn't have been surprised when the  Japanese bombers made their sudden attack on Pearl Harbor without a  declaration of War, further violating the Articles of Code 1929.  Actually, the Japanese had never approved the Geneva Convention,  either in theory or in practice, especially concerning P.O. W. s.    To the Japanese, surrender was a violation of military morality. In  any defeat, a loyal Japanese soldier would commit hari kiri.    Discipline in the Imperial Army was enforced by frequent slapping,  beating and kicking of junior officers and enlisted men for rather  minor offenses. For serious crimes, discipline was more complex. The  victim could be turned over to a Judo expert for suitable punishment.  He could be given the water treatment. He could be tied to a fence  post, and slapped beaten or kicked by each passing soldier. He could  be used for bayonet practice by recruits. Severe crimes called for an  officer to unsheathe his samurai sword and behead the criminal. The  head was displayed to others, tied to a bamboo pole, so the observer  would learn that crime does not pay. Enlisted men with little or no  rank, had no one to slap, beat or kick, so a captured enemy filled an  important gap in their system. In the minds of the Japanese, they  were. Not barbarians or savages, but merely loyal and patriotic  personnel administering a just punishment to those who dared to defy  authority, the Emperor or the Gods.    Atrocities were committed on many work details, including the farm.  Some were for the punishment of rather minor rules and others were for  the amusement of the guards, who enjoyed watching the Americans  performing super Herculean tasks.    Once a month, I had to carry hundred pound sacks of rice from the gate  to mess halls. This could have been easily accomplished by carts, but  the Japanese thought that the Americans should \"pay the price!\" As a  result I developed three hernias, which became a considerable handicap  in completing my tour with \"the Sons of Heaven.\"    The Japanese seemed very little concerned that more Americans and  Filipinos died as their prisoners, on the \"Death March,\" in prison  camps, on labor details, hell ships, and working in coal mines and  munitions factories, than died at the hands of the Japanese on the  battlefields. Those of us, who were guests of the Nipponese Emperor,  have little doubt that some of the treachery was learned from the  German Kulture.    We, who were captives and prisoners of the Japanese, will never be  able to forgive them, but knowing their background did help to explain  some of their vicious actions. However, it did not make their  barbarous, brutal, cruel savagery any easier to endure.    Very few ex-P.O.W.s will ever drive Toyotas, Datsuns or Mazdas.                              Chapter VII AMERICANS!      We kept getting reports on our little radio that MacArthur was winning  battles in many places, some of which we'd never heard of:    March, 1944 - Palau;    April - Hollandia;    June - Saipan.    In July, we heard that MacArthur met Roosevelt in Hawaii, and that he  was finally able to convince the President that it was necessary to  take the Philippines in order to have a base from which to attack  Japan.       In August it was reported that 30,000 Japs had been killed don't  know where.         .       September 15, 1944: Two-hundred aircraft had bombed Cebu, Negros  and Panay.       U.S. Navy Dive-Bombers! On Sept. 21-suddenly-out of a clear blue  sky-some thousand planes flew over camp from the east-they had to be  carrier planes. They continued west to an hour. Then the planes  returned coming down low over camp.    We could make out U.S. Navy markings on them. The Jap guards were all  crouching down in foxholes.    \"Don't lose your head now! Don't show any emotion! The Nips are all  trigger-happy, just waiting for an incident to happen    before shooting up the camp.\"    A big Jap bomber tried to sneak off the local airfield that we had  built with prisoner labor. It was flying low-barely over the treetops.  A Navy dive bomber saw it, dropped down right over it and strafed it  with incendiaries. In seconds there was a big explosion and tremendous  orange flames as the bomber plowed into the ground. This was followed  by billows of black smoke lasting several hours.    It was a great show! It was tough trying to repress our elation. There  was no food served that day - a typical Japanese reaction.    We all believed that freedom must be close that the Americans would be  making landings soon. That night morale was high; the camp literally  buzzed with rumors. A few Navy planes appeared almost daily.    October, 1944: MacArthur invaded Leyte producing 100,000 Japanese  casualties. The attitude of the Nip guards changed very markedly; they  lost the arrogance they had when they were winning the battles; some  became sadistic; some became friendly.    A big Jap \"shakedown.\" Every prisoner had to display all his  possessions. Japs picked up all mosquito netting and tropical helmets,  saying, \"You vill not need these in Japan! You vill be sent to Japan!\"    The camp began to buzz with rumors again. U.S. Medical officers were  ordered to examine all prisoners to determine the ones well enough to  make a trip to Japan and the ones too disabled to travel. The Japanese  did not want any amoebic dysentery cases in Japan. Suddenly, there was  a new commodity \"warm stools.\" Prisoners, who feared a \"hell ship\"  cruise to Japan, bartered for a \"hot specimen\" from a known amoebic to  present to the laboratory for examination hoping against hope, that it  would be \"positive.\"    Japan Detail: Before our Japan Detail departed for Manila, I asked  Major Stephen Sitter, the camp psychiatrist, \"Why is it that very few  of the 12,000 prisoners spending time in the Cabanatuan camp ever made  any attempt to take their own lives when they were starving, suffering  from many diseases and were frequently in unpleasant and uncomfortable  situations?\"       He answered, \"They were all too busy figuring out ways to survive;  they didn't have time to think about suicide.\"       Between October 21 and 27, about 1600 prisoners, the Japan    Detail, were loaded on trucks to be delivered to the old Spanish  prison in Manila-Bilibid. Before leaving, several of us prisoners  buried diaries, notes, sketches, etc., near the buildings in which we  lived, hoping to retrieve them after the war. My 110 sketches were  placed in a Mason jar and buried near Bldg. #12. On our way to Manila,  our truck had to stop frequently under big trees-to hide from the  numerous U.S. planes passing overhead.    Cabanatuan Rescue: After the exodus of the Japan Detail (the so-called  healthy prisoners) in late October, there were only 511 unhealthy  prisoners remaining in camp.    Things were rather quiet until about 2000 hours on January 30, 1945,  when sudden gunfire from outside the camp wiped out all of the  Japanese guards in the towers. It was MacArthur's 6th Ranger Battalion  under the command of Lt. Col. Henry Mucci - aided by guerrillas -  walking into camp. They quickly obtained carabao carts and sleds for  the bedridden prisoners.    That evening 511 internees were moved many miles down the road to the  west in the moonlight with hardly a shot fired. Early the next morning  they arrived at a transportation center, where prisoners were placed  aboard trucks and ambulances and taken to Lingayen Gulf; then they  were transferred to planes and flown to Manila. After suffering from  more than three years of intentional neglect by the Japanese Imperial  Army, they were finally \"free men.\"    No prisoners were lost in the operation; there were two casualties  among the Rangers: Capt. James Fischer, the doctor, was killed by  mortar fire"]]]
