I am sorry that I am obliged to give you so much  trouble, but I hope you are very well assured that I am grateful for what  you have done for me, and I leave you to judge of my present wretched  case. I am, and shall for ever continue, dear Chief, your own to command,  Jas. MacGregor.    \"P. S.--If you'd send your pipes by the bearer, and all the other little  trinkims belonging to it, I would put them in order, and play some  melancholy tunes, which I may now with safety, and in real truth. Forgive  my not going directly to you, for if I could have borne the seeing of  yourself, I could not choose to be seen by my friends in my wretchedness,  nor by any of my acquaintance.\"    While MacGregor wrote in this disconsolate manner, Death, the sad but  sure remedy for mortal evils, and decider of all doubts and  uncertainties, was hovering near him. A memorandum on the back of the  letter says the writer died about a week after, in October 1754.    It now remains to mention the fate of Robin Oig--for the other sons of  Rob Roy seem to have been no way distinguished. Robin was apprehended by  a party of military from the fort of Inversnaid, at the foot of Gartmore,  and was conveyed to Edinburgh 26th May 1753. After a delay, which may  have been protracted by the negotiations of James for delivering up Allan  Breck Stewart upon promise of his brother's life, Robin Oig, on the 24th  of December 1753, was brought to the bar of the High Court of Justiciary,  and indicted by the name of Robert MacGregor, alias Campbell, alias  Drummond, alias Robert Oig; and the evidence led against him resembled  exactly that which was brought by the Crown on the former trial. Robert's  case was in some degree more favourable than his brother's;--for, though  the principal in the forcible marriage, he had yet to plead that he had  shown symptoms of relenting while they were carrying Jean Key off, which  were silenced by the remonstrances and threats of his harder natured  brother James. A considerable space of time had also elapsed since the  poor woman died, which is always a strong circumstance in favour of the  accused; for there is a sort of perspective in guilt, and crimes of an  old date seem less odious than those of recent occurrence. But  notwithstanding these considerations, the jury, in Robert's case, did not  express any solicitude to save his life as they had done that of James.  They found him guilty of being art and part in the forcible abduction of  Jean Key from her own dwelling.*    * The Trials of the Sons of Rob Roy, with anecdotes of Himself and his  Family, were published at Edinburgh, 1818, in 12mo.    Robin Oig was condemned to death, and executed on the 14th February 1754.  At the place of execution he behaved with great decency; and professing  himself a Catholic, imputed all his misfortunes to his swerving from the  true church two or three years before. He confessed the violent methods  he had used to gain Mrs. Key, or Wright, and hoped his fate would stop  further proceedings against his brother James.*    * James died near three months before, but his family might easily remain  a long time without the news of that event.    The newspapers observed that his body, after hanging the usual time, was  delivered to his friends to be carried to the Highlands. To this the  recollection of a venerable friend, recently taken from us in the fulness  of years, then a schoolboy at Linlithgow, enables the author to add, that  a much larger body of MacGregors than had cared to advance to Edinburgh  received the corpse at that place with the coronach and other wild  emblems of Highland mourning, and so escorted it to Balquhidder. Thus we  may conclude this long account of Rob Roy and his family with the classic  phrase,                              Ite. Conclamatum est.    I have only to add, that I have selected the above from many anecdotes of  Rob Roy which were, and may still be, current among the mountains where  he flourished; but I am far from warranting their exact authenticity.  Clannish partialities were very apt to guide the tongue and pen, as well  as the pistol and claymore, and the features of an anecdote are  wonderfully softened or exaggerated as the story is told by a MacGregor  or a Campbell.          APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.      No. I.--ADVERTISEMENT  FOR THE APPREHENSION OF ROB ROY.    (From the Edinburgh Evening Courant, June 18 to June 21, A.D. 1732. No.  1058.)    \"That Robert Campbell, commonly known by the name of Rob Roy MacGregor,  being lately intrusted by several noblemen and gentlemen with  considerable sums for buying cows for them in the Highlands, has  treacherously gone off with the money, to the value of L1000 sterling,  which he carries along with him. All Magistrates and Officers of his  Majesty's forces are intreated to seize upon the said Rob Roy, and the  money which he carries with him, until the persons concerned in the money  be heard against him; and that notice be given, when he is apprehended,  to the keepers of the Exchange Coffee-house at Edinburgh, and the keeper  of the Coffee-house at Glasgow, where the parties concerned will be  advertised, and the seizers shall be very reasonably rewarded for their  pains.\"    It is unfortunate that this Hue and Cry, which is afterwards repeated in  the same paper, contains no description of Rob Roy's person, which, of  course, we must suppose to have been pretty generally known. As it is  directed against Rob Roy personally, it would seem to exclude the idea of  the cattle being carried off by his partner, MacDonald, who would  certainly have been mentioned in the advertisement, if the creditors  concerned had supposed him to be in possession of the money.          No. II.--LETTERS  FROM AND TO THE DUKE OF MONTROSE  RESPECTING ROB ROY'S ARREST OF MR. GRAHAME OF KILLEARN.    _The Duke of Montrose to--_*    * It does not appear to whom this letter was addressed. Certainly, from  its style and tenor, It was designed for some person high in rank and  office--perhaps the King's Advocate for the time.      \"Glasgow, the 21st November, 1716.    \"My Lord,--I was surprised last night with the account of a very  remarkable instance of the insolence of that very notorious rogue Rob  Roy, whom your lordship has often heard named. The honour of his  Majesty's Government being concerned in it, I thought it my duty to  acquaint your lordship of the particulars by an express.    \"Mr. Grahame of Killearn (whom I have had occasion to mention frequently  to you, for the good service he did last winter during the rebellion)  having the charge of my Highland estate, went to Monteath, which is a  part of it, on Monday last, to bring in my rents, it being usual for him  to be there for two or three nights together at this time of the year, in  a country house, for the conveniency of meeting the tenants, upon that  account. The same night, about 9 of the clock, Rob Roy, with a party of  those ruffians whom he has still kept about him since the late rebellion,  surrounded the house where Mr. Grahame was with some of my tenants doing  his business, ordered his men to present their guns in att the windows of  the room where he was sitting, while he himself at the same time with  others entered at the door, with cocked pistols, and made Mr. Grahame  prisoner, carrying him away to the hills with the money he had got, his  books and papers, and my tenants' bonds for their fines, amounting to  above a thousand pounds sterling, whereof the one-half had been paid last  year, and the other was to have been paid now; and att the same time had  the insolence to cause him to write a letter to me (the copy of which is  enclosed) offering me terms of a treaty.    \"That your Lordship may have the better view of this matter, it will be  necessary that I should inform you, that this fellow has now, of a long  time, put himself at the head of the Clan M'Gregor, a race of people who  in all ages have distinguished themselves beyond others, by robberies,  depredations, and murders, and have been the constant harbourers and  entertainers of vagabonds and loose people. From the time of the  Revolution he has taken every opportunity to appear against the  Government, acting rather as a robber than doing any real service to  those whom he pretended to appear for, and has really done more mischief  to the countrie than all the other Highlanders have done.    \"Some three or four years before the last rebellion broke out, being  overburdened with debts, he quitted his ordinary residence, and removed  some twelve or sixteen miles farther into the Highlands, putting himself  under the protection of the Earl of Bredalbin. When my Lord Cadogan was  in the Highlands, he ordered his house att this place to be burnt, which  your Lordship sees he now places to my account.    \"This obliges him to return to the same countrie he went from, being a  most rugged inaccessible place, where he took up his residence anew  amongst his own friends and relations; but well judging that it was  possible to surprise him, he, with about forty-five of his followers,  went to Inverary, and made a sham surrender of their arms to Coll.  Campbell of Finab, Commander of one of the Independent Companies, and  returned home with his men, each of them having the Coll.'s protection.  This happened in the beginning of summer last; yet not long after he  appeared with his men twice in arms, in opposition to the King's troops:  and one of those times attackt them, rescued a prisoner from them, and  all this while sent abroad his party through the countrie, plundering the  countrie people, and amongst the rest some of my tenants.    \"Being informed of these disorders after I came to Scotland, I applied to  Lieut.-Genll. Carpenter, who ordered three parties from Glasgow,  Stirling, and Finlarig, to march in the night by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#14)"],[1," \"It is truly a  wonderful record! Would we had more like her. Why do we not help the  children to get saved, letting them feel that they are really one with  us? We need their help fully as much as they need ours. 'Take heed that  ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in  heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in  Heaven.'\"    --L. C. W. _Copyright by B. Wood_, 1895.        A CHILD'S FAITH    Johnny Hall was a poor boy. His mother worked hard for their daily bread.  \"Please give me something to eat, for I am very hungry,\" he said to her  one evening.    His mother let the work that she was sewing fall upon her knees, and  drew Johnny toward her. As she kissed him the tears fell fast on his  face, while she said, \"Johnny, my dear, I have not a penny in the world.  There is not a morsel of bread in the house, and I cannot give you any  tonight.\"    Johnny did not cry when he heard this. He was only a little fellow but  he had learned the lesson of trusting in God's promises. He had great  faith in the sweet words of Jesus when he said, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask  the Father in my name he will give it you.\"    \"Never mind, mama; I shall soon be asleep, and then I shall not feel  hungry. But you must sit here and sew, hungry and cold. Poor mama!\" he  said, as he threw his arms around her neck and kissed her many times to  comfort her.    Then he knelt down at his mother's knee to say his prayers after her.  They said \"Our Father,\" till they came to the petition, \"Give us this  day our daily bread.\" The way in which his mother said these words made  Johnny's heart ache. He stopped and looked at her, and repeated with his  eyes full of tears. \"Give us this day our daily bread.\"    [Illustration.]    When they got through he looked at his mother and said, \"Now mother, do  not be afraid. We shall never be hungry any more. God is our Father. He  has promised to hear us, and I am sure he will.\"    Then he went to bed. Before midnight he woke up, while his mother was  still at work, and asked if the bread had come yet. She said \"No; but I  am sure it will come.\"    In the morning, before Johnny was awake, a gentleman called who wanted  his mother to come to his house and take charge of his two motherless  children. She agreed to go. He left some money with her. She went out  at once to buy some things for breakfast; and when Johnny awoke, the  bread was there, and all that he needed!    Johnny is now a man, but he has never wanted bread from that day; and  whenever he was afraid since then, he has remembered God's promises, and  trusted in him.    --_Lutheran Herald_        TRIUMPHANT DEATH OF A LITTLE CHILD    Some years ago we knew a Brother and Sister G----, who told of the  remarkable experience of their little girl, only seven years old, who  had a short time ago gone home to heaven. The parents were devoted  Christians who had taught their children to love and honor God. During  little Ella's illness she manifested wonderful patience and told of her  love for Jesus. The morning she died she called her papa and mama to her  side and said: \"I have been in heaven all night. My room is full of  angels and Jesus is here. I'm going to heaven.\" Then she asked them to  promise to meet her there. As soon as they could control their feelings  they made her the promise. Then she kissed them and called for her little  brother and sister and other friends. She talked with each one in turn,  telling them in substance, the same she had told her papa and mama,  asking each one to make her the same promise, and kissing each one  good-bye. That was a touching scene. Those who were there said it seemed  more like heaven than earth to be in her presence. In the midst of many  tears all promised her they would surely meet her in that bright and  beautiful home to which she was going. Just before she died she asked  her mama to dress her in white and also to dress her doll in white and  put it by her side in her coffin. Then she folded her own little hands  and closed her eyes and said, \"Jesus is calling me and I must go now.  Good-bye,\" and she was gone.    Little Ella's death was glorious and she is not the only one that has  left us such bright, joyous testimony. We have ourselves known of many  children and older ones who had quite similar experiences. And though  we may not all see, before we die, all that Ella saw, if we love Jesus  and do what he asks us to, he will surely fulfill to each of us his  promise: \"I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a  place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where  I am, there you may be also.\"    --Editor    [Illustration: \"I have been in heaven all night. My room is full of  angels and Jesus is here.\"]        THE CHILD'S PRAYER      [Illustration.]      Into her chamber went    A little girl one day,    And by a chair she knelt,    And thus began to pray:--      \"Jesus, my eyes I close,    Thy form I cannot see;    If Thou art near me, Lord,    I pray Thee to speak to me.\"      A still, small voice she heard within her soul--    \"What is it child? I hear thee; tell the whole.\"      \"I pray thee, Lord,\" she said,    \"That Thou wilt condescend    To tarry in my heart    And ever be my Friend.      \"The path of life is dark,    I would not go astray;    Oh, let me have Thy hand    To lead me in the way.\"      \"Fear not; I will not leave thee, child, alone.\"    She thought she felt a soft hand press her own.      \"They tell me, Lord, that all    The living pass away;    The aged soon must die,    And even children may.      \"Oh, let my parents live    Till I a woman grow;    For if they die, what can    A little orphan do?\"      \"Fear not, my child; whatever ill may come    I'll not forsake thee till I bring thee home.\"      Her little prayer was said,    And from her chamber now    She passed forth with the light    Of heaven upon her brow.      \"Mother, I've seen the Lord,    His hand in mine I felt,    And, oh, I heard Him say,    As by my chair I knelt--      \"'Fear not, my child; whatever ill may come    I'll not forsake thee till I bring thee home.'\"        THE CAT CAME BACK    Jimmy was lying on an old cot out in the orchard, getting some of the  nice spring sunshine on his thin body. There was an anxious frown on his  face now, and every little while he would turn on his side, look through  the orchard, and call \"Kittv kitty! kitty! Annette, Come, Ann-ette.\"    But Annette did not come. His mother came and reminded him that Annette  was very old indeed, and it might be that she would never come again.    \"She was here yesterday, Mother,\" he answered her, and the big tears  came to his eyes \"She felt perfectly fine then.\"    \"I know, but she's an old cat. She never strays away of her own accord,  and certainlv no one would steal an old blind cat.\"    Later on during the day a man came walking up to their house. He introduced  himself as the new neighbor who just moved across the little creek. He  made inquiries as to where he could buy fresh vegetables and milk. And  just as he was about to leave he remarked, \"I did a strange thing early  this morning. There was an old cat came over to my place. One ear was  almost gone and it was blind. I'm not much of a hand to make way with  things, but I felt so sorry for that poor old animal that I killed it.\"      \"Oh!\" With a strangled sob Jimmy quickly left the room.    His mother explained to the man it had been their old pet. He was very  sorry, but of course that did not bring the cat back.    \"When I saw it, I just banged it over the head with a stick and then  buried it. You will never know how badly I feel about it.\"    When he was gone, mother went out to find Jimmy and comfort him. He was  out in the orchard on his knees. Quietly she went up and knelt beside  him, slipping her arm about his shoulder.    He turned to her at once. \"Mother, there's something funny about Annette.  I've been praying and I feel all happy inside. It's just as if she wasn't  dead at all!\"    \"What would we ever do without our Comforter, son?\" she said. \"He does  help us bear our burdens in a wonderful way.\"    \"I'll say he does. This morning I felt so bad I didn't know what to do,  and then when that man said--he had killed Annette--I thought I just  could not stand it. And here I am happy as anything again. And just  because I took it all to Jesus. I think Annette is all right now.\"    \"She was very old, son. It wouldn't have been much longer anyway.  Why--why--Jimmy!\"    But Jimmy was running swiftly across the field toward an old blind cat  that was staggering in his direction.    Apparently the new neighbor had only stunned the cat and she had dug her  way out of the shallow hole and come home again.    It was years before she really died, and long before she presented Jimmy  with a very tiny kitten with two whole ears and two very bright eyes.    This story may sound strange to you, so perhaps I had better add that  it is really true.    --Mary M. Naylor.        HOW GOD ANSWERED DONALD'S PRAYER    God often uses children to win grown folks for Christ. Little children  not only have a deep faith but a childlike trust in believing that God  answers their prayers. \"All that ye ask in my name, _believing, that  ye shall receive_.\"    As a young girl, I went to Sunday School and learned about Jesus. Although  I knew about my Savior and what He had done to save me, yet I never  accepted Him as _my own Redeemer_ and Friend.    As years went by, I went into sin and shared in the common sins of worldly  people. I knew better than to do the things I did, but sin is a miry  clay pulling its victims down deeper and deeper. For ten years I never  entered a church house except to attend my father's funeral. I saw him  go into eternity without being able to point him to the \"Lamb of God  which taketh away the sin of the world.\"    During these years I had married and God had"]]]
