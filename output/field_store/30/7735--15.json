The whole party now drew round in a circle, and each related some  ghostly anecdote, heedless of the flight of time, till, in a pause of  the conversation, they heard the hollow tongue of midnight sounding  twelve.      MR HILARY    All these anecdotes admit of solution on psychological principles.  It is more easy for a soldier, a philosopher, or even a saint, to be  frightened at his own shadow, than for a dead man to come out of his  grave. Medical writers cite a thousand singular examples of the force  of imagination. Persons of feeble, nervous, melancholy temperament,  exhausted by fever, by labour, or by spare diet, will readily conjure  up, in the magic ring of their own phantasy, spectres, gorgons,  chimaeras, and all the objects of their hatred and their love. We  are most of us like Don Quixote, to whom a windmill was a giant, and  Dulcinea a magnificent princess: all more or less the dupes of our own  imagination, though we do not all go so far as to see ghosts, or to  fancy ourselves pipkins and teapots.      MR FLOSKY    I can safely say I have seen too many ghosts myself to believe in  their external existence. I have seen all kinds of ghosts: black  spirits and white, red spirits and grey. Some in the shapes of  venerable old men, who have met me in my rambles at noon; some  of beautiful young women, who have peeped through my curtains at  midnight.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    And have proved, I doubt not, 'palpable to feeling as to sight.'      MR FLOSKY    By no means, sir. You reflect upon my purity. Myself and my friends,  particularly my friend Mr Sackbut, are famous for our purity. No, sir,  genuine untangible ghosts. I live in a world of ghosts. I see a ghost  at this moment.      Mr Flosky fixed his eyes on a door at the farther end of the library.  The company looked in the same direction. The door silently opened,  and a ghastly figure, shrouded in white drapery, with the semblance  of a bloody turban on its head, entered and stalked slowly up the  apartment. Mr Flosky, familiar as he was with ghosts, was not prepared  for this apparition, and made the best of his way out at the opposite  door. Mrs Hilary and Marionetta followed, screaming. The Honourable Mr  Listless, by two turns of his body, rolled first off the sofa and  then under it. The Reverend Mr Larynx leaped up and fled with so much  precipitation, that he overturned the table on the foot of Mr Glowry.  Mr Glowry roared with pain in the ear of Mr Toobad. Mr Toobad's alarm  so bewildered his senses, that, missing the door, he threw up one of  the windows, jumped out in his panic, and plunged over head and ears  in the moat. Mr Asterias and his son, who were on the watch for their  mermaid, were attracted by the splashing, threw a net over him, and  dragged him to land.    Scythrop and Mr Hilary meanwhile had hastened to his assistance, and,  on arriving at the edge of the moat, followed by several servants with  ropes and torches, found Mr Asterias and Aquarius busy in endeavouring  to extricate Mr Toobad from the net, who was entangled in the meshes,  and floundering with rage. Scythrop was lost in amazement; but Mr  Hilary saw, at one view, all the circumstances of the adventure, and  burst into an immoderate fit of laughter; on recovering from which, he  said to Mr Asterias, 'You have caught an odd fish, indeed.' Mr Toobad  was highly exasperated at this unseasonable pleasantry; but Mr Hilary  softened his anger, by producing a knife, and cutting the Gordian knot  of his reticular envelopment. 'You see,' said Mr Toobad, 'you see,  gentlemen, in my unfortunate person proof upon proof of the present  dominion of the devil in the affairs of this world; and I have no  doubt but that the apparition of this night was Apollyon himself in  disguise, sent for the express purpose of terrifying me into this  complication of misadventures. The devil is come among you, having  great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.'           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER XIII      Mr Glowry was much surprised, on occasionally visiting Scythrop's  tower, to find the door always locked, and to be kept sometimes  waiting many minutes for admission: during which he invariably heard a  heavy rolling sound like that of a ponderous mangle, or of a waggon on  a weighing-bridge, or of theatrical thunder.    He took little notice of this for some time; at length his curiosity  was excited, and, one day, instead of knocking at the door, as usual,  the instant he reached it, he applied his ear to the key-hole, and  like Bottom, in the Midsummer Night's Dream, 'spied a voice,' which he  guessed to be of the feminine gender, and knew to be not Scythrop's,  whose deeper tones he distinguished at intervals. Having attempted in  vain to catch a syllable of the discourse, he knocked violently at  the door, and roared for immediate admission. The voices ceased, the  accustomed rolling sound was heard, the door opened, and Scythrop  was discovered alone. Mr Glowry looked round to every corner of the  apartment, and then said, 'Where is the lady?'    'The lady, sir?' said Scythrop.    'Yes, sir, the lady.'    'Sir, I do not understand you.'    'You don't, sir?'    'No, indeed, sir. There is no lady here.'    'But, sir, this is not the only apartment in the tower, and I make no  doubt there is a lady up stairs.'    'You are welcome to search, sir.'    'Yes, and while I am searching, she will slip out from some lurking  place, and make her escape.'    'You may lock this door, sir, and take the key with you.'    'But there is the terrace door: she has escaped by the terrace.'    'The terrace, sir, has no other outlet, and the walls are too high for  a lady to jump down.'    'Well, sir, give me the key.'    Mr Glowry took the key, searched every nook of the tower, and  returned.    'You are a fox, Scythrop; you are an exceedingly cunning fox, with  that demure visage of yours. What was that lumbering sound I heard  before you opened the door?'    'Sound, sir?'    'Yes, sir, sound.'    'My dear sir, I am not aware of any sound, except my great table,  which I moved on rising to let you in.'    'The table!--let me see that. No, sir; not a tenth part heavy enough,  not a tenth part.'    'But, sir, you do not consider the laws of acoustics: a whisper  becomes a peal of thunder in the focus of reverberation. Allow me to  explain this: sounds striking on concave surfaces are reflected from  them, and, after reflection, converge to points which are the foci of  these surfaces. It follows, therefore, that the ear may be so placed  in one, as that it shall hear a sound better than when situated nearer  to the point of the first impulse: again, in the case of two concave  surfaces placed opposite to each other--'    'Nonsense, sir. Don't tell me of foci. Pray, sir, will concave  surfaces produce two voices when nobody speaks? I heard two voices,  and one was feminine; feminine, sir: what say you to that?'    'Oh, sir, I perceive your mistake: I am writing a tragedy, and was  acting over a scene to myself. To convince you, I will give you a  specimen; but you must first understand the plot. It is a tragedy on  the German model. The Great Mogul is in exile, and has taken lodgings  at Kensington, with his only daughter, the Princess Rantrorina,  who takes in needlework, and keeps a day school. _The princess is  discovered hemming a set of shirts for the parson of the parish: they  are to be marked with a large R. Enter to her the Great Mogul. A  pause, during which they look at each other expressively. The  princess changes colour several times. The Mogul takes snuff in great  agitation. Several grains are heard to fall on the stage. His heart is  seen to beat through his upper benjamin._--THE MOGUL _(with a mournful  look at his left shoe_). 'My shoe-string is broken.'--THE PRINCESS  (_after an interval of melancholy reflection_). 'I know it.' THE  MOGUL. 'My second shoe-string! The first broke when I lost my empire:  the second has broken to-day. When will my poor heart break?'--THE  PRINCESS. 'Shoe-strings, hearts, and empires! Mysterious sympathy!'    'Nonsense, sir,' interrupted Mr Glowry. 'That is not at all like the  voice I heard.'    'But, sir,' said Scythrop, 'a key-hole may be so constructed as to act  like an acoustic tube, and an acoustic tube, sir, will modify sound in  a very remarkable manner. Consider the construction of the ear, and  the nature and causes of sound. The external part of the ear is a  cartilaginous funnel.'    'It wo'n't do, Scythrop. There is a girl concealed in this tower, and  find her I will. There are such things as sliding panels and secret  closets.'--He sounded round the room with his cane, but detected  no hollowness.--'I have heard, sir,' he continued, 'that during my  absence, two years ago, you had a dumb carpenter closeted with you  day after day. I did not dream that you were laying contrivances for  carrying on secret intrigues. Young men will have their way: I had my  way when I was a young man: but, sir, when your cousin Marionetta--'    Scythrop now saw that the affair was growing serious. To have clapped  his hand upon his father's mouth, to have entreated him to be silent,  would, in the first place, not have made him so; and, in the second,  would have shown a dread of being overheard by somebody. His only  resource, therefore, was to try to drown Mr Glowry's voice; and,  having no other subject, he continued his description of the ear,  raising his voice continually as Mr Glowry raised his.    'When your cousin Marionetta,' said Mr Glowry, 'whom you profess to  love--whom you profess to love, sir--'    'The internal canal of the ear,' said Scythrop, 'is partly bony and  partly cartilaginous. This internal canal is--'    'Is actually in the house, sir; and, when you are so shortly to be--as  I expect--'    'Closed at the further end by the _membrana"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#14)"],[1," thought. It made  him stand stiffer. His chin went up. He grew literally taller before  their eyes, and such a look came on his face that the sheriff  instinctively fell back a pace.    \"Mr. Gainor,\" said Terry, as though his contempt for the sheriff was too  great to permit his speaking directly to Minter, \"will you explain to the  sheriff that my determination to have satisfaction does not come from the  fact that he killed my father, but because of the manner of the killing?  To the sheriff it seems justifiable. To me it seems a murder. Having that  thought, there is only one thing to do. One of us must not leave this  place!\" Gainor bowed, but the sheriff gaped.    \"By the eternal!\" he scoffed. \"This sounds like one of them duels of the  old days. This was the way they used to talk!\"    \"Gentlemen,\" said Gainor, raising his long-fingered hand, \"it is my  solemn duty to admonish you to make up your differences amicably.\"    \"Whatever that means,\" sneered the sheriff. \"But tell this young fool  that's trying to act like he couldn't see me or hear me--tell him that I  don't carry no grudge ag'in' him, that I'm sorry he's Black Jack's son,  but that it's something he can live down, maybe. And I'll go so far as to  say I'm sorry that I done all that talking right to his face. But farther  than that I won't go. And if all this is leading up to a gunplay, by God,  gents, the minute a gun comes into my hand I shoot to kill, mark you  that, and don't you never forget it!\"    Mr. Gainor had remained with his hand raised during this outbreak. Now he  turned to Terry.    \"You have heard?\" he said. \"I think the sheriff is going quite a way  toward you, Mr. Colby.\"    \"Hollis!\" gasped Terry. \"Hollis is the name, sir!\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Gainor. \"Mr. Hollis it is! Gentlemen, I assure  you that I feel for you both. It seems, however, to be one of those  unfortunate affairs when the mind must stop its debate and physical  action must take up its proper place. I lament the necessity, but I admit  it, even though the law does not admit it. But there are unwritten laws,  sirs, unwritten laws which I for one consider among the holies of  holies.\"    Palpably the old man was enjoying every minute of his own talk. It was  not his first affair of this nature. He came out of an early and more  courtly generation where men drank together in the evening by firelight  and carved one another in the morning with glimmering bowie knives.    \"You are both,\" he protested, \"dear to me. I esteem you both as men and  as good citizens. And I have done my best to open the way for peaceful  negotiations toward an understanding. It seems that I have failed. Very  well, sirs. Then it must be battle. You are both armed? With revolvers?\"    \"Nacher'ly,\" said the sheriff, and spat accurately at a blaze on the tree  trunk beside him. He had grown very quiet.    \"I am armed,\" said Terry calmly, \"with a revolver.\"    \"Very good.\"    The hand of Gainor glided into his bosom and came forth bearing a white  handkerchief. His right hand slid into his coat and came forth likewise--  bearing a long revolver.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the first man to disobey my directions I shall  shoot down unquestioningly, like a dog. I give you my solemn word for  it!\"    And his eye informed them that he would enjoy the job.    He continued smoothly: \"This contest shall accord with the only terms by  which a duel with guns can be properly fought. You will stand back to  back with your guns not displayed, but in your clothes. At my word you  will start walking in the opposite directions until my command 'Turn!'  and at this command you will wheel, draw your guns, and fire until one  man falls--or both!\"    He sent his revolver through a peculiar, twirling motion and shook back  his long white hair.    \"Ready, gentlemen, and God defend the right!\"        CHAPTER 14      The talk was fitful in the living room. Elizabeth Cornish did her best to  revive the happiness of her guests, but she herself was a prey to the  same subdued excitement which showed in the faces of the others. A  restraint had been taken away by the disappearance of both the storm  centers of the dinner--the sheriff and Terry. Therefore it was possible  to talk freely. And people talked. But not loudly. They were prone to  gather in little familiar groups and discuss in a whisper how Terry had  risen and spoken before them. Now and then someone, for the sake of  politeness, strove to open a general theme of conversation, but it died  away like a ripple on a placid pond.    \"But what I can't understand,\" said Elizabeth to Vance when she was able  to maneuver him to her side later on, \"is why they seem to expect  something more.\"    Vance was very grave and looked tired. The realization that all his  cunning, all his work, had been for nothing, tormented him. He had set  his trap and baited it, and it had worked perfectly--save that the teeth  of the trap had closed over thin air. At the denouement of the sheriff's  story there should have been the barking of two guns and a film of  gunpowder smoke should have gone tangling to the ceiling. Instead there  had been the formal little speech from Terry--and then quiet. Yet he had  to mask and control his bitterness; he had to watch his tongue in talking  with his sister.    \"You see,\" he said quietly, \"they don't understand. They can't see how  fine Terry is in having made no attempt to avenge the death of his  father. I suppose a few of them think he's a coward. I even heard a  little talk to that effect!\"    \"Impossible!\" cried Elizabeth.    She had not thought of this phase of the matter. All at once she hated  the sheriff.    \"It really is possible,\" said Vance. \"You see, it's known that Terry  never fights if he can avoid it. There never has been any real reason for  fighting until today. But you know how gossip will put the most unrelated  facts together, and make a complete story in some way.\"    \"I wish the sheriff were dead!\" moaned Elizabeth. \"Oh, Vance, if you only  hadn't gone near Craterville! If you only hadn't distributed those  wholesale invitations!\"    It was almost too much for Vance--to be reproached after so much of the  triumph was on her side--such a complete victory that she herself would  never dream of the peril she and Terry had escaped. But he had to control  his irritation. In fact, he saw his whole life ahead of him carefully  schooled and controlled. He no longer had anything to sell. Elizabeth had  made a mock of him and shown him that he was hollow, that he was living  on her charity. He must all the days that she remained alive keep  flattering her, trying to find a way to make himself a necessity to her.  And after her death there would be a still harder task. Terry, who  disliked him pointedly, would then be the master, and he would face the  bitter necessity of cajoling the youngster whom he detested. A fine life,  truly! An almost noble anguish of the spirit came upon Vance. He was  urged to the very brink of the determination to thrust out into the world  and make his own living. But he recoiled from that horrible idea in time.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"that was the worst step I ever took. But I was trying to  be wholehearted in the Western way, my dear, and show that I had entered  into the spirit of things.\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" sighed Elizabeth, \"you nearly ruined Terry's  life--and mine!\"    \"Very near,\" said the penitent Vance. \"But then--you see how well it has  turned out? Terry has taken the acid test, and now you can trust him  under any--\"    The words were literally blown off ragged at his lips. Two revolver shots  exploded at them. No one gun could have fired them. And there was a  terrible significance in the angry speed with which one had followed the  other, blending, so that the echo from the lofty side of Sleep Mountain  was but a single booming sound. In that clear air it was impossible to  tell the direction of the noise.    Everyone in the room seemed to listen stupidly for a repetition of the  noises. But there was no repetition.    \"Vance,\" whispered Elizabeth in such a tone that the coward dared not  look into her face. \"It's happened!\"    \"What?\" He knew, but he wanted the joy of hearing it from her own lips.    \"It has happened,\" she whispered in the same ghostly voice. \"But which  one?\"    That was it. Who had fallen--Terry, or the sheriff? A long, heavy step  crossed the little porch. Either man might walk like that.    The door was flung open. Terence Hollis stood before them.    \"I think that I've killed the sheriff,\" he said simply. \"I'm going up to  my room to put some things together; and I'll go into town with any man  who wishes to arrest me. Decide that between yourselves.\"    With that he turned and walked away with a step as deliberately unhurried  as his approach had been. The manner of the boy was more terrible than  the thing he had done. Twice he had shocked them on the same afternoon.  And they were just beginning to realize that the shell of boyhood was  being ripped away from Terence Colby. Terry Hollis, son of Black Jack,  was being revealed to them.    The men received the news with utter bewilderment. The sheriff was as  formidable in the opinion of the mountains as some Achilles. It was  incredible that he should have fallen. And naturally a stern murmur rose:  \"Foul play!\"    Since the first vigilante days there has been no sound in all the West so  dreaded as that deep-throated murmur of angry, honest men. That murmur  from half a dozen law-abiding citizens will put the fear of death in the  hearts of a hundred outlaws. The rumble grew, spread: \"Foul play.\" And  they began to look to one another, these men of action.    Only Elizabeth was silent. She rose to her feet, as tall as her brother,  without an emotion on her face. And her brother would never forget her.    \"It seems that you've won, Vance. It seems that blood will out, after  all.
