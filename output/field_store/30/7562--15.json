I can't keep  track of all these Kis.\"    \"What is the High Ki like?\" asked Prince Marvel, who was much  interested in the conversation of the captains.  But this question the  officers seemed unable to answer.  They shook their heads slowly and  said:    \"The High Ki are not visible to the people of Twi.  Only in cases of  the greatest importance are the High Ki ever bothered or even  approached by the Ki and the Ki-Ki, who are supposed to rule the land  according to their own judgment.  But if they chance to disagree, then  the matter is carried before the High Ki, who live in a palace  surrounded by high walls, in which there are no gates.  Only these  rulers have ever seen the other side of the walls, or know what the  High Ki are like.\"    \"That is strange,\" said the prince.  \"But we, ourselves, it seems, are  to see the High Ki to-morrow, and whoever they may chance to be, we  hope to remain alive after the interview.\"    \"That is a vain hope,\" answered the captains, \"for it is well known  that the High Ki usually decide in favor of the Ki-Ki, and against the  wishes of the old Ki.\"    \"That is certainly encouraging,\" said Nerle.    When the captains had gone and left them to themselves, the esquire  confided to his master his expectations in the following speech:    \"This High Ki sounds something terrible and fierce in my ears, and as  they are doubtless a pair, they will be twice terrible and fierce.  Perhaps his royal doublets will torture me most exquisitely before  putting me to death, and then I shall feel that I have not lived in  vain.\"    They slept in comfortable beds that night, although an empty twin bed  stood beside each one they occupied.  And in the morning they were  served another excellent meal, after which the captains escorted them  again to the twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki.    There the two pairs of rulers met them and headed the long procession  of soldiers toward the palace of the High Ki.  First came a band of  music, in which many queer sorts of instruments were played in pairs by  twin musicians; and it was amusing to Nerle to see the twin drummers  roll their twin drums exactly at the same time and the twin trumpets  peal out twin notes.  After the band marched the double Ki-Ki and the  double Ki, their four bodies side by side in a straight line.  The  Ki-Ki had left their musical instruments in the palace, and now wore  yellow gloves with green stitching down the backs and swung gold-headed  canes jauntily as they walked.  The Ki stooped their aged shoulders and  shuffled along with their hands in their pockets, and only once did  they speak, and that was to roar \"Great Kika-koo!\" when the Ki-Ki  jabbed their canes down on the Ki's toes.    Following the Ki-Ki and the Ki came the prince and Nerle, escorted by  the twin captains, and then there were files of twin soldiers bringing  up the rear.    Crowds of twin people, with many twin children amongst them, turned out  to watch the unusual display, and many pairs of twin dogs barked  together in unison and snapped at the heels of the marching twin  soldiers.    By and by they reached the great wall surrounding the High Ki's palace,  and, sure enough, there was never a gate in the wall by which any might  enter.  But when the Ki and the Ki-Ki had blown a shrill signal upon  two pairs of whistles, they all beheld two flights of silver steps  begin to descend from the top of the wall, and these came nearer and  nearer the ground until at last they rested at the feet of the Ki.  Then the old men began ascending the steps carefully and slowly, and  the captains motioned to the prisoners to follow.  So Prince Marvel  followed one of the Ki up the steps and Nerle the other Ki, while the  two Ki-Ki came behind them so they could not escape.    So to the top of the wall they climbed, where a pair of twin servants  in yellow and green--which seemed to be the royal colors--welcomed them  and drew up the pair of silver steps, afterward letting them down on  the other side of the wall, side by side.    They descended in the same order as they had mounted to the top of the  wall, and now Prince Marvel and Nerle found themselves in a most  beautiful garden, filled with twin beds of twin flowers, with many  pairs of rare shrubs.  Also, there were several double statuettes on  pedestals, and double fountains sending exactly the same sprays of  water the same distance into the air.    Double walks ran in every direction through the garden, and in the  center of the inclosure stood a magnificent twin palace, built of  blocks of white marble exquisitely carved.    The Ki and the Ki-Ki at once led their prisoners toward the palace and  entered at its large arched double doors, where several pairs of  servants met them.  These servants, they found, were all dumb, so that  should they escape from the palace walls they could tell no tales of  the High Ki.    The prisoners now proceeded through several pairs of halls, winding  this way and that, and at last came to a pair of golden double doors  leading into the throne-room of the mighty High Ki.  Here they all  paused, and the Ki-Ki both turned to the prince and Nerle and said:    \"You are the only persons, excepting ourselves and the palace servants,  who have ever been permitted to see the High Ki of Twi.  As you are  about to die, that does not matter; but should you by any chance be  permitted to live, you must never breathe a word of what you are about  to see, under penalty of a sure and horrible death.\"    The prisoners made no reply to this speech, and, after the two Ki-Ki  had given them another mild look from their gentle blue eyes, these  officials clapped their twin hands together and the doors of gold flew  open.    A perfect silence greeted them, during which the double Ki and the  double Ki-Ki bent their four bodies low and advanced into the  throne-room, followed by Prince Marvel and Nerle.    In the center of the room stood two thrones of dainty filigree work in  solid gold, and over them were canopies of yellow velvet, the folds of  which were caught up and draped with bands of green ribbon.  And on the  thrones were seated two of the sweetest and fairest little maidens that  mortal man had ever beheld.  Their lovely hair was fine as a spider's  web; their eyes were kind and smiling, their cheeks soft and dimpled,  their mouths shapely as a cupid's bow and tinted like the petals of a  rose.  Upon their heads were set two crowns of fine spun gold, worked  into fantastic shapes and set with glittering gems.  Their robes were  soft silks of pale yellow, with strings of sparkling emeralds for  ornament.    Anything so lovely and fascinating as these little maids, who were  precisely alike in every particular, neither Prince Marvel nor Nerle  had ever dreamed could exist.  They stood for a time spellbound and  filled with admiration, while the two pairs of rulers bowed again and  again before the dainty and lovable persons of their High Ki.    But it was hard for Nerle to keep quiet for long, and presently he  exclaimed, in a voice loud enough to be heard by all present:    \"By the Great Kika-koo of our friends the Ki, these darling High Ki of  Twi are sweet enough to be kissed!\"        16.  The Rebellion of the High Ki    The bold speech of Nerle's made the two damsels laugh at the same time,  and their sweet laughter sounded like rippling strains of harmonious  music.  But the two Ki-Ki frowned angrily, and the two Ki looked at the  boy in surprise, as if wondering at his temerity.    \"Who are these strangers?\" asked the pretty High Ki, speaking together  as all the twins of Twi did; \"and why are they not mates, but only half  of each other?\"    \"These questions, your Supreme Highnesses,\" said the blond-haired pair  of Ki-Ki, \"we are unable to answer.\"    \"Perhaps, then, the strangers can answer themselves,\" said the little  maids, smiling first upon the Ki-Ki and then upon the prisoners.    Prince Marvel bowed.    \"I am from the great outside world,\" said he, \"and my name is Prince  Marvel.  Until now I have never seen people that live in pairs, and  speak in unison, and act in the same way and think the same thoughts.  My world is much bigger than your world, and in it every person is  proud to think and act for himself.  You say I am only a 'half,' but  that is not so.  I am perfect, without a counterpart; my friend Nerle  is perfect without a counterpart, and it is yourselves who are halved.  For in the Land of Twi no person is complete or perfect without its  other half, and it seems to take two of you to make one man--or one  maid.\"    The sweet faces of the twin High Ki grew thoughtful at this speech, and  they said:    \"Indeed, it may be you are right.  But it is our custom in Twi to do  everything double and to live double.\" Then, turning to the Ki, they  asked: \"Why have you brought these strangers here?\"    \"To ask your Supreme Highnesses to permit them to return again to the  world from whence they came,\" answered the Ki, both of them regarding  their supreme rulers earnestly.    But here the Ki-Ki spoke up quickly in their mild voices, saying:    \"That is not our idea, your Highnesses.  We, the Ki-Ki of Twi, think it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#14)"],[1,"alternative methods used by libraries to  prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are  obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to  minors.  Biek undertook a similar study of the overblocking rates  that result from the Tacoma Library's use of the Cyber Patrol  software.  He began with the 3,733 individual blocks that  occurred in the Tacoma Library in October 2000 and drew from this  data set a random sample of 786 URLs.  He calculated two rates of  overblocking, one with respect to the Tacoma Library's policy on  Internet use  that the pictorial content of the site may not  include \"graphic materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts  which are portrayed obviously and exclusively for sensational or  pornographic purposes\"  and the other with respect to Cyber  Patrol's own category definitions.  He estimated that Cyber  Patrol overblocked 4% of all Web pages in October 2000 with  respect to the definitions of the Tacoma Library's Internet  Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own  category definitions.      It is difficult to determine how reliable Biek's conclusions  are, because he did not keep records of the raw data that he used  in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages as they  looked when he made the determination whether they were properly  classified by the Cyber Patrol program.  Without this  information, it is impossible to verify his conclusions (or to  undermine them).  And Biek's study certainly understates Cyber  Patrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that  Finnell's study likely understates the true rates of overblocking  used in the libraries that he studied.  We also note that Finnell's study, which analyzed a set of  Internet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the same  filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking  categories enabled, found a significantly higher rate of  overblocking than the Biek study did.  Biek found a rate of  overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell study  estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking.  At all events, the  category definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect to  adult use  visual depictions that are obscene or child  pornography  are narrower than the materials prohibited by the  Tacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek's study understates the  rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's definitions for  adults.  In sum, we think that Finnell's study, while we do not  credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because it  states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking  that occurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters  were operating in public libraries.  While these rates are  substantial  between nearly 6% and 15%  we think, for the  reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual  rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be  considered as anything more than minimum estimates of the rates  of overblocking that happens in all filtering programs.  5.        Methods of Obtaining Examples of Erroneously  Blocked Web Sites      The plaintiffs assembled a list of several thousand Web  sites that they contend were, at the time of the study, likely to  have been erroneously blocked by one or more of four major  commercial filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47,  N2H2 Internet Filtering 2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter  3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0.  They compiled this list  using a two-step process.  First, Benjamin Edelman, an expert  witness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than  500,000 URLs and devised a program to feed them through all four  filtering programs in order to compile a list of URLs that might  have been erroneously blocked by one or more of the programs.   Second, Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled  to librarians and professors of library science whom the  plaintiffs had hired to review the blocked sites for suitability  in the public library context.  Edelman assembled the list of URLs by compiling Web pages  that were blocked by the following categories in the four  programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2: Adults  Only, Nudity, Pornography, and Sex, with \"exceptions\" engaged in  the categories of Education, For Kids, History, Medical,  Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex, Nudity,  Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex.      Edelman then assembled a database of Web sites for possible  testing.  He derived this list by automatically compiling URLs  from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories  from the Yahoo index that differed significantly from the  classifications that he had enabled in each of the blocking  programs (taking, for example, Web sites from Yahoo's  \"Government\" category).  He then expanded this list by entering  URLs taken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's  \"related\" search function, which provides the user with a list of  similar sites.  Edelman also included and excluded specific Web  sites at the request of the plaintiffs' counsel.      Taking the list of more than 500,000 URLs that he had  compiled, Edelman used an automated system that he had developed  to test whether particular URLs were blocked by each of the four  filtering programs.  This testing took place between February and  October 2001.  He recorded the specific dates on which particular  sites were blocked by particular programs, and, using commercial  archiving software, archived the contents of the home page of the  blocked Web sites (and in some instances the pages linked to from  the home page) as it existed when it was blocked.   Through this  process, Edelman, whose testimony we credit, compiled a list of  6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or more of the four programs.   Because these sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoo  directory that were unrelated to the filtering categories that  were enabled during the test (i.e., \"Government\" vs. \"Nudity\"),  he reasoned that they were likely erroneously blocked.  As  explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and  discovered that Cyber Patrol had unblocked most of the pages on  the list of 6,777 after he had published the list on his Web  site.  His records indicate that an employee of SurfControl (the  company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site  and presumably checked out the URLs on the list, thus confirming  Edelman's judgment that the majority of URLs on the list were  erroneously blocked.  Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph  Janes, an Assistant Professor in the Information School of the  University of Washington who also testified at trial as an expert  witness.  Janes reviewed the sites that Edelman compiled to  determine whether they are consistent with library collection  development, i.e., whether they are sites to which a reference  librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a  patron as a source of information.          Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost  the entire list of blocked sites that he collected, from which  Janes took a random sample of 859 using the SPSS statistical  software package.  Janes indicated that he chose a sample size of  859 because it would yield a 95% confidence interval of plus or  minus 2.5%.  Janes recruited a group of 16 reviewers, most of  whom were current or former students at the University of  Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites  were appropriate for library use.  We describe the process that  he used in the margin.   Due to the inability of a member of  Janes's review team to complete the reviewing process, Janes had  to cut 157 Web sites out of the sample, but because the Web sites  were randomly assigned to reviewers, it is unlikely that these  sites differed significantly from the rest of the sample.  That  left the sample size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence  interval to plus or minus 2.8%.      Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that  165 of them, or 23.6% percent of the sample, were not of any  value in the library context (i.e., no librarian would,  consistent with professional standards, refer a patron to these  sites as a source of information).  They were unable to find 60  of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample.  Therefore, they  concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the  sample, were examples of overblocking with respect to materials  that are appropriate sources of information in public libraries.   Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.8%, the  study concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual  percentage of sites in the list of 6,775 sites that are  appropriate for use in public libraries is somewhere between  65.0% and 70.6%.  In other words, we can be 95% certain that the  actual number of sites out of the 6,775 that Edelman forwarded to  Janes that are appropriate for use in public libraries (under  Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783.      The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's  methodology, attacking in particular the fact that, while sites  that received two \"yes\" votes in the first round of voting were  determined to be of sufficient interest in a library context to  be removed from further analysis, sites receiving one or two \"no\"  votes were sent to the next round.  The government also correctly  points out that results of Janes's study can be generalized only  to the population of 6,775 sites that Edelman forwarded to Janes.   Even taking these criticisms into account, and discounting  Janes's numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study as  confirming that Edelman's set of 6,775 Web sites contains at  least a few thousand URLs that were erroneously blocked by one or  more of the four filtering programs that he used, whether judged  against"]]]
