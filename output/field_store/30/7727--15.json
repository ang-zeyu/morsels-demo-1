His interest in the      venerable and awful pile under whose hoary vault he was so punctual      an attendant, and particularly in the musical portion of its rites,      might be termed filial, and formed a strong and delightful contrast      to the polite indifference displayed by too many of our Cathedral      dignitaries at the present time.    The final paragraph, after informing us that Dr Haynes died a bachelor,  says:        It might have been augured that an existence so placid and benevolent      would have been terminated in a ripe old age by a dissolution equally      gradual and calm. But how unsearchable are the workings of      Providence! The peaceful and retired seclusion amid which the      honoured evening of Dr Haynes' life was mellowing to its close was      destined to be disturbed, nay, shattered, by a tragedy as appalling      as it was unexpected. The morning of the 26th of February--    But perhaps I shall do better to keep back the remainder of the narrative  until I have told the circumstances which led up to it. These, as far as  they are now accessible, I have derived from another source.    I had read the obituary notice which I have been quoting, quite by  chance, along with a great many others of the same period. It had excited  some little speculation in my mind, but, beyond thinking that, if I ever  had an opportunity of examining the local records of the period  indicated, I would try to remember Dr Haynes, I made no effort to pursue  his case.    Quite lately I was cataloguing the manuscripts in the library of the  college to which he belonged. I had reached the end of the numbered  volumes on the shelves, and I proceeded to ask the librarian whether  there were any more books which he thought I ought to include in my  description. 'I don't think there are,' he said, 'but we had better come  and look at the manuscript class and make sure. Have you time to do that  now?' I had time. We went to the library, checked off the manuscripts,  and, at the end of our survey, arrived at a shelf of which I had seen  nothing. Its contents consisted for the most part of sermons, bundles of  fragmentary papers, college exercises, _Cyrus_, an epic poem in several  cantos, the product of a country clergyman's leisure, mathematical tracts  by a deceased professor, and other similar material of a kind with which  I am only too familiar. I took brief notes of these. Lastly, there was a  tin box, which was pulled out and dusted. Its label, much faded, was thus  inscribed: 'Papers of the Ven. Archdeacon Haynes. Bequeathed in 1834 by  his sister, Miss Letitia Haynes.'    I knew at once that the name was one which I had somewhere encountered,  and could very soon locate it. 'That must be the Archdeacon Haynes who  came to a very odd end at Barchester. I've read his obituary in the  _Gentleman's Magazine_. May I take the box home? Do you know if there is  anything interesting in it?'    The librarian was very willing that I should take the box and examine it  at leisure. 'I never looked inside it myself,' he said, 'but I've always  been meaning to. I am pretty sure that is the box which our old Master  once said ought never to have been accepted by the college. He said that  to Martin years ago; and he said also that as long as he had control over  the library it should never be opened. Martin told me about it, and said  that he wanted terribly to know what was in it; but the Master was  librarian, and always kept the box in the lodge, so there was no getting  at it in his time, and when he died it was taken away by mistake by his  heirs, and only returned a few years ago. I can't think why I haven't  opened it; but, as I have to go away from Cambridge this afternoon, you  had better have first go at it. I think I can trust you not to publish  anything undesirable in our catalogue.'    I took the box home and examined its contents, and thereafter consulted  the librarian as to what should be done about publication, and, since I  have his leave to make a story out of it, provided I disguise the  identity of the people concerned, I will try what can be done.    The materials are, of course, mainly journals and letters. How much I  shall quote and how much epitomize must be determined by considerations  of space. The proper understanding of the situation has necessitated a  little--not very arduous--research, which has been greatly facilitated by  the excellent illustrations and text of the Barchester volume in Bell's  _Cathedral Series_.    When you enter the choir of Barchester Cathedral now, you pass through a  screen of metal and coloured marbles, designed by Sir Gilbert Scott, and  find yourself in what I must call a very bare and odiously furnished  place. The stalls are modern, without canopies. The places of the  dignitaries and the names of the prebends have fortunately been allowed  to survive, and are inscribed on small brass plates affixed to the  stalls. The organ is in the triforium, and what is seen of the case is  Gothic. The reredos and its surroundings are like every other.    Careful engravings of a hundred years ago show a very different state of  things. The organ is on a massive classical screen. The stalls are also  classical and very massive. There is a baldacchino of wood over the  altar, with urns upon its corners. Farther east is a solid altar screen,  classical in design, of wood, with a pediment, in which is a triangle  surrounded by rays, enclosing certain Hebrew letters in gold. Cherubs  contemplate these. There is a pulpit with a great sounding-board at the  eastern end of the stalls on the north side, and there is a black and  white marble pavement. Two ladies and a gentleman are admiring the  general effect. From other sources I gather that the archdeacon's stall  then, as now, was next to the bishop's throne at the south-eastern end of  the stalls. His house almost faces the west front of the church, and is a  fine red-brick building of William the Third's time.    Here Dr Haynes, already a mature man, took up his abode with his sister  in the year 1810. The dignity had long been the object of his wishes, but  his predecessor refused to depart until he had attained the age of  ninety-two. About a week after he had held a modest festival in  celebration of that ninety-second birthday, there came a morning, late in  the year, when Dr Haynes, hurrying cheerfully into his breakfast-room,  rubbing his hands and humming a tune, was greeted, and checked in his  genial flow of spirits, by the sight of his sister, seated, indeed, in  her usual place behind the tea-urn, but bowed forward and sobbing  unrestrainedly into her handkerchief. 'What--what is the matter? What bad  news?' he began. 'Oh, Johnny, you've not heard? The poor dear  archdeacon!' 'The archdeacon, yes? What is it--ill, is he?' 'No, no; they  found him on the staircase this morning; it is so shocking.' 'Is it  possible! Dear, dear, poor Pulteney! Had there been any seizure?' 'They  don't think so, and that is almost the worst thing about it. It seems to  have been all the fault of that stupid maid of theirs, Jane.' Dr Haynes  paused. 'I don't quite understand, Letitia. How was the maid at fault?'  'Why, as far as I can make out, there was a stair-rod missing, and she  never mentioned it, and the poor archdeacon set his foot quite on the  edge of the step--you know how slippery that oak is--and it seems he must  have fallen almost the whole flight and broken his neck. It _is_ so sad  for poor Miss Pulteney. Of course, they will get rid of the girl at once.  I never liked her.' Miss Haynes's grief resumed its sway, but eventually  relaxed so far as to permit of her taking some breakfast. Not so her  brother, who, after standing in silence before the window for some  minutes, left the room, and did not appear again that morning.    I need only add that the careless maid-servant was dismissed forthwith,  but that the missing stair-rod was very shortly afterwards found _under_  the stair-carpet--an additional proof, if any were needed, of extreme  stupidity and carelessness on her part.    For a good many years Dr Haynes had been marked out by his ability, which  seems to have been really considerable, as the likely successor of  Archdeacon Pulteney, and no disappointment was in store for him. He was  duly installed, and entered with zeal upon the discharge of those  functions which are appropriate to one in his position. A considerable  space in his journals is occupied with exclamations upon the confusion in  which Archdeacon Pulteney had left the business of his office and the  documents appertaining to it. Dues upon Wringham and Barnswood have been  uncollected for something like twelve years, and are largely  irrecoverable; no visitation has been held for seven years; four chancels  are almost past mending. The persons deputized by the archdeacon have  been nearly as incapable as himself. It was almost a matter for  thankfulness that this state of things had not been permitted to  continue, and a letter from a friend confirms this view. '[Greek: ho  katechon],' it says (in rather cruel allusion to the Second Epistle to  the Thessalonians), 'is removed at last. My poor friend! Upon what a  scene of confusion will you be entering! I give you my word that, on the  last occasion of my crossing his threshold, there was no single paper  that he could lay hands upon, no syllable of mine that he could hear, and  no fact in connexion with my business that he could remember. But now,  thanks to a negligent maid and a loose stair-carpet, there is some  prospect that necessary business will be transacted without a complete  loss alike of voice and temper.' This letter was tucked into a pocket in  the cover of one of the diaries.    There can be no doubt of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#14)"],[1,"was to be. Near the target, in a good place, sat the  Sheriff upon a raised dais, with many gentlefolk around him. When the  archers had taken their places, the herald came forward and proclaimed  the rules of the game, and how each should shoot three shots, and to him  that should shoot the best the prize of two fat steers was to belong.  A score of brave shots were gathered there, and among them some of the  keenest hands at the longbow in Lincoln and Nottinghamshire; and among  them Little John stood taller than all the rest. \"Who is yon stranger  clad all in scarlet?\" said some, and others answered, \"It is he that  hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric o' Lincoln.\" Thus  the people talked among themselves, until at last it reached even the  Sheriff's ears.    And now each man stepped forward and shot in turn; but though each shot  well, Little John was the best of all, for three times he struck the  clout, and once only the length of a barleycorn from the center. \"Hey  for the tall archer!\" shouted the crowd, and some among them shouted,  \"Hey for Reynold Greenleaf!\" for this was the name that Little John had  called himself that day.    Then the Sheriff stepped down from the raised seat and came to where  the archers stood, while all doffed their caps that saw him coming. He  looked keenly at Little John but did not know him, though he said, after  a while, \"How now, good fellow, methinks there is that about thy face  that I have seen erewhile.\"    \"Mayhap it may be so,\" quoth Little John, \"for often have I seen Your  Worship.\" And, as he spoke, he looked steadily into the Sheriff's eyes  so that the latter did not suspect who he was.    \"A brave blade art thou, good friend,\" said the Sheriff, \"and I hear  that thou hast well upheld the skill of Nottinghamshire against that of  Lincoln this day. What may be thy name, good fellow?\"    \"Men do call me Reynold Greenleaf, Your Worship,\" said Little John; and  the old ballad that tells of this, adds, \"So, in truth, was he a green  leaf, but of what manner of tree the Sheriff wotted not.\"    \"Now, Reynold Greenleaf,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"thou art the fairest hand  at the longbow that mine eyes ever beheld, next to that false knave,  Robin Hood, from whose wiles Heaven forfend me! Wilt thou join my  service, good fellow? Thou shalt be paid right well, for three suits of  clothes shalt thou have a year, with good food and as much ale as  thou canst drink; and, besides this, I will pay thee forty marks each  Michaelmastide.\"    \"Then here stand I a free man, and right gladly will I enter thy  household,\" said Little John, for he thought he might find some merry  jest, should he enter the Sheriff's service.    \"Fairly hast thou won the fat steers,\" said the Sheriff, \"and hereunto  I will add a butt of good March beer, for joy of having gotten such a  man; for, I wot, thou shootest as fair a shaft as Robin Hood himself.\"    \"Then,\" said Little John, \"for joy of having gotten myself into thy  service, I will give fat steers and brown ale to all these good folk, to  make them merry withal.\" At this arose a great shout, many casting their  caps aloft, for joy of the gift.    Then some built great fires and roasted the steers, and others broached  the butt of ale, with which all made themselves merry. Then, when they  had eaten and drunk as much as they could, and when the day faded and  the great moon arose, all red and round, over the spires and towers of  Nottingham Town, they joined hands and danced around the fires, to the  music of bagpipes and harps. But long before this merrymaking had begun,  the Sheriff and his new servant Reynold Greenleaf were in the Castle of  Nottingham.          How Little John Lived at the Sheriff's    THUS LITTLE JOHN entered into the Sheriff's service and found the life  he led there easy enough, for the Sheriff made him his right-hand man  and held him in great favor. He sat nigh the Sheriff at meat, and he ran  beside his horse when he went a-hunting; so that, what with hunting and  hawking a little, and eating rich dishes and drinking good sack, and  sleeping until late hours in the morning, he grew as fat as a stall-fed  ox. Thus things floated easily along with the tide, until one day when  the Sheriff went a-hunting, there happened that which broke the smooth  surface of things.    This morning the Sheriff and many of his men set forth to meet certain  lords, to go a-hunting. He looked all about him for his good man,  Reynold Greenleaf, but, not finding him, was vexed, for he wished to  show Little John's skill to his noble friends. As for Little John, he  lay abed, snoring lustily, till the sun was high in the heavens. At  last he opened his eyes and looked about him but did not move to arise.  Brightly shone the sun in at the window, and all the air was sweet with  the scent of woodbine that hung in sprays about the wall without, for  the cold winter was past and spring was come again, and Little John lay  still, thinking how sweet was everything on this fair morn. Just then he  heard, faint and far away, a distant bugle note sounding thin and clear.  The sound was small, but, like a little pebble dropped into a glassy  fountain, it broke all the smooth surface of his thoughts, until his  whole soul was filled with disturbance. His spirit seemed to awaken  from its sluggishness, and his memory brought back to him all the merry  greenwood life--how the birds were singing blithely there this bright  morning, and how his loved companions and friends were feasting and  making merry, or perhaps talking of him with sober speech; for when  he first entered the Sheriff's service he did so in jest; but the  hearthstone was warm during the winter, and the fare was full, and so  he had abided, putting off from day to day his going back to Sherwood,  until six long months had passed. But now he thought of his good master  and of Will Stutely, whom he loved better than anyone in all the world,  and of young David of Doncaster, whom he had trained so well in all  manly sports, till there came over his heart a great and bitter longing  for them all, so that his eyes filled with tears. Then he said aloud,  \"Here I grow fat like a stall-fed ox and all my manliness departeth from  me while I become a sluggard and dolt. But I will arouse me and go back  to mine own dear friends once more, and never will I leave them again  till life doth leave my lips.\" So saying, he leaped from bed, for he  hated his sluggishness now.    When he came downstairs he saw the Steward standing near the pantry  door--a great, fat man, with a huge bundle of keys hanging to his  girdle. Then Little John said, \"Ho, Master Steward, a hungry man am I,  for nought have I had for all this blessed morn. Therefore, give me to  eat.\"    Then the Steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys in his  girdle, for he hated Little John because he had found favor with the  Sheriff. \"So, Master Reynold Greenleaf, thou art anhungered, art thou?\"  quoth he. \"But, fair youth, if thou livest long enough, thou wilt find  that he who getteth overmuch sleep for an idle head goeth with an empty  stomach. For what sayeth the old saw, Master Greenleaf? Is it not 'The  late fowl findeth but ill faring'?\"    \"Now, thou great purse of fat!\" cried Little John, \"I ask thee not for  fool's wisdom, but for bread and meat. Who art thou, that thou shouldst  deny me to eat? By Saint Dunstan, thou hadst best tell me where my  breakfast is, if thou wouldst save broken bones!\"    \"Thy breakfast, Master Fireblaze, is in the pantry,\" answered the  Steward.    \"Then fetch it hither!\" cried Little John, who waxed angry by this time.    \"Go thou and fetch it thine own self,\" quoth the Steward. \"Am I thy  slave, to fetch and carry for thee?\"    \"I say, go thou, bring it me!\"    \"I say, go thou, fetch it for thyself!\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I, right quickly!\" quoth Little John in a rage.  And, so saying, he strode to the pantry and tried to open the door but  found it locked, whereat the Steward laughed and rattled his keys. Then  the wrath of Little John boiled over, and, lifting his clenched fist, he  smote the pantry door, bursting out three panels and making so large an  opening that he could easily stoop and walk through it.    When the Steward saw what was done, he waxed mad with rage; and, as  Little John stooped to look within the pantry, he seized him from behind  by the nape of the neck, pinching him sorely and smiting him over the  head with his keys till the yeoman's ears rang again. At this Little  John turned upon the Steward and smote him such a buffet that the fat  man fell to the floor and lay there as though he would never move again.  \"There,\" quoth Little John, \"think well of that stroke and never keep a  good breakfast from a hungry man again.\"    So saying, he crept into the pantry and looked about him to see if he  could find something to appease his hunger. He saw a great venison pasty  and two roasted capons, beside which was a platter of plover's eggs;  moreover, there was a flask of sack and one of canary--a sweet sight  to a hungry man. These he took down from the shelves and placed upon a  sideboard, and prepared to make himself merry.    Now the Cook, in the kitchen across the courtyard, heard the loud  talking between Little John and the Steward, and also the blow that  Little John struck the other, so he came running across the court and up  the stairway to where the Steward's pantry was, bearing in his hands the  spit with the roast still upon it. Meanwhile the Steward had gathered  his wits about him and risen to his feet, so that when the Cook came  to the Steward's pantry he saw him glowering through the broken door at  Little John, who was making ready for a good repast, as one dog glowers  at another that has a bone. When the Steward saw the Cook, he came to  him, and, putting one arm over his shoulder, \"Alas, sweet friend!\" quoth  he--for the Cook"]]]
