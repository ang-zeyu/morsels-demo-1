[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#14)"],[1,"as they existed,  more than a century ago, in old Vienna, deservedly eulogized in the song:        Es gibt nur a Kaiserstadt      Es gibt nur a Wien;      Da muss es praechtig sein,      Da moecht' ich hin!    Having arrived at the center of the spacious promenade, we ascended one of  the six northern platforms, communicating by turns with thirty-six aerial  coaches, suspended by an iron axle to the periphery of the mammoth _Ferris  Wheel_. A conductor invited us to step into a coach, as the appropriate  moment had arrived, whereupon we entered a car having the seating capacity  of forty persons, and almost the size of an ordinary Pullman Palace Car.  Ere we were conscious of any movement, the monster wheel was slowly  revolving in response to the powerful machinery by which it was  operated--a trophy of the modern era of eminent progress. The total weight  of the moving mass was 1,200 tons; and its construction involved the  expenditure of $400,000. Reader, if you have not experienced the charm of  this circular ride through a circumference of about 785 feet, you hardly  can convey to your mind the conception of the fascination it afforded.  Since the motion of the coaches was almost imperceptible, we could enjoy  the trip--(viz)--two complete revolutions of the wheel--without the least  excitement naturally aroused by rapid movement. Imagine the sensation of  being carried up 250 feet on one side--and of being slowly lowered on the  other; fancy the enjoyment and delight when gradually gaining a complete  view of the Fair Grounds and the Midway Plaisance--a bird's eye-view of  the whole of Chicago--and also a good portion of Lake Michigan. Dear  reader, you will certainly acknowledge the fact that such a ride surpassed  any similar brief journey ever taken. For, what other device for  transportation can maintain the claim of enabling its passengers to look  upon the whole world during twenty-five minutes!--       \"When you get used to the motion        Only delight you will feel:      Gone is each terrified notion        Once in the circle of steel.      And you enjoy the commotion        Clap and applaud with much zeal:      For it surpasses old ocean        To ride in the great 'Ferris Wheel.'\"    The sun--being almost too liberal in the expenditure of heat--made us long  for a refreshing breeze. Therefore we decided to ride in the  _Ice-Railway._ Here we had opportunity to feel the excitement caused by  velocity of motion. For a seventy mile-an-hour locomotive would have been  monotonous and tiresome in comparison with a dash around the ice-railway  track, containing 850 feet, and covering an elliptic space whose surface  had a coat of ice nearly an inch thick. Over this smooth and glistening  substance the bobsleigh was gliding with the speed of a toboggan and the  ease of a coaster to the merry jingle of sleigh bells.    This exhibit--whose cost amounted to $100,000--gave an example of  inventive genius, and also of the successful application--in a novel  manner--of the principles of refrigeration.    The beautiful building next to the Ice Railway environed an excellent  imitation _en miniature_ of the magnificent _Cathedral of St. Peter_ in  Rome, its size being one-sixteenth of the original. When viewing this  model, the elaborate papal throne, and the Vatican Guards in the exact  uniform of the pope's attendants, one might imagine to have been conveyed  into _la bella Italia_ by the agency of a magic wand.    Promenading more eastward, we found ourselves _vis-a-vis_ the _Moorish  Palace_, a fine reproduction of Saracenic architecture, the famous  Alhambra in Granada, Spain.    The attractions exhibited in the interior of this structure could, indeed,  bear a comparison with those offered in a realm of enchantment. The  optical illusions, produced by ingeniously arranged mirrors, were a  pleasing surprise to the visitor. Luxuriant palms decorating the  labyrinthian garden appeared to be endless in number--casting their shade  over hundreds of life-like figures in gaudy costumes. Each of these groups  in wax, was multiplied again and again in the perspective of mirrors.  Entering the palace, the visitor was unable to shake off the feeling of  perplexity caused by the extraordinary spectacles to be witnessed within  its walls. The most startling surprises were the bottomless well, the  cave, the monster kaleidoscope, and the panopticon. A touching scene,  produced in wax, represented the execution of the unfortunate Queen Marie  Antoinette. So realistic was its effect that many tender-hearted mortals  could not refrain from shedding tears of sympathy for the ill-fated  consort of Louis XVI of France.    A personage of special interest in the _Turkish Village_ was \"Far-a-way  Moses\"--the celebrated guide and counselor of Americans, visiting the  shores of the Bosporus--who has been immortalized by Mark Twain. With a  pleasant smile his popular face, he gave a cordial greeting to every  visitor.    The various scenes constituted a true reproduction of Ottoman life. The  decorations in the Turkish theater were in purely oriental style; and the  representations on the stage showed the manners and customs of the  countries embracing the Turkish Empire. The Bedouin Camp, north of the  grand bazaar, displayed the peculiarities of a nomadic life of those  Arabian tribes.    Adjacent to a Turkish cafe, the _Panorama of the Bernese Alps_ was on  exhibition. A beautiful painting showed the grand scenery of Grindelwald,  the Wetterhorn, the Jungfrau, Schreckhorn, Jura, the village of  Lauterbrunnen, and the little town of Thun.    Ushered by a gate into the _Johore Village_, we viewed the habitations,  weapons, apparels, and curiosities of that Malay tribe. The performance  given by one of the natives stood in striking contrast with what we  understand by the art of dancing. In fact, it was more a series of  graceful poses with slow rythmic movements of hands and feet. This  peculiar dance effected a strange impression upon us; but seemed to amuse  our Baby Virginia beyond measure, who, on the arms of her faithful nurse,  attempted to produce movements similar to those she had just witnessed.    The _South Sea Islanders' Village_ exhibited Malays from Sumatra, Borneo,  Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand, and other islands belonging to Oceanica. The  huts and their occupants had a strong resemblance with those of the  Javanese village whose inhabitants, however, were more agreeable-looking  people.    Paying a visit to _Hagenbeck's Zoological Arena_, we first admired his  famous menagerie, which comprised rare varieties of quadrupeds, and a fine  collection of birds.    In a circus modeled on the plan of the Coliseum of Rome, we witnessed  performances that evinced the wonderful docility Mr. Hagenbeck's animals  possess, and manifested the complete control their trainers have over  them.    We had already seen innumerable circus feats; but those performed on this  occasion, surpassed them all. For, such a perfection in training ferocious  animals is extremely rare. _Vraiment_, the five Nubian giant lions  afforded an imposing aspect; and their performances were simply marvelous,  indicating that--while human ingenuity and skill subdued the great forces  of nature to the use of mankind--also the fierce, majestic king of beasts  is made submissive to man's will by his master power over all.    _Industrial_, _Mining_, _Diving_, and _Horticultural Exhibits_ occupied the  remaining space of this eastern portion, whose extremity was taken up by  _Lady Aberdeen's Irish Village_. Here the displays were similar to those  inclosed in Mrs. Hart's Irish Village, already described; but the novel  feature of _Blarney Castle_ was the renowned Magic Stone, supposed to  possess extraordinary virtues.    Thus, the unique Highway through the Nations afforded a prolific source  for sight-seeing, and furthermore, was a sore trial to our organs of  hearing. Musical and unmusical instruments of every description were in  operation--from the Javanese salendon and pelog to the tuneful  instruments, masterly handled by the excellent German bands.    This visit to the Midway Plaisance established the fact, that the  theories--admitted by the study of geography--could not be brought into  consideration. How should space and time be in existence when a few steps  sufficed to convey us from the land of perpetual snow to the zone of  exotic plants and tropical fruit!       \"Who can all the tribes and nations name      That to Plaisance from every climate came?\"    The Chinese and Turk, German and Cingalese, Esquimaux and Javanese,  Irishman and Polynesian, Bedouin and Laplander, Austrian and Soudanese,  Syrian, Nubian, and Japanese--all had a temporary home within the limits  of a tract of land covering eighty acres.    The sinking sun which crimsoned the structures of the Midway Plaisance,  exhorted us to abandon this place of international _rendez-vous_--and to  return on board the \"Marguerite;\" since she was to convey us back to the  Chicago Harbor.    Gliding along on the crystalline lake,       \"We breathed the airs, not ruffling its face.      Until we came to a quiet place.\"    The latter we chose for our nightly abode; again casting anchor in the  so-called Basin near the Chicago Breakwater.    The approaching night fully deserved its title--the season of silence and  repose. The atmosphere was unusually mild. In the eastern portion of the  sky the light of _Luna_ grew brighter and brighter. Her large, white  circle silvered the tranquil waters and the environing scenes. In front of  us at the airy distance, we viewed the beautiful White City rising from  out the wave as from the stroke of the enchanter's wand; being brilliantly  illumined. Around us lights of many colors flashed from vessels of every  description that lay moored in our vicinity. The scenic beauty of the  surroundings, the balmy air, the charming quietude on the lake--all this  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#14)"],[1,"this god looked forth from its  interior, saying, \"Gather together [men for me], and make ready for me  an abode for multitudes;\" thus came into being . . . . . . .  And his  Majesty (life, health, and strength be to him!) said, \"Let a great  field (sekhet) be produced (hetep);\" thereupon Sekhet-hetep came into  being.  [And the god said], \"I will gather herbs (aarat) therein;\"  thereupon Sekhet-aaru came into being.  [And the god said], \"I will  make it to contain as dwellers things (khet) like stars of all sorts;\"  thereupon the stars (akhekha) came into being.

[FN#62]  i.e., \"the fair and gracious goddess.\"    [FN#63]  Literally, \"My heart hath stopped greatly.\"        And the Majesty of Ra said, \"I decree that supports be to bear [the  goddess up];\" thereupon the props of heaven (heh) came into being.  And  the Majesty of Ra said, \"O my son Shu, I pray thee to set thyself under  [my] daughter Nut, and guard thou for me the supports (heh) of the  millions (heh) which are there, and which live in darkness.  Take thou  the goddess upon thy head, and act thou as nurse for her;\" thereupon  came into being [the custom] of a son nursing a daughter, and [the  custom] of a father carrying a son upon his head.

The supporters  [called] Heh-enti shall be at her side, and one cubit and four spans of  hers shall be in colours, and nine stars shall be on her belly, and Set  shall be by her two thighs and shall keep watch before her two legs,  and before her two legs shall be Shu, under her belly, and he shall be  made (i.e., painted) in green qenat colour. His two arms shall be under  the stars, and his name shall be made (i.e., written) in the middle of  them, namely, Shu himself. \"A boat with a rudder and a double shrine  shall be therein, and Aten (i.e., the Disk) shall be above it, and Ra  shall be in it, in front of Shu, near his hand, or, as another reading  hath, behind him, near his hand.  And the udders of the Cow shall be  made to be between her legs, towards the left side.  And on the two  flanks, towards the middle of the legs, shall be done in writing [the  words], \"The exterior heaven,\" and \"I am what is in me,\" and \"I will  not permit them to make her to turn.\"  That which is [written] under  the boat which is in front shall read, \"Thou shalt not be motionless,  my son;\" and the words which are written in an opposite direction shall  read, \"Thy support is like life,\" and \"The word is as the word there,\"  and \"Thy son is with me,\" and \"Life, strength, and health be to thy  nostrils!\"  And that which is behind Shu, near his shoulder, shall  read, \"They keep ward,\" and that which is behind him, written close to  his feet in an opposite direction, shall read, \"Maat,\" and \"They come  in,\" and \"I protect daily.\"  And that which is under the shoulder of  the divine figure which is under the left leg, and is behind it shall  read, \"He who sealeth all things.\"  That which is over his head, under  the thighs of the Cow, and that which is by her legs shall read,  \"Guardian of his exit.\"  That which is behind the two figures which are  by her two legs, that is to say, over their heads, shall read, \"The  Aged One who is adored as he goeth forth,\" and The Aged One to whom  praise is given when he goeth in.\"  That which is over the head of the  two figures, and is between the two thighs of the Cow, shall read,  \"Listener,\" \"Hearer,\" \"Sceptre of the Upper Heaven,\" and \"Star\" (?).

Then the majesty of this god spake unto Thoth, [saying] \"Let a  call go forth for me to the Majesty of the god Seb, saying, 'Come, with  the utmost speed, at once.\"'  And when the Majesty of Seb had come, the  Majesty of this god said unto him, \"Let war be made against thy worms  (or, serpents) which are in thee; verily, they shall have fear of me as  long as I have being; but thou knowest their magical powers.  Do thou  go to the place where my father Nu is, and say thou unto him, 'Keep  ward over the worms (or, serpents) which are in the earth and water.'  And moreover, thou shalt make a writing for each of the nests of thy  serpents which are there, saying, 'Keep ye guard [lest ye] cause injury  to anything.'  They shall know that I am removing myself [from them],  but indeed I shall shine upon them. Since, however, they indeed wish  for a father, thou shalt be a father unto them in this land for ever.  Moreover, let good heed be taken to the men who have my words of power,  and to those whose mouths have knowledge of such things; verily my own  words of power are there, verily it shall not happen that any shall  participate with me in my protection, by reason of the majesty which  hath come into being before me.  I will decree them to thy son Osiris,  and their children shall be watched over, the hearts of their princes  shall be obedient (or, ready) by reason of the magical powers of those  who act according to their desire in all the earth through their words  of power which are in their bodies.\"            THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND        CHAPTER IV.        IV.  And the majesty of this god said, \"Call to me the god Thoth,\" and  one brought the god to him forthwith.  And the Majesty of this god said  unto Thoth, \"Let us depart to a distance from heaven, from my place,  because I would make light and the god of light (Khu) in the Tuat and  [in] the Land of Caves.  Thou shalt write down [the things which are]  in it, and thou shalt punish those who are in it, that is to say, the  workers who have worked iniquity (or, rebellion).  Through thee I will  keep away from the servants whom this heart [of mine] loatheth. Thou  shalt be in my place (ast) ASTI, and thou shalt therefore be called, O  Thoth, the 'Asti of Ra.'  Moreover, I give thee power to send (hab)  forth . . . . .; thereupon shall come into being the Ibis (habi) bird  of Thoth.  I moreover give thee [power] to lift up thine hand before  the two Companies of the gods who are greater than thou, and what thou  doest shall be fairer than [the work of] the god Khen; therefore shall  the divine bird tekni of Thoth come into being.  Moreover, I give thee  [Power] to embrace (anh) the two heavens with thy beauties, and with  thy rays of light; therefore shall come into being the Moon-god (Aah)  of Thoth.  Moreover, I give thee [power] to drive back (anan) the Ha-  nebu;[FN#64] therefore shall come into being the dog-headed Ape (anan)  of Thoth, and he shall act as governor for me.  Moreover, thou art now  in my place in the sight of all those who see thee and who present  offerings to thee, and every being shall ascribe praise unto thee, O  thou who art God.\"        [FN#64]  i.e., the \"North-lords,\" that is to say, the peoples who lived  in the extreme north of the Delta, and on its sea-coasts, and perhaps  in the Islands of the Mediterranean.            THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND        CHAPTER V.        V.  Whosoever shall recite the words of this composition over himself  shall anoint himself with olive oil and with thick unguent, and he  shall have propitiatory offerings on both his hands of incense, and  behind his two ears shall be pure natron, and sweet-smelling salve  shall be on his lips.  He shall be arrayed in a new double tunic, and  his body shall be purified with the water of the nile-flood, and he  shall have upon his feet a pair of sandals made of white [leather], and  a figure of the goddess Maat shall be drawn upon his tongue with green-  coloured ochre.  Whensoever Thoth shall wish to recite this composition  on behalf of Ra, he must perform a sevenfold (?) purification for three  days, and priests and [ordinary] men shall do likewise.  Whosoever  shall recite the above words shall perform the ceremonies which are to  be performed when this book is being read.  And he shall make his place  of standing (?) in a circle (or, at an angle) . . . . . which is beyond  [him], and his two eyes shall be fixed upon himself, all his members  shall be [composed], and his steps shall not carry him away [from the  place].  Whosoever among men shall recite [these] words shall be like  Ra on the day of his birth; and his possessions shall not become fewer,  and his house shall never fall into decay, but shall endure for a  million eternities.    Then the Aged One himself (i.e., Ra) embraced (?) the god Nu, and spake  unto the gods who came forth in the east of the sky, \"Ascribe ye praise  to the god, the Aged One, from whom I have come into being.  I am he  who made the heavens, and I (set in order [the earth, and created the  gods, and] I was with them for an exceedingly long period; then was  born the year and . . . . . . but my soul is older than it (i.e.,  time).  It is the Soul of Shu, it is the Soul of Khnemu (?),[FN#65] it  is the Soul of Heh, it is the Soul of Kek and Kerh (i.e., Night and  Darkness), it is the Soul of Nu and of Ra, it is the Soul of Osiris,  the lord of Tettu, it is the Soul of the Sebak Crocodile-gods and of  the Crocodiles, it is the Soul of every god [who dwelleth] in the  divine Snakes, it is the Soul of Apep in Mount Bakhau (i.e., the Mount  of Sunrise), and it is the Soul of Ra which pervadeth the whole world.\"        [FN#65]  There are mistakes in the text here.        Whosoever sayeth [these words] worketh his own protection by means of  the words of power, \"I am the god Hekau (i.e., the divine Word of  power), and [I am] pure in my mouth, and [in] my belly; [I am] Ra "]]]
