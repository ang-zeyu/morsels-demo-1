Whence having observed them  to account it the chief glory of their wit, in that they were ablest  to judge, to praise, and by that could esteem themselves worthiest to  love those high perfections which under one or other name they toot  to celebrate, I thought with myself by every instinct and presage of  nature which is not wont to be false, that what emboldened them to  this task might with such diligence as they used embolden me, and that  what judgment, wit, or elegance was my share, would herein best appear  and best value itself by how much more wisely and with more love of  virtue I should choose (let rude ears be absent) the object of  not unlike praises.... Nor blame it in those years to propose to  themselves such a reward as the noblest dispositions above other  things in this life have sometimes preferred. Whereof not to be  sensible when good and fair in one person meet, argues both a gross  and shallow judgment, and withal an ungentle and swainish breast.  For by the firm settling of these persuasions I became so much a  proficient, that if I found those authors anywhere speaking unworthy  things of themselves, or unchaste of those names which before they had  extolled, this effect it wrought with me, from that time forward their  art I still applauded, but the men I deplored; and above them all  preferred the two famous renowners of Beatrice and Laura, who never  write but honour of them to whom they devote their verse, displaying  sublime and pure thoughts without transgression. And long it was not  after, when I was confirmed in this opinion, that he, who would not  be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things,  ought himself to be a true poem, that is a composition and pattern of  the best and honourablest things, not presuming to sing high praises  of heroic men or famous cities, unless he have in himself the  experience and the practice of all that which is praiseworthy.    \"These reasonings together with a certain niceness of nature, an  honest haughtiness and self-esteem, either of what I was or what I  might be, which let envy call pride, and lastly that modesty, whereof,  though not in the title-page, yet here, I may be excused to make some  beseeming profession, all these uniting the supply of their natural  aid together, kept me still above those low descents of mind, beneath  which he must deject and plunge himself, that can agree to saleable  and unlawful prostitutions.    \"Next, for hear me out now, readers, that I may tell ye whither my  younger feet wandered, I betook me among those lofty fables and  romances which recount in solemn cantos the deeds of knighthood  founded by our victorious kings, and from hence had in renown over  all Christendom. There I read it in the oath of every knight, that he  should defend to the expence of his best blood, or of his life if it  so befel him, the honour and chastity of virgin or matron. From whence  even then I learnt what a noble virtue chastity ever must be, to  the defence of which so many worthies by such a dear adventure of  themselves had sworn. And if I found in the story afterwards any of  them by word or deed breaking that oath, I judged it the same fault of  the poet as that which is attributed to Homer to have written undecent  things of the gods. Only this my mind gave me, that every free and  gentle spirit without that oath ought to be borne a knight, nor needed  to expect the gilt spur, or the laying of a sword upon his shoulder,  to stir him up both by his counsel and his arm to serve and protect  the weakness of any attempted chastity. So that even those books which  to many others have been the fuel of wantonness and loose living, I  cannot think how unless by divine indulgence, proved to me so many  incitements to the love and steadfast observation of virtue.\"    This is one of the autobiographical cases in these pamphlets, which  are otherwise arid deserts of sand, scorched by the fire of extinct  passion. It may be asked why it is that a few men, Gibbon or Milton,  are indulged without challenge in talk about themselves, which would  be childish vanity or odious egotism in others. When a Frenchman  writes, \"Nous avons tous, nous autres Français, des séduisantes  qualités\"(Gaffarel), he is ridiculous. The difference is not merely  that we tolerate in a man of confessed superiority what would be  intolerable in an equal. This is true; but there is a further  distinction of moral quality in men's confessions. In Milton, as  in Gibbon, the gratification of self-love, which attends all  autobiography, is felt to be subordinated to a nobler intention.  The lofty conception which Milton formed of his vocation as a poet,  expands his soul and absorbs his personality. It is his office, and  not himself, which he magnifies. The details of his life and nurture  are important, not because they belong to him, but because he belongs,  by dedication, to a high and sacred calling. He is extremely jealous,  not of his own reputation, but of the credit which is due to lofty  endeavour. We have only to compare Milton's magnanimous assumption of  the first place with the paltry conceit with which, in the following  age of Dryden and Pope, men spoke of themselves as authors, to see  the wide difference between the professional vanity of successful  authorship and the proud consciousness of a prophetic mission. Milton  leads a dedicated life, and has laid down for himself the law that  \"he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in  laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem.\"    If Milton had not been the author of _Lycidas_ and _Paradise Lost_,  his political pamphlets would have been as forgotten as are the  thousand civil war tracts preserved in the Thomason collection in  the Museum, or have served, at most, as philological landmarks. One,  however, of his prose tracts has continued to enjoy some degree of  credit down to the present time, for its matter as well as for its  words, _Areopagitica_. This tract belongs to the year 1644, the most  fertile year in Milton's life, as in it he \"brought out two of his  divorce tracts, the _Tractate of Education_, and the _Areopagitica_.  As Milton's moving principle was not any preconceived system of  doctrine but the passion for liberty in general, it was natural that  he should plead, when occasion called, for liberty of the press, among  others. The occasion was one personal to himself.    It is well known that, early in the history of printing, governments  became jealous of this new instrument for influencing opinion. In  England, in 1556, under Mary, the Stationers' Company was invested  with legal privileges, having the twofold object of protecting the  book trade and controlling writers. All publications were required, to  be registered in the register of the company. No persons could set  up a press without a licence, or print anything which had not been  previously approved by some official censor. The court, which had  come to be known as the court of Star-chamber, exercised criminal  jurisdiction over offenders, and even issued its own decrees for the  regulation of printing. The arbitrary action of this court had no  small share in bringing about the resistance to Charles I. But the  fall of the royal authority did not mean the emancipation of the  press. The Parliament had no intention of letting go the control which  the monarchy had exercised; the incidence of the coercion was to be  shifted from themselves upon their opponents. The Star-chamber was  abolished, but its powers of search and seizure were transferred to  the Company of Stationers. Licensing was to go on as before, but to be  exercised by special commissioners, instead of by the Archbishop and  the Bishop of London. Only whereas, before, contraband had consisted  of Presbyterian books, henceforward it was Catholic and Anglican books  which would be suppressed.    Such was not Milton's idea of the liberty of thought and speech in a  free commonwealth. He had himself written for the Presbyterians four  unlicensed pamphlets. It was now open to him to write any number, and  to get them licensed, provided they were written on the same side.  This was not liberty, as he had learned it in his classics, \"ubi  sentire quae velis, et quae sentias dicere licet.\" Over and above this  encroachment on the liberty of the free citizen, it so happened that  at this moment Milton himself was concerned to ventilate an  opinion which was not Presbyterian, and had no chance of passing a  Presbyterian licenser. His _Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_ was  just ready for press when the ordinance of 1643 came into operation.  He published it without licence and without printer's name, in  defiance of the law, and awaited the consequences. There were no  consequences. He repeated the offence in a second edition in February,  1644, putting his name now (the first edition had been anonymous), and  dedicating it to the very Parliament whose ordinance he was setting  at nought. This time the Commons, stirred up by a petition from  the Company of Stationers, referred the matter to the committee of  printing. It went no further. Either it was deemed inexpedient  to molest so sound a Parliamentarian as Milton, or Cromwell's  \"accommodation resolution\" of September 13, 1644, opened the eyes of  the Presbyterian zealots to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#14)"],[1,"this  sevenfold courtesy without discount.\"    \"Oh, Messire de Logreus,\" cried Dame Yolande, \"but what  incomprehensible nonsense you talk! You misinterpret matters, for I  can assure you I had nothing of that sort in mind. Besides, I do not  know what you are talking about.\"    \"Indeed, I must warn you that my actions often speak more  unmistakably than my words. It is what learned persons term an  idiosyncrasy.\"    \"--And I certainly do not see how any of the saints can be concerned  in this. If you had said the Four Evangelists now--! For we were  talking of the Four Evangelists, you remember, this morning--Oh, but  how stupid it is of you, Messire de Logreus, to stand there grinning  and looking at me in a way that makes me blush!\"    \"Well, that is easily remedied,\" said Jurgen, as he blew out the  candles, \"since women do not blush in the dark.\"    \"What do you plan, Messire de Logreus?\"    \"Ah, do not be alarmed!\" said Jurgen. \"I shall deal fairly with  you.\"    And in fact Yolande confessed afterward that, considering  everything, Messire de Logreus was very generous. Jurgen confessed  nothing: and as the room was profoundly dark nobody else can speak  with authority as to what happened there. It suffices that the Duke  of Logreus and the Lady of the Green Castle parted later on the most  friendly terms.    \"You have undone me, with your games and your candles and your  scrupulous returning of courtesies,\" said Yolande, and yawned, for  she was sleepy; \"but I fear that I do not hate you as much as I  ought to.\"    \"No woman ever does,\" says Jurgen, \"at this hour.\" He called for  breakfast, then kissed Yolande--for this, as Jurgen had said, was  their hour of parting,--and he rode away from the Green Castle in  high spirits.    \"Why, what a thing it is again to be a fine young fellow!\" said  Jurgen. \"Well, even though her big brown eyes protrude too  much--something like a lobster's--she is a splendid woman, that Dame  Yolande: and it is a comfort to reflect I have seen justice was done  her.\"    Then he rode back to Cameliard, singing with delight in the thought  that he was riding toward the Princess Guenevere, whom he loved with  his whole heart.          13.    Philosophy of Gogyrvan Gawr      At Cameliard the young Duke of Logreus spent most of his time in the  company of Guenevere, whose father made no objection overtly.  Gogyrvan had his promised talk with Jurgen.    \"I lament that Dame Yolande dealt over-thriftily with you,\" the King  said, first of all: \"for I estimated you two would be as spark and  tinder, kindling between you an amorous conflagration to burn up all  this nonsense about my daughter.\"    \"Thrift, sir,\" said Jurgen, discreetly, \"is a proverbial virtue, and  fires may not consume true love.\"    \"That is the truth,\" Gogyrvan admitted, \"whoever says it.\" And he  sighed.    Then for a while he sat in nodding meditation. Tonight the old King  wore a disreputably rusty gown of black stuff, with fur about the  neck and sleeves of it, and his scant white hair was covered by a  very shabby black cap. So he huddled over a small fire in a large  stone fireplace carved with shields; beside him was white wine and  red, which stayed untasted while Gogyrvan meditated upon things that  fretted him.    \"Now, then!\" says Gogyrvan Gawr: \"this marriage with the high King  of the Britons must go forward, of course. That was settled last  year, when Arthur and his devil-mongers, the Lady of the Lake and  Merlin Ambrosius, were at some pains to rescue me at Carohaise. I  estimate that Arthur's ambassadors, probably the devil-mongers  themselves, will come for my daughter before June is out. Meanwhile,  you two have youth and love for playthings, and it is spring.\"    \"What is the season of the year to me,\" groaned Jurgen, \"when I  reflect that within a week or so the lady of my heart will be borne  away from me forever? How can I be happy, when all the while I know  the long years of misery and vain regret are near at hand?\"    \"You are saying that,\" observed the King, \"in part because you drank  too much last night, and in part because you think it is expected of  you. For in point of fact, you are as happy as anyone is permitted  to be in this world, through the simple reason that you are young.  Misery, as you employ the word, I consider to be a poetical trophe:  but I can assure you that the moment you are no longer young the  years of vain regret will begin, either way.\"    \"That is true,\" said Jurgen, heartily.    \"How do you know? Now then, put it I were insane enough to marry my  daughter to a mere duke, you would grow damnably tired of her: I can  assure you of that also, for in disposition Guenevere is her sainted  mother all over again. She is nice looking, of course, because in  that she takes after my side of the family: but, between ourselves,  she is not particularly intelligent, and she will always be making  eyes at some man or another. To-day it appears to be your turn to  serve as her target, in a fine glittering shirt of which the like  was never seen in Glathion. I deplore, but even so I cannot deny,  your rights as the champion who rescued her: and I must bid you make  the most of that turn.\"    \"Meanwhile, it occurs to me, sir, that it is unusual to betroth your  daughter to one man, and permit her to go freely with another.\"    \"If you insist upon it,\" said Gogyrvan Gawr, \"I can of course lock  up the pair of you, in separate dungeons, until the wedding day.  Meanwhile, it occurs to me you should be the last commentator to  grumble.\"    \"Why, I tell you plainly, sir, that critical persons would say you  are taking very small care of your daughter's honor.\"    \"To that there are several answers,\" replied the King. \"One is that  I remember my late wife as tenderly as possible, and I reflect I  have only her word for it as to Guenevere's being my daughter.  Another is that, though my daughter is a quiet and well-conducted  young woman, I never heard King Thragnar was anything of this sort.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" said Jurgen, horrified, \"whatever are you hinting!\"    \"All sorts of things, however, happen in caves, things which it is  wiser to ignore in sunlight. So I ignore: I ask no questions: my  business is to marry my daughter acceptably, and that only. Such  discoveries as may be made by her husband afterward are his affair,  not mine. This much I might tell you, Messire de Logreus, by way of  answer. But the real answer is to bid you consider this: that a  woman's honor is concerned with one thing only, and it is a thing  with which the honor of a man is not concerned at all.\"    \"But now you talk in riddles, King, and I wonder what it is you  would have me do.\"    Gogyrvan grinned. \"Obviously, I advise you to give thanks you were  born a man, because that sturdier sex has so much less need to  bother over breakage.\"    \"What sort of breakage, sir?\" says Jurgen.    Gogyrvan told him.    Duke Jurgen for the second time looked properly horrified. \"Your  aphorisms, King, are abominable, and of a sort unlikely to quiet my  misery. However, we were speaking of your daughter, and it is she  who must be considered rather than I.\"    \"Now I perceive that you take my meaning perfectly. Yes, in all  matters which concern my daughter I would have you lie like a  gentleman.\"    \"Well, I am afraid, sir,\" said Jurgen, after a pause, \"that you are  a person of somewhat degraded ideals.\"    \"Ah, but you are young. Youth can afford ideals, being vigorous  enough to stand the hard knocks they earn their possessor. But I am  an old fellow cursed with a tender heart and tolerably keen eyes.  That combination, Messire de Logreus, is one which very often forces  me to jeer out of season, simply because I know myself to be upon  the verge of far more untimely tears.\"    Thus Gogyrvan replied. He was silent for a while, and he  contemplated the fire. Then he waved a shriveled hand toward the  window, and Gogyrvan began to speak, meditatively:    \"Messire de Logreus, it is night in my city of Cameliard. And  somewhere one of those roofs harbors a girl whom we will call  Lynette. She has a lover--we will say he is called Sagramor. The  names do not matter. Tonight, as I speak with you, Lynette lies  motionless in the carved wide bed that formerly was her mother's.  She is thinking of Sagramor. The room is dark save where moonlight  silvers the diamond-shaped panes of ancient windows. In every corner  of the room mysterious quivering suggestions lurk.\"    \"Ah, sire,\" says Jurgen, \"you also are a poet!\"    \"Do not interrupt me, then! Lynette, I repeat, is thinking of Sagramor.  Again they sit near the lake, under an apple-tree older than Rome.  The knotted branches of the tree are upraised as in benediction:  and petals--petals, fluttering, drifting, turning,--interminable white  petals fall silently in the stillness. Neither speaks: for there is no  need. Silently he brushes a petal from the blackness of her hair, and  silently he kisses her. The lake is dusky and hard-seeming as jade.  Two lonely stars hang low in the green sky. It is droll that the chest  of a man is hairy, oh, very droll! And a bird is singing, a silvery  needle of sound moves fitfully in the stillness. Surely high Heaven  is thus quietly colored and thus strangely lovely. So at least thinks  little Lynette, lying motionless like a little mouse, in the carved  wide bed wherein Lynette was born.\"    \"A very moving touch, that,\" Jurgen interpolated.    \"Now, there is another sort of singing: for now the pot-house  closes, big shutters bang, feet shuffle, a drunken man hiccoughs in  his singing. It is a love-song he is murdering. He sheds  inexplicable tears as he lurches nearer and nearer to Lynette's  window, and his heart is all magnanimity, for Sagramor is  celebrating his latest conquest. Do you not think that this or  something very like this is happening to-night in my city of  Cameliard, Messire de Logreus?\".    \"It happens"]]]
