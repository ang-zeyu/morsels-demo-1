In like  manner, it is not any energy in the will that produces local motion in  our members: It is God himself, who is pleased to second our will, in  itself impotent, and to command that motion which we erroneously  attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do philosophers stop at  this conclusion. They sometimes extend the same inference to the mind  itself, in its internal operations. Our mental vision or conception of  ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us by our Maker. When we  voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object, and raise up its image in  the fancy, it is not the will which creates that idea: It is the  universal Creator, who discovers it to the mind, and renders it  present to us.    56. Thus, according to these philosophers, every thing is full of God.  Not content with the principle, that nothing exists but by his will,  that nothing possesses any power but by his concession: They rob nature,  and all created beings, of every power, in order to render their  dependence on the Deity still more sensible and immediate. They consider  not that, by this theory, they diminish, instead of magnifying, the  grandeur of those attributes, which they affect so much to celebrate. It  argues surely more power in the Deity to delegate a certain degree of  power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own  immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to contrive at first the  fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that, of itself, and by  its proper operation, it may serve all the purposes of providence, than  if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts, and  animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine.    But if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory,  perhaps the two following reflections may suffice.    57. _First_, it seems to me that this theory of the universal energy and  operation of the Supreme Being is too bold ever to carry conviction with  it to a man, sufficiently apprized of the weakness of human reason, and  the narrow limits to which it is confined in all its operations. Though  the chain of arguments which conduct to it were ever so logical, there  must arise a strong suspicion, if not an absolute assurance, that it has  carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties, when it leads to  conclusions so extraordinary, and so remote from common life and  experience. We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the  last steps of our theory; and _there_ we have no reason to trust our  common methods of argument, or to think that our usual analogies and  probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such  immense abysses. And however we may flatter ourselves that we are  guided, in every step which we take, by a kind of verisimilitude and  experience, we may be assured that this fancied experience has no  authority when we thus apply it to subjects that lie entirely out of the  sphere of experience. But on this we shall have occasion to touch  afterwards.[14]        [14] Section XII.    _Secondly,_ I cannot perceive any force in the arguments on which this  theory is founded. We are ignorant, it is true, of the manner in which  bodies operate on each other: Their force or energy is entirely  incomprehensible: But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or force  by which a mind, even the supreme mind, operates either on itself or on  body? Whence, I beseech you, do we acquire any idea of it? We have no  sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves. We have no idea  of the Supreme Being but what we learn from reflection on our own  faculties. Were our ignorance, therefore, a good reason for rejecting  any thing, we should be led into that principle of denying all energy in  the Supreme Being as much as in the grossest matter. We surely  comprehend as little the operations of one as of the other. Is it more  difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it  may arise from volition? All we know is our profound ignorance in  both cases[15].        [15] I need not examine at length the _vis inertiae_ which is      so much talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed      to matter. We find by experience, that a body at rest or in      motion continues for ever in its present state, till put from      it by some new cause; and that a body impelled takes as much      motion from the impelling body as it acquires itself. These are      facts. When we call this a _vis inertiae_, we only mark these      facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power;      in the same manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain      effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never      the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of all      force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured      to establish that theory upon his authority. On the contrary,      that great philosopher had recourse to an etherial active fluid      to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious      and modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to      be insisted on, without more experiments. I must confess, that      there is something in the fate of opinions a little      extraordinary. DES CARTES insinuated that doctrine of the      universal and sole efficacy of the Deity, without insisting on      it. MALEBRANCHE and other CARTESIANS made it the foundation of      all their philosophy. It had, however, no authority in England.      LOCKE, CLARKE, and CUDWORTH, never so much as take notice of      it, but suppose all along, that matter has a real, though      subordinate and derived power. By what means has it become so      prevalent among our modern metaphysicians?      PART II.      58. But to hasten to a conclusion of this argument, which is already  drawn out to too great a length: We have sought in vain for an idea of  power or necessary connexion in all the sources from which we could  suppose it to be derived. It appears that, in single instances of the  operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any  thing but one event following another, without being able to comprehend  any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between  it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating  the operations of mind on body--where we observe the motion of the  latter to follow upon the volition of the former, but are not able to  observe or conceive the tie which binds together the motion and  volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The  authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit  more comprehensible: So that, upon the whole, there appears not,  throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion which is  conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One  event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them.  They seem _conjoined_, but never _connected_. And as we can have no idea  of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward  sentiment, the necessary conclusion _seems_ to be that we have no idea  of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely  without any meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or  common life.    59. But there still remains one method of avoiding this conclusion, and  one source which we have not yet examined. When any natural object or  event is presented, it is impossible for us, by any sagacity or  penetration, to discover, or even conjecture, without experience, what  event will result from it, or to carry our foresight beyond that object  which is immediately present to the memory and senses. Even after one  instance or experiment where we have observed a particular event to  follow upon another, we are not entitled to form a general rule, or  foretell what will happen in like cases; it being justly esteemed an  unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one  single experiment, however accurate or certain. But when one particular  species of event has always, in all instances, been conjoined with  another, we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one upon the  appearance of the other, and of employing that reasoning, which can  alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence. We then call the one  object, _Cause;_ the other, _Effect._ We suppose that there is some  connexion between them; some power in the one, by which it infallibly  produces the other, and operates with the greatest certainty and  strongest necessity.    It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events  arises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant  conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any  one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and positions.  But there is nothing in a number of instances, different from every  single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only,  that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is carried by  habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant,  and to believe that it will exist. This connexion, therefore, which we  _feel_ in the mind, this customary transition of the imagination from  one object to its usual attendant, is the sentiment or impression from  which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion. Nothing farther  is in the case. Contemplate the subject on all sides; you will never  find any other origin of that idea. This is the sole difference between  one instance, from which we can never receive the idea of connexion, and  a number of similar instances, by which it is suggested.

(North American dogwood).--A deciduous tree,  about 30 feet high, common in the woods in various parts of North  America. The wood is hard, heavy, and very fine grained. It is used in  America for making the handles of light tools, as mallets, plane stocks,  harrow teeth, cogwheels, etc. It has also been used in America for  engraving.    In a letter from Prof. Sargent, Director of the Arnold Arboretum,  Brookline, Massachusetts, quoted in the Kew Report for 1882, p. 35, he  says: \"I have been now, for a long time, examining our native woods  in the hope of finding something to take the place of boxwood for  engraving, but so far I am sorry to say with no very brilliant success.  The best work here is entirely done from boxwood, and some _Cornus  florida_ is used for less expensive engraving. This wood answers fairly  well for coarse work, but it is a difficult wood to manage, splitting,  or rather 'checking,' very badly in drying.\" This, however, he states in  a later letter, \"can be overcome by sawing the logs through the center  as soon as cut. It can be obtained in large quantities.\" Mr. R.H. Keene,  the engraver before referred to, reports that the wood is very rough,  and suitable for bold work.      _Natural Order Ericaceae_.    15. _Rhododendron maximum_, L. (mountain laurel of North America).--Of  this wood it is stated in Porcher's \"Resources of the Southern Fields  and Forests,\" p. 419, that upon the authority of a well-known engraver  at Nashville, Tennessee, the wood is equaled only by the best boxwood.  This species of _Rhododendron_ \"abounds on every mountain from Mason and  Dixon's line to North Georgia that has a rocky branch.\" Specimens of  this wood submitted to Mr. Scott were so badly selected and seasoned  that it was almost impossible to give it a trial. In consideration of  its hardness and apparent good qualities, further experiments should be  made with it.    16. _Rhododendron californicum_.--Likewise a North American species, the  wood of which is similar to the last named. Specimens were sent to Kew  by Professor Sargent for report in 1882, but were so badly seasoned that  no satisfactory opinion could be obtained regarding it.    17. _Kalmia latifolia_, L. (calico bush or ivy bush of North  America).--The wood is hard and dense, and is much used in America for  mechanical purposes. It has been recommended as a substitute for boxwood  for engraving, and trials should, therefore, be made with it.      _Natural Order Epacrideae_.    18. _Monotoca elliptica_, R. Br.--A tall shrub or tree 20 or 30 feet  high, native of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.  The wood has been experimented upon in this country, and though to all  appearances it is an excellent wood, yet Mr. Worthington Smith reported  upon it as having a bad surface, and readily breaking away so that the  cuts require much retouching after engraving.      _Natural Order Ebenaceae_.    19. _Diospyros texana_.--A North American tree, of the wood of which  Professor Sargent speaks favorably. \"It is, however,\" he says, \"in  Texas, at least, rather small, scarcely six inches in diameter, and not  very common. In northern Mexico it is said to grow much larger, and  could probably be obtained with some trouble in sufficient quantities  to become an article of commerce.\" Of this wood Mr. Scott says: \"It is  sufficiently good as regards the grain, but the specimen sent for  trial was much too small for practical purposes.\" Mr. R.H. Keene, the  engraver, says it \"is nearly equal to the best box.\"    20. _Diospyros virginiana_, L. (the persimmon of America).--A good-sized  tree, widely diffused, and common in some districts. The wood is of a  very dark color, hard, and of a fairly close grain. It has been used in  America for engraving, but so far as I am aware has not been tried  in this country. It has, however, been lately introduced for making  shuttles.    21. _Dyospyros ebenum_, Koenig (ebony).--A wood so well known as to  need no description. It has been tried for engraving by Mr. Worthington  Smith, who considers it nearly as good as box.      _Natural Order Apocyneae_.    22. _Hunteria zeylanica_, Gard.--A small tree, common in the warmer  parts of Ceylon. This is a very hard and compact wood, and is used for  engraving purposes in Ceylon, where it is said, by residents, to come  nearer to box than any other wood known. On this wood Mr. Worthington  Smith gave a very favorable opinion, but it is doubtful whether it would  ever be brought from Ceylon in sufficient quantities to meet a demand.      _Natural Order Bignoniaceae_.    23. _Tecoma pentaphylla_, Dl.--A moderate-sized tree, native of the West  Indies and Brazil. The wood is compact, very fine, and even grained, and  much resembles box in general appearance. Blocks for engraving have been  prepared from it by Mr. R.J. Scott, who reported upon it as follows: \"It  is the only likely successor to box that I have yet seen, but it is not  embraced as a deliverer should be, but its time may not be far off.\"      _Natural Order Corylaceae_.    24. _Carpinus betulus_, L. (hornbeam).--A tree from 20 to 70 feet high,  with a trunk sometimes 10 feet in girth, indigenous in the southern  counties of England. The wood is very tough, heavy, and close grained.  It is largely used in France for handles for agricultural and mining  implements, and of late years has been much used in this country for  lasts. The wood of large growth is apt to became shaky, and it is  consequently not used as a building wood. It is said to have been used  as a substitute for box in engraving, but with what success does not  appear.    25. _Ostrya virginica_, Willd (ironwood, or American hornbeam).--A  moderate-sized tree, widely spread over North America. The wood is  light-colored, and extremely hard and heavy; hence the name of ironwood.  It is used in America by turners, as well as for mill cogs, etc., and  has been suggested as a substitute for boxwood for engraving, though no  actual trials, so far as I am aware, have been made with it.    Besides the foregoing list of woods, there are others that have been  occasionally used for posters and the coarser kinds of engraving, such,  for instance, as lime, sycamore, yew, beech, and even pine; and in  America, _Vaccinium arboreum_ and _Azalea nudiflora_. Of these, however,  but little is known as to their value.    It will be noticed that in those woods that have passed through the  engraver's hands, some which promised best, so far as their texture  or grain is concerned, have been tried upon very imperfect or badly  seasoned samples.    The subject is one of so much importance, as was pointed out at the  commencement of this paper, that a thoroughly organized series of  experiments should be undertaken upon carefully seasoned and properly  prepared woods, not only of those mentioned in the preceding list, but  also of any others that may suggest themselves, as being suitable, It  must, moreover, always be borne in mind that the questions of price,  and the considerations of supply and demand, must, to a great extent,  regulate the adaptation of any particular wood.    With regard to those woods referred to as being tried by Mr. Worthington  Smith, he remarks in his report that any of them would be useful for  some classes of work, if they could be imported, prepared, and sold for  a farthing, or less than a halfpenny, per square inch.    Specimens of all the woods here enumerated are contained in the Kew  Museum.           *       *       *       *       *          COMPOSITE PORTRAITS.      Not long since we gave a figure from a drawing by Mr. Grallieni, which,  looked at from a distance, seemed to be a death's head, but which, when  examined more closely, was seen to represent two children caressing  a dog. Since then we have had occasion to publish some landscapes of  Kircher and his imitators, which, looked at sideways, exhibited human  profiles. This sort of amusement has exercised the skill of artists of  all times, and engravings, and even paintings, of double aspect are very  numerous. Chance has recently put into our hands a very curious work of  this kind, which is due to a skillful artist named Gaillot. It is an  album of quite ancient lithographs, which was published at Berlin by  Senefelder. The author, under the title of \"Arts and Trades,\" has drawn  some very amusing faces that are formed through the tools and objects  used in the profession represented. We reproduce a few specimens of  these essentially original compositions of Gaillot. The green grocer is  formed of a melon for the head, of an artichoke and its stem for the  forehead and nose, of a pannier for the bust, etc. The hunter is made up  of a gun, of a powder horn, and of a hunting horn, etc.; and so on for  the other professions. This is an amusing exercise in drawing that we  have thought worthy of reproducing. Any one who is skillful with his  pencil might exercise himself in imagining other compositions of the  same kind.--_La Nature_.    [Illustration: COMPOSITE PORTRAITS.--OCCUPATIONS. 1.

I cannot think of a theme more fit for this hour and place than  handy-craft.
