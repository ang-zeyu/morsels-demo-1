By implication, without  realizing what I was doing, I had already declared myself W. F.  Raffles.  Therefore, W. F. Raffles I would be, in that bank, for that  night.  And the devil teach me how to use my lie!\"    Again he raised his glass to his lips--I had forgotten mine.  His  cigarette-case caught the gas-light as he handed it to me.  I shook my  head without taking my eyes from his.    \"The devil played up,\" continued Raffles, with a laugh.  \"Before I  tasted my soup I had decided what to do.  I had determined to rob that  bank instead of going to bed, and to be back in Melbourne for breakfast  if the doctor's mare could do it.  I would tell the old fellow that I  had missed my way and been bushed for hours, as I easily might have  been, and had never got to Yea at all. At Yea, on the other hand, the  personation and robbery would ever after be attributed to a member of  the gang that had waylaid and murdered the new manager with that very  object.  You are acquiring some experience in such matters, Bunny. I  ask you, was there ever a better get-out?  Last night's was something  like it, only never such a certainty.  And I saw it from the  beginning--saw to the end before I had finished my soup!    \"To increase my chances, the cashier, who also lived in the bank, was  away over the holidays, had actually gone down to Melbourne to see us  play; and the man who had taken my horse also waited at table; for he  and his wife were the only servants, and they slept in a separate  building.  You may depend I ascertained this before we had finished  dinner.  Indeed I was by way of asking too many questions (the most  oblique and delicate was that which elicited my host's name, Ewbank),  nor was I careful enough to conceal their drift.    \"'Do you know,' said this fellow Ewbank, who was one of the downright  sort, 'if it wasn't you, I should say you were in a funk of robbers?  Have you lost your nerve?'    \"'I hope not,' said I, turning jolly hot, I can tell you; 'but--well,  it is not a pleasant thing to have to put a bullet through a fellow!'    \"'No?' said he, coolly.  'I should enjoy nothing better, myself;  besides, yours didn't go through.'    \"'I wish it had!' I was smart enough to cry.    \"'Amen!' said he.    \"And I emptied my glass; actually I did not know whether my wounded  bank-robber was in prison, dead, or at large!    \"But, now that I had had more than enough of it, Ewbank would come back  to the subject.  He admitted that the staff was small; but as for  himself, he had a loaded revolver under his pillow all night, under the  counter all day, and he was only waiting for his chance.    \"'Under the counter eh?' I was ass enough to say.    \"'Yes; so had you!'    \"He was looking at me in surprise, and something told me that to say  'of course--I had forgotten!' would have been quite fatal, considering  what I was supposed to have done.  So I looked down my nose and shook  my head.    \"'But the papers said you had!' he cried.    \"'Not under the counter,' said I.    \"'But it's the regulation!'    \"For the moment, Bunny, I felt stumped, though I trust I only looked  more superior than before, and I think I justified my look.    \"'The regulation!' I said at length, in the most offensive tone at my  command.  'Yes, the regulation would have us all dead men!  My dear  sir, do you expect your bank robber to let you reach for your gun in  the place where he knows it's kept?  I had mine in my pocket, and I got  my chance by retreating from the counter with all visible reluctance.'    \"Ewbank stared at me with open eyes and a five-barred forehead, then  down came his fist on the table.    \"'By God!  That was smart!  Still,' he added, like a man who would not  be in the wrong, 'the papers said the other thing, you know!'    \"'Of course,' I rejoined, 'because they said what I told them.  You  wouldn't have had me advertise the fact that I improved upon the bank's  regulations, would you?'    \"So that cloud rolled over, and by Jove it was a cloud with a golden  lining.  Not silver--real good Australian gold!  For old Ewbank hadn't  quite appreciated me till then; he was a hard nut, a much older man  than myself, and I felt pretty sure he thought me young for the place,  and my supposed feat a fluke.  But I never saw a man change his mind  more openly.  He got out his best brandy, he made me throw away the  cigar I was smoking, and opened a fresh box.  He was a  convivial-looking party, with a red moustache, and a very humorous face  (not unlike Tom Emmett's), and from that moment I laid myself out to  attack him on his convivial flank.  But he wasn't a Rosenthall, Bunny;  he had a treble-seamed, hand-sewn head, and could have drunk me under  the table ten times over.    \"'All right,' I thought, 'you may go to bed sober, but you'll sleep  like a timber-yard!'  And I threw half he gave me through the open  window, when he wasn't looking.    \"But he was a good chap, Ewbank, and don't you imagine he was at all  intemperate.  Convivial I called him, and I only wish he had been  something more.  He did, however, become more and more genial as the  evening advanced, and I had not much difficulty in getting him to show  me round the bank at what was really an unearthly hour for such a  proceeding.  It was when he went to fetch the revolver before turning  in.  I kept him out of his bed another twenty minutes, and I knew every  inch of the business premises before I shook hands with Ewbank in my  room.    \"You won't guess what I did with myself for the next hour.  I undressed  and went to bed.  The incessant strain involved in even the most  deliberate impersonation is the most wearing thing I know; then how  much more so when the impersonation is impromptu!  There's no getting  your eye in; the next word may bowl you out; it's batting in a bad  light all through.  I haven't told you of half the tight places I was  in during a conversation that ran into hours and became dangerously  intimate towards the end.  You can imagine them for yourself, and then  picture me spread out on my bed, getting my second wind for the big  deed of the night.    \"Once more I was in luck, for I had not been lying there long before I  heard my dear Ewbank snoring like a harmonium, and the music never  ceased for a moment; it was as loud as ever when I crept out and closed  my door behind me, as regular as ever when I stopped to listen at his.  And I have still to hear the concert that I shall enjoy much more.  The  good fellow snored me out of the bank, and was still snoring when I  again stood and listened under his open window.    \"Why did I leave the bank first?  To catch and saddle the mare and  tether her in a clump of trees close by: to have the means of escape  nice and handy before I went to work.  I have often wondered at the  instinctive wisdom of the precaution; unconsciously I was acting on  what has been one of my guiding principles ever since.  Pains and  patience were required: I had to get my saddle without waking the man,  and I was not used to catching horses in a horse-paddock.  Then I  distrusted the poor mare, and I went back to the stables for a hatful  of oats, which I left with her in the clump, hat and all.  There was a  dog, too, to reckon with (our very worst enemy, Bunny); but I had been  'cute enough to make immense friends with him during the evening; and  he wagged his tail, not only when I came downstairs, but when I  reappeared at the back-door.    \"As the soi-disant new manager, I had been able, in the most ordinary  course, to pump poor Ewbank about anything and everything connected  with the working of the bank, especially in those twenty last  invaluable minutes before turning in.  And I had made a very natural  point of asking him where he kept, and would recommend me to keep, the  keys at night.  Of course I thought he would take them with him to his  room; but no such thing; he had a dodge worth two of that.  What it was  doesn't much matter, but no outsider would have found those keys in a  month of Sundays.    \"I, of course, had them in a few seconds, and in a few more I was in  the strong-room itself.  I forgot to say that the moon had risen and  was letting quite a lot of light into the bank.  I had, however,  brought a bit of candle with me from my room; and in the strong-room,  which was down some narrow stairs behind the counter in the  banking-chamber, I had no hesitation in lighting it.  There was no  window down there, and, though I could no longer hear old Ewbank  snoring, I had not the slightest reason to anticipate disturbance from  that quarter.  I did think of locking myself in while I was at work,  but, thank goodness, the iron door had no keyhole on the inside.    \"Well, there were heaps of gold in the safe, but I only took what I  needed and could comfortably carry, not much more than a couple of  hundred altogether.  Not a note would I touch, and my native caution  came out also in the way I divided the sovereigns between all my  pockets, and packed them up so that I shouldn't be like the old woman  of Banbury Cross.  Well, you think me too cautious still, but I was  insanely cautious then.  And so it was that, just as I was ready to go,  whereas I might have been gone ten minutes, there came a violent  knocking at the outer door.    \"Bunny, it was the outer door of the banking-chamber!  My candle must  have been seen!  And there I stood, with the grease running hot over my  fingers, in that brick grave of a strong-room!    \"There was only one thing to be done.  I must trust to the sound  sleeping of Ewbank upstairs, open the door myself, knock the visitor  down, or shoot him with the revolver I had been new chum enough to buy  before leaving Melbourne, and make a dash for that clump of trees and  the doctor's mare.  My mind was made up in an instant, and I was at the  top of the strong-room stairs, the knocking still continuing, when a  second"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#14)"],[1,"his cause  against his enemies._    In a short time, indeed, the English from Calais, and from other places  held by them in France, began to make sorties and to carry off much  plunder from the country round, and especially took by storm the Castle of  Banelinghen near Ardres, notwithstanding the truce that prevailed. The  intentions of the King of England were made still more manifest by his  writing a letter to the Flemish towns, saying that, having heard that the  Duke of Burgundy was gathering an army of Flemings to march into Aquitaine  to wage war upon and destroy his subjects, and particularly his very dear  and well-beloved cousins the Dukes of Berri, Orleans, and Bourbon, and the  Counts of Alencon and Armagnac, and the Lord d'Albreth, he therefore  begged them to inform him whether they were willing to conform to the  truce concluded between them and England without in any way assisting  their lord in his wicked purpose.    The Flemish towns replied that they desired in no way to infringe the  truce between the two countries, but that they would serve and assist the  King of France, their sovereign lord, and their Count the Duke of  Burgundy, as heretofore, to the utmost of their power.    In a short time, indeed, it became known that a solemn treaty had been  concluded between the King of England and the Orleanist nobles, they  engaging to aid him to recover Guienne and the parts of Aquitaine he had  lost, while he promised to put an army in the field to assist them.    The position of Sir Eustace was now very difficult. It was uncertain when  the English would move, and it was likely enough that if an army set sail  it would land in Guienne, and that Calais would be able to render no  assistance, so that he would be exposed to the attacks of the Burgundians.  Nor was his position improved when he learned that on the 15th of July the  two French factions, urged by the Count of Savoy, the Grand Master of  Rhodes, and many others, had agreed to terms of peace between them, and  that the Orleanists had formally renounced the English alliance.    At the meeting of the leaders of the party, the Duke of Aquitaine, the  king's son, presided. For a time all the differences were patched up. The  news, however, came too late to arrest the embarkation of the English.  Eight thousand men landed at La Hogue, under the Duke of Clarence, overran  a wide extent of country, being reinforced by 800 Gascons, who had,  according to the agreement with the Orleanists, been raised to join them.  They advanced towards Paris, declaring, however, that they would retire if  the Duke of Berri and his party kept their engagement with them, and paid  them the two hundred thousand crowns he had agreed to do. The Duke had  not, however, the means to pay this amount, and the English therefore  continued to ravage the country, while a large force from Calais, under  the Earl of Warwick, captured the town of Saumer-au-Bois and the Castle of  Ruissault. This, however, was scarcely an invasion, and Sir Eustace, being  doubtful whether Henry meditated operations upon a large scale now that he  had no longer allies in France, took no part in the matter, but remained  quietly in his castle.    Towards the end of March, 1413, a royal herald appeared before the gate.  He was at once admitted, and was received with all honour in the great  hall by Sir Eustace.    \"Sir Eustace de Villeroy.\" he said, \"I come to you in the name of the King  of France, your lord and suzerain. He bids me to say that he has heard  with satisfaction that you refused entry to your castle to those who  demanded it altogether without authority from him; but that, seeing the  importance of the castle in case of trouble with England, and that you are  a vassal of England for estates in that country, he deems it necessary  that its safety should be assured, and therefore calls upon you to send,  in proof of your loyalty to and affection for him, your wife and children  to Paris, where they shall be cared for in all honour and as becomes their  condition; or to receive a garrison of royal troops of such strength as to  defend it from any fresh assault that may be made upon it, either on the  part of those who before attacked it, or of England. He charges you on  your fealty to accept one or other of these conditions, or to be deemed a  false vassal, which he cannot believe you are, knowing you to be a brave  and worthy knight. Here is a document with the king's signature and seal  to the effect which I have delivered to you.\"    \"His Majesty's demands come upon me as a surprise,\" the knight said  gravely, \"and I pray you to abide with me till to-morrow, by which time I  shall have had leisure to consider the alternative and be ready to give  you answer.\"    \"Your request is a reasonable one, Sir Eustace,\" the herald replied, \"and  I will await the answer for twenty-four hours.\"    The herald was then conducted to the guest-chamber, and Sir Eustace went  out into the court-yard and for some time busied himself with the usual  affairs of his estate and talked to the tenants as to their plans; then he  went up on to the wall and there paced moodily backwards and forwards  thinking over the summons that he had received. He knew that Margaret had  been in the gallery in the hall and had heard the message the herald had  delivered, and he wished to think it well over before seeing her. His  position was, he felt, a perilous one. The last treaty of peace between  France and England had drawn the frontier line more straitly in. After  Cressy was fought, but a few miles away, Villeroy had stood within the  English line as far as it now stood without it. That Henry, who although  now old and averse to war, must yet ere long again renew the war that had  so long languished he had little doubt; but he had no hope of succour at  present, and felt that though able to withstand any sudden attack like  that he had recently repulsed, he could not hope to make a successful  defence against a great force provided with battering machines.    The message from the king was indeed but a message from Burgundy, but if  Burgundy was all-powerful just at present it had the same effect as if it  were the king and not he who had sent the summons. He could see no way of  temporizing save that Margaret and the children should go as hostages, and  the idea of this was wholly repugnant to him. Were he to admit a French  garrison the castle would be virtually lost to him; for once powerless, he  could easily be set aside in favour of one of Burgundy's followers. The  only alternative then seemed to be that he should altogether forsake the  castle and estate so long held by his ancestors, and retire to England,  until maybe some day Henry might again place him in possession of it. He  regretted now that he had not told Margaret that she had best keep her  chamber, for she then would have known nothing of the alternative that she  should go as a hostage--an alternative, he foresaw, that she was likely to  favour, as by so doing the necessity for making an absolute decision and  choosing between France and England would be postponed. At length, still  undecided in his mind, he descended from the wall and went up to his  wife's apartments.          CHAPTER V -- HOSTAGES      Margaret rose to meet her husband when he entered. She had looked pale in  her dress of deep mourning before, but he thought that she looked paler  now. She, too, had evidently been thinking over the summons that he had  received, and there was an expression of firmness and resolution in her  face that seemed to say that she had arrived at a more definite conclusion  than he had done.    \"'Tis a knotty question, wife,\" Sir Eustace said. \"In the first place, it  is clear we cannot hope to defend the castle successfully against an  attack by Burgundy. The last was but of the character of a raid, the next  would be a serious siege by experienced soldiers provided with all proper  means and appliances. Before, it was certain that Sir Clugnet would, if he  tarried here, be shortly attacked by the Burgundians, whereas now there  would be no prospect of assistance. There is no hope of help from England,  for there is no force in Calais that could contend with that which would  probably be sent against me; therefore I take it that if attacked the  castle must in the end fall, in which case probably its defenders would  all be put to the sword. I myself should most likely be killed, the  estates forfeited, and you and the children taken prisoners to Paris. Now  it seems to me that that is not to be thought of. It remains to decide,  therefore, whether we shall abandon the castle and journey to England, or  whether we will admit a Burgundian garrison, which will in fact, we may be  sure, be the first step towards losing the castle and estate altogether.  It seems to me that the first will be the best plan. I see no chance of it  at present, but in time Henry may invade France; and as we lie only some  seven or eight miles from the frontier he would doubtless recapture  Villeroy, and we should again become its masters.\"    \"You have not mentioned the other alternative, Eustace, namely, that I and  the children should go to Paris as hostages; and this, it seems to me, is  the best of the three to follow. If there were indeed a chance of an  English invasion I should not say so, but I think not that there is any  such prospect. It is many years since England has done aught in earnest,  and during all that time her power in France has been waning. I would not  that our children should lose this fair estate when it can well be  preserved by some slight sacrifice on my part. Were I and the children to  go to Paris it would put an end to all doubts as to your loyalty, and you  would hold the castle and estates. The peace now patched up between the  parties will not last, and as soon as they are engaged with each other,  and have no time to spare to"]]]
