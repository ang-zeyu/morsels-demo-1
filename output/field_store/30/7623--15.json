This invitation was, however, not  heeded. In Champlain's opinion it was a _ruse_ contrived only to furnish a  fresh opportunity to attack and overpower them.    On the 30th of September, they left the harbor of Gloucester, and, during  the following night, sailing in a southerly direction, passing Brant Point,  they found themselves in the lower part of Cape Cod Bay. When the sun rose,  a low, sandy shore stretched before them. Sending their boat forward to a  place where the shore seemed more elevated, they found deeper water and a  harbor, into which they entered in five or six fathoms. They were welcomed  by three Indian canoes. They found oysters in such quantities in this bay,  and of such excellent quality, that they named it _Le Port aux Huistres_,  [54] or Oyster Harbor. After a few hours, they weighed anchor, and  directing their course north, a quarter northeast, with a favoring wind,  soon doubled Cape Cod. The next day, the 2d of October, they arrived off  Nauset. De Poutrincourt, Champlain, and others entered the harbor in a  small boat, where they were greeted by a hundred and fifty savages with  singing and dancing, according to their usual custom. After a brief visit,  they returned to the barque and continued their course along the sandy  shore. When near the heel of the cape, off Chatham, they found themselves  imperilled among breakers and sand-banks, so dangerous as to render it  inexpedient to attempt to land, even with a small boat. The savages were  observing them from the shore, and soon manned a canoe, and came to them  with singing and demonstrations of joy. From them, they learned that lower  down a harbor would be found, where their barque might ride in safety.  Proceeding, therefore, in the same direction, after many difficulties, they  succeeded in rounding the peninsula of Monomoy, and finally, in the gray of  the evening, cast anchor in the offing near Chatham, now known as Old Stage  Harbor. The next day they entered, passing between Harding's Beach Point  and Morris Island, in two fathoms of water, and anchored in Stage Harbor.  This harbor is about a mile long and half a mile wide, and at its western  extremity is connected by tide-water with Oyster Pond, and with Mill Cove  on the east by Mitchell's River. Mooring their barque between these two  arms of the harbor, towards the westerly end, the explorers remained there  about three weeks. It was the centre of an Indian settlement, containing  five or six hundred persons. Although it was now well into October, the  natives of both sexes were entirely naked, with the exception of a slight  band about the loins. They subsisted upon fish and the products of the  soil. Indian corn was their staple. It was secured in the autumn in bags  made of braided grass, and buried in the sand-banks, and withdrawn as it  was needed during the winter. The savages were of fine figure and of olive  complexion. They adorned themselves with an embroidery skilfully interwoven  with feathers and beads, and dressed their hair in a variety of braids,  like those at Saco. Their dwellings were conical in shape, covered with  thatch of rushes and corn-husks, and surrounded by cultivated fields. Each  cabin contained one or two beds, a kind of matting, two or three inches in  thickness, spread upon a platform on which was a layer of elastic staves,  and the whole raised a foot from the ground. On these they secured  refreshing repose. Their chiefs neither exercised nor claimed any superior  authority, except in time of war. At all other times and in all other  matters complete equality reigned throughout the tribe.    The stay at Chatham was necessarily prolonged in baking bread to serve the  remainder of the voyage, and in repairing their barque, whose rudder had  been badly shattered in the rough passage round the cape. For these  purposes, a bakery and a forge were set up on shore, and a tent pitched for  the convenience and protection of the workmen. While these works were in  progress, De Poutrincourt, Champlain, and others made frequent excursions  into the interior, always with a guard of armed men, sometimes making a  circuit of twelve or fifteen miles. The explorers were fascinated with all  they saw. The aroma of the autumnal forest and the balmy air of October  stimulated their senses. The nut-trees were loaded with ripe fruit, and the  rich clusters of grapes were hanging temptingly upon the vines. Wild game  was plentiful and delicious. The fish of the bay were sweet, delicate, and  of many varieties. Nature, unaided by art, had thus supplied so many human  wants that Champlain gravely put upon record his opinion that this would be  a most excellent place in which to lay the foundations of a commonwealth,  if the harbor were deeper and better protected at its mouth.    After the voyagers had been in Chatham eight or nine days, the Indians,  tempted by the implements which they saw about the forge and bakery,  conceived the idea of taking forcible possession of them, in order to  appropriate them to their own use. As a preparation for this, and  particularly to put themselves in a favorable condition in case of an  attack or reprisal, they were seen removing their women, children, and  effects into the forests, and even taking down their cabins. De  Poutrincourt, observing this, gave orders to the workmen to pass their  nights no longer on shore, but to go on board the barque to assure their  personal safety. This command, however, was not obeyed. The next morning,  at break of day, four hundred savages, creeping softly over a hill in the  rear, surrounded the tent, and poured such a volley of arrows upon the  defenceless workmen that escape was impossible. Three of them were killed  upon the spot; a fourth was mortally and a fifth badly wounded. The alarm  was given by the sentinel on the barque. De Poutrincourt, Champlain, and  the rest, aroused from their slumbers, rushed half-clad into the ship's  boat, and hastened to the rescue. As soon as they touched the shore, the  savages, fleet as the greyhound, escaped to the wood. Pursuit, under the  circumstances, was not to be made; and, if it had been, would have ended in  their utter destruction. Freed from immediate danger, they collected the  dead and gave them Christian burial near the foot of a cross, which had  been erected the day before. While the service of prayer and song was  offered, the savages in the distance mocked them with derisive attitudes  and hideous howls. Three hours after the French had retired to their  barque, the miscreants returned, tore down the cross, disinterred the dead,  and carried off the garments in which they had been laid to rest. They were  immediately driven off by the French, the cross was restored to its place,  and the dead reinterred.    Before leaving Chatham, some anxiety was felt in regard to their safety in  leaving the harbor, as the little barque had scarcely been able to weather  the rough seas of Monomoy on their inward voyage. A boat had been sent out  in search of a safer and a better roadway, which, creeping along by the  shore sixteen or eighteen miles, returned, announcing three fathoms of  water, and neither bars nor reefs. On the 16th of October they gave their  canvas to the breeze, and sailed out of Stage Harbor, which they had named  _Port Fortune_, [55] an appellation probably suggested by their narrow  escape in entering and by the bloody tragedy to which we have just  referred. Having gone eighteen or twenty miles, they sighted the island of  Martha's Vineyard lying low in the distance before them, which they called  _La Soupconneuse_, the suspicious one, as they had several times been in  doubt whether it were not a part of the mainland. A contrary wind forced  them to return to their anchorage in Stage Harbor. On the 20th they set out  again, and continued their course in a southwesterly direction until they  reached the entrance of Vineyard Sound. The rapid current of tide water  flowing from Buzzard's Bay into the sound through the rocky channel between  Nonamesset and Wood's Holl, they took to be a river coming from the  mainland, and named it _Riviere de Champlain_.    This point, in front of Wood's Holl, is the southern limit of the French  explorations on the coast of New England, reached by them on the 20th of  October, 1606.    Encountering a strong wind, approaching a gale, they were again forced to  return to Stage Harbor, where they lingered two or three days, awaiting  favoring winds for their return to the colony at the bay of Annapolis.    We regret to add that, while they were thus detained, under the very shadow  of the cross they had recently erected, the emblem of a faith that teaches  love and forgiveness, they decoyed, under the guise of friendship, several  of the poor savages into their power, and inhumanly butchered them in cold  blood. This deed was perpetrated on the base principle of _lex talionis_,  and yet they did not know, much less were they able to prove, that their  victims were guilty or took any part in the late affray. No form of trial  was observed, no witnesses testified, and no judge adjudicated. It was a  simple murder, for which we are sure any Christian's cheek would mantle  with shame who should offer for it any defence or apology.    When this piece of barbarity had been completed, the little French barque  made its final exit from Stage Harbor, passed successfully round the shoals  of Monomoy, and anchored near Nauset, where they remained a day or two,  leaving on the 28th of October, and sailing directly to Isle Haute in  Penobscot Bay. They made brief stops at some of the islands at the mouth of  the St. Croix, and at the Grand Manan, and arrived at Annapolis Basin on  the 14th of November, after an exceedingly rough passage and many  hair-breadth escapes.

He accordingly  advanced to Peronne, which was not far from the frontier, and sent  forward a courier to announce his approach. The royal family concluded  to go out in their carriages to meet him. They were at this time at  a famous royal resort a few leagues from Paris, called Compiegne.  Charles was to dine at Compiegne, and then to proceed on toward Paris,  where he had business to transact connected with his political plans.    Anne Maria gives a minute account of the ride of the royal family to  meet Charles on his approach to Compiegne, and of the interview with  him, on her part, which attended it. She dressed herself in the morning,  she says, with great care, and had her hair curled, which she seldom  did except on very special occasions. When she entered the carriage  to go out to meet the king, the queen regent, observing her appearance,  said archly, \"How easy it is to tell when young ladies expect to meet  their lovers.\" Anne Maria says that she had a great mind to tell her,  in reply, that it _was_ easy, for those who had had a great deal of  experience in preparing to meet lovers themselves. She did not, however,  say this, and the forbearance seems to show that there was, after all,  the latent element of discretion and respect for superiors in her  character, though it showed itself so seldom in action.    They rode out several miles to meet the coming king; and when the two  parties met, they all alighted, and saluted each other by the road  side, the ladies and gentlemen that accompanied them standing around.  Anne Maria noticed that Charles addressed the king and queen regent  first, and then her. After a short delay they got into their carriages  again--King Charles entering the carriage with their majesties and  Anne Maria--and they rode together thus back to Compiegne.    Anne Maria, however, does not seem to have been in a mood to be pleased.  She says that Charles began to talk with the king--Louis XIV.--who was  now twelve years old, about the dogs and horses, and the hunting customs  in the country of the Prince of Orange. He talked on these subjects  fluently enough in the French language, but when afterward the queen  regent, who would naturally be interested in a different class of  topics, asked him about the affairs of his own kingdom and his plans  for recovering it, he excused himself by saying that he did not speak  French well enough to give her the information. Anne Maria says she  determined from that moment not to conclude the marriage, \"for I  conceived a very poor opinion of him, being a king, and at his age,  to have no knowledge of his affairs.\" Such minds as Anne Maria's are  seldom very logical; but such an inference as this, that he was ignorant  of his own affairs because he declined explaining plans whose success  depended on secrecy in such a company as that, and in a language with  which, though he could talk about dogs and horses in it, he was still  very imperfectly acquainted, is far too great a jump from premises to  conclusion to be honestly made. It is very evident that Anne Maria was  not disposed to be pleased.    They arrived at Compiegne. As the king was going on that evening,  dinner was served soon after they arrived. Anne Maria says he ate no  ortolans, a very expensive and rare dish of little birds, which had  been prepared expressly for this dinner in honor of the royal guest,  [Footnote: The ortolan is a very small bird, which is fattened in lamp  lighted rooms at great expense, because it is found to be of a more  delicate flavor when excluded from the daylight. They come from the  island of Cyprus, and have been famous in every age of the world as  an article of royal luxury.] \"but flung himself upon a piece of beef  and a shoulder of mutton, as if there had been nothing else at table.  After dinner, when we were in the drawing room, the queen amused herself  with the other ladies and gentlemen, and left him with me. He was a  quarter of an hour without speaking a word; but I am willing to believe  that his silence was the result of respect rather than any want of  passion, though on this occasion, I frankly confess, I could have  wished it less plainly exhibited. After a while, getting tired of his  tediousness, I called another lady to my side, to see if she could not  make him talk. She succeeded. Presently one of the gentlemen of the  party came to me and said, 'He kept looking at you all dinner time,  and is looking at you still.' To which I replied, 'He has plenty of  time to look at me before he will please me, if he does not speak.'  The gentleman rejoined, 'Oh, he has said tender things enough to you,  no doubt, only you don't like to admit it.' To which I answered, 'Come  and seat yourself by me the next time he is at my side, and hear for  yourself how he talks about it.\" She says she then went and addressed  the king herself, asking him various questions about persons who were  in his suite, and that he answered them all with an air of mere common  politeness, without any gallantry at all.    Finally, the hour for the departure of Charles and his party arrived,  and the carriages came to the door. The French king, together with his  mother and Anne Maria, and the usual attendants, accompanied them some  miles into the forest on their way, and then, all alighting, as they  had done when they met in the morning, they took leave of each other  with the usual ceremonies of such occasions. Charles, after bidding  King Louis farewell, advanced with Lord Germain, who was present in  his suite at that time, to Anne Maria, and she gives the following  rather petulant account of what passed: \"'I believe,' said Charles,  'that my Lord Germain, who speaks French better than I do, has explained  to you my sentiments and my intention. I am your very obedient servant.'  I answered that I was equally his obedient servant. Germain paid me  a great number of compliments, the king standing by. After they were  over, the king bowed and departed.\"    Charles, who had been all his life living roughly in camps, felt  naturally ill at ease in the brilliant scenes of ceremony and splendor  which the French court presented; and this embarrassment was greatly  increased by the haughty air and manner, and the ill concealed raillery  of the lady whose favorable regard he was so anxious to secure. His  imperfect knowledge of the language, and his sense of the gloomy  uncertainty of his own prospects in life, tended strongly to increase  his distrust of himself and his timidity. We should have wished that  he could have experienced somewhat kinder treatment from the object  of his regard, were it not that his character, and especially his  subsequent history, show that he was entirely mercenary and selfish  himself in seeking her hand. If we can ever, in any instance, pardon  the caprice and wanton cruelty of a coquette, it is when these qualities  are exercised in thwarting the designs of a heartless speculator, who  is endeavoring to fill his coffers with money by offering in exchange  for it a mere worthless counterfeit of love.    Charles seems to have been totally discouraged by the result of this  unfortunate dinner party at Compiegne. He went to Paris, and from Paris  he went to St. Germain's, where he remained for several months with  his mother, revolving in his mind his fallen fortunes, and forming  almost hopeless schemes for seeking to restore them. In the mean time,  the wife whom the Emperor of Germany had married instead of Anne Maria,  died, and the young belle sprang immediately into the excitement of  a new hope of attaining the great object of her ambition after all.  The emperor was fifty years of age, and had four children, but he was  the Emperor of Germany, and that made amends for all. Anne Maria  immediately began to lay her trains again for becoming his bride. What  her plans were, and how they succeeded, we shall, perhaps, have occasion  hereafter to describe.    Though her heart was thus set upon having the emperor for her husband,  she did not like, in the mean time, quite to give up her younger and  more agreeable beau. Besides, her plans of marrying the emperor might  fail, and Charles might succeed in recovering his kingdom. It was best,  therefore, not to bring the negotiation with him to too absolute a  close. When the time arrived, therefore, for Charles to take his  departure, she thought she would just ride out to St. Germain's and  pay her respects to Queen Henrietta, and bid the young king good-by.    Neither Queen Henrietta nor her son attempted to renew the negotiation  of his suite on the occasion of this visit. The queen told Anne Maria,  on the other hand, that she supposed she ought to congratulate her on  the death of the Empress of Germany, for, though the negotiation for  her marriage with him had failed on a former occasion, she had no doubt  it would be resumed now, and would be successful. Anne Maria replied,  with an air of indifference, that she did not know or think any thing  about it. The queen then said that she knew of a young man, not very  far from them, who thought that a king of nineteen years of age was  better for a husband than a man of fifty, a widower with four children,  even if he was an emperor. \"However,\" said she, \"we do not know what  turn things may take. My son may succeed in recovering his kingdom,  and then, perhaps, if you should be in a situation to do so, you may  listen more favorably to his addresses.\"    Anne Maria was not to return directly back to Paris. She was going to  visit her sisters, who lived at a little distance beyond. The Duke of  York, that is, Henrietta's son James, then fourteen or fifteen years  old, proposed to accompany her. She consented. Charles then proposed  to go too. Anne Maria objected to this, saying that it was not quite  proper. She had no objection to James's going, as he was a mere youth.  Queen Henrietta removed "]]]
