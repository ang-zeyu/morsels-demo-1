If you want to see  spirits we will play phantom for you, and convince you of our power.\"    \"Good, let us go and have a ghostly dance, as a proper finale of our  revel,\" answered Rose as they flocked into the long hall.    At that moment the great clock struck twelve, and all paused to bid the  old year adieu. Sir Jasper was the first to speak, for, angry with Mrs.  Snowdon, yet thankful to her for making a jest to others of what had  been earnest to him, he desired to hide his chagrin under a gay manner;  and taking Rose around the waist was about to waltz away as she  proposed, saying cheerily, \"'Come one and all, and dance the new year  in,'\" when a cry from Octavia arrested him, and turning he saw her  stand, pale and trembling, pointing to the far end of the hall.    Eight narrow Gothic windows pierced either wall of the north  gallery. A full moon sent her silvery light strongly in upon the  eastern side, making broad bars of brightness across the floor. No  fires burned there now, and wherever the moonlight did not fall deep  shadows lay. As Octavia cried out, all looked, and all distinctly  saw a tall, dark figure moving noiselessly across the second bar of  light far down the hall.    \"Is it some jest of yours?\" asked Sir Jasper of Mrs. Snowdon, as the  form vanished in the shadow.    \"No, upon my honor, I know nothing of it! I only meant to relieve  Octavia's superstitious fears by showing her our pranks\" was the  whispered reply as Mrs. Snowdon's cheek paled, and she drew nearer  to Jasper.    \"Who is there?\" called Treherne in a commanding tone.    No answer, but a faint, cold breath of air seemed to sigh along the  arched roof and die away as the dark figure crossed the third streak  of moonlight. A strange awe fell upon them all, and no one spoke, but  stood watching for the appearance of the shape. Nearer and nearer it  came, with soundless steps, and as it reached the sixth window its  outlines were distinctly visible. A tall, wasted figure, all in black,  with a rosary hanging from the girdle, and a dark beard half  concealing the face.    \"The Abbot's ghost, and very well got up,\" said Annon, trying to laugh  but failing decidedly, for again the cold breath swept over them,  causing a general shudder.    \"Hush!\" whispered Treherne, drawing Octavia to his side with a  protecting gesture.    Once more the phantom appeared and disappeared, and as they waited for  it to cross the last bar of light that lay between it and them, Mrs.  Snowdon stepped forward to the edge of the shadow in which they stood,  as if to confront the apparition alone. Out of the darkness it came, and  in the full radiance of the light it paused. Mrs. Snowdon, being  nearest, saw the face first, and uttering a faint cry dropped down upon  the stone floor, covering up her eyes. Nothing human ever wore a look  like that of the ghastly, hollow-eyed, pale-lipped countenance below the  hood. All saw it and held their breath as it slowly raised a shadowy arm  and pointed a shriveled finger at Sir Jasper.    \"Speak, whatever you are, or I'll quickly prove whether you are man or  spirit!\" cried Jasper fiercely, stepping forward as if to grasp the  extended arm that seemed to menace him alone.    An icy gust swept through the hall, and the phantom slowly receded into  the shadow. Jasper sprang after it, but nothing crossed the second  stream of light, and nothing remained in the shade. Like one possessed  by a sudden fancy he rushed down the gallery to find all fast and empty,  and to return looking very strangely. Blanche had fainted away and Annon  was bearing her out of the hall. Rose was clinging to Mrs. Snowdon, and  Octavia leaned against her cousin, saying in a fervent whisper, \"Thank  God it did not point at you!\"    \"Am I then dearer than your brother?\" he whispered back.    There was no audible reply, but one little hand involuntarily pressed  his, though the other was outstretched toward Jasper, who came up white  and startled but firm and quiet. Affecting to make light of it, he said,  forcing a smile as he raised Mrs. Snowdon, \"It is some stupid joke of  the servants. Let us think no more of it. Come, Edith, this is not like  your usual self.\"    \"It was nothing human, Jasper; you know it as well as I. Oh, why did I  bring you here to meet the warning phantom that haunts your house!\"    \"Nay, if my time is near the spirit would have found me out wherever  I might be. I have no faith in that absurd superstition--I laugh at  and defy it. Come down and drink my health in wine from the Abbot's  own cellar.\"    But no one had heart for further gaiety, and, finding Lady Treherne  already alarmed by Annon, they were forced to tell her all, and find  their own bewilderment deepened by her unalterable belief in the  evil omen.    At her command the house was searched, the servants cross-questioned,  and every effort made to discover the identity of the apparition. All in  vain; the house was as usual, and not a man or maid but turned pale at  the idea of entering the gallery at midnight. At my lady's request, all  promised to say no more upon the mystery, and separated at last to such  sleep as they could enjoy.    Very grave were the faces gathered about the breakfast table next  morning, and very anxious the glances cast on Sir Jasper as he came in,  late as usual, looking uncommonly blithe and well. Nothing serious ever  made a deep impression on his mercurial nature. Treherne had more the  air of a doomed man, being very pale and worn, in spite of an occasional  gleam of happiness as he looked at Octavia. He haunted Jasper like a  shadow all the morning, much to that young gentleman's annoyance, for  both his mother and sister hung about him with faces of ill-dissembled  anxiety. By afternoon his patience gave out, and he openly rebelled  against the tender guard kept over him. Ringing for his horse he said  decidedly, \"I'm bored to death with the solemnity which pervades the  house today, so I'm off for a brisk gallop, before I lose my temper and  spirits altogether.\"    \"Come with me in the pony carriage, Jasper. I've not had a drive with  you for a long while, and should enjoy it so much,\" said my lady,  detaining him.    \"Mrs. Snowdon looks as if she needed air to revive her roses, and the  pony carriage is just the thing for her, so I will cheerfully resign my  seat to her,\" he answered laughing, as he forced himself from his  mother's hand.    \"Take the girls in the clarence. We all want a breath of air, and you  are the best whip we know. Be gallant and say yes, dear.\"    \"No, thank you, Tavie, that won't do. Rose and Blanche are both asleep,  and you are dying to go and do likewise, after your vigils last night.  As a man and a brother I beg you'll do so, and let me ride as I like.\"    \"Suppose you ask Annon to join you--\" began Treherne with well-assumed  indifference; but Sir Jasper frowned and turned sharply on him, saying,  half-petulantly, half-jocosely:    \"Upon my life I should think I was a boy or a baby, by the manner in  which you mount guard over me today. If you think I'm going to live in  daily fear of some mishap, you are all much mistaken. Ghost or no ghost,  I shall make merry while I can; a short life and a jolly one has always  been my motto, you know, so fare you well till dinnertime.\"    They watched him gallop down the avenue, and then went their different  ways, still burdened with a nameless foreboding. Octavia strolled into  the conservatory, thinking to refresh herself with the balmy silence  which pervaded the place, but Annon soon joined her, full of a lover's  hopes and fears.    \"Miss Treherne, I have ventured to come for my answer. Is my New Year to  be a blissful or a sad one?\" he asked eagerly.    \"Forgive me if I give you an unwelcome reply, but I must be true, and so  regretfully refuse the honor you do me,\" she said sorrowfully.    \"May I ask why?\"    \"Because I do not love you.\"    \"And you do love your cousin,\" he cried angrily, pausing to watch her  half-averted face.    She turned it fully toward him and answered, with her native sincerity,  \"Yes, I do, with all my heart, and now my mother will not thwart me, for  Maurice has saved my life, and I am free to devote it all to him.\"    \"Happy man, I wish I had been a cripple!\" sighed Annon. Then with a  manful effort to be just and generous, he added heartily, \"Say no more,  he deserves you; I want no sacrifice to duty; I yield, and go away,  praying heaven to bless you now and always.\"    He kissed her hand and left her to seek my lady and make his adieus, for  no persuasion could keep him. Leaving a note for Sir Jasper, he hurried  away, to the great relief of Treherne and the deep regret of Blanche,  who, however, lived in hopes of another trial later in the season.    \"Here comes Jasper, Mamma, safe and well,\" cried Octavia an hour or two  later, as she joined her mother on the terrace, where my lady had been  pacing restlessly to and fro nearly ever since her son rode away.    With a smile of intense relief she waved her handkerchief as he came  clattering up the drive, and seeing her he answered with hat and hand.  He usually dismounted at the great hall door, but a sudden whim made him  ride along the wall that lay below the terrace, for he was a fine  horseman, and Mrs. Snowdon was looking from her window. As he  approached, the peacocks fled screaming, and one flew up just before the  horse's eyes as his master was in the act of dismounting. The spirited  creature was startled, sprang partway up the low, broad steps of the  terrace, and, being sharply checked, slipped, fell, and man and horse  rolled down together.    Never did those who heard it forget the cry that left Lady Treherne's  lips as she saw the fall. It brought out both guests and servants, to  find Octavia recklessly struggling with the frightened horse, and my  lady down upon the stones with her son's bleeding head in her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#14)"],[1,"sions:    none (all rayons are under direct republic jurisdiction)  Independence:    23 September 1991 (from Soviet Union)  Constitution:    adopted NA April 1978; post-Soviet constitution not yet adopted  Legal system:    based on civil law system  National holiday:    NA  Political parties and leaders:    Armenian National Movement, Husik LAZARYAN, chairman; National Democratic    Union; National Self-Determination Association; Armenian Democratic Liberal    Organization, Ramkavar AZATAKAN, chairman; Dashnatktsutyan Party (Armenian    Revolutionary Federation, ARF), Rouben MIRZAKHANIN; Chairman of    Parliamentary opposition - Mekhak GABRIYELYAN; Christian Democratic Union;    Constitutional Rights Union; Republican Party  Suffrage:    18 years of age; universal  Elections:   President:    last held 16 October 1991 (next to be held NA); results - Levon Akopovich    TER-PETROSYAN 86%; radical nationalists about 7%; note - Levon TER-PETROSYAN    was elected Chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet 4 August 1990   Supreme Soviet:    last held 20 May 1990 (next to be held NA); results - percent of vote by    party NA; seats - (240 total) non-aligned 149, Armenian National Movement    52, Armenian Democratic Liberal Organization 14, Dashnatktsutyan 12,    National Democratic Union 9, Christian Democratic Union 1, Constitutional    Rights Union 1, National Self-Determination Association 1, Republican Party    1  Executive branch:    president, council of ministers, prime minister  Legislative branch:    unicameral Supreme Soviet  Judicial branch:    Supreme Court  Leaders:   Chief of State:    President Levon Akopovich TER-PETROSYAN (since 16 October 1991), Vice    President Gagik ARUTYUNYAN (since 16 October 1991)    *Armenia, Government     Head of Government:   Prime Minister Hrant BAGRATYAN (since NA February 1993); Supreme Soviet    Chairman Babken ARARKTSYAN (since NA 1990)  Member of:    BSEC, CIS, CSCE, EBRD, IBRD, ICAO, IMF, NACC, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO,    UPU, WHO  Diplomatic representation in US:   chief of mission:    Ambassador Rouben SHUGARIAN   chancery:    122 C Street NW, Suite 360, Washington, DC 20001   telephone:    (202) 628-5766  US diplomatic representation:   chief of mission:    Ambassador Designate Harry GILMORE   embassy:    18 Gen Bagramian, Yerevan   mailing address:    use embassy street address   telephone:    (7) (885) 215-1122, 215-1144   FAX:    (7) (885) 215-1122  Flag:    three equal horizontal bands of red (top), blue, and gold    *Armenia, Economy    Overview:    Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,    machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to    sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the    republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the    Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered    Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed    about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of    Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of    the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of    nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are    largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high    dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of    transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is attributable largely    to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular importance was the    shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links to Russia through    Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.
