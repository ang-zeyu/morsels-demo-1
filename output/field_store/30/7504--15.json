I kept my bed during the Conference; but at the  close, several Elders being about to take their journey to Ohio, I  determined to go with them. I requested the Elders, therefore, to  lay their hands on me and pray. They did so. I was instantly  healed, and the next morning started in company with Elder Levi  Hancock, a journey of twelve hundred miles on foot.    I gained strength at every step, and the second evening, after  wading through the snow about six inches deep for some ten miles, I  was enabled to address a congregation for the first time in several  months.    I now parted with Levi Hancock, and had John Murdock for a  fellow traveller. We passed down the south side of the Missouri  river, among a thin settlement of people--mostly very ignorant but  extremely hospitable. Some families were entirely dressed in skins,  without any other clothing; including ladies young and old.  Buildings were generally without glass windows, and the door open  in winter for a light. We preached, and warned the people, and  taught them as well as we could.    While ministering in these settlements, and exposed to a heavy  snow storm, brother John Murdock was taken sick with a heavy fever;  this caused us to stop early in the day among strangers, in a small  log cabin consisting of one room; we held a meeting in the evening,  and then had a bed made down on the floor, before the fire. Before  morning brother Murdock was much better, but I was seized with a  most dreadful chill, followed by a heavy turn of fever; morning  found me unable to rise or speak. As the bed was in the way, they  lifted it by the four corners, with me on it, and placed it in the  back part of the room, on another bed. Here I lay, entirely  helpless with a burning fever, during which I distinctly heard a  dialogue between John Murdock and the lady of the house; she  upbraiding us as impostors thrown upon them at this inclement  season, while they were out of milling and of wood, and but illy  prepared for such a burden; that one was sick the night before, and  now the other was taken down; that it was six miles to the next  house, deep snow and no road broke, and we would probably be on  their hands for weeks.    To these inhospitable remarks brother Murdock mildly replied,  trying to soothe the woman; reasoning with her, and telling her  that brother Parley would soon be better, and then we would go our  way.    This dialogue gave me such a sense of unwelcome, and I pitied  brother Murdock to that degree for having to stay with such spirits  on my account, that I felt I could endure it no longer. With the  utmost effort I roused myself sufficiently to call brother Murdock  to my bed, whispering to him to lay hands on me unobserved, so as  not to be seen or overheard. He did so; I then asked him to give me  a drink of water. The effort had been too much, I swooned away  while he was gone for the water; he could hardly arouse me  sufficiently to drink of it; it was like waking from the dead. I  drank of it, bounded on my feet, dressed myself, put on my shoes  and hat, and told him I was ready to start. The family all  marvelled; one exclaimed, \"what a strange disease; it could not be  fever, and then be cured in an instant.\" We gave no explanations,  but started on our journey up a steep hill, in the deep snow, in  the midst of their urgings to stay to breakfast, or at least have a  cup of coffee. I said nothing, but thought to myself: ye  hypocrites, to murmur as you have, and then ask me to stay and eat.    We travelled on for some miles nearly in silence--I waiting all  the while for brother Murdock to make some remarks referring to our  inhospitable treatment, and the dialogue with the mistress of the  house. At last I broke silence. Said I, \"Brother Murdock, how did  you feel to be talked to by that woman? I thought you bore it with  great patience, and I pitied you from my heart, or I never should  have had faith and courage to be thus healed and start my journey.\"    He replied that no such conversation had occurred between him  and the lady, nor had she uttered one word indicative of any such  inhospitable feeling.    \"Well,\" said I, \"I heard it articulated in plain English by some  two persons perfectly imitating her voice and yours; it was no  imagination, or raging delirium of a fever. I can swear I heard a  conversation to that effect for a length of time.    \"If it was not the lady and yourself, then it was something from  an invisible world, which clearly revealed to me the spirit of our  hostess.\"    We reached the next house; I was a well man; found good  quarters, and we were kindly and hospitably entertained for some  days.    Pursuing our journey, we arrived at St. Louis, were kindly  received by some citizens of that place, and held meeting with  them. They conveyed us over the Mississippi free of charge, and we  continued our journey, preaching by the way. We arrived at length  at Vandalia, the then capital of Illinois. Here we were invited to  a hotel, where we sojourned free of charge, and preached to a good  audience in the Presbyterian meeting house. Next morning resuming  our journey, we crossed the Okah river on a bridge, but the bottoms  for two or three miles were overflowed to various depths, from six  inches to three or four feet, and frozen over, except in the main  channels, with a coat of ice, which we had to break by lifting our  feet to the surface at every step. This occupied some hours and  called into requisition our utmost strength, and sometimes we were  entirely covered with water. At length we got through in safety and  came to a house where we warmed and dried our clothes and took some  whiskey. Our legs and feet had lost all feeling, became benumbed,  and were dreadfully bruised and cut with the ice.    On the next day we had to cross a plain fifteen miles in length,  without a house, a tree, or any kind of shelter; a cold northwest  wind was blowing, and the ground covered with snow and ice. We had  made two or three miles into the plain when I was attacked with a  severe return of my old complaint, which had confined me so many  months in Jackson County, and from which I had recovered by a  miracle at the outset of this journey--I mean the fever and ague.    I travelled and shook, and shook and travelled, till I could  stand it no longer; I vomited severely several times, and finally  fell down on the snow, overwhelmed with fever, and became helpless  and nearly insensible. This was about seven or eight miles from the  nearest house.    Brother John Murdock laid his hands on me and prayed in the name  of Jesus; and, taking me by the hand, he commanded me with a loud  voice, saying: \"In the name of Jesus of Nazareth arise and walk!\" I  attempted to arise, I staggered a few paces, and was about falling  again when I found my fever suddenly depart and my strength come. I  walked at the rate of about four miles per hour, arrived at a  house, and was sick no more.    We continued our journey, preaching by the way, and crossing the  Wabash at Vincennes, we stopped in that vicinity for several days,  drawing crowded houses. Here we met with Elders Dustin and Bebee,  who left Jackson County, Missouri, when we did, and for the same  purpose. \"Well, brethren, how do you do?\" said we to them.    \"Tolerably well; only we have spent ten dollars each which was  given us by the Bishop when we started, and we have sold books and  spent the avails of them; and besides this we have been compelled  to borrow money in a certain branch of the Church, and have spent  that also; and we think it hard to travel for the public good and  this at our own charges.\"    \"Ah!\" said I, \"and how is this? we have not yet spent the first  cent since we left the Church in Jackson County; nor shall we have  any occasion for any spending money for weeks to come. Where did  you stay last night?\"    \"In the large village of Washington.\"    \"Did you preach to the people?\"    \"Yes; in the Court House.\"    \"Did they charge you for your keeping?\"    \"Yes. A dollar and a quarter.\"    \"Well, we are going there tonight, and, although entire  strangers, we shall be well entertained free of charge, preach or  no preach.\"    \"How do you do it?\" said they.    \"O, we hold up our heads like honest men; go to the best houses,  call for the best they have, make known our calling, pray with, or  preach to them, ask for their bill on taking leave, but they will  take nothing from us; but always invite us to call again.\"    \"Well, they will not treat you so in Washington tonight; you will have  to pay a good round sum.\"    \"Well, we shall see.\"    We took leave of them and of the good people where we had been  preaching, having first sent an appointment by the mail carrier,  that if the inhabitants of Washington would get together we would  address them that evening.    We entered the town at dark, stopped at a hotel, called for  lodging and supper and a room for ourselves; and asked the landlord  if a meeting had been got up for us. He said the mail carrier  brought the news of our appointment, but he believed it had been  neglected to be given out; was very sorry, made many apologies, and  still offered to have the bell rung and the people assembled if we  wished. We told him we were glad of an opportunity to rest, and did  not wish a meeting at so late an hour.    We retired to our room and made no further acquaintance. Next  morning on taking leave, we asked what was to pay. He answered,  \"not anything,\" said we were welcome to his hospitality at any  time, and bid us call again.    Leaving Washington, we were next entertained by a very  hospitable preacher of the Christian order, whose name I have  forgotten. We tarried at his house a week or two, and preached to  crowded congregations in all the region; he frequently going with  us to introduce us and open the way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#14)"],[1," in that trade.  She worked  in several places, but finally went back to her home.    At the age of 18 Inez met with what, according to her family, was  a decisive event in her life.  She was in a trolley car accident;  after being knocked down she was unconscious for some time.  No  definite injury was recorded.  Her family marked an entire change  of character from that time.  They say she then began lying in  the minutest detail about people and seemed to believe in her own  falsifications.  Besides this she started the roving tendency  which she has shown ever since.      The extensive information which we have received concerning the  later history of this remarkable case we can only take space to  give in summary.  We know definitely that Inez has received  attention, during periods varying from a few days to six months,  in no less than 18 different hospitals.  Besides this she has  been under the care of physicians at least a score of times.  Her  swindling in this matter was so flagrant in one eastern city to  which she had journeyed that she was handled through the police  court and was sentenced to a state hospital for the insane for a  term of 6 months.  The charge was that she was an idle person and  a beggar, and she was regarded as perhaps being unbalanced.  The  report from this town is that she would be taken with ``spells of  apparent violent illness on the street, in the trolley cars, at  railroad stations, and so be carried to various hospitals and  doctors' homes.''  She has visited numerous cities, getting her  sustenance largely through hospitals and physicians.    After being admitted into one famous hospital and showing some of  her curious manifestations she was transferred to a state  institution in the vicinity to be studied for insanity.  Correspondence with one physician tells the story of how five  years ago he was called from a medical meeting to attend this  ``girl'' who had been taken from a trolley car into his home.  She was apparently suffering great pain in the region of the old  appendicitis scar and she was conveyed in an ambulance to a  hospital.  After investigation for a few days, it was decided she  was hysterical or a simulator.    On numerous occasions her feigned illness has been so apparently  overcoming that she has had to be transferred in an ambulance to  a hospital.  One of her usual performances has been to get into  some home or institution and then keep others awake all night  with her signs of distress.  It is interesting that she has used  the same methods over and over again, but has been adroit enough  to vary the illnesses which she has simulated.  At one time  investigation in a hospital seemed to show that she was  neurasthenic.  She has been given chances in homes for  convalescents, but has never maintained herself in such a place  for long.  We note she was sent back from one of these to the  main hospital on account of having vomited the medicine she had  been given.  In fact, she has repeatedly been found resisting the  treatment which had been prescribed.    The record of admission and treatment given in one hospital is of  peculiar interest.  She was received there four years ago and  evidently had been unable just previously to take care of herself  properly on account of roaming.  Her clothing was dirty and her  head unclean.  She was found to have the old appendicitis scar,  which contained a small sinus.  She remained in bed after  admission, complaining of much pain in her abdomen, not well  localized however, and would lie moaning, crying, and rolling  across the bed.  She was then running a slight temperature.  After a time an operation was decided upon and a hairpin was  found in the abdominal wall, undoubtedly inserted through the  scar by the patient herself.  (The findings of the surgeon in  Chicago, then, revealed a repeated performance.)    At another place the patient maintained she was unable to  urinate, but at the same time strongly resisted catheterization.  From the variability of her complaint it was found it could not  be caused by a local condition, and examination showed no reason  for the difficulty.  Analysis of her symptoms undertaken at this  time led to several stories, one about urethritis, which Inez  claimed to have contracted from her brother at 3 years; an  episode when she had received a great fright during micturition;  an incident when she had seen a man exposed when she went to the  toilet.  (Of course, our experience with this type of case leads  us to appreciate the difficulties of psychological analysis with  extreme liars.)    On one occasion she entered a hospital, claiming to have been  recently injured; she had been taken in a supposed fainting  condition from a car.  Then it was she maintained that she had  been struck by an iron bar and that a spike had entered her back.  She also claimed at this time to have had her toes frozen.  Study  of the case here, too, showed no signs of injury or frost bite.  On another occasion she told of having been dropped by a nurse  while being lifted from a bed.  Altogether her stories and her  simulations have been convincing enough to get for her on many  occasions good attention during at least a few days.    We can get no account of true hysterical signs being discovered  by any one.  There has been no showing of anything but that she  is a liar and a simulator.  In the hospital records the portions  devoted to previous history are thoroughly vitiated by her  untruthfulness, and they contain statements which offer great  contradictions, one to the other.    Inez has been observed, then, for two long periods by  psychiatrists.  While at the end of neither period were the  observers willing to state that the young woman was compos  mentis, still their verdict in this matter had to be made up from  considerations of her social behavior rather than from what they  were able to discern by direct observation of her mental  processes.  From one case-record we read that ``The patient was  quiet, pleasant, and agreeable, replied promptly and  intelligently to questions, and talked spontaneously of her  affairs.  She was quite clear as to the environment, had  apparently a satisfactory memory, with the exception of a recent  period preceding admission.  Her statements, too, were probably  not altogether truthful, but frequently a reason for the  untruthfulness was made out.  She thought that her mind was all  right, but complained of having occasional difficulty in  thinking.''    Another prolonged study of her mental status was made four years  ago.  From the record we learn that there were no apparent  reactions to hallucinations.  Consciousness was clear and the  patient was completely oriented for time, place, and persons.  The train of thought was coherent and relevant.  Questions were  readily answered and attention easily held.  Memory was fair for  most events.  School knowledge was reasonably well retained.  Judgment, to this observer, seemed impaired, although no definite  delusions could be elicited.  Emotionally she was found more or  less irritable, fault finding, and at times a trifle despondent.  (Certainly the latter would be a natural reaction under the  circumstances.)  Often, however, she was found cheerful and  contented.  No special volitional disturbances were noted.  Was  found to act in an hysterical manner when she felt ill.  She was  neat, tidy, and cleanly in her habits.  Appetite was good and she  slept well.  Such was the report from the institution where she  was held for six months.  There was no material change in her  condition during this time; she showed herself very proficient  with the needle; she was discharged when her sentence expired.    We note a statement from one hospital that this ``girl'' gave no  evidence of having had any direct sexual experience, or that she  had ruminated much over these matters.  Her story about frequent  fainting attacks given at this time was not corroborated by  observation.  The diagnosis from one hospital was neurasthenia,  but investigation of her case in most places seems to have led  merely to the conclusion that she was a tremendous liar.    Notwithstanding our long record of this case and the accounts  which have been handed in to us of experiences with her in other  localities, we do not presume to know a tithe of the places Inez  has been to or lived in during the last eight years.  It is more  than likely that she herself would find it difficult to give any  accurate account of her rovings.  At the time we first saw Inez  her parents had not heard from her for about three years.  Shortly after this we found that she had renewed correspondence  with them and had sent them money as if she were now prosperous.  Her family have all along, in spite of her stories, been poor.  At one period she visited several cities in the southeastern  states and was at a hospital in one of them.  In Charleston there  is a family by the name of B. (spelled the same as the name of  the people she was with in Tennessee).  These were the people  Inez asked us to write to in an appeal, because they had long  known her and were wealthy, for a chance to get an education.  She stated they were immediate relatives of the B.'s in  Tennessee, and that she had visited them once at their fine home  in Charleston for three or four months.  These people replied to  us that they had been receiving letters for years from  associations and organizations in regard to this girl whom they  had never seen.  They were convinced she had assumed their name  because she had understood they were well-to-do and liberal.  ``We know nothing about her education, but judge she has enough  to dupe people with; posing as poor at one time, sick at another,  and anxious for an education at another, as you inform us.''    From another correspondent with whom Inez had lived in Alabama  for a few weeks we had a marvelous tale which they heard from "]]]
