The book  which was discovered in the Temple in the reign of Josiah, and which  is entitled \"the Book of the Law of Jehovah by the hand of Moses,\" was  substantially, it would seem, the same volume, though it may afterward  have undergone some revision by Ezra. The present Jews, as we have  already seen, usually call the whole by the name of Torah, i. e., \"the  Law,\" or Torath Mosheh, \"the Law of Moses.\" (Smith's Old Testament  History, p.. 654.)    2. _Greek Titles of the Books:_ \"The division of the whole work into  five parts was probably made by the Greek translators, for the titles  of the several books are not of Hebrew, but of Greek origin. The Hebrew  names are merely taken from the first words of each book, and in the  first instance only designated particular sections, and not whole  books.\" (Dr. Smith's Old Testament History, p. 654.)    3. _The Question of Authorship:_ \"Till the middle of the last  century (eighteenth) it was the general opinion of both Jews and  Christians that the whole of the Pentateuch was written by Moses,  with the exception of a few manifestly later additions--such as the  thirty-fourth chapter of Deuteronomy, which gives the account of  Moses' death. The first attempt to call in question the popular belief  was made by Astruc, doctor and professor of medicine in the Royal  College at Paris, and court physician to Louis XIV. He had observed  that throughout the Book of Genesis, and as far as the sixth chapter  of Exodus, traces were to be found of two original documents, each  characterized by a distinct use of the names of God; the one by the  name Elohim, and the other by the name Jehovah. Besides these two  principal documents, he supposed Moses to have made use of ten others  in the composition of the earlier part of his work. The path traced  by Astruc has been followed by numerous German writers. * * * * * It  is sufficient here to state that there is sufficient evidence for  believing that the main bulk of the Pentateuch, at any rate, was  written by Moses, though he probably availed himself of existing  documents in the composition of the earlier part of the work. Some  detached portions would appear to be of later origin; and when we  remember how entirely during some periods of Jewish history, the Law  seems to have been forgotten, and again how necessary it would be after  the seventy years of exile to explain some of its archaisms, and to add  here and there short notes to make it more intelligible to the people,  nothing can be more natural than to suppose that such later additions  were made by Ezra and Nehemiah.\" (Dr. Smith's Old Testament History,  pp. 653-655.)    The same conclusion is reached by James Robertson, D.D., in the Bible  Treasury; and also by Prof. Samuel Colcord Bartlett, D.D., of the  Theological Seminary, Chicago, in Smith's Bible Dictionary, Vol. IV,  p. 243. The question is considered at some length in the Young Men's  Manual, 1903-4 (No. 7), chap. I.    4. _Prophecy of Moses:_ \"And when Moses had recapitulated whatsoever  he had done for the preservation of the people, both in their wars  and in peace, and had composed them a body of laws, and procured them  an excellent form of government, he foretold, as God had declared to  him, That if they transgressed that institution for the worship of  God, they should experience the following miseries: their land should  be full of weapons of war from their enemies, and their cities should  be overthrown, and their temple should be burnt; that they should be  sold for slaves to such men as would have no pity on them in their  afflictions: that they would then repent, when that repentance would no  way profit them under their sufferings. Yet (said he) will that God who  founded your nation, restore your cities to your citizens, with their  temple also, and you shall lose these advantages not once only, but  often.\" (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, p. 97.)    5. _Suggested Readings:_ It is expected, of course, that the student  will read all the books of the Pentateuch during the weeks which the  lessons upon it will occupy; and in addition to that, so far as he  may have access to them, read also the references given in the lesson  analysis, which, in the main, give summaries, analyses, literary  criticism, estimate theological and prophetical values of the separate  books, etc. All the Bibles having \"Helps,\" published in connection  with the sacred text have analyses and comments upon the books of  the Pentateuch; and these as far as possible should be read and  compared. For their historical value the first four books of Josephus'  Antiquities should also be read.        LESSON IV.    _THE PENTATEUCH._      ANALYSIS.

God became the God of Israel, everything done to  establish religion, tabernacle made for his residence. Defection from  religion high treason. Hence complete separation from all nations.  Moses was but a mediator between God and his people; proper title  legislator of the Israelites and their deliverer from the Egyptians.  * * * * For administration of justice Moses divided people in tens,  fifties, hundreds, thousands, and placed judges over each. Mode  taken from Egypt. Amongst the higher of these judges there was much  political power likewise. * * * * Each tribe had a sort of independent  government, with its own magistrates and representatives; sometimes  acted without aid or sanction of others, (e. g., tribe of Benjamin  protected criminals of Gibeah and fought against others.) * * * * *  Sometimes several tribes acted together without others. * * * * *  What the influence of such a government? Exceedingly favorable to  development of character and individual energies. Not favorable for  harmony or tranquility.\" (Ancient and Modern Nations, Dew, pp. 13-14.)    2. _The Law of Moses:_ \"Though new in its general conception, it was  probably not wholly new in its materials. Neither in his material nor  his spiritual providence does God proceed _per saltum_. There must  necessarily have been, before the Law, commandments and revelations  of a fragmentary character, under which Israel had hitherto grown up.  Indications of such are easily found, both of a ceremonial and moral  nature; as, for example, in the penalties against murder, adultery,  and fornication (Gen. ix. 6; xxxviii. 8), in the distinction of clean  and unclean animals (Gen. viii. 20), and probably in the observance of  the Sabbath (Ex. xvi. 23, 27, 29.) But, even without such indications,  our knowledge of the existence of Israel as a distinct community in  Egypt would necessitate the conclusion, that it must have been guided  by some laws of its own, growing out of the old patriarchal customs,  which would be preserved with oriental tenacity, and gradually becoming  methodized by the progress of circumstances. Nor would it be possible  for the Israelites to be in contact with an elaborate system of ritual  and law, such as that which existed in Egypt, without being influenced  by its general principles, and, in less degree, by its minuter details.  As they approached nearer to the condition of a nation they would  be more and more likely to modify their patriarchal customs by the  adoption from Egypt of laws which were fitted for national existence.  This being so, it is hardly conceivable that the Mosaic legislation  should have embodied none of these earlier materials. It is clear,  even to human wisdom, that the only constitution, which can be  efficient and permanent, is one which has grown up slowly, and so been  assimilated to the character of a people. It is the peculiar mark of  legislative genius to mold by fundamental principles, and animate by a  higher inspiration, materials previously existing in a cruder state.  The necessity for this lies in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#14)"],[1,"feet  from the ground. The main supports were bark-lashed to the large  branches of the family tree. Over this there was a rude roof of  long grass, which had a fairly intelligent slope. As a shelter  from rain, the Jackoon house left much to be desired. The scanty  loin cloths of the habitants knew no such thing as wash-day or  line. With all its drawbacks, however, this habitation was far  more adequate to the needs of its builders than the cold brush  rabbit-forms of the Patagonian canoe Indians.    We now come to a tribe which has reduced the problem of housing  and home life to its lowest common denominator. The Poonans of  Central Borneo, discovered and described by Carl Bock, build _no  houses of any kind,_ not even huts of green branches; and their  only overture toward the promotion of personal comfort in the home  is a five-foot grass mat spread upon the sodden earth, to lie upon  when at rest. And this, in a country where in the so-called \"dry  season\" it rains half the time, and in the \"wet season\" all the  time.    The Poonans have rudely-made spears for taking the wild pig, deer  and smaller game, their clothes consist of bark cloth, around the  loins only. They know no such thing as agriculture, and they live  off the jungle.    It was said some years ago that a similarly primitive jungle tribe  of Ceylon, known as the Veddahs, could count no more than five,  that they could not comprehend \"day after to-morrow,\" and that  their vocabulary was limited to about 200 words.    It is very probable that the language of the Poonans and the  Jackoons is equally limited. And what are we to conclude from  all the foregoing? Briefly, I should say that the architectural  skill of the orioles, the caciques and the weaver birds is greater  than that of the South Patagonia native, the Jackoon and the  Poonan. I should say that those bird homes yield to their makers  more comfort and protection, and a better birth-rate, than are  yielded by the homes of those ignorant, unambitious and  retrogressive tribes of men now living and thinking, and supposed  to be possessed of reasoning powers. If the whole truth could be  known, I believe it would be found that the stock of ideas  possessed and used by the groups of highly-endowed birds would  fully equal the ideas of such tribes of simple-minded men as those  mentioned. If caught young, those savages could be trained by  civilized men, and taught to perform many tricks, but so can  chimpanzees and elephants.    Curiously enough, it is a common thing for even the higher types  of civilized men to make in home-building just as serious mistakes  as are made by wild animals and savages. For example, among the  men of our time it is a common mistake to build in the wrong  place, to build entirely too large or too ugly, and to build a  Colossal Burden instead of a real Home. From many a palace there  stands forth the perpetual question: \"_Why_ did he do it?\"    Any reader who at any time inclines toward an opinion that the  author is unduly severe on the mentality of the human race, even  as it exists today in the United States, is urged to read in the  _Scientific Monthly_ for January, 1922, an article by  Professor L. M. Tennan entitled \"Adventures in Stupidity.--A  Partial Analysis of the Intellectual Inferiority of a College  Student.\" He should particularly note the percentages on page 34  in the second paragraph under the subtitle \"The Psychology of  Stupidity.\"          VIII    THE MENTAL STATUS OF THE ORANG-UTAN      My first ownership of a live orang-utan began in 1878, in the  middle of the Simujan River, Borneo, where for four Spanish  dollars I became the proud possessor of a three-year old male. No  sooner was the struggling animal deposited in the bottom of my own  boat than it savagely seized the calf of my devoted leg and  endeavored to bite therefrom a generous cross section. My leggings  and my leech stockings saved my life. That implacable little beast  never gave up; and two days later it died,--apparently to spite  me.    My next orang was a complete reverse of No. 1. He liked not the  Dyaks who brought him to me, but in the first moment of our  acquaintance he adopted me as his foster-father, and loved me like  a son. Throughout four months of jungle vicissitudes he stuck to  me. He was a high-class orang,--and be it known that many orangs  are thin-headed scrubs, who never amount to anything. His skull  was wide, his face was broad, and he had a dome of thought like a  statesman. He had a fine mind, and I am sure I could have taught  him everything that any ape could learn.    During the four months that he lived with me I taught him, almost  without effort, many things that were necessary in our daily life.  Even the Dyaks recognized the fact that the \"Old Man\" was an orang  (or \"mias\") of superior mind, and some of them traveled far to see  him. Unfortunately the exigencies of travel and work compelled me  to present him to an admiring friend in India. Mr. Andrew Carnegie  and his then partner, Mr. J. W. Vandevorst, convoyed my Old Man  and another small orang from Singapore to Colombo, Ceylon, whence  they were shipped on to Madras, received there by my old friend A.  G. R. Theobald,--and presented at the court of the Duke of  Buckingham.    Up to a comparatively recent date, the studies of the  psychologists that have been devoted to the minds of animals below  man, have been chiefly concerned with low and common types.  Comparatively few investigators have found it possible to make  extensive and prolonged observations of the most intelligent wild  animals of the world, even in zoological gardens, and their  observations on wild animals in a state of nature seem to have  been even more circumscribed. I know only three who have studied  any of the great apes.    In attempting to fathom the mental capacity and the mental  processes of some of the highest mammals, there is the same  superior degree of interest attaching to the study of wild species  that the ethnologist finds in the study of savage races of men  that have been unspoiled by civilization. Obviously, it is more  interesting to fathom the mind of a creature in an absolute state  of nature than of one whose ancestors have been bred and reared in  the trammels of domestication and for many successive generations  have bowed to the will of man. The natural fury of the Atlantic  walrus, when attacked, is much more interesting as a psychologic  study than is the inbred rage of the bull-dog; and the remarkable  defensive tactics of the musk-ox far surpass in interest the  vagaries of range cattle.    For several reasons, the great apes, and particularly the  chimpanzees and orang-utans, are the most interesting subjects for  psychologic study of all the wild-animal species with which the  writer is acquainted. Primarily this is due to the fact that  intellectually and temperamentally, as well as anatomically,  these animals stand very near to man himself, and closely resemble  him. The great apes mentioned can give visible expression to a  wide range of thoughts and emotions,    The voice of the adult orang-utan is almost absent, and only  sufficient to display on rare occasions. What little there is of  it, in animals over six years of age, is very deep and guttural,  and may best be described as a deep-bass roar. Under excitement  the orang can produce a roar by inhalation. Young orangs under two  years of age often whine, or shriek or scream with anger, like  excited human children, but with their larger growth that vocal  power seems to leave them.    Despite the difference in temperament and quickness in delivery, I  regard the measure of the orang-utan's mental capacity as being  equal to that of the chimpanzee; but the latter is, and always  will remain, the more alert and showy animal. The superior feet of  the chimpanzee in bipedal work is for that species a great  advantage, and the longer toes of the orang are a handicap.  Although the orang's sanguine temperament is far more comforting  to a trainer than the harum-scarum nervous vivacity of the  chimpanzee, the value of the former is overbalanced, on the stage,  by the superior acting of the chimp. For these reasons the  trainers generally choose the chimp for stage education.    The chimpanzee is not only nervous and quick in thought and in  action, but it is equally so _in temper._ It will play with  any good friend to almost any extent, but the moment it suspects  malicious unfairness, or what it regards as a \"mean trick,\" it  instantly becomes angry and resentful. Once when I attempted to  take from our large black-faced chimpanzee, called Soko, a small  lump of rubber which I feared she might swallow, my efforts were  kindly but firmly thwarted. At last, when I diverted her by small  offerings of chocolate, and at the right moment sought by a  strategic movement to snatch the rubber from her, the palpable  unfairness of the attempt caused the animal instantly to fly into  a towering passion, and seek to wreak vengeance upon me. Her lips  drew far back in a savage snarl, and she denounced my perfidy by  piercing cries of rage and indignation. She also did her utmost to  seize and drag me forcibly within reach of her teeth, for the  punishment which she felt that I deserved.    A large male orang-utan named Dohong, under a similar test,  revealed a very different mental attitude. He dexterously snatched  a valuable watch-charm from a visitor who stood inside the railing  of his cage, and fled with it to the top of his balcony. As  quickly as possible I thrust my handkerchief between the bars, and  waved it vigorously, to attract him. At once the animal came down  to me, to secure another trophy, and before he realized his  position I successfully snatched the charm from him, and restored  it unharmed to its owner. Dohong seemed to regard the episode as a  good joke. Without manifesting any resentment he turned a"]]]
