These  coats-of-arms could be read, where a scroll would be meaningless, and  the bowman, like most men of his age, was well versed in the common  symbols of heraldry.    \"There is the Saracen's head of Sir Bernard Brocas,\" quoth he. \"I saw  him last at the ruffle at Poictiers some ten years back, when he bore  himself like a man. He is the master of the King's horse, and can sing  a right jovial stave, though in that he cannot come nigh to Sir John  Chandos, who is first at the board or in the saddle. Three martlets on a  field azure, that must be one of the Luttrells. By the crescent upon it,  it should be the second son of old Sir Hugh, who had a bolt through his  ankle at the intaking of Romorantin, he having rushed into the fray ere  his squire had time to clasp his solleret to his greave. There too is  the hackle which is the old device of the De Brays. I have served under  Sir Thomas de Bray, who was as jolly as a pie, and a lusty swordsman  until he got too fat for his harness.\"    So the archer gossiped as the three wayfarers threaded their way among  the stamping horses, the busy grooms, and the knots of pages and squires  who disputed over the merits of their masters' horses and deer-hounds.  As they passed the old church, which stood upon a mound at the left-hand  side of the village street the door was flung open, and a stream of  worshippers wound down the sloping path, coming from the morning mass,  all chattering like a cloud of jays. Alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at  the sight of the open door; but ere he had finished an ave his comrades  were out of sight round the curve of the path, and he had to run to  overtake them.    \"What!\" he said, \"not one word of prayer before God's own open house?  How can ye hope for His blessing upon the day?\"    \"My friend,\" said Hordle John, \"I have prayed so much during the last  two months, not only during the day, but at matins, lauds, and the like,  when I could scarce keep my head upon my shoulders for nodding, that I  feel that I have somewhat over-prayed myself.\"    \"How can a man have too much religion?\" cried Alleyne earnestly. \"It is  the one thing that availeth. A man is but a beast as he lives from day  to day, eating and drinking, breathing and sleeping. It is only when  he raises himself, and concerns himself with the immortal spirit within  him, that he becomes in very truth a man. Bethink ye how sad a thing  it would be that the blood of the Redeemer should be spilled to no  purpose.\"    \"Bless the lad, if he doth not blush like any girl, and yet preach like  the whole College of Cardinals,\" cried the archer.    \"In truth I blush that any one so weak and so unworthy as I should  try to teach another that which he finds it so passing hard to follow  himself.\"    \"Prettily said, mon garcon. Touching that same slaying of the Redeemer,  it was a bad business. A good padre in France read to us from a scroll  the whole truth of the matter. The soldiers came upon him in the garden.  In truth, these Apostles of His may have been holy men, but they were of  no great account as men-at-arms. There was one, indeed, Sir Peter, who  smote out like a true man; but, unless he is belied, he did but clip  a varlet's ear, which was no very knightly deed. By these ten  finger-bones! had I been there with Black Simon of Norwich, and but one  score picked men of the Company, we had held them in play. Could we do  no more, we had at least filled the false knight, Sir Judas, so full of  English arrows that he would curse the day that ever he came on such an  errand.\"    The young clerk smiled at his companion's earnestness. \"Had He wished  help,\" he said, \"He could have summoned legions of archangels from  heaven, so what need had He of your poor bow and arrow? Besides, bethink  you of His own words--that those who live by the sword shall perish by  the sword.\"    \"And how could man die better?\" asked the archer. \"If I had my wish, it  would be to fall so--not, mark you, in any mere skirmish of the Company,  but in a stricken field, with the great lion banner waving over us and  the red oriflamme in front, amid the shouting of my fellows and the  twanging of the strings. But let it be sword, lance, or bolt that  strikes me down: for I should think it shame to die from an iron ball  from the fire-crake or bombard or any such unsoldierly weapon, which is  only fitted to scare babes with its foolish noise and smoke.\"    \"I have heard much even in the quiet cloisters of these new and dreadful  engines,\" quoth Alleyne. \"It is said, though I can scarce bring myself  to believe it, that they will send a ball twice as far as a bowman  can shoot his shaft, and with such force as to break through armor of  proof.\"    \"True enough, my lad. But while the armorer is thrusting in his  devil's-dust, and dropping his ball, and lighting his flambeau, I  can very easily loose six shafts, or eight maybe, so he hath no great  vantage after all. Yet I will not deny that at the intaking of a town  it is well to have good store of bombards. I am told that at Calais they  made dints in the wall that a man might put his head into. But surely,  comrades, some one who is grievously hurt hath passed along this road  before us.\"    All along the woodland track there did indeed run a scattered straggling  trail of blood-marks, sometimes in single drops, and in other places in  broad, ruddy gouts, smudged over the dead leaves or crimsoning the white  flint stones.    \"It must be a stricken deer,\" said John.    \"Nay, I am woodman enough to see that no deer hath passed this way this  morning; and yet the blood is fresh. But hark to the sound!\"    They stood listening all three with sidelong heads. Through the silence  of the great forest there came a swishing, whistling sound, mingled  with the most dolorous groans, and the voice of a man raised in a  high quavering kind of song. The comrades hurried onwards eagerly, and  topping the brow of a small rising they saw upon the other side the  source from which these strange noises arose.    A tall man, much stooped in the shoulders, was walking slowly with  bended head and clasped hands in the centre of the path. He was dressed  from head to foot in a long white linen cloth, and a high white cap  with a red cross printed upon it. His gown was turned back from his  shoulders, and the flesh there was a sight to make a man wince, for it  was all beaten to a pulp, and the blood was soaking into his gown and  trickling down upon the ground. Behind him walked a smaller man with his  hair touched with gray, who was clad in the same white garb. He intoned  a long whining rhyme in the French tongue, and at the end of every line  he raised a thick cord, all jagged with pellets of lead, and smote his  companion across the shoulders until the blood spurted again. Even as  the three wayfarers stared, however, there was a sudden change, for the  smaller man, having finished his song, loosened his own gown and handed  the scourge to the other, who took up the stave once more and lashed  his companion with all the strength of his bare and sinewy arm. So,  alternately beating and beaten, they made their dolorous way through the  beautiful woods and under the amber arches of the fading beech-trees,  where the calm strength and majesty of Nature might serve to rebuke the  foolish energies and misspent strivings of mankind.    Such a spectacle was new to Hordle John or to Alleyne Edricson; but the  archer treated it lightly, as a common matter enough.    \"These are the Beating Friars, otherwise called the Flagellants,\" quoth  he. \"I marvel that ye should have come upon none of them before, for  across the water they are as common as gallybaggers. I have heard that  there are no English among them, but that they are from France, Italy  and Bohemia. En avant, camarades! that we may have speech with them.\"    As they came up to them, Alleyne could hear the doleful dirge which the  beater was chanting, bringing down his heavy whip at the end of each  line, while the groans of the sufferer formed a sort of dismal chorus.  It was in old French, and ran somewhat in this way:            Or avant, entre nous tous freres          Battons nos charognes bien fort          En remembrant la grant misere          De Dieu et sa piteuse mort          Qui fut pris en la gent amere          Et vendus et trais a tort          Et bastu sa chair, vierge et dere          Au nom de ce battons plus fort.    Then at the end of the verse the scourge changed hands and the chanting  began anew.    \"Truly, holy fathers,\" said the archer in French as they came abreast of  them, \"you have beaten enough for to-day. The road is all spotted like a  shambles at Martinmas. Why should ye mishandle yourselves thus?\"    \"C'est pour vos peches--pour vos peches,\" they droned, looking at the  travellers with sad lack-lustre eyes, and then bent to their bloody  work once more without heed to the prayers and persuasions which were  addressed to them. Finding all remonstrance useless, the three comrades  hastened on their way, leaving these strange travellers to their dreary  task.    \"Mort Dieu!\" cried the bowman, \"there is a bucketful or more of my blood  over in France, but it was all spilled in hot fight, and I should think  twice before I drew it drop by drop as these friars are doing. By my  hilt! our young one here is as white as a Picardy cheese. What is amiss  then, mon cher?\"    \"It is nothing,\" Alleyne answered. \"My life has been too quiet, I am not  used to such sights.\"    \"Ma foi!\" the other cried, \"I have never yet seen a man who was so stout  of speech and yet so weak of heart.\"    \"Not so, friend,\" quoth big John; \"it is not weakness of heart for I  know the lad well.

The inflow, continually renewed,  of traffickers and cosmopolitan adventurers increased this confusion.  And so Carthage was a Babel of races, of costumes, of beliefs and ideas.  Augustin, who was at heart a mystic, but also a dialectician extremely fond  of showy discussions, found in Carthage a lively summary of the religions  and philosophies of his day. During these years of study and reflection he  captured booty of knowledge and observation which he would know how to make  use of in the future.    In the Carthage sanctuaries and schools, in the squares and the streets,  he could see pass the disciples of all the systems, the props of all the  superstitions, the devotees of all the religions. He heard the shrill  clamour of disputes, the tumult of fights and riots. When a man was at the  end of his arguments, he knocked down his opponent. The authorities had a  good deal of trouble to keep order. Augustin, who was an intrepid logician,  must have longed to take his share in these rows. But one cannot exactly  improvise a faith between to-day and to-morrow. While he awaited the  enlightenment of the truth, he studied the Carthaginian Babel.    First of all, there was the official religion, the most obvious and perhaps  the most brilliant, that of the Divinity of the Emperors, which was still  kept up even under the Christian Caesars. Each year, at the end of October,  the elected delegates of the entire province, having at their head the  _Sacerdos province_, the provincial priest, arrived at Carthage. Their  leader, clad in a robe broidered with palms, gold crown on head, made his  solemn entry into the city. It was a perfect invasion, each member dragging  in his wake a mob of clients and servants. The Africans, with their  taste for pomp and colour, seized the chance to give themselves over to a  display of ruinous sumptuosities: rich dresses, expensive horses splendidly  caparisoned, processions, sacrifices, public banquets, games at the circus  and amphitheatre. These strangers so overcrowded the city that the imperial  Government had to forbid them, under severe penalties, to stay longer  than five days. A very prudent measure! At these times, collisions were  inevitable between pagans and Christians. It was desirable to scatter such  crowds as soon as possible, for riots were always smouldering in their  midst.    No less thronged were the festivals of the Virgin of Heaven. A survival  of the national religion, these feasts were dear to the hearts of the  Carthaginians. Augustin went to them with his fellow-students. \"We trooped  there from every quarter,\" he says. There was a great gathering of people  in the interior court which led up to the temple. The statue, taken from  its sanctuary, was placed before the peristyle upon a kind of repository.  Wantons, arrayed with barbarous lavishness, danced around the holy  image; actors performed and sang hymns. \"Our eager eyes,\" Augustin adds  maliciously, \"rested in turn on the goddess, and on the girls, her  adorers.\" The Great Mother of the Gods, the Goddess of Mount Berecyntus,  was worshipped with similar license. Every year the people of Carthage went  to wash her solemnly in the sea. Her statue, carried in a splendid litter,  robed with precious stuffs, curled and farded, passed through the streets  of the city, with its guard of mummers and Corybants. These last, \"with  hair greasy from pomade, pale faces, and a loose and effeminate walk, held  out bowls for alms to the onlookers.\"    The devotion to Isis was yet another excuse for processions: the _Serapeum_  was a rival attraction to the temple of the Heavenly Maiden. If we may  trust Tertullian, the Africans swore only by Serapis. Possibly Mithras  had also worshippers in Carthage. Anyhow, the occult religions were fully  represented there. Miracle-working was becoming more and more the basis  even of paganism. Never had the soothsayers been more flourishing.  Everybody, in secret, pried into the entrails of the sacrificial victims,  or used magic spells. As to the wizards and astrologists, they did business  openly. Augustin himself consulted them, like all the Carthaginians. The  public credulity had no limits.    On the opposite side from the pagan worship, the sects which had sprung  from Christianity sprouted. True, Africa has given birth to but a small  number of heresies: the Africans had not the subtle mind of the Orientals  and they were not given to theorizing. But a good many of the Eastern  heresies had got into Carthage. Augustin must have still met Arians there,  although at this period Arianism was dying out in Africa. What is certain  is that orthodox Catholicism was in a very critical state. The Donatists  captured its congregations and churches; they were unquestionably in the  majority. They raised altar against altar. If Genethlius was the Catholic  bishop, the Donatist bishop was Parmenianus. And they claimed to be more  Catholic than their opponents. They boasted that they were the Church, the  single, the unique Church, the Church of Christ. But these schismatics  themselves were already splitting up into many sects. At the time Augustin  was studying at Carthage, Rogatus, Bishop of Tenes, had just broken  publicly with Parmenian's party. Another Donatist, Tyconius, published  books wherein he traversed many principles dear to his fellow-religionists.  Doubt darkened consciences. Amid these controversies, where was the truth?  Among whom did the Apostolic tradition dwell?    To put the finishing touch on this anarchy, a sect which likewise derived  from Christianity--Manicheeism--began to have numerous adepts in Africa.  Watched with suspicion by the Government, it concealed part of its  doctrine, the most scandalous and subversive. But the very mystery which  enveloped it, helped it to get adherents.    Among all these apostles preaching their gospel, these devotees beating  the drum before their god, these theologians reciprocally insulting and  excommunicating one another, Augustin brought the superficial scepticism of  his eighteenth year. He wanted no more of the religion in which his mother  had brought him up. He was a good talker, a clever dialectician; he was in  a hurry to emancipate himself, to win freedom for his way of thinking as  for his way of life; and he meant to enjoy his youth. With such gifts, and  with such dispositions, he could only choose among all these doctrines that  which would help most the qualities of his mind, at once flattering his  intellectual pretensions, and leaving his pleasure-loving instincts a loose  rein.          III    THE CARTHAGE STUDENT      However strong were the attractions of the great city, Augustin well knew  that he had not been sent there to amuse himself, or to trifle as an  amateur with philosophy. He was poor, and he had to secure his future--make  his fortune. His family counted on him. Neither was he ignorant of the  difficult position of his parents and by what sacrifices they had supplied  him with the means to finish his studies. Necessarily he was obliged to be  a student who worked.    With his extraordinary facility, he stood out at once among his  fellow-students. In the rhetoric school, where he attended lectures,  he was, he tells us, not only at the top, but he was the leader of his  companions. He led in everything. At that time, rhetoric was extremely  far-reaching: it had come to take in all the divisions of education,  including science and philosophy. Augustin claims to have learned all that  the masters of his time had to teach: rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, music,  mathematics. Having gone through the whole scholastic system, he thought of  studying law, and aided by his gift of words, to become a barrister. For a  gifted young man it was the shortest and surest road to money and honours.    Unhappily for him, hardly was he settled down at Carthage than his father  died. This made his future again problematical. How was he to keep up his  studies without the sums coming from his father? The affairs of Patricius  must have been left in the most parlous condition. But Monnica, clinging to  her ambitious plans for her son, knew how to triumph over all difficulties,  and she continued to send Augustin money. Romanianus, the Maecenas of  Thagaste, who was doubtless applied to by her, came once more to the rescue  of the hard-up student. The young man, set at ease about his expenses,  resumed light-heartedly his studious and dissipated life.    As a matter of fact, this family bereavement does not seem to have caused  him much grief. In the _Confessions_ he mentions the death of his father in  a few words, and, so to speak, in parenthesis, as an event long foreseen  without much importance. And yet he owed him a great deal. Patricius was  hard pressed, and he took immense trouble to provide the means for his  son's education. But with the fine egotism of youth, Augustin perhaps  thought it enough to have profited by his father's sacrifices, and  dispensed himself from gratitude. In any case, his affection for his father  must have been rather lukewarm; the natural differences between them ran  too deep. In these years, Monnica filled all the heart of Augustin.    But the influence of Monnica herself was very slight upon this grown-up  youth, eighteen years old. He had forgotten her lessons, and it did not  trouble him much if his conduct added to the worries of the widow, who was  now struggling with her husband's creditors. At heart he was a good son and  he deeply loved his mother, but inevitably the pressure of the life around  him swept him along.    He has pictured his companions for us, after his conversion, as terrible  blackguards. No doubt he is too severe. Those young men were neither better  nor worse than elsewhere. They were rowdy, as they were in the other cities  of the Empire, and as one always is at that age. Imperial"]]]
