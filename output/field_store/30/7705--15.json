(#14)"],[1,"old, thou cam'st to shore?\"--    \"It was the friar Gomita,\" he rejoin'd,  \"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,  Who had his master's enemies in hand,  And us'd them so that they commend him well.  Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd.  So he reports: and in each other charge  Committed to his keeping, play'd the part  Of barterer to the height:  with him doth herd  The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.  Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue  Is never weary.  Out! alas! behold  That other, how he grins!  More would I say,  But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.\"    Their captain then to Farfarello turning,  Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,  Rebuk'd him thus: \"Off! cursed bird!  Avaunt!\"--    \"If ye desire to see or hear,\" he thus  Quaking with dread resum'd, \"or Tuscan spirits  Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.  Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,  So that no vengeance they may fear from them,  And I, remaining in this self-same place,  Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear,  When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so  Our custom is to call each other up.\"    Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd,  Then wagg'd the head and spake: \"Hear his device,  Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.\"    Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store  Of nice-wove toils; \"Mischief forsooth extreme,  Meant only to procure myself more woe!\"    No longer Alichino then refrain'd,  But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:  \"If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot  Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat  My plumes.  Quit we the vantage ground, and let  The bank be as a shield, that we may see  If singly thou prevail against us all.\"    Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!    They each one turn'd his eyes to the other shore,  He first, who was the hardest to persuade.  The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,  Planted his feet on land, and at one leap  Escaping disappointed their resolve.    Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,  Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit  He therefore sped, exclaiming; \"Thou art caught.\"    But little it avail'd: terror outstripp'd  His following flight: the other plung'd beneath,  And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:  E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives  The falcon near, dives instant down, while he  Enrag'd and spent retires.  That mockery  In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew  After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;  And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd  His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke  In grapple close they join'd; but the other prov'd  A goshawk able to rend well his foe;    And in the boiling lake both fell.  The heat  Was umpire soon between them, but in vain  To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued  Their pennons.  Barbariccia, as the rest,  That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd  From the other coast, with all their weapons arm'd.  They, to their post on each side speedily  Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,  Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:  And we departing left them to that broil.          CANTO XXIII    IN silence and in solitude we went,  One first, the other following his steps,  As minor friars journeying on their road.    The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse  Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told  What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.  For language hath not sounds more like in sense,  Than are these chances, if the origin  And end of each be heedfully compar'd.  And as one thought bursts from another forth,  So afterward from that another sprang,  Which added doubly to my former fear.  For thus I reason'd: \"These through us have been  So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,  As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then  Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell  They shall pursue us, than the savage hound  Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws.\"    Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all  On end with terror, and look'd eager back.    \"Teacher,\" I thus began, \"if speedily  Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread  Those evil talons.  Even now behind  They urge us: quick imagination works  So forcibly, that I already feel them.\"    He answer'd: \"Were I form'd of leaded glass,  I should not sooner draw unto myself  Thy outward image, than I now imprint  That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts  Presented before mine, with similar act  And count'nance similar, so that from both  I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast  Incline so much, that we may thence descend  Into the other chasm, we shall escape  Secure from this imagined pursuit.\"    He had not spoke his purpose to the end,  When I from far beheld them with spread wings  Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide  Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep  Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees  The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe  And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him  Than of herself, that but a single vest  Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach  Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,  Which closes on one part the other chasm.    Never ran water with such hurrying pace  Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,  When nearest it approaches to the spokes,  As then along that edge my master ran,  Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,  Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet  Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,    When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear  In him was none; for that high Providence,  Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,  Power of departing thence took from them all.    There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,  Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,  Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.  Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down  Before their eyes, in fashion like to those  Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside  Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,  But leaden all within, and of such weight,  That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.  Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!    We yet once more with them together turn'd  To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.  But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came  The fainting people, that our company  Was chang'd at every movement of the step.    Whence I my guide address'd: \"See that thou find  Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,  And to that end look round thee as thou go'st.\"    Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,  Cried after us aloud: \"Hold in your feet,  Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.  Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.\"    Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:  \"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.\"    I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look  Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd  To overtake me; but the load they bare  And narrow path retarded their approach.    Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance  Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each  To other thus conferring said: \"This one  Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.  And, be they dead, what privilege allows  They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?\"    Then thus to me: \"Tuscan, who visitest  The college of the mourning hypocrites,  Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.\"    \"By Arno's pleasant stream,\" I thus replied,  \"In the great city I was bred and grew,  And wear the body I have ever worn.  but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,  As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?  What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?\"  \"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,\"  One of them answer'd, \"are so leaden gross,  That with their weight they make the balances  To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,  Bologna's natives, Catalano I,  He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land  Together taken, as men used to take  A single and indifferent arbiter,  To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,  Gardingo's vicinage can best declare.\"    \"O friars!\"  I began, \"your miseries--\"  But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,  Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:  He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout  Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.  And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,    Thus spake: \"That pierced spirit, whom intent  Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees  Counsel, that it were fitting for one man  To suffer for the people.  He doth lie  Transverse; nor any passes, but him first  Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.  In straits like this along the foss are plac'd  The father of his consort, and the rest  Partakers in that council, seed of ill  And sorrow to the Jews.\"  I noted then,  How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,  Thus abjectly extended on the cross  In banishment eternal.  To the friar  He next his words address'd: \"We pray ye tell,  If so be lawful, whether on our right  Lies any opening in the rock, whereby  We both may issue hence, without constraint  On the dark angels, that compell'd they come  To lead us from this depth.\"  He thus replied:  \"Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock  From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps  Each vale of horror, save that here his cope  Is shatter'd.  By the ruin ye may mount:  For on the side it slants, and most the height  Rises below.\"  With head bent down awhile  My leader stood, then spake: \"He warn'd us ill,  Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.\"    To whom the friar: At Bologna erst  \"I many vices of the devil heard,  Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,  And the father of lies!'\"  When he had spoke,  My leader with large strides proceeded on,  Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.    I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,  And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd.          CANTO XXIV    IN the year's early nonage, when the sun  Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,  And now towards equal day the nights recede,  When as the rime upon the earth puts on  Her dazzling sister's image, but not long "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#14)"],[1,"  Th' other to silence binds me: whence a sigh  I utter, and the sigh is heard.  \"Speak on;\"  The teacher cried; \"and do not fear to speak,  But tell him what so earnestly he asks.\"  Whereon I thus: \"Perchance, O ancient spirit!  Thou marvel'st at my smiling. There is room  For yet more wonder.  He who guides my ken  On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom  Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing.  If other cause thou deem'dst for which I smil'd,  Leave it as not the true one; and believe  Those words, thou spak'st of him, indeed the cause.\"    Now down he bent t' embrace my teacher's feet;  But he forbade him: \"Brother! do it not:  Thou art a shadow, and behold'st a shade.\"  He rising answer'd thus: \"Now hast thou prov'd  The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,  When I forget we are but things of air,  And as a substance treat an empty shade.\"          CANTO XXII    Now we had left the angel, who had turn'd  To the sixth circle our ascending step,  One gash from off my forehead raz'd: while they,  Whose wishes tend to justice, shouted forth:  \"Blessed!\"  and ended with, \"I thirst:\" and I,  More nimble than along the other straits,  So journey'd, that, without the sense of toil,  I follow'd upward the swift-footed shades;  When Virgil thus began: \"Let its pure flame  From virtue flow, and love can never fail  To warm another's bosom' so the light  Shine manifestly forth.  Hence from that hour,  When 'mongst us in the purlieus of the deep,  Came down the spirit of Aquinum's hard,  Who told of thine affection, my good will  Hath been for thee of quality as strong  As ever link'd itself to one not seen.  Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me.  But tell me: and if too secure I loose  The rein with a friend's license, as a friend  Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:  How chanc'd it covetous desire could find  Place in that bosom, 'midst such ample store  Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur'd there?\"    First somewhat mov'd to laughter by his words,  Statius replied: \"Each syllable of thine  Is a dear pledge of love.  Things oft appear  That minister false matters to our doubts,  When their true causes are remov'd from sight.  Thy question doth assure me, thou believ'st  I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps  Because thou found'st me in that circle plac'd.  Know then I was too wide of avarice:  And e'en for that excess, thousands of moons  Have wax'd and wan'd upon my sufferings.  And were it not that I with heedful care  Noted where thou exclaim'st as if in ire  With human nature, 'Why, thou cursed thirst  Of gold! dost not with juster measure guide  The appetite of mortals?'  I had met  The fierce encounter of the voluble rock.  Then was I ware that with too ample wing  The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn'd,  As from my other evil, so from this  In penitence.  How many from their grave  Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye  And at life's last extreme, of this offence,  Through ignorance, did not repent.  And know,  The fault which lies direct from any sin  In level opposition, here With that  Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.  Therefore if I have been with those, who wail  Their avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse  Of their transgression, such hath been my lot.\"    To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:  \"While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag'd  By the twin sorrow of Jocasta's womb,  From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems  As faith had not been shine: without the which  Good deeds suffice not.  And if so, what sun  Rose on thee, or what candle pierc'd the dark  That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,  And follow, where the fisherman had led?\"    He answering thus: \"By thee conducted first,  I enter'd the Parnassian grots, and quaff'd  Of the clear spring; illumin'd first by thee  Open'd mine eyes to God.  Thou didst, as one,  Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a light  Behind, that profits not himself, but makes  His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, 'Lo!  A renovated world!  Justice return'd!  Times of primeval innocence restor'd!  And a new race descended from above!'  Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.  That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,  My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines  With livelier colouring.  Soon o'er all the world,  By messengers from heav'n, the true belief  Teem'd now prolific, and that word of thine  Accordant, to the new instructors chim'd.  Induc'd by which agreement, I was wont  Resort to them; and soon their sanctity  So won upon me, that, Domitian's rage  Pursuing them, I mix'd my tears with theirs,  And, while on earth I stay'd, still succour'd them;  And their most righteous customs made me scorn  All sects besides.  Before I led the Greeks  In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,  I was baptiz'd; but secretly, through fear,  Remain'd a Christian, and conform'd long time  To Pagan rites.  Five centuries and more,  T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace  Round the fourth circle.  Thou then, who hast rais'd  The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,  Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,  Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,  Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn'd  They dwell, and in what province of the deep.\"  \"These,\" said my guide, \"with Persius and myself,  And others many more, are with that Greek,  Of mortals, the most cherish'd by the Nine,  In the first ward of darkness.  There ofttimes  We of that mount hold converse, on whose top  For aye our nurses live.  We have the bard  Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,  Simonides, and many a Grecian else  Ingarlanded with laurel.  Of thy train  Antigone is there, Deiphile,  Argia, and as sorrowful as erst  Ismene, and who show'd Langia's wave:  Deidamia with her sisters there,  And blind Tiresias' daughter, and the bride  Sea-born of Peleus.\"  Either poet now  Was silent, and no longer by th' ascent  Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast  Inquiring eyes.  Four handmaids of the day  Had finish'd now their office, and the fifth  Was at the chariot-beam, directing still  Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:  \"Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink  Bend the right shoulder' circuiting the mount,  As we have ever us'd.\"  So custom there  Was usher to the road, the which we chose  Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied.    They on before me went; I sole pursued,  List'ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey'd  Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.  But soon they ceas'd; for midway of the road  A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,  And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir  Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,  So downward this less ample spread, that none.  Methinks, aloft may climb.  Upon the side,  That clos'd our path, a liquid crystal fell  From the steep rock, and through the sprays above  Stream'd showering.  With associate step the bards  Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves  A voice was heard: \"Ye shall be chary of me;\"  And after added: \"Mary took more thought  For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,  Than for herself who answers now for you.  The women of old Rome were satisfied  With water for their beverage.  Daniel fed  On pulse, and wisdom gain'd.  The primal age  Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then  Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet  Run nectar.  Honey and locusts were the food,  Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness  Fed, and that eminence of glory reach'd  And greatness, which the' Evangelist records.\"          CANTO XXIII    On the green leaf mine eyes were fix'd, like his  Who throws away his days in idle chase  Of the diminutive, when thus I heard  The more than father warn me: \"Son! our time  Asks thriftier using.  Linger not: away.\"    Thereat my face and steps at once I turn'd  Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer'd  I journey'd on, and felt no toil: and lo!  A sound of weeping and a song: \"My lips,  O Lord!\" and these so mingled, it gave birth  To pleasure and to pain.  \"O Sire, belov'd!  Say what is this I hear?\"  Thus I inquir'd.    \"Spirits,\" said he, \"who as they go, perchance,  Their debt of duty pay.\"  As on their road  The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some  Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,  But stay not; thus, approaching from behind  With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass'd,  A crowd of spirits, silent and devout.  The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale  Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones  Stood staring thro' the skin.  I do not think  Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show'd,  When pinc'ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.    \"Lo!\" to myself I mus'd, \"the race, who lost  Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak  Prey'd on her child.\"  The sockets seem'd as rings,  From which the gems were drops.  Who reads the name  Of man upon his forehead, there the M  Had trac'd most plainly.  Who would deem, that scent  Of water and an apple, could have prov'd  Powerful to generate such pining want,  Not knowing how it wrought?  While now I stood  Wond'ring what thus could waste them (for the cause  Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind  Appear'd not) lo! a spirit turn'd his eyes  In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten'd then  On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:  \"What grace is this vouchsaf'd me?\"  By his looks  I ne'er had recogniz'd him: but the voice  Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal'd.  Remembrance of his alter'd lineaments  Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz'd  The visage of Forese.  \"Ah! respect  This wan and leprous wither'd skin,\" thus he  Suppliant implor'd, \"this macerated flesh.  Speak to me truly of thyself.  And who  Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?  Be it not said thou Scorn'st to talk with me.\"    \"That face of thine,\" I answer'd him, \"which dead  I once bewail'd, disposes me not less  For weeping, when I see It thus transform'd.  Say then, by Heav'n, what blasts ye thus?  The whilst  I wonder, ask not Speech from me:"]]]
