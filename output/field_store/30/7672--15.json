A year after this Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was the  well in which there was the trout.    \"Troutie, bonny little fellow,\" said she, \"am not I the most beautiful  queen in the world?\"    \"Oh! indeed you are not.\"    \"Who then?\"    \"Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.\"    \"Oh! well, it is long since she was living. It is a year since I ate  her heart and liver.\"    \"Oh! indeed she is not dead. She is married to a great prince abroad.\"    Silver-tree went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in  order, and said, \"I am going to see my dear Gold-tree, for it is so  long since I saw her.\" The long-ship was put in order, and they went  away.    It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she steered the  ship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived.    The prince was out hunting on the hills. Gold-tree knew the long-ship  of her father coming.    \"Oh!\" said she to the servants, \"my mother is coming, and she will kill  me.\"    \"She shall not kill you at all; we will lock you in a room where she  cannot get near you.\"    This is how it was done; and when Silver-tree came ashore, she began to  cry out:    \"Come to meet your own mother, when she comes to see you,\" Gold-tree  said that she could not, that she was locked in the room, and that she  could not get out of it.    \"Will you not put out,\" said Silver-tree, \"your little finger through  the key-hole, so that your own mother may give a kiss to it?\"    She put out her little finger, and Silver-tree went and put a poisoned  stab in it, and Gold-tree fell dead.    When the prince came home, and found Gold-tree dead, he was in great  sorrow, and when he saw how beautiful she was, he did not bury her at  all, but he locked her in a room where nobody would get near her.    In the course of time he married again, and the whole house was under  the hand of this wife but one room, and he himself always kept the key  of that room. On a certain day of the days he forgot to take the key  with him, and the second wife got into the room. What did she see there  but the most beautiful woman that she ever saw.    She began to turn and try to wake her, and she noticed the poisoned  stab in her finger. She took the stab out, and Gold-tree rose alive, as  beautiful as she was ever.    At the fall of night the prince came home from the hunting-hill,  looking very downcast.    \"What gift,\" said his wife, \"would you give me that I could make you  laugh?\"    \"Oh! indeed, nothing could make me laugh, except Gold-tree were to come  alive again.\"    \"Well, you'll find her alive down there in the room.\"    When the prince saw Gold-tree alive he made great rejoicings, and he  began to kiss her, and kiss her, and kiss her. Said the second wife,  \"Since she is the first one you had it is better for you to stick to  her, and I will go away.\"    \"Oh! indeed you shall not go away, but I shall have both of you.\"    At the end of the year, Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was  the well, in which there was the trout.    \"Troutie, bonny little fellow,\" said she, \"am not I the most beautiful  queen in the world?\"    \"Oh! indeed you are not.\"    \"Who then?\"    \"Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.\"    \"Oh! well, she is not alive. It is a year since I put the poisoned stab  into her finger.\"    \"Oh! indeed she is not dead at all, at all.\"    Silver-tree, went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in  order, for that she was going to see her dear Gold-tree, as it was so  long since she saw her. The long-ship was put in order, and they went  away. It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she steered  the ship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived.    The prince was out hunting on the hills. Gold-tree knew her father's  ship coming.    \"Oh!\" said she, \"my mother is coming, and she will kill me.\"    \"Not at all,\" said the second wife; \"we will go down to meet her.\"    Silver-tree came ashore. \"Come down, Gold-tree, love,\" said she, \"for  your own mother has come to you with a precious drink.\"    \"It is a custom in this country,\" said the second wife, \"that the  person who offers a drink takes a draught out of it first.\"    Silver-tree put her mouth to it, and the second wife went and struck it  so that some of it went down her throat, and she fell dead. They had  only to carry her home a dead corpse and bury her.    The prince and his two wives were long alive after this, pleased and  peaceful.    I left them there.          KING O'TOOLE AND HIS GOOSE    Och, I thought all the world, far and near, had heerd o' King  O'Toole--well, well, but the darkness of mankind is untellible! Well,  sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it afore, that there was a king,  called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in the old ancient times,  long ago; and it was he that owned the churches in the early days. The  king, you see, was the right sort; he was the real boy, and loved sport  as he loved his life, and hunting in particular; and from the rising o'  the sun, up he got, and away he went over the mountains after the deer;  and fine times they were.    Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health; but,  you see, in course of time the king grew old, by raison he was stiff in  his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him, and  he was lost entirely for want o' diversion, because he couldn't go  a-hunting no longer; and, by dad, the poor king was obliged at last to  get a goose to divert him. Oh, you may laugh, if you like, but it's  truth I'm telling you; and the way the goose diverted him was  this-a-way: You see, the goose used to swim across the lake, and go  diving for trout, and catch fish on a Friday for the king, and flew  every other day round about the lake, diverting the poor king. All went  on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years like her  master, and couldn't divert him no longer, and then it was that the  poor king was lost entirely. The king was walkin' one mornin' by the  edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, and thinking of drowning  himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of a sudden,  turning round the corner, who should he meet but a mighty decent young  man coming up to him.    \"God save you,\" says the king to the young man.    \"God save you kindly, King O'Toole,\" says the young man.    \"True for you,\" says the king. \"I am King O'Toole,\" says he, \"prince  and plennypennytinchery of these parts,\" says he; \"but how came ye to  know that?\" says he.    \"Oh, never mind,\" says St. Kavin.    You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough--the saint himself in disguise,  and nobody else. \"Oh, never mind,\" says he, \"I know more than that. May  I make bold to ask how is your goose, King O'Toole?\" says he.    \"Blur-an-agers, how came ye to know about my goose?\" says the king.    \"Oh, no matter; I was given to understand it,\" says Saint Kavin.    After some more talk the king says, \"What are you?\"    \"I'm an honest man,\" says Saint Kavin.    \"Well, honest man,\" says the king, \"and how is it you make your money  so aisy?\"    \"By makin' old things as good as new,\" says Saint Kavin.    \"Is it a tinker you are?\" says the king.    \"No,\" says the saint; \"I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole; I've a  better trade than a tinker,\" says he--\"what would you say,\" says he,  \"if I made your old goose as good as new?\"    My dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you'd think  the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head. With that  the king whistled, and down came the poor goose, just like a hound,  waddling up to the poor cripple, her master, and as like him as two  peas. The minute the saint clapt his eyes on the goose, \"I'll do the  job for you,\" says he, \"King O'Toole.\"    \"By _Jaminee_!\" says King O'Toole, \"if you do, I'll say you're the  cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.\"    \"Oh, by dad,\" says St. Kavin, \"you must say more nor that--my horn's  not so soft all out,\" says he, \"as to repair your old goose for  nothing; what'll you gi' me if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,\"  says St. Kavin.    \"I'll give you whatever you ask,\" says the king; \"isn't that fair?\"    \"Divil a fairer,\" says the saint; \"that's the way to do business. Now,\"  says he, \"this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will  you gi' me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after  I make her as good as new?\"    \"I will,\" says the king.    \"You won't go back o' your word?\" says St. Kavin.    \"Honour bright!\" says King O'Toole, holding out his fist.    \"Honour bright!\" says St. Kavin, back agin, \"it's a bargain. Come  here!\" says he to the poor old goose--\"come here, you unfortunate ould  cripple, and it's I that'll make you the sporting bird.\" With that, my  dear, he took up the goose by the two wings--\"Criss o' my cross an  you,\" says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at the same  minute--and throwing her up in the air, \"whew,\" says he, jist givin'  her a blast to help her; and with that, my jewel, she took to her  heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cutting as many  capers as a swallow before a shower of rain.    Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the king standing with  his mouth open, looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a  lark, and better than ever she was: and when she lit at his feet,  patted her on the head, and \"_Ma vourneen_,\" says he, \"but you are the  _darlint_ o' the world.\"    \"And what do you say to me,\" says 'Saint Kavin, \"for making her the  like?\"    \"By Jabers,\" says the king, \"I say nothing beats the art o' man,  barring the bees.\"    \"And do you say no more nor that?\" says Saint Kavin.    \"And that I'm beholden to you,\" says the king.    \"But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?\" says Saint  Kavin.    \"I will,\" says King O'Toole, \"and you're welcome to it,\" says he,  \"though it's the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#14)"],[1,"the essential thing. What I had to do was to  demolish at one blow a truth which had been twenty-seven years in existence  and which was all the more firmly established because it was founded on  actual facts. That was why I went for it with all my might and attacked it  by sheer force of eloquence. Impossible to identify the children? I deny  it. Inevitable confusion? It's not true. 'You're all three,' I say, 'the  victims of something which I don't know but which it is your duty to clear  up!' 'That's easily done,' says Jean Louis, whose conviction is at once  shaken. 'Let's send for Mlle. Boussignol.' 'Right! Let's send for her.'  Whereupon Mlle. Boussignol arrives and mumbles out the little speech which  I have taught her. Sensation! General stupefaction ... of which I take  advantage to carry off our young man!\"    Hortense shook her head:    \"But they'll get over it, all three of them, on thinking!\"    \"Never! Never! They will have their doubts, perhaps. But they will  never consent to feel certain! They will never agree to think! Use your  imagination! Here are three people whom I have rescued from the hell in  which they have been floundering for a quarter of a century. Do you think  they're going back to it? Here are three people who, from weakness or a  false sense of duty, had not the courage to escape. Do you think that they  won't cling like grim death to the liberty which I'm giving them? Nonsense!  Why, they would have swallowed a hoax twice as difficult to digest as that  which Mlle. Boussignol dished up for them! After all, my version was no  more absurd than the truth. On the contrary. And they swallowed it whole!  Look at this: before we left, I heard Madame d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois  speak of an immediate removal. They were already becoming quite  affectionate at the thought of seeing the last of each other.\"    \"But what about Jean Louis?\"    \"Jean Louis? Why, he was fed up with his two mothers! By Jingo, one can't  do with two mothers in a life-time! What a situation! And when one has the  luck to be able to choose between having two mothers or none at all, why,  bless me, one doesn't hesitate! And, besides, Jean Louis is in love with  Genevieve.\" He laughed. \"And he loves her well enough, I hope and trust,  not to inflict two mothers-in-law upon her! Come, you may be easy in your  mind. Your friend's happiness is assured; and that is all you asked for.  All that matters is the object which we achieve and not the more or less  peculiar nature of the methods which we employ. And, if some adventures  are wound up and some mysteries elucidated by looking for and finding  cigarette-ends, or incendiary water-bottles and blazing hat-boxes as on our  last expedition, others call for psychology and for purely psychological  solutions. I have spoken. And I charge you to be silent.\"    \"Silent?\"    \"Yes, there's a man and woman sitting behind us who seem to be saying  something uncommonly interesting.\"    \"But they're talking in whispers.\"    \"Just so. When people talk in whispers, it's always about something shady.\"    He lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair. Hortense listened, but in  vain. As for him, he was emitting little slow puffs of smoke.    Fifteen minutes later, the train stopped and the man and woman got out.    \"Pity,\" said Renine, \"that I don't know their names or where they're going.  But I know where to find them. My dear, we have a new adventure before us.\"    Hortense protested:    \"Oh, no, please, not yet!... Give me a little rest!... And oughtn't we to  think of Genevieve?\"    He seemed greatly surprised:    \"Why, all that's over and done with! Do you mean to say you want to waste  any more time over that old story? Well, I for my part confess that I've  lost all interest in the man with the two mammas.\"    And this was said in such a comical tone and with such diverting sincerity  that Hortense was once more seized with a fit of giggling. Laughter alone  was able to relax her exasperated nerves and to distract her from so many  contradictory emotions.          IV    THE TELL-TALE FILM      \"Do look at the man who's playing the butler,\" said Serge Renine.    \"What is there peculiar about him?\" asked Hortense.    They were sitting in the balcony at a picture-palace, to which Hortense had  asked to be taken so that she might see on the screen the daughter of a  lady, now dead, who used to give her piano-lessons. Rose Andree, a lovely  girl with lissome movements and a smiling face, was that evening figuring  in a new film, _The Happy Princess_, which she lit up with her high  spirits and her warm, glowing beauty.    Renine made no direct reply, but, during a pause in the performance,  continued:    \"I sometimes console myself for an indifferent film by watching the  subordinate characters. It seems to me that those poor devils, who are made  to rehearse certain scenes ten or twenty times over, must often be thinking  of other things than their parts at the time of the final exposure. And  it's great fun noting those little moments of distraction which reveal  something of their temperament, of their instinct self. As, for instance,  in the case of that butler: look!\"    The screen now showed a luxuriously served table. The Happy Princess sat at  the head, surrounded by all her suitors. Half-a-dozen footmen moved about  the room, under the orders of the butler, a big fellow with a dull, coarse  face, a common appearance and a pair of enormous eyebrows which met across  his forehead in a single line.    \"He looks a brute,\" said Hortense, \"but what do you see in him that's  peculiar?\"    \"Just note how he gazes at the princess and tell me if he doesn't stare at  her oftener than he ought to.\"    \"I really haven't noticed anything, so far,\" said Hortense.    \"Why, of course he does!\" Serge Renine declared. \"It is quite obvious that  in actual life he entertains for Rose Andree personal feelings which are  quite out of place in a nameless servant. It is possible that, in real  life, no one has any idea of such a thing; but, on the screen, when he is  not watching himself, or when he thinks that the actors at rehearsal cannot  see him, his secret escapes him. Look....\"    The man was standing still. It was the end of dinner. The princess was  drinking a glass of champagne and he was gloating over her with his  glittering eyes half-hidden behind their heavy lids.    Twice again they surprised in his face those strange expressions to which  Renine ascribed an emotional meaning which Hortense refused to see:    \"It's just his way of looking at people,\" she said.    The first part of the film ended. There were two parts, divided by an  _entr'acte_. The notice on the programme stated that \"a year had  elapsed and that the Happy Princess was living in a pretty Norman cottage,  all hung with creepers, together with her husband, a poor musician.\"    The princess was still happy, as was evident on the screen, still as  attractive as ever and still besieged by the greatest variety of suitors.  Nobles and commoners, peasants and financiers, men of all kinds fell  swooning at her feet; and prominent among them was a sort of boorish  solitary, a shaggy, half-wild woodcutter, whom she met whenever she went  out for a walk. Armed with his axe, a formidable, crafty being, he prowled  around the cottage; and the spectators felt with a sense of dismay that a  peril was hanging over the Happy Princess' head.    \"Look at that!\" whispered Renine. \"Do you realise who the man of the woods  is?\"    \"No.\"    \"Simply the butler. The same actor is doubling the two parts.\"    In fact, notwithstanding the new figure which he cut, the butler's  movements and postures were apparent under the heavy gait and rounded  shoulders of the woodcutter, even as under the unkempt beard and long,  thick hair the once clean-shaven face was visible with the cruel expression  and the bushy line of the eyebrows.    The princess, in the background, was seen to emerge from the thatched  cottage. The man hid himself behind a clump of trees. From time to time,  the screen displayed, on an enormously enlarged scale, his fiercely rolling  eyes or his murderous hands with their huge thumbs.    \"The man frightens me,\" said Hortense. \"He is really terrifying.\"    \"Because he's acting on his own account,\" said Renine. \"You must understand  that, in the space of three or four months that appears to separate the  dates at which the two films were made, his passion has made progress; and  to him it is not the princess who is coming but Rose Andree.\"    The man crouched low. The victim approached, gaily and unsuspectingly. She  passed, heard a sound, stopped and looked about her with a smiling air  which became attentive, then uneasy, and then more and more anxious. The  woodcutter had pushed aside the branches and was coming through the copse.    They were now standing face to face. He opened his arms as though to seize  her. She tried to scream, to call out for help; but the arms closed around  her before she could offer the slightest resistance. Then he threw her over  his shoulder and began to run.    \"Are you satisfied?\" whispered Renine. \"Do you think that this fourth-rate  actor would have had all that strength and energy if it had been any other  woman than Rose Andree?\"    Meanwhile the woodcutter was crossing the skirt of a forest and plunging  through great trees and masses of rocks. After setting the princess down,  he cleared the entrance to a cave which the daylight entered by a slanting  crevice.    A succession of views displayed the husband's despair, the search and the  discovery of some small branches which had been broken by the princess  and which showed the path that had been taken. Then came the final scene,  with the terrible struggle between the man and the woman when the woman,  vanquished and exhausted, is flung to the ground, the sudden arrival of the  husband and the shot that puts an end to the brute's "]]]
