To return to Lord Methuen's force. As the Hoopstad garrison had yet to  be withdrawn, the troops now under Lord Errol started thither on the  28th of March, a simultaneous movement being made by a mobile column  from Kimberley. The object of the expedition was achieved and the  garrison removed to Warrenton by the 7th of April, but not without a  skirmish on the way with Badenhorst's commando at Steenbokpan. Lord  Methuen soon recovered, and on the 23rd of April, resuming command,  transferred his force to Mafeking in order to move early in May on  Lichtenburg.    This town, at the beginning of March, had been an object of attention  to Delarey, Smuts, Celliers, and Vermaas and their bands. The garrison  (200 Yeomanry, 300 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, and two guns)  commanded by Colonel C. G. Money, had been vigorously attacked on the  3rd, the assault beginning at 3 A.M. and continuing with unabated  vigour till midnight. The enemy, numbering some 1500, with one gun,  found that there were two sides in the game of annoyance, and that the  defenders were ready and willing to give as much as they got. Indeed  they gave considerably more, for while our casualties amounted to two  officers (Major W. Fletcher and Second-Lieutenant H. D. Hall) and  fourteen men killed, and twenty-six wounded, the Boers left behind  them sixty killed and wounded and seven prisoners.    General Babington now marched to the rescue from the north-west of  Krugersdorp _via_ Ventersdorp. Here Colonel Shekleton was to have met  him with supplies, but owing to the terrific weather, and the  difficulty of moving wheeled transport in an incessant deluge, the  arrangements of both forces were delayed and considerable  inconvenience caused, and General Babington was unable to reach  Lichtenburg till the 17th. By this time the bands of Delarey had, of  course, made good their escape. But they were hunted to  Hartebeestefontein and deprived of many waggons and teams, while  sixty-two prisoners were netted, and eight killed.    Delarey, with 500 men and three guns, on the 22nd attacked a strong  patrol of the 1st Imperial Light Horse under Major Briggs at Geduld.  The Boers made a sudden swoop on the party and endeavoured to cut them  in two, but this gallant 200, with a solitary \"pom-pom,\" fought  doggedly for two and a half hours till reinforcements could arrive,  when they defeated the Dutchmen absolutely, killing eleven and  wounding thirteen. Unfortunately two gallant officers were lost.  Commandant Venter was among the Boer slain, and Field-Cornet Wolmarans  among the wounded. The report of an eye-witness was as follows:--    \"The Imperial Light Horse made another fine performance some time ago,  on two successive days, when they knocked the stuffing out of Delarey  near Klerksdorp. Delarey tackled a hundred and sixty men of the 1st  Light Horse and a \"pom-pom\" with eight hundred men. Our fellows had a  warm time of it, but being well handled by Major Briggs beat off the  attack. The following day, reinforcements having come up, they pushed  forward, and after a stiff engagement utterly routed Delarey, taking  ten guns and his convoy, besides killing and wounding a hundred and  sixty-seven Boers and taking a lot of prisoners. This was done almost  entirely by Volunteers and the Suffolks. The Boers in the first fight  charged right through the Imperial Light Horse, whose ammunition was  exhausted, but were driven back by the fire of about twenty-five men  who were holding the horses.\"    General Babington on the 22nd commenced the task of sweeping the enemy  to the north, while Colonel Shekleton operated against Delarey's right  flank. With mounted troops and guns only the commander dashed after  the Boers and overtook their rearguard, which was driven in near  Ventersdorp. Again Colonel Grey's New Zealanders and Bushmen  distinguished themselves, for on the 25th, while the enemy attempted  to take up another position to cover the withdrawal of their convoy,  the dashing Colonials, under Major O'Brien, closed in from both flanks  and fairly \"mopped it up.\" The result of the exciting march was the  capture of 140 prisoners, two 15-pounder guns, one pom-pom, six  Maxims, 160 rifles, 320 rounds 15-pounder ammunition, 15,000 rifle  ammunition, 53 waggons, and 24 carts. Twenty-two dead and 32 wounded  Boers were left on the field, while General Babington's loss was only  two killed and seven wounded. These summary actions, in which the  officers and men of the Imperial Light Horse, the 4th New Zealand  Regiment, and the 6th Imperial Bushmen played so prominent a part,  were most disconcerting to the foe, who now, owing to want of horses,  guns, and supplies, had their wings clipped, and were unable to evade  the pursuing columns. Much of the success of the proceedings was due  to the excellent service rendered by Colonel Grey, Major Gossett  (Cheshire Regiment), Major Burrows (38th Battery R.F.A.), Major  O'Brien (6th Imperial Bushmen), Lieutenant Kinton (Royal Welsh  Fusiliers), Captains Walker and Arthur (4th New Zealand Regiment),  Lieutenants Thomas and Doyle (6th Imperial Bushmen), Captains Norman,  Brierley, and Donaldson, and Lieutenants Dryden and Holbrig (Imperial  Light Horse), Captains Stanton, R.A., and Logan, and Major Cookson  (I.S.C.).    From the 2nd to the 6th of April there were more Boer-hunts towards  Tafelkop, and many small collisions with Smuts' marauders at Rietpan  and elsewhere. General Babington now returned to Ventersdorp, and from  thence made for Smuts' main laager at Goedvooruitzicht. Marching by  night across the swampy country and over the hills, Colonel Rawlinson,  with the men of Roberts' and Kitchener's Horse, prepared a little  surprise for the slumbering Dutchmen. At daybreak on the 14th April  the laager was rushed by the dashing British band, while the enemy in  consternation took to their heels. Five or six hundred fled, leaving  six killed, ten wounded, twenty-three prisoners, one 12-pounder gun,  one pom-pom, two ammunition waggons, eighteen rounds 12-pounder  ammunition, 500 rounds of pom-pom ammunition, 12,000 rounds of rifle  ammunition, twelve waggons and carts, and a large number of cattle.  Only three of the British party were wounded.    Operations still continued against Delarey, who had concentrated his  commando (numbering 2000) in the hilly country around Hartebeestefontein,  and from thence proceeded hungrily to pounce on a convoy passing from  General Babington's camp at Syferkuil to Klerksdorp. But the escort,  admirably handled, succeeded in frustrating the designs of the enemy,  whose exploit cost them twelve killed and six wounded.    [Illustration: COLONEL BENSON    (Photo by Russell & Sons, London)]    Lord Methuen, who had resumed command of his force, now marched from  Mafeking to Lichtenberg to co-operate in the movement for surrounding  the aggressive commandos that were now rendered abnormally adventurous  by famine and ferocity. General Dixon moved from the Krugersdorp  district to arrest the rush of them to north-east, while Colonel E.  Williams, with a fresh column of mounted Australians, stood in  readiness at Klerksdorp to reinforce General Babington. On the 4th of  May Generals Methuen and Babington tackled the desperadoes between  Kaffir's Kraal and Brakpan, and after a brisk engagement one  12-pounder gun, seven prisoners, and five waggons were captured. The  enemy were hunted, till, after their usual custom, they dispersed in  ones and twos into the shadow of the hills.    [Illustration: CHARGE OF THE BUSHMEN AND NEW ZEALANDERS ON THE BOER  GUNS DURING THE ATTACK ON BABINGTON'S CONVOY NEAR KLERKSDORP, MARCH  24, 1901    Drawing by R. Caton Woodville]    An account of the interesting operations was given by a trooper of the  10th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry, which regiment had been over a year  on service with Lord Methuen, and was now thinking of home:--    \"Lord Methuen's advance troops left Mafeking at daybreak on May 1, and  the whole column entered Lichtenberg on the 3rd, bringing along with  it a huge convoy of supplies. Lichtenberg was not looking so  picturesque as it did four months ago. The recent stormy times there,  and in the immediate vicinity, had necessitated the removal of a great  many trees; moreover, extra trenches had been dug and other strong  barricades built. Winter is now upon us, and the parched and worn  herbage as well as the changing tints in the foliage seemed to  harmonise, so to speak, with the melancholy surroundings. However, the  cheery strains of music which greeted us as we entered the town and  rode along a little avenue of weeping willows made us forget our  troubles for awhile. It was the fine band of the Northumberland  Fusiliers playing in a desolate orchard.    \"At 3 A.M. the following morning two squadrons of Yeomanry marched out  as mounted escort to the convoy. The column followed in its wake an  hour or so later. It was about an hour after daylight when four men of  the 37th, who were riding in advance, had the good fortune to capture  two prominent Boers--Messrs. Lemmer and Viljoen. One of them was  riding a 'jibber,' and in order to get the animal along had tied it to  that of his comrade. Consequently, when the gentlemen were taken by  surprise, their capture was easy. We saw several Boers scampering away  from some farmhouses just before we bivouacked, but, happily, they did  not molest our outposts during the day. Next morning the general had  his fighting column well on the march quite an hour before daybreak.  The convoy left half-an-hour earlier. Smoking was strictly prohibited  as long as it was dark. As soon as it grew light the 37th Squadron  were sent out in advance. Half-an-hour later"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#14)"],[1,"t, in defiance of  the most urgent three-line whips; and at dawn on the twelfth he must  be at work on his moors, shooting down the young birds with might  and main, at the earliest possible legal moment.    He goes on like Saul, slaying his thousands, or, like David, his  tens of thousands, with all the guns in the house to help him, till  the keepers warn him he has killed as many grouse as they consider  desirable; and then, having done his duty, as he thinks, in this  respect, he retires precipitately with flying colours to Brighton,  Nice, Monte Carlo, or elsewhere. He must be always \"on the trek\";  when he is buried, I believe he will not be able to rest quiet in  his grave: his ghost will walk the world to terrify old ladies.    \"At Seldon, at least,\" he said to me, with a sigh, as he stepped  into his Pullman, \"I shall be safe from that impostor!\"    And indeed, as soon as he had begun to tire a little of counting  up his hundreds of brace per diem, he found a trifling piece of  financial work cut ready to his hand, which amply distracted his  mind for the moment from Colonel Clay, his accomplices, and his  villainies.    Sir Charles, I ought to say, had secured during that summer a very  advantageous option in a part of Africa on the Transvaal frontier,  rumoured to be auriferous. Now, whether it was auriferous or not  before, the mere fact that Charles had secured some claim on it  naturally made it so; for no man had ever the genuine Midas-touch  to a greater degree than Charles Vandrift: whatever he handles turns  at once to gold, if not to diamonds. Therefore, as soon as my  brother-in-law had obtained this option from the native vendor (a  most respected chief, by name Montsioa), and promoted a company  of his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord  Craig-Ellachie (formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately  secured a similar option of an adjacent track, the larger part of  which had pretty much the same geological conditions as that covered  by Sir Charles's right of pre-emption.    We were not wholly disappointed, as it turned out, in the result.  A month or two later, while we were still at Seldon, we received  a long and encouraging letter from our prospectors on the spot,  who had been hunting over the ground in search of gold-reefs. They  reported that they had found a good auriferous vein in a corner of  the tract, approachable by adit-levels; but, unfortunately, only a  few yards of the lode lay within the limits of Sir Charles's area.  The remainder ran on at once into what was locally known as  Craig-Ellachie's section.    However, our prospectors had been canny, they said; though young  Mr. Granton was prospecting at the same time, in the self-same  ridge, not very far from them, his miners had failed to discover  the auriferous quartz; so our men had held their tongues about it,  wisely leaving it for Charles to govern himself accordingly.    \"Can you dispute the boundary?\" I asked.    \"Impossible,\" Charles answered. \"You see, the limit is a meridian  of longitude. There's no getting over that. Can't pretend to deny  it. No buying over the sun! No bribing the instruments! Besides,  we drew the line ourselves. We've only one way out of it, Sey.  Amalgamate! Amalgamate!\"    Charles is a marvellous man! The very voice in which he murmured  that blessed word \"Amalgamate!\" was in itself a poem.    \"Capital!\" I answered. \"Say nothing about it, and join forces with  Craig-Ellachie.\"    Charles closed one eye pensively.    That very same evening came a telegram in cipher from our chief  engineer on the territory of the option: \"Young Granton has somehow  given us the slip and gone home. We suspect he knows all. But we  have not divulged the secret to anybody.\"    \"Seymour,\" my brother-in-law said impressively, \"there is no time to  be lost. I must write this evening to Sir David--I mean to My Lord.  Do you happen to know where he is stopping at present?\"    \"The Morning Post announced two or three days ago that he was at  Glen-Ellachie,\" I answered.    \"Then I'll ask him to come over and thrash the matter out with me,\"  my brother-in-law went on. \"A very rich reef, they say. I must have  my finger in it!\"    We adjourned into the study, where Sir Charles drafted, I must  admit, a most judicious letter to the rival capitalist. He pointed  out that the mineral resources of the country were probably great,  but as yet uncertain. That the expense of crushing and milling might  be almost prohibitive. That access to fuel was costly, and its  conveyance difficult. That water was scarce, and commanded by our  section. That two rival companies, if they happened to hit upon ore,  might cut one another's throats by erecting two sets of furnaces or  pumping plants, and bringing two separate streams to the spot,  where one would answer. In short--to employ the golden word--that  amalgamation might prove better in the end than competition; and  that he advised, at least, a conference on the subject.    I wrote it out fair for him, and Sir Charles, with the air of a  Cromwell, signed it.    \"This is important, Sey,\" he said. \"It had better be registered,  for fear of falling into improper hands. Don't give it to Dobson;  let Cesarine take it over to Fowlis in the dog-cart.\"    It is the drawback of Seldon that we are twelve miles from a  railway station, though we look out on one of the loveliest firths  in Scotland.    Cesarine took it as directed--an invaluable servant, that girl!  Meanwhile, we learned from the Morning Post next day that young  Mr. Granton had stolen a march upon us. He had arrived from Africa  by the same mail with our agent's letter, and had joined his father  at once at Glen-Ellachie.    Two days later we received a most polite reply from the opposing  interest. It ran after this fashion:--      \"CRAIG-ELLACHIE LODGE,    \"GLEN-ELLACHIE, INVERNESS-SHIRE.    \"DEAR SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Thanks for yours of the 20th. In reply,  I can only say I fully reciprocate your amiable desire that nothing  adverse to either of our companies should happen in South Africa.  With regard to your suggestion that we should meet in person, to  discuss the basis of a possible amalgamation, I can only say my  house is at present full of guests--as is doubtless your own--and  I should therefore find it practically impossible to leave  Glen-Ellachie. Fortunately, however, my son David is now at home  on a brief holiday from Kimberley; and it will give him great  pleasure to come over and hear what you have to say in favour of an  arrangement which certainly, on some grounds, seems to me desirable  in the interests of both our concessions alike. He will arrive  to-morrow afternoon at Seldon, and he is authorised, in every  respect, to negotiate with full powers on behalf of myself and the  other directors. With kindest regards to your wife and sons, I  remain, dear Sir Charles, yours faithfully,    \"CRAIG-ELLACHIE.\"      \"Cunning old fox!\" Sir Charles exclaimed, with a sniff. \"What's he  up to now, I wonder? Seems almost as anxious to amalgamate as we  ourselves are, Sey.\" A sudden thought struck him. \"Do you know,\"  he cried, looking up, \"I really believe the same thing must have  happened to _both_ our exploring parties. _They_ must have found a  reef that goes under _our_ ground, and the wicked old rascal wants  to cheat us out of it!\"    \"As we want to cheat him,\" I ventured to interpose.    Charles looked at me fixedly. \"Well, if so, we're both in luck,\"  he murmured, after a pause; \"though _we_ can only get to know the  whereabouts of _their_ find by joining hands with them and showing  them ours. Still, it's good business either way. But I shall be  cautious--cautious.\"    \"What a nuisance!\" Amelia cried, when we told her of the incident.  \"I suppose I shall have to put the man up for the night--a nasty,  raw-boned, half-baked Scotchman, you may be certain.\"    On Wednesday afternoon, about three, young Granton arrived. He was  a pleasant-featured, red-haired, sandy-whiskered youth, not unlike  his father; but, strange to say, he dropped in to call, instead of  bringing his luggage.    \"Why, you're not going back to Glen-Ellachie to-night, surely?\"  Charles exclaimed, in amazement. \"Lady Vandrift will be _so_  disappointed! Besides, this business can't be arranged between  two trains, do you think, Mr. Granton?\"    Young Granton smiled. He had an agreeable smile--canny, yet open.    \"Oh no,\" he said frankly. \"I didn't mean to go back. I've put up at  the inn. I have my wife with me, you know--and, I wasn't invited.\"    Amelia was of opinion, when we told her this episode, that David  Granton wouldn't stop at Seldon because he was an Honourable.  Isabel was of opinion he wouldn't stop because he had married an  unpresentable young woman somewhere out in South Africa. Charles was  of opinion that, as representative of the hostile interest, he put  up at the inn, because it might tie his hands in some way to be the  guest of the chairman of the rival company. And _I_ was of opinion  that he had heard of the castle, and knew it well by report as the  dullest country-house to stay at in Scotland.    However that may be, young Granton insisted on remaining at the  Cromarty Arms, though he told us his wife would be delighted to  receive a call from Lady Vandrift and Mrs. Wentworth. So we all  returned with him to bring the Honourable Mrs. Granton up to tea  at the Castle.    She was a nice little thing, very shy and timid, but by no means  unpresentable, and an evident lady. She giggled at the end of every  sentence; and she was endowed with a slight squint, which somehow  seemed to point all her feeble sallies. She knew little outside  South Africa; but of that she talked prettily; and she won all  our hearts, in spite of the cast in her eye, by her unaffected  simplicity.    Next morning Charles and I had a regular debate with young Granton  about the rival options. Our talk was of"]]]
