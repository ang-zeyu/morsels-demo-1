Five days after the evening we have just described at Rhodopis' house,  an immense multitude was to be seen assembled at the harbor of Sais.    Egyptians of both sexes, and of every age and class were thronging to  the water's edge.    Soldiers and merchants, whose various ranks in society were betokened by  the length of their white garments, bordered with colored fringes,  were interspersed among the crowd of half-naked, sinewy men, whose only  clothing consisted of an apron, the costume of the lower classes. Naked  children crowded, pushed and fought to get the best places. Mothers in  short cloaks were holding their little ones up to see the sight, which  by this means they entirely lost themselves; and a troop of dogs and  cats were playing and fighting at the feet of these eager sight-seers,  who took the greatest pains not to tread on, or in any way injure the  sacred animals.       [According to various pictures on the Egyptian monuments. The     mothers are from Wilkinson III. 363. Isis and Hathor, with the     child Horus in her lap or at her breast, are found in a thousand     representations, dating both from more modern times and in the Greek     style. The latter seem to have served as a model for the earliest     pictures of the Madonna holding the infant Christ.]    The police kept order among this huge crowd with long staves, on the  metal heads of which the king's name was inscribed. Their care was  especially needed to prevent any of the people from being pushed into  the swollen Nile, an arm of which, in the season of the inundations,  washes the walls of Sais.    On the broad flight of steps which led between two rows of sphinxes down  to the landing-place of the royal boats, was a very different kind of  assembly.    The priests of the highest rank were seated there on stone benches.  Many wore long, white robes, others were clad in aprons, broad jewelled  collars, and garments of panther skins. Some had fillets adorned with  plumes that waved around brows, temples, and the stiff structures of  false curls that floated over their shoulders; others displayed the  glistening bareness of their smoothly-shaven skulls. The supreme judge  was distinguished by the possession of the longest and handsomest plume  in his head-dress, and a costly sapphire amulet, which, suspended by a  gold chain, hung on his breast.    The highest officers of the Egyptian army wore uniforms of gay colors,97  and carried short swords in their girdles. On the right side of the  steps a division of the body-guard was stationed, armed with battleaxes,  daggers, bows, and large shields; on the left, were the Greek  mercenaries, armed in Ionian fashion. Their new leader, our friend  Aristomachus, stood with a few of his own officers apart from the  Egyptians, by the colossal statues of Psamtik I., which had been erected  on the space above the steps, their faces towards the river.    In front of these statues, on a silver chair, sat Psamtik, the heir to  the throne: He wore a close-fitting garment of many colors, interwoven  with gold, and was surrounded by the most distinguished among the king's  courtiers, chamberlains, counsellors, and friends, all bearing staves  with ostrich feathers and lotus-flowers.    The multitude gave vent to their impatience by shouting, singing, and  quarrelling; but the priests and magnates on the steps preserved a  dignified and solemn silence. Each, with his steady, unmoved gaze, his  stiffly-curled false wig and beard, and his solemn, deliberate manner,  resembled the two huge statues, which, the one precisely similar to the  other, stood also motionless in their respective places, gazing calmly  into the stream.    At last silken sails, chequered with purple and blue, appeared in sight.    The crowd shouted with delight. Cries of, \"They are coming! Here they  are!\" \"Take care, or you'll tread on that kitten,\" \"Nurse, hold the  child higher that she may see something of the sight.\" \"You are pushing  me into the water, Sebak!\" \"Have a care Phoenician, the boys are  throwing burs into your long beard.\" \"Now, now, you Greek fellow, don't  fancy that all Egypt belongs to you, because Amasis allows you to live  on the shores of the sacred river!\" \"Shameless set, these Greeks, down  with them!\" shouted a priest, and the cry was at once echoed from many  mouths. \"Down with the eaters of swine's flesh and despisers of the  gods!\"       [The Egyptians, like the Jews, were forbidden to eat swine's flesh.     This prohibition is mentioned in the Ritual of the Dead, found in a     grave in Abd-el-Qurnah, and also in other places. Porphyr de     Abstin. IV. The swine was considered an especially unclean animal     pertaining to Typhon (Egyptian, Set) as the boar to Ares, and     swineherds were an especially despised race. Animals with bristles     were only sacrificed at the feasts of Osiris and Eileithyia. Herod.     I. 2. 47. It is probable that Moses borrowed his prohibition of     swine's flesh from the Egyptian laws with regard to unclean     animals.]    From words they were proceeding to deeds, but the police were not to be  trifled with, and by a vigorous use of their staves, the tumult was  soon stilled. The large, gay sails, easily to be distinguished among  the brown, white and blue ones of the smaller Nile-boats which swarmed  around them, came nearer and nearer to the expectant throng. Then at  last the crown-prince and the dignitaries arose from their seats. The  royal band of trumpeters blew a shrill and piercing blast of welcome,  and the first of the expected boats stopped at the landing-place.    It was a rather long, richly-gilded vessel, and bore a silver  sparrow-hawk as figure-head. In its midst rose a golden canopy with a  purple covering, beneath which cushions were conveniently arranged. On  each deck in the forepart of the ship sat twelve rowers, their aprons  attached by costly fastenings.       [Splendid Nile-boats were possessed, in greater or less numbers, by     all the men of high rank. Even in the tomb of Ti at Sakkara, which     dates from the time of the Pyramids, we meet with a chief overseer     of the vessels belonging to a wealthy Egyptian.]    Beneath the canopy lay six fine-looking men in glorious apparel; and  before the ship had touched the shore the youngest of these, a beautiful  fair-haired youth, sprang on to the steps.    Many an Egyptian girl's mouth uttered a lengthened \"Ah\" at this glorious  sight, and even the grave faces of some of the dignitaries brightened  into a friendly smile.    The name of this much-admired youth was Bartja.       [This Bartja is better known under the name of Smerdis, but on what     account the Greeks gave him this name is not clear. In the     cuneiform inscriptions of Bisitun or Behistun, he is called Bartja,     or, according to Spiegel, Bardiya. We have chosen, for the sake of     the easy pronunciation, the former, which is Rawlinson's simplified     reading of the name.]    He was the son of the late, and brother of the reigning king of Persia,  and had been endowed by nature with every gift that a youth of twenty  years could desire for himself.    Around his tiara was wound a blue and white turban, beneath which hung  fair, golden curls of beautiful, abundant hair; his blue eyes sparkled  with life and joy, kindness and high spirits, almost with sauciness;  his noble features, around which the down of a manly beard was already  visible, were worthy of a Grecian sculptor's chisel, and his slender  but muscular figure told of strength and activity. The splendor of his  apparel was proportioned to his personal beauty. A brilliant star of  diamonds and turquoises glittered in the front of his tiara. An upper  garment of rich white and gold brocade reaching just below the knees,  was fastened round the waist with a girdle of blue and white, the royal  colors of Persia. In this girdle gleamed a short, golden sword, its hilt  and scabbard thickly studded with opals and sky-blue turquoises. The  trousers were of the same rich material as the robe, fitting closely  at the ankle, and ending within a pair of short boots of light-blue  leather.    The long, wide sleeves of his robe displayed a pair of vigorous arms,  adorned with many costly bracelets of gold and jewels; round his slender  neck and on his broad chest lay a golden chain.    Such was the youth who first sprang on shore. He was followed by Darius,  the son of Hystaspes, a young Persian of the blood royal, similar in  person to Bartja, and scarcely less gorgeously apparelled than he. The  third to disembark was an aged man with snow-white hair, in whose  face the gentle and kind expression of childhood was united, with the  intellect of a man, and the experience of old age. His dress consisted  of a long purple robe with sleeves, and the yellow boots worn by the  Lydians;--his whole appearance produced an impression of the greatest  modesty and a total absence of pretension.       [On account of these boots, which are constantly mentioned, Croesus     was named by the oracle \"soft-footed.\"]    Yet this simple old man had been, but a few years before, the most  envied of his race and age; and even in our day at two thousand years'  interval, his name is used as a synonyme for the highest point of  worldly riches attainable by mankind. The old man to whom we are now  introduced is no other than Croesus, the dethroned king of Lydia, who  was then living at the court of Cambyses, as his friend and counsellor,  and had accompanied the young Bartja to Egypt, in the capacity of  Mentor.    Croesus was followed by Prexaspes, the king's Ambassador, Zopyrus, the  son of Megabyzus, a Persian noble, the friend of Bartja and Darius; and,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile â€” Complete (#14)"],[1," had been said to her,  repeated: \"Orion? Handsome Orion?\"    \"Aye, your sweet son, Orion!\" they all shouted, as loud as though she  were deaf. Then the usually placable girl, holding her hand over her  ear, with the other hit her tormentor such a smack on her thick lips  that it resounded, while she shrieked out loud, in shrill tones:    \"My son, did you say? My son Orion?--As if you did not know! Why, he was  my lover; yes, he himself said he was, and that was why they came and  bound me and cut my ears.--But you know it. But I do not love him--I  could, I might wish, I....\" She clenched her fists, and gnashed her  white teeth, and went on with panting breath:    \"Where is he?--You will not tell me? Wait a bit--only wait. Oh, I am  sharp enough, I know you have him here.--Where is be? Orion, Orion,  where are you?\"    She sprang away, ran through the sheds and lifted the lids of all the  color-vats, stooping low to look down into each as if she expected to  find him there, while the others roared with laughter.    Most of her companions giggled at this witless behavior; but some, who  felt it somewhat uncanny and whom the unhappy girl's bitter cry  had struck painfully, drew apart and had already organized some new  amusement, when a neat little woman appeared on the scene, clapping her  plump hands and exclaiming:    \"Enough of laughter--now, to bed, you swarm of bees. The night is  over too soon in the morning, and the looms must be rattling again by  sunrise. One this way and one that, just like mice when the cat appears.  Will you make haste, you night-birds? Come, will you make haste?\"    The girls had learnt to obey, and they hurried past the matron to their  sleeping-quarters. Perpetua, a woman scarcely past fifty, whose face  wore a pleasant expression of mingled shrewdness and kindness, stood  pricking up her ears and listening; she heard from the water-shed a  peculiar low, long-drawn Wheeuh!--a signal with which she was familiar  as that by which the prefect Thomas had been wont to call together his  scattered household from the garden of his villa on Mount Lebanon. It  was now Paula who gave the whistle to attract her nurse's attention.    Perpetua shook her head anxiously. What could have brought her beloved  child to see her at so late an hour? Something serious must have  occurred, and with characteristic presence of mind she called out, to  show that she had heard Paula's signal: \"Now, make haste. Will you be  quick? Wheeuh! girls--wheeuh! Hurry, hurry!\"    She followed the last of the slave-girls into the sleeping-room, and  when she had assured herself that they were all there but the crazy  Persian she enquired where she was. They had all seen her a few minutes  ago in the shed; so she bid them good-night and left them, letting it be  understood that she was about to seek the missing girl.          CHAPTER VII.    Paula went into her nurse's room, and Perpetua, after a short and vain  search for the crazy girl, abandoned her to her fate, not without some  small scruples of conscience.    A beautifully-polished copper lamp hung from the ceiling and the little  room exactly suited its mistress both were neat and clean, trim and  spruce, simple and yet nice. Snowy transparent curtains enclosed the  bed as a protection against the mosquitoes, a crucifix of delicate  workmanship hung above the head of the couch, and the seats were covered  with good cloth of various colors, fag-ends from the looms. Pretty straw  mats lay on the floor, and pots of plants, filling the little room with  fragrance, stood on the window-sill and in a corner of the room where a  clay statuette of the Good Shepherd looked down on a praying-desk.    The door had scarcely closed behind them when Perpetua exclaimed: \"But  child, how you frightened me! At so late an hour!\"    \"I felt I must come,\" said Paula. \"I could contain myself no longer.\"    \"What, tears?\" sighed the woman, and her own bright little eyes twinkled  through moisture. \"Poor soul, what has happened now?\"    She went up to the young girl to stroke her hair, but Paula rushed into  her arms, clung passionately round her neck, and burst into loud and  bitter weeping. The little matron let her weep for a while; then she  released herself, and wiped away her own tears and those of her tall  darling, which had fallen on her smooth grey hair. She took Paula's chin  in a firm hand and turned her face towards her own, saying tenderly but  decidedly: \"There, that is enough. You might cry and welcome, for  it eases the heart, but that it is so late. Is it the old story:  home-sickness, annoyances, and so forth, or is there anything new?\"    \"Alas, indeed!\" replied the girl. She pressed her handkerchief in  her hands as she went on with excited vehemence: \"I am in the last  extremity, I can bear it no longer, I cannot--I cannot! I am no longer  a child, and when in the evening you dread the night and in the morning  dread the day which must be so wretched, so utterly unendurable....\"    \"Then you listen to reason, my darling, and say to yourself that of two  evils it is wise to choose the lesser. You must hear me say once more  what I have so often represented to you before now: If we renounce our  city of refuge here and venture out into the wide world again, what  shall we find that will be an improvement?\"    \"Perhaps nothing but a hovel by a well under a couple of palm-trees;  that would satisfy me, if I only had you and could be free--free from  every one else!\"    \"What is this; what does this mean?\" muttered the elder woman shaking  her head. \"You were quite content only the day before yesterday.  Something must have....\"    \"Yes, must have happened and has,\" interrupted the girl almost beside  herself. \"My uncle's son.--You were there when he arrived--and  I thought, even I firmly believed that he was worthy of such a  reception.--I--I--pity me, for I... You do not know what influence that  man exercises over hearts.--And I--I believed his eyes, his words, his  songs and--yes, I must confess all--even his kisses on this hand! But it  was all false, all--a lie, a cruel sport with a weak, simple heart, or  even worse--more insulting still! In short, while he was doing all in  his power to entrap me--even the slaves in the barge observed it--he was  in the very act--I heard it from Dame Neforis, who is only too glad when  she can hurt me--in the very act of suing for the hand of that little  doll--you know her--little Katharina. She is his betrothed; and yet  the shameless wretch dares to carry on his game with me; he has the  face....\"    Again Paula sobbed aloud; but the older woman did not know how to help  in the matter and could only mutter to herself: \"Bad, bad--what, this  too!--Merciful Heaven!...\" But she presently recovered herself and said  firmly: \"This is indeed a new and terrible misfortune; but we have known  worse--much, much worse! So hold up your head, and whatever liking you  may have in your heart for the traitor, tear it out and trample on it.  Your pride will help you; and if you have only just found out what my  lord Orion is, you may thank God that things had gone no further between  you!\" Then she repeated to Paula all that she knew of Orion's misconduct  to the frenzied Mandane, and as Paula gave strong utterance to her  indignation, she went on:    \"Yes, child, he is a man to break hearts and ruin happiness, and perhaps  it was my duty to warn you against him; but as he is not a bad man in  other things--he saved the brother of Hathor the designer--you know  her--from drowning, at the risk of his own life--and as I hoped you  might be on friendly terms with him at least, on his return home, I  refrained.... And besides, old fool that I am, I fancied your proud  heart wore a breastplate of mail, and after all it is only a foolish  girl's heart like any other, and now in its twenty-first year has given  its love to a man for the first time.\"    But Paula interrupted her: \"I love the traitor no more! No, I hate him,  hate him beyond words! And the rest of them! I loathe them all!\"    \"Alas! that it should be so!\" sighed the nurse. \"Your lot is no doubt a  hard one. He--Orion--of course is out of the question; but I often ask  myself whether you might not mend matters with the others. If you had  not made it too hard for them, child, they must have loved you; they  could not have helped it; but ever since you have been in the house you  have only felt miserable and wished that they would let you go your own  way, and they--well they have done so; and now you find it ill to bear  the lot you chose for yourself. It is so indeed, child, you need not  contradict me. This once we will put the matter plainly: Who can hope  to win love that gives none, but turns away morosely from his  fellow-creatures? If each of us could make his neighbors after his own  pattern--then indeed! But life requires us to take them just as we find  them, and you, sweetheart, have never let this sink into your mind!\"    \"Well, I am what I am!\"    \"No doubt, and among the good you are the best--but which of them all  can guess that? Every one to some extent plays a part. And you! What  wonder if they never see in you anything but that you are unhappy? God  knows it is ten thousand times a pity that you should be! But who can  take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face?\"    \"I have never uttered a single word of complaint of my troubles to any  one of them!\" cried Paula, drawing herself up proudly.    \"That is just the difficulty,\" replied Perpetua. \"They took you in, and  thought it gave them a claim on your person and also on your sorrows.  Perhaps they longed to comfort you; for, believe me, child, there is  a secret pleasure in doing so. Any one who is able to show us sympathy  feels that it does him more good than it does us. I know life! Has it  never occurred to you that you are perhaps depriving your relations  in the great house of a pleasure, perhaps even"]]]
