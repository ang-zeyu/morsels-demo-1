She, seeing she was  not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her that he  did not include her in the number of the others, telling him he must add  to his satire and put her in the new part, or else look out for the  consequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her without a shred  of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame though it was  infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set  fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the seven wonders of  the world, and burned it with the sole object of making his name live in  after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or mention his name  by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his ambition should be  attained, nevertheless it became known that he was called Erostratus. And  something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great  emperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome. The emperor was anxious to see  that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient times the temple 'of  all the gods,' but now-a-days, by a better nomenclature, 'of all the  saints,' which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan  construction in Rome, and the one which best sustains the reputation of  mighty works and magnificence of its founders. It is in the form of a  half orange, of enormous dimensions, and well lighted, though no light  penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window, or rather round  skylight, at the top; and it was from this that the emperor examined the  building. A Roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the  skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful  architecture, and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor,  'A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize  your Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as  to leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever.' 'I am  thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,' said  the emperor, 'and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again  putting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to  speak to me or to be where I am; and he followed up these words by  bestowing a liberal bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the  desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest thou,  was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the  depths of the Tiber? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius? What  impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened in the  midst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens that declared against  him, made Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern  examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and cut off the  gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous Cortes in the  New World? All these and a variety of other great exploits are, were and  will be, the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion  of the immortality their famous deeds deserve; though we Catholic  Christians and knights-errant look more to that future glory that is  everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to the vanity of the  fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life; a fame that,  however long it may last, must after all end with the world itself, which  has its own appointed end. So that, O Sancho, in what we do we must not  overpass the bounds which the Christian religion we profess has assigned  to us. We have to slay pride in giants, envy by generosity and nobleness  of heart, anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and  sloth by the spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils, lust and  lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the  mistresses of our thoughts, indolence by traversing the world in all  directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians,  famous knights. Such, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those  extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.\"    \"All that your worship has said so far,\" said Sancho, \"I have understood  quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would dissolve a  doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.\"    \"Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"say on, in God's name,  and I will answer as well as I can.\"    \"Tell me, senor,\" Sancho went on to say, \"those Julys or Augusts, and all  those venturous knights that you say are now dead--where are they now?\"    \"The heathens,\" replied Don Quixote, \"are, no doubt, in hell; the  Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or in  heaven.\"    \"Very good,\" said Sancho; \"but now I want to know--the tombs where the  bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, or  are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches, winding-sheets,  tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they ornamented with?\"    To which Don Quixote made answer: \"The tombs of the heathens were  generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Caesar's body were  placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in  Rome Saint Peter's needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as  large as a good-sized village, which they called the Moles Adriani, and  is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen Artemisia buried her  husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of  the world; but none of these tombs, or of the many others of the  heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other  offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are  saints.\"    \"That's the point I'm coming to,\" said Sancho; \"and now tell me, which is  the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?\"    \"The answer is easy,\" replied Don Quixote; \"it is a greater work to bring  to life a dead man.\"    \"Now I have got you,\" said Sancho; \"in that case the fame of them who  bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,  restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps  burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees  adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other than  that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever  been in the world have left or may leave behind them?\"    \"That I grant, too,\" said Don Quixote.    \"Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call  it,\" said Sancho, \"belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,  with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, have  lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by  means of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian  reputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their  shoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their  oratories and favourite altars with them.\"    \"What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?\" asked  Don Quixote.    \"My meaning is,\" said Sancho, \"let us set about becoming saints, and we  shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you  know, senor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so lately  one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefoot friars,  and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch the iron  chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and they are held  in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of Roland in the  armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that, senor, it is  better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order, than a  valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance lashings are  of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given to giants,  or monsters, or dragons.\"    \"All that is true,\" returned Don Quixote, \"but we cannot all be friars,  and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry is a  religion, there are sainted knights in glory.\"    \"Yes,\" said Sancho, \"but I have heard say that there are more friars in  heaven than knights-errant.\"    \"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"is because those in religious orders are more  numerous than knights.\"    \"The errants are many,\" said Sancho.    \"Many,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but few they who deserve the name of  knights.\"    With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that  night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to  them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the  next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the  sight of which Don Quixote's spirits rose and Sancho's fell, for he did  not know Dulcinea's house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any  more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her,  the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what  he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don  Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited  until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and  when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance  into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called  something.

Bergthora saw  the money, and said, \"This is very justly settled; but even as  much money shall be paid for Kol as time goes on.\"    Gunnar came home from the Thing and blamed Hallgerda.  She said,  better men lay unatoned in many places.  Gunnar said, she might  have her way in beginning a quarrel, \"but how the matter is to be  settled rests with me.\"    Hallgerda was for ever chattering of Swart's slaying, but  Bergthora liked that ill.  Once Njal and her sons went up to  Thorolfsfell to see about the house-keeping there, but that  selfsame day this thing happened when Bergthora was out of doors:  she sees a man ride up to the house on a black horse.  She stayed  there and did not go in, for she did not know the man.  That man  had a spear in his hand, and was girded with a short sword.  She  asked this man his name.    \"Atli is my name,\" says he.    She asked whence he came.    \"I am an Eastfirther,\" he says.    \"Whither shalt thou go?\" she says.    \"I am a homeless man,\" says he, \"and I thought to see Njal and  Skarphedinn, and know if they would take me in.\"    \"What work is handiest to thee?\" says she.    \"I am a man used to field-work,\" he says, \"and many things else  come very handy to me; but I will not hide from thee that I am a  man of hard temper, and it has been many a man's lot before now  to bind up wounds at my hand.\"    \"I do not blame thee,\" she says, \"though thou art no milksop.\"    Atli said, \"Hast thou any voice in things here?\"    \"I am Njal's wife,\" she says, \"and I have as much to say to our  housefolk as he.\"    \"Wilt thou take me in then?\" says he.    \"I will give thee thy choice of that,\" says she.  \"If thou wilt  do all the work that I set before thee, and that, though I wish  to send thee where a man's life is at stake.\"    \"Thou must have so many men at thy beck,\" says he, \"that thou  wilt not need me for such work.\"    \"That I will settle as I please,\" she says.    \"We will strike a bargain on these terms,\" says he.    Then she took him into the household.  Njal and his sons came  home and asked Bergthora what man that might be?    \"He is thy house-carle,\" she says, \"and I took him in.\"  Then she  went on to say he was no sluggard at work.    \"He will be a great worker enough, I daresay,\" says Njal, \"but I  do not know whether he will be such a good worker.\"    Skarphedinn was good to Atli.    Njal and his sons ride to the Thing in the course of the summer;  Gunnar was also at the Thing.    Njal took out a purse of money.    \"What money is that, father?\"    \"Here is the money that Gunnar paid me for our housecarle last  summer.\"    \"That will come to stand thee in some stead,\" says Skarphedinn,  and smiled as he spoke.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  Grieve, i.e., bailiff, head workman.        37. THE SLAYING OF KOL, WHOM ATLI SLEW    Now we must take up the story and say, that Atli asked Bergthora  what work he should do that day?    \"I have thought of some work for thee,\" she says; \"thou shalt go  and look for Kol until thou find him; for now shalt thou slay him  this very day, if thou wilt do my will.\"    \"This work is well fitted,\" says Atli, \"for each of us two are  bad fellows; but still I will so lay myself out for him that one  or other of us shall die.\"    \"Well mayst thou fare,\" she says, \"and thou shalt not do this  deed for nothing.\"    He took his weapons and his horse, and rode up to Fleetlithe, and  there met men who were coming down from Lithend.  They were at  home east in the Mark.  They asked Atli whither he meant to go?  He said he was riding to look for an old jade.  They said that  was a small errand for such a workman, \"but still 'twould be  better to ask those who have been about last night.\"    \"Who are they?\" says he.    \"Killing-Kol,\" say they, \"Hallgerda's house-carle, fared from the  fold just now, and has been awake all night.\"    \"I do not know whether I dare to meet him,\" says Atli, \"he is  bad-tempered, and may be that I shall let another's wound be my  warning.\"    \"Thou bearest that look beneath the brows as though thou wert no  coward,\" they said, and showed him where Kol was.    Then he spurred his horse and rides fast, and when he meets Kol,  Atli said to him, \"Go the pack-saddle bands well,\" says Atli.    \"That's no business of thine, worthless fellow, nor of any one  else whence thou comest.\"    Atli said, \"Thou hast something behind that is earnest work, but  that is to die.\"    After that Atli thrust at him with his spear, and struck him  about his middle.  Kol swept at him with his axe, but missed him,  and fell off his horse, and died at once.    Atli rode till he met some of Hallgerda's workmen, and said, \"Go  ye up to the horse yonder, and look to Kol, for he has fallen  off, and is dead.\"    \"Hast thou slain him?\" say they.    \"Well, 'twill seem to Hallgerda as though he has not fallen by  his own hand.\"    After that Atli rode home and told Bergthora; she thanked him for  this deed, and for the words which he had spoken about it.    \"I do not know,\" says he, \"what Njal will think of this.\"    \"He will take it well upon his hands,\" she says, \"and I will tell  thee one thing as a token of it, that he has carried away with  him to the Thing the price of that thrall which we took last  spring, and that money will now serve for Kol; but though peace  be made thou must still be ware of thyself, for Hallgerda will  keep no peace.\"    \"Wilt thou send at all a man to Njal to tell him of the slaying?\"    \"I will not,\" she says, \"I should like it better that Kol were  unatoned.\"    Then they stopped talking about it.    Hallgerda was told of Kol's slaying, and of the words that Atli  had said.  She said Atli should be paid off for them.  She sent a  man to the Thing to tell Gunnar of Kol's slaying; he answered  little or nothing, and sent a man to tell Njal.  He too made no  answer, but Skarphedinn said, \"Thralls are men of more mettle  than of yore; they used to fly at each other and fight, and no  one thought much harm of that; but now they will do naught but  kill,\" and as he said this he smiled.    Njal pulled down the purse of money which hung up in the booth,  and went out: his sons went with him to Gunnar's booth.    Skarphedinn said to a man who was in the doorway of the booth,  \"Say thou to Gunnar that my father wants to see him.\"    He did so, and Gunnar went out at once and gave Njal a hearty  welcome.  After that they began to talk.    \"'Tis ill done,\" says Njal, \"that my housewife should have broken  the peace, and let thy house-carle be slain.\"    \"She shall not have blame for that,\" says Gunnar.    \"Settle the award thyself,\" says Njal.    \"So I will do,\" says Gunnar, \"and I value those two men at an  even price, Swart and Kol.  Thou shalt pay me twelve ounces in  silver.\"    Njal took the purse of money and handed it to Gunnar.  Gunnar  knew the money, and saw it was the same that he had paid Njal.  Njal went away to his booth, and they were just as good friends  as before.  When Njal came home, he blamed Bergthora; but she  said she would never give way to Hallgerda.  Hallgerda was very  cross with Gunnar, because he had made peace for Kol's slaying.  Gunnar told her he would never break with Njal or his sons, and  she flew into a great rage; but Gunnar took no heed of that, and  so they sat for that year, and nothing noteworthy happened.        38. THE KILLING OF ATLI THE THRALL    Next spring Njal said to Atli, \"I wish that thou wouldst change  thy abode to the east firths, so that Hallgerda may not put an  end to thy life?\"    \"I am not afraid of that,\" says Atli, \"and I will willingly stay  at home if I have the choice.\"    \"Still that is less wise,\" says Njal.    \"I think it better to lose my life in thy house than to change my  master; but this I will beg of thee, if I am slain, that a  thrall's price shall not be paid for me.\"    \"Thou shalt be atoned for as a free man; but perhaps Bergthora  will make thee a promise which she will fulfil, that revenge, man  for man, shall be taken for thee.\"    Then he made up his mind to be a hired servant there.    Now it must be told of Hallgerda that she sent a man west to  Bearfirth, to fetch Brynjolf the Unruly, her kinsman.  He was a  base son of Swan, and he was one of the worst of men.  Gunnar  knew nothing about it.  Hallgerda said he was well fitted to be a  grieve.  So Brynjolf came from the west, and Gunnar asked what he  was to do there?  He said he was going to stay there.    \"Thou wilt not better our household,\" says Gunnar, \"after what  has been told me of thee, but I will not turn away any of  Hallgerda's kinsmen, whom she wishes to be with her.\"    Gunnar said little, but was not unkind to him, and so things went  on till the Thing.  Gunnar rides to the Thing and Kolskegg rides  too, and when they came to the Thing they and Njal met, for he  and his sons were at the Thing, and all went well with Gunnar and  them.    Bergthora said to Atli, \"Go thou up into Thorolfsfell and work  there a week.\"    So he went up thither, and was there on the sly, and burnt  charcoal in the wood.    Hallgerda said to Brynjolf, \"I have been told Atli is not at  home, and he must be winning work on Thorolfsfell.\"    \"What thinkest thou likeliest that he is working at,\" says he.    \"At something in the wood,\" she says.    \"What shall I do to him?\" he asks.    \"Thou shalt kill him,\" says she.    He was rather slow in answering her, and Hallgerda said, \"'Twould  grow less in Thiostolf's eyes to kill Atli if he were alive.\"    \"Thou shalt have no need to goad me on much more,\" he says, and  then he seized his weapons, and takes his horse and mounts, and  rides to Thorolfsfell.  There he saw a great reek of coalsmoke  east of the homestead, so he rides thither, and gets off his  horse and ties him up, but he goes where the smoke was thickest.  Then he sees where the charcoal pit is, and a man stands by it.  He saw that he had thrust his spear in the ground by him.  Brynjolf goes along with"]]]
