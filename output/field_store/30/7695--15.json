The mistake is not in attaching  importance to preparation for future need, but in making it the  mainspring of present effort. Because the need of preparation for a  continually developing life is great, it is imperative that every energy  should be bent to making the present experience as rich and significant  as possible. Then as the present merges insensibly into the future, the  future is taken care of.    2. Education as Unfolding. There is a conception of education which  professes to be based upon the idea of development. But it takes back  with one hand what it proffers with the other. Development is conceived  not as continuous growing, but as the unfolding of latent powers toward  a definite goal. The goal is conceived of as completion,--perfection.  Life at any stage short of attainment of this goal is merely an  unfolding toward it. Logically the doctrine is only a variant of the  preparation theory. Practically the two differ in that the adherents of  the latter make much of the practical and professional duties for which  one is preparing, while the developmental doctrine speaks of the ideal  and spiritual qualities of the principle which is unfolding.    The conception that growth and progress are just approximations to  a final unchanging goal is the last infirmity of the mind in its  transition from a static to a dynamic understanding of life. It  simulates the style of the latter. It pays the tribute of speaking  much of development, process, progress. But all of these operations  are conceived to be merely transitional; they lack meaning on their own  account. They possess significance only as movements toward something  away from what is now going on. Since growth is just a movement toward a  completed being, the final ideal is immobile. An abstract and indefinite  future is in control with all which that connotes in depreciation of  present power and opportunity.    Since the goal of perfection, the standard of development, is very far  away, it is so beyond us that, strictly speaking, it is unattainable.  Consequently, in order to be available for present guidance it must be  translated into something which stands for it. Otherwise we should  be compelled to regard any and every manifestation of the child as an  unfolding from within, and hence sacred. Unless we set up some definite  criterion representing the ideal end by which to judge whether a given  attitude or act is approximating or moving away, our sole alternative is  to withdraw all influences of the environment lest they interfere with  proper development. Since that is not practicable, a working substitute  is set up. Usually, of course, this is some idea which an adult would  like to have a child acquire. Consequently, by \"suggestive questioning\"  or some other pedagogical device, the teacher proceeds to \"draw out\"  from the pupil what is desired. If what is desired is obtained, that  is evidence that the child is unfolding properly. But as the pupil  generally has no initiative of his own in this direction, the result is  a random groping after what is wanted, and the formation of habits of  dependence upon the cues furnished by others. Just because such methods  simulate a true principle and claim to have its sanction they may do  more harm than would outright \"telling,\" where, at least, it remains  with the child how much will stick.    Within the sphere of philosophic thought there have been two typical  attempts to provide a working representative of the absolute goal. Both  start from the conception of a whole--an absolute--which is \"immanent\"  in human life. The perfect or complete ideal is not a mere ideal; it  is operative here and now. But it is present only implicitly,  \"potentially,\" or in an enfolded condition. What is termed development  is the gradual making explicit and outward of what is thus wrapped up.  Froebel and Hegel, the authors of the two philosophic schemes  referred to, have different ideas of the path by which the progressive  realization of manifestation of the complete principle is effected.  According to Hegel, it is worked out through a series of historical  institutions which embody the different factors in the Absolute.  According to Froebel, the actuating force is the presentation of  symbols, largely mathematical, corresponding to the essential traits  of the Absolute. When these are presented to the child, the Whole,  or perfection, sleeping within him, is awakened. A single example  may indicate the method. Every one familiar with the kindergarten is  acquainted with the circle in which the children gather. It is not  enough that the circle is a convenient way of grouping the children. It  must be used \"because it is a symbol of the collective life of mankind  in general.\" Froebel's recognition of the significance of the native  capacities of children, his loving attention to them, and his influence  in inducing others to study them, represent perhaps the most effective  single force in modern educational theory in effecting widespread  acknowledgment of the idea of growth. But his formulation of the notion  of development and his organization of devices for promoting it were  badly hampered by the fact that he conceived development to be the  unfolding of a ready-made latent principle. He failed to see that  growing is growth, developing is development, and consequently placed  the emphasis upon the completed product. Thus he set up a goal which  meant the arrest of growth, and a criterion which is not applicable to  immediate guidance of powers, save through translation into abstract and  symbolic formulae.    A remote goal of complete unfoldedness is, in technical philosophic  language, transcendental. That is, it is something apart from direct  experience and perception. So far as experience is concerned, it is  empty; it represents a vague sentimental aspiration rather than anything  which can be intelligently grasped and stated. This vagueness must be  compensated for by some a priori formula. Froebel made the connection  between the concrete facts of experience and the transcendental ideal of  development by regarding the former as symbols of the latter. To  regard known things as symbols, according to some arbitrary a priori  formula--and every a priori conception must be arbitrary--is an  invitation to romantic fancy to seize upon any analogies which appeal  to it and treat them as laws. After the scheme of symbolism has been  settled upon, some definite technique must be invented by which the  inner meaning of the sensible symbols used may be brought home to  children. Adults being the formulators of the symbolism are naturally  the authors and controllers of the technique. The result was that  Froebel's love of abstract symbolism often got the better of his  sympathetic insight; and there was substituted for development as  arbitrary and externally imposed a scheme of dictation as the history of  instruction has ever seen.    With Hegel the necessity of finding some working concrete counterpart of  the inaccessible Absolute took an institutional, rather than symbolic,  form. His philosophy, like Froebel's, marks in one direction an  indispensable contribution to a valid conception of the process of life.  The weaknesses of an abstract individualistic philosophy were evident  to him; he saw the impossibility of making a clean sweep of historical  institutions, of treating them as despotisms begot in artifice and  nurtured in fraud. In his philosophy of history and society culminated  the efforts of a whole series of German writers--Lessing, Herder, Kant,  Schiller, Goethe--to appreciate the nurturing influence of the great  collective institutional products of humanity. For those who learned  the lesson of this movement, it was henceforth impossible to conceive  of institutions or of culture as artificial. It destroyed completely--in  idea, not in fact--the psychology that regarded \"mind\" as a ready-made  possession of a naked individual by showing the significance of  \"objective mind\"--language, government, art, religion--in the formation  of individual minds. But since Hegel was haunted by the conception of an  absolute goal, he was obliged to arrange institutions as they concretely  exist, on a stepladder of ascending approximations. Each in its time  and place is absolutely necessary, because a stage in the self-realizing  process of the absolute mind. Taken as such a step or stage, its  existence is proof of its complete rationality, for it is an integral  element in the total, which is Reason. Against institutions as they are,  individuals have no spiritual rights; personal development, and nurture,  consist in obedient assimilation of the spirit of existing institutions.  Conformity, not transformation, is the essence of education.  Institutions change as history shows; but their change, the rise and  fall of states, is the work of the \"world-spirit.\" Individuals, save the  great \"heroes\" who are the chosen organs of the world-spirit, have  no share or lot in it. In the later nineteenth century, this type of  idealism was amalgamated with the doctrine of biological evolution.    \"Evolution\" was a force working itself out to its own end. As against  it, or as compared with it, the conscious ideas and preference of  individuals are impotent. Or, rather, they are but the means by which  it works itself out. Social progress is an \"organic growth,\" not an  experimental selection. Reason is all powerful, but only Absolute Reason  has any power.    The recognition (or rediscovery, for the idea was familiar to the  Greeks) that great historic institutions are active factors in the  intellectual nurture of mind was a great contribution to educational  philosophy. It indicated a genuine advance beyond Rousseau, who had  marred his assertion that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#14)"],[1,"watch him go by. He was dead sure  he, for one, wasn't going to make a fool of himself over any swell-headed  politician.    Still, he saddled and rode with his fellows for a mile or two, and called  them unseemly names in a facetious tone; and the men of the Wishbone  answered his taunts with shrill yells of derision when he swung out of the  trail and jogged away to the south, and finally passed out of sight in the  haze which still hung depressingly over the land.    Oddly enough, while all the able-bodied men save Kent were waiting  hilariously in Hope to greet, with enthusiasm, the brief presence of the  man who would fain be their political chief, the train which bore him  eastward scattered fiery destruction abroad as it sped across their range,  four minutes late and straining to make up the time before the next stop.    They had thought the railroad safe at last, what with the guards and the  numerous burned patches where the fire had jumped the plowed boundary and  blackened the earth to the fence which marked the line of the right of way,  and, in some places, had burned beyond. It took a flag-flying special train  of that bitter Presidential campaign to find a weak spot in the guard, and  to send a spark straight into the thickest bunch of wiry sand grass, where  the wind could fan it to a blaze and then seize it and bend the tall flame  tongues until they licked around the next tuft of grass, and the next,  and the next--until the spark was grown to a long, leaping line of fire,  sweeping eastward with the relentless rush of a tidal wave upon a low-lying  beach.    Arline Hawley was, perhaps, the only citizen of Hope who had deliberately  chosen to absent herself from the crowd standing, in perspiring  expectation, upon the depot platform. She had permitted Minnie, the \"breed\"  girl, to go, and had even grudgingly consented to her using a box of  cornstarch as first aid to her complexion. Arline had not approved,  however, of either the complexion or the occasion.    \"What you want to go and plaster your face up with starch for, gits me,\"  she had criticised frankly. \"Seems to me you're homely enough without  lookin' silly, into the bargain. Nobody's going to look at you, no matter  what you do. They're out to rubber at a higher mark than you be. And what  they expect to see so great, gits me. He ain't nothing but a man--and, land  knows, men is common enough, and ornery enough, without runnin' like a band  of sheep to see one. I don't see as he's any better, jest because he's  runnin' for President; if he gits beat, he'll want to hide his head in a  hole in the ground. Look at my Walt. _He_ was the biggest man in Hope, and  so swell-headed he wouldn't so much as pack a bucket of water all fall, or  chop up a tie for kindlin'--till the day after 'lection. And what was he  then but a frazzled-out back number, that everybody give the laugh--till he  up and blowed his brains out! Any fool can _run_ for President--it's the  feller that gits there that counts.    \"Say, that red-white-'n'-blue ribbon sure looks fierce on that green  dress--but I reckon blood will tell, even if it's Injun blood. G'wan, or  you'll be late and have your trouble for your pay. But hurry back soon's  the agony's over; the bread'll be ready to mix out.\"    Even after the girl was gone, her finery a-flutter in the sweeping west  wind, Arline muttered aloud her opinion of men, and particularly of  politicians who rode about in special trains and expected the homage of  their fellows.    She was in the back yard, taking her \"white clothes\" off the line, when the  special came puffing slowly into town. To emphasize her disapproval of the  whole system of politics, she turned her back square toward it, and laid  violent hold of a sheet. There was a smudge of cinders upon its white  surface, and it crushed crisply under her thumb with the unmistakable feel  of burned grass.    \"Now, what in time--\" began Arline aloud, after the manner of women whose  tongues must keep pace with their thoughts. \"That there feels fresh  and\"--with a sniff at the spot--\"_smells_ fresh.\"    With the wisdom of much experience she faced the hot wind and sniffed  again, while her eyes searched keenly the sky line, which was the ragged  top of the bluff marking the northern boundary of the great prairie land. A  trifle darker it was there, and there was a certain sullen glow discernible  only to eyes trained to read the sky for warning signals of snow, fire, and  flood.    \"That's a fire, and it's this side of the river. And if it is, then the  railroad set it, and there ain't a livin' thing to stop it. An' the wind's  jest right--\" A curdled roll of smoke showed plainly for a moment in the  haze. She crammed her armful of sheets into the battered willow basket,  threw two clothespins hastily toward the same receptacle, and ran.    The special had just come to a stop at the depot. The cattlemen, cowboys,  and townspeople were packed close around the rear of the train, their backs  to the wind and the disaster sweeping down upon them, their browned faces  upturned to the sleek, carefully groomed man in the light-gray suit, with a  flaunting, prairie sunflower ostentatiously displayed in his buttonhole and  with his campaign smile upon his lips and dull boredom looking out of his  eyes.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he was saying, as he smiled, \"you favoured ones  whose happy lot it is to live in the most glorious State of our glorious  union, I greet you, and I envy you--\"    Arline, with her soiled kitchen apron, her ragged coil of dust-brown hair,  her work-drawn face and faded eyes which blazed with excitement, pushed  unceremoniously through the crowd and confronted him undazzled.    \"Mister Candidate, you better move on and give these men a chancet to save  their prope'ty,\" she cried shrilly. \"They got something to do besides stand  around here and listen at you throwin' campaign loads. The hull country's  afire back of us, and the wind bringin' it down on a long lope.\"    She turned from the astounded candidate and glared at the startled crowd,  every one of whom she knew personally.    \"I must say I got my opinion of a bunch that'll stand here swallowin' a lot  of hot air, while their coat tails is most ready to ketch afire!\" Her voice  was rasping, and it carried to the farthest of them. \"You make me _tired!_  Political slush, all of it--and the hull darned country a-blazin' behind  you!\"    The crowd moved uneasily, then scattered away from the shelter of the depot  to where they could snuff inquiringly the wind, like dogs in the leash.    \"That's right,\" yelled Blumenthall, of the Double Diamond. \"There's a fire,  sure as hell!\" He started to run.    The man behind him hesitated but a second, then gripped his hat against the  push of the wind, and began running. Presently men, women, and children  were running, all in one direction.    The prospective President stood agape upon the platform of his  bunting-draped car, his chosen allies grouped foolishly around him. It  was the first time men had turned from his presence with his gracious,  flatteringly noncommittal speech unuttered, his hand unshaken, his smiling,  bowing departure unmarked by cheers growing fainter as he receded. Only  Arline tarried, her thin fingers gripping the arm of her \"breed girl,\" lest  she catch the panic and run with the others.    Arline tilted back her head upon her scrawny shoulders and eyed the  prospective President with antagonism unconcealed.    \"I got something to say to you before you go,\" she announced, in her  rasping voice, with its querulous note. \"I want to tell you that the  chances are a hundred to one you set that fire yourself, with your engine  that's haulin' you around over the country, so you can jolly men into  votin' for you. Your train's the only one over the road since noon, and  that fire started from the railroad. The hull town's liable to burn, unless  it can be stopped the other side the creek, to say nothing of the range,  that feeds our stock, and the hay, and maybe houses--and maybe _people!_\"    She caught her breath, and almost shrieked the last three words, as a  dreadful probability flashed into her mind.    \"I know a woman--just a girl--and she's back there twenty mile--_alone_,  and her man's here to look at you go by! I hope you git beat, just for  that!    \"If this town ketches afire and burns up, I hope you run into the ditch  before you git ten mile! If you was a man, and them fellers with you was  men, you'd hold up your train and help save the town. Every feller counts,  when it comes to fightin' fire.\"    She stopped and eyed the group keenly. \"But you won't. I don't reckon you  ever done anything with them hands in your life that would grind a little  honest dirt into your knuckles and under them shiny nails!\"    The prospective President turned red to his ears, and hastily removed his  immaculate hands from where they had been resting upon the railing. And he  did not hold up the train while he and his allies stopped to help save the  town. The whistle gave a warning toot, the bell jangled, and the train slid  away toward the next town, leaving Arline staring, tight-lipped, after it.    \"The darned chump--he'd 'a' made votes hand over fist if he'd called my  bluff; but, I knew he wouldn't, soon as I seen his face. He ain't man  enough.\"    \"He's real good-lookin',\" sighed Minnie, feebly attempting to release her  arm from the grasp of her mistress. \"And did you notice the fellow with the  big yellow mustache? He kept eyin' me--\"    \"Well, I don't wonder--but it ain't anything to your credit,\" snapped  Arline, facing her toward the hotel, \"You do look like sin a-flyin', in  that green dress, and with all that starch on your face. You git along to  the house and mix that bread, first thing you do, and start a fire. And if  I ain't back by that time, you go ahead with the supper; you know what to  git. We're liable to have"]]]
