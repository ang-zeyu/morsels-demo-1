We  have heard of a certain standard of decorum which demands that things  should be funny without being vulgar, but the standard of this decorum  demands that if things are vulgar they shall be vulgar without being  funny.  This journalism does not merely fail to exaggerate life--it  positively underrates it; and it has to do so because it is intended  for the faint and languid recreation of men whom the fierceness of  modern life has fatigued. This press is not the yellow press at all; it  is the drab press. Sir Alfred Harmsworth must not address to the tired  clerk any observation more witty than the tired clerk might be able to  address to Sir Alfred Harmsworth.  It must not expose anybody (anybody  who is powerful, that is), it must not offend anybody, it must not even  please anybody, too much.  A general vague idea that in spite of all  this, our yellow press is sensational, arises from such external  accidents as large type or lurid headlines. It is quite true that these  editors print everything they possibly can in large capital letters.  But they do this, not because it is startling, but because it is  soothing.  To people wholly weary or partly drunk in a dimly lighted  train, it is a simplification and a comfort to have things presented in  this vast and obvious manner. The editors use this gigantic alphabet in  dealing with their readers, for exactly the same reason that parents  and governesses use a similar gigantic alphabet in teaching children to  spell. The nursery authorities do not use an A as big as a horseshoe in  order to make the child jump; on the contrary, they use it to put the  child at his ease, to make things smoother and more evident. Of the  same character is the dim and quiet dame school which Sir Alfred  Harmsworth and Mr. Pearson keep.  All their sentiments are  spelling-book sentiments--that is to say, they are sentiments with  which the pupil is already respectfully familiar. All their wildest  posters are leaves torn from a copy-book.    Of real sensational journalism, as it exists in France, in Ireland, and  in America, we have no trace in this country. When a journalist in  Ireland wishes to create a thrill, he creates a thrill worth talking  about.  He denounces a leading Irish member for corruption, or he  charges the whole police system with a wicked and definite conspiracy.  When a French journalist desires a frisson there is a frisson; he  discovers, let us say, that the President of the Republic has murdered  three wives. Our yellow journalists invent quite as unscrupulously as  this; their moral condition is, as regards careful veracity, about the  same. But it is their mental calibre which happens to be such that they  can only invent calm and even reassuring things. The fictitious version  of the massacre of the envoys of Pekin was mendacious, but it was not  interesting, except to those who had private reasons for terror or  sorrow.  It was not connected with any bold and suggestive view of the  Chinese situation. It revealed only a vague idea that nothing could be  impressive except a great deal of blood.  Real sensationalism, of which  I happen to be very fond, may be either moral or immoral. But even when  it is most immoral, it requires moral courage. For it is one of the  most dangerous things on earth genuinely to surprise anybody.  If you  make any sentient creature jump, you render it by no means improbable  that it will jump on you. But the leaders of this movement have no  moral courage or immoral courage; their whole method consists in  saying, with large and elaborate emphasis, the things which everybody  else says casually, and without remembering what they have said.  When  they brace themselves up to attack anything, they never reach the point  of attacking anything which is large and real, and would resound with  the shock.  They do not attack the army as men do in France, or the  judges as men do in Ireland, or the democracy itself as men did in  England a hundred years ago. They attack something like the War  Office--something, that is, which everybody attacks and nobody bothers  to defend, something which is an old joke in fourth-rate comic papers.  just as a man shows he has a weak voice by straining it to shout, so  they show the hopelessly unsensational nature of their minds when they  really try to be sensational. With the whole world full of big and  dubious institutions, with the whole wickedness of civilization staring  them in the face, their idea of being bold and bright is to attack the  War Office. They might as well start a campaign against the weather, or  form a secret society in order to make jokes about mothers-in-law. Nor  is it only from the point of view of particular amateurs of the  sensational such as myself, that it is permissible to say, in the words  of Cowper's Alexander Selkirk, that \"their tameness is shocking to me.\"  The whole modern world is pining for a genuinely sensational  journalism. This has been discovered by that very able and honest  journalist, Mr. Blatchford, who started his campaign against  Christianity, warned on all sides, I believe, that it would ruin his  paper, but who continued from an honourable sense of intellectual  responsibility. He discovered, however, that while he had undoubtedly  shocked his readers, he had also greatly advanced his newspaper. It was  bought--first, by all the people who agreed with him and wanted to read  it; and secondly, by all the people who disagreed with him, and wanted  to write him letters.  Those letters were voluminous (I helped, I am  glad to say, to swell their volume), and they were generally inserted  with a generous fulness.  Thus was accidentally discovered (like the  steam-engine) the great journalistic maxim--that if an editor can only  make people angry enough, they will write half his newspaper for him  for nothing.    Some hold that such papers as these are scarcely the proper objects of  so serious a consideration; but that can scarcely be maintained from a  political or ethical point of view. In this problem of the mildness and  tameness of the Harmsworth mind there is mirrored the outlines of a  much larger problem which is akin to it.    The Harmsworthian journalist begins with a worship of success and  violence, and ends in sheer timidity and mediocrity. But he is not  alone in this, nor does he come by this fate merely because he happens  personally to be stupid.  Every man, however brave, who begins by  worshipping violence, must end in mere timidity. Every man, however  wise, who begins by worshipping success, must end in mere mediocrity.  This strange and paradoxical fate is involved, not in the individual,  but in the philosophy, in the point of view. It is not the folly of the  man which brings about this necessary fall; it is his wisdom.  The  worship of success is the only one out of all possible worships of  which this is true, that its followers are foredoomed to become slaves  and cowards. A man may be a hero for the sake of Mrs. Gallup's ciphers  or for the sake of human sacrifice, but not for the sake of success.  For obviously a man may choose to fail because he loves Mrs. Gallup or  human sacrifice; but he cannot choose to fail because he loves success.  When the test of triumph is men's test of everything, they never endure  long enough to triumph at all. As long as matters are really hopeful,  hope is a mere flattery or platitude; it is only when everything is  hopeless that hope begins to be a strength at all.  Like all the  Christian virtues, it is as unreasonable as it is indispensable.    It was through this fatal paradox in the nature of things that all  these modern adventurers come at last to a sort of tedium and  acquiescence. They desired strength; and to them to desire strength was  to admire strength; to admire strength was simply to admire the statu  quo. They thought that he who wished to be strong ought to respect the  strong. They did not realize the obvious verity that he who wishes to  be strong must despise the strong.  They sought to be everything, to  have the whole force of the cosmos behind them, to have an energy that  would drive the stars.  But they did not realize the two great  facts--first, that in the attempt to be everything the first and most  difficult step is to be something; second, that the moment a man is  something, he is essentially defying everything. The lower animals, say  the men of science, fought their way up with a blind selfishness.  If  this be so, the only real moral of it is that our unselfishness, if it  is to triumph, must be equally blind. The mammoth did not put his head  on one side and wonder whether mammoths were a little out of date.  Mammoths were at least as much up to date as that individual mammoth  could make them. The great elk did not say, \"Cloven hoofs are very much  worn now.\" He polished his own weapons for his own use.  But in the  reasoning animal there has arisen a more horrible danger, that he may  fail through perceiving his own failure.  When modern sociologists talk  of the necessity of accommodating one's self to the trend of the time,  they forget that the trend of the time at its best consists entirely of  people who will not accommodate themselves to anything. At its worst it  consists of many millions of frightened creatures all accommodating  themselves to a trend that is not there. And that is becoming more and  more the situation of modern England. Every man speaks of public  opinion, and means by public opinion, public opinion minus his opinion.  Every man makes his contribution negative under the erroneous  impression that the next man's contribution is positive.  Every man  surrenders his fancy to a general tone which is itself a surrender. And  over all the heartless and fatuous unity spreads this new and wearisome  and platitudinous press, incapable of invention, incapable of audacity,  capable only of a servility all the more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#14)"],[1,"against the Church, crucified the Savior and killed the  apostles, the keys of the kingdom were taken from the earth. John the  Revelator describes it most clearly. And from that time until Joseph  Smith was called by the voice of the Almighty, and ordained to hold  those keys, no man held them upon the earth that we know of. It is  true the Lord did appoint other Twelve upon this continent, and his  Church flourished and prospered in this land for many years, but the  Lord declared that Peter, James and John, and the Twelve that walked  with him at Jerusalem, held the presidency over them. God may reveal  himself to different nations, and establish among them the same gospel  and ordinances as he did anciently, if necessity require, but if these  nations should be joined together there would be one head, and all the  rest would be subordinate. So that from the time that the keys of this  priesthood were taken from the earth until they were received by Joseph  Smith, no man ever possessed that priesthood, nor the keys thereof,  with authority to build up the Zion of God, and prepare a church or  people for the second coming of Christ, \"as a bride is adorned for the  bridegroom,\" unless it may have been among the lost tribes, yet of this  we have no knowledge, but if so they would receive those keys necessary  to administer in the ordinances of the gospel for their salvation.  We know not of their existence or the condition in which they are  placed. The gospel that is given to them is suited to their needs and  conditions, and is for their salvation, not ours; and yet, it will be  the same gospel. And God will not call one from them to give to us the  priesthood, or to give to us the keys and {55} blessings, or to point  out the organizations of the kingdom of God, because he has established  that priesthood here, and we have it. If he has any communication to  make to us he will send his messengers to us. And in this way he will  deliver his law and give his mind and will to the people. He will do it  through the ordained channels of the priesthood which he acknowledges  and which he has established in the earth. He will go nowhere else to  do it, neither will he send us to them, unless they should be without  the priesthood and it becomes necessary to take the blessings of the  gospel to them, and I presume that will be the case.    When Joseph received the keys of the priesthood, he alone on the earth  held them; that is, he was the first, he stood at the head. It was  promised that he should not lose them nor be removed out of his place,  as long as he was faithful. And when he died, President Young was  chosen by the voice of the people, and sanctioned by the voice of God.  He held the priesthood which was after the order of the Son of God,  with the keys which pertain to the presidency of that priesthood upon  earth. He received it from the hands of Joseph, directly from him or  by his authority; and he held it until his death. When he died, that  mantle fell upon John Taylor, and while he lives he will hold that  authority, inasmuch as he is faithful. So it was with President Brigham  Young; he held it on condition of his faithfulness. If any man in that  position should become unfaithful, God would remove him out of his  place. I testify in the name of Israel's God that he will not suffer  the head of the Church, whom he has chosen to stand at the head, to  transgress his laws and apostatize; the moment he should take a course  that would in time lead to it, God would take him away. Why? Because  to suffer a wicked man to occupy that position would be to allow, as  it were, the fountain to become corrupted, which is something he will  never permit.    {56} The moment a man says he will not submit to the legally  constituted authority of the Church, whether it be the teachers, the  bishopric, the high council, his quorum, or the First Presidency,  and in his heart confirms it and carries it out, that moment he cuts  himself off from the privileges and blessings of the priesthood and  Church, and severs himself from the people of God, for he ignores the  authority that the Lord has instituted in his Church. These are the men  that generally get crotchets in their heads, that get inspiration (from  beneath), and that are often so desirous to guide the Church, and to  sit in judgment upon the priesthood. The only safe way for us to do,  as individuals, is to live so humbly, so righteously and so faithfully  before God that we may possess his Spirit to that extent that we shall  be able to judge righteously, and discern between truth and error,  between right and wrong; and then we shall know when a decision is  rendered against us that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, we  are in error, and that the decision is right; and although we may, at  the time, not be fully able to see and feel its justness, yet will be  constrained to say that \"inasmuch as there are sixteen chances against  one for me to be wrong, I will gracefully and, humbly submit.\" The pith  of the matter is: the Lord has established his Church, organized his  priesthood, and conferred authority upon certain individuals, councils  and quorums, and it is the duty of the people of God to live so that  they shall know that these are acceptable unto him. If we begin to  cut off this one and that one, and set their authority aside, we may  just as well at once set God aside, and say that he has no right to  dictate.--_Journal of Discourses,_ Vol. 24, pp. 187-194, 1884, Ogden,  June 21, 1883.    THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS. I say to my brethren that the book of  Doctrine and Covenants contains some of the most glorious principles  ever revealed to the world, some that have been revealed in greater  fulness than they were {57} ever revealed before to the world; and  this, in fulfilment of the promise of the ancient prophets that in the  latter times the Lord would reveal things to the world that had been  kept bidden from the foundation thereof; and the Lord has revealed them  through the Prophet Joseph Smith.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1913, p. 9.    HOW TO READ THE BIBLE. That which characterizes above all else the  inspiration and divinity of the Scriptures is the spirit in which  they are written and the spiritual wealth they convey to those who  faithfully and conscientiously read them. Our attitude, therefore,  toward the Scriptures should be in harmony with the purposes for  which they were written. They are intended to enlarge man's spiritual  endowments and to reveal and intensify the bond of relationship between  him and his God. The Bible, as all other books of Holy Writ, to be  appreciated must be studied by those spiritually inclined and who are  in quest of spiritual truths.--_Juvenile Instructor,_ Vol. 47, p. 204,  April, 1912.    PERSECUTION FOLLOWS REVELATION. I do not believe there ever was a  people who were guided by revelation, or acknowledged of the Lord as  his people, who were not hated and persecuted by the wicked and the  corrupt, and perhaps no people were ever more persecuted than this  people would be if it were in the power of the enemy today to persecute  us as it was in the power of Nero and the Romans to persecute the  Saints in their day. There never was a time when it was more fixed and  determined in the heart of the wicked to fight against and destroy the  kingdom from the earth than now, and their failure will be due only  to the impossibility of the task they have undertaken. And this is an  evidence to everyone that God's priesthood is here, that many of the  Saints are magnifying their calling and honoring the priesthood and  also the Lord, both with their lives and with their substance, which  are his.--_Deseret Weekly News,_ Vol. 24, p. 708, 1875.    {58}        CHAPTER IV    FREE AGENCY    THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS A FREE PEOPLE. We will now present before the  conference the names of the general authorities of the Church, with  the earnest desire that all the members of the Church present, who  by reason of their good standing before the Lord are entitled to the  privilege, will express their will according to the God-given agency  that every man in the world enjoys, and which is not lessened, but  rather increased, in all those who have made covenant with God by  sacrifice and through obedience to the principles of the gospel. The  freedom of the Latter-day Saints has never been curtailed nor lessened  one whit by their becoming members of the Church of Christ. Rather  has it been enlarged. There are no freer people upon the face of the  earth today than the Latter-day Saints. They are bound to the Church  by no ties or strings, but by their own conviction of the truth. And  whenever a man makes up his mind that he has had enough of what is  called \"Mormonism,\" all he has to do is to make it known, and we will  sever the bond that unites him with the body and let him go his own  way, only bearing toward him the feeling of sympathy and true brotherly  kindness, and wishing him still the mercies of God. We will cry,  \"Father, have mercy upon him,\" because he knows not what he is doing.  For when a man denies the truth, when he departs from the right way,  when he rejects the right of God to counsel in the affairs of men, he  is either ignorant or wilfully wicked, and it only excites our pity  for him. As the Savior cried upon the cross, so we will cry in the  same spirit, Father, forgive him; have mercy upon him; for he knows  not what he does. {59} Therefore, we expect only those to vote at this  time who are members of the Church in good standing, but all such we do  expect to vote, according to their own free will, whether it be yea or  nay. However, we wish it distinctly understood that no question upon  these matters will be discussed in this conference; for this is not  the place to discuss questions of difference or of feeling that we may  possess one towards another. Still we can manifest our"]]]
