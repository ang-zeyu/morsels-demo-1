And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of             Araunah the Jebusite.    10:024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote             the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done             wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine             hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's             house.    10:024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear             an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the             Jebusite.    10:024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD             commanded.    10:024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming             on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before             the king on his face upon the ground.    10:024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his             servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to             build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed             from the people.    10:024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and             offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for             burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other             instruments of the oxen for wood.    10:024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.             And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.    10:024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it             of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto             the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David             bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of             silver.    10:024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered             burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated             for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8019"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 19: Psalms (#14)"],[1,"       continually of thee.    19:071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.    19:071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all             the day.    19:071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my             strength faileth.    19:071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for             my soul take counsel together,    19:071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for             there is none to deliver him.    19:071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.    19:071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my             soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that             seek my hurt.    19:071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and             more.    19:071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation             all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.    19:071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention             of thy righteousness, even of thine only.    19:071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I             declared thy wondrous works.    19:071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;             until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy             power to every one that is to come.    19:071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done             great things: O God, who is like unto thee!    19:071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt             quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths             of the earth.    19:071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every             side.    19:071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O             my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One             of Israel.    19:071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my             soul, which thou hast redeemed.    19:071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day             long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto             shame, that seek my hurt.    19:072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto             the king's son.    19:072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor             with judgment.    19:072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little             hills, by righteousness.    19:072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the             children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the             oppressor.    19:072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,             throughout all generations.    19:072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers             that water the earth.    19:072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of             peace so long as the moon endureth.    19:072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the             river unto the ends of the earth.    19:072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and             his enemies shall lick the dust.    19:072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:             the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.    19:072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall             serve him.    19:072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,             and him that hath no helper.    19:072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of             the needy.    19:072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and             precious shall their blood be in his sight.    19:072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of             Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and             daily shall he be praised.    19:072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of             the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and             they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.    19:072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as             long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations             shall call him blessed.    19:072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth             wondrous things.    19:072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole             earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.    19:072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.    19:073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean             heart.    19:073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well             nigh slipped.    19:073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of             the wicked.    19:073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is             firm.    19:073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued             like other men.    19:073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence             covereth them as a garment.    19:073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart             could wish.    19:073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:             they speak loftily.    19:073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue             walketh through the earth.    19:073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup             are wrung out to them.    19:073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the             most High?    19:073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they             increase in riches.    19:073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands             in innocency.    19:073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every             morning.    19:073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against             the generation of thy children.    19:073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;    19:073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I             their end.    19:073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst             them down into destruction.    19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are             utterly consumed with terrors.    19:073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,             thou shalt despise their image.    19:073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.    19:073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.    19:073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me             by my right hand.    19:073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me             to glory.    19:073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth             that I desire beside thee.    19:073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my             heart, and my portion for ever.    19:073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast             destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.    19:073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust             in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.    19:074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine             anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?    19:074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;             the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this             mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.    19:074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that             the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.    19:074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set             up their ensigns for signs.    19:074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the             thick trees.    19:074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with             axes and hammers.    19:074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by             casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.    19:074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they             have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.    19:074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is             there among us any that knoweth how long.    19:074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy             blaspheme thy name for ever?    19:074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it             out of thy bosom.    19:074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of             the earth.    19:074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the             heads of the dragons in the waters.    19:074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him             to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.    19:074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up             mighty rivers.    19:074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared             the light and the sun.    19:074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made             summer and winter.    19:074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and             that the foolish people"]]]
