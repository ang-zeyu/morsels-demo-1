When he died, he asked to be buried, not in the monk's  cemetery, but with his father and mother, in the churchyard. He made  request that no name, record, or epitaph, be chiseled on his tomb, but  only these words:    WE CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST THE TRUTH, BUT ONLY FOR THE TRUTH.          XIV      THE WELSHERY AND THE NORMANS      Though their land has been many times invaded, the Welsh have never  been conquered. Powerful tribes, like the Romans, Saxons and Normans,  have tried to overwhelm them. Even when English and German kings  attempted to crush their spirit and blot out their language and  literature, the Welsh resisted and won victory.    Among the bullies that tried force, instead of justice, and played the  slave-driver, rather than the Good Samaritan's way, were the Normans.  These brutal fellows, when they thought that they had overrun Wales  with their armies, began to build strong castles all over the country.  They kept armed men by the thousands ready, night and day, to rush out  and put to death anybody and everybody who had a weapon in his hand.  Often they burned whole villages. They killed so many Welsh people  that it seemed at times as if they expected to empty the land of its  inhabitants. Thus, they hoped to possess all the acres for themselves.  They talked as if there were no people so refined and so cultured as  they were, while the natives, good and bad, were lumped together as  \"the Welshery.\"    Yet all this time, with these hundreds of strong castles, bristling  with turrets and towers, no Englishman's life was safe. If he dared to  go out alone, even twenty rods from the castle, he was instantly  killed by some angry Welshman lying in ambush. So the Normans had to  lock themselves up in armor, until they looked like lobsters in their  shells. When on their iron-clad horses they resembled turtles, so that  if a knight fell off, he had to be chopped open to be rid of his metal  clothes.    Yet all this was in vain, for when the Norman marched out in bodies,  or rode in squadrons, the Welshery kept away and were hidden.    Even the birds and beasts noticed this, and saw what fools the Normans  were, to behave so brutally.    As for the fairies, they met together to see what could be done. Even  the reptiles shamed men by living together more peaceably. Only the  beasts of prey approved of the Norman way of treating the Welsh  people.    At last, it came to pass that, after the long War of the Roses, when  the Reds and the Whites had fought together, a Welsh king sat upon the  throne of England. Henry VIII was of Cymric ancestry. His full name  was Henry Tudor; or, in English, Henry Theodore.    Among the Welsh, every son, to his own name as a child, such as Henry,  William, Thomas, etc., added that of his father. Thus it happens that  we can usually tell a man by his name; for example, Richards, Roberts,  Evans, Jones, etc., etc., that he is a Welshman.    When a Welshman went into England to live, if he were a sister's son,  he usually added a syllable showing this, as in the case of Jefferson,  which means sister's son. Our great Thomas Jefferson used to boast  that he could talk Welsh.    So the living creatures of all sorts in Wales, human beings, fairies,  and animals took heart and plucked up courage, when a Tudor king,  Henry VIII, sat on the throne.    Now it was Puck who led the fairies as the great peacemaker. He went  first to visit all the most ancient creatures, in order to find out  who should be offered the post of honor, as ambassador, who should be  sent to the great king in London, Henry Tudor, to see what could be  done for Wales.    First he called on the male eagle, oldest of all birds. Though not  bald-headed, like his American cousin, the Welsh eagle was very old,  and at that time a widower. Although he had been father to nine  generations of eaglets, he sent Puck to the stag.    This splendid creature, with magnificent antlers, lived at the edge of  the forest, near the trunk of an oak tree. It was still standing, but  was now a mere shell. Old men said that the children of the aborigines  played under it, and here was the home of the god of lightning, which  they worshiped.    So to the withered oak, Puck went, and offered him the honor of  leadership to an embassy to the King.    But the stag answered and said:    \"Well do I remember when an acorn fell from the top of the parent oak.  Then, for three hundred years it was growing. Children played under  it. They gathered acorns in their aprons, and the archers made bows  from its boughs.    \"Then the oak tree began to die, and, during nearly thirty tens of  years it has been fading, and I have seen it all.    \"Yet there is one older than I. It is the salmon that swims in the  Llyn stream. Inquire there.\"    So of the old mother salmon, Puck went to ask, and this was the answer  which he received.    \"Count all the spots on my body, and all the eggs in my roe--one for  each year. Yet the blackbird is older even than I. Go listen to her  story. She excels me, in both talk and fact.\"    And the blackbird opened its orange-colored bill, and answered  proudly:    \"Do you see this flinty rock, on which I am sitting? Once it was so  huge that three hundred yoke of oxen could hardly move it. Yet, today,  it hardly more than affords me room to roost on.    \"What made it so small, do you ask?    \"Well, all I have clone to wear it away, has been to wipe my beak on  it, every night, before I go to sleep, and in the morning to brush it  with the tips of my wing.\"    Even Puck, fairy though he was, was astonished at this. But the  blackbird added:    \"Go to the toad, that blinks its eye under the big rock yonder. His  age is greater than mine.\"    The toad was half asleep when Puck came, but it opened with alertness,  its beautiful round bright eyes, set in a rim of gold. Then Puck asked  the question: \"Oh, thou that carriest a jewel in thy head, are there  any things alive that are older than thou art?\"    \"That, I could not be sure of, especially if as many false things are  told about them, as are told about me; but when I was a tadpole in the  pond, that old hag of an owl was still hooting away, in the treetops,  scaring children, as in ages gone. She is older than I. Go and see  her. If age makes wise, she is the wisest of all.\"    Puck went into the forest, but at first saw no bird answering to the  description given him.    He said to himself, \"She is, I wonder, who?\"    He was surprised to hear his question repeated, not as an echo, but by  another. Still, he thought it might possibly be his own voice come  back.    So, in making a catalogue, in his note book, of what he had seen and  heard that day, he put down, \"To wit--one echo.\"    Again came the sound:    \"To whit--to who, to whit--to who?\" Sounded the voice.    Thinking that this was intended to be a polite question, Puck looked  up. Sure enough, there was the wise bird sitting on a bough, above  him, as sober as a judge.    \"Who! did you ask?\" answered Puck and then went on to explain:    \"I am Lord of the Fairies in Welshery, and I seek to know which is the  most venerable, of all the creatures in the Land of the Red Dragon.    \"I am ready to salute you, as the most ancient and honorable of all  living things in the Cymric realm. You are desired to bear a message  to the Great King, in London.\"    Tickled by such delicate flattery, and the honors proffered her, this  lady owl, after much blinking and winking, flirting, and fluttering,  at last agreed to go to King Henry VIII in London. The business, with  which she was charged, was to protest against Norman brutality and to  plead for justice.    Now this old lady-owl, gray with centuries, though she had such short  ears, kept them open by day and during the night, also, for all the  gossip that floated in the air. She knew all about everybody and  everything. From what she had heard, she expected to find the new  King, Henry VIII, a royal fellow in velvet, with a crown on his head,  and his body as big and round as a hogshead, sitting in a room full of  chopping blocks and battle axes. Further, she fancied she would find a  dozen pretty women locked up in his palace, some in the cellar, others  in the pantry, and more in the garret; but all waiting to have their  heads chopped off.    For the popular story ran that his chief amusement was to marry a wife  one day and slice off her head the next.    It was said also that the King kept a private graveyard, and took a  walk in it every afternoon to study the epitaphs, which he kept a  scholar busy in writing; and also a man, from the marble yard near by,  to chisel them on the tombs, after his various wives had been properly  beheaded.    But the owl never could find out whether these fables were wicked  fibs, or fairy tales, or only street talk.    Puck and the owl together arrived in London, at the palace, when the  King was at his dinner. The butlers and lackeys wanted to keep them  out, but the merry monarch gave orders to let them in at once. He made  the owl perch over the mantel piece, but told Puck to stand upon the  dinner table and walk over the tablecloth. The pepper box was put  away, so that he should not sneeze and the King carefully removed the  mustard pot, for fear the little fairy fellow might fall in it and be  drowned in the hot stuff.    His Majesty said that, for the time being, Puck should be the Prince  of Wales. Puck strutted about to the amusement of the King and all the  Court ladies, but he kept away from the pepper, which made his nose  tingle, and from the hot soup, for fear he might tumble into it and be  scalded. When the dessert came on, Puck hid himself under a walnut  shell, just for fun.    It would take too long to tell about all that was said, or the  questions, which the King asked about his Welsh subjects, and which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#14)"],[1,"oncertina's melancholy string!

They played him a sonata--let me see!    \"_Medulla oblongata_\"--key of G.

The elder of the brothers gave a squeal,    All-overish it made me for to feel!            \"Oh Prince,\" he says, says he,            \"_If a Prince indeed you be_,    I've a mystery I'm going to reveal!\"      \"Oh, listen, if you'd shun a horrid death,    To what the gent who's speaking to you, saith:            No 'Oiiaits' in truth are we,            As you fancy that we be,    For (ter-remble) I am Aleck--this is Beth!\"      Said Agib, \"Oh! accursed of your kind,    I have heard that you are men of evil mind!\"            Beth gave a dreadful shriek--            But before he'd time to speak    I was mercilessly collared from behind.      In number ten or twelve or even more,    They fastened me, full length upon the floor.            On my face extended flat            I was walloped with a cat    For listening at the key-hole of the door.      Oh! the horror of that agonizing thrill!    (I can feel the place in frosty weather still).            For a week from ten to four            I was fastened to the floor,    While a mercenary wopped me with a will!      They branded me, and broke me on a wheel,    And they left me in an hospital to heal;            And, upon my solemn word,            I have never never heard    What those Tartars had determined to reveal.

GENERAL JOHN      The bravest names for fire and flames,        And all that mortal durst,    Were General John and Private James,        Of the Sixty-seventy-first.      General John was a soldier tried,        A chief of warlike dons;    A haughty stride and a withering pride        Were Major-General John.      A sneer would play on his martial phiz,        Superior birth to show;    \"Pish!\" was a favorite word of his,        And he often said \"Ho! Ho!\"      Full-Private James described might be,        As a man of mournful mind;    No characteristic trait had he        Of any distinctive kind.      From the ranks, one day, cried Private James,        \"Oh! Major-General John,    I've doubts of our respective names,        My mournful mind upon.\"      \"A glimmering thought occurs to me,        (Its source I can't unearth),    But I've a kind of notion we        Were cruelly changed at birth.\"      \"I've a strange idea, each other's names        That we have each got on.    Such things have been,\" said Private James.        \"They have!\" sneered General John.      \"My General John, I swear upon        My oath I think it is so--\"    \"Pish!\" proudly sneered his General John,        And he also said \"Ho! ho!\"      \"My General John! my General John!        My General John!\" quoth he,    \"This aristocratical sneer upon        Your face I blush to see.\"      \"No truly great or generous cove        Deserving of them names    Would sneer at a fixed idea that's drove        In the mind of a Private James!\"      Said General John, \"Upon your claims        No need your breath to waste;    If this is a joke, Full-Private James,        It's a joke of doubtful taste.\"      \"But being a man of doubtless worth,        If you feel certain quite    That we were probably changed at birth,        I'll venture to say you're right.\"      So General John as Private James        Fell in, parade upon;    And Private James, by change of names,        Was Major-General John.                              _W.S. Gilbert_          LITTLE BILLEE      There were three sailors of Bristol City        Who took a boat and went to sea,    But first with beef and captain's biscuits,        And pickled pork they loaded she.      There was gorging Jack, and guzzling Jimmy,        And the youngest he was little Billee.    Now when they'd got as far as the Equator,        They'd nothing left but one split pea.      Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,        \"I am extremely hungaree.\"    To gorging Jack says guzzling Jimmy,        \"We've nothing left, us must eat we.\"      Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,        \"With one another we shouldn't agree!    There's little Bill, he's young and tender,        We're old and tough, so let's eat he.\"      \"O Billy! we're going to kill and eat you,        So undo the button of your chemie.\"    When Bill received this information,        He used his pocket-handkerchie,      \"First let me say my catechism,        Which my poor mother taught to me.\"    \"Make haste! make haste!\" says guzzling Jimmy,        While Jack pulled out his snicker-snee.      Then Bill went up to the main-top-gallant-mast,        And down he fell on his bended knee,    He scarce had come to the Twelfth Commandment        When up he jumps--\"There's land I see!\"      \"Jerusalem and Madagascar,        And North and South Amerikee,    There's the British flag a-riding at anchor,        With Admiral Napier, K.C.B.\"      So when they got aboard of the Admiral's,        He hanged fat Jack and flogged Jimmee,    But as for little Bill, he made him        The captain of a Seventy-three.                              _W.
