I came to anchor at  midnight in Three Island Cove, about twenty miles along from Fortescue  Bay. I saw on the opposite side of the strait signal-fires, and heard  the barking of dogs, but where I lay it was quite deserted by natives.  I have always taken it as a sign that where I found birds sitting  about, or seals on the rocks, I should not find savage Indians. Seals  are never plentiful in these waters, but in Three Island Cove I saw  one on the rocks, and other signs of the absence of savage men.    [Illustration: A brush with Fuegians]    On the next day the wind was again blowing a gale, and although she  was in the lee of the land, the sloop dragged her anchors, so that I  had to get her under way and beat farther into the cove, where I came  to in a landlocked pool. At another time or place this would have been  a rash thing to do, and it was safe now only from the fact that the  gale which drove me to shelter would keep the Indians from crossing  the strait. Seeing this was the case, I went ashore with gun and ax on  an island, where I could not in any event be surprised, and there  felled trees and split about a cord of fire-wood, which loaded my  small boat several times.    While I carried the wood, though I was morally sure there were no  savages near, I never once went to or from the skiff without my gun.  While I had that and a clear field of over eighty yards about me I  felt safe.    The trees on the island, very scattering, were a sort of beech and a  stunted cedar, both of which made good fuel. Even the green limbs of  the beech, which seemed to possess a resinous quality, burned readily  in my great drum-stove. I have described my method of wooding up in  detail, that the reader who has kindly borne with me so far may see  that in this, as in all other particulars of my voyage, I took great  care against all kinds of surprises, whether by animals or by the  elements. In the Strait of Magellan the greatest vigilance was  necessary. In this instance I reasoned that I had all about me the  greatest danger of the whole voyage--the treachery of cunning savages,  for which I must be particularly on the alert.    The _Spray_ sailed from Three Island Cove in the morning after the  gale went down, but was glad to return for shelter from another sudden  gale. Sailing again on the following day, she fetched Borgia Bay, a  few miles on her course, where vessels had anchored from time to time  and had nailed boards on the trees ashore with name and date of  harboring carved or painted. Nothing else could I see to indicate that  civilized man had ever been there. I had taken a survey of the gloomy  place with my spy-glass, and was getting my boat out to land and take  notes, when the Chilean gunboat _Huemel_ came in, and officers, coming  on board, advised me to leave the place at once, a thing that required  little eloquence to persuade me to do. I accepted the captain's kind  offer of a tow to the next anchorage, at the place called Notch Cove,  eight miles farther along, where I should be clear of the worst of the  Fuegians.    [Illustration: A bit of friendly assistance. (After a sketch by  Midshipman Miguel Arenas.)]    We made anchorage at the cove about dark that night, while the wind  came down in fierce williwaws from the mountains. An instance of  Magellan weather was afforded when the _Huemel_, a well-appointed  gunboat of great power, after attempting on the following day to  proceed on her voyage, was obliged by sheer force of the wind to  return and take up anchorage again and remain till the gale abated;  and lucky she was to get back!    Meeting this vessel was a little godsend. She was commanded and  officered by high-class sailors and educated gentlemen. An  entertainment that was gotten up on her, impromptu, at the Notch would  be hard to beat anywhere. One of her midshipmen sang popular songs in  French, German, and Spanish, and one (so he said) in Russian. If the  audience did not know the lingo of one song from another, it was no  drawback to the merriment.    I was left alone the next day, for then the _Huemel_ put out on her  voyage the gale having abated. I spent a day taking in wood and water;  by the end of that time the weather was fine. Then I sailed from the  desolate place.    There is little more to be said concerning the _Spray's_ first passage  through the strait that would differ from what I have already  recorded. She anchored and weighed many times, and beat many days  against the current, with now and then a \"slant\" for a few miles, till  finally she gained anchorage and shelter for the night at Port Tamar,  with Cape Pillar in sight to the west. Here I felt the throb of the  great ocean that lay before me. I knew now that I had put a world  behind me, and that I was opening out another world ahead. I had  passed the haunts of savages. Great piles of granite mountains of  bleak and lifeless aspect were now astern; on some of them not even a  speck of moss had ever grown. There was an unfinished newness all  about the land. On the hill back of Port Tamar a small beacon had been  thrown up, showing that some man had been there. But how could one  tell but that he had died of loneliness and grief? In a bleak land is  not the place to enjoy solitude.    Throughout the whole of the strait west of Cape Froward I saw no  animals except dogs owned by savages. These I saw often enough, and  heard them yelping night and day. Birds were not plentiful. The scream  of a wild fowl, which I took for a loon, sometimes startled me with  its piercing cry. The steamboat duck, so called because it propels  itself over the sea with its wings, and resembles a miniature  side-wheel steamer in its motion, was sometimes seen scurrying on out  of danger. It never flies, but, hitting the water instead of the air  with its wings, it moves faster than a rowboat or a canoe. The few  fur-seals I saw were very shy; and of fishes I saw next to none at  all. I did not catch one; indeed, I seldom or never put a hook over  during the whole voyage. Here in the strait I found great abundance of  mussels of an excellent quality. I fared sumptuously on them. There  was a sort of swan, smaller than a Muscovy duck, which might have been  brought down with the gun, but in the loneliness of life about the  dreary country I found myself in no mood to make one life less, except  in self-defense.

It was the 3d of March when the _Spray_ sailed from Port Tamar direct  for Cape Pillar, with the wind from the northeast, which I fervently  hoped might hold till she cleared the land; but there was no such good  luck in store. It soon began to rain and thicken in the northwest,  boding no good. The _Spray_ reared Cape Pillar rapidly, and, nothing  loath, plunged into the Pacific Ocean at once, taking her first bath  of it in the gathering storm. There was no turning back even had I  wished to do so, for the land was now shut out by the darkness of  night. The wind freshened, and I took in a third reef. The sea was  confused and treacherous. In such a time as this the old fisherman  prayed, \"Remember, Lord, my ship is small and thy sea is so wide!\" I  saw now only the gleaming crests of the waves. They showed white teeth  while the sloop balanced over them. \"Everything for an offing,\" I  cried, and to this end I carried on all the sail she would bear. She  ran all night with a free sheet, but on the morning of March 4 the  wind shifted to southwest, then back suddenly to northwest, and blew  with terrific force. The _Spray_, stripped of her sails, then bore off  under bare poles. No ship in the world could have stood up against so  violent a gale. Knowing that this storm might continue for many days,  and that it would be impossible to work back to the westward along the  coast outside of Tierra del Fuego, there seemed nothing to do but to  keep on and go east about, after all. Anyhow, for my present safety  the only course lay in keeping her before the wind. And so she drove  southeast, as though about to round the Horn, while the waves rose and  fell and bellowed their never-ending story of the sea; but the Hand  that held these held also the _Spray_. She was running now with a  reefed forestaysail, the sheets flat amidship. I paid out two long  ropes to steady her course and to break combing seas astern, and I  lashed the helm amidship. In this trim she ran before it, shipping  never a sea. Even while the storm raged at its worst, my ship was  wholesome and noble. My mind as to her seaworthiness was put at ease  for aye.    [Illustration: Cape Pillar.]    When all had been done that I could do for the safety of the vessel, I  got to the fore-scuttle, between seas, and prepared a pot of coffee  over a wood fire, and made a good Irish stew. Then, as before and  afterward on the _Spray_, I insisted on warm meals. In the tide-race  off Cape Pillar, however, where the sea was marvelously high, uneven,  and crooked, my appetite was slim, and for a time I postponed cooking.  (Confidentially, I was seasick!)    The first day of the storm gave the _Spray_ her actual test in the  worst sea that Cape Horn or its wild regions could afford, and in no  part of the world could a rougher sea be found than at this particular  point, namely, off Cape Pillar, the grim sentinel of the Horn.    Farther offshore, while the sea was majestic, there was less  apprehension of danger. There the _Spray_ rode, now like a bird on the  crest of a wave, and now like a waif deep down in the hollow between  seas; and so she drove on. Whole days passed, counted as other days, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#14)"],[1,"place. We took advantage of the  boat to survey the land, which enclosed a large bay.    The small part of the island of Graciosa which we traversed,  resembles those promontories of lava seen near Naples, between  Portici and Torre del Greco. The rocks are naked, with no marks of  vegetation, and scarcely any of vegetable soil. A few crustaceous  lichen-like variolariae, leprariae, and urceorariae, were scattered  about upon the basalts. The lavas which are not covered with  volcanic ashes remain for ages without any appearance of  vegetation. On the African soil excessive heat and lengthened  drought retard the growth of cryptogamous plants.    The basalts of Graciosa are not in columns, but are divided into  strata ten or fifteen inches thick. These strata are inclined at an  angle of 80 degrees to the north-west. The compact basalt  alternates with the strata of porous basalt and marl. The rock does  not contain hornblende, but great crystals of foliated olivine,  which have a triple cleavage.* (* Blaettriger olivin.) This  substance is decomposed with great difficulty. M. Hauy considers it  a variety of the pyroxene. The porous basalt, which passes into  mandelstein, has oblong cavities from two to eight lines in  diameter, lined with chalcedony, enclosing fragments of compact  basalt. I did not remark that these cavities had the same  direction, or that the porous rock lay on compact strata, as  happens in the currents of lava of Etna and Vesuvius. The marl,* (*  Mergel.) which alternates more than a hundred times with the  basalts, is yellowish, friable by decomposition, very coherent in  the inside, and often divided into irregular prisms, analogous to  the basaltic prisms. The sun discolours their surface, as it  whitens several schists, by reviving a hydro-carburetted principle,  which appears to be combined with the earth. The marl of Graciosa  contains a great quantity of chalk, and strongly effervesces with  nitric acid, even on points where it is found in contact with the  basalt. This fact is the more remarkable, as this substance does  not fill the fissures of the rock, but its strata are parallel to  those of the basalt; whence we may conclude that both fossils are  of the same formation, and have a common origin. The phenomenon of  a basaltic rock containing masses of indurated marl split into  small columns, is also found in the Mittelgebirge, in Bohemia.  Visiting those countries in 1792, in company with Mr. Freiesleben,  we even recognized in the marl of the Stiefelberg the imprint of a  plant nearly resembling the Cerastium, or the Alsine. Are these  strata, contained in the trappean mountains, owing to muddy  irruptions, or must we consider them as sediments of water, which  alternate with volcanic deposits? This last hypothesis seems so  much the less admissible, since, from the researches of Sir James  Hall on the influence of pressure in fusions, the existence of  carbonic acid in substances contained in basalt presents nothing  surprising. Several lavas of Vesuvius present similar phenomena. In  Lombardy, between Vicenza and Albano, where the calcareous stone of  the Jura contains great masses of basalt, I have seen the latter  enter into effervescence with the acids wherever it touches the  calcareous rock.    We had not time to reach the summit of a hill very remarkable for  having its base formed of banks of clay under strata of basalt,  like a mountain in Saxony, called the Scheibenbergen Hugel, which  is become celebrated on account of the disputes of volcanean and  neptunean geologists. These basalts were covered with a mammiform  substance, which I vainly sought on the Peak of Teneriffe, and  which is known by the names of volcanic glass, glass of Muller, or  hyalite: it is the transition from the opal to the chalcedony. We  struck off with difficulty some fine specimens, leaving masses that  were eight or ten inches square untouched. I never saw in Europe  such fine hyalites as I found in the island of Graciosa, and on the  rock of porphyry called el Penol de los Banos, on the bank of the  lake of Mexico.    Two kinds of sand cover the shore; one is black and basaltic, the  other white and quartzose. In a place exposed to the rays of the  sun, the first raised the thermometer to 51.2 degrees (41 degrees  R.) and the second to 40 degrees (32 degrees R.) The temperature of  the air in the shade was 27.7 or 7.5 degrees higher than that of  the air over the sea. The quartzose sand contains fragments of  feldspar. It is thrown back by the water, and forms, in some sort,  on the surface of the rocks, small islets on which seaweed  vegetates. Fragments of granite have been observed at Teneriffe;  the island of Gomora, from the details furnished me by M.  Broussonnet, contains a nucleus of micaceous schist:--the quartz  disseminated in the sand, which we found on the shore of Graciosa,  is a different substance from the lavas and the trappean porphyries  so intimately connected with volcanic productions. From these facts  it seems to be evident that in the Canary Islands, as well as on  the Andes of Quito, in Auvergne, in Greece, and throughout the  greater part of the globe, subterraneous fires have pierced through  the rocks of primitive formation. In treating hereafter of the  great number of warm springs which we have seen issuing from  granite, gneiss, and micaceous schist, we shall have occasion to  return to this subject, which is one of the most important of the  physical history of the globe.    We re-embarked at sunset, and hoisted sail, but the breeze was too  feeble to permit us to continue our course to Teneriffe. The sea  was calm; a reddish vapour covered the horizon, and seemed to  magnify every object. In this solitude, amidst so many uninhabited  islets, we enjoyed for a long time the view of rugged and wild  scenery. The black mountains of Graciosa appeared like  perpendicular walls five or six hundred feet high. Their shadows,  thrown over the surface of the ocean, gave a gloomy aspect to the  scenery. Rocks of basalt, emerging from the bosom of the waters,  wore the resemblance of the ruins of some vast edifice, and carried  our thoughts back to the remote period when submarine volcanoes  gave birth to new islands, or rent continents asunder. Every thing  which surrounded us seemed to indicate destruction and sterility;  but the back-ground of the picture, the coasts of Lancerota  presented a more smiling aspect. In a narrow pass between two  hills, crowned with scattered tufts of trees, marks of cultivation  were visible. The last rays of the sun gilded the corn ready for  the sickle. Even the desert is animated wherever we can discover a  trace of the industry of man.    We endeavoured to get out of this bay by the pass which separates  Alegranza from Montana Clara, and through which we had easily  entered to land at the northern point of Graciosa. The wind having  fallen, the currents drove us very near a rock, on which the sea  broke with violence, and which is noted in the old charts under the  name of Hell, or Infierno. As we examined this rock at the distance  of two cables' length, we found that it was a mass of lava three or  four toises high, full of cavities, and covered with scoriae  resembling coke. We may presume that this rock,* (* I must here  observe, that this rock is noted on the celebrated Venetian chart  of Andrea Bianco, but that the name of Infierno is given, as in the  more ancient chart of Picigano, made in 1367, to Teneriffe, without  doubt because the Guanches considered the peak as the entrance into  hell. In the same latitudes an island made its appearance in 1811.)  which modern charts call the West Rock (Roca del Oeste), was raised  by volcanic fire; and it might heretofore have been much higher;  for the new island of the Azores, which rose from the sea at  successive periods, in 1638 and 1719, had reached 354 feet when it  totally disappeared in 1723, to the depth of 480 feet. This opinion  on the origin of the basaltic mass of the Infierno is confirmed by  a phenomenon, which was observed about the middle of the last  century in these same latitudes. At the time of the eruption of the  volcano of Temanfaya, two pyramidal hills of lithoid lava rose from  the bottom of the ocean, and gradually united themselves with the  island of Lancerota.    As we were prevented by the fall of the wind, and by the currents,  from repassing the channel of Alegranza, we resolved on tacking  during the night between the island of Clara and the West Rock.  This resolution had nearly proved fatal. A calm is very dangerous  near this rock, towards which the current drives with considerable  force. We began to feel the effects of this current at midnight.  The proximity of the stony masses, which rise perpendicularly above  the water, deprived us of the little wind which blew: the sloop no  longer obeyed the helm, and we dreaded striking every instant. It  is difficult to conceive how a mass of basalt, insulated in the  vast expanse of the ocean, can cause so considerable a motion of  the waters. These phenomena, worthy the attention of naturalists,  are well known to mariners; they are extremely to be dreaded in the  Pacific ocean, particularly in the small archipelago of the islands  of Galapagos. The difference of temperature which exists between  the fluid and the mass of rocks does not explain the direction  which these currents take; and how can we admit that the water is  engulfed at the base of these rocks, (which often are not of  volcanic origin) and that this continual engulfing determines the  particles of water to fill up the vacuum that takes place.    The wind having freshened a little towards the morning on the 18th,  we succeeded in passing the channel. We drew very near the Infierno  the second time, and remarked the large crevices, through which the  gaseous fluids probably issued, when this basaltic mass was raised.  We"]]]
