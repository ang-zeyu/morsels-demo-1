Our cowboy will rob the mail coach from his horse just as they  used to do in the mountains of Arizona.\"    Snap went the whip, and away went Sable around the ring at a nice even  canter. After a few turns around Tom urged his horse on a little until  he was going on a steady run. Every one kept quiet, for most of Meadow  Brook people had heard how Sable had run away some days before.    \"There ought to be music,\" whispered Jack to Harry, for indeed the  circus was so real it only lacked a brass band.    Now Bert put on top of the soap boxes Harry's canvas schoolbag stuffed  full of papers.    \"This is the United States mail,\" he said. \"We will understand that the  coach has stopped for a few minutes.\"    Sable was going along splendidly by this time, and everybody said what  a pretty little horse he was.    \"He's goin' to steal the mail box now!\" whispered Flossie to Freddie.  \"I hope Sable won't fall or anything.\"    Snap! snap! went the whip as the horse ran faster and faster.    All of a sudden Tom got a good tight hold on the reins, then he pulled  up alongside of the mail coach, leaned over, grabbed the mail bag, and  spurred his horse at full speed around the ring.    \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted everybody.    \"Well done!\" called Uncle Daniel.    \"Couldn't be better!\" exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey.    Tom waved his hat now and patted Sable affectionately, as all good  riders do when their horses have done well in the ring.    The men admired the little horse so much they came up and asked the  \"cowboy\" a lot of questions about him, how old he was and who broke him  in.    \"One more number,\" called Bert. \"The chariot race.\"    At this all took their seats again, and out trotted two clowns, Jack  and August, each riding in a little goat wagon.    The goats were decorated with the Fourth of July buntings and the  wagons had the tailboards out and were tipped up like circus chariots.    The clowns pulled up in line.    \"One, two, three!\" called Bert, with a really big revolver up in the  air.    \"Ready! Set! Go!\" Bang! went the revolver (a blank cartridge, of  course) and away started the chariots.    Jack wore a broad green belt and August had yellow. Jack darted ahead!    \"Go it, green!\" shouted one group of boys.    \"Pass him, orange!\" called another crowd.    Now August passed Jack just as they crossed the line.    \"One!\" called Bert. \"We will have ten rounds.\"    In the next the wagons kept almost even until just within a few feet of  the line, then Jack crossed first.    \"Two!\" called Bert, while all the boys shouted for their favorite.    In the next three or four turns the riders divided even. Finally the  last round was reached and the boys had tied; that is, both were even  when the round started. This of course made the race very interesting,  as both had equal chances of winning.    \"I'll put a dollar on green,\" called Mr. Bobbsey. \"For the fresh-air  fund.\"    \"I'll put one on orange,\" called Uncle Daniel, \"for the same charity.\"    Then the ladies all wanted to bet, but Bert said it was against the  rules to allow betting.    \"We will take all the money you want to give us,\" said Bert, \"but we  cannot allow betting on the races.\"    \"All ready!\" called the ringmaster, holding his revolver high in the  air again.    Bang went the gun!    Off went the chariots!    My, how those little goats did run!    \"Go it, green!\"    \"Go it, orange!\"    Shout after shout greeted the riders as they urged their steeds around  the ring.    Suddenly Jack's chariot crossed in front of August.    \"Foul!\" called Bert, while Jack tried his best to get on his own side  again.    \"Back! back!\" yelled Jack to his horse (goat), but the little animal  was too excited to obey.    Finally fat August Stout, the funniest clown: dashed home first and won  the race!    \"Hurrah for Nero!\" called everybody. \"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted  the boys long and loud.    The circus was over!    The money was counted, and there was exactly twenty-three dollars to be  given the poor children in the Meadow Brook Fresh-Air Camp.    Wasn't that splendid? And to think everybody had such a good time too!    Freddie and Roy were allowed to ride home in the goat wagons, and they  tried to race along the way.    A committee of five boys, Bert, Harry, Jack, Tom, and August, took the  money over to the fresh-air camp the next day, and the managers said it  was a very welcome gift, for new coats were needed for some sick  children that were expected to come out from the city as soon as  provision could be made for them.    \"Somebody dropped a two-dollar bill in the ticket box,\" August told his  companions. \"Then there were the other two dollars from the race,  besides some fifty-cent pieces I don't know who gave. Of course we  couldn't make all that just on five-and ten-cent seats. And I took in  two dollars on the peanuts besides.\"    \"Well, we're all satisfied,\" said Harry. \"And I guess everybody had a  good time.\"    \"Sure they did,\" spoke up Tom, \"and I hope Bert will come out here next  year to help us with another big circus. They're the best fun we ever  had.\"    For some days every boy and girl in Meadow Brook talked about the  circus, which had really been a greater success than even the boys  themselves had expected.    It was a warm afternoon quite late in July--one of those days that make  a boy feel lazy and inclined to stretch himself.    Bert and Harry were down back of the barn sitting on the fresh stack of  hay that had just been piled up by John the stableman.    \"Did you ever try smoking?\" Harry asked Bert suddenly, as if he had  discovered something new and interesting.    \"No!\" answered Bert in surprise. \"Father wouldn't let me smoke.\"    \"Neither would pa,\" said Harry, \"but I suppose every fellow has to try  it some time. I've seen them make cigarettes out of corn silk.\"    \"I suppose that is not as bad as tobacco,\" replied Bert.    \"No,\" answered Harry, \"there's no harm in corn silk. Guess I'll try to  roll a cigarette.\"    At this Harry slid down off the hay and pulled from the fast withering  corn some dry silk.    With a good handful he went back to Bert.    \"I've got some soft paper,\" he said, sitting down again and beginning  the task.    Bert watched with interest, but really had no idea of doing wrong.    \"There!\" exclaimed Harry, giving the ends of the cigarette a twist.  \"How is that?\"    \"Pretty good,\" answered Bert; \"looks like a real one.\"    \"Let's try it!\" went on Harry.    \"Not in the hay,\" exclaimed Bert; \"you might drop the match.\"    At this Harry slid down along the side of the stack, and Bert followed.    It did seem wrong as soon as Harry struck the match, but the cigarette  being only corn silk made the boys forget all the warnings never to  smoke.    Harry gave a puff or two. Then he choked a little.    \"Kinder strong,\" he spluttered. \"You try it!\"    Bert put the cigarette in his mouth. He drew it once or twice, then  quickly tossed it aside.    \"Ouch!\" he exclaimed. \"Tastes like old shoes!\"    At that time John came up and piled on some more hay. The boys of  course had to act as if nothing had happened, and dared not look around  to find the lighted cigarette even though they wanted to very much.    \"I hope it went out,\" Bert said, as John walked away again.    \"If it didn't it's under the hay,\" said Harry, somewhat alarmed. \"But I  guess it's out.\"    \"My, look at the storm coming!\" Bert exclaimed suddenly. \"We ought to  help John with that load of hay.\"    \"All right,\" said Harry, \"come along!\" and with this the two boys  started on a run down through the fields into the open meadow, where  the dry hay was being packed up ready to put on the hay rick.    John, of course, was very glad of the help, for it spoils hay to get it  wet, so all three worked hard to load up before the heavy shower should  come up.    \"All ready!\" called John, \"and no time to lose.\"    At this the boys jumped up and all started for the barn.    \"There's smoke!\" exclaimed Harry in terror as they neared the barn.    \"The barn is afire!\" screamed John the next minute, almost falling from  his seat on the wagon in his haste to get down.    \"Quick! quick!\" yelled the boys, so frightened they could hardly move.    \"The hose!\" called John, seeing flames now shoot out of the barn  windows, \"Get the hose, Harry; it's in the coach house. I'll get a  bucket while you attach the hose.\"    By this time everybody was out from the house.    \"Oh, mercy!\" cried Aunt Sarah. \"Our whole barn will be burned.\"    Uncle Daniel was with John now, pouring water on the flames, that were  gaining in spite of all efforts to put them out.    \"Where's the firemen!\" cried little Freddie, in real tears this time,  for he, like all the others, was awfully frightened.    The boys had a stream from the hose now, but this too was of no  account, for the flames had shot up from the big pile of dry hay!    \"The firemen!\" called Freddie again.    \"There are no firemen in the country, Freddie,\" Nan told him. \"We have  to put the fire out ourselves.\"    \"We can't then,\" he went on, \"and all the other barns will burn too.\"    There was indeed great danger, for the flames were getting ahead  rapidly.    All this time the terrific thunderstorm was coming up.    Clap after clap of thunder rolled over the hills and made the fire look  more terrible against the black sky.    \"The rain!\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel at last, \"The rain may put it out;  we can't.\"    At this one terrific clap of thunder came. Then the downpour of rain.  It came like a very deluge, and as it fell on the flames it sent out  steam and smoke but quickly subdued the cracking and flashing of the  fire.    Everybody ran to the back porch now but John and Uncle Daniel. They  went in the coach house at the side of the barn.    \"How could it have caught fire?\" Aunt Sarah said. But Harry and Bert  were both very pale, and never said a word.    How heavily the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#14)"],[1,"les, established by the Compromise measures of  1850, to wit:    \"First, That all questions pertaining to Slavery in the Territories, and  the new States to be formed therefrom, are to be left to the decision of  the people residing therein through their appropriate representatives.    \"Second, That 'all cases involving title to slaves,' and 'questions of  personal freedom,' are referred to the adjudication of the local  tribunals with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United  States.    \"Third, That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United  States, in respect to fugitives from service, are to be carried into  faithful execution in all the `organized Territories,' the same as in  the States.\"    The sections authorizing Kansas and Nebraska to elect and send delegates  to Congress also prescribed:    \"That the Constitution, and all laws of the United States which are not  locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the  said Territory, as elsewhere in the United States, except the section of  the Act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union,  approved March 6th, 1820, which was superseded by the principles of the  Legislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures, and is  declared inoperative.\"    And when \"explaining this Kansas-Nebraska Bill\" Mr. Douglas announced  that, in reporting it, \"The object of the Committee was neither to  legislate Slavery in or out of the Territories; neither to introduce nor  exclude it; but to remove whatever obstacle Congress had put there, and  apply the doctrine of Congressional Non-intervention in accordance with  the principles of the Compromise Measures of 1850, and allow the people  to do as they pleased upon this as well as all other matters affecting  their interests.\"    A vigorous and able debate ensued.  A motion by Mr. Chase to strike out  the words \"which was superseded by the principles of the legislation of  1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures,\" was defeated decisively.  Subsequently Mr. Douglas moved to strike out the same words and insert  in place of them, these: \"which being inconsistent with the principles  of Non-intervention by Congress with Slavery in the States and  Territories, as recognized by the legislation of 1850 (commonly called  the Compromise Measures), is hereby declared inoperative and void; it  being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate Slavery  into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave  the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic  institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the  United States\"--and the motion was agreed to by a vote of 35 yeas to 10  nays.  Mr. Chase immediately moved to add to the amendment just adopted  these words: \"Under which, the people of the Territory, through their  appropriate representatives, may, if they see fit, prohibit the  existence of Slavery therein;\" but this motion was voted down by 36 nays  to 10 yeas.  This developed the rat in the meal-tub.  The people were to  be \"perfectly free\" to act either way on the subject of Slavery, so long  as they did not prohibit Slavery!  In this shape the Bill passed the  Senate.    Public sentiment in the North was greatly stirred by this direct attempt  to repeal the Missouri Compromise.  But by the superior parliamentary  tactics of Southern Representatives in the House, whereby the radical  friends of Freedom were shut out from the opportunity of amendment, a  House Bill essentially the same as the Senate Bill was subsequently  passed by the House, under the previous question, and afterward rapidly  passed the Senate, and was approved by the President.  At once commenced  that long and terrible struggle between the friends of Free-Soil and the  friends of Slavery, for the possession of Kansas, which convulsed the  whole Country for years, and moistened the soil of that Territory with  streams of blood, shed in numerous \"border-ruffian\" conflicts.    The Territorial Government of Kansas was organized late in 1854, and an  \"election\" for Delegate held, at which the Pro-Slavery candidate  (Whitfield) was fraudulently elected.  On March 30, 1855, a Territorial  Legislature was similarly chosen by Pro-Slavery voters \"colonized\" from  Missouri.  That Legislature, upon its meeting, proceeded at once to  enact most outrageous Pro-Slavery laws, which being vetoed by the  Free-Soil Governor (Reeder), were passed over the veto, and the Free-Soil  Governor had to give place to one who favored Slavery in Kansas.  But  the Free-Soil settlers of Kansas, in Mass Convention at Big Springs,  utterly repudiated the bogus Legislature and all its acts, to which they  refused submission.    In consequence of these radical differences, two separate elections for  Delegate in Congress were held by the opposing factions, at one of which  was elected the Pro-Slavery Whitfield, and at the other the Free-Soiler  Reeder.  Furthermore, under a call issued by the Big Springs Convention,  a Free-State Constitutional Convention was held in October, 1855, at  Topeka, which framed a Free-State Constitution, and asked admission  under it to the Union.    In 1856, the House of Representatives--which, after a protracted  struggle, had elected N. P. Banks Speaker--passed a Bill, by a bare  majority, admitting Kansas under her Topeka Constitution; but the Senate  defeated it.  July 4, 1856, by order of President Pierce, the Free-State  Legislature, chosen under the Topeka Constitution to meet at Topeka, was  dispersed by United States Troops.  Yet, despite all oppositions,  discouragements, and outrages, the Free-State population of  Kansas continued to increase from immigration.    In 1857, the Pro-Slavery Legislature elected by the Pro-Slavery voters  at their own special election--the Free-State voters declining to  participate--called a Constitutional Convention at Lecompton, which  formed a Pro-Slavery Constitution.  This was submitted to the people in  such dexterous manner that they could only vote \"For the Constitution  with Slavery\" or \"For the Constitution without Slavery\"--and, as the  Constitution prescribed that \"the rights of property in Slaves now in  the Territory, shall in no manner be interfered with,\" to vote \"for the  Constitution Without Slavery\" was an absurdity only paralleled by the  course of the United States Senate in refusing to permit the people of  Kansas \"to prohibit Slavery\" while at the same time declaring them  \"perfectly free to act\" as they chose in the matter.    The Constitution, with Slavery, was thus adopted by a vote of over  6,000.  But in the meanwhile, at another general election held for the  purpose, and despite all the frauds perpetrated by the Pro-Slavery men,  a Free-State Legislature, and Free-State Delegate to Congress had been  elected; and this Legislature submitted the Lecompton Pro-Slavery  Constitution to the people, January 4, 1858, so that they could vote:  \"For the Lecompton Constitution with Slavery,\" \"For the Lecompton  Constitution without Slavery,\" or \"Against the Lecompton Constitution.\"  The consequence was that the Lecompton Constitution was defeated by a  majority of over 10,000 votes--the Missouri Pro-Slavery colonists  declining to recognize the validity of any further election on the  subject.    Meanwhile, in part upon the issues growing out of this Kansas conflict,  the political parties of the Nation had passed through another  Presidential campaign (1856), in which the Democratic candidate Buchanan  had been elected over Fremont the \"Republican,\" and Fillmore the  \"American,\" candidates.  Both Houses of Congress being now Democratic,  Mr. Buchanan recommended them to accept and ratify the Lecompton  Pro-Slavery Constitution.    In March, 1858, the Senate passed a Bill--against the efforts of Stephen  A.  Douglas--accepting it.  In the House, however, a substitute offered  by Mr. Montgomery (Douglas Democrat) known as the Crittenden-Montgomery  Compromise, was adopted.  The Senate refused to concur, and the report  of a Committee of Conference--providing for submitting to the Kansas  people a proposition placing limitations upon certain public land  advantages stipulated for in the Lecompton Constitution, and in case  they rejected the proposition that another Constitutional Convention  should be held--was adopted by both Houses; and the proposition being  rejected by the people of Kansas, the Pro-Slavery Lecompton Constitution  fell with it.    In 1859 a Convention, called by the Territorial Legislature for the  purpose, met at Wyandot, and framed a Free State Constitution which was  adopted by the people in October of that year, and at the ensuing State  election in December the State went Republican.  In April, 1860, the  House of Representatives passed a Bill admitting Kansas as a State under  that Constitution, but the Democratic Senate adjourned without action on  the Bill; and it was not until early in 1861 that Kansas was at last  admitted.    In the meantime, the Free Trade Tariff of 1846 had produced the train of  business and financial disasters that its opponents predicted.  Instead  of prosperity everywhere in the land, there was misery and ruin.  Even  the discovery and working of the rich placer mines of California and the  consequent flow, in enormous volume, of her golden treasure into the  Eastern States, could not stay-the wide-spread flood of disaster.  President Fillmore, who had succeeded General Taylor on the latter's  death, frequently called the attention of Congress to the evils produced  by this Free Trade, and to the necessity of protecting our manufactures  \"from ruinous competition from abroad.\"  So also with his successor,  President Buchanan, who, in his Message of 1857, declared that \"In the  midst of unsurpassed plenty in all the productions and in all the  elements of national wealth, we find our manufactures"]]]
