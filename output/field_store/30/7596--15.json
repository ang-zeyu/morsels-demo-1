They are the descendants of  liberated slaves set free during the time of our occupation of the  island as a naval depot for suppressing the slave trade, and of  Sierra Leonians and Accras who have arrived and settled since then.  They have some of the same \"Black gennellum, Sar\" style about them,  but not developed to the same ridiculous extent as in the Sierra  Leonians, for they have not been under our institutions.  The \"Nanny  Po\" ladies are celebrated for their beauty all along the West Coast,  and very justly.  They are not however, as they themselves think,  the most beautiful women in this part of the world.  Not at least to  my way of thinking.  I prefer an Elmina, or an Igalwa, or a  M'pongwe, or--but I had better stop and own that my affections have  got very scattered among the black ladies on the West Coast, and I  no sooner remember one lovely creature whose soft eyes, perfect form  and winning, pretty ways have captivated me than I think of another.  The Nanny Po ladies have often a certain amount of Spanish blood in  them, which gives a decidedly greater delicacy to their features--  delicate little nostrils, mouths not too heavily lipped, a certain  gloss on the hair, and a light in the eye.  But it does not improve  their colour, and I am assured that it has an awful effect on their  tempers, so I think I will remain, for the present, the faithful  admirer of my sable Ingramina, the Igalwa, with the little red  blossoms stuck in her night-black hair, and a sweet soft look and  word for every one, but particularly for her ugly husband Isaac the  \"Jack Wash.\"        CHAPTER III.  VOYAGE DOWN COAST.        Wherein the voyager before leaving the Rivers discourses on dangers,  to which is added some account of Mangrove swamps and the creatures  that abide therein.    I left Calabar in May and joined the Benguela off Lagos Bar.  My  voyage down coast in her was a very pleasant one and full of  instruction, for Mr. Fothergill, who was her purser, had in former  years resided in Congo Francais as a merchant, and to Congo Francais  I was bound with an empty hold as regards local knowledge of the  district.  He was one of that class of men, of which you most  frequently find representatives among the merchants, who do not  possess the power so many men along here do possess (a power that  always amazes me), of living for a considerable time in a district  without taking any interest in it, keeping their whole attention  concentrated on the point of how long it will be before their time  comes to get out of it.  Mr. Fothergill evidently had much knowledge  and experience of the Fernan Vaz district and its natives.  He had,  I should say, overdone his experiences with the natives, as far as  personal comfort and pleasure at the time went, having been nearly  killed and considerably chivied by them.  Now I do not wish a man,  however much I may deplore his total lack of local knowledge, to go  so far as this.  Mr. Fothergill gave his accounts of these incidents  calmly, and in an undecorated way that gave them a power and  convincingness verging on being unpleasant, although useful, to a  person who was going into the district where they had occurred, for  one felt there was no mortal reason why one should not personally  get involved in similar affairs.  And I must here acknowledge the  great subsequent service Mr. Fothergill's wonderfully accurate  descriptions of the peculiar characteristics of the Ogowe forests  were to me when I subsequently came to deal with these forests on my  own account, as every district of forest has peculiar  characteristics of its own which you require to know.  I should like  here to speak of West Coast dangers because I fear you may think  that I am careless of, or do not believe in them, neither of which  is the case.  The more you know of the West Coast of Africa, the  more you realise its dangers.  For example, on your first voyage out  you hardly believe the stories of fever told by the old Coasters.  That is because you do not then understand the type of man who is  telling them, a man who goes to his death with a joke in his teeth.  But a short experience of your own, particularly if you happen on a  place having one of its periodic epidemics, soon demonstrates that  the underlying horror of the thing is there, a rotting corpse which  the old Coaster has dusted over with jokes to cover it so that it  hardly shows at a distance, but which, when you come yourself to  live alongside, you soon become cognisant of.  Many men, when they  have got ashore and settled, realise this, and let the horror get a  grip on them; a state briefly and locally described as funk, and a  state that usually ends fatally; and you can hardly blame them.  Why, I know of a case myself.  A young man who had never been  outside an English country town before in his life, from family  reverses had to take a situation as book-keeper down in the Bights.  The factory he was going to was in an isolated out-of-the-way place  and not in a settlement, and when the ship called off it, he was put  ashore in one of the ship's boats with his belongings, and a case or  so of goods.  There were only the firm's beach-boys down at the  surf, and as the steamer was in a hurry the officer from the ship  did not go up to the factory with him, but said good-bye and left  him alone with a set of naked savages as he thought, but really of  good kindly Kru boys on the beach.  He could not understand what  they said, nor they what he said, and so he walked up to the house  and on to the verandah and tried to find the Agent he had come out  to serve under.  He looked into the open-ended dining-room and shyly  round the verandah, and then sat down and waited for some one to  turn up.  Sundry natives turned up, and said a good deal, but no one  white or comprehensible, so in desperation he made another and a  bolder tour completely round the verandah and noticed a most  peculiar noise in one of the rooms and an infinity of flies going  into the venetian shuttered window.  Plucking up courage he went in  and found what was left of the white Agent, a considerable quantity  of rats, and most of the flies in West Africa.  He then presumably  had fever, and he was taken off, a fortnight afterwards, by a French  boat, to whom the natives signalled, and he is not coming down the  Coast again.  Some men would have died right out from a shock like  this.    But most of the new-comers do not get a shock of this order.  They  either die themselves or get more gradually accustomed to this sort  of thing, when they come to regard death and fever as soldiers, who  on a battle-field sit down, and laugh and talk round a camp fire  after a day's hard battle, in which they have seen their friends and  companions falling round them; all the time knowing that to-morrow  the battle comes again and that to-morrow night they themselves may  never see.    It is not hard-hearted callousness, it is only their way.  Michael  Scott put this well in Tom Cringle's Log, in his account of the  yellow fever during the war in the West Indies.  Fever, though the  chief danger, particularly to people who go out to settlements, is  not the only one; but as the other dangers, except perhaps domestic  poisoning, are incidental to pottering about in the forests, or on  the rivers, among the unsophisticated tribes, I will not dwell on  them.  They can all be avoided by any one with common sense, by  keeping well out of the districts in which they occur; and so I warn  the general reader that if he goes out to West Africa, it is not  because I said the place was safe, or its dangers overrated.  The  cemeteries of the West Coast are full of the victims of those people  who have said that Coast fever is \"Cork fever,\" and a man's own  fault, which it is not; and that natives will never attack you  unless you attack them:  which they will--on occasions.    My main aim in going to Congo Francais was to get up above the tide  line of the Ogowe River and there collect fishes; for my object on  this voyage was to collect fish from a river north of the Congo.  I  had hoped this river would have been the Niger, for Sir George  Goldie had placed at my disposal great facilities for carrying on  work there in comfort; but for certain private reasons I was  disinclined to go from the Royal Niger Protectorate into the Royal  Niger Company's territory; and the Calabar, where Sir Claude  MacDonald did everything he possibly could to assist me, I did not  find a good river for me to collect fishes in.  These two rivers  failing me, from no fault of either of their own presiding genii, my  only hope of doing anything now lay on the South West Coast river,  the Ogowe, and everything there depended on Mr. Hudson's attitude  towards scientific research in the domain of ichthyology.  Fortunately for me that gentleman elected to take a favourable view  of this affair, and in every way in his power assisted me during my  entire stay in Congo Francais.  But before I enter into a detailed  description of this wonderful bit of West Africa, I must give you a  brief notice of the manners, habits and customs of West Coast rivers  in general, to make the thing more intelligible.    There is an uniformity in the habits of West Coast rivers, from the  Volta to the Coanza, which is, when you get used to it, very taking.  Excepting the Congo, the really great river comes out to sea with as  much mystery as possible; lounging lazily along among its mangrove  swamps in a what's-it-matter-when-one-comes-out and where's-the-  hurry style, through quantities of channels inter-communicating with  each other.  Each channel, at first sight as like the other as peas  in a pod, is bordered on either side by green-black walls of  mangroves, which Captain Lugard graphically described as seeming \"as  if they had lost all count of the vegetable proprieties, and were  standing on stilts with their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#14)"],[1,"so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to  such as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that  if, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I  do not believe that I should have been able to succeed.
