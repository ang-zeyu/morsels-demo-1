With a nervous gesture, I shook him off, and crossed quickly  over to the left-hand wall. If anything were coming, I was going to have  the wall at my back.    Then, as I stared anxiously up the pathway, my candle caught a gleam,  far up the passage. At the same moment, I became conscious of a  murmurous roar, that grew louder, and filled the whole cavern with  deafening sound. From the Pit, came a deep, hollow echo, like the sob of  a giant. Then, I had sprung to one side, on to the narrow ledge that ran  'round the abyss, and, turning, saw a great wall of foam sweep past me,  and leap tumultuously into the waiting chasm. A cloud of spray burst  over me, extinguishing my candle, and wetting me to the skin. I still  held my gun. The three nearest candles went out; but the further ones  gave only a short flicker. After the first rush, the flow of water eased  down to a steady stream, maybe a foot in depth; though I could not see  this, until I had procured one of the lighted candles, and, with it,  started to reconnoiter. Pepper had, fortunately, followed me as I leapt  for the ledge, and now, very much subdued, kept close behind.    A short examination showed me that the water reached right across the  passage, and was running at a tremendous rate. Already, even as I stood  there, it had deepened. I could make only a guess at what had happened.  Evidently, the water in the ravine had broken into the passage, by some  means. If that were the case, it would go on increasing in volume, until  I should find it impossible to leave the place. The thought was  frightening. It was evident that I must make my exit as hurriedly  as possible.    Taking my gun by the stock, I sounded the water. It was a little under  knee-deep. The noise it made, plunging down into the Pit, was deafening.  Then, with a call to Pepper, I stepped out into the flood, using the gun  as a staff. Instantly, the water boiled up over my knees, and nearly to  the tops of my thighs, with the speed at which it was racing. For one  short moment, I nearly lost my footing; but the thought of what lay  behind, stimulated me to a fierce endeavor, and, step-by-step, I  made headway.    Of Pepper, I knew nothing at first. I had all I could do to keep on my  legs; and was overjoyed, when he appeared beside me. He was wading  manfully along. He is a big dog, with longish thin legs, and I suppose  the water had less grasp on them, than upon mine. Anyway, he managed a  great deal better than I did; going ahead of me, like a guide, and  wittingly--or otherwise--helping, somewhat, to break the force of the  water. On we went, step by step, struggling and gasping, until somewhere  about a hundred yards had been safely traversed. Then, whether it was  because I was taking less care, or that there was a slippery place on  the rocky floor, I cannot say; but, suddenly, I slipped, and fell on my  face. Instantly, the water leapt over me in a cataract, hurling me down,  toward that bottomless hole, at a frightful speed. Frantically I  struggled; but it was impossible to get a footing. I was helpless,  gasping and drowning. All at once, something gripped my coat, and  brought me to a standstill. It was Pepper. Missing me, he must have  raced back, through the dark turmoil, to find me, and then caught, and  held me, until I was able to get to my feet.    I have a dim recollection of having seen, momentarily, the gleams of  several lights; but, of this, I have never been quite sure. If my  impressions are correct, I must have been washed down to the very brink  of that awful chasm, before Pepper managed to bring me to a standstill.  And the lights, of course, could only have been the distant flames of  the candles, I had left burning. But, as I have said, I am not by any  means sure. My eyes were full of water, and I had been badly shaken.    And there was I, without my helpful gun, without light, and sadly  confused, with the water deepening; depending solely upon my old friend  Pepper, to help me out of that hellish place.    I was facing the torrent. Naturally, it was the only way in which I  could have sustained my position a moment; for even old Pepper could not  have held me long against that terrific strain, without assistance,  however blind, from me.    Perhaps a minute passed, during which it was touch and go with me;  then, gradually I re-commenced my tortuous way up the passage. And so  began the grimmest fight with death, from which ever I hope to emerge  victorious. Slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, I strove; and that  faithful Pepper led me, dragged me, upward and onward, until, at last,  ahead I saw a gleam of blessed light. It was the entrance. Only a few  yards further, and I reached the opening, with the water surging and  boiling hungrily around my loins.    And now I understood the cause of the catastrophe. It was raining  heavily, literally in torrents. The surface of the lake was level with  the bottom of the opening--nay! more than level, it was above it.  Evidently, the rain had swollen the lake, and caused this premature  rise; for, at the rate the ravine had been filling, it would not have  reached the entrance for a couple more days.    Luckily, the rope by which I had descended, was streaming into the  opening, upon the inrushing waters. Seizing the end, I knotted it  securely 'round Pepper's body, then, summoning up the last remnant of my  strength, I commenced to swarm up the side of the cliff. I reached the  Pit edge, in the last stage of exhaustion. Yet, I had to make one more  effort, and haul Pepper into safety.    Slowly and wearily, I hauled on the rope. Once or twice, it seemed that  I should have to give up; for Pepper is a weighty dog, and I was utterly  done. Yet, to let go, would have meant certain death to the old fellow,  and the thought spurred me to greater exertions. I have but a very hazy  remembrance of the end. I recall pulling, through moments that lagged  strangely. I have also some recollection of seeing Pepper's muzzle,  appearing over the Pit edge, after what seemed an indefinite period of  time. Then, all grew suddenly dark.        _XIII_    THE TRAP IN THE GREAT CELLAR    I suppose I must have swooned; for, the next thing I remember, I opened  my eyes, and all was dusk. I was lying on my back, with one leg doubled  under the other, and Pepper was licking my ears. I felt horribly stiff,  and my leg was numb, from the knee, downward. For a few minutes, I lay  thus, in a dazed condition; then, slowly, I struggled to a sitting  position, and looked about me.    It had stopped raining, but the trees still dripped, dismally. From the  Pit, came a continuous murmur of running water. I felt cold and shivery.  My clothes were sodden, and I ached all over. Very slowly, the life came  back into my numbed leg, and, after a little, I essayed to stand up.  This, I managed, at the second attempt; but I was very tottery, and  peculiarly weak. It seemed to me, that I was going to be ill, and I made  shift to stumble my way toward the house. My steps were erratic, and my  head confused. At each step that I took, sharp pains shot through  my limbs.    I had gone, perhaps, some thirty paces, when a cry from Pepper, drew  my attention, and I turned, stiffly, toward him. The old dog was trying  to follow me; but could come no further, owing to the rope, with which I  had hauled him up, being still tied 'round his body, the other end not  having been unfastened from the tree. For a moment, I fumbled with the  knots, weakly; but they were wet and hard, and I could do nothing. Then,  I remembered my knife, and, in a minute, the rope was cut.    How I reached the house, I scarcely know, and, of the days that  followed, I remember still less. Of one thing, I am certain, that, had  it not been for my sister's untiring love and nursing, I had not been  writing at this moment.    When I recovered my senses, it was to find that I had been in bed for  nearly two weeks. Yet another week passed, before I was strong enough to  totter out into the gardens. Even then, I was not able to walk so far as  the Pit. I would have liked to ask my sister, how high the water had  risen; but felt it was wiser not to mention the subject to her. Indeed,  since then, I have made a rule never to speak to her about the strange  things, that happen in this great, old house.    It was not until a couple of days later, that I managed to get across  to the Pit. There, I found that, in my few weeks' absence, there had  been wrought a wondrous change. Instead of the three-parts filled  ravine, I looked out upon a great lake, whose placid surface, reflected  the light, coldly. The water had risen to within half a dozen feet of  the Pit edge. Only in one part was the lake disturbed, and that was  above the place where, far down under the silent waters, yawned the  entrance to the vast, underground Pit. Here, there was a continuous  bubbling; and, occasionally, a curious sort of sobbing gurgle would find  its way up from the depth. Beyond these, there was nothing to tell of  the things that were hidden beneath. As I stood there, it came to me  how wonderfully things had worked out. The entrance to the place whence  the Swine-creatures had come, was sealed up, by a power that made me  feel there was nothing more to fear from them. And yet, with the  feeling, there was a sensation that, now, I should never learn anything  further, of the place from which those dreadful Things had come. It was  completely shut off and concealed from human curiosity forever.    Strange--in the knowledge of that underground hell-hole--how apposite  has been the naming of the Pit. One wonders how it originated, and when.  Naturally, one concludes that the shape and depth of the ravine would  suggest the name 'Pit.' Yet, is it not possible that it has, all along,  held a deeper significance, a hint--could one but have guessed--of the  greater, more stupendous Pit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10023"],[0,"There's Pippins and Cheese to Come (#15)"],[1,"a  paper of tombstone inscriptions, with a note of direction how others might  be found in a neighboring churchyard if I were curious. A lady in whose  company I camped last summer has asked me to give a chapter to it. We were  abroad upon a lake in the full moon--we were lost upon a mountain--twice a  canoe upset--there were the usual jests about cooking. These things might  have filled a few pages agreeably, yet so far they have given me only a  paragraph.    But I am not disposed toward any of these subjects, least of all the cat,  upon which I look--despite the coldness of her nature--as a harmless and  comforting appendage of the hearth-rug. I would no more prey upon her  morals than I would the morals of the andirons. I choose, rather, to slip  to another angle of the question and say a few words about cowards, among  whom I have already confessed that I number myself.    In this year of battles, when physical courage sits so high, the reader--if  he is swept off in the general opinion--will expect under such a title  something caustic. He will think that I am about to loose against all  cowards a plague of frogs and locusts as if old Egypt had come again. But  cowardice is its own punishment. It needs no frog to nip it. Even the  sharp-toothed locust--for in the days that bordered so close upon the  mastodon, the locust could hardly have fallen to the tender greenling we  know today--even the locust that once spoiled the Egyptians could not now  add to the grief of a coward.    And yet--really I hesitate. I blush. My attack will be too intimate; for I  have confessed that I am not the very button on the cap of bravery. I have  indeed stiffened myself to ride a horse, a mightier feat than driving him  because of the tallness of the monster and his uneasy movement, as though  his legs were not well socketed and might fall out on a change of gaits. I  have ridden on a camel in a side-show, but have found my only comfort in  his hump. I have stroked the elephant. In a solemn hour of night I have  gone downstairs to face a burglar. But I do not run singing to these  dangers. While your really brave fellow is climbing a dizzy staircase to  the moon--I write in figure--I would shake with fear upon a lower platform.    Perhaps you recall Mr. Tipp of the Elia essays. \"Tipp,\" says his pleasant  biographer, \"never mounted the box of a stage-coach in his life; or leaned  against the rails of a balcony; or walked upon the ridge of a parapet; or  looked down a precipice; or let off a gun.\" I cannot follow Tipp, it may  be, to his extreme tremors--my hair will not rise to so close a likeness of  the fretful porcupine--yet in a measure we are in agreement. We are, as it  were, cousins, with the mark of our common family strong on both of us.    There are persons who, when in your company on a country walk, will steal  apples, not with a decent caution from a tree along the fence, but far  afield. If there are grapes, they will not wait for a turn of the road,  but will pluck them in the open. Or maybe in your wandering you come on a  half-built house. You climb in through a window to look about. Here the  stairs will go. The ice-box will be set against this wall. But if your  companion is one of valor's minions, he will not be satisfied with this  safe and agreeable research--this mild speculation on bath-rooms--this  innocent placing of a stove. He must go aloft. He has seen a ladder and  yearns to climb it. The footing on the second story is bad enough. If you  fall between the joists, you will clatter to the basement. It is hard to  realize that such an open breezy place will ever be cosy and warm with  fires, and that sleepy folk will here lie snugly a-bed on frosty mornings.  But still the brazen fellow is not content. A ladder leads horribly to the  roof. For myself I will climb until the tip of my nose juts out upon the  world--until it sprouts forth to the air from the topmost timbers: But I  will go no farther. But if your companion sees a scaffold around a chimney,  he must perch on it. For him, a dizzy plank is a pleasant belvedere from  which to view the world.    The bravery of this kind of person is not confined to these few matters.  If you happen to go driving with him, he will--if the horse is of the kind  that distends his nostrils--on a sudden toss you the reins and leave you to  guard him while he dispatches an errand. If it were a motor car there would  be a brake to hold it. If it were a boat, you might throw out an anchor. A  butcher's cart would have a metal drag. But here you sit defenseless--tied  to the whim of a horse--greased for a runaway. The beast Dobbin turns his  head and holds you with his hard eye. There is a convulsive movement along  his back, a preface, it may be, to a sudden seizure. A real friend would  have loosed the straps that run along the horse's flanks. Then, if any  deviltry take him, he might go off alone and have it out.    I have in mind a livery stable in Kalamazoo. Myself and another man of  equal equestrianism were sent once to bring out a thing called a surrey and  a pair of horses. Do you happen to be acquainted with Blat's Horse Food? If  your way lies among the smaller towns, you must know its merits. They are  proclaimed along the fences and up the telegraph poles. Drinking-troughs  speak its virtues. Horses thrive on Blat's Food. They neigh for it. A  flashing lithograph is set by way of testament wherever traffic turns or  lingers. Do you not recall the picture? A great red horse rears himself  on his hind legs. His forward hoofs are extended. He is about to trample  someone under foot. His nostrils are wide. He is unduly excited. It cannot  be food, it must be drink that stirs him. He is a fearful spectacle.    There was such a picture on the wall of the stable.    \"Have you any horses,\" I asked nervously, jerking my thumb toward the wall,  \"any horses that have been fed on just ordinary food? Some that are a  little tired?\"    For I remembered how Mr. Winkle once engaged horses to take the  Pickwickians out to Manor Farm and what mishaps befell them on the way.    \"'He don't shy, does he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.    \"'Shy, sir?--He wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vagginload of monkeys with  their tails burnt off.'\"    But how Mr. Pickwick dropped his whip, how Mr. Winkle got off his tall  horse to pick it up, how he tried in vain to remount while his horse went  round and round, how they were all spilt out upon the bridge and how  finally they walked to Manor Farm--these things are known to everybody with  an inch of reading.    \"'How far is it to Dingley Dell?' they asked.    \"'Better er seven mile.'    \"'Is it a good road?'    \"'No, t'ant.'...    \"The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall quadruped,  for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust, following slowly at  their heels.\"    \"Have you any horses,\" I repeated, \"that have not been fed on Blat's  Food--horses that are, so to speak, on a diet?\"    In the farthest stalls, hidden from the sunlight and the invigorating  infection of the day, two beasts were found with sunken chests and hollow  eyes, who took us safely to our destination on their hands and knees.    As you may suspect, I do not enjoy riding. There is, it is true, one saddle  horse in North Carolina that fears me. If time still spares him, that horse  I could ride with content. But I would rather trust myself on the top of a  wobbly step-ladder than up the sides of most horses. I am not quite of a  mind, however, with Samuel Richardson who owned a hobby-horse and rode on  his hearth-rug in the intervals of writing \"Pamela.\" It is likely that when  he had rescued her from an adventure of more than usual danger--perhaps her  villainous master has been concealed in her closet--perhaps he has been  hiding beneath her bed--it is likely, having brought her safely off, the  author locked her in the buttery against a fresh attack. Then he felt, good  man, in need of exercise. So while he waits for tea and muffins, he leaps  upon his rocking-horse and prances off. As for the hobby-horse itself, I  have not heard whether it was of the usual nursery type, or whether it was  built in the likeness of the leather camels of a German steamship.    I need hardly say that these confessions of my cowardice are for your ear  alone. They must not get abroad to smirch me. If on a country walk I have  taken to my heels, you must not twit me with poltroonery. If you charge me  with such faint-heartedness while other persons are present, I'll deny it  flat. When I sit in the company of ladies at dinner, I dissemble my true  nature, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat.  If then, you taunt me, for want of a better escape, I shall turn it to a  jest. I shall engage the table flippantly: Hear how preposterously the  fellow talks!--he jests to satisfy a grudge. In appearance I am whole as  the marble, founded as a rock.    But really some of us cowards are diverting persons. The lady who directed  me against the cow is a most delightful woman with whom I hope I shall  again sit at dinner. A witty lady of my acquaintance shivers when a  cat walks in the room. A man with whom I pass the time pleasantly and  profitably, although he will not admit a fear of ghosts, still will not  sleep in an empty house because of possible noises. I would rather spend a  Saturday evening in the company of the cowardly Falstaff than of the bold  Hotspur. If it were not for sack, villainous sack, and a few spots upon his  front, you would go far to find a better companion than the fat old Knight.  Bob Acres was not much for valor and he made an ass of himself when he went  to fight a duel, yet one could have sat agreeably at mutton with him.    But these things are slight. It matters little whether or not one can mount  a ladder comfortably. Now that motors have come in, horses stand remotely  in our lives. Nor is it of"]]]
