I am  told that since he has been sentenced to death he has become a changed  character. That I don't believe. The place to which the wicked go is not  bad enough for him. I think its occupants, bad as they might be, are too  good to be where he is. No matter where he goes, I am satisfied that  there will be hell. Not even a Shakespeare could adequately paint such a  man as he has been. My lifelong regret will be that I ever knew him.\"    With these few earnest words Mrs. Dyson quitted the shores of England,  hardly clearing up the mystery of her actual relations with Peace.    A woman with whom Mrs. Dyson very much resented finding herself  classed--inebriety would appear to have been their only common  weakness--was Mrs. Thompson, the \"traitress Sue.\" In spite of the fact  that on February 5 Mrs. Thompson had applied to the Treasury for L100,  blood money due her for assisting the police in the identification of  Peace, she was at the same time carrying on a friendly correspondence  with her lover and making attempts to see him. Peace had written to her  before his trial hoping she would not forsake him; \"you have been my  bosom friend, and you have ofttimes said you loved me, that you would  die for me.\" He asked her to sell some goods which he had left with  her in order to raise money for his defence. The traitress replied on  January 27 that she had already sold everything and shared the proceeds  with Mrs. Peace. \"You are doing me great injustice,\" she wrote, \"by  saying that I have been out to 'work' with you. Do not die with such a  base falsehood on your conscience, for you know I am young and have my  living and character to redeem. I pity you and myself to think we should  have met.\" After his condemnation Mrs. Thompson made repeated efforts  to see Peace, coming to Leeds for the purpose. Peace wrote a letter on  February 9 to his \"poor Sue,\" asking her to come to the prison. But,  partly at the wish of Peace's relatives and for reasons of their own, a  permission given Mrs. Thompson by the authorities to visit the convict  was suddenly withdrawn, and she never saw him again.        III    HIS TRIAL AND EXECUTION      In the lives of those famous men who have perished on the scaffold  their behaviour during the interval between their condemnation and their  execution has always been the subject of curiosity and interest.    It may be said at once that nothing could have been more deeply  religious, more sincerely repentant, more Christian to all appearances  than Peace's conduct and demeanour in the last weeks of his life. He  threw himself into the work of atonement with the same uncompromising  zeal and energy that he had displayed as a burglar. By his death a truly  welcome and effective recruit was lost to the ranks of the contrite  and converted sinners. However powerless as a controlling force--and he  admitted it--his belief in God and the devil may have been in the past,  that belief was assured and confident, and in the presence of death  proclaimed itself with vigour, not in words merely, but in deeds.    In obedience to the wishes of his family, Peace had refrained from  seeing Sue Thompson. This was at some sacrifice, for he wished very much  to see her and to the last, though he knew that she had betrayed him,  sent her affectionate and forgiving messages. These were transmitted  to Sue by Mr. Brion. This disingenuous gentleman was a fellow-applicant  with Sue to the Treasury for pecuniary recognition of his efforts in  bringing about the identification of Peace, and furnishing the police  with information as to the convict's disposal of his stolen property. In  his zeal he had even gone so far as to play the role of an accomplice of  Peace, and by this means discovered a place in Petticoat Lane where the  burglar got rid of some of his booty.    After Peace's condemnation Mr. Brion visited him in Armley Jail. His  purpose in doing so was to wring from his co-inventor an admission that  the inventions which they had patented together were his work alone.  Peace denied this, but offered to sell his share for L50. Brion refused  the offer, and persisted in his assertion that Peace had got his name  attached to the patents by undue influence, whatever that might mean.  Peace, after wrestling with the spirit, gave way. \"Very well, my  friend,\" he said, \"let it be as you say. I have not cheated you, Heaven  knows. But I also know that this infamy of mine has been the cause of  bringing harm to you, which is the last thing I should have wished to  have caused to my friend.\" A deed of gift was drawn up, making over to  Brion Peace's share in their inventions; this Peace handed to Brion  as the price of the latter's precious forgiveness and a token of the  sincerity of his colleague's repentance. Thus, as has often happened  in this sad world, was disreputable genius exploited once again by  smug mediocrity. Mr. Brion, having got all he wanted, left the prison,  assuring the Governor that Peace's repentance was \"all bunkum,\" and  advising, with commendable anxiety for the public good, that the warders  in the condemned cell should be doubled.    Peace had one act of atonement to discharge more urgent than displaying  Christian forbearance towards ignoble associates. That was the righting  of William Habron, who was now serving the third year of his life  sentence for the murder of Constable Cock at Whalley Range. Peace  sent for the Governor of the jail a few days before his execution and  obtained from him the materials necessary for drawing up a plan. Peace  was quite an adept at making plans; he had already made an excellent one  of the scene of Dyson's murder. He now drew a plan of the place where  Cock had been shot, gave a detailed account of how he came by his death,  and made a full confession of his own guilt.    In the confession he described how, some days before the burglary, he  had, according to his custom, \"spotted\" the house at Whalley Range. In  order to do this he always dressed himself respectably, because he had  found that the police never suspected anyone who wore good clothes. On  the night of the crime he passed two policemen on the road to the house.  He had gone into the grounds and was about to begin operations when he  heard a rustle behind him and saw a policeman, whom he recognised as one  of those he had met in the road, enter the garden. With his well-known  agility Peace climbed on to the wall, and dropped on to the other side,  only to find himself almost in the arms of the second policeman. Peace  warned the officer to stand back and fired his revolver wide of him.  But, as Peace said, \"these Manchester policemen are a very obstinate  lot.\" The constable took out his truncheon. Peace fired again and killed  him.    Soon after the murderer saw in the newspapers that two men had been  arrested for the crime. \"This greatly interested me,\" said Peace. \"I  always had a liking to be present at trials, as the public no doubt know  by this time.\" So he went to Manchester Assizes and saw William Habron  sentenced to death. \"People will say,\" he said, \"that I was a hardened  wretch for allowing an innocent man to suffer for the crime of which  I was guilty but what man would have given himself up under such  circumstances, knowing as I did that I should certainly be hanged?\"  Peace's view of the question was a purely practical one: \"Now that I  am going to forfeit my own life and feel that I have nothing to gain  by further secrecy, I think it is right in the sight of God and man to  clear this innocent young man.\" It would have been more right in the  sight of God and man to have done it before, but then Peace admitted  that during all his career he had allowed neither God nor man to  influence his actions.    How many men in the situation of Peace at the time, with the certainty  of death before him if he confessed, would have sacrificed themselves to  save an innocent man? Cold-blooded heroism of this kind is rare in the  annals of crime. Nor did Peace claim to have anything of the hero about  him.         \"Lion-hearted I've lived,       And when my time comes       Lion-hearted I'll die.\"    Though fond of repeating this piece of doggerel, Peace would have  been the last man to have attributed to himself all those qualities  associated symbolically with the lion.    A few days before his execution Peace was visited in his prison by Mr.  Littlewood, the Vicar of Darnall. Mr. Littlewood had known Peace a few  years before, when he had been chaplain at Wakefield Prison. \"Well, my  old friend Peace,\" he said as he entered the cell, \"how are you to-day?\"  \"'I am very poorly, sir,\" replied the convict, \"but I am exceedingly  pleased to see you.\" Mr. Littlewood assured Peace that there was at any  rate one person in the world who had deep sympathy with him, and that  was himself. Peace burst into tears. He expressed a wish to unburden  himself to the vicar, but before doing so, asked for his assurance that  he believed in the truth and sincerity of what he was about to say to  him. He said that he preferred to be hanged to lingering out his life  in penal servitude, that he was grieved and repentant for his past  life. \"If I could undo, or make amends for anything I have done, I would  suffer my body as I now stand to be cut in pieces inch by inch. I feel,  sir, that I am too bad to live or die, and having this feeling I cannot  think that either you or anyone else would believe me, and that is the  reason why I ask you so much to try to be assured that you do not think  I am telling lies. I call my God to witness that all I am saying and  wish to say shall be the truth--the whole truth--nothing but the truth.\"  Mr. Littlewood said that, after carefully watching Peace and having  regard to his experience of some of the most hardened of criminals  during his service in Wakefield Prison, he felt convinced that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#14)"],[1,"here:--    ``Neither exaggerated self-love nor dogmatic reasoning is  rare in the human species.  In all countries these two roots of  the Jacobin spirit subsist, secret and indestructible. . . .  At  twenty years of age, when a young man is entering into the world,  his reason is stimulated simultaneously with his pride. In the  first place, whatever society he may move in, it is contemptible  to pure reason, for it has not been constructed by a philosophic  legislator according to a principle, but successive generations  have arranged it according to their multiple and ever-changing  needs.  It is not the work of logic, but of history, and the  young reasoner shrugs his shoulders at the sight of this old  building, whose site is arbitrary, whose architecture is  incoherent, and whose inconveniences are obvious. . . .  The  majority of young people, above all those who have their way to  make, are more or less Jacobin on leaving college. . . .  Jacobinism is born of social decomposition just as mushrooms are  born of a fermenting soil.  Consider the authentic monuments of  its thought--the speeches of Robespierre and Saint-Just, the  debates of the Legislative Assembly and the Convention, the  harangues, addresses, and reports of Girondists and Montagnards.  Never did men speak so much to say so little; the empty verbiage  and swollen emphasis swamp any truth there may be beneath their  monotony and their turgidity.  The Jacobin is full of respect for  the phantoms of his reasoning brain; in his eyes they are more  real than living men, and their suffrage is the only suffrage he  recognises--he will march onward in all sincerity at the head of  a procession of imaginary followers.  The millions of  metaphysical wills which he has created in the image of his own  will sustain him by their unanimous assent, and he will  project outwards, like a chorus of triumph and acclamation, the  inward echo of his own voice.''    While admiring Taine's description, I think he has not exactly  grasped the psychology of the Jacobin.    The mind of the true Jacobin, at the time of the Revolution as  now, was composed of elements which we must analyse if we are to  understand its function.    This analysis will show in the first place that the Jacobin is  not a rationalist, but a believer.  Far from building his belief  on reason, he moulds reason to his belief, and although his  speeches are steeped in rationalism he employs it very little in  his thoughts and his conduct.    A Jacobin who reasoned as much as he is accused of reasoning  would be sometimes accessible to the voice of reason.  Now,  observation proves, from the time of the Revolution to our own  days, that the Jacobin is never influenced by reasoning, however  just, and it is precisely here that his strength resides.    And why is he not accessible to reason?  Simply because his  vision of things, always extremely limited, does not permit of  his resisting the powerful and passionate impulses which guide  him.    These two elements, feeble reason and strong passions, would not  of themselves constitute the Jacobin mind.  There is another.    Passion supports convictions, but hardly ever creates them.  Now,  the true Jacobin has forcible convictions.  What is to sustain  them?  Here the mystic elements whose action we have already  studied come into play.  The Jacobin is a mystic who has  replaced the old divinities by new gods.  Imbued with the power  of words and formulae, he attributes to these a mysterious  power.  To serve these exigent divinities he does not shrink from  the most violent measures.  The laws voted by our modern Jacobins  furnish a proof of this fact.    The Jacobin mentality is found especially in narrow and  passionate characters.  It implies, in fact, a narrow and rigid  mind, inaccessible to all criticism and to all considerations but  those of faith.    The mystic and affective elements which dominate the mind of the  Jacobin condemn him to an extreme simplicity.  Grasping only the  superficial relations of things, nothing prevents him from taking  for realities the chimerical images which are born of his  imagination.  The sequence of phenomena and their results escape  him.  He never raises his eyes from his dream.    As we may see, it is not by the development of his logical reason  that the Jacobin exceeds.  He possesses very little logic of this  kind, and therefore he often becomes dangerous.  Where a superior  man would hesitate or halt the Jacobin, who has placed his feeble  reason at the service of his impulses, goes forward with  certainty.    So that although the Jacobin is a great reasoner, this does not  mean that he is in the least guided by reason.  When he imagines  he is being led by reason it is really his passions and his  mysticism that lead him.  Like all those who are convinced and  hemmed in by the walls of faith, he can never escape therefrom.    A true aggressive theologian, he is astonishingly like the  disciples of Calvin described in a previous chapter.  Hypnotised  by their faith, nothing could deter them from their object.  All  those who contradicted their articles of faith were considered  worthy of death.  They too seemed to be powerful reasoners.  Ignorant, like the Jacobins, of the secret forces that led them,  they believed that reason was their sole guide, while in reality  they were the slaves of mysticism and passion.    The truly rationalistic Jacobin would be incomprehensible, and  would merely make reason despair.  The passionate and mystical  Jacobin is, on the contrary, easily intelligible.    With these three elements--a very weak reasoning power, very  strong passions, and an intense mysticism--we have the true  psychological components of the mind of the Jacobin.        CHAPTER III    THE REVOLUTIONARY AND CRIMINAL MENTALITIES    1.  The Revolutionary Mentality.    We have just seen that the mystic elements are one of the  components of the Jacobin mentality.  We shall now see that they  enter into another form of mentality which is also clearly  defined, the revolutionary mentality.    In all ages societies have contained a certain number of restless  spirits, unstable and discontented, ready to rebel against any  established order of affairs.  They are actuated by the mere love  of revolt, and if some magic power could realise all their  desires they would simply revolt again.    This special mentality often results from a faulty adaptation of  the individual to his surroundings, or from an excess of  mysticism, but it may also be merely a question of temperament or  arise from pathological disturbances.    The need of revolt presents very different degrees of intensity,  from simple discontent expressed in words directed against men  and things to the need of destroying them.  Sometimes the  individual turns upon himself the revolutionary frenzy that he  cannot otherwise exercise.  Russia is full of these madmen,  who, not content with committing arson or throwing bombs at  hazard into the crowd, finally mutilate themselves, like the  Skopzis and other analogous sects.    These perpetual rebels are generally highly suggestible beings,  whose mystic mentality is obsessed by fixed ideas.  Despite the  apparent energy indicated by their actions they are really weak  characters, and are incapable of mastering themselves  sufficiently to resist the impulses that rule them.  The mystic  spirit which animates them furnishes pretexts for their violence,  and enables them to regard themselves as great reformers.    In normal times the rebels which every society contains are  restrained by the laws, by their environment--in short, by all  the usual social constraints, and therefore remain undetected.  But as soon as a time of disturbance begins these constraints  grow weaker, and the rebel can give a free reign to his  instincts.  He then becomes the accredited leader of a movement.  The motive of the revolution matters little to him; he will give  his life indifferently for the red flag or the white, or for the  liberation of a country which he has heard vaguely mentioned.    The revolutionary spirit is not always pushed to the extremes  which render it dangerous.  When, instead of deriving from  affective or mystic impulses, it has an intellectual origin, it  may become a source of progress.  It is thanks to those spirits  who are sufficiently independent to be intellectually  revolutionary that a civilisation is able to escape from the yoke  of tradition and habit when this becomes too heavy.  The  sciences, arts, and industries especially have progressed by  the aid of such men.  Galileo, Lavoisier, Darwin, and Pasteur  were such revolutionaries.    Although it is not necessary that a nation should possess any  large number of such spirits, it is very necessary that it should  possess some.  Without them men would still be living in caves.    The revolutionary audacity which results in discoveries implies  very rare faculties.  It necessitates notably an independence of  mind sufficient to escape from the influence of current opinions,  and a judgement that can grasp, under superficial analogies, the  hidden realities.  This form of revolutionary spirit is creative,  while that examined above is destructive.    The revolutionary mentality may, therefore, be compared to  certain physiological states in the life of the individual which  are normally useful, but which, when exaggerated, take a  pathological form which is always hurtful.      2.  The Criminal Mentality.      All the civilised societies inevitably drag behind them a residue  of degenerates, of the unadapted, of persons affected by various  taints.  Vagabonds, beggars, fugitives from justice, thieves,  assassins, and starving creatures that live from day to day, may  constitute the criminal population of the great cities.  In  ordinary times these waste products of civilisation are more or  less restrained by the police."]]]
