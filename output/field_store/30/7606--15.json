My poor child,' said she, 'they have  used you scandalous, ridiculous,' and she held down her nasty oily  shiny face and kissed me, till she nearly smothered me. Oh, Doctor, I  shall never forget that scene the longest day I ever live. She might a  been Rose by name, but she warn't one by nature, I tell you. When  niggers get their dander raised, and their ebenezer fairly up, they  ain't otter of roses, that's a fact; whatever Mrs Stowe may say. Oh, I  kicked and yelled and coughed like anything.    \"'Poor dear boy,' she said, 'Rosy ain't a goin' to hurt her own brave  child,' not she, and she kissed me again and again, till I thought I  should have fainted. She actually took away my breath.    \"'Come,' said she, and she set me down on my feet. 'Come to the house,  till I put some dry clothes on you, and I'll make some lasses candy  for you with my own hands!' But as soon as I touched land, I streaked  off for home, as hard as I could lay legs to the ground; but the  perfume of old Rose set me a sneezing so, I fairly blew up the dust in  the road as I went, as if a bull had been pawin of it, and left a  great wet streak behind me as if a watering-pot had passed that way.  Who should I meet when I returned, but mother a standin at the door.    \"'Why, Sam,' said she, 'what under the sun is the matter? What a spot  of work? Where in the world have you been?'    \"'In the mill pond,' said I.    \"'In the mill pond,' said she, slowly; 'and ruinated that beautiful  new coat I made out of your father's old one, and turned so nicely for  you. You are more trouble to me than all the rest of the boys put  together. Go right off to your room this blessed instant minite, and  go to bed and say your prayers, and render thanks for savin' your  clothes, if you did lose your life.'    \"'I wish I had lost my life,' said I.    \"'Wish you had lost your life?' said she. 'Why you miserable,  onsarcumsised, onjustified, graceless boy. Why do you wish you had  lost your life?'    \"'Phew, phew,' said I, 'was you ever kissed by a nigger? because if  you was, I guess you wouldn't have asked that are question,' and I  sneezed so hard I actually blew down the wire cage, the door of it  flew open, and the cat made a spring like wink and killed the canary  bird.    \"'Sam, Sam,' said she ('skat, skat, you nasty devil, you--you have got  the knary, I do declare.) Sam! Sam! to think I should have lived to  hear you ask your mother if she had ever been kissed by a nigger!' and  she began to boohoo right out. 'I do believe in my soul you are drunk,  Sam,' said she.    \"'I shouldn't wonder if I was,' said I, 'for I have drunk enough  to-day to serve a cow and a calf for a week.'    \"'Go right off to bed; my poor dear bird,' said she. 'And when your  father comes in I will send him to your cage. You shall be punished  for this.'    \"'I don't care,' sais I, for I was desperate and didn't mind what  happened, 'who you send, providin' you don't send black Rose, the  nigger wench, to me.'    \"Well, in about an hour or so I heard father come to the foot of the  stairs and call out 'Sam.' I didn't answer at first, but went and  threw the winder open ready for a jump.    \"Thinks I, 'Sam, you are in great luck to-day. 1st. You got nearly  drowned, savin' that little brat Zeb Snell. 2nd. You lost a bran new  hat, and spoilt your go-to-meetin' clothes. 3rd. Mrs Snell boxed your  ears till your eyes shot stars, like rockets. 4th. You got an  all-fired licking from old Colonel Jephunny, till he made a mulatto of  you, and you was half black and half white. 5th. You got kissed and  pysoned by that great big emancipated she-nigger wench. 6th. You have  killed your mother's canary bird, and she has jawed you till she went  into hysterics. 7th. Here's the old man a goin' to give you another  walloping and all for nothin. I'll cut and run, and dot drot me if I  don't, for it's tarnation all over.'    \"'Sam,' sais father again, a raisin' of his voice.    \"'Father,' sais I, 'I beg your pardon, I am very sorry for what I have  done, and I think I have been punished enough. If you will promise to  let me off this time, I will take my oath I will never save another  person from drowning again, the longest day I ever live.'    \"'Come down,' said he, 'when I tell you, I am goin' to reward you.'    \"'Thank you,' sais I, 'I have been rewarded already more than I  deserve.'    \"Well, to make a long story short, we concluded a treaty of peace, and  down I went, and there was Colonel Snell, who said he had drove over  to beg my pardon for the wrong he had done to me, and said he, 'Sam,  come to me at ten o'clock on Monday, and I will put you in a way to  make your fortune, as a recompense for saving my child's life.'    \"Well, I kept the appointment, tho' I was awful skared about old Rose  kissin of me again; and sais he, 'Sam, I want to show you my  establishment for making wooden clocks. One o' them can be  manufactured for two dollars, scale of prices then. Come to me for  three months, and I will teach you the trade, only you musn't carry it  on in Connecticut to undermine me.' I did so, and thus accidentally I  became a clockmaker.    \"To sell my wares I came to Nova Scotia. By a similar accident I met  the Squire in this province, and made his acquaintance. I wrote a  journal of our tour, and for want of a title he put my name to it, and  called it 'Sam Slick, the Clockmaker.' That book introduced me to  General Jackson, and he appointed me attach√© to our embassy to  England, and that again led to Mr Polk making me Commissioner of the  Fisheries, which, in its turn, was the means of my having the honour  of your acquaintance,\" and I made him a scrape of my hind leg.    \"Now,\" sais I, \"all this came from the accident of my havin' saved a  child's life one day. I owe my 'wise saws' to a similar accident. My  old master and friend, that you have read of in my books, Mr Hopewell,  was chock full of them. He used to call them wisdom boiled down to an  essence, concretes, and I don't know what all. He had a book full of  English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and above all, Bible ones.  Well, he used to make me learn them by heart for lessons, till I was  fairly sick and tired to death of 'em.    \"'Minister,' sais I, one day, 'what under the sun is the use of them  old, musty, fusty proverbs. A boy might as well wear his father's  boots, and ride in his long stirrups, as talk in maxims, it would only  set other boys a laughin' at him.'    \"'Sam,' sais he, 'you don't understand them now, and you don't  understand your Latin grammar, tho' you can say them both off by  heart. But you will see the value of one when you come to know the  world, and the other, when you come to know the language. The latter  will make you a good scholar, and the former a wise man.'    \"Minister was right, Doctor. As I came to read the book of life, I  soon began to understand, appreciate, and apply my proverbs. Maxims  are deductions ready drawn, and better expressed than I could do them,  to save my soul alive. Now I have larned to make them myself. I have  acquired the habit, as my brother the lawyer sais, 'of extracting the  principle from cases.' Do you take? I am not the accident of an  accident; for I believe the bans of marriage were always duly  published in our family; but I am the accident of an incident.\"    \"There is a great moral in that too, Mr Slick,\" he said. \"How  important is conduct, when the merest trifle may carry in its train  the misery or happiness of your future life.\"    \"Stick a pin in that also. Doctor,\" said I.    Here Cutler and the pilot cut short our conversation by going on  board. But Peter wouldn't hear of my leaving his house, and I  accordingly spent the night there, not a little amused with my new  acquaintances.                                      CHAPTER V.                          A NEW WAY TO LEARN GAELIC.      After the captain and the pilot had retired, sais I, \"Miss Jessie,  sposin we young folks--(ah me, it is time to get a new word, I guess,  for that one has been used so long, it's e'en amost worn out  now)--sposin we young folks leave the doctor and your father to finish  their huntin' stories, and let us go to the other room, and have a  dish of chat about things in general, and sweethearts in particular.\"    \"Oh, we live too much alone here,\" said she, \"to know anything of such  matters, but we will go if you will promise to tell us one of your  funny stories. They say you have written a whole book full of them;  how I should like to see it.\"    \"Would you, Miss?\" said I, \"well, then, you shall have one, for I have  a copy on board I believe, and I shall be only too proud if you will  read it to remember me by. But my best stories ain't in my books.  Somehow or another, when I want them they won't come, and at other  times when I get a goin talkin, I can string them together like  onions, one after the other, till the twine is out. I have a heap of  them, but they are all mixed and confused like in my mind, and it  seems as if I never could find the one I need. Do you work in worsted,  Miss?\"    \"Well, a little,\" sais she. \"It is only town-bred girls, who have  nothing to attend to but their dress and to go to balls, that have  leisure to amuse themselves that way; but I can work a little, though  I could never do anything fit to be seen or examined.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" said I, and I paused, and she looked as if she  didn't over half like my taking her at her word that way. \"I shouldn't  wonder,\" said I, \"for I am sure your eyes would fade the colour out of  the worsted.\"    \"Why, Mr Slick,\" said she, drawing herself up a bit, \"what nonsense  you do talk, what a quiz you be.\"    \"Fact,\" sais I, \"Miss, I assure you, never try it again, you will be  sure to spoil it. But as I was a sayin, Miss, when you see a thread of  a particular colour, you know whether you have any more like it or  not, so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#14)"],[1,"her more afraid of me than she  had occasion. Well, sir, said she, after what passed yesterday, and last  night, I think I went rather too far in favour of your injunctions  than otherwise; and I should have deserved every body's censure, as the  basest of creatures, had I been capable of contributing to your lawless  attempts. Still, Mrs. Jervis, still reflecting upon me, and all for  imaginary faults! for what harm have I done the girl?--I won't bear it,  I'll assure you. But yet, in respect to my mother, I am willing to part  friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom  of your conversation, in relation to me; which I should have resented  more than I do, but that I am conscious I had no business to demean  myself so as to be in your closet, where I might have expected to hear a  multitude of impertinence between you.    Well, sir, said she, you have no objection, I hope, to Pamela's going  away on Thursday next? You are mighty solicitous, said he, about Pamela:  But no, not I; let her go as soon as she will: She is a naughty girl,  and has brought all this upon herself; and upon me more trouble than she  can have had from me: But I have overcome it all, and will never concern  myself about her.    I have a proposal made me, added he, since I have been out this morning,  that I shall go near to embrace; and so wish only, that a discreet use  may be made of what is past; and there's an end of every thing with me,  as to Pamela, I'll assure you. I clasped my hands together through my  apron, overjoyed at this, though I was soon to go away: For, naughty as  he has been to me, I wish his prosperity with all my heart, for my good  old lady's sake. Well, Pamela, said he, you need not now be afraid to  speak to me; tell me what you lifted up your hands at? I said not a  word. Says he, If you like what I have said, give me your hand upon it.  I held my hand up through my apron; for I could not speak to him; and he  took hold of it, and pressed it, though less hard than he did my arm the  day before. What does the little fool cover her face for? said he: Pull  your apron away; and let me see how you look, after your freedom of  speech of me last night. No wonder you are ashamed to see me. You know  you were very free with my character.    I could not stand this barbarous insult, as I took it to be, considering  his behaviour to me; and I then spoke and said, O the difference between  the minds of thy creatures, good God! How shall some be cast down in  their innocence, while others can triumph in their guilt!    And so saying, I went up stairs to my chamber, and wrote all this; for  though he vexed me at his taunting, yet I was pleased to hear he was  likely to be married, and that his wicked intentions were so happily  overcome as to me; and this made me a little easier. And I hope I have  passed the worst; or else it is very hard. And yet I shan't think  myself at ease quite, till I am with you: For, methinks, after all,  his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon. But the  divine grace is not confined to space; and remorse may, and I hope has,  smitten him to the heart at once, for his injuries to poor me! Yet I  won't be too secure neither.    Having opportunity, I send now what I know will grieve you to the heart.  But I hope I shall bring my next scribble myself; and so conclude,  though half broken-hearted, Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER.          LETTER XXVII      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I am glad I desired you not to meet me, and John says you won't; for  he told you he is sure I shall get a passage well enough, either behind  some one of my fellow-servants on horseback, or by farmer Nichols's  means: but as to the chariot he talked to you of, I can't expect that  favour, to be sure; and I should not care for it, because it would look  so much above me. But farmer Brady, they say, has a chaise with one  horse, and we hope to borrow that, or hire it, rather than fail; though  money runs a little lowish, after what I have laid out; but I don't  care to say so here; though I warrant I might have what I would of Mrs.  Jervis, or Mr. Jonathan, or Mr. Longman; but then how shall I pay it?  you'll say: And, besides, I don't love to be beholden.    But the chief reason I'm glad you don't set out to meet me, is the  uncertainty; for it seems I must stay another week still, and hope  certainly to go Thursday after. For poor Mrs. Jervis will go at the same  time, she says, and can't be ready before.    Oh! that I was once well with you!--Though he is very civil too at  present, and not so cross as he was: and yet he is as vexatious another  way, as you shall hear. For yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes  brought home, which they call a birth-day suit; for he intends to go to  London against next birth-day, to see the court; and our folks will have  it he is to be made a lord.--I wish they may make him an honest man, as  he was always thought; but I have not found it so, alas for me!    And so, as I was saying, he had these clothes come home, and he tried  them on. And before he pulled them off, he sent for me, when nobody else  was in the parlour with him: Pamela, said he, you are so neat and so  nice in your own dress, (Alack-a-day, I didn't know I was!) that you  must be a judge of ours. How are these clothes made? Do they fit me?--I  am no judge, said I, and please your honour; but I think they look very  fine.    His waistcoat stood on end with silver lace, and he looked very grand.  But what he did last, has made me very serious, and I could make him no  compliments. Said he, Why don't you wear your usual clothes? Though I  think every thing looks well upon you (for I still continue in my new  dress). I said, I have no clothes, sir, I ought to call my own, but  these: and it is no matter what such an one as I wears. Said he, Why you  look very serious, Pamela. I see you can bear malice.--Yes, so I can,  sir, said I, according to the occasion! Why, said he, your eyes always  look red, I think. Are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to  heart? I am sure you, and that fool Mrs. Jervis, frightened me, by your  hideous squalling, as much as I could frighten you. That is all we  had for it, said I; and if you could be so afraid of your own servants  knowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature, that is under  your protection while I stay, surely your honour ought to be more afraid  of God Almighty, in whose presence we all stand, in every action of  our lives, and to whom the greatest, as well as the least, must be  accountable, let them think what they list.    He took my hand, in a kind of good-humoured mockery, and said, Well  urged, my pretty preacher! When my Lincolnshire chaplain dies, I'll  put thee on a gown and cassock, and thou'lt make a good figure in  his place.--I wish, said I, a little vexed at his jeer, your honour's  conscience would be your preacher, and then you would need no other  chaplain. Well, well, Pamela, said he, no more of this unfashionable  jargon. I did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit,  as to tell you, you are welcome to stay, since Mrs. Jervis desires it,  till she goes. I welcome! said I; I am sure I shall rejoice when I am  out of the house!    Well, said he, you are an ungrateful baggage; but I am thinking it would  be pity, with these fair soft hands, and that lovely skin, (as he called  it, and took hold of my hand,) that you should return again to hard  work, as you must if you go to your father's; and so I would advise her  to take a house in London, and let lodgings to us members of parliament,  when we come to town; and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for,  will always fill her house, and she'll get a great deal of money.    I was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke; but being ready to cry before,  the tears gushed out, and (endeavouring to get my hand from him, but in  vain) I said, I can expect no better: Your behaviour, sir, to me, has  been just of a piece with these words: Nay, I will say it, though you  were to be ever so angry.--I angry, Pamela? No, no, said he, I have  overcome all that; and as you are to go away, I look upon you now as  Mrs. Jervis's guest while you both stay, and not as my servant; and so  you may say what you will. But I'll tell you, Pamela, why you need not  take this matter in such high disdain!--You have a very pretty romantic  turn for virtue, and all that.--And I don't suppose but you'll hold  it still: and nobody will be able to prevail upon you. But, my child,  (sneeringly he spoke it,) do but consider what a fine opportunity you  will then have for a tale every day to good mother Jervis, and what  subjects for letter-writing to your father and mother, and what pretty  preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen. Ad's my heart! I  think it would be the best thing you and she could do.    You do well, sir, said I, to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me:  but, permit me to say, that if you was not rich and great, and I poor  and little, you would not insult me thus.--Let me ask you, sir, if you  think this becomes your fine clothes, and a master's station: Why so  serious, my pretty Pamela? said he: Why so grave? And would kiss me; but  my heart was full, and I said, Let me alone; I will tell you, if you was  a king, and insulted me as you have done, that you have forgotten to  act like a gentleman; and I won't stay to be used thus: I will go to the  next farmer's, and there wait for Mrs. Jervis, if she must go: and I'd  have you know, sir, that I can stoop to the ordinariest work of your  scullions, for all these nasty soft hands, sooner than bear such  ungentlemanly imputations.    I sent for you, said he, in high good humour; but it is impossible to  hold it with such an impertinent: however, I'll keep my temper. But  while I see you here, pray don't put on those dismal grave looks: Why,  girl, you should forbear them,"]]]
