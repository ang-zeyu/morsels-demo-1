'Very well, Gethryn,' he said, 'I shall report this to the Headmaster.'    And Gethryn, feeling that the conference was at an end, proceeded on  his way.    After chapel there was Norris to be handled. Norris had been rather  late for chapel that morning, and had no opportunity of speaking to the  Bishop. But after the service was over, and the School streamed out of  the building towards their respective houses, he waylaid him at the  door, and demanded an explanation. The Bishop refused to give one.  Norris, whose temper never had a chance of reaching its accustomed  tranquillity until he had consumed some breakfast--he hated early  morning chapel--raved. The Bishop was worried, but firm.    'Then you mean to say--you don't mean to say--I mean, you don't intend  to explain?' said Norris finally, working round for the twentieth time  to his original text.    'I can't explain.'    'You won't, you mean.'    'Yes. I'll apologize if you like, but I won't explain.'    Norris felt the strain was becoming too much for him.    'Apologize!' he moaned, addressing circumambient space. 'Apologize! A  man cuts off in the middle of the M.C.C. match, loses us the game, and  then comes back and offers to apologize.'    'The offer's withdrawn,' put in Gethryn. 'Apologies and explanations  are both off.' It was hopeless to try and be conciliatory under the  circumstances. They did not admit of it.    Norris glared.    'I suppose,' he said, 'you don't expect to go on playing for the First  after this? We can't keep a place open for you in the team on the off  chance of your not having a previous engagement, you know.'    'That's your affair,' said the Bishop, 'you're captain. Have you  finished your address? Is there anything else you'd like to say?'    Norris considered, and, as he went in at Jephson's gate, wound up with  this Parthian shaft--    'All I can say is that you're not fit to be at a public school. They  ought to sack a chap for doing that sort of thing. If you'll take my  advice, you'll leave.'    About two hours afterwards Gethryn discovered a suitable retort, but,  coming to the conclusion that better late than never does not apply to  repartees, refrained from speaking it.    It was Mr Jephson's usual custom to sally out after supper on Sunday  evenings to smoke a pipe (or several pipes) with one of the other  House-masters. On this particular evening he made for Robertson's,  which was one of the four Houses on the opposite side of the School  grounds. He could hardly have selected a better man to take his  grievance to. Mr Robertson was a long, silent man with grizzled hair,  and an eye that pierced like a gimlet. He had the enviable reputation  of keeping the best order of any master in the School. He was also one  of the most popular of the staff. This was all the more remarkable from  the fact that he played no games.    To him came Mr Jephson, primed to bursting point with his grievance.    'Anything wrong, Jephson?' said Mr Robertson.    'Wrong? I should just think there was. Did you happen to be looking at  the match yesterday, Robertson?'    Mr Robertson nodded.    'I always watch School matches. Good match. Norris missed a bad catch  in the slips. He was asleep.'    Mr Jephson conceded the point. It was trivial.    'Yes,' he said, 'he should certainly have held it. But that's a mere  detail. I want to talk about Gethryn. Do you know what he did  yesterday? I never heard of such a thing in my life, never. Went off  during the luncheon interval without a word, and never appeared again  till lock-up. And now he refuses to offer any explanation whatever. I  shall report the whole thing to Beckett. I told Gethryn so this  morning.'    'I shouldn't,' said Mr Robertson; 'I really think I shouldn't. Beckett  finds the ordinary duties of a Headmaster quite sufficient for his  needs. This business is not in his province at all.'    'Not in his province? My dear sir, what is a headmaster for, if not to  manage affairs of this sort?'    Mr Robertson smiled in a sphinx-like manner, and answered, after the  fashion of Socrates, with a question.    'Let me ask you two things, Jephson. You must proceed gingerly. Now,  firstly, it is a headmaster's business to punish any breach of school  rules, is it not?'    'Well?'    'And school prefects do not attend roll-call, and have no restrictions  placed upon them in the matter of bounds?'    'No. Well?'    'Then perhaps you'll tell me what School rule Gethryn has broken?' said  Mr Robertson.    'You see you can't,' he went on. 'Of course you can't. He has not  broken any School rule. He is a prefect, and may do anything he likes  with his spare time. He chooses to play cricket. Then he changes his  mind and goes off to some unknown locality for some reason at present  unexplained. It is all perfectly legal. Extremely quaint behaviour on  his part, I admit, but thoroughly legal.'    'Then nothing can be done,' exclaimed Mr Jephson blankly. 'But it's  absurd. Something must be done. The thing can't be left as it is. It's  preposterous!'    'I should imagine,' said Mr Robertson, 'from what small knowledge I  possess of the Human Boy, that matters will be made decidedly  unpleasant for the criminal.'    'Well, I know one thing; he won't play for the team again.'    'There is something very refreshing about your logic, Jephson. Because  a boy does not play in one match, you will not let him play in any of  the others, though you admit his absence weakens the team. However, I  suppose that is unavoidable. Mind you, I think it is a pity. Of course  Gethryn has some explanation, if he would only favour us with it.  Personally I think rather highly of Gethryn. So does poor old  Leicester. He is the only Head-prefect Leicester has had for the last  half-dozen years who knows even the rudiments of his business. But it's  no use my preaching his virtues to you. You wouldn't listen. Take  another cigar, and let's talk about the weather.'    Mr Jephson took the proffered weed, and the conversation, though it did  not turn upon the suggested topic, ceased to have anything to do with  Gethryn.    The general opinion of the School was dead against the Bishop. One or  two of his friends still clung to a hope that explanations might come  out, while there were also a few who always made a point of thinking  differently from everybody else. Of this class was Pringle. On the  Monday after the match he spent the best part of an hour of his  valuable time reasoning on the subject with Lorimer. Lorimer's vote  went with the majority. Although he had fielded for the Bishop, he was  not, of course, being merely a substitute, allowed to bowl, as the  Bishop had had his innings, and it had been particularly galling to him  to feel that he might have saved the match, if it had only been  possible for him to have played a larger part.    'It's no good jawing about it,' he said, 'there isn't a word to say for  the man. He hasn't a leg to stand on. Why, it would be bad enough in a  House or form match even, but when it comes to first matches--!' Here  words failed Lorimer.    'Not at all,' said Pringle, unmoved. 'There are heaps of reasons, jolly  good reasons, why he might have gone away.'    'Such as?' said Lorimer.    'Well, he might have been called away by a telegram, for instance.'    'What rot! Why should he make such a mystery of it if that was all?'    'He'd have explained all right if somebody had asked him properly. You  get a chap like Norris, who, when he loses his hair, has got just about  as much tact as a rhinoceros, going and ballyragging the man, and no  wonder he won't say anything. I shouldn't myself.'    'Well, go and talk to him decently, then. Let's see you do it, and I'll  bet it won't make a bit of difference. What the chap has done is to go  and get himself mixed up in some shady business somewhere. That's the  only thing it can be.'    'Rot,' said Pringle, 'the Bishop isn't that sort of chap.'    'You can't tell. I say,' he broke off suddenly, 'have you done that  poem yet?'    Pringle started. He had not so much as begun that promised epic.    'I--er--haven't quite finished it yet. I'm thinking it out, you know.  Getting a sort of general grip of the thing.'    'Oh. Well, I wish you'd buck up with it. It's got to go in tomorrow  week.'    'Tomorrow week. Tuesday the what? Twenty-second, isn't it? Right. I'll  remember. Two days after the O.B.s' match. That'll fix it in my mind.  By the way, your people are going to come down all right, aren't they?  I mean, we shall have to be getting in supplies and so on.'    'Yes. They'll be coming. There's plenty of time, though, to think of  that. What you've got to do for the present is to keep your mind glued  on the death of Dido.'    'Rather,' said Pringle, 'I won't forget.'    This was at six twenty-two p.m. By the time six-thirty boomed from the  College clock-tower, Pringle was absorbing a thrilling work of fiction,  and Dido, her death, and everything connected with her, had faded from  his mind like a beautiful dream.          [11]    POETRY AND STUMP-CRICKET      The Old Beckfordians' match came off in due season, and Pringle enjoyed  it thoroughly. Though he only contributed a dozen in the first innings,  he made up for this afterwards in the second, when the School had a  hundred and twenty to get in just two hours. He went in first with  Marriott, and they pulled the thing off and gave the School a ten  wickets victory with eight minutes to spare. Pringle was in rare form.  He made fifty-three, mainly off the bowling of a certain J.R. Smith,  whose fag he had been in the old days. When at School, Smith had always  been singularly aggressive towards Pringle, and the latter found that  much pleasure was to be derived from hitting fours off his bowling.  Subsequently he ate more strawberries and cream than were, strictly  speaking, good for him, and did the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#14)"],[1,"28), through which the air passes to and  from the lungs. If the cords are tightened, the edges approach sometimes  within 1/100 of an inch of each other, and, being thrown into vibration,  cause corresponding vibrations in the current of air. Thus sound is  produced in the same manner as by the vibrations of the tongues of an  accordion, or the strings of a violin, only in this case the strings are  scarcely an inch long.    FIG. 27.    [Illustration: _Passage to the sophagus and Windpipe._ c, _the  tongue;_ d, _the soft palate, ending in_ g, _the uvula;_ h,  _the epiglottis;_ i, _the glottis;_ I, _the sophagus;_ f,  _the pharynx._]    DIFFERENT TONES OF THE VOICE.--The higher tones of the voice are produced  when the cords are short, tight, and closely in contact; the lower, by the  opposite conditions. Loudness is regulated by the quantity of air and  force of expulsion. A falsetto voice is thought to be the result of a  peculiarity in the pharynx (Fig. 27) at the back part of the nose; it is  more probably produced by some muscular maneuver not yet fully understood.  When boys are about fourteen years of age, the larynx enlarges, and the  cords grow proportionately longer and coarser; hence, the voice becomes  deeper, or, as we say, \"changes.\" The peculiar harshness of the voice at  this time seems to be due to a congestion of the mucous membrane of the  cords. The change may occur very suddenly, the voice breaking in a single  night.    FIG. 28.    [Illustration: e, e, _the vocal cords;_ d, _the epiglottis._]    Speech is voice modulated by the lips, tongue, [Footnote: The tongue is  styled the \"unruly member,\" and held responsible for all the tattling of  the world; but when the tongue is removed, the adjacent organs in some way  largely supply the deficiency, so that speech is still possible. Huxley  describes the conversation of a man who had two and one half inches of his  tongue preserved in spirits, and yet could converse intelligibly. Only the  two letters _t_ and _d_ were beyond his power; the articulation  of these involves the employment of the tip of the tongue; hence, \"tin\" he  converted into \"fin,\" and \"dog\" into \"thog.\"] palate, and teeth.  [Footnote: An artificial larynx may be made by using elastic bands to  represent the vocal cords, and by placing above them chambers which by  their resonance will produce the same effect as the cavities lying above  the larynx. An artificial speaking machine was constructed by Kempelen,  which could pronounce such sentences as, \"I love you with all my heart,\"  in different languages, by simply touching the proper keys.] Speech and  voice are commonly associated, but speech may exist without the voice, for  when we whisper we articulate the words, although there is no  vocalization, _i. e._, no action of the larynx. [Footnote: We can  observe this by placing the hand on the throat, and noticing the absence  of vibrations when we whisper, and their presence when we talk. The  difference between vocalization and non-vocalization is seen in a sigh and  a groan, the latter being the former vocalized. Whistling is a pure mouth  sound, and does not depend on the voice. Laughter is vocal, being the  aspirated vowels, a, e, or o, convulsively repeated.] (See p. 297.)    FIG. 29.    [Illustration: _The Lungs, showing the Larynx._ A, _the  windpipe;_ B, _the bronchial tubes._]    FORMATION OF VOCAL SOUNDS.--The method of modulating voice into speech may  be seen by producing the pure vowel sounds _a, e_, etc., from one  expiration, the mouth being kept open while the form of the aperture is  changed for each vowel by the tongue and the lips. _H_ is only an  explosion, or forcible throwing of a vowel sound from the mouth.  [Footnote: When, in sounding a vowel, the sound coincides with a sudden  change in the position of the vocal cords from one of divergence to one of  approximation, the vowel is pronounced with the _spiritus asper_.  When the vocal cords are brought together before the blast of air begins,  the vowel is pronounced with the _spiritus lenis._--FOSTER.]    The consonants, or short sounds, may also be made without interrupting the  current of air, by various modifications of the vocal organs. In sounding  singly any one of the letters, we can detect its peculiar requirements.  Thus _m_ and _n_ can be made only by blocking the air in the  mouth and sending it through the nose; _l_ lets the air escape at the  sides of the tongue; _r_ needs a vibratory movement of the tongue;  _b_ and _p_ stop the breath at the lips; _k_ and _g_ (hard), at the  back of the palate. Consonants like _b_ and _d_ are abrupt, or, like  _l_ and _s_, continuous. Those made by the lips are termed _labials_;  those by pressing the tongue against the teeth, _dentals_; those by the  tongue, _linguals_.    The child gains speech slowly, first learning to pronounce the vowel  _a_, the consonants _b, m_, and _p_, and then their unions --_ba, ma, pa_.    DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION.--Beneath the larynx is the  windpipe, or _trachea_ (see Fig. 29), so called because of its  roughness. It is strengthened by C-shaped cartilages with the openings  behind, where they are attached to the sophagus. At the lower end, the  trachea divides into two branches, called the right and left  _bronchi_. These subdivide in the small bronchial tubes, which ramify  through the lungs like the branches of a tree, the tiny twigs of which at  last end in clusters of cells so small that there are six hundred million  in all. This cellular structure renders the lungs exceedingly soft,  elastic, and sponge-like. [Footnote: The lungs of slaughtered animals are  vulgarly called \"lights,\" probably on account of their lightness. They are  similar in structure to those of man. They will float on water, and if a  small piece be forcibly squeezed between the fingers (notice the creaking  sound it gives), it will retain sufficient air to make it buoyant.]    FIG. 30.    [Illustration: _Bronchial Tubes, with clusters of cells._]    The stiff, cartilaginous rings, so noticeable in the rough surface of the  trachea and the bronchi, disappear as we reach the smaller bronchial  tubes, so that while the former are kept constantly open for the free  admission of air, the latter are provided with elastic fibers by which  they may be almost closed.    WRAPPING OF THE LUNGS.--The lungs are invested with a double covering--the  _pleura_--one layer being attached to the lungs and the other to the  walls of the chest. It secretes a fluid which lubricates it, so that the  layers glide upon each other with perfect ease. [Footnote: These pleural  sacs are distinct and closed; hence, when the ribs are raised, a partial  vacuum being formed in the sacs, air rushes in, and distends the pulmonary  lobules.] The lungs are lined with mucous membrane, exceedingly delicate  and sensitive to the presence of anything except pure air. We have all  noticed this when we have breathed any thing offensive.    FIG. 31.    [Illustration: A, _the heart;_ B, _the lungs drawn aside to show  the internal organs;_ C, _the diaphragm;_ D, _the liver;_ E,  _the gall cyst;_ F, _the stomach;_ G,_ the small intestines;_ H,  _the transverse colon._]    THE CILIA.--Along the air passages are minute filaments (_cilia_,  Fig. 32), which are in constant motion, like a field of grain stirred by a  gentle breeze. They serve to fan the air in the lungs, and produce an  outward current, which is useful in catching dust and fine particles swept  inward with the breath.    HOW WE BREATHE.--Respiration consists of two acts--taking in the air, or  _inspiration_, and expelling the air, or _expiration_.    FIG. 32.    [Illustration: B, _a section of the mucous membrane, showing the cilia  rising from the peculiar epithelial cells on the outside of the mucous  membrane lining the tubes;_ A, _a single cell more highly  magnified._]    1. _Inspiration_.--When we draw in a full breath, we straighten the  spine and throw the head and shoulders back, so as to give the greatest  advantage to the muscles. [Footnote: If we examine the bony cage of the  thorax or chest in Fig. 8, we shall see that the position of the ribs may  alter its capacity in two ways.    1. As they run obliquely downward from the spine, if the sternum or  breastbone be lifted in front, the diameter of the chest will be  increased.    2. The ribs are fastened by elastic cartilages, which stretch as the  muscles that lift the ribs contract, and so increase the breadth of the  chest.]    At the same time, the diaphragm [Footnote: The diaphragm is the muscular  partition between the chest and the abdomen. It is always convex toward  the former, and concave toward the latter (Fig. 31). Long muscular fibers  extend from its center toward the ribs in front and the spine at the back.  When these contract, they depress and flatten the diaphragm; when they  relax, it becomes convex again. In the former case, the bowels are pressed  downward and the abdomen pushed outward; in the latter, the bowels spring  upward, and the abdomen is drawn inward.] descends and presses the walls  of the abdomen outward. Both these processes increase the size of the  chest. Thereupon, the elastic lungs expand to occupy the extra space,  while the air, rushing in through the windpipe, pours along the bronchial  tubes and crowds into every cell. [Footnote: It is said that in drawing a  full breath, the muscles exert a force equal to raising a weight of seven  hundred and fifty pounds. When we are about to make a great effort, as in  striking a heavy blow, we naturally take a deep inspiration, and shut the  glottis. The confined air makes the chest tense and firm, and enables us  to exert a greater force. As we let slip the blow, the glottis opens and  the air escapes, often with a curious aspirated sound as is noticeable in  workmen. To make a good shot with a rifle, we should take aim with a full  chest and tight breath, since"]]]
