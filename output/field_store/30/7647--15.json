If, on the other hand, there was room in  the shed for one or both of them, and the boss told them to go to work  in the morning, they'd keep it quiet from the cook if possible, and  depart, after breakfast, unostentatiously.    Sometimes, at the beginning of a drought, when the tall dead grass was  like tinder for hundreds of miles and a carelessly-dropped match  would set the whole country on fire, Swampy would strike a hard-faced  squatter, manager or overseer with a cold eye, and the conversation  would be somewhat as follows:    Swampy: \"Good day, boss!\"    Boss (shortly): \"'Day.\"    Swampy: \"Any chance of a job?\"    Boss: \"Naw. Got all I want and we don't start for a fortnight.\"    Swampy: \"Can I git a bit o' meat?\"    Boss: \"Naw! Don't kill till Saturday.\"    Swampy: \"Pint o' flour?\"    Boss: \"Naw. Short ourselves.\"    Swampy: \"Bit o' tea or sugar, boss?\"    Boss: \"Naw--what next?\"    Swampy: \"Bit o' baccer, boss. Ain't had a smoke for a week.\"    Boss: \"Naw. Ain't got enough for meself till the wagon comes out.\"    Swampy: \"Ah, well! It's hot, ain't it, boss?\"    Boss: \"Yes-it's hot.\"    Swampy: \"Country very dry?\"    Boss: \"Yes. Looks like it.\"    Swampy: \"A fire 'ud be very bad just now?\"    Boss: \"Eh?\"    Swampy: \"Yes. Now I'm allers very careful with matches an' fire when I'm  on the track.\"    Boss \"Are yer?\"    Swampy: \"Yes. I never lights a fire near the grass--allers in the middle  of the track--it's the safest place yer can get. An' I allers puts the  fire out afore I leaves the camp. If there ain't no water ter spare  I covers the ashes with dirt. An' some fellers are so careless with  matches lightin' their pipes.\" (Reflective pause.)    Boss: \"Are they?\"    Swampy: \"Yes. Now, when I lights me pipe on the track in dry weather I  allers rubs the match head up an' drops it in the dust. I never drops  a burnin' match. But some travellers is so careless. A chap might light  his pipe an' fling the match away without thinkin' an' the match might  fall in a dry tuft, an'-there yer are!\" (with a wave of his arms).  \"Hundreds of miles o' grass gone an' thousands o' sheep starvin'. Some  fellers is so careless--they never thinks.... An' what's more, they  don't care if they burn the whole country.\"    Boss (scratching his head reflectively): \"Ah-umph! You can go up to the  store and get a bit of tucker. The storekeeper might let yer have a bit  o' tobacco.\"      On one occasion, when they were out of flour and meat; Brummy and Swampy  came across two other pilgrims camped on a creek, who were also out of  flour and meat. One of them had tried a surveyors' camp a little further  down, but without success. The surveyors' cook had said that he was  short of flour and meat himself. Brummy tried him--no luck. Then Swampy  said he'd go and have a try. As luck would have it, the surveyors' cook  was just going to bake; he had got the flour out in the dish, put in  the salt and baking powder, mixed it up, and had gone to the creek for  a billy of water when Swampy arrived. While the cook was gone Swampy  slipped the flour out of the dish into his bag, _wiped_ the dish, set it  down again, and planted the bag behind a tree at a little distance. Then  he stood waiting, holding a spare empty bag in his hand. When the cook  came back he glanced at the dish, lowered the billy of water slowly  to the ground, scratched his head, and looked at the dish again in a  puzzled way.    \"Blanked if I didn't think I got that flour out!\" he said.    \"What's that, mate?\" asked Swampy.    \"Why! I could have sworn I got the flour out in the dish and mixed it  before I went for the water,\" said the cook, staring at the dish again.  \"It's rum what tricks your memory plays on you sometimes.\"    \"Yes,\" said Swampy, showing interest, while the cook got some more flour  out into the dish from a bag in the back of the tent. \"It is strange.  I've done the same, thing meself. I suppose it's the heat that makes us  all a bit off at times.\"    \"Do you cook, then?\" asked the surveyors' cook.    \"Well, yes. I've done a good bit of it in me time; but it's about played  out. I'm after stragglers now.\" (Stragglers are stray sheep missed in  the general muster and found about the out paddocks and shorn after the  general shearing.)    They had a yarn and Swampy \"bit the cook's ear\" for a \"bit o' meat an'  tea an' sugar,\" not forgetting \"a handful of flour if yer can spare it.\"    \"Sorry,\" said the cook, \"but I can only let you have about a pint. We're  very short ourselves.\"    \"Oh, that's all right!\" said Swampy, as he put the stuff into his spare  bags. \"Thank you! Good day!\"    \"Good day,\" said the cook. The cook went on with his work and Swampy  departed, catching up the bag of flour from behind the tree as he passed  it, and keeping the clump of timber well between him and the surveyors'  camp, lest the cook should glance round, and, noticing the increased  bulk of his load, get some new ideas concerning mental aberration.      Nearly every bushman has at least one superstition, or notion, that  lasts his time--as nearly every bushman has at least one dictionary word  which lasts him all his life. Brummy had a gloomy notion--Lord knows how  he got it!--that he should 'a' gone on the boards if his people hadn't  been so ignorant. He reckoned that he had the face and cut of an  actor, could mimic any man's voice, and had wonderful control over his  features. They came to a notoriously \"hungry\" station, where there was  a Scottish manager and storekeeper. Brummy went up to \"government house\"  in his own proper person, had a talk with the storekeeper, spoke of a  sick mate, and got some flour and meat. They camped down the creek, and  next morning Brummy started to shave himself.    \"Whatever are you a-doin' of, Brummy?\" gasped Swampy in great  astonishment.    \"Wait and see,\" growled Brummy, with awful impressiveness, as if he were  going to cut Swampy's throat after he'd finished shaving. He shaved  off his beard and whiskers, put on a hat and coat belonging to Swampy,  changed his voice, dropped his shoulders, and went limping up to the  station on a game leg. He saw the cook and got some \"brownie,\" a bit of  cooked meat and a packet of baking powder. Then he saw the storekeeper  and approached the tobacco question. Sandy looked at him and listened  with some slight show of interest, then he said:    \"Oh that's all right now! But ye needn't ha' troublt shavin' yer  beard--the cold weather's comin' on! An' yer mate's duds don't suit  ye--they 're too sma'; an' yer game leg doesn't fit ye either--it takes  a lot o' practice. Ha' ye got ony tea an' sugar?\"    Brummy must have touched something responsive in that old Scot  somewhere, but his lack of emotion upset Brummy somewhat, or else an old  deep-rooted superstition had been severely shaken. Anyway he let Swampy  do the cadging for several days thereafter.      But one bad season they were very hard up indeed--even for Brummy  and Swampy. They'd tramped a long hungry track and had only met a few  wretched jackaroos, driven out of the cities by hard times, and tramping  hopelessly west. They were out of tobacco, and their trousers were so  hopelessly \"gone\" behind that when they went to cadge at a place where  there was a woman they were moved to back and sidle and edge away  again--and neither Brummy nor Swampy was over fastidious in matters  of dress or personal appearance. It was absolutely necessary to earn a  pound or two, so they decided to go to work for a couple of weeks. It  wouldn't hurt them, and then there was the novelty of it.    They struck West-o'-Sunday Station, and the boss happened to want a  rouseabout to pick up wool and sweep the floor for the shearers.    \"I can put _one_ of you on,\" he said. \"Fix it up between yourselves and  go to work in the morning.\"    Brummy and Swampy went apart to talk it over.    \"Look here! Brum, old man,\" said Swampy, with great heartiness, \"we've  been mates for a long while now, an' shared an' shared alike. You've  allers acted straight to me an' I want to do the fair thing by you.  _I_ don't want to stand in _your_ light. You take the job an' I'll be  satisfied with a pair of pants out of it and a bit o' tobacco now an'  agen. There yer are! I can't say no fairer than that.\"    \"Yes,\" said Brummy, resentfully, \"an' you'll always be thrown' it up to  me afterwards that I done you out of a job!\"    \"I'll swear I won't,\" said Swampy, hurriedly. \"But since you're so  blasted touchy and suspicious about it, _you_ take this job an' I'll  take the next that turns up. How'll that suit you?\"    Brummy thought resentfully.    \"Look here!\" he said presently, \"let's settle it and have done with this  damned sentimental tommy-rot. I'll tell you what I'll do--I'll give you  the job and take my chance. The boss might want another man to-morrow.  Now, are you satisfied?\"    But Swampy didn't look grateful or happy.    \"Well,\" growled Brummy, \"of all the ---- I ever travelled with you're  the ----. What do you want anyway? What'll satisfy you? That's all I  want to know. Hey?--can't yer speak?\"    \"Let's toss up for it,\" said Swampy, sulkily.    \"All right,\" said Brummy, with a big oath, and he felt in his pocket for  two old pennies he had. But Swampy had got a suspicion somehow that one  of those pennies had two heads on it, and he wasn't sure that the other  hadn't two tails--also, he suspected Brummy of some skill in \"palming,\"  so he picked up a chip from the wood-heap, spat on it, and spun it into  the air. \"Sing out!\" he cried, \"wet or dry?\"    \"Dry,\" said Brummy, promptly. He had a theory that the wet side of the  chip, being presumably heaviest, was more likely to fall downwards;  but this time it was \"wet\" up three times in succession. Brummy ignored  Swampy's hand thrown out in hearty congratulation; and next morning  he went to work in the shed. Swampy camped down the river, and Brummy  supplied him with a cheap pair of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#14)"],[1,"places that have escaped the searchers,  but what they could not with their host of workers find certainly could  not be found by four or five men. It is not in the temples that the  Incas' wealth has been hidden, but in caves, in deep mountain gorges,  and possibly in ruins on the other side of the mountains where even the  Spaniards never penetrated. There are such places. I know of one to  which I will take you if our search fails elsewhere. It is near the  sea, and yet there are not half a dozen living men who have ever seen  it, so strangely is it hidden. Tradition says that it was not the work  of the Incas, but of the people before them. I have never seen it  close. It is guarded, they say, by demons, and no native would go  within miles of it. The traditions are that the Incas, when they  conquered the land, found the place and searched it, after starving out  the native chief who had fled there with his followers and family. Some  say that they found great treasure there, others that they discovered  nothing; all agree that a pestilence carried off nearly all those who  had captured it. Others went, and they too died, and the place was  abandoned as accursed, and in time its very existence became forgotten;  though some say that members of the tribe have always kept watch there,  and that those who carelessly or curiously approached it have always  met with their death in strange ways. Although I am a Christian, and  have been taught to disbelieve the superstitions of my countrymen, I  would not enter it on any condition.\"    \"If we happen to be near it I shall certainly take a close look at it,\"  Harry said with a laugh. \"I don't fancy we should see anything that our  rifles and pistols would find invulnerable.\"    It was getting dark by the time they had finished their inspection of  the rooms, so, riding two or three miles away, they encamped in a grove  up the valley. Next morning they returned to Lima. Dias had given out  that the two white senors intended to visit all the ruined temples of  the Incas, and as other travellers had done the same their intention  excited neither surprise nor comment.    On the following evening after dark Harry and his brother were  returning from the house of Senor Pasquez.    \"It is a pleasant house,\" Harry said; \"the girls are pretty and nice,  they play and sing well, and are really charming. But what a contrast  it was the other morning when we went in there and accidentally ran  against them when we were going upstairs with their father, utterly  untidy, and, in fact, regular sluts--a maid of all work would look a  picture of neatness beside them.\"    Bertie was about to answer, when there was an outburst of shouts from a  wine-shop they were passing, and in a moment the door burst open and  half a dozen men engaged in a fierce conflict rushed out. Knives were  flashing, and it was evident that one man was being attacked by the  rest. By the light that streamed out of the open door they saw that the  man attacked was Dias. It flashed across Harry's mind that if this man  was killed there was an end to all hope of success in their expedition.    \"Dash in to his rescue, Bertie,\" he cried; \"but whatever you do, mind  their knives.\"    With a shout he sprang forward and struck to the ground a man who was  dodging behind Dias with uplifted knife, while Bertie leapt on to the  back of another, the shock throwing the man down face forward. Bertie  was on his feet in a moment, and brought the stick he carried with all  his force down on the man's head as he tried to rise. Then, springing  forward again, he struck another man a heavy blow on the wrist. The  knife dropped from the man's hand, and as he dashed with a fierce oath  upon Bertie the stick descended again, this time on his head, and  felled him to the ground. In the meantime one of the assailants had  turned fiercely on Harry and aimed a blow at him with his knife; but  with the ease of a practised boxer Harry stepped back, and before the  man could again raise the knife he leaped in and struck him a  tremendous blow on the point of his chin. The fifth man took to his  heels immediately. The other four lay where they had fallen, evidently  fearing they would be stabbed should they try to get on to their feet.    \"Are you hurt, Dias?\" Harry exclaimed.    \"I have several cuts, senor, but none of them, I think, serious. You  have saved my life.\"    \"Never mind that now, Dias. What shall we do with these fellows--hand  them over to the watch?\"    \"No, senor, that would be the last thing to do; we might be detained  here for months. I will take all their knives and let them go.\"    \"Here are two of them,\" Bertie said, picking up those of the men he had  struck.    Dias stood over the man Harry had first knocked down, and with a fierce  whisper ordered him to give up his knife, which he did at once. The  other was still stupid from the effect of the blow and his fall, and  Dias had only to take his knife from his relaxed fingers.    \"Now, senor, let us be going before anyone comes along.\"    \"What was it all about, Dias?\" Harry asked as he walked away.    \"Many of the muleteers are jealous, senor, because I always get what  they consider the best jobs. I had gone into the wine-shop for a glass  of pulque before going round to see that the mules were all right. As I  was drinking, these men whispered together, and then one came up to me  and began to abuse me, and directly I answered him the whole of them  drew their knives and rushed at me. I was ready too, and wounded two of  them as I fought my way to the door. As I opened it one of them stabbed  me in the shoulder, but it was a slanting blow. Once out they all  attacked me at once, and in another minute you would have had to look  for another muleteer. 'Tis strange, senors, that you should have saved  my life as Mr. Barnett did. It was a great deed to risk your lives with  no weapons but your sticks against five ruffians with their knives.\"    \"I did not use my stick,\" Harry said. \"I am more accustomed to use my  fists than a stick, and can hit as hard with them, as you saw. But my  brother's stick turned out the most useful. He can box too, but cannot  give as heavy a blow as I can. Still, it was very lucky that I followed  your advice, and bought a couple of heavy sticks to carry with us if we  should go out after dark. Now you had better come to the hotel, and I  will send for a surgeon to dress your wound.\"    \"It is not necessary, senor; my wife is waiting for me in my room, she  arrived this afternoon. Knife cuts are not uncommon affairs here, and  she knows quite enough to be able to bandage them.\"    \"At any rate we shall have to put off our start for a few days.\"    \"Not at all, senor; a bandage tonight and a few strips of plaster in  the morning will do the business. I shall be stiff for a few days, but  that will not interfere with my riding, and Jose will be able to load  and unload the mules, if you will give him a little assistance. Adios!  and a thousand thanks.\"    \"That was a piece of luck, Bertie,\" Harry said when they had reached  their room in the hotel. \"In the first place, because neither of us got  a scratch, and in the second, because it will bind Dias more closely to  us. Before, he was willing to assist us for Barnett's sake, now it will  be for our own also, and we may be quite sure that he will do his best  for us.\"    \"It is my first scrimmage,\" Bertie said, \"and I must say that I  thought, as we ran in, that it was going to be a pretty serious one. We  have certainly come very well out of it.\"    \"It was short and sharp,\" Harry laughed. \"I have always held that the  man who could box well was more than a match for one with a knife who  knew nothing of boxing. One straight hit from the shoulder is sure to  knock him out of time.\"    Next morning Dias and his wife came up early. The former had one arm in  a sling. As they entered, the woman ran forward, and, throwing her arms  round Bertie, she kissed him on both cheeks. The lad was too much  surprised at this unexpected salute to return it, as his brother did  when she did the same to him. Then, drawing back, she poured out her  thanks volubly, the tears running down her cheeks.    \"Maria asked me if she might kiss you,\" Dias said gravely when she  stopped. \"I said that it was right that she should do so, for do we not  both owe you my life?\"    \"You must not make too much of the affair, Dias; four blows were  struck, and there was an end to it.\"    \"A small matter to you, senor, but a great one to us. A Peruvian would  not interfere if he saw four armed men attacking one. He would be more  likely to turn down the next street, so that he might not be called as  a witness. It is only your countrymen who would do such things.\"    \"And you still think that you will be ready to start the day after  to-morrow?\"    \"Quite sure, senor. My shoulder will be stiff and my arm in a sling for  a week, but muleteers think nothing of such trifles,--a kick from a  mule would be a much more serious affair.\"    \"You don't think those rascals are likely to waylay us on the road, and  take their revenge?\"    \"Not they, senor. If you could do such things unarmed, what could you  not do when you had rifles and pistols? The matter is settled. They  have not been seriously hurt. If one of them had been killed I should  be obliged to be careful the next time I came here; as it is, no more  will be said about it. Except the two hurt in the wine-shop they will  not even have a scar to remind them of it. In two years they will have  other things to think about, if it is true that Colombia means to go to  war with Chili.\"    \"What is the quarrel about, Dias?\"    \"The Colombians helped us to get rid of the Spaniards, but ever since  they have presumed a right to manage affairs here.\"    \"Perhaps nothing will come of it.\"    \"Well, it is quite certain that there is no very good feeling between  Chili, Bolivia, "]]]
