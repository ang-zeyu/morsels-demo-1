[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"five A.M., after drowsily stumbling through hours of outer  gloom, we entered a spacious basin at least six miles broad, and  limited by a circlet of low hill. It was overgrown with camel-grass and  Acacia (Shittim) trees, mere vegetable mummies; in many places the  water had left a mark; and here and there the ground was pitted with  mud-flakes, the remains of recently dried pools. After an hours rapid  march we toiled over a rugged ridge, composed of broken and detached  blocks of basalt and scoriæ, fantastically piled together, and dotted  with thorny trees. Shaykh Masud passed the time in walking to and fro  along his line of camels, addressing us with a Khallikum guddam, to the  front (of the litter)! as we ascended, and a Khallikum wara, to the rear!  during the descent. It was wonderful to see the animals stepping from  block to block with the sagacity of mountaineers; assuring themselves  of their forefeet before trusting all their weight to advance. Not a  camel fell, either here or on any other ridge: they moaned, however,  piteously, for the sudden turns of the path puzzled them; the ascents  were painful, the descents were still more so; the rocks were sharp;  deep holes yawned between the blocks, and occasionally an Acacia caught  the Shugduf, almost overthrowing the hapless bearer by the suddenness  and the tenacity of its clutch. This passage took place during  daylight. But we had many at night, which I shall neither forget nor  describe.    Descending the ridge, we entered another hill-encircled basin of gravel  and clay. In many places basalt in piles and crumbling strata of  hornblende schiste, disposed edgeways, green within, and without  blackened by sun and rain, cropped out of the ground. At half-past ten  we    [p.69] found ourselves in an Acacia-barren, one of the things which  pilgrims dread. Here Shugdufs are bodily pulled off the camels back and  broken upon the hard ground; the animals drop upon their knees, the  whole line is deranged, and every one, losing temper, attacks his  Moslem brother. The road was flanked on the left by an iron wall of  black basalt. Noon brought us to another ridge, whence we descended  into a second wooded basin surrounded by hills.    Here the air was filled with those pillars of sand so graphically  described by Abyssinian Bruce. They scudded on the wings of the  whirlwind over the plain,huge yellow shafts, with lofty heads,  horizontally bent backwards, in the form of clouds; and on more than  one occasion camels were thrown down by them. It required little  stretch of fancy to enter into the Arabs superstition. These  sand-columns are supposed to be Jinnis of the Waste, which cannot be  caught, a notion arising from the fitful movements of the electrical  wind-eddy that raises them, and as they advance, the pious Moslem  stretches out his finger, exclaiming, Iron! O thou ill-omened one[FN#15]!    During the forenoon we were troubled by the Samum, which, instead of  promoting perspiration, chokes up and hardens the skin. The Arabs  complain greatly of its violence on this line of road. Here I first  remarked the difficulty with which the Badawin bear thirst. Ya Latif,O  Merciful! (Lord),they exclaimed at times; and yet they behaved like  men.[FN#16] I had ordered them to place the    [p.70] water-camel in front, so as to exercise due supervision. Shaykh  Masud and his son made only an occasional reference to the skins. But  his nephew, a short, thin, pock-marked lad of eighteen, whose black  skin and woolly head suggested the idea of a semi-African and ignoble  origin, was always drinking; except when he climbed the camels back,  and, dozing upon the damp load, forgot his thirst. In vain we ordered,  we taunted, and we abused him: he would drink, he would sleep, but he  would not work.    At one P.M. we crossed a Fiumara; and an hour afterwards we pursued the  course of a second. Masud called this the Wady al-Khunak, and assured me  that it runs from the East and the South-east in a North and North-west  direction, to the Madinah plain. Early in the afternoon we reached a  diminutive flat, on the Fiumara bank. Beyond it lies a Mahjar or stony  ground, black as usual in Al-Hijaz, and over its length lay the road,  white with dust and with the sand deposited by the camels feet. Having  arrived before the Pasha, we did not know where to pitch; many opining  that the Caravan would traverse the Mahjar and halt beyond it. We soon  alighted, however, pitched the tent under a burning sun, and were  imitated by the rest of the party. Masud called the place Hijriyah.  According to my computation, it is twenty-five miles from Ghurab, and  its direction is South-East twenty-two degrees.    Late in the afternoon the boy Mohammed started with a dromedary to  procure water from the higher part of the Fiumara. Here are some wells,  still called Bir Harun, after the great Caliph. The youth returned soon  with two bags filled at an expense of nine piastres. This being the  28th Zul Kaadah, many pilgrims busied themselves    [p.71] rather fruitlessly with endeavours to sight the crescent moon.  They failed; but we were consoled by seeing through a gap in the  Western hills a heavy cloud discharge its blessed load, and a cool  night was the result.    We loitered on Sunday, the 4th September, at Al-Hijriyah, although the  Shaykh forewarned us of a long march. But there is a kind of discipline  in these great Caravans. A gun[FN#17] sounds the order to strike the  tents, and a second bids you move off with all speed. There are short  halts, of half an hour each, at dawn, noon, the afternoon, and sunset,  for devotional purposes, and these are regulated by a cannon or a  culverin. At such times the Syrian and Persian servants, who are  admirably expert in their calling, pitch the large green tents, with  gilt crescents, for the dignitaries and their harims. The last  resting-place is known by the hurrying forward of these Farrash, or tent  Lascars, who are determined to be the first on the ground and at the  well. A discharge of three guns denotes the station, and when the  Caravan moves by night a single cannon sounds three or four halts at  irregular intervals. The principal officers were the Emir Hajj, one  Ashgar Ali Pasha, a veteran of whom my companions spoke slightingly,  because he had been the slave of a slave, probably the pipe-bearer of  some grandee who in his youth had been pipe-bearer to some other  grandee. Under him was a Wakil, or lieutenant, who managed the  executive. The Emir al-Surrahcalled simply Al-Surrah, or the Pursehad  charge of the Caravan-treasure, and of remittances to the Holy Cities.  And lastly there was a commander of the    [p.72] forces (Bashat al-Askar): his host consisted of about a thousand  Irregular horsemen, Bash-Buzuks, half bandits, half soldiers, each  habited and armed after his own fashion, exceedingly dirty,  picturesque-looking, brave, and in such a country of no use whatever.    Leaving Al-Hijriyah at seven A.M., we passed over the grim stone-field  by a detestable footpath, and at nine oclock struck into a broad  Fiumara, which runs from the East towards the North-West. Its sandy bed  is overgrown with Acacia, the Senna plant, different species of  Euphorbiae, the wild Capparis, and the Daum Palm. Up this line we  travelled the whole day. About six P.M., we came upon a basin at least  twelve miles broad, which absorbs the water of the adjacent hills.  Accustomed as I have been to mirage, a long thin line of salt  efflorescence appearing at some distance on the plain below us, when  the shades of evening invested the view, completely deceived me. Even  the Arabs were divided in opinion, some thinking it was the effects of  the rain which fell the day before: others were more acute. It is said  that beasts are never deceived by the mirage, and this, as far as my  experience goes, is correct. May not the reason be that most of them  know the vicinity of water rather by smell than by sight? Upon the  horizon beyond the plain rose dark, fort-like masses of rock which I  mistook for buildings, the more readily as the Shaykh had warned me  that we were approaching a populous place. At last descending a long  steep hill, we entered upon the level ground, and discovered our error  by the crunching sound of the camel[s] feet upon large curling flakes of  nitrous salt overlying caked mud.[FN#18] Those civilised birds, the  kite and the crow, warned us that we were in the vicinity of man. It  was not, however, before eleven P.M. that we entered the confines of  Al-Suwayrkiyah. The fact was    [p.73] made patent to us by the stumbling and the falling of our  dromedaries over the little ridges of dried clay disposed in squares  upon the fields. There were other obstacles, such as garden walls,  wells, and hovels, so that midnight had sped before our weary camels  reached the resting-place. A rumour that we were to halt here the next  day, made us think lightly of present troubles; it proved, however, to  be false.    During the last four days I attentively observed the general face of  the country. This line is a succession of low plains and basins, here  quasi-circular, there irregularly oblong, surrounded by rolling hills  and cut by Fiumaras which pass through the higher ground. The basins  are divided by ridges and flats of basalt and greenstone averaging from  one hundred to two hundred feet in height. The general form is a huge  prism; sometimes they are table-topped. From Al-Madinah to  Al-Suwayrkiyah the low beds of sandy Fiumaras abound. From  Al-Suwayrkiyah to Al-Zaribah, their place is taken by Ghadir, or hollows  in which water stagnates. And beyond Al-Zaribah the traveller enters a  region of water-courses tending West and South-West The versant is  generally from the East and South-East towards the West and North-West.  Water obtained by digging is good where rain is fresh in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#14)"],[1,"of living water, but who was now worn out and parched by  the heat of His ardent love, when he could truly say, \"I am poured  out like water,\" and \"My strength is dried up like a potsherd.\" For  not only did He shed all His own blood, and pour out moisture by  tears, but the very marrow of His bones, and all His heart's blood,  were consumed for our sakes by the heat and flame of love. Therefore  He said rightly, \"I thirst.\"    But, secondly, the word may be understood spiritually, as if Christ  said to all men, \"I thirst for your salvation.\" Hence St Bernard  says: \"Jesus cried, I thirst, not, I grieve. O Lord, what dost Thou  thirst for? For your faith, your joy. I thirst because of the  torments of your souls, far more than for My own bodily sufferings.  Have pity on yourselves, if not on Me.\" And again, \"O good Jesus,  Thou wearest the crown of thorns; Thou art silent about Thy Cross  and wounds, yet Thou criest out, I thirst. For what, then, dost Thou  thirst? Truly, for the redemption of mankind only, and for the  felicity of the human race.\" This thirst of Christ was a hundred  times more keen and intense than His natural thirst. And, besides,  He had another sort of thirst--that is to say, a thirst to suffer  more, and to prove to us still more clearly His immeasurable love,  as if He said to man, \"See how I am worn out and exhausted for thy  salvation. See how terrible are the pains and anguish which I  endure. The fierce cruelty of man has almost brought Me to nothing;  the sinners of earth have drunk out all My blood, and yet I thirst.  Not yet is My heart satisfied, nor My desire accomplished, nor the  fire of My love quenched. For if it were possible for Me, and  according to My Father's will, that I should be crucified again a  thousand times for your salvation and conversion, or that I should  hang here, in all this pain and anguish, till the day of judgment, I  would gladly do it, to prove to you the immeasurable love which I  bear you in My heart, and to soften your stony hearts and rouse you  to love Me in return. This is why I hang here so thirsty by the  fountain of your hearts, that I may watch the pious souls who come  hither to draw from the deep well of My Passion. Therefore, the  maiden to whom I shall say, 'Give Me to drink a little water out of  the pitcher of thy conscience'--the water of devotion, pity, tears,  and mutual love--and who shall let down to Me her pitcher, and shall  say, 'Drink, my Lord; and for Thy camels also--that is, Thy  servants, who carry Thee about daily on their bodies, and who by  night and day are held bound fast by Thy yoke, I will draw the water  of brotherly love'--that is the maiden whom the Lord hath prepared  for the Son of My Lord, even the bride of the Word of God, united to  My humanity. And she shall be counted worthy to enter, like a bride  with her bridegroom, into the chamber of eternal rest, when the  Bridegroom invites her, saying, 'Come, My blessed bride, inherit the  Kingdom of My Father. For I was thirsty, and thou gavest Me drink.'\"    Thirdly, we may apply this word to the Father, as if Christ said to  His Father: \"Father, I have declared Thy name to mankind; I have  finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do; and in Thy service I  have spent My whole body as Thine instrument. Behold, I am all worn  out and exhausted; and yet I still thirst to do and suffer more for  Thine honour. This is why I hang here, extended to the furthest  breadth of love, for I long to be an everlasting sacrifice, a sweet  savour to Thee, and at the same time an eternal atonement and  salvation to mankind.\" Thus, too, might this strong Samson have  said: \"O Lord, Thou hast put into the hand of Thy servant this very  great salvation and victory, and yet behold, I die of thirst.\" As if  He would say: \"Father, I have accomplished Thy gracious will; I have  finished the work of man's salvation, as Thou didst demand; and yet  I still thirst; for the sins by which Thou art offended are  infinite. And so I desire that the love and merits of My Passion, by  which Thou wilt be appeased, may be infinite too. And as I now offer  myself as a peace-offering and a living sacrifice for the salvation  of all men, so through Me may all men appease Thee, by offering Me  to Thee as a peace-offering to Thine eternal glory, in memory of My  Passion, and to make good all their shortcomings.\" O how acceptable  to the Father must this desire of love have been! For what was this  thirst but a sweet and pleasant refreshment to the Father, and at  the same time the blessed renovation of mankind? Or what other  language does this burning throat speak to us, save that of Christ's  burning love, without measure and without limit, out of which He did  all His works? This truly is the most noble sacrifice of our  redemption, this is that peace-offering which will be offered even  to the last day, by all good men, to the Holy Ghost, to the highest  Father, in memory of the Son, to the eternal glory of the adorable  Trinity, and to the fruit of salvation for mankind. Here, certainly,  is the inexhaustible storehouse of our reconciliation, which never  fails, for it is greater than all the debts of the world. This is  that immeasurable love, which is higher than the heavens, for it has  repaired the ruin of the angels; deeper than hell, for it has freed  souls from hell; wider and broader than the earth, for it is without  end and incomprehensible by any created understanding. O how keen  and intense was this thirst of our Lord! For not only did He then  say once, \"I thirst,\" but even now He says in our hearts  continually, \"I thirst; woman, give me to drink.\" So great, so  mighty, is that thirst, that He asks drink not only from the  children of Israel, but from the Samaritans. To each one He  complaineth of His thirst. But for what dost Thou thirst, O good  Jesus? \"My meat and drink,\" saith He, \"is that men should do My  Father's will. Now this is the will of My Father, even your  sanctification and salvation, that you may sanctify your souls by  walking in My precepts, by doing works of repentance, by adorning  yourselves with all virtues, in order that, like a bride adorned for  her husband, you may be worthy to be present at My supper in My  Father's kingdom, and to sleep with Me as My elect bride, in the  chamber of My Father's heart.\" O how Christ longs to bring all men  thither! This is the meaning of His words: \"Where I am there shall  also My servant be\"; and again: \"Father, I will that they may be one  even as We are one.\" O, how incomprehensible is this thirst of  Christ! What toil and labour He endured for thirty and three years,  for the sake of it! For this His very heart's blood was poured out.  See what our tender Lord says to His Father: \"The zeal of Thine  house hath even eaten Me.\" Truly, He would have submitted to be  crucified a thousand times, rather than allow one soul to perish  through any fault of His. O how this inward thirst tormented Him,  when He thought that He had done all that He could, and even a  hundredfold more than He need have done, and yet that so few had  turned to Him, and been won by Him. His whole body was now worn out;  all His blood was shed; nothing remained for Him to do; and  therefore He was constrained to confess, \"It is finished\"; and yet  by all His labours, afflictions, and sufferings, He had brought no  richer harvest to the Father than this. Truly, this was the most  bitter of all His sorrows, that after so hard a battle His victory  had not been more glorious, and that He returned a conqueror to His  Father with so few spoils. Therefore, all those who do not refresh  Him by performing His will, and doing all that is pleasing and  honourable to Him, and withstanding all that reason tells them to be  displeasing to Him, will one day hear Him say, \"I was thirsty, and  ye gave Me no drink. Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.\"    Fourthly, there is yet another inward meaning of this word--namely,  that Christ spoke it out of the love which inwardly draws Him  towards all men, thus making known to us His ardent love, and  opening His own heart, as a delightful couch, on which we may feed  pleasantly, and inviting us to it, saying, \"I thirst for you.\" For  as the liquid which we drink is sent down pleasantly through the  throat into the body, and so passes into the substance and nature of  our body, so Christ out of the ardent thirst of His love, takes  spiritual pleasure in drinking in all men into Himself, swallowing  them, as it were, and incorporating them into Himself, and bringing  them into the secret chamber of His loving heart. Therefore He says:  \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto  Me\"--all men, that is, who allow themselves to be drawn by Me, and  submit to Me as obedient instruments, suffering Me to do with them  according to My gracious will. But those who resist Him quench not  His thirst, but give Him a bitter draught instead, even the deeds of  their own self-will. These, when our Lord tasteth them, He  straightway rejects.    THE SIXTH WORD    WHEN Christ had tasted the draught of vinegar and gall, He spoke the  sixth word: \"It is finished.\" Thereby He signified that by His  Passion had been fulfilled all the prophecies, types, mysteries,  scriptures, sacrifices, and promises, which had been predicted and  written about Him. This is that true Son of God, for whom the Father  of heaven made ready a supper in the kingdom of His eternal  blessedness; and He sent His servant--that is the human nature of  Christ, coming in the form of a servant, to call them that were  bidden to the wedding. For Christ, when He took human nature upon  Him, was not only a servant but a servant of servants, and served  all of us for thirty and three years with great toil and suffering.  Indeed, He spent His whole life in bidding all men to His supper. It  was for this that He preached, and wrought miracles,"]]]
