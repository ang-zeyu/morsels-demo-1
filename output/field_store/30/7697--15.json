Nevertheless. Voltaire's signal characteristic was his  lucidity, his negative lucidity.    There was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the  eighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into  France; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity  which the French had. Its bent was toward other things in preference.  Our leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which  distinguished Voltaire. In their free inquiry they soon found themselves  coming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,  conventions. Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to  sway them. The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned  their eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and  the light. \"It seems highly probable,\" said Voltaire, \"that nature has  made thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of  trees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet.\" So our  reason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not  assure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he  did not venture to announce it. The French Revolution came, England grew  to abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,  gained much, but not in lucidity. The Continent was reopened, the  century advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of  free and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among  us. But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the  reign of lucidity.    Let them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just  now: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations. They would  see numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and  a total absence of lucidity. A little lucidity would make the whole  movement impossible. That movement took for granted as its basis what  was no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all  they did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and  neither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking  themselves whether it was solid or not.    Taking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and  import, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,  laborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr. Pusey, which had just  ended. Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that  acute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr. Mozley, an account of  that great movement which took from Dr. Pusey its earlier name. Of its  later stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated  experience. This movement was full of interest. It had produced men to  be respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,  goodness, genius, and charm. But could they resist the truth that  lucidity would have been fatal to it? The movers of all those questions  about apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive  usage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on  which he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by  taking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on  this basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their  basis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?    He would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory  possession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and  that it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.  Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and  spiritually all abroad. If they saw it accompanied in France by much  that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would  have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural  seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their  love for the past. Come it must; and here where it had been so late in  coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without  danger.    Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for  the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,  and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often  they had it not. To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,  and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged  in business, was more difficult. Schools and universities, with serious  and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the  other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the  best agency they could use. It might be slow, but it was sure. Such  an agency they were now going to employ. Might it fulfill all their  expectations! Might their students, in the words quoted just now,  advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that  conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_! And among the many  good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst  of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!           *       *       *       *       *          ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.    [Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]      In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate  under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed  amid flames. These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the  twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic. They are,  I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest  for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.    At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a  very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a  point that it could not traverse the meshes. This phenomenon, which he  attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon  utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.    Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of  making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an  envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.  This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch  meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with  mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal  bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt  for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots  formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one  and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron  frame. Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a  close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution  of alum. The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos  cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter. The bonnet  contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a  single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of  double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with  the hands.    Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to  humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with  it. The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini  began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double  layer of wire gauze. He then held it for some instants in the flame of  a candle or alcohol lamp. One of his assistants afterward put on the  asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his  hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot  iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or  fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to  the furnace. On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands  in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which  fagots were burning.    In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the  wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos  bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his  breast. Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a  great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.  Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head  and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.  In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic  des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,  connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave  between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long. The heat was so intense,  when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than  20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between  them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet. Six men clad in the Aldini  suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and  walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire  was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior. One of these  men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a  child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos  bonnet. This same man, having the child with him, entered on another  occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and  whose intensity was such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8564"],[0,"Life and Travels of Mungo Park (#14)"],[1,"dour, and are used by the Mandingoes for perfuming their huts and  clothes.    The customs, or duties on travellers, are very heavy; in almost every  town an ass-load pays a bar of European merchandize; and at Fatteconda,  the residence of the king, one Indian baft, or a musket, and six bottles  of gunpowder, are exacted as a common tribute. By means of these duties,  the King of Bondou is well supplied with arms and ammunition; a  circumstance which makes him formidable to the neighbouring states.    The inhabitants differ in their complexions and national manners from the  Mandingoes and Serawoollies, with whom they are frequently at war. Some  years ago the King of Bondou crossed the Faleme river with a numerous  army, and after a short and bloody campaign, totally defeated the forces  of Samboo,    King of Bambouk, who was obliged to sue for peace, and surrender to him  all the towns along the eastern bank of the Faleme.    The Foulahs, in general, (as has been observed in a former chapter,) are  of a tawny complexion, with small features, and soft silky hair; next to  the Mandingoes they are undoubtedly the most considerable of all the  nations in this part of Africa. Their original country is said to be  Fooladoo, (which signifies the country of the Foulahs,) but they possess  at present many other kingdoms at a great distance from each other; their  complexion, however, is not exactly the same in the different districts;  in Bondou, and the other kingdoms which are situated in the vicinity of  the Moorish territories, they are of a more yellow complexion than in the  southern states.    The Foulahs of Bondou are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, but  the uncharitable maxims of the Koran have made them less hospitable to  strangers, and more reserved in their behaviour than the Mandingoes. They  evidently consider all the Negro natives as their inferiors; and when  talking of different nations, always rank themselves among the white  people.    Their government differs from that of the Mandingoes chiefly in this,  that they are more immediately under the influence of the Mahomedan laws;  for all the chief men, (the king excepted,) and a large majority of the  inhabitants of Bondou, are Mussulmen, and the authority and laws of the  Prophet are every where looked upon as sacred and decisive. In the  exercise of their faith, however, they are not very intolerant towards  such of their countrymen as still retain their ancient superstitions.  Religious persecution is not known among them, nor is it necessary; for  the system of Mahomet is made to extend itself by means abundantly more  efficacious. By establishing small schools in the different towns, where  many of the Pagan as well as Mahomedan children are taught to read the  Koran, and instructed in the tenets of the Prophet, the Mahomedan priests  fix a bias on the minds, and form the character of their young disciples,  which no accidents of life can ever afterwards remove or alter. Many of  these little schools I visited in my progress through the country, and  observed with pleasure the great docility and submissive deportment of  the children, and heartily wished they had had better instructors, and a  purer religion.    With the Mahomedan faith is also introduced the Arabic language, with  which most of the Foulahs have a slight acquaintance. The native tongue  abounds very much in liquids, but there is something unpleasant in the  manner of pronouncing it. A stranger, on hearing the common conversation  of two Foulahs, would imagine that they were scolding each other. Their  numerals are these:--        One   ......... _Go_.      Two   ......... _Deeddee_.      Three ......... _Tettee_.      Four  ......... _Nee_.      Five  ......... _Jouee_.      Six   ......... _Jego_.      Seven ......... _Jedeeddee_.      Eight ......... _Je Tettee_.      Nine  ......... _Je Nee_.      Ten   ......... _Sappo_.    The industry of the Foulahs, in the occupations of pasturage and  agriculture, is everywhere remarkable. Even on the banks of the Gambia,  the greater part of the corn is raised by them; and their herds and  flocks are more numerous and in better condition than those of the  Mandingoes; but in Bondou they are opulent in a high degree, and enjoy  all the necessaries of life in the greatest profusion. They display great  skill in the management of their cattle, making them extremely gentle by  kindness and familiarity. On the approach of night, they are collected  from the woods, and secured in folds, called korrees, which are  constructed in the neighbourhood of the different villages. In the middle  of each korree is erected a small hut, wherein one or two of the herdsmen  keep watch during the night, to prevent the cattle from being stolen, and  to keep up the fires which are kindled round the korree to frighten away  the wild beasts.    The cattle are milked in the mornings and evenings; the milk is  excellent, but the quantity obtained from any one cow is by no means so  great as in Europe. The Foulahs use the milk chiefly as an article of  diet, and that not until it is quite sour. The cream which it affords is  very thick, and is converted into butter by stirring it violently in a  large calabash. This butter, when melted over a gentle fire, and freed  from impurities, is preserved in small earthen pots, and forms a part in  most of their dishes; it serves likewise to anoint their heads, and is  bestowed very liberally on their faces and arms.    But although milk is plentiful, it is somewhat remarkable that the  Foulahs, and indeed all the inhabitants of this part of Africa, are  totally unacquainted with the art of making cheese. A firm attachment to  the customs of their ancestors makes them view with an eye of prejudice  every thing that looks like innovation. The heat of the climate, and the  great scarcity of salt, are held forth as unanswerable objections: and  the whole process appears to them too long and troublesome to be attended  with any solid advantage.    Besides the cattle, which constitute the chief wealth of the Foulahs,  they possess some excellent horses, the breed of which seems to be a  mixture of the Arabian with the original African.        CHAPTER V.    _Account of Kajaaga.--Serawoollies--their manners and language.--Account  of Joag.--The Author is ill treated, and robbed of half of his effects,  by order of Batcheri, the king.--Charity of a female slave.--The Author  is visited by Demba Sego, nephew of the King of Kasson, who offers to  conduct him in safety to that kingdom.--Offer accepted.--The Author and  his protector, with a numerous retinue, set out and reach Samee, on the  banks of the Senegal.--Proceed to Kayee, and, crossing the Senegal,  arrive in the kingdom of Kasson._      The kingdom of Kajaaga, in which I was now arrived, is called by the  French Gallam; but the name that I have adopted is universally used by  the natives. This country is bounded on the south-east and south by  Bambouk; on the west by Bondou and Foota Torra; and on the north by the  river Senegal.    The air and climate are, I believe, more pure and salubrious than at any  of the settlements towards the coast; the face of the country is  everywhere interspersed with a pleasing variety of hills and valleys; and  the windings of the Senegal river, which descends from the rocky hills of  the interior, make the scenery on its banks very picturesque and  beautiful.    The inhabitants are called Serawoollies, or (as the French write it)  _Seracolets_. Their complexion is a jet black: they are not to be  distinguished in this respect from the Jaloffs. The government is  monarchical; and the regal authority, from what I experienced of it,  seems to be sufficiently formidable. The people themselves, however,  complain of no oppression; and seemed all very anxious to support the  king in a contest he was going to enter into with the sovereign of  Kasson. The Serawoollies are habitually a trading people; they formerly  carried on a great commerce with the French in gold and slaves, and still  maintain some traffic in slaves with the British factories on the Gambia.  They are reckoned tolerably fair and just in their dealings, but are  indefatigable in their exertions to acquire wealth, and they derive  considerable profits by the sale of salt and cotton cloth in distant  countries. When a Serawoolli merchant returns home from a trading  expedition, the neighbours immediately assemble to congratulate him upon  his arrival. On these occasions the traveller displays his wealth and  liberality, by making a few presents to his friends; but if he has been  unsuccessful, his levee is soon over; and every one looks upon him as a  man of no understanding, who could perform a long journey, and (as they  express it) _bring back nothing but the hair upon his head_.    Their language abounds much in gutterals, and is not so harmonious as  that spoken by the Foulahs; it is, however, well worth acquiring by those  who travel through this part of the African continent, it being very  generally understood in the kingdoms of Kasson, Kaarta, Ludamar, and the  northern parts of Bambarra. In all these countries the Serawoollies are  the chief traders. Their numerals are:--        One   ......... _Bani_.      Two   ......... _Fillo_.      Three ......... _Sicco_.      Four  ......... _Narrato_.      Five  ......... _Karrago_.      Six   ......... _Toomo_.      Seven ......... _Nero_.      Eight ......... _Sego_.      Nine  ......... _Kabbo_.      Ten   ......... _Tamo_.      Twenty......... _Tamo di fillo_.    We arrived at Joag, the frontier town of this kingdom, on the 24th of  December; and took up our residence at the house of the chief man, who is  here no longer known by the title of _Alkaid_, but is called the _Dooty_.  He was a rigid Mahomedan, but distinguished for his hospitality. This  town may be supposed, on a gross computation, to contain two"]]]
