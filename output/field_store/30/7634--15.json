[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#14)"],[1,"'ve drawn Seymour's in the next round of the house-matches. I  suppose you knew. I want to get it over before the Ripton match, for  several reasons. About half the fifteen are playing on one side or the  other, and it'll give them a good chance of getting fit. Running and  passing is all right, but a good, hard game's the thing for putting you  into form. And then I was thinking that, as the side that loses,  whichever it is--\"    \"Seymour's, of course.\"    \"Hope so. Well, they're bound to be a bit sick at losing, so they'll  play up all the harder on Saturday to console themselves for losing the  cup.\"    \"My word, what strategy!\" said Clowes. \"You think of everything. When  do you think of playing it, then?\"    \"Wednesday struck me as a good day. Don't you think so?\"    \"It would do splendidly. It'll be a good match. For all practical  purposes, of course, it's the final. If we beat Seymour's, I don't  think the others will trouble us much.\"    There was just time to see Milton before lock-up. Trevor ran across to  Seymour's, and went up to his study.    \"Come in,\" said Milton, in answer to his knock.    Trevor went in, and stood surprised at the difference in the look of  the place since the last time he had visited it. The walls, once  covered with photographs, were bare. Milton, seated before the fire,  was ruefully contemplating what looked like a heap of waste cardboard.    Trevor recognised the symptoms. He had had experience.    \"You don't mean to say they've been at you, too!\" he cried.    Milton's normally cheerful face was thunderous and gloomy.    \"Yes. I was thinking what I'd like to do to the man who ragged it.\"    \"It's the League again, I suppose?\"    Milton looked surprised.    \"_Again?_\" he said, \"where did _you_ hear of the League?  This is the first time I've heard of its existence, whatever it is.  What is the confounded thing, and why on earth have they played the  fool here? What's the meaning of this bally rot?\"    He exhibited one of the variety of cards of which Trevor had already  seen two specimens. Trevor explained briefly the style and nature of  the League, and mentioned that his study also had been wrecked.    \"Your study? Why, what have they got against you?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Trevor. Nothing was to be gained by speaking of  the letters he had received.    \"Did they cut up your photographs?\"    \"Every one.\"    \"I tell you what it is, Trevor, old chap,\" said Milton, with great  solemnity, \"there's a lunatic in the school. That's what I make of it.  A lunatic whose form of madness is wrecking studies.\"    \"But the same chap couldn't have done yours and mine. It must have been  a Donaldson's fellow who did mine, and one of your chaps who did yours  and Mill's.\"    \"Mill's? By Jove, of course. I never thought of that. That was the  League, too, I suppose?\"    \"Yes. One of those cards was tied to a chair, but Clowes took it away  before anybody saw it.\"    Milton returned to the details of the disaster.    \"Was there any ink spilt in your room?\"    \"Pints,\" said Trevor, shortly. The subject was painful.    \"So there was here,\" said Milton, mournfully. \"Gallons.\"    There was silence for a while, each pondering over his wrongs.    \"Gallons,\" said Milton again. \"I was ass enough to keep a large pot  full of it here, and they used it all, every drop. You never saw such a  sight.\"    Trevor said he had seen one similar spectacle.    \"And my photographs! You remember those photographs I showed you? All  ruined. Slit across with a knife. Some torn in half. I wish I knew who  did that.\"    Trevor said he wished so, too.    \"There was one of Mrs Patrick Campbell,\" Milton continued in  heartrending tones, \"which was torn into sixteen pieces. I counted  them. There they are on the mantelpiece. And there was one of Little  Tich\" (here he almost broke down), \"which was so covered with ink that  for half an hour I couldn't recognise it. Fact.\"    Trevor nodded sympathetically.    \"Yes,\" said Milton. \"Soaked.\"    There was another silence. Trevor felt it would be almost an outrage to  discuss so prosaic a topic as the date of a house-match with one so  broken up. Yet time was flying, and lock-up was drawing near.    \"Are you willing to play--\" he began.    \"I feel as if I could never play again,\" interrupted Milton. \"You'd  hardly believe the amount of blotting-paper I've used today. It must  have been a lunatic, Dick, old man.\"    When Milton called Trevor \"Dick\", it was a sign that he was moved. When  he called him \"Dick, old man\", it gave evidence of an internal upheaval  without parallel.    \"Why, who else but a lunatic would get up in the night to wreck another  chap's study? All this was done between eleven last night and seven  this morning. I turned in at eleven, and when I came down here again at  seven the place was a wreck. It must have been a lunatic.\"    \"How do you account for the printed card from the League?\"    Milton murmured something about madmen's cunning and diverting  suspicion, and relapsed into silence. Trevor seized the opportunity to  make the proposal he had come to make, that Donaldson's _v._  Seymour's should be played on the following Wednesday.    Milton agreed listlessly.    \"Just where you're standing,\" he said, \"I found a photograph of Sir  Henry Irving so slashed about that I thought at first it was Huntley  Wright in _San Toy_.\"    \"Start at two-thirty sharp,\" said Trevor.    \"I had seventeen of Edna May,\" continued the stricken Seymourite,  monotonously. \"In various attitudes. All destroyed.\"    \"On the first fifteen ground, of course,\" said Trevor. \"I'll get  Aldridge to referee. That'll suit you, I suppose?\"    \"All right. Anything you like. Just by the fireplace I found the  remains of Arthur Roberts in _H.M.S. Irresponsible_. And part of  Seymour Hicks. Under the table--\"    Trevor departed.          XIV    THE WHITE FIGURE      \"Suppose,\" said Shoeblossom to Barry, as they were walking over to  school on the morning following the day on which Milton's study had  passed through the hands of the League, \"suppose you thought somebody  had done something, but you weren't quite certain who, but you knew it  was some one, what would you do?\"    \"What on _earth_ do you mean?\" inquired Barry.    \"I was trying to make an A.B. case of it,\" explained Shoeblossom.    \"What's an A.B. case?\"    \"I don't know,\" admitted Shoeblossom, frankly. \"But it comes in a book  of Stevenson's. I think it must mean a sort of case where you call  everyone A. and B. and don't tell their names.\"    \"Well, go ahead.\"    \"It's about Milton's study.\"    \"What! what about it?\"    \"Well, you see, the night it was ragged I was sitting in my study with  a dark lantern--\"    \"What!\"    Shoeblossom proceeded to relate the moving narrative of his  night-walking adventure. He dwelt movingly on his state of mind  when standing behind the door, waiting for Mr Seymour to come in  and find him. He related with appropriate force the hair-raising  episode of the weird white figure. And then he came to the conclusions  he had since drawn (in calmer moments) from that apparition's movements.    \"You see,\" he said, \"I saw it coming out of Milton's study, and that  must have been about the time the study was ragged. And it went into  Rigby's dorm. So it must have been a chap in that dorm, who did it.\"    Shoeblossom was quite clever at rare intervals. Even Barry, whose  belief in his sanity was of the smallest, was compelled to admit that  here, at any rate, he was talking sense.    \"What would you do?\" asked Shoeblossom.    \"Tell Milton, of course,\" said Barry.    \"But he'd give me beans for being out of the dorm, after lights-out.\"    This was a distinct point to be considered. The attitude of Barry  towards Milton was different from that of Shoeblossom. Barry regarded  him--through having played with him in important matches--as a good  sort of fellow who had always behaved decently to him. Leather-Twigg,  on the other hand, looked on him with undisguised apprehension, as one  in authority who would give him lines the first time he came into  contact with him, and cane him if he ever did it again. He had a  decided disinclination to see Milton on any pretext whatever.    \"Suppose I tell him?\" suggested Barry.    \"You'll keep my name dark?\" said Shoeblossom, alarmed.    Barry said he would make an A.B. case of it.    After school he went to Milton's study, and found him still brooding  over its departed glories.    \"I say, Milton, can I speak to you for a second?\"    \"Hullo, Barry. Come in.\"    Barry came in.    \"I had forty-three photographs,\" began Milton, without preamble. \"All  destroyed. And I've no money to buy any more. I had seventeen of Edna  May.\"    Barry, feeling that he was expected to say something, said, \"By Jove!  Really?\"    \"In various positions,\" continued Milton. \"All ruined.\"    \"Not really?\" said Barry.    \"There was one of Little Tich--\"    But Barry felt unequal to playing the part of chorus any longer. It was  all very thrilling, but, if Milton was going to run through the entire  list of his destroyed photographs, life would be too short for  conversation on any other topic.    \"I say, Milton,\" he said, \"it was about that that I came. I'm sorry--\"    Milton sat up.    \"It wasn't you who did this, was it?\"    \"No, no,\" said Barry, hastily.    \"Oh, I thought from your saying you were sorry--\"    \"I was going to say I thought I could put you on the track of the chap  who did do it--\"    For the second time since the interview began Milton sat up.    \"Go on,\" he said.    \"--But I'm sorry I can't give you the name of the fellow who told me  about it.\"    \"That doesn't matter,\" said Milton. \"Tell me the name of the fellow who  did it. That'll satisfy me.\"    \"I'm afraid I can't do that, either.\"    \"Have you any idea what you _can_ do?\" asked Milton, satirically.    \"I can tell you something which may put you on the right track.\"    \"That'll do for a start. Well?\"    \"Well, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#14)"],[1,"very existence both of Adel and Abyssinia; and  considering the vigorous government of the one, and the weak politics and  prejudices of the other, it is more than probable that the Turks would  have subdued both, had they not in India, their chief object, met the  Portuguese, strongly established.    Bartema, travelling in A.D. 1503, treats in his 15th chapter of \"Zeila in  AEthiopia and the great fruitlessness thereof, and of certain strange  beasts seen there.\"    \"In this city is great frequentation of merchandise, as in a most famous  mart. There is marvellous abundance of gold and iron, and an innumerable  number of black slaves sold for small prices; these are taken in War by  the Mahomedans out of AEthiopia, of the kingdom of Presbyter Johannes, or  Preciosus Johannes, which some also call the king of Jacobins or Abyssins,  being a Christian; and are carried away from thence into Persia, Arabia  Felix, Babylonia of Nilus or Alcair, and Meccah. In this city justice and  good laws are observed. [12] ... It hath an innumerable multitude of  merchants; the walls are greatly decayed, and the haven rude and  despicable. The King or Sultan of the city is a Mahomedan, and  entertaineth in wages a great multitude of footmen and horsemen. They are  greatly given to war, and wear only one loose single vesture: they are of  dark ash colour, inclining to black.\"    In July 1516 Zayla was taken, and the town burned by a Portuguese  armament, under Lopez Suarez Alberguiera. When the Turks were compelled  to retire from Southern Arabia, it became subject to the Prince of Senaa,  who gave it in perpetuity to the family of a Senaani merchant.    The kingdom of Yemen falling into decay, Zayla passed under the authority  of the Sherif of Mocha, who, though receiving no part of the revenue, had  yet the power of displacing the Governor. By him it was farmed out to the  Hajj Sharmarkay, who paid annually to Sayyid Mohammed el Barr, at Mocha,  the sum of 750 crowns, and reserved all that he could collect above that  sum for himself. In A.D. 1848 Zayla was taken from the family El Barr, and  farmed out to Sharmarkay by the Turkish Governor of Mocha and Hodaydah.    The extant remains at Saad el Din are principally those of water-courses,  rude lines of coralline, stretching across the plain towards wells, now  lost [13], and diminutive tanks, made apparently to collect rain water.  One of these latter is a work of some art--a long sunken vault, with a  pointed arch projecting a few feet above the surface of the ground;  outside it is of rough stone, the interior is carefully coated with fine  lime, and from the roof long stalactites depend. Near it is a cemetery:  the graves are, for the most part, provided with large slabs of close  black basalt, planted in the ground edgeways, and in the shape of a small  oblong. The material was most probably brought from the mountains near  Tajurrah: at another part of the island I found it in the shape of a  gigantic mill-stone, half imbedded in the loose sand. Near the cemetery we  observed a mound of rough stones surrounding an upright pole; this is the  tomb of Shaykh Saad el Din, formerly the hero, now the favourite patron  saint of Zayla,--still popularly venerated, as was proved by the remains  of votive banquets, broken bones, dried garbage, and stones blackened by  the fire.    After wandering through the island, which contained not a human being save  a party of Somal boatmen, cutting firewood for Aden, and having massacred  a number of large fishing hawks and small sea-birds, to astonish the  natives, our companions, we returned to the landing-place. Here an awning  had been spread; the goat destined for our dinner--I have long since  conquered all dislike, dear L., to seeing dinner perambulating--had been  boiled and disposed in hunches upon small mountains of rice, and jars of  sweet water stood in the air to cool. After feeding, regardless of  Quartana and her weird sisterhood, we all lay down for siesta in the light  sea-breeze. Our slumbers were heavy, as the Zayla people say is ever the  case at Saad el Din, and the sun had declined low ere we awoke. The tide  was out, and we waded a quarter of a mile to the boat, amongst giant crabs  who showed grisly claws, sharp coralline, and sea-weed so thick as to  become almost a mat. You must believe me when I tell you that in the  shallower parts the sun was painfully hot, even to my well tried feet. We  picked up a few specimens of fine sponge, and coral, white and red, which,  if collected, might be valuable to Zayla, and, our pic-nic concluded, we  returned home.    On the 14th November we left the town to meet a caravan of the Danakil  [14], and to visit the tomb of the great saint Abu Zarbay. The former  approached in a straggling line of asses, and about fifty camels laiden  with cows' hides, ivories and one Abyssinian slave-girl. The men were wild  as ourang-outangs, and the women fit only to flog cattle: their animals  were small, meagre-looking, and loosely made; the asses of the Bedouins,  however, are far superior to those of Zayla, and the camels are,  comparatively speaking, well bred. [15] In a few minutes the beasts were  unloaded, the Gurgis or wigwams pitched, and all was prepared for repose.  A caravan so extensive being an unusual event,--small parties carrying  only grain come in once or twice a week,--the citizens abandoned even  their favourite game of ball, with an eye to speculation. We stood at  \"Government House,\" over the Ashurbara Gate, to see the Bedouins, and we  quizzed (as Town men might denounce a tie or scoff at a boot) the huge  round shields and the uncouth spears of these provincials. Presently they  entered the streets, where we witnessed their frantic dance in presence of  the Hajj and other authorities. This is the wild men's way of expressing  their satisfaction that Fate has enabled them to convoy the caravan  through all the dangers of the desert.    The Shaykh Ibrahim Abu Zarbay [16] lies under a whitewashed dome close to  the Ashurbara Gate of Zayla: an inscription cut in wood over the doorway  informs us that the building dates from A.H. 1155=AD. 1741-2. It is now  dilapidated, the lintel is falling in, the walls are decaying, and the  cupola, which is rudely built, with primitive gradients,--each step  supported as in Cashmere and other parts of India, by wooden beams,--  threatens the heads of the pious. The building is divided into two  compartments, forming a Mosque and a Mazar or place of pious visitation:  in the latter are five tombs, the two largest covered with common chintz  stuff of glaring colours. Ibrahim was one of the forty-four Hazrami saints  who landed at Berberah, sat in solemn conclave upon Auliya Kumbo or Holy  Hill, and thence dispersed far and wide for the purpose of propagandism.  He travelled to Harar about A.D. 1430 [17], converted many to El Islam,  and left there an honored memory. His name is immortalised in El Yemen by  the introduction of El Kat. [17]    Tired of the town, I persuaded the Hajj to send me with an escort to the  Hissi or well. At daybreak I set out with four Arab matchlock-men, and  taking a direction nearly due west, waded and walked over an alluvial  plain flooded by every high tide. On our way we passed lines of donkeys  and camels carrying water-skins from the town; they were under guard like  ourselves, and the sturdy dames that drove them indulged in many a loud  joke at our expense. After walking about four miles we arrived at what is  called the Takhushshah--the sandy bed of a torrent nearly a mile broad  [19], covered with a thin coat of caked mud: in the centre is a line of  pits from three to four feet deep, with turbid water at the bottom. Around  them were several frame-works of four upright sticks connected by  horizontal bars, and on these were stretched goats'-skins, forming the  cattle-trough of the Somali country. About the wells stood troops of  camels, whose Eesa proprietors scowled fiercely at us, and stalked over  the plain with their long, heavy spears: for protection against these  people, the citizens have erected a kind of round tower, with a ladder for  a staircase. Near it are some large tamarisks and the wild henna of the  Somali country, which supplies a sweet-smelling flower, but is valueless  as a dye. A thick hedge of thorn-trees surrounds the only cultivated  ground near Zayla: as Ibn Said declared in old times, \"the people have no  gardens, and know nothing of fruits.\" The variety and the luxuriance of  growth, however, prove that industry is the sole desideratum. I remarked  the castor-plant,--no one knows its name or nature [20],--the Rayhan or  Basil, the Kadi, a species of aloe, whose strongly scented flowers the  Arabs of Yemen are fond of wearing in their turbans. [21] Of vegetables,  there were cucumbers, egg-plants, and the edible hibiscus; the only fruit  was a small kind of water-melon.    After enjoying a walk through the garden and a bath at the well, I  started, gun in hand, towards the jungly plain that stretches towards the  sea. It abounds in hares, and in a large description of spur-fowl [22];  the beautiful little sand antelope, scarcely bigger than an English rabbit  [23], bounded over the bushes, its thin legs being scarcely perceptible  during the spring. I was afraid to fire with ball, the place being full of  Bedouins' huts, herds, and dogs, and the vicinity of man made the animals  too wild for small shot. In revenge, I did considerable havoc amongst the  spur-fowl, who proved equally good for sport and the pot, besides knocking  over a number of old crows, whose gall the Arab soldiers wanted for  collyrium. [24] Beyond us lay Warabalay or Hyaenas' hill [25]: we did not  visit it, as all its tenants had been driven away by the migration of the  Nomads.    Returning, we breakfasted in the garden, and rain coming on, we walked out  to enjoy the Oriental luxury of a wetting. Ali"]]]
