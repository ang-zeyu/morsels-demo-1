Foolish folks, such as  stupid maid-servants, and dull-witted fellows, that blunder a good deal,  declare that the Onis made them do it. Drunken men, especially, that  stumble into mud-holes at night, say the Onis pushed them in. Naughty  boys that steal cake, and girls that take sugar, often tell fibs to  their parents, charging it on the Onis.    The Onis love to play jokes on people, but they are not dangerous. There  are plenty of pictures of them in Japan, though they never sat for their  portraits, but this is the way they looked.    Some Onis have only one eye in their forehead, others two, and, once in  a while, a big fellow has three. There are little, short horns on their  heads, but these are no bigger than those on a baby deer and never grow  long. The hair on their heads gets all snarled up, just like a little  girl's that cries when her tangled tresses are combed out; for the Onis  make use of neither brushes nor looking glasses. As for their faces,  they never wash them, so they look sooty. Their skin is rough, like an  elephant's. On each of their feet are only three toes. Whether an Oni  has a nose, or a snout, is not agreed upon by the learned men who have  studied them.    No one ever heard of an Oni being higher than a yardstick, but they are  so strong that one of them can easily lift two bushel bags of rice at  once. In Japan, they steal the food offered to the idols. They can live  without air. They like nothing better than to drink both the rice spirit  called sak√©, and the black liquid called soy, of which only a few drops,  as a sauce on fish, are enough for a man. Of this sauce, the Dutch, as  well as the Japanese, are very fond.    Above all things else, the most fun for a young Oni is to get into a  crockery shop. Once there, he jumps round among the cups and dishes,  hides in the jars, straddles the shelves and turns somersaults over the  counter. In fact, the Oni is only a jolly little imp. The Japanese  girls, on New Year's eve, throw handfuls of dried beans in every room of  the house and cry, \"In, with good luck; and out with you, Onis!\" Yet  they laugh merrily all the time. The Onis cannot speak, but they can  chatter like monkeys. They often seem to be talking to each other in  gibberish.    Now it once happened in Japan that the great Tycoon of the country  wanted to make a present to the Prince of the Dutch. So he sent all over  the land, from the sweet potato fields in the south to the seal and  salmon waters in the north, to get curiosities of all sorts. The  products of Japan, from the warm parts, where grow the indigo and the  sugar cane, to the cold regions, in which are the bear and walrus, were  sent as gifts to go to the Land of Dykes and Windmills. The Japanese had  heard that the Dutch people like cheese, walk in wooden shoes, eat with  forks, instead of chopsticks, and the women wear twenty petticoats  apiece, while the men sport jackets with two gold buttons, and folks  generally do things the other way from that which was common in Japan.    Now it chanced that while they were packing the things that were piled  up in the palace at Yedo, a young Oni, with his horns only half grown,  crawled into the kitchen, at night, through the big bamboo water pipe  near the pump. Pretty soon he jumped into the storeroom. There, the  precious cups, vases, lacquer boxes, pearl-inlaid pill-holders, writing  desks, jars of tea, and bales of silk, were lying about, ready to be put  into their cases. The yellow wrappings for covering the pretty things of  gold and silver, bronze and wood, and the rice chaff, for the packing of  the porcelain, were all at hand. What a jolly time the Oni did have, in  tumbling them about and rolling over them! Then he leaped like a monkey  from one vase to another. He put on a lady's gay silk kimono and wrapped  himself around with golden embroidery. Then he danced and played the  game of the Ka-gu'-ra, or Lion of Korea, pretending to make love to a  girl-Oni. Such funny capers as he did cut! It would have made a cat  laugh to see him. It was broad daylight, before his pranks were over,  and the Dutch church chimes were playing the hour of seven.    Suddenly the sound of keys in the lock told him that, in less than a  minute, the door would open.    Where should he hide? There was no time to be lost. So he seized some  bottles of soy from the kitchen shelf and then jumped into the big  bottom drawer of a ladies' cabinet, and pulled it shut.    \"Namu Amida\" (Holy Buddha!), cried the man that opened the door. \"Who  has been here? It looks like a rat's picnic.\"    However, the workmen soon came and set everything to rights. Then they  packed up the pretty things. They hammered down the box lids and before  night the Japanese curiosities were all stored in the hold of a swift,  Dutch ship, from Nagasaki, bound for Rotterdam. After a long voyage, the  vessel arrived safely in good season, and the boxes were sent on to The  Hague, or capital city. As the presents were for the Prince, they were  taken at once to the pretty palace, called the House in the Wood. There  they were unpacked and set on exhibition for the Prince and Princess to  see the next day.    When the palace maid came in next morning to clean up the floor and dust  the various articles, her curiosity led her to pull open the drawer of  the ladies' cabinet; when out jumped something hairy. It nearly  frightened the girl out of her wits. It was the Oni, which rushed off  and down stairs, tumbling over a half dozen servants, who were sitting  at their breakfast. All started to run except the brave butler, who  caught up a carving knife and showed fight. Seeing this, the Oni ran  down into the cellar, hoping to find some hole or crevice for escape.  All around, were shelves filled with cheeses, jars of sour-krout,  pickled herring, and stacks of fresh rye bread standing in the corners.  But oh! how they did smell in his Japanese nostrils! Oni, as he was, he  nearly fainted, for no such odors had ever beaten upon his nose, when in  Japan. Even at the risk of being carved into bits, he must go back. So  up into the kitchen again he ran. Happily, the door into the garden  stood wide open.    Grabbing a fresh bottle of soy from the kitchen shelf, the Oni, with a  hop, skip and jump, reached outdoors. Seeing a pair of klomps, or wooden  shoes, near the steps, the Oni put his pair of three toes into them, to  keep the dogs from scenting its tracks. Then he ran into the fields,  hiding among the cows, until he heard men with pitchforks coming. At  once the Oni leaped upon a cow's back and held on to its horns, while  the poor animal ran for its life into its stall, in the cow stable,  hoping to brush the monster off.    The dairy farmer's wife was at that moment pulling open her bureau  drawer, to put on a new clean lace cap. Hearing her favorite cow moo and  bellow, she left the drawer open and ran to look through the pane of  glass in the kitchen. Through this, she could peep, at any minute, to  see whether this or that cow, or its calf, was sick or well.    Meanwhile, at the House in the Wood, the Princess, hearing the maid  scream and the servants in an uproar, rushed out in her embroidered  white nightie, to ask who, and what, and why, and wherefore. All  different and very funny were the answers of maid, butler, cook, valet  and boots.    The first maid, who had pulled open the drawer and let the Oni get out,  held up broom and duster, as if to take oath. She declared:    \"It was a monkey, or baboon; but he seemed to talk--Russian, I think.\"    \"No,\" said the butler. \"I heard the creature--a black ram, running on  its hind legs; but its language was German, I'm sure.\"    The cook, a fat Dutch woman, told a long story. She declared, on honor,  that it was a black dog like a Chinese pug, that has no hair. However,  she had only seen its back, but she was positive the creature talked  English, for she heard it say \"soy.\"    The valet honestly avowed that he was too scared to be certain of  anything, but was ready to swear that to his ears the words uttered  seemed to be Swedish. He had once heard sailors from Sweden talking, and  the chatter sounded like their lingo.    Then there was Boots, the errand boy, who believed that it was the  Devil; but, whatever or whoever it was, he was ready to bet a week's  wages that its lingo was all in French.    Now when the Princess found that not one of her servants could speak or  understand any language but their own, she scolded them roundly in  Dutch, and wound up by saying, \"You're a lot of cheese-heads, all of  you.\"    Then she arranged the wonderful things from the Far East, with her own  dainty hands, until the House in the Wood was fragrant with Oriental  odors, and soon it became famous throughout all Europe. Even when her  grandchildren played with the pretty toys from the land of Fuji and  flowers, of silk and tea, cherry blossoms and camphor trees, it was not  only the first but the finest Japanese collection in all Europe.    Meanwhile, the Oni, in a strange land, got into one trouble after  another. In rushed men with clubs, but as an Oni was well used to seeing  these at home, he was not afraid. He could outrun, outjump, or outclimb  any man, easily. The farmer's vrouw (wife) nearly fainted when the Oni  leaped first into her room and then into her bureau drawer. As he did  so, the bottle of soy, held in his three-fingered paw, hit the wood and  the dark liquid, as black as tar, ran all over the nicely starched  laces, collars and nightcaps. Every bit of her quilled and crimped  hear-gear and neckwear, once as white as snow, was ruined.    \"Donder en Bliksem\" (thunder and lightning), cried the vrouw. \"There's  my best cap, that cost twenty guilders, utterly ruined.\" Then she  bravely ran for the broomstick.    The Oni caught sight of what he thought was a big hole in the wall and  ran into it. Seeing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#14)"],[1,"for Carson to  make sure that none of the vigorous appetites at the post suffered. No  one could have done better and very few as well as he. When spring came,  and he gave up his position, he was complimented by those whom he left  behind on the admirable manner in which he had met all requirements.    During those years there was much similarity in the life and experience  of Kit Carson. He had become known all through the west and southwest  as the most daring, sagacious and brilliant leader in that country. His  services were in demand wherever he went, and as he was in the enjoyment  of perfect health, overrunning with life and activity, he made money  rapidly and showed his wisdom by laying aside a respectable sum for a  rainy day.    In the spring following his engagement at Brown's Hole, he went with  a small party to the Black Hills, where they were quite successful in  hunting. Later in the summer they joined the main body of trappers on  Green River. All meeting at the general rendezvous on a branch of the  Wind River. Still later, the majority of the trappers went into winter  quarters on the Yellowstone. They were again in the country of their  bitter enemies, the Blackfeet, and were certain of a fight with them;  but several months passed without molestation.    One day, however, several of the trappers who were making the rounds  of the traps, came upon signs which showed they were close to a strong  force of the Blackfeet. The men lost no time in hurrying back to camp  with the news, where it was agreed that trouble was at hand.    Forty men were selected at once to hunt out the Indians and engage them  in battle. It goes without saying, that Kit Carson was made the leader  and there was not a moment's unnecessary delay in starting out to find  the enemy.    They were successful in their search. They suddenly found themselves in  the presence of a scouting party, who were undoubtedly looking for them;  but perceiving the strength of the whites, they began retreating. Carson  and his men pressed them hotly, when, as anticipated, they fell back on  the main body and one of the old fashioned battles between trappers and  Indians began.    The Blackfeet always fight bravely, and, for a time, they held their  ground well, but they were forced to give way and retired to a small  island in the Yellowstone, where they had thrown up rude fortifications  and felt able to hold their own against a much superior force.    Darkness closed in upon the contending forces, and the assailants ceased  firing and encamped for the night on the bank of the river. They were on  the qui vive through the still hours, and so eager for the attack that  with the earliest streakings of light in the east, they plunged into the  stream and made for the barricades. It was not to be supposed that the  Blackfeet would be taken off their guard, and the trappers expected to  reach the defences through a hot fusillade from the dusky defenders.    To their surprise, however, not a single gun was discharged and they  rushed pell mell over the rugged fortifications to engage the enemy  in hand to hand conflict. To their chagrin, however, not a solitary  Blackfoot was visible. Despite the watchfulness of the white men, the  entire Indian force had withdrawn during the night without arousing the  least suspicion on the part of the watchers.    But the trappers were too wise to misconstrue the action of the  Blackfeet. Their withdrawal was a strategic movement, and did not by  any means signify they were afraid of the large force or that they would  prefer not to molest them. The signs around the fortifications showed  that the Indians had suffered severely and they would never content  themselves until full retaliation had been made.    The trappers returned to camp, where a long council was held. The  conclusion was that the Blackfoot village was near by, and when they  learned of the severe punishment received by the scouting party, they  would lose no time in entering upon a campaign of revenge. As the  Blackfeet nation included several thousand warriors, there was reason to  fear they would overwhelm the trappers, despite their bravery and skill.  Barricades were thrown up and the best men stationed as sentinels. One  of them hastened to the top of an adjoining hill, which commanded an  extensive view of the surrounding country.    The sentinel had been in position but a short time when he signalled  to his friends the approach of a large body of Indians. The hunters  immediately began strengthening their defences, and before the redskin  arrived, they had rendered their position almost impregnable against any  force that could be gathered in the country.    As the Blackfeet approached, the sentinel hurried down from the hill and  joined the main body. Shortly after, the advance party of Blackfeet came  in sight and made a reconnaissance which apprised them of the nature of  the defences. They did not fire a shot but waited until the arrival of  the main band.    When that came in sight, it was enough to strike dismay into every  heart. There were few if any less than a thousand warriors. Dr. Peters,  the biographer of Carson, says:    \"It was a sight which few white men of the American nation have looked  upon. Arrayed in their fantastic war costume and bedaubed with paint,  armed with lances, bows and arrows, rifles, tomahawks, knives, etc.,  some mounted and some on foot, they presented a wild and fearful scene  of barbaric fancy.    \"Soon after their last company had reported, the frightful war dance,  peculiar to the American savages, was enacted in sight of the trappers'  position. The battle songs and shouts which accompanied the dance  reached the ears of the whites with fearful distinctness. Any other  than hearts of oak with courage of steel would have quailed before this  terrible display of savage enmity and ferocity. This dance, to men well  skilled in the ways of the Indian warrior, was a sure signal that the  next day would be certain to have a fearful history for one party or the  other and doubtless for both. The odds, most assuredly, were apparently  greatly in favor of the savage host and against the little band of hardy  mountaineers.\"        CHAPTER XVII.       The Morrow--Withdrawal of the Indian Army--At Fort Hall--In the   Blackfoot Country--The Ambush--The Trappers Decide to Withdraw--Trapping   in Other Localities--Carson Decides to Abandon the Business--Visits   Bent's Fort Where He Serves as Hunter for Eight Years.    Having gone through what the red men consider the necessary  preliminaries of such a grand campaign, the vast number of warriors  awaited the dawn that was to witness the annihilation of the entire  force that had dared to venture upon their hunting grounds without so  much as asking permission.    It was scarcely light when the imposing array advanced upon the  mountaineers, who coolly awaited their approach. When the Blackfeet came  close enough to see the fortifications thrown up by the whites, they  were astonished. They knew from previous experience the strength of such  means of defence and suddenly lost their eagerness to make the attack.    After a full survey of the work before them, they concluded the task  was beyond accomplishment. The magnificent force, therefore, began  withdrawing. It was the turn of the trappers to feel disappointed. They  had not thought of any such issue and were enraged. They shouted and  made tantalizing gestures to the Blackfeet, in the hope of goading them  to stand their ground, but they were too wise to do so. They retreated  to a safe point where a council of war was held. It was not to be  expected that after such an abrupt withdrawal, they could summon enough  courage to make the assault.    When the conference was over, the Indian army, as it may be called,  broke into two divisions, one of which went back toward their own  village while the other set their faces toward the Crow country.  Uncertain whether they would not reappear when they believed there  was hope of surprising the mountaineers, the latter maintained their  vigilance day and night.    It may have been that the red men made several reconnaissances, but, if  so, they concluded it would be imprudent to attack the mountaineers  who held their position and continued trapping as opportunity presented  through the winter.    After trapping in various localities, Kit Carson and several friends  visited Fort Hall, where they joined a party in the employ of the  Northwest Fur Company. They trapped around the head of Salmon River and  other streams, and finally returned to Fort Hall, where the peltries  were sold for a fair valuation. Then Carson and a few others set out to  join a party which he knew was trapping in the Blackfoot country.  Upon coming up with them, he was told that they had had several sharp  skirmishes with the Indians, in one of which a trapper was severely  wounded. The following morning, Carson and his comrades parted from the  rest and were trapping slowly up stream, when they were fired upon by  Blackfeet and compelled to retreat. They hurried back and succeeded  in escaping a serious danger; but the pursuit was so close that Carson  hastily stationed his men in ambush. A hot fire dropped several of the  warriors and caused the others to hesitate.    The halt was just long enough to allow the trappers to reload their  pieces, when the Blackfeet made a fiercer rush than before; but with  that pertinacious courage for which the tribe is noted, they kept up the  fight through the rest of the day, determined to throw away no advantage  they might gain. Had Carson chosen his position with less judgment,  he and his command must have been overwhelmed, for nothing could have  exceeded the daring of their assailants, who in their desperation set  fire to the thicket in which the mountaineers had ensconced themselves;  but the shrubbery was too green to burn well, and, "]]]
