They were at the time trying to make a roadway to the nitrate bed through  a trackless wilderness, and had thus far progressed with greater ease than  the young speculator had calculated.    But upon reaching the spot where the teamsters and workmen were holding an  excited controversy, Jack found that the cause of the excitement was the  fact that the way had been stopped by a sharp, rocky ridge, which extended  for miles in both directions.    \"We can't go any further, senor,\" declared the head driver. \"No team can  find its way through these rocks and up and down the hill.\"    Jack had seen this place when making his survey and had calculated upon  the difficulty in passing it, having the route most feasible at this  point.    \"Let two men come forward with axes to clear away the stunted growth, and  the rest get their levers. I will show you by to-morrow it can be passed.\"    Lively work followed, the men taking hold with a vim, so that by noon the  next day a path had been cleared, so the teams could cross the rocky  ridge.    The balance of the distance to the mine was very favorable and at last  Jack had the satisfaction of finding himself at his destination, when the  men were set to work loading the carts, the oxen getting a chance to rest  while it was being done.    While superintending the work Jack had time to realize more fully than  before the gigantic undertaking he had upon hand. It is true the worst  seemed over, now that the path was cleared, but he knew with the rude  implements he had to work with that this had been poorly done, and that  the loaded teams would have difficult work to reach the open country. Even  then he would be many miles from the nearest seaport, where he was likely  to meet with another obstacle in finding a ship to transport his cargo to  the United States. Then, after he had reached home, how would he be  treated? A failure to sell his nitrate meant the loss of every penny of  money he had worked so hard to earn. But these anxious thoughts did not  rob him of his confidence in his ultimate success. Now he had put his  shoulder to the wheel, he was not one to look back.    When the hour came for him to give the order to hitch up the cattle and  prepare for the return journey, he gave his orders in a cheery tone.    \"I tell you, Jack,\" said Plum, speaking with less drawl than common, \"I'm  mighty glad to do this. I don't see how you can be so chipper, for I'm  dead sure we're going to have loads of trouble before we get out of this.\"    \"No great thing was ever done without having more or less trouble at the  outset,\" replied Jack. \"As soon as we get started we shall find it easier.  Hi, there, Pedro!\" addressing one of the Peruvian drivers, \"you have those  oxen yoked wrong. You ought to know better by this time.\"    \"Who knows best, senor, you or I?\" demanded the Peruvian, showing anger at  what he deemed an unwarranted interference.    Jack said nothing further, feeling that he had spoken too sharply perhaps,  though he knew he was in the right. He had found the natives anything but  pleasant men to deal with, and the quarrel of one was sure to be taken up  by his companions.    Five minutes later the foremost team was leaving the nitrate bed, starting  on its long journey at the slow pace of oxen, while the other soon  followed.    Vague reports had reached Jack before he had left on his trip, of the  uprising of the people, and of the guerrilla warfare being carried on by  the straggling armies of the North and South. Still he did not think he  would be molested, and he felt in good spirits, as they followed the rough  pathway.    To be on his guard as much as possible, however, he had thought best to  keep a short distance ahead of the teams, while Plum Plucky followed about  the same distance behind, the two thus maintaining a continual watch over  the train.    Nothing occurred to delay their progress, until Jack found himself  climbing the steep upgrade, which the Peruvians had declared impassable  before they had done so much work in clearing it. The course was uneven  now, and considerable of the way it was little more than a scratch on the  mountain side, with a sheer descent on one side of hundreds of feet.    He had got about half way toward the top when the loud cries of the  teamsters caused him to look back.    A glance showed him that the foremost team was \"hung up\" at a particularly  bad place.    The drivers were belaboring the patient oxen unmercifully, but not another  inch could they make the animals pull the load.    Shouting to the men to stop their useless goading of the oxen, our hero  ran back to the spot, finding that the second team had stopped a short  distance below, where it was comfortably waiting for the other to move  ahead so it could resume its tedious journey.    As there was no chance to get the oxen on the lower team past the upper  one, so as to be hitched on to help, on account of the narrowness of the  road, Jack quickly dismissed such an idea from his thoughts.    Not wishing to throw off a part of the load, which must be lost by so  doing, he stepped alongside the cattle and began to stroke them and to  speak gently to them.    \"Both teams couldn't pull the load up this path, senor,\" said one of the  drivers.    \"I am sorry I did not think to double up at the foot of the ascent, but it  is too late to complain now. Come, boys! all together.\"    Jack had taken the long, slender pole, with its ten feet of lash, with  which the drivers urged on their patient teams, and swinging the unwieldly  instrument over their heads as he uttered the words, he hoped to make them  start.    The result was most unexpected.    Putting their shoulders to the work with renewed life, the obedient oxen  fairly touched the ground with their bodies as they tugged ahead with  their burden.    The cart creaked and the axles groaned, while the heavy wheels began to  revolve.    \"Hooray! it is mov--\"    Plum Plucky gave expression to the exultant cry, but he did not have time  to finish before a loud snap was heard, and the oxen were seen to suddenly  plunge up the grade, leaving the cart!    \"The pull pin has broken!\" cried one of the Peruvians, terrified.    \"The clevis has broke--look out!\" yelled Plum, turning pale. \"The other  team will be smashed!\"    The heavily loaded wagon, freed suddenly from the power which had pulled  it to this precarious position, stood for a moment as if balanced on the  pinacle.    Of course Jack had seen what was taking place with a quicker eye than any  of his companions, and as he saw the wagon trembling in the balance for a  moment before it started on its downward course to destruction, and  realizing that a timely action could yet save it, he rushed forward to  seize hold of one of the wheels, shouting to his assistants:    \"Quick--put your shoulder to the wheel and we may save it!\"    Plum did spring forward to help his friend, but even he was too late to be  of any avail, while the Peruvians stood idle, without offering to move.    While the united strength of all might have stopped the wagon, Jack's  resistance was futile, and in a moment the loaded vehicle started on its  downward course, soon gaining a momentum that nothing could stop.    Faster and faster it moved, the wheels creaking and groaning unanimously,  as it gained in speed.    The drivers of the other team in the pathway below uttered wild cries of  terror, as they saw their danger, and began to scramble helter-skelter up  the mountain side.    The runaway was going directly upon them, but they were likely to escape.    Not so with the oxen and wagon, which seemed surely doomed.    Jack saw at a glance his whole work going to naught in a moment's time.    Then his presence of mind returned to him and he thought he saw a way to  avert a part of the loss.    Bounding down the pathway after the runaway, he soon managed to catch hold  of the tongue, which was dodging swiftly from one side to the other of the  path, according as it was swung to and fro by the motion of the forward  wheels.    Grasping this forearm with all the strength he possessed, Jack swung it  toward the near side, until locking the forward wheel on that side against  the sill of the cart.    He had seen that the only chance to save the rear wagon was at the  sacrifice of the other, and no sooner had he begun to hold the pole in  that position that the wagon began to turn toward the gulf yawning on that  side of the track.    It was a fearful alternative, but the best he could do, and Jack breathed  a sigh of relief as he found the hind wheels going over the brink of the  chasm.    For a moment the big load stood quivering on the edge of the precipice,  and then, with a crash which sounded far up and down the rugged valley,  the wagon went headlong to its doom.          Chapter XVIII    An Alarm of Fire        Breathless and exhausted by his almost superhuman effort, Jack sank down  upon the hard rocks, where he had stood at the fateful moment.    Plum Plucky, further up the broken pathway, stood in silent awe, while the  Peruvians looked on from their perches on the mountain side with bulging  eyes and chattering teeth.    The only creatures which seemed unconcerned were the oxen which had been  so narrowly threatened, as they quietly chewed their cuds, while they  blinked their big, soft-lighted eyes.  Plum was the first to speak.    \"Jiminey whack, Jack! but you've done it.\"    \"It was my only chance to save the oxen and the other load,\" said Jack,  rising to feet. \"Better save half a loaf than to lose it all, you know.  Simply couldn't turn it into the rocks.\"    \"But I don't see how you could think of it. I was scart, I ain't ashamed  to own. I'll bet that other is smashed into kindling wood.\"    Jack was already looking over the precipice after the lost wagon, saying  in a minute or so:    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#14)"],[1,"man's humble demeanour, and as if  he wanted to force him to believe him.  But he did not want to hurt the  man and had only taken hold of him very lightly.  Nonetheless, the man  cried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot  tongs.  Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, if  he didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even  thought K. was a judge.  And before leaving, he held him a lot harder,  shoved him back onto the bench and walked on.  \"These defendants are so  sensitive, most of them,\" said the usher of the court.  Almost all of  those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now,  had stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise  questions about the incident.  K. was approached by a security guard,  identifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to be  made of aluminium.  This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it  with his hand.  The guard had come because of the shouting and asked  what had been happening.  The usher of the court said a few words to try  and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it  himself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps,  probably because of gout.            K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,  especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it  on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that  way.  He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher  nodded, and that is the way that K. went.  The usher remained always one  or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this  it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone  who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up,  but the usher always remained behind him.  In order to put an end to his  discomfort, K. finally said, \"Now that I've seen what it looks like  here, I'd like to go.\"  \"You haven't seen everything yet,\" said the  usher ingenuously.  \"I don't want to see everything,\" said K., who was also feeling very  tired, \"I want to go, what is the way to the exit?\"  \"You haven't got  lost, have you?\" asked the usher in amazement, \"you go down this way to  the corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the  door.\"  \"Come with me,\" said K., \"show me the way, I'll miss it, there  are so many different ways here.\"  \"It's the only way there is,\" said  the usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, \"I can't go  back with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already  lost a lot of time because of you as it is.\"  \"Come with me!\" K.  repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out  in a lie.  \"Don't shout like that,\" whispered the usher, \"there's  offices all round us here.  If you don't want to go back by yourself  come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out my  report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again.\"  \"No, no,\" said  K., \"I will not wait and you must come with me now.\"  K. had still not  looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and  it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that  he noticed it.  A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s  voice, entered and asked, \"What is it the gentleman wants?\"  In the  darkness behind her there was also a man approaching.  K. looked at the  usher.  He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K.,  and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone  in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as  to why he was there.  The only understandable and acceptable thing to  say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of  his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give,  especially as it was not true - he had only come out of curiosity.  Or  else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted to  ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the  outside.  And it did seem that he had been quite right in this  supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed  enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of  mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind  any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if  needs be, alone.            But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and  the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they  thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which  they didn't want to miss seeing.  And in the doorway stood the man whom  K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam  above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if  becoming impatient as he watched.  But the young woman was the first to  recognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell,  she brought a chair and asked,  \"Would you not like to sit down?\"  K. sat down immediately and, in order  to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests.  \"You're a  little bit dizzy, aren't you?\" she asked him.  Her face was now close in  front of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women have  just when they're in the bloom of their youth.  \"It's nothing for you to  worry about,\" she said, \"that's nothing unusual here, almost everyone  gets an attack like that the first time they come here.  This is your  first time is it?  Yes, it's nothing unusual then.  The sun burns down  on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy.  It makes  this place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages it  might offer.  But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when  there's a lot of business, and that's almost every day.  And when you  think that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well - and we  can't stop the tenants doing that - it's not surprising you started to  feel unwell.  But you get used to the air alright in the end.  When  you're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how  oppressive the air is.  Are you feeling any better now?\"  K. made no  answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these  people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill  made him feel not better but a little worse.  The girl noticed it  straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window  pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch  directly above K.'s head that led to the outside.  But so much soot fell  in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the  soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do  that for himself.  He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was  until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made  about him the sooner that would be.  But then the girl said, \"You can't  stay here, we're in people's way here ...\"  K. looked at her as if to  ask whose way they were impeding.  \"If you like, I can take you to the  sick room,\" and turning to the man in the doorway said, \"please help  me\".  The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go  to the sick room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led  further from place to place, the further he went the more difficult it  must become.  So he said, \"I am able to walk now,\" and stood up, shaking  after becoming used to sitting so comfortably.  But then he was unable  to stay upright. \"I can't manage it,\" he said shaking his head, and sat  down again with a sigh.  He remembered the usher who, despite  everything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed  to have gone long before.  K. looked out between the man and the young  woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the  usher.  \"I think,\" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose  appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had  two long, sharply tailored points, \"the gentleman is feeling unwell  because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would  most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out  of the offices altogether.\"  \"That's right,\" exclaimed K., with such joy  that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, \"I'm sure that'll  make me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need  is a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's  not such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the  stairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like  this at all, I'm surprised at it myself.  I also work in an office and  I'm quite used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've  said so yourselves.  So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a  little, I'm feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up  by myself.\"  And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for  the two of them to take him by the arms.            The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood  there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud.  \"There, you see,\" he said to the girl, \"I was quite right.  The  gentleman is only unwell here, and not in general.\"  The young woman  smiled too, but lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her  fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K.  \"So what do  you think, then?\" said the man, still laughing, \"I really do want to  lead the gentleman out of here.\"  \"That's alright, then,\" said the girl,  briefly inclining her charming head.  \"Don't worry too much about him  laughing,\" said the girl to K., who had become unhappy once more and  stared quietly"]]]
