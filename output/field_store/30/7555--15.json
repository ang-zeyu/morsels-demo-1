The wind was whirling past  him and seemed to say, \"Hurry on, hurry on, we have no time to stop.  'Tis Christmas Eve and everybody is in a hurry to-night.\"    Again and again the little child rapped softly at door or window-pane.  At each place he was refused admission. One mother feared he might have  some ugly disease which her darlings would catch; another father said  he had only enough for his own children and none to spare for beggars.  Still another told him to go home where he belonged, and not to trouble  other folks.    The hours passed; later grew the night, and colder grew the wind, and  darker seemed the street. Farther and farther the little one wandered.  There was scarcely any one left upon the street by this time, and the  few who remained did not seem to see the child, when suddenly ahead of  him there appeared a bright, single ray of light. It shone through the  darkness into the child's eyes. He looked up smilingly and said, \"I  will go where the small light beckons, perhaps they will share their  Christmas with me.\"    Hurrying past all the other houses, he soon reached the end of the  street and went straight up to the window from which the light was  streaming. It was a poor, little, low house, but the child cared not for  that. The light seemed still to call him in. From what do you suppose  the light came? Nothing but a tallow candle which had been placed in  an old cup with a broken handle, in the window, as a glad token of  Christmas Eve. There was neither curtain nor shade to the small, square  window and as the little child looked in he saw standing upon a  neat wooden table a branch of a Christmas tree. The room was plainly  furnished but it was very clean. Near the fireplace sat a lovely faced  mother with a little two-year-old on her knee and an older child  beside her. The two children were looking into their mother's face and  listening to a story. She must have been telling them a Christmas story,  I think. A few bright coals were burning in the fireplace, and all  seemed light and warm within.    The little wanderer crept closer and closer to the window-pane. So sweet  was the mother's face, so loving seemed the little children, that at  last he took courage and tapped gently, very gently on the door. The  mother stopped talking, the little children looked up. \"What was that,  mother?\" asked the little girl at her side. \"I think it was some one  tapping on the door,\" replied the mother. \"Run as quickly as you can and  open it, dear, for it is a bitter cold night to keep any one waiting in  this storm.\" \"Oh, mother, I think it was the bough of the tree tapping  against the window-pane,\" said the little girl. \"Do please go on with  our story.\" Again the little wanderer tapped upon the door. \"My child,  my child,\" exclaimed the mother, rising, \"that certainly was a rap on  the door. Run quickly and open it. No one must be left out in the cold  on our beautiful Christmas Eve.\"    The child ran to the door and threw it wide open. The mother saw the  ragged stranger standing without, cold and shivering, with bare head and  almost bare feet. She held out both hands and drew him into the warm,  bright room. \"You poor, dear child,\" was all she said, and putting her  arms around him, she drew him close to her breast. \"He is very cold, my  children,\" she exclaimed. \"We must warm him.\" \"And,\" added the little  girl, \"we must love him and give him some of our Christmas, too.\" \"Yes,\"  said the mother, \"but first let us warm him--\"    The mother sat down by the fire with the little child on her lap, and  her own little ones warmed his half-frozen hands in theirs. The mother  smoothed his tangled curls, and, bending low over his head, kissed the  child's face. She gathered the three little ones in her arms and the  candle and the fire light shone over them. For a moment the room was  very still. By and by the little girl said softly, to her mother,  \"May we not light the Christmas tree, and let him see how beautiful it  looks?\" \"Yes,\" said the mother. With that she seated the child on a  low stool beside the fire, and went herself to fetch the few simple  ornaments which from year to year she had saved for her children's  Christmas tree. They were soon so busy that they did not notice the room  had filled with a strange and brilliant light. They turned and looked at  the spot where the little wanderer sat. His ragged clothes had changed  to garments white and beautiful; his tangled curls seemed like a halo  of golden light about his head; but most glorious of all was his face,  which shone with a light so dazzling that they could scarcely look upon  it.    In silent wonder they gazed at the child. Their little room seemed to  grow larger and larger, until it was as wide as the whole world, the  roof of their low house seemed to expand and rise, until it reached to  the sky.    With a sweet and gentle smile the wonderful child looked upon them for  a moment, and then slowly rose and floated through the air, above  the treetops, beyond the church spire, higher even than the clouds  themselves, until he appeared to them to be a shining star in the sky  above. At last he disappeared from sight. The astonished children turned  in hushed awe to their mother, and said in a whisper, \"Oh, mother, it  was the Christ-Child, was it not?\" And the mother answered in a low  tone, \"Yes.\"    And it is said, dear children, that each Christmas Eve the little  Christ-Child wanders through some town or village, and those who receive  him and take him into their homes and hearts have given to them this  marvellous vision which is denied to others.          XI. JIMMY SCARECROW'S CHRISTMAS    MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN    Jimmy Scarecrow led a sad life in the winter. Jimmy's greatest grief  was his lack of occupation. He liked to be useful, and in winter he was  absolutely of no use at all.    He wondered how many such miserable winters he would have to endure. He  was a young Scarecrow, and this was his first one. He was strongly made,  and although his wooden joints creaked a little when the wind blew he  did not grow in the least rickety. Every morning, when the wintry sun  peered like a hard yellow eye across the dry corn-stubble, Jimmy felt  sad, but at Christmas time his heart nearly broke.    On Christmas Eve Santa Claus came in his sledge heaped high with  presents, urging his team of reindeer across the field. He was on his  way to the farmhouse where Betsey lived with her Aunt Hannah.    Betsey was a very good little girl with very smooth yellow curls, and  she had a great many presents. Santa Claus had a large wax doll-baby  for her on his arm, tucked up against the fur collar of his coat. He was  afraid to trust it in the pack, lest it get broken.    When poor Jimmy Scarecrow saw Santa Claus his heart gave a great leap.  \"Santa Claus! Here I am!\" he cried out, but Santa Claus did not hear  him.    \"Santa Claus, please give me a little present. I was good all summer  and kept the crows out of the corn,\" pleaded the poor Scarecrow in his  choking voice, but Santa Claus passed by with a merry halloo and a great  clamour of bells.    Then Jimmy Scarecrow stood in the corn-stubble and shook with sobs until  his joints creaked. \"I am of no use in the world, and everybody has  forgotten me,\" he moaned. But he was mistaken.    The next morning Betsey sat at the window holding her Christmas  doll-baby, and she looked out at Jimmy Scarecrow standing alone in the  field amidst the corn-stubble.    \"Aunt Hannah?\" said she. Aunt Hannah was making a crazy patchwork quilt,  and she frowned hard at a triangular piece of red silk and circular  piece of pink, wondering how to fit them together. \"Well?\" said she.    \"Did Santa Claus bring the Scarecrow any Christmas present?\"    \"No, of course he didn't.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because he's a Scarecrow. Don't ask silly questions.\"    \"I wouldn't like to be treated so, if I was a Scarecrow,\" said Betsey,  but her Aunt Hannah did not hear her. She was busy cutting a triangular  snip out of the round piece of pink silk so the piece of red silk could  be feather-stitched into it.    It was snowing hard out of doors, and the north wind blew. The  Scarecrow's poor old coat got whiter and whiter with snow. Sometimes he  almost vanished in the thick white storm. Aunt Hannah worked until the  middle of the afternoon on her crazy quilt. Then she got up and spread  it out over the sofa with an air of pride.    \"There,\" said she, \"that's done, and that makes the eighth. I've got one  for every bed in the house, and I've given four away. I'd give this away  if I knew of anybody that wanted it.\"    Aunt Hannah put on her hood and shawl, and drew some blue yarn stockings  on over her shoes, and set out through the snow to carry a slice of  plum-pudding to her sister Susan, who lived down the road. Half an hour  after Aunt Hannah had gone Betsey put her little red plaid shawl over  her head, and ran across the field to Jimmy Scarecrow. She carried her  new doll-baby smuggled up under her shawl.    \"Wish you Merry Christmas!\" she said to Jimmy Scarecrow.    \"Wish you the same,\" said Jimmy, but his voice was choked with sobs, and  was also muffled, for his old hat had slipped down to his chin. Betsey  looked pitifully at the old hat fringed with icicles, like frozen tears,  and the old snow-laden coat. \"I've brought you a Christmas present,\"  said she, and with that she tucked her doll-baby inside Jimmy  Scarecrow's coat, sticking its tiny feet into a pocket.    \"Thank you,\" said Jimmy Scarecrow faintly.    \"You're welcome,\" said she. \"Keep her under your overcoat, so the snow  won't wet her, and she won't catch cold, she's delicate.\"    \"Yes, I will,\" said Jimmy Scarecrow, and he tried hard to bring one of  his stiff, outstretched arms around to clasp the doll-baby.    \"Don't you feel cold in that old summer coat?\" asked Betsey.    \"If I bad a little exercise, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#14)"],[1,"paper thin soled shoes, and so did Freddy  Farmer's. It was as though the gods had kidded them along this far just  for the added pleasure of slapping them down just a hair's breadth  short of the mark. If Serrangi tossed them out, there would be nothing  to do but go back to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth and report complete  failure. And the suspected deadly menace that was creeping slowly but  surely around the British in the Far East would remain as much of a  mystery as ever.    \"Well, that is the way with war!\" Dave said in a bitter voice that was  far from all sham.    \"True words you speak,\" Serrangi said almost kindly. \"Who are we to  pick and choose, and say when and how we will accomplish a task? But  there is no room for you here in Singapore. If only you were Luftwaffe  pilots, then that would be a different matter.\"    Both Dave and Freddy came close to falling off their chairs in stunned  amazement at the man's words. They stared wide eyed at him as though  they could not, or did not dare, trust their ears. It was Dave who  found his tongue first.    \"If _we_ were Luftwaffe pilots?\" he cried. \"Why do you say that?\"    \"There is a task,\" Serrangi said with a shrug. \"But the men must be  able to fly airplanes. True there is one here in Singapore who could do  the task. But he cannot leave his post. Rather he would undo much that  has been prepared, if he were to do so.\"    \"It is the will of _Der Fuehrer_ again!\" Freddy Farmer cried wildly and  sprang to his feet. \"_Heil Hitler!_ His thoughts are always with one  and all. You are always in the Leader's heart. Serrangi! Look at us.  Your wish has been granted. Your desire has been fulfilled!\"    The Sumatran looked, but the expression on his face was like that of a  man waiting for the rabbits to come popping out of the high silk hat.    \"More words!\" he finally snapped. \"What do you mean, my loud mouthed  friend?\"    \"_Der Fuehrer's_ solution of your problem!\" Freddy cried and pointed  to Dave and then at himself. \"My friend and I are seasoned veterans  of the great and glorious Luftwaffe. Not until after Crete were we  assigned full time duty under _Herr_ Himmler. _Gott!_ Fly airplanes? My  new found friend, we can do that in our sleep. So you see? It is the  Leader's will that we be given work to do for him, though we cannot  continue our journey to Australia!\"    \"But absolutely!\" Dave shouted, taking the cue from Freddy Farmer. \"Fly  airplanes? The joy of my life. And after all, it is not an impossible  flight from here to Australia, given the correct plane.\"    A happy look that had gradually spread over Serrangi's face as the two  boys \"raved\" was suddenly banished by a look of sharp annoyance.    \"Impossible!\" he grated. \"The flight that must be made is in the  opposite direction. To the north. Besides, there is more than _Herr_  Hitler's desires connected with the matter. But this is true? You two  are airplane pilots?\"    \"But of course!\" Dave shouted right back at him. \"And my comrade here  is one of Germany's greatest. He has been decorated by _Der Fuehrer's_  own hand. It was for unbelievable gallantry in the Norway campaign.  But, a flight to the north, you say? Why to the north? And what is the  task that is to be undertaken?\"    \"You suggested I communicate with Berlin!\" Serrangi snarled with heavy  sarcasm. \"Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to communicate with  Tokio!\"    Dave felt as though he had suddenly been slapped across the face with a  bolt of lightning. In spite of his efforts his eyes flew open wide with  amazement. In a flash, though, he realized his mistake and hastened to  cover it up.    \"Tokio?\" he breathed eagerly. \"So it is to come _soon_, eh? So perhaps  it will not be a complete loss if my friend and I do not reach  Australia. After all, it seems that the tasks are connected.\"    A bright light shot through Serrangi's eyes, and he gave Dave a  searching look that seemed to probe right into his brain.    \"So that was the kind of work you would do in Australia, eh?\" he  murmured. \"But, of course. Berlin and Tokio are working together.  And the fat fool in Rome thumps his chest, and shouts stupid things  to his stupid soldiers. Well, this is all very different. Much, much  different.\"    Serrangi paused and nodded his head, and came as close to beaming with  pleasure as it was possible for a man with his face to do so. Dave and  Freddy practically hung on the edges of their chairs waiting for the  Sumatran to say more. But when the words finally did come they dashed  high hopes back down again on the cold, cold ground.    \"I do not know the details of the task,\" the Devil's Den owner said.  \"I only know that there is a task to be accomplished. That there is a  flight to be made to the north. And I also know this!\"    The man stopped abruptly and fastened the two youths with a steady  stare.    \"I know that it may mean death even before the flight is begun!\" he  snapped.    \"We are not dead, yet,\" Dave said with true Nazi bravado, and airily  waved a hand. \"And for that matter, neither of us expects to be  dead for a long, long time to come. But if you know nothing of the  details...?\"    Dawson let the rest trail off significantly, and waited.    \"No, I know nothing of the details,\" Serrangi said. \"But I do know  where the details are to be obtained. Two streets north of where we  are, now, there is a small rug merchant's shop on the corner. The name  on the hanging sign is Agiz Ammarir. I will give you a coin presently.  You will go to the rug merchant's shop, ask for Agiz Ammarir. There  will be a native girl who greets you at the door. Tell her that you  have a bill to settle. She will summon Agiz Ammarir. When he appears  give him the coin. The coin will tell him all he wants to know. From  him you will learn more of what is to be done. What _must_ be done ...  and soon!\"    The man almost shouted the last. His face clouded with fury and he  smashed both clenched fists down on the arms of the chair. The cold  anger in his eyes caused a tiny shiver to ripple up and down Dave's  spine. Here indeed was the real Serrangi coming to the surface.  The savage beast within him breaking through the thin veneer of  civilization in which he cloaked his true self. Dave thought of being  a helpless prisoner in the hands of a man like Serrangi, and the very  thought made his blood run cold.    \"Have no doubts about us, Serrangi,\" Dave heard Freddy Farmer speak up.  \"If it can be done, we will do it.\"    The Devil's Den owner snorted through his thin hawk-beak nose and flung  the English youth a withering glance.    \"I know all about your Nazi boasts!\" he snapped. \"But the Far East is  not Germany. And Singapore is not your Berlin where you can demand the  help of any man on the street, whether it costs his life or not. But it  is I who talks too much, now. Enough! Here is the coin you will give to  Agiz Ammarir. Leave here within the next fifteen minutes and go to his  rug shop. Perhaps we shall meet again. But, whether we do or not ...  _Heil Hitler!_\"    Both youths sprang to their feet and returned the Nazi Party cry and  salute. Serrangi shrugged and then waved them away as though they  were two pieces of merchandise in which he was no longer interested.  As they stepped outside the door into the hall of pitch darkness,  two shapes materialized at their side, took them each by the arm and  silently led them to the door of the coffee shop. When they passed  through into the dim, smoke filled room their two escorts melted back  into the darkness. Ignoring a few questioning glances that were cast  their way, Dave led the way to their vacated table, started to slump  down in his chair, but checked himself and gave Freddy a meaning look.    \"Why drink more of this poison?\" he growled in thick French. \"Let us go  somewhere else, eh?\"    The English youth nodded glumly, and the pair slouched nonchalantly  toward the front door.          CHAPTER TEN    _The Touch Of Death_      In the matter of a few seconds Dave and Freddy were once more out in  Bukum Street. The street of a million different smells and all bad.  Nevertheless, after the inside of the Devil's Den both boys stopped and  dragged night air deep into their lungs.    \"Sweet tripe, I know my nose will never be the same again!\" Dave  muttered. \"Imagine spending a whole evening in that place. I wouldn't  be surprised but what that's the answer to the mysterious disappearance  of Bostworth's agent.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" Freddy asked as the pair started moving  slowly up the street.    \"The poor devil probably had to spend four or five hours in that stink  hole, and just naturally passed out cold,\" Dave said. \"They got scared  and threw his body in the harbor, and he drowned. No fooling! I feel  like I'd been drugged for a year.\"    \"Well, we're out of the horrible place, anyway,\" Freddy said. Then  after a short silence, he said, \"Darnedest thing ever, wasn't it, Dave?\"    The American youth grunted, and shrugged, but didn't reply directly. He  walked along in brooding silence.    \"Well, was it anything like you expected?\" Freddy demanded when no  comment by his friend seemed forthcoming. \"Was it, I ask?\"    \"Yes, and no,\" Dave said. \"I mean, I went into that place expecting  anything. Fact is, Freddy, if you must know, I'm just a wee bit worried  about these last couple of hours. They passed off smooth as silk. Too  smooth, I'm thinking.\"    \"Good Lord!\" the English youth gasped. \"Do you think Serrangi is wise  to us? But.... But that doesn't make sense, Dave!\"    \"You tell me one thing about our war experiences that _did_ make sense  _at_ the time!\" Dave said. \"Now don't get me wrong. I don't mean that  we fell flat on our faces as far as convincing Serrangi that we're Nazi  agents. If he had suspected us at all, found any flaw in our story, you  and I would have sharp steel in us right now. No, I honestly think we  put our story over okay. But I don't"]]]
