Put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan and  baste the meat with it till the gravy begins to drop. Then baste  with the gravy. When the meat is nearly done, move it close to the  fire, dredge it with a very little flour, and baste it with  butter. Skim the fat from the gravy, which should be thickened by  shaking in a very small quantify of flour. Put it into a small  sauce-pan, and set it on hot coals. Let it just come to a boil,  and then send it to table in a boat. If the gravy is not in  sufficient quantity, add to it about half a jill or a large wine-glass  of boiling water.    In carving a loin of veal help every one to a piece of the kidney  as far as it will go.      TO ROAST A BREAST OF VEAL.    A breast of veal will require about three hours and a half to  roast. In preparing it for the spit, cover it with the caul, and  skewer the sweet-bread to the back. Take off the caul when the meat  is nearly done. The breast, being comparatively tough and coarse,  is less esteemed than the loin and the fillet.      TO ROAST A FILLET OF VEAL.    Take out the bone, and secure with skewers the fat flap to the  outside of the meat. Prepare a stuffing of fresh butter or suet  minced fine, and an equal quantity of grated bread-crumbs, a large  table-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, a table-spoonful of sweet  marjoram chopped or rubbed to powder, a nutmeg grated, and a  little pepper and salt, with a sprig of chopped parsley. Mix all  these ingredients with beaten yolk of egg, and stuff the place  from whence the bone was taken. Make deep cuts or incisions all  over the top of the veal, and fill them with some of the stuffing.  You may stick into each hole an inch of fat ham or salt pork, cut  very thin.    Having papered the fat, spit the veal and put it into the roaster,  keeping it at first not too near the fire. Put a little salt and  water into the dripping-pan, and for awhile baste the meat with  it. Then baste it with its own gravy. A fillet of veal will  require four hours roasting. As it proceeds, place it nearer to  the fire. Half an hour before it is done, remove the paper, and  baste the meat with butter, having first dredged it very lightly  with flour. Having skimmed the gravy, mix some thin melted butter  with it.    If convenient, you may in making the stuffing, use a large  proportion of chopped mushrooms that have been preserved in sweet  oil, or of chopped pickled oysters. Cold ham shred fine will  improve it.    You may stuff a fillet of veal entirely with sausage meat.    To accompany a fillet of veal, the usual dish is boiled ham or  bacon.    A shoulder of veal may be stuffed and roasted in a similar manner.      TO STEW A BREAST OF VEAL.    Divide the breast into pieces according to the position of the  bones. Put them into a stew-pan with a few slices of ham, some  whole pepper, a bunch of parsley, and a large onion quartered. Add  sufficient water to keep it from burning, and let it stew slowly  till the meat is quite tender. Then put to it a quart or more of  green peas that have boiled twenty minutes in another pot, and a  piece of butter rolled in flour. Let all stew together a quarter  of an hour longer. Serve it up, with the veal in the middle, the  peas round it, and the ham laid on the peas.    You may stew a breast of veal with tomatas.      TO STEW A FILLET OF VEAL.    Take a fillet of veal, rub it with salt, and then with a sharp  knife make deep incisions all over the surface, the bottom as well  as the top and sides. Make a stuffing of grated stale bread,  butter, chopped sweet marjoram, grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper  and salt, mixed up with beaten yolk of egg to bind and give it  consistency. Fill the holes or incisions with the stuffing,  pressing it down well with your fingers. Reserve some of the  stuffing to rub all over the outside of the meat. Have ready some  very thin slices of cold boiled ham, the fatter the better. Cover  the veal with them, fastening them on with skewers. Put it into a  pot, and stew it slowly in a very little water, just enough to  cover it. It will take at least five hours to stew; or more, in  proportion to its size. When done, take off the ham, and lay it  round the veal in a dish.    You may stew with it a quart or three pints of young green peas,  put in about an hour before dinner; add to them a little butter  and pepper while they are stewing. Serve them up in the dish with  the veal, laying the slices of ham upon them.    If you omit the ham, stew the veal entirely in lard.      TO STEW A KNUCKLE OF VEAL.    Lay four wooden skewers across the bottom of your stew-pan, and  place the meat upon them; having first carefully washed it, and  rubbed it with salt. Add a table-spoonful of whole pepper, the  leaves from a bunch of sweet marjoram, a bunch of parsley leaves  chopped, two onions peeled and sliced, and a piece of butter  rolled in flour. Pour in two quarts of water. Cover it closely,  and after it has come to a boil, lessen the fire, and let the meat  only simmer for two hours or more. Before you serve it up, pour  the liquid over it.    This dish will be greatly improved by stewing with it a few slices  of ham, or the remains of a cold ham.    Veal when simply boiled is too insipid. To stew it is much better.      VEAL CUTLETS.    The best cutlets are those taken from the leg or fillet. Cut them  about half an inch thick, and as large as the palm of your hand.  Season them with pepper and salt. Grate some stale bread, and rub  it through a cullender, adding to it chopped sweet marjoram,  grated lemon-peel, and some powdered mace or nutmeg. Spread the  mixture on a large flat dish. Have ready in a pan some beaten egg.  First dip each cutlet into the egg, and then into the seasoning on  the dish, seeing that a sufficient quantity adheres to both sides  of the meat. Melt in your frying-pan, over a quick fire, some  beef-dripping, lard, or fresh butter, and when it boils lay your  cutlets in it, and fry them thoroughly; turning them on both  sides, and taking care that they do not burn. Place them in a  covered dish near the fire, while you finish the gravy in the pan,  by first skimming it, and then shaking in a little flour and  stirring it round. Pour the gravy hot round the cutlets, and  garnish with little bunches of curled parsley.    You may mix with the bread crumbs a little saffron.      VEAL STEAKS.    Cut a neck of veal into thin steaks, and beat them to make them  tender. For seasoning, mix together some finely chopped onion  sprinkled with pepper and salt, and a little chopped parsley. Add  some butter, and put it with the parsley and onion into a small  sauce-pan, and set it on hot coals to stew till brown. In the  mean, time, put the steaks on a hot gridiron (the bars of which  have been rubbed with suet) and broil them well, over a bed of  bright clear coals. When sufficiently done on one side turn them  on the other. After the last turning, cover each steak with some  of the seasoning from the sauce-pan, and let all broil together  till thoroughly done.    Instead of the onions and parsley, you may season the veal steaks  with chopped mushrooms, or with chopped oysters, browned in  butter.    Have ready a gravy made of the scraps and trimmings of the veal,  seasoned with pepper and salt, and boiled in a little hot water in  the same sauce-pan in which the parsley and onions have been  previously stewed. Strain the gravy when it has boiled long  enough, and flavour it with catchup.      MINCED VEAL.    Take some cold veal, cut it into slices, and mince it very finely  with a chopping-knife. Season it to your taste with pepper, salt,  sweet marjoram rubbed fine, grated lemon-peel and nutmeg. Put the  bones and trimmings into a sauce-pan with a little water, and  simmer them over hot coals to extract the gravy from them. Then  put the minced veal into a stew-pan, strain the gravy over it, add  a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a little milk or cream. Let  it all simmer together till thoroughly warmed, but do not allow it  to boil lest the meat having been once cooked already, should  become tasteless. When you serve it up, have ready some three-cornered  pieces of bread toasted and buttered; place them all  round the inside of the dish.    Or you may cover the mince with a thick layer of grated bread,  moistened with a little butter, and browned on the top with a  salamander, or a red hot shovel.      VEAL PATTIES.    Mince very fine a pound of the lean of cold roast veal, and half a  pound of cold boiled ham, (fat and lean equally mixed.) Put it  into a stew-pan with three ounces of butter divided into bits and  rolled in flour, a jill of cream, and a jill of veal gravy. Season  it to your taste with cayenne pepper and nutmeg, grated lemon-peel,  and lemon-juice. Set the pan on hot coals, and let the  ingredients simmer till well warmed, stirring them well to prevent  their burning.    Have ready baked some small shells of puff-paste. Fill them with  the mixture, and eat the patties either warm or cold.      VEAL PIE.    Take two pounds of veal cut from the loin, fillet, or the best end  of the neck. Remove the bone, fat, and skin, and put them into a  sauce-pan with half a pint of water to stew for the gravy. Make a  good paste, allowing a pound of butter to two pounds of flour.  Divide it into two pieces, roll it out rather thick and cover with  one piece the sides and bottom of a deep dish. Put in a layer of  veal, seasoned with pepper and salt, then a layer of cold ham  sliced thin, then more veal, more ham, and so on till the dish is  full; interspersing the meat with yolks of eggs boiled hard. If  you can procure some small button mushrooms they will be found an  improvement. Pour in, at the last, the gravy you have drawn from  the trimmings, and put on the lid of the pie, notching the edge  handsomely, and ornamenting the centre with a flower made of  paste.

Before long Hermes' right foot was found  imbedded in the clay. Its sandal still shone with the gilding put on two  thousand years before. Workmen were tearing down one of the houses of  the little town that had been built on the ancient ruins. Every stone in  it had some old story. Pieces of fluted columns, carved capitals, broken  pedestals, blocks from the temple of Zeus--all were cemented together to  make these walls. The workmen pulled and chipped and lifted out piece  after piece. The excavators studied each scrap to see whether it was  valuable. And at last they found a baby's body. They carefully broke off  the mortar. It was of creamy marble, beautifully carved. They carried it  to Hermes. It fitted upon the drapery over his arm. On a rubbish heap  outside the temple they had found a little marble head. They put it upon  this baby's shoulders. It was badly broken, but they could see that it  belonged there. So after two thousand years Hermes again smiled into the  eyes of the baby Dionysus.    Other things were found. The shattered Victory was uncovered. Carefully  the excavators fitted the pieces together. But the wide wings could  never be made again, and the head was ruined. Even so, the statue is a  beautiful thing, with its thin drapery flying in the wind.    After five years the work was finished. Now again hundreds of visitors  journey to Olympia every year. They see no gleaming roofs and  high-lifted statues and joyful games. They walk among sad ruins. But  they can tread the gymnasium floor where Creon and many another victor  wrestled. They can enter the gate of the grass-grown stadion. They can  see the fallen columns of the temple of Zeus. In the museum they can see  the statues of its pediments and, at the end of the long hall, they  see Victory stepping toward them. They can wander on the banks of the  Kladeos and the Alpheios. They can climb Mount Kronion and see the whole  little plain and imagine it gay with tents and moving people.    All these things are interesting to those who like the old Greek life.  But most people make the long journey only to see Hermes. In the museum,  in a little room all alone, he stands, always calm and lovable, always  dreaming of something beautiful, always half smiling at the coaxing  baby.          PICTURES OF OLYMPIA      ENTRANCE TO STADION.    This was not the gate where Charmides entered. This entrance was  reserved for the judges, the competitors, and the heralds. Inside there  were seats for forty-five thousand people. On one side the hill made a  natural slope for seats. But on the other sides a ridge of earth had to  be built up. The track was about two hundred yards long. Only the two  ends have been excavated. The rest still lies deep under the sand.      GYMNASIUM.    Here Creon and the other boys spent a month in training before the  games. The gymnasium had a covered portico as long as the track in the  stadion, where the boys could run in bad weather. A Greek boy of to-day  is playing on his shepherd's pipes in the foreground, and they are the  same kind of pipes on which the old Greeks played.      BOYS IN GYMNASIUM.    From a vase painting. They are wrestling, jumping with weights, throwing  the spear, throwing the discus, while their teachers watch them. One man  is saying, \"A beautiful boy, truly.\"      THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS.    When we see a picture of fallen broken columns lying about a field  in disorder, we try to learn how the original building looked and to  imagine it in all its beauty. This, men believe, is the way the Temple  of Zeus looked. The figures in the pediment were all of Parian marble.  In the center stands Zeus himself. A chariot race is about to be run,  and the contestants stand on either side of Zeus. Zeus gave the victory  to Pelops, and Pelops became husband of Hippodameia, and king of Pisa,  and founded the Olympic Games. These games were held every fourth year  for more than a thousand years.      Note: This and the following plates of the Labors of Herakles and the    statue of Victory, were photographed from Curtius and Adler's    \"Olympia: Die Ergebnisse der von dem Deutschen Reich Veranstalteten    Ausgrabung,\" etc. This is one of the most beautiful books ever made    for a buried city.    Boys and girls who can reach the Metropolitan Museum Library should not  miss it. It is in many volumes, each almost as large as the top of the  table, and you do not need to read German to appreciate the plates.      THE LABORS OF HERAKLES.    Under the porches of the Temple of Zeus were twelve pictures in marble,  six at each end, showing the Labors of Herakles. Herakles was highly  honored at Olympia and, according to one tale, he, instead of Pelops,  was the founder of the Olympic Games.    [Illustration: Herakles and the Nemean lion.--_Metropolitan Museum_]    [Illustration: Herakles and the hydra.--_Metropolitan Museum_]      THE STATUE OF VICTORY.    In the sand, not far from the Temple of Zeus, the explorers found the  fragments of this statue. It shows the goddess flying down from heaven  to bring victory to the men of Messene and Naupaktos. So the victors  must have erected this statue at Olympia in gratitude.    Something like the picture used as the frontispiece, men believe the  statue looked originally. It stood upon a base thirty feet high so that  the goddess really looked as if she were descending from heaven.      THE TEMPLE OF HERA.    This shows the ruins of the temple where Charmides saw the statue of  Hermes, perhaps the most beautiful statue in the world.      HEAD OF AN ATHLETE.    The Greek artist who made this statue believed that a beautiful body is  glorious, as well as a beautiful mind, and a fine spirit. Do you  think his statue shows all these things? The original is now at the  Metropolitan Museum.      A GREEK HORSEMAN.    The artist had great skill who could chisel out of marble such a strong,  bold rider, and such a spirited horse.      This picture and the one before it are not pictures of things found at    Olympia. They are two of the most beautiful statues of Greek athletes,    and we give them to remind you of the sort of people who came to the    games at Olympia.            MYCENAE      HOW A LOST CITY WAS FOUND    Thirty years ago a little group of people stood on a hill in Greece. The  hilltop was covered with soft soil. The summer sun had dried the grass  and flowers, but little bushes grew thick over the ground. In this way  the hill was like an ordinary hill, but all around the edge of it ran  the broken ring of a great wall. In some places it stood thirty feet  above the earth. Here and there it was twenty feet thick. It was built  of huge stones. At one place a tower stood up. In another two stone  lions stood on guard. It was these ruined walls that interested the  people on the hill. One of the men was a Greek. A red fez was on his  head. He wore an embroidered jacket and loose white sleeves. A stiff  kilted skirt hung to his knees. He was pointing about at the wall and  talking in Greek to a lady and gentleman. They were visitors, come to  see these ruins of Mycenae.    \"Once, long, long ago,\" he was saying, \"a great city was inside these  walls. Giants built the walls. See the huge stones. Only giants could  lift them. It was a city of giants. See their great ovens.\"    He pointed down the hill at a doorway in the earth. \"You cannot see well  from here. I will take you down. We can look in. A great dome, built of  stone, is buried in the earth. A passage leads into it, but it is filled  with dirt. We can look down through the broken top. The room inside is  bigger than my whole house. There giants used to bake their bread. Once  a wicked Turk came here. He was afraid of nothing. He said, 'The giants'  treasure lies in this oven. I will have it.' So he sent men down. But  they found only broken pieces of carved marble--no gold.\"    While the guide talked, the gentleman was tramping about the walls. He  peered into all the dark corners. He thrust a stick into every hole. He  rubbed the stones with his hands. At last he turned to his guide.    \"You are right,\" he said. \"There was once a great city inside these  walls. Houses were crowded together on this hill where we stand. Men and  women walked the streets of a city that is buried under our feet, but  they were not giants. They were beautiful women and handsome men.    \"It was a famous old city, this Mycenae. Poets sang songs about her. I  have read those old songs. They tell of Agamemnon, its king, and his  war against Troy. They call him the king of men. They tell of his  gold-decked palace and his rich treasures and the thick walls of his  city.    \"But Agamemnon died, and weak kings sat in his palace. The warriors of  Mycenae grew few, and after hundreds of years, when the city was old and  weak, her enemies conquered her. They broke her walls, they threw down  her houses, they drove out her people. Mycenae became a mass of empty  ruins. For two thousand years the dry winds of summer blew dust over her  palace floors. The rains of winter and spring washed down mud from her  acropolis into her streets and houses. Winged seeds flew into the cracks  of her walls and into the corners of her ruined buildings. There they  sprouted and grew, and at last flowers and grass covered the ruins.  Now only these broken walls remain. You feed your sheep in the city of  Agamemnon. Down there on the hillside farmers have planted grain above  ancient palaces. But I will uncover this wonderful city. You shall see!  You shall see how your ancestors lived.    \"Oh! for years I have longed to see this place. When I was a little boy  in Germany my father told me the old stories of Troy, and he told me of  how great cities were buried. My heart burned to see them. Then, one  night, I heard a man recite some of the lines of Homer. I loved the  beautiful Greek words. I made him say"]]]
