Then I set the lever at  high speed and as the blacks came yelling upon us I slipped from the  craft's deck and with drawn long-sword met the attack.    At the same moment a girl's shriek rang out behind me and an instant  later, as the blacks fell upon me.  I heard far above my head, and  faintly, in Thuvia's voice: \"My Prince, O my Prince; I would rather  remain and die with--\" But the rest was lost in the noise of my  assailants.    I knew though that my ruse had worked and that temporarily at least  Thuvia and Tars Tarkas were safe, and the means of escape was theirs.    For a moment it seemed that I could not withstand the weight of numbers  that confronted me, but again, as on so many other occasions when I had  been called upon to face fearful odds upon this planet of warriors and  fierce beasts, I found that my earthly strength so far transcended that  of my opponents that the odds were not so greatly against me as they  appeared.    My seething blade wove a net of death about me.  For an instant the  blacks pressed close to reach me with their shorter swords, but  presently they gave back, and the esteem in which they suddenly had  learned to hold my sword arm was writ large upon each countenance.    I knew though that it was but a question of minutes before their  greater numbers would wear me down, or get around my guard.  I must go  down eventually to certain death before them.  I shuddered at the  thought of it, dying thus in this terrible place where no word of my  end ever could reach my Dejah Thoris.  Dying at the hands of nameless  black men in the gardens of the cruel therns.    Then my old-time spirit reasserted itself.  The fighting blood of my  Virginian sires coursed hot through my veins.  The fierce blood lust  and the joy of battle surged over me.  The fighting smile that has  brought consternation to a thousand foemen touched my lips.  I put the  thought of death out of my mind, and fell upon my antagonists with fury  that those who escaped will remember to their dying day.    That others would press to the support of those who faced me I knew, so  even as I fought I kept my wits at work, searching for an avenue of  escape.    It came from an unexpected quarter out of the black night behind me.  I  had just disarmed a huge fellow who had given me a desperate struggle,  and for a moment the blacks stood back for a breathing spell.    They eyed me with malignant fury, yet withal there was a touch of  respect in their demeanour.    \"Thern,\" said one, \"you fight like a Dator.  But for your detestable  yellow hair and your white skin you would be an honour to the First  Born of Barsoom.\"    \"I am no thern,\" I said, and was about to explain that I was from  another world, thinking that by patching a truce with these fellows and  fighting with them against the therns I might enlist their aid in  regaining my liberty.  But just at that moment a heavy object smote me  a resounding whack between my shoulders that nearly felled me to the  ground.    As I turned to meet this new enemy an object passed over my shoulder,  striking one of my assailants squarely in the face and knocking him  senseless to the sward.  At the same instant I saw that the thing that  had struck us was the trailing anchor of a rather fair-sized air  vessel; possibly a ten man cruiser.    The ship was floating slowly above us, not more than fifty feet over  our heads.  Instantly the one chance for escape that it offered  presented itself to me.  The vessel was slowly rising and now the  anchor was beyond the blacks who faced me and several feet above their  heads.    With a bound that left them gaping in wide-eyed astonishment I sprang  completely over them.  A second leap carried me just high enough to  grasp the now rapidly receding anchor.    But I was successful, and there I hung by one hand, dragging through  the branches of the higher vegetation of the gardens, while my late  foemen shrieked and howled beneath me.    Presently the vessel veered toward the west and then swung gracefully  to the south.  In another instant I was carried beyond the crest of the  Golden Cliffs, out over the Valley Dor, where, six thousand feet below  me, the Lost Sea of Korus lay shimmering in the moonlight.    Carefully I climbed to a sitting posture across the anchor's arms.  I  wondered if by chance the vessel might be deserted.  I hoped so.  Or  possibly it might belong to a friendly people, and have wandered by  accident almost within the clutches of the pirates and the therns.  The  fact that it was retreating from the scene of battle lent colour to  this hypothesis.    But I decided to know positively, and at once, so, with the greatest  caution, I commenced to climb slowly up the anchor chain toward the  deck above me.    One hand had just reached for the vessel's rail and found it when a  fierce black face was thrust over the side and eyes filled with  triumphant hate looked into mine.          CHAPTER VII    A FAIR GODDESS      For an instant the black pirate and I remained motionless, glaring into  each other's eyes.  Then a grim smile curled the handsome lips above  me, as an ebony hand came slowly in sight from above the edge of the  deck and the cold, hollow eye of a revolver sought the centre of my  forehead.    Simultaneously my free hand shot out for the black throat, just within  reach, and the ebony finger tightened on the trigger.  The pirate's  hissing, \"Die, cursed thern,\" was half choked in his windpipe by my  clutching fingers.  The hammer fell with a futile click upon an empty  chamber.    Before he could fire again I had pulled him so far over the edge of the  deck that he was forced to drop his firearm and clutch the rail with  both hands.    My grasp upon his throat effectually prevented any outcry, and so we  struggled in grim silence; he to tear away from my hold, I to drag him  over to his death.    His face was taking on a livid hue, his eyes were bulging from their  sockets.  It was evident to him that he soon must die unless he tore  loose from the steel fingers that were choking the life from him.  With  a final effort he threw himself further back upon the deck, at the same  instant releasing his hold upon the rail to tear frantically with both  hands at my fingers in an effort to drag them from his throat.    That little second was all that I awaited.  With one mighty downward  surge I swept him clear of the deck.  His falling body came near to  tearing me from the frail hold that my single free hand had upon the  anchor chain and plunging me with him to the waters of the sea below.    I did not relinquish my grasp upon him, however, for I knew that a  single shriek from those lips as he hurtled to his death in the silent  waters of the sea would bring his comrades from above to avenge him.    Instead I held grimly to him, choking, ever choking, while his frantic  struggles dragged me lower and lower toward the end of the chain.    Gradually his contortions became spasmodic, lessening by degrees until  they ceased entirely.  Then I released my hold upon him and in an  instant he was swallowed by the black shadows far below.    Again I climbed to the ship's rail.  This time I succeeded in raising  my eyes to the level of the deck, where I could take a careful survey  of the conditions immediately confronting me.    The nearer moon had passed below the horizon, but the clear effulgence  of the further satellite bathed the deck of the cruiser, bringing into  sharp relief the bodies of six or eight black men sprawled about in  sleep.    Huddled close to the base of a rapid fire gun was a young white girl,  securely bound.  Her eyes were widespread in an expression of horrified  anticipation and fixed directly upon me as I came in sight above the  edge of the deck.    Unutterable relief instantly filled them as if they fell upon the mystic  jewel which sparkled in the centre of my stolen headpiece.  She did not  speak.  Instead her eyes warned me to beware the sleeping figures that  surrounded her.    Noiselessly I gained the deck.  The girl nodded to me to approach her.  As I bent low she whispered to me to release her.    \"I can aid you,\" she said, \"and you will need all the aid available  when they awaken.\"    \"Some of them will awake in Korus,\" I replied smiling.    She caught the meaning of my words, and the cruelty of her answering  smile horrified me.  One is not astonished by cruelty in a hideous  face, but when it touches the features of a goddess whose  fine-chiselled lineaments might more fittingly portray love and beauty,  the contrast is appalling.    Quickly I released her.    \"Give me a revolver,\" she whispered.  \"I can use that upon those your  sword does not silence in time.\"    I did as she bid.  Then I turned toward the distasteful work that lay  before me.  This was no time for fine compunctions, nor for a chivalry  that these cruel demons would neither appreciate nor reciprocate.    Stealthily I approached the nearest sleeper.  When he awoke he was well  on his journey to the bosom of Korus.  His piercing shriek as  consciousness returned to him came faintly up to us from the black  depths beneath.    The second awoke as I touched him, and, though I succeeded in hurling  him from the cruiser's deck, his wild cry of alarm brought the  remaining pirates to their feet.  There were five of them.    As they arose the girl's revolver spoke in sharp staccato and one sank  back to the deck again to rise no more.    The others rushed madly upon me with drawn swords.  The girl evidently  dared not fire for fear of wounding me, but I saw her sneak stealthily  and cat-like toward the flank of the attackers.  Then they were on me.    For a few minutes I experienced some of the hottest fighting I had ever  passed through.  The quarters were too small for foot work.  It was  stand your ground and give and take.  At first I took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#14)"],[1,"prisoners as we would, and make them travel with us, and carry  our baggage. As soon as I proposed it, our men were all of my mind; and  accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows, and let them  know they must go with us; which they seemed very willing to do. But  the next question we had among ourselves, was, how we should do to trust  them, for we found the people not like those of Madagascar, but fierce,  revengeful, and treacherous; for which reason we were sure that we  should have no service from them but that of mere slaves; no subjection  that would continue any longer than the fear of us was upon them, nor  any labour but by violence.    Before I go any farther, I must hint to the reader, that from this time  forward I began to enter a little more seriously into the circumstance  I was in, and concerned myself more in the conduct of our affairs; for  though my comrades were all older men, yet I began to find them void of  counsel, or, as I now call it, presence of mind, when they came to the  execution of a thing. The first occasion I took to observe this, was in  their late engagement with the natives, when, though they had taken a  good resolution to attack them and fire upon them, yet, when they had  fired the first time, and found that the negroes did not run as they  expected, their hearts began to fail, and I am persuaded, if their bark  had been near hand, they would every man have run away.    Upon this occasion I began to take upon me a little to hearten them  up, and to call upon them to load again, and give them another volley,  telling them that I would engage, if they would be ruled by me, I'd make  the negroes run fast enough. I found this heartened them, and therefore,  when they fired a second time, I desired them to reserve some of their  shot for an attempt by itself, as I mentioned above.    Having fired a second time, I was indeed forced to command, as I may  call it. \"Now, seigniors,\" said I, \"let us give them a cheer.\" So I  opened my throat, and shouted three times, as our English sailors do on  like occasions. \"And now follow me,\" said I to the seven that had not  fired, \"and I'll warrant you we will make work with them,\" and so it  proved indeed; for, as soon as they saw us coming, away they ran, as  above.    From this day forward they would call me nothing but Seignior Capitanio;  but I told them I would not be called seignior. \"Well, then,\" said the  gunner, who spoke good English, \"you shall be called Captain Bob;\" and  so they gave me my title ever after.    Nothing is more certain of the Portuguese than this, take them  nationally or personally, if they are animated and heartened up by  anybody to go before, and encourage them by example, they will behave  well enough; but if they have nothing but their own measures to follow,  they sink immediately: these men had certainly fled from a parcel of  naked savages, though even by flying they could not have saved their  lives, if I had not shouted and hallooed, and rather made sport with the  thing than a fight, to keep up their courage.    Nor was there less need of it upon several occasions hereafter; and I do  confess I have often wondered how a number of men, who, when they came  to the extremity, were so ill supported by their own spirits, had  at first courage to propose and to undertake the most desperate and  impracticable attempt that ever men went about in the world.    There were indeed two or three indefatigable men among them, by whose  courage and industry all the rest were upheld; and indeed those two or  three were the managers of them from the beginning; that was the gunner,  and that cutler whom I call the artist; and the third, who was pretty  well, though not like either of them, was one of the carpenters. These  indeed were the life and soul of all the rest, and it was to their  courage that all the rest owed the resolution they showed upon any  occasion. But when those saw me take a little upon me, as above, they  embraced me, and treated me with particular affection ever after.    This gunner was an excellent mathematician, a good scholar, and a  complete sailor; and it was in conversing intimately with him that I  learned afterwards the grounds of what knowledge I have since had in all  the sciences useful for navigation, and particularly in the geographical  part of knowledge.    Even in our conversation, finding me eager to understand and learn, he  laid the foundation of a general knowledge of things in my mind, gave  me just ideas of the form of the earth and of the sea, the situation of  countries, the course of rivers, the doctrine of the spheres, the motion  of the stars; and, in a word, taught me a kind of system of astronomy,  which I afterwards improved.    In an especial manner, he filled my head with aspiring thoughts, and  with an earnest desire after learning everything that could be taught  me; convincing me, that nothing could qualify me for great undertakings,  but a degree of learning superior to what was usual in the race of  seamen; he told me, that to be ignorant was to be certain of a  mean station in the world, but that knowledge was the first step to  preferment. He was always flattering me with my capacity to learn; and  though that fed my pride, yet, on the other hand, as I had a secret  ambition, which just at that time fed itself in my mind, it prompted in  me an insatiable thirst after learning in general, and I resolved, if  ever I came back to Europe, and had anything left to purchase it, I  would make myself master of all the parts of learning needful to  the making of me a complete sailor; but I was not so just to myself  afterwards as to do it when I had an opportunity.    But to return to our business; the gunner, when he saw the service I  had done in the fight, and heard my proposal for keeping a number of  prisoners for our march, and for carrying our baggage, turns to me  before them all. \"Captain Bob,\" says he, \"I think you must be our  leader, for all the success of this enterprise is owing to you.\" \"No,  no,\" said I, \"do not compliment me; you shall be our Seignior Capitanio,  you shall be general; I am too young for it.\" So, in short, we all  agreed he should be our leader; but he would not accept of it alone, but  would have me joined with him; and all the rest agreeing, I was obliged  to comply.    The first piece of service they put me upon in this new command was  as difficult as any they could think of, and that was to manage the  prisoners; which, however, I cheerfully undertook, as you shall hear  presently. But the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence;  and that was, first, which way we should go; and secondly, how to  furnish ourselves for the voyage with provisions.    There was among the prisoners one tall, well-shaped, handsome fellow,  to whom the rest seemed to pay great respect, and who, as we understood  afterwards, was the son of one of their kings; his father was, it seems,  killed at our first volley, and he wounded with a shot in his arm, and  with another just on one of his hips or haunches. The shot in his haunch  being in a fleshy part, bled much, and he was half dead with the loss of  blood. As to the shot in his arm, it had broke his wrist, and he was by  both these wounds quite disabled, so that we were once going to turn him  away, and let him die; and, if we had, he would have died indeed in a  few days more: but, as I found the man had some respect showed him, it  presently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful  to us, and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them. So I caused  our surgeon to take him in hand, and gave the poor wretch good words,  that is to say, I spoke to him as well as I could by signs, to make him  understand that we would make him well again.    This created a new awe in their minds of us, believing that, as we could  kill at a distance by something invisible to them (for so our shot was,  to be sure), so we could make them well again too. Upon this the young  prince (for so we called him afterwards) called six or seven of the  savages to him, and said something to them; what it was we know not, but  immediately all the seven came to me, and kneeled down to me, holding up  their hands, and making signs of entreaty, pointing to the place where  one of those lay whom we had killed.    It was a long time before I or any of us could understand them; but one  of them ran and lifted up a dead man, pointing to his wound, which was  in his eyes, for he was shot into the head at one of his eyes. Then  another pointed to the surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the  meaning was, that he should heal the prince's father too, who was dead,  being shot through the head, as above.    We presently took the hint, and would not say we could not do it, but  let them know, the men that were killed were those that had first fallen  upon us, and provoked us, and we would by no means make them alive  again; and that, if any others did so, we would kill them too, and never  let them live any more: but that, if he (the prince) would be willing  to go with us, and do as we should direct him, we would not let him die,  and would make his arm well. Upon this he bid his men go and fetch a  long stick or staff, and lay on the ground. When they brought it, we saw  it was an arrow; he took it with his left hand (for his other was lame  with the wound), and, pointing up at the sun, broke the arrow in two,  and set the point against his breast, and then gave it to me. This was,  as I understood afterwards, wishing the sun, whom they worship, might  shoot him into the breast with an arrow, if ever he failed to be my  friend; and giving the point of the arrow to me was to be a testimony  that I was the man he had sworn to: and never was Christian more  punctual to an oath than he was to this, for he was a sworn servant to  us for many a weary month after that.    When I brought him"]]]
