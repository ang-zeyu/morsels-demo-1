The District Attorney had sent  everywhere, as far even as Illinois, for witness with regard to that  marriage. It seemed as if all Vermont was against me. I have heard that  with the cost of witnesses and other expenses, my trial cost the state  more than five thousand dollars. My three lawyers could not save me.  After a week's trial the case went to the jury, and in four hours they  returned a verdict of \"guilty.\"    My counsel instantly appealed the case to the Supreme Court, and,  meanwhile I went back to jail where I remained three months more. A few  days after I returned to jail a friend of mine managed to furnish me  with files and saws, and I went industriously to work at the gratings  of my window to saw my way out. I could work only at night, when the  keepers were away, and I covered the traces of my cuttings by filling in  with tallow. In two months I had everything in readiness for my escape.  An hour's more sawing at the bars would set me free. But just at that  time the Governor of the State, Fletcher, made a visit to the jail.  I told him all about my case. He assured me, after hearing all the  circumstances, that if I should be convicted and sentenced, he would  surely pardon me in the course of six or eight weeks. Trusting in this  promise, I made no further effort to escape though I could have done  so easily any night; but rather than run the risk of recapture, and a  heavier sentence if I should be convicted, I awaited the chances of the  court, and looked beyond for the clemency of the Governor.    Well, finally my case came up in the Supreme Court. It only occupied  a day, and the result was that I was sentenced for three years in the  State prison. I was remanded to jail, and five days from that time I was  taken from Montpelier to Windsor.        CHAPTER X. PRISON-LIFE IN VERMONT.    ENTERING PRISON--THE SCYTHE SNATH BUSINESS--BLISTERED HANDS--I  LEARN NOTHING--THREAT TO KILL THE SHOP--KEEPER--LOCKSMITHING--OPEN  REBELLION--SIX WEEKS IN THE DUNGEON--ESCAPE OF A PRISONER--IN THE  DUNGEON AGAIN--THE MAD MAN, HALL--HE ATTEMPTS TO MURDER THE DEPUTY--I  SAVE MOREY'S LIFE--HOWLING IN THE BLACK HOLE--TAKING OFF HALL'S  IRONS--A GHASTLY SPECTACLE--A PRISON FUNERAL--I AM LET ALONE--BETTER  TREATMENT--THE FULL TERM OF MY IMPRISONMENT.        We arrived at Windsor and I was safely inside of the prison at three  o'clock in the afternoon. Warden Harlow met me with a joke, to the  effect that, had it not been for my handcuffs he should have taken the  officer who brought me, to be the prisoner, I was so much the better  dressed of the two. He then talked very seriously to me for a long time.  He was sorry, and surprised, he said, to see a man of my appearance  brought to such a place for such a crime; he could not understand how a  person of my evident intelligence should get into such a scrape.    I told him that he understood it as well as I did, at all events; that  I could not conceive why I should get into these difficulties, one  after the other; but that I believed I was a crazy man on this one  subject--matrimonial monomania; that when I had gone through with one  of these scrapes, and had suffered the severe punishment that was almost  certain to follow, the whole was like a dream to me--a nightmare and  nothing more. With regard to what was before me in this prison I  should try and behave myself, and make the best of the situation; but I  notified the Warden that I did not mean to do one bit of work if I could  help it.    He took me inside, where my fine clothes were taken away, and I. was  dressed in the usual particolored prison uniform. I was told the rules,  and was warned that if I did not observe them it would go hard with  me. Then followed twenty-four hours solitary confinement, and the next  afternoon I was taken from my cell to a shop in which scythe snaths were  made.    It had transpired during my trial at Montpelier, that when I was a young  man, I was a blacksmith by trade. This information had been transmitted  to prison and I was at once put to work making heel rings. It was some  years since I had worked at a forge and handled a hammer. Consequently,  in three or four days, my hands were terribly blistered, and as the  Warden happened to come into the shop, I showed them to him, and quietly  told him that I would do that work no longer. He told me that I must do  it; he would make me do it. I answered that he might kill me, or punish  me in any way he pleased, but he could not make me do that kind of  labor, and I threw down my hammer and refused to work a moment longer.    The Warden left me and sent Deputy Warden Morey to try me. He approached  me in a kindly way, and I showed my blistered hands to him. He thought  that was the way to \"toughen\" me. I thought not, and said so, and,  moreover, told him I would never make another heel ring in that prison,  and I never did.    He sent me to my cell and I stayed there a week, till my hands were  well. Then the Deputy came to me and asked me if I was willing to learn  to hew out scythe snaths in the rough for the shavers, who finished  them? I said I would try. I went into the shop and was shown how the  work was to be done. Every man was expected to hew out fifty snaths in a  day. In three or four days the shop-keeper came and overlooked me while  I was working in my bungling way, and said if I couldn't do better than  that I must clear out of his shop and do something else. My reply was  that I did not understand the business, and had no desire or intention  to learn it. He sent for the Deputy Warden, who came and expressed  the opinion that I could not do anything. I said I was willing to do  anything I could understand.    \"Do you understand anything?\" asked the Deputy.    \"Well, some things, marrying for instance,\" was my answer.    \"I want no joking or blackguardism about this matter,\" said the Deputy;  \"them simple fact is, you've got to work; if you don't we'll make you.\"    So I kept on at hewing, making no improvement, and in a day or two  more the shopkeeper undertook to show me how the work should be done. I  protested I never could learn it.    \"You don't try; and I have a good mind to punish you.\"    The moment the shop-keeper said it I dropped the snath, raised my  axe, and told him that if he came one step nearer to me I would make  mincemeat of him. He thought it was advisable to stay where he was; but  one of the prison-keepers was in the shop, and as he came toward me I  warned him that he had better keep away.    All the men in the shop were ready to break out in insubordination; when  I threatened the shop keeper and the guard, they cheered; the Deputy  Warden was soon on the ground; he stood in the doorway a moment, and  then, in a kind tone called me to him. I had no immediate quarrel with  him, and so I dropped my axe and went to him. He told me that there  was no use of \"making a muss\" there, it incited the other prisoners to  insubordination, and was sure to bring severe punishment upon myself.  \"Go and get your cap and coat,\" said he \"and come with me.\"    \"But if you are going to put me into that black hole of yours,\" I  exclaimed, \"I won't go; you'll have to draw me there or kill me on the  way.\"    He promised he would not put me in the dungeon, he was only going to  put me in my cell, he said, and to my cell I went, willingly enough,  and stayed there a week, during which time I suppose everyone of my  shopmates thought I was in the dungeon, undergoing severe punishment for  my rebellions conduct.    I had learned now the worst lesson which a prisoner can learn--that is,  that my keepers were afraid of me. To a limited extent, it is true, I  was now my own master and keeper. In a few days Deputy Morey came to  me and asked me if I was \"willing\" to come out and work. I was sick  of solitary confinement, and longed to see the faces of men, even  prisoners: so I told him if I could get any work I could do I was  willing to try it, and would do as well as I knew how. He asked me if I  knew anything of locksmithing? I told him I had some taste for it, and  if he would show me his job I would let him see what I could do.    The fact is, I was a very fair amateur locksmith, and had quite  a fondness for fixing, picking, and fussing generally over locks.  Accordingly, when he gave me a lock to work upon to make it \"play  easier,\" as he described it, I did the job so satisfactorily that I had  nearly every lock in the prison to take off and operate upon, if it was  nothing more than to clean and oil one. This business occupied my  entire time and attention for nearly three months. Then I repaired iron  bedsteads, did other iron work, and I was the general tinker of the  prison.    It came into my head, however, one day, that I might as well do nothing.  The prison fare was indescribably bad, almost as bad as the jail fare at  Easton. We lived upon the poorest possible salt beef for dinner, varied  now and then with plucks and such stuff from the slaughter houses, with  nothing but bread and rye coffee for breakfast and supper, and mush and  molasses perhaps twice a week.    I was daily abused, too, by the Warden, his Deputy, and his keepers.  They looked upon me as an ugly, insubordinate, refractory, rebellious  rascal, who was ready to kill any of them, and, worst of all, who would  not work. I determined to confirm their minds in the latter supposition,  and so one day I threw down my tools and refused to do another thing.    They dragged me to the dungeon and thrust me in. It was a wretched dark  hole, with a little dirty straw in one corner to lie upon. My entire  food and drink was bread and water. The man who brought it never spoke  to me. His face was the only one I saw during the livelong day. Day and  night were alike to me; I lost the run of time; but at long intervals,  once in eight or ten days, I suppose, the Deputy came to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#14)"],[1,"to meet the expense of maintaining their  business[36].    The steamer schedule was about four weeks in either direction, and the  rapidly increasing population of California soon demanded, in the early  fifties, a faster and more frequent service. Agitation to that end was  thus started, and during the last days of Pierce's administration, in  March 1857, the \"Overland Mail\" bill was passed by Congress and signed  by the President. This act provided that the Postmaster-General should  advertise for bids until June 30 following: \"for the conveyance of the  entire letter mail from such point on the Mississippi River as the  contractors may select to San Francisco, Cal., for six years, at a cost  not exceeding $300,000 per annum for semi-monthly, $450,000 for weekly,  or $600,000 for semi-weekly service to be performed semi-monthly,  weekly, or semi-weekly at the option of the Postmaster-General.\" The  specifications also stipulated a twenty-five day schedule, good coaches,  and four-horse teams.    Bids were opened July 1, 1857. Nine were submitted, and most of them  proposed starting from St. Louis, thence going overland in a  southwesterly direction usually via Albuquerque. Only one bid proposed  the more northerly Central route via Independence, Fort Laramie, and  Salt Lake. The Postoffice Department was opposed to this trail, and its  attitude had been confirmed by the troubles of winter travel in the  past. In fact this route had been a failure for six consecutive winters,  due to the deep snows of the high mountains which it crossed.    On July 2, 1857, the Postmaster General announced the acceptance of bid  No. \"12,587\" which stipulated a forked route from St. Louis, Missouri  and from Memphis, Tennessee, the lines converging at Little Rock,  Arkansas. Thence the course was by way of Preston, Texas; or as nearly  as might be found advisable, to the best point in crossing the Rio  Grande above El Paso, and not far from Fort Filmore; thence along the  new road then being opened and constructed by the Secretary of the  Interior to Fort Yuma, California; thence through the best passes and  along the best valleys for safe and expeditious staging to San  Francisco. On September is following, a six year contract was let for  this route. The successful firm at once became known as the \"Butterfield  Overland Mail Company.\" Among the firm members were John Butterfield,  Wm. B. Dinsmore, D. N. Barney, Wm. G. Fargo and Hamilton Spencer. The  extreme length of the route agreed upon from St. Louis to San Francisco  was two thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine miles; the most southern  point was six hundred miles south of South Pass on the old Salt Lake  route. Because of the out-of-the-way southern course followed, two and  one half days more than necessary were nominally-required in making the  journey. Yet the postal authorities believed that this would be more  than offset by the southerly course being to a great extent free from  winter snows.    On September 15, 1858, after elaborate preparations, the overland mails  started from San Francisco and St. Louis on the twenty-five day  schedule--which was three days less than that of the water route. The  postage rate was ten cents for each half ounce; the passenger fare was  one hundred dollars in gold. The first trip was made in twenty-four  days, and in each of the terminal cities big celebrations were held in  honor of the event. And yet today, four splendid lines of railway cover  this distance in about three days!    These stages--to use the west-bound route as an illustration--traveled  in an elliptical course through Springfield, Missouri, and Fayetteville,  Arkansas, to Van Buren, Arkansas, where the Memphis mail was received.  Continuing in a southwesterly course, they passed through Indian  Territory and the Choctaw Indian reserve--now Oklahoma--crossed the  Red River at Calvert's Ferry, then on through Sherman, Fort Chadbourne  and Fort Belknap, Texas, through Guadaloupe Pass to El Paso; thence up  the Rio Grande River through the Mesilla Valley, and into western New  Mexico--now Arizona to Tucson. Then the journey led up the Gila River  to Arizona City, across the Mojave desert in Southern California and  finally through the San Joaquin Valley to San Francisco.    Today a traveler could cover nearly the same route, leaving St. Louis  over the Frisco Railroad, transferring to the Texas Pacific at Fort  Worth, and taking the Southern Pacific at El Paso for the remainder of  the trip.    As has been shown, the outbreak of the Civil War in the spring of 1861  made it necessary for the Federal Government to transfer this big and  important route further north to get it beyond the latitude of the  Confederacy. Hence the Southern route was formally abandoned[37] on  March 12, 1861, and the equipment removed to the Central or Salt Lake  trail where a daily service was inaugurated. About three months was  necessary to move all the outfits and in July 1861, the first daily  overland mail--running six times a week--was started between St.  Joseph and Placerville, California, 1,920 miles by the way of Forts  Kearney, Bridger, and Salt Lake City.    The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad had been built into St. Joseph and  was doing business by February 1859. For some time that city enjoyed the  honor of being the eastern stage terminal; but within a year the  railroad was extended to Atchison, about twenty miles down the stream.  The latter place is situated on a bend of the river fourteen miles west  of St. Joseph, and so the terminal honors soon passed to Atchison since  its westerly location shortened the haul.    In transferring the Butterfield line from the Southern to the Central  route, it was merged with the Central Overland California and Pike's  Peak Express Company which already included the Leavenworth and Pike's  Peak Express Company, under the leadership of General Bela M. Hughes.  This line was known to the Government as the Central Overland California  Route. As soon as the transfer was completed, through California stages  were started on an eighteen day schedule a full week less time than had  been required by the Butterfield route, and ten days less than that of  the Panama steamers. This was the most famous of all the stage routes,  and except for three interruptions, due to Indian outbreaks in 1862,  1864, and 1865, it did business continuously for several years.    Within a few months came another change of proprietorship, the route  passing on a mortgage foreclosure into the hands of Benjamin Holladay, a  famous stage line promoter, late in 1861. Early the following year  Holladay reorganized the management under the name of the Overland Stage  Line. This seems to have been what today is technically known as a  holding company; for until the expiration of the old Butterfield  contract in 1863[38], he allowed the business east of Salt Lake City to  be carried on by the old C. O. C. & P. P. Co.; west of Salt Lake, the  new Overland Line allowed, or sublet the through traffic to a vigorous  subsidiary, the Pioneer Stage Line[39].    Holladay was fortunate in securing a new mail contract for the Central  route which he now controlled. For supplying a six day letter mail  service from the Missouri to Placerville together with a way mail to and  from Denver and Salt Lake City, he was paid $1,000,000 a year for the  three years beginning July 1, 1861. At the expiration of this period he  was to get $840,000.    In the meantime gold was discovered in Idaho and Montana, and Holladay,  encouraged by his big subsidy from the Government, put stage lines into  Virginia City, Montana, and Boise City, Idaho.    In 1866 the Butterfield Overland Despatch, an express and fast freight  line, was started above the Smoky Hill route from Topeka and Leavenworth  across Kansas to Denver. Within a short time this organization, mainly  because of the heavy expense caused by Indian depredations, and was  consolidated with the Holladay Company. Just prior to this transfer, Mr.  Holladay received from the Colorado Territorial legislature a charter  for the \"Holladay Overland Mail and Express Company,\" which was the full  and formal name of the new concern. This corporation now owned and  controlled stage lines aggregating thirty-three hundred miles. It  brought the service up to the highest point of efficiency and used only  the best animals and vehicles it was possible to obtain.    In addition to his federal mail bonus, Holladay had the following rates  for passenger traffic in force:    In 1863, from Atchison to Denver $75.00    In 1863, from Atchison to Salt Lake City $150.00    In 1863, from Atchison to Placerville $225.00    In 1865, on account of the rise of gold and the depreciation of  currency, these rates were increased; the fare from the Missouri River  to Denver was changed to $175.00; to Salt Lake $350.00. The California  rate varied from $400.00 to $500.00. A year later the fare to Virginia  City, Montana, was fixed at $350.00 and the rate to Salt Lake City  reduced to $225.00.    These high rates and Indian dangers did not seem to check the desire on  the part of the public to make the overland trip. Stages were almost  always crowded, and it was usually necessary for one to apply for  reservations several days in advance.    Late in the year 1866, Holladay's entire properties[40] were purchased  by Wells Fargo and Co. This was a new concern, recently chartered by  Colorado, which had been quietly gaining power. Within a short time it  had exclusive control of practically all the stage, express, and  freighting business in the West and this business it held.    Meanwhile the overland stage and freight lines were rapidly shortening  on account of the building of the Pacific railroads, and the terminals  of the through routes became merely the temporary ends of the fast  growing railway lines. By the early autumn of 1866, the Kansas Pacific  had reached "]]]
