Burgess, was a name that leaped from the paper at him. His  own name.          CHAPTER XIII    THE M.C.C. MATCH      If the day happens to be fine, there is a curious, dream-like  atmosphere about the opening stages of a first eleven match.  Everything seems hushed and expectant. The rest of the school have  gone in after the interval at eleven o'clock, and you are alone on the  grounds with a cricket-bag. The only signs of life are a few  pedestrians on the road beyond the railings and one or two blazer and  flannel-clad forms in the pavilion. The sense of isolation is trying  to the nerves, and a school team usually bats 25 per cent. better  after lunch, when the strangeness has worn off.    Mike walked across from Wain's, where he had changed, feeling quite  hollow. He could almost have cried with pure fright. Bob had shouted  after him from a window as he passed Donaldson's, to wait, so that  they could walk over together; but conversation was the last thing  Mike desired at that moment.    He had almost reached the pavilion when one of the M.C.C. team came  down the steps, saw him, and stopped dead.    \"By Jove, Saunders!\" cried Mike.    \"Why, Master Mike!\"    The professional beamed, and quite suddenly, the lost, hopeless  feeling left Mike. He felt as cheerful as if he and Saunders had met  in the meadow at home, and were just going to begin a little quiet  net-practice.    \"Why, Master Mike, you don't mean to say you're playing for the school  already?\"    Mike nodded happily.    \"Isn't it ripping,\" he said.    Saunders slapped his leg in a sort of ecstasy.    \"Didn't I always say it, sir,\" he chuckled. \"Wasn't I right? I used to  say to myself it 'ud be a pretty good school team that 'ud leave you  out.\"    \"Of course, I'm only playing as a sub., you know. Three chaps are in  extra, and I got one of the places.\"    \"Well, you'll make a hundred to-day, Master Mike, and then they'll  have to put you in.\"    \"Wish I could!\"    \"Master Joe's come down with the Club,\" said Saunders.    \"Joe! Has he really? How ripping! Hullo, here he is. Hullo, Joe?\"    The greatest of all the Jacksons was descending the pavilion steps  with the gravity befitting an All England batsman. He stopped short,  as Saunders had done.    \"Mike! You aren't playing!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I'm hanged! Young marvel, isn't he, Saunders?\"    \"He is, sir,\" said Saunders. \"Got all the strokes. I always said it,  Master Joe. Only wants the strength.\"    Joe took Mike by the shoulder, and walked him off in the direction of  a man in a Zingari blazer who was bowling slows to another of the  M.C.C. team. Mike recognised him with awe as one of the three best  amateur wicket-keepers in the country.    \"What do you think of this?\" said Joe, exhibiting Mike, who grinned  bashfully. \"Aged ten last birthday, and playing for the school. You  are only ten, aren't you, Mike?\"    \"Brother of yours?\" asked the wicket-keeper.    \"Probably too proud to own the relationship, but he is.\"    \"Isn't there any end to you Jacksons?\" demanded the wicket-keeper in  an aggrieved tone. \"I never saw such a family.\"    \"This is our star. You wait till he gets at us to-day. Saunders is our  only bowler, and Mike's been brought up on Saunders. You'd better win  the toss if you want a chance of getting a knock and lifting your  average out of the minuses.\"    \"I _have_ won the toss,\" said the other with dignity. \"Do you  think I don't know the elementary duties of a captain?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The school went out to field with mixed feelings. The wicket was hard  and true, which would have made it pleasant to be going in first. On  the other hand, they would feel decidedly better and fitter for  centuries after the game had been in progress an hour or so. Burgess  was glad as a private individual, sorry as a captain. For himself, the  sooner he got hold of the ball and began to bowl the better he liked  it. As a captain, he realised that a side with Joe Jackson on it, not  to mention the other first-class men, was not a side to which he would  have preferred to give away an advantage. Mike was feeling that by no  possibility could he hold the simplest catch, and hoping that nothing  would come his way. Bob, conscious of being an uncertain field, was  feeling just the same.    The M.C.C. opened with Joe and a man in an Oxford Authentic cap. The  beginning of the game was quiet. Burgess's yorker was nearly too much  for the latter in the first over, but he contrived to chop it away,  and the pair gradually settled down. At twenty, Joe began to open his  shoulders. Twenty became forty with disturbing swiftness, and Burgess  tried a change of bowling.    It seemed for one instant as if the move had been a success, for Joe,  still taking risks, tried to late-cut a rising ball, and snicked  it straight into Bob's hands at second slip. It was the easiest  of slip-catches, but Bob fumbled it, dropped it, almost held it a  second time, and finally let it fall miserably to the ground. It was  a moment too painful for words. He rolled the ball back to the bowler  in silence.    One of those weary periods followed when the batsman's defence seems  to the fieldsmen absolutely impregnable. There was a sickening  inevitableness in the way in which every ball was played with the very  centre of the bat. And, as usual, just when things seemed most  hopeless, relief came. The Authentic, getting in front of his wicket,  to pull one of the simplest long-hops ever seen on a cricket field,  missed it, and was l.b.w. And the next ball upset the newcomer's leg  stump.    The school revived. Bowlers and field were infused with a new life.  Another wicket--two stumps knocked out of the ground by Burgess--helped  the thing on. When the bell rang for the end of morning school, five  wickets were down for a hundred and thirteen.    But from the end of school till lunch things went very wrong indeed.  Joe was still in at one end, invincible; and at the other was the  great wicket-keeper. And the pair of them suddenly began to force the  pace till the bowling was in a tangled knot. Four after four, all  round the wicket, with never a chance or a mishit to vary the  monotony. Two hundred went up, and two hundred and fifty. Then Joe  reached his century, and was stumped next ball. Then came lunch.    The rest of the innings was like the gentle rain after the  thunderstorm. Runs came with fair regularity, but wickets fell at  intervals, and when the wicket-keeper was run out at length for a  lively sixty-three, the end was very near. Saunders, coming in last,  hit two boundaries, and was then caught by Mike. His second hit had  just lifted the M.C.C. total over the three hundred.           *       *       *       *       *    Three hundred is a score that takes some making on any ground, but on  a fine day it was not an unusual total for the Wrykyn eleven. Some  years before, against Ripton, they had run up four hundred and  sixteen; and only last season had massacred a very weak team of Old  Wrykynians with a score that only just missed the fourth hundred.    Unfortunately, on the present occasion, there was scarcely time,  unless the bowling happened to get completely collared, to make the  runs. It was a quarter to four when the innings began, and stumps were  to be drawn at a quarter to seven. A hundred an hour is quick work.    Burgess, however, was optimistic, as usual. \"Better have a go for  them,\" he said to Berridge and Marsh, the school first pair.    Following out this courageous advice, Berridge, after hitting three  boundaries in his first two overs, was stumped half-way through the  third.    After this, things settled down. Morris, the first-wicket man, was a  thoroughly sound bat, a little on the slow side, but exceedingly hard  to shift. He and Marsh proceeded to play themselves in, until it  looked as if they were likely to stay till the drawing of stumps.    A comfortable, rather somnolent feeling settled upon the school. A  long stand at cricket is a soothing sight to watch. There was an  absence of hurry about the batsmen which harmonised well with the  drowsy summer afternoon. And yet runs were coming at a fair pace. The  hundred went up at five o'clock, the hundred and fifty at half-past.  Both batsmen were completely at home, and the M.C.C. third-change  bowlers had been put on.    Then the great wicket-keeper took off the pads and gloves, and the  fieldsmen retired to posts at the extreme edge of the ground.    \"Lobs,\" said Burgess. \"By Jove, I wish I was in.\"    It seemed to be the general opinion among the members of the Wrykyn  eleven on the pavilion balcony that Morris and Marsh were in luck. The  team did not grudge them their good fortune, because they had earned  it; but they were distinctly envious.    Lobs are the most dangerous, insinuating things in the world.  Everybody knows in theory the right way to treat them. Everybody knows  that the man who is content not to try to score more than a single  cannot get out to them. Yet nearly everybody does get out to them.    It was the same story to-day. The first over yielded six runs, all  through gentle taps along the ground. In the second, Marsh hit an  over-pitched one along the ground to the terrace bank. The next ball  he swept round to the leg boundary. And that was the end of Marsh. He  saw himself scoring at the rate of twenty-four an over. Off the last  ball he was stumped by several feet, having done himself credit by  scoring seventy.    The long stand was followed, as usual, by a series of disasters.  Marsh's wicket had fallen at a hundred and eighty. Ellerby left at a  hundred and eighty-six. By the time the scoring-board registered two  hundred, five wickets were down, three of them victims to the lobs.  Morris was still in at one end. He had refused to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#14)"],[1,"fierce, and he was very timid.    \"A raccoon, I guess, or a big woodchuck. Won't his fur make a fine cap?  I guess the other fellows will wish they'd come with us.\" said Tommy,  prancing to and fro, without the least idea what to do with the  creature.    \"He'll bite. We'd better run away and wait till he's dead,\" said Billy.    \"Wish he'd got his head in, then I could carry him off; but he does  look savage, so we'll have to leave him awhile, and get him when we come  back. But he's a real beauty.\" And Tommy looked proudly at the bunch of  gray fur scuffling in the sand.    \"Can we ever eat him?\" asked hungry Billy, ready for a fried crocodile  if he could get it.    \"If he's a raccoon, we can; but I don't know about woodchucks. The  fellows in my books don't seem to have caught any. He's nice and fat; we  might try him when he's dead,\" said Tommy, who cared more for the skin  to show than the best meal ever cooked.    The sound of a gun echoing through the wood gave Tommy a good idea,--    \"Let's find the man and get him to shoot this chap; then we needn't  wait, but skin him right away, and eat him too.\"    Off they went to the camp; and catching up their things, the two hunters  hurried away in the direction of the sound, feeling glad to know that  some one was near them, for two or three hours of wood life made them a  little homesick.    They ran and scrambled, and listened and called; but not until they had  gone a long way up the mountain did they find the man, resting in an old  hut left by the lumbermen. The remains of his dinner were spread on the  floor, and he lay smoking, and reading a newspaper, while his dog dozed  at his feet, close to a well-filled game-bag.    He looked surprised when two dirty, wet little boys suddenly appeared  before him,--one grinning cheerfully, the other looking very dismal  and scared as the dog growled and glared at them as if they were two  rabbits.    \"Hollo!\" said the man    \"Hollo!\" answered Tommy.    \"Who are you?\" asked the man.    \"Hunters,\" said Tommy.    \"Had good luck?\" And the man laughed.    \"First-rate. Got a raccoon in our trap, and we want you to come and  shoot him,\" answered Tommy, proudly.    \"Sure?\" said the man, looking interested as well as amused.    \"No, but I think so.\"    \"What's he like?\"    Tommy described him, and was much disappointed when the man lay down  again, saying, with another laugh,--    \"It's a woodchuck; he's no good.\"    \"But I want the skin.\"    \"Then don't shoot him, let him die; that's better for the skin,\" said  the man, who was tired and didn't want to stop for such poor game.    All this time Billy had been staring hard at the sandwiches and bread  and cheese on the floor, and sniffing at them, as the dog sniffed at  him.    \"Want some grub?\" asked the man, seeing the hungry look.    \"I just do! We left our lunch, and I've only had two little trout and  some old berries since breakfast,\" answered Billy, with tears in his  eyes and a hand on his stomach.    \"Eat away then; I'm done, and don't want the stuff.\" And the man took up  his paper as if glad to be let alone.    It was lucky that the dog had been fed, for in ten minutes nothing  was left but the napkin; and the boys sat picking up the crumbs, much  refreshed, but ready for more.    \"Better be going home, my lads; it's pretty cold on the mountain after  sunset, and you are a long way from town,\" said the man, who had peeped  at them over his paper now and then, and saw, in spite of the dirt and  rips, that they were not farmer boys.    \"We don't live in town; we are at Mullin's, in the valley. No hurry;  we know the way, and we want to have some sport first. You seem to  have done well,\" answered Tommy, looking enviously from the gun to the  game-bag, out of which hung a rabbit's head and a squirrel's tail.    \"Pretty fair; but I want a shot at the bear. People tell me there is one  up here, and I'm after him; for he kills the sheep, and might hurt some  of the young folks round here,\" said the man, loading his gun with a  very sober air; for he wanted to get rid of the boys and send them home.    Billy looked alarmed; but Tommy's brown face beamed with joy as he said  eagerly,--    \"I hope you'll get him. I'd rather shoot a bear than any other animal  but a lion. We don't have those here, and bears are scarce. Mullin said  he hadn't heard of one for a long time; so this must be a young one, for  they killed the big one two years ago.\"    That was true, and the man knew it. He did not really expect or want to  meet a bear, but thought the idea of one would send the little fellows  home at once. Finding one of them was unscared, he laughed, and said  with a nod to Tommy,--    \"If I had time I'd take _you_ along, and show you how to hunt; but this  fat friend of yours couldn't rough it with us, and we can't leave him  alone; so go ahead your own way. Only I wouldn't climb any higher, for  among the rocks you are sure to get hurt or lost.\"    \"Oh, I say, let's go! Such fun, Billy! I know you'll like it. A real gun  and dog and hunter! Come on, and don't be a molly-coddle,\" cried Tommy,  wild to go.    \"I won't! I'm tired, and I'm going home; you can go after your old bears  if you want to. I don't think much of hunting anyway, and wish I hadn't  come,\" growled Billy, very cross at being left out, yet with no desire  to scramble any more.    \"Can't stop. Good-by. Get along home, and some day I'll come and take  you out with me, little Leatherstocking,\" said the man, striding off  with the dear gun and dog and bag, leaving Billy to wonder what he meant  by that queer name, and Tommy to console himself with the promise made  him.    \"Let's go and see how old Chucky gets on,\" he said good-naturedly, when  the man vanished.    \"Not till I'm rested. I can get a good nap on this pile of hay; then  we'll go home before it's late,\" answered lazy Billy, settling himself  on the rough bed the lumbermen had used.    \"I just wish I had a boy with some go in him; you ain't much better than  a girl,\" sighed Tommy, walking off to a pine-tree where some squirrels  seemed to be having a party, they chattered and raced up and down at  such a rate.    He tried his bow and shot all his arrows many times in vain, for the  lively creatures gave him no chance. He had better luck with a brown  bird who sat in a bush and was hit full in the breast with the sharpest  arrow. The poor thing fluttered and fell, and its blood wet the green  leaves as it lay dying on the grass. Tommy was much pleased at first;  but as he stood watching its bright eye grow dim and its pretty brown  wings stop fluttering, he felt sorry that its happy little life was so  cruelly ended, and ashamed that his thoughtless fun had given so much  pain.    \"I'll never shoot another bird except hawks after chickens, and I won't  brag about this one. It was so tame, and trusted me, I was very mean to  kill it.\"    As he thought this, Tommy smoothed the ruffled feathers of the dead  thrush, and, making a little grave under the pine, buried it wrapped in  green leaves, and left it there where its mate could sing over it, and  no rude hands disturb its rest.    \"I'll tell mamma and she will understand: but I _won't_ tell Billy. He  is such a greedy old chap he'll say I ought to have kept the poor bird  to eat,\" thought Tommy, as he went back to the hut, and sat there,  restringing his bow, till Billy woke up, much more amiable for his  sleep.    They tried to find the woodchuck, but lost their way, and wandered  deeper into the great forest till they came to a rocky place and could  go no farther. They climbed up and tumbled down, turned back and went  round, looked at the sun and knew it was late, chewed sassafras bark and  checkerberry leaves for supper, and grew more and more worried and tired  as hour after hour went by and they saw no end to woods and rocks. Once  or twice they heard the hunter's gun far away, and called and tried to  find him.    Tommy scolded Billy for not going with the man, who knew his way and was  probably safe in the valley when the last faint shot came up to them.  Billy cried, and reproached Tommy for proposing to run away; and both  felt very homesick for their mothers and their good safe beds at Farmer  Mullin's.    The sun set, and found them in a dreary place full of rocks and blasted  trees half-way up the mountain. They were so tired they could hardly  walk, and longed to lie down anywhere to sleep; but, remembering the  hunter's story of the bear, they were afraid to do it, till Tommy  suggested climbing a tree, after making a fire at the foot of it to  scare away the bear, lest he climb too and get them.    But, alas! the matches were left in their first camp; so they decided to  take turns to sleep and watch, since it was plain that they must spend  the night there. Billy went up first, and creeping into a good notch of  the bare tree tried to sleep, while brave Tommy, armed with a big stick,  marched to and fro below. Every few minutes a trembling voice would call  from above, \"Is anything coming?\" and an anxious voice would answer from  below, \"Not yet. Hurry up and go to sleep! I want my turn.\"    At last Billy began to snore, and then Tommy felt so lonely he couldn't  bear it; so he climbed to a lower branch, and sat nodding and trying  to keep watch, till he too fell fast asleep, and the early moon saw the  poor boys roosting there like two little owls.    A loud cry, a scrambling overhead, and then a great shaking and howling  waked Tommy so suddenly that he lost his wits for a moment and did not  know where he was.    \"The bear! the bear! don't let him get me! Tommy, Tommy, come and make  him let go,\" cried Billy, filling the quiet night with dismal howls.    Tommy looked up, expecting to behold a large bear eating his unhappy  friend; but the moonlight showed him nothing but poor Billy dangling  from a bough, high above the ground, caught by his belt when he fell. He  had been "]]]
