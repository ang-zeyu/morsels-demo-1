MOORED IN FUNCHAL ROAD, MADEIRA, Wednesday, 14th. First part fine, Clear  weather, remainder Cloudy, with Squals from the land, attended with  Showers of rain. In the Night the Bend of the Hawsers of the Stream  Anchor Slip'd owing to the Carelessness of the Person who made it fast.  In the Morning hove up the Anchor in the Boat and carried it out to the  Southward. In heaving the Anchor out of the Boat Mr. Weir, Master's Mate,  was carried overboard by the Buoy rope and to the Bottom with the Anchor.  Hove up the Anchor by the Ship as soon as possible, and found his Body  intangled in the Buoy rope. Moor'd the Ship with the two Bowers in 22  fathoms Water; the Loo Rock West and the Brazen Head East. Saild His  Majesty's Ship Rose. The Boats employed carrying the Casks a Shore for  Wine, and the Caulkers caulking the Ship Sides. Wind Easterly.    Thursday, 15th. Squals of Wind from the Land, with rain the most part of  these 24 Hours. Received on board fresh Beef and Greens for the Ship's  Company, and sent on shore all our Casks for Wine and Water, having a  Shore Boat employed for that purpose. Wind North-East to South-East.    Friday, 16th. The most part fine, Clear weather. Punished Henry Stevens,  Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with 12 lashes each, for refusing to  take their allowance of Fresh Beef. Employed taking on board Wine and  Water. Wind Easterly.    Saturday, 17th. Little wind, and fine Clear weather. Issued to the whole  Ship's Company 20 pounds of Onions per Man. Employed as Yesterday. Wind  Westerly.    Sunday, 18th. Ditto Weather. P.M. received on board 270 pounds of fresh  Beef, and a Live Bullock charged 613 pounds. Compleated our Wine and  Water, having received of the former 3032 Gallons, of the Latter 10 Tuns.  A.M. unmoor'd and prepar'd for Sailing. Funchall, in the Island of  Madeira, by Observations made here by Dr. Eberton, F.R.S., lies in the  latitude of 32 degrees 33 minutes 33 seconds North and longitude West  from Greenwich 16 degrees 49 minutes,* (* Modern determination is 32  degrees 38 minutes North, 16 degrees 54 minutes West.) the Variation of  the Compass 15 degrees 30 minutes West, decreasing as he says, which I  much doubt;* (* Cook was right: the variation was increasing.) neither  does this Variation agree with our own Observations. The Tides flow full,  and Change North and South, and rise Perpendicular 7 feet at Spring Tides  and 4 feet at Niep tides. We found the North point of the Diping Needle,  belonging to the Royal Society, to Dip 77 degrees 18 minutes. The  Refreshments for Shipping to be got at this place are Wine, Water, Fruit  of Several Sorts, and Onions in Plenty, and some Sweatmeats; but Fresh  Meat and Poultry are very Dear, and not to be had at any rate without  Leave from the Governour. Wind southerly, East-South-East, South-West.    [Sailed from Madeira.]    Monday, 19th. Light breezes and fine Clear weather. At Midnight Sailed  from Funchall. At 8 a.m. the high land over it bore North 1/2 East.  Unbent the Cables, stow'd the Anchors, and issued to the Ship's Company  10 pounds of Onions per Man. Ship's Draught of Water, Fore 14 feet 8  inches; Aft 15 feet 1 inch. Wind East-South-East; latitude 31 degrees 43  minutes North; at noon, High land over Funchall North 7 degrees East, 49  miles.    Tuesday, 20th. Light Airs and Clear weather. P.M. took several Azimuth,  which gave the Variation 16 degrees 30 minutes West. Put the Ship's  Company to three Watches. Wind variable; course South 21 degrees 30  minutes West; distance 28 miles; latitude 31 degrees 17 minutes,  longitude 17 degrees 19 minutes West; at noon, Funchall, Island of  Madeira, North 13 degrees East, 76 miles.    Wednesday, 21st. First part light Airs, remainder fresh Breezes and Clear  weather. Served Hooks and Lines to the Ship's Company, and employed them  in the day in making Matts, etc., for the Rigging. Wind South-West to  South-West by West; course South 60 degrees East; distance 60 miles;  latitude 30 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 16 degrees 8 minutes  South; at noon, Funchall North 10 degrees West, 113 miles.    Thursday, 22nd. Genteel breezes and Clear weather. At 4 p.m. saw the  Salvages bearing South; at 6, the Body of the Island bore South 1/2 West,  distant about 5 leagues. Found the Variation of the Compass by an Azimuth  to be 17 degrees 50 minutes West. At 10 the Isles of Salvages bore West  by South 1/2 South, distance 2 leagues. I make those Islands to be in  latitude 30 degrees 11 minutes South, and South 16 degrees East, 58  leagues from Funchall, Madeira. Wind South-West; course South 35 degrees  30 minutes East; distance 73 miles; latitude 29 degrees 40 minutes North,  longitude 15 degrees 31 minutes West; at noon, Funchall North 21 degrees  West, 62 leagues.    Friday, 23rd. Light breezes and Clear weather. At 6 a.m. saw the Peak of  Teneriff bearing West by South 1/2 South, and the Grand Canaries South  1/2 West. The Variation of the Compass from 17 degrees 22 minutes to 16  degrees 30 minutes, Wind South-West, North-East; course South 26 degrees  West; distance 54 miles; latitude 28 degrees 51 minutes North, longitude  15 degrees 50 minutes West; at noon, Funchal North 12 degrees 45 minutes  West, 77 leagues.    Saturday, 24th. A fresh Breeze and Clear weather the most part of these  24 Hours. I take this to be the North-East Trade we have now got into. At  6 p.m. the North-East end of the Island of Teneriff West by North,  distance 3 or 4 Leagues. Off this North-East point lies some Rocks high  above the water. The highest is near the point, and very remarkable. By  our run from Yesterday at Noon this end of the Island must lie in the  latitude of 28 degrees 27 minutes and South 7 degrees 45 minutes East,  distance 83 leagues from Funchal, and South 18 degrees West, 98 miles  from the Salvages. At 1 a.m. the Peak of Teneriff bore West-North-West.  Found the Variation to be this morning 16 degrees 14 minutes West. The  Peak of Teneriff (from which I now take my departure) is a very high  Mountain upon the Island of the same name--one of the Canary Islands. Its  perpendicular higth from Actual Measurement is said to be 15,396 feet.*  (* The received height is 12,180 feet. Latitude 28 degrees 16 minutes  North, Longitude 16 degrees 38 minutes West.) It lies in the Latitude of  28 degrees 13 minutes North, and Longitude 16 degrees 32 minutes from  Greenwich. Its situation in this respect is allowed to be pretty well  determined. Wind North-East by East; latitude 27 degrees 10 minutes  North; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 18 degrees 45 minutes, 74 miles.    Sunday, 25th. A Steady Trade Wind and Clear Weather. The Variation by the  Amplitude this Evening was 14 degrees 58 minutes West. Wind East by  North, East-North-East; course South 41 degrees West; distance 126 miles;  latitude 25 degrees 36 minutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 33  degrees 15 minutes East, 61 leagues.    Monday, 26th. Fresh breezes and somewhat Hazey. Variation by this Evening  Amplitude 15 degrees 1 minute West. Wind North-East by East; course South  22 degrees 15 minutes West; distance 122 miles; latitude 23 degrees 43  minutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 29 degrees East, 317 miles.    Tuesday, 27th. Ditto weather. Served Wine to the Ship's Company, the Beer  being all Expended but 2 Casks, which I intend to keep some time Longer,  as the whole has proved very good to the last Cask. At Noon found the  Ship by Observation 10 miles a Head of the Log, which I suppose may be  owing to a Current setting in the same direction of the Trade Wind. Wind  North-East; course South 19 degrees West; distance 145 miles; latitude 21  degrees 26 minutes North; at noon, Peak of Teneriff, North 26 degrees  East, 154 leagues.    Wednesday, 28th. A Fresh Trade wind and Hazey weather. The Variation of  the Compass by the mean of Several Azimuth taken this Evening 12 degrees  46 minutes, and in the Morning by the same Method 12 degrees 43 minutes  West. This day's Log and Observed Latitude agree, which is not  reconcilable to Yesterday. Exercised the People at Small Arms. Wind  North-East, East-North-East; course South 12 degrees 30 minutes West;  distance 150 miles; latitude 18 degrees 59 minutes North; at noon, Peak  of Teneriff North 23 degrees 15 minutes East, 204 leagues.    Thursday, 29th. Fresh breezes and Hazey weather. The Variation 12 degrees  33 minutes West; the Observed Latitude ahead of that given by the Log 10  miles. Wind North-East by North; course South 14 degrees West; distance  90 miles; latitude 17 degrees 32 minutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff,  North 33 degrees East, 236 leagues.    [Off Cape de Verd Islands.]    Friday, 30th. A Steady breeze and Pleasant weather. At 6 a.m. saw the  Island of Bonavista (one of the Cape de Verd islands), Extending from  South by East to South-West by South, distance 3 or 4 Leagues. Ranged the  East side of this Island at the Distance of 3 or 4 miles from the Shore,  until we were obliged to Haul Off to avoid a Ledge of Rocks which  stretched out South-West by West from the Body or South-East Point of the  Island 1 1/2 leagues. Had no ground with 40 fathoms a Mile without this  Ledge. The Island of Bonavista is in Extent from North to South about 5  leagues, is of a very uneven and hilly Surface, with low sandy beaches on  the East side. The South-East part of the Island, from which I take my  Departure, by an Observation this day at Noon lies in the latitude of 16  degrees North, and according to our run from Madeira in the longitude of  21 degrees 51 minutes West from Greenwich, and South 21 degrees West; 260  leagues from Tenerriff. Drawings Numbers 1 and 2 represent the appearance  of the East side of this Island, where (2) is the South-East point, with  the hill over it, which is high, of a round Figure, and the southermost  on the Island.

He thought it also to be against  conscience, that he that without an othe had borowed, should not nowe for  his own, be beleued with an othe. The forfect for non paiment of the lone,  mought not bee aboue the double of the somme that was borowed. And paiement  was made onely of the goodes of the borower, the body was not arrestable.  For the Lawemaker thought it conueniente, that onely the gooddes should bee  subdite to the debte, and the bodies (whose seruice was required bothe in  peace and in warre) subiecte to the citie. It was not thoughte to bee  Iustice, that the manne of warre, whiche hasardeth his bodie for the  sauftie of his countrie, should for an enterest of lone, bee throwen into  prisone. The whiche lawe, Solon siemeth to haue translated to the  Athenienses, vndre the name of the lawe Sisarea, decreyng that the body of  no citezein, should for any maner of enterest be emprisoned.    [Footnote: It may interest readers to see how much the knowledge of Africa  had extended in 150 years. Cluverius, in his \"Introductio in Geographiam.\"  1659, says:--    _Summa Africa descriptio_.    Asiæ exiguo Isthmo annectitur maxima Orbis terrarum peninsula Africa, tria  millia et triginta circiter mill German. ambitu complectens. Isthmi  intercapedo est mill. xxv. Pleraque Africæ inculta, et aut arenis  sterilibus obducta, aut ob sitim coeli terrarumque deserta sunt, aut  infestantur multo ac malefico genere animalium; in universum vasta est  magis quam frequens. Quædam tamen partes eximie fertiles. Græcis Libya  dicitur, à Libya Epaphi filii Iovis filia: Africam autem ab Afro Libys  Herculis filio dictam volunt. Maria eam cingunt, qua Sol oritur Rubrum, qua  medius dies Æthiopicum, qua occidit Sol Atlanticum; ab Septemtrionibus  Internum, Africum seu Libycum dictum, qua eam alluit. Longitudo summa  computatur ab Herculis freto ad promontorium Bonæ Spei mill. DCC. Latitudo  inter duo promontoria, Hesperium, vulgo _C. Verde_, et Aromata, quod est  juxta fauces Arabici sinus, vulgo nunc _Coarda fui_, mill. DL. Terra ipsa,  nisi qua interno mari accedit, obscure veteribus nota. Vltra autem Nili  fontes ac montes Lunæ prorsus incognita.    Regiones atque gentes in quas divisa fuit quondam, sunt, Ægyptus,  Cyrenaïca, Africa Minor, seu proprie dicta, Troglodytæ, Garamantes,  Numidia, Mauritania, Gaetulia, Libya interior, Arabia Troglodytica et  Æthiopia.      CAP. II.    _Ægyptus_.    Prima Africæ Asiæque proxima est Ægyptus, quam veteres Geographi in Asiæ  regionibus computarunt. At posteriores, Arabico sinu, vt ante dictum, inter  Asiam Africamque termino constituto, Africæ eam contribuerunt.    Nomen traxit ab Ægypto Danai fratre; ante Aëria dicta. Terminatur à  Septemtrione suo mari, id est, Ægyptio, ab Ortu Arabia Petræa et dicto  sinu; a Meridie Æthiopia, ab Occasu Cyrenaïca. Longa est a Pelusíaco Nilí  ostio ad Catabathmum opidum milliar.

Superiorem rursus Nilus dividebat in Libycam,  qua Occidentem, et Arabicam, qua Orientem spectat. Hinc populi Arabægyptii,  illinc Libyægyptii, dicti. Inferioris pars est Marcotis, sive Marmarica,  vltima versus Occidentem Cyrenaïcæ contermina. Speciatim vero universa  Ægyptus in complures præfecturas descripta erat, quas Græco vocabulo Nomos  vocarunt.    _De urbibus Ægypti_.    Ægyptus super ceteram antiquitatis gloriam, viginti millia urbium sibi  Amase regnante habitata quondam prætulit; postea quoque sub Romano imperio  multis, etiamsi ignobilibus, frequens.    Clarissima omnium fuit Alexandria, caput Ægypti totiusque Africæ, post  deletam Carthaginem prima; ab Alexandro Magno condita; postea in tantam  aucta multitudinem atque frequentiam, uti uni tantum Romæ cederet. Secunda  ab hac Diospolis, sive Thebae cognomine Ægyptiæ; quas centum portas  habuisse ferunt; sive, at alii ajunt, centum aulas, totidem olim Principum  domos; solitasque singulas, ubi negotium exegerat, ducenos armatos milites  effundere. Deinde Memphis, regia quondam: juxta quam pyramides, regum  sepulchra. Turres sunt fastigiatæ, ultra celsitudinem omnnem, quæ fieri  manu possit; itaque mensuram umbrarum egressæ, nullas habent umbras, regum  pecuniæ otiosa ac stulta ostentatio. Reliquæ urbes sunt, Syene, Sais,  Bubastis, Elephantis, Tentyris, Arsinoe et Abydus, Memnonis olim regia;  postea Osiris fano inclyta: et Arabiæ contermina, claritatis magnæ  Heliopolis, id est, Solis urbs. In Marmarica vicus fuit Apis, nobilis  religione Ægypti locus. Fuit et Labyrinthus nullo addito ligno  exædificatus, domos mille et regias duodecim perpetuo parietis ambitu  amplexus, marmore exstructus et tectus, unum in se descensum habens, intus  pene innumerabiles vias, multis ambagibus huc et illuc remeantibus.      CAP. III.    _De incolis Ægypti ac Nilo flumine; item de Libya exteriore_.    Ipsi Ægyptii, hominum vetustissimos se prædicantes, cum Scythis de gentis  antiquitate olim contenderunt. Antiquissimos esse post Syros, vel ipsa  sacra Scriptura attestatur. Disciplinarum complurium inventores rerumque  divinarum ac siderum peritissimi dicti sunt, quare ad eos Dædalus,  Melampus, Pythagoras, Homerus et alii complures eruditionis causa profecti.    Sub regibus esse jam inde ab initio rerum consueverunt, modo suis, modo  Æthiopibus; dein Persis ac Macedonibus; moxque iterum suis, donec Romani,  Augusto debellante, in provinciam redegerunt Ægyptum. Post hoc Saraceni eam  occuparunt: quibus successit Sultanorum inclytum nomen, ex Circassis  Tartarorum gente ortum. Postremi Turcæ ann. M DXVI invaserunt, qui etiam  nunc tenent.    _Nilus_.    Sed de Nilo hoc loco pauca quædam retulisse haud abs re fuerit. Terra ipsa  Ægyptus expers imbrium mire tamen fertilis, et hominum aliorumque  perfoecunda generatrix. Nilus id efficit, amnium in internum mare  permeantium maximus. Hic in Africæ desertis, montibus Lunæ ortus, haud  statim Nilus est, et primum ingentem lacum Nilidem, qui nunc _Zaire_ et  _Zembre_ dicitur, CXX. milliar. German. permeans, cum diu simplex sævusque  receptis dextera magnis aquis descendit, Astapus cognominatus, quod  Æthiopum lingua significat aquam è tenebris profluentem, circa Meroen,  Insularum, quas innumeras lateque patentes spargit, clarissimam, lævo alveo  Astabores dictus est, hoc est, ramus aquæ venientis è tenebris; dextero  veto Astusapes, quod latentis significationem adjicit, nec ante, quam ubi  rursum coit, Nilua dictus est. Inde partim asper, partimnavigia patiens;  mox præcipiti cursu progressus, inter occursantes scopulos non fluere  immenso fragore creditur, sed ruere. Postea lenis, et fractis aquis  domitaque violentia, et spatio fessus, tandem ad [Greek: Delta] opidum per  omnem Ægyptum vagus et dispersus, septem ingentibus ostiis in mare Ægytium  se evomit. Bis in anno, certis diebus auctu magno per totam spatiatus  Ægyptum, foecundus innatat terris. Causas hujus incrementi varias  prodidere; sed maxime probabiles duas: Etefiarum eo tempore ex adverso  flantium repercussum, ultro in ora acto mari: aut imbres Æthiopiæ æstivos,  iisdem Etesiis nubila illò ferentibus ex reliquo orbe. Idem amnis unus  omnium nullas expirat auras.    _Libya exterior_.    Cæterum à tergo Ægypti versus Meridiem, juxta sinistram Nili ripam, Libya  est exterior ad Æthiopiam extensa: nunc est _Elfocat_ desertum et _Gaoga_.      CAP. IV.    _Cyrenaïca, Africa Minor, Libyæ deserta, Troglodytæ et Garmantes_.    Ægypto annexa est Cyrenaïca regio, Ammonis oraculo maxime clara, nuunc  Barchanæ provinciæ dimidia pars Orientalis, eadem Pentapolitana dicta, à  quinque insignium urbium numero, quæ Berænice, Arsinoe, Ptolemais,  Apollonia, et ipsa Cyrene, unde regioni nomen. Græci hanc condiderunt, ex  Thera insula. Ægæi maris profecti. Ipsi Cyrenenses privata sorte inter  Ægyptios ac Poenos diu egerunt; dein cum Carthaginiensibus de agrorum  finibus magnum ac diuturnum bellum gesserunt. Mox Carthagine deleta, et  ipsi cum reliqua Africa Romano Imperio cesserunt. Posthinc solum eorum  Sultanis, tandem Turcis.    _Africa Minor_.    Sequitur Africa Minor sive proprie dicta. Terminatur à Septemtrione Africo  pelago, ab Ortu sinu magnæ Syrtis, à Meridie montium perpetuis jugis;  quibus à Libyæ desertis et Gætulis discernitur; ab Occasu Tusca amne.  Continet hodie Tunetanum regnum.    Fluvii in ea clari Cinyphus, Triton, Tritonidem paludem trahens: Catada, ad  Carthaginem se devolvens, et Bagradas omnium maximas ad Vticam, ac  Tuscaterminus Africæ Minoris.    Populorum varia nomina. Clarissimi Nasamones, extra Africam propriam etiam  Cyrenaïcæ et Marmaricæ contermini; quos antea Mesammones Græci  adpellaverunt, ab argumento loci, medios inter arenas sitos, et ab his  sublati Psylli, quorum corpori ingenitum fuit virus exitiale serpentibus,  ut cujus odore vel fugarent vel sopirent eas: et supra Carthaginem  Libyphoenices, iidem et Poeni à Phoenice Tyro profecti, Duce Eliza sive  Didone, quæ Carthaginem condidit.    Vrbium celeberrimæ Lepris magna, quæ et Neapolis, Abrotonum, Taphræ, Capsa,  Thysdrus, Thapsus, Leptis parva, Rhuspina, Adrumetum, Clupea, Turres,  Vthina et Carthago, Romæ æmula, terrarum cupida, opulentissima quondam  totius Africæ, antequam Romani tribus bellis devictam deleverunt. Vtica  Catonis, qui inde Vticensis, morte nobilis.    _Libya deserta, Troglodytæ et Garamantes_.    Ab Africæ minoris tergo versus Austrum Libyæ deserta fuerunt; ultraque  Troglodytæ, nunc _Berdoa_ desertum. Hos tegit ab Austro Ater mons, et trans  eum Garamantes populi clari, nunc _Borno_ regnum. Caput gentis fuit Garama,  quam hodieque eodem nomine exstare tradunt. Debris inclyta affuso fonte,  cujus aquæ ex coelesti quidem vertigine mutant qualitatem, at controversa  siderum disciplina; quidpe qui friget calore, calet frigore; à medio  scilicet die ad noctem mediam aquis ferventibus, totidemque horis ad medium  diem rigentíbus."]]]
