So they hurriedly ate some fruit--there were plenty  of plums and fijoas in this part of the orchard--and then they mounted  the animals and set out upon the journey to the strange city.  Hank the  Mule had breakfasted on grass, and the Lion had stolen away and found a  breakfast to his liking; he never told what it was, but Dorothy hoped  the little rabbits and the field mice had kept out of his way.  She  warned Toto not to chase birds and gave the dog some apple, with which  he was quite content.  The Woozy was as fond of fruit as of any other  food except honey, and the Sawhorse never ate at all.    Except for their worry over Ozma, they were all in good spirits as they  proceeded swiftly over the plain.  Toto still worried over his lost  growl, but like a wise little dog kept his worry to himself. Before  long, the city grew nearer and they could examine it with interest.    In outward appearance the place was more imposing than Thi, and it was  a square city, with a square, four-sided wall around it, and on each  side was a square gate of burnished copper.  Everything about the city  looked solid and substantial; there were no banners flying, and the  towers that rose above the city wall seemed bare of any ornament  whatever.    A path led from the fruit orchard directly to one of the city gates,  showing that the inhabitants preferred fruit to thistles.  Our friends  followed this path to the gate, which they found fast shut.  But the  Wizard advanced and pounded upon it with his fist, saying in a loud  voice, \"Open!\"    At once there rose above the great wall a row of immense heads, all of  which looked down at them as if to see who was intruding.  The size of  these heads was astonishing, and our friends at once realized that they  belonged to giants who were standing within the city.  All had thick,  bushy hair and whiskers, on some the hair being white and on others  black or red or yellow, while the hair of a few was just turning gray,  showing that the giants were of all ages.  However fierce the heads  might seem, the eyes were mild in expression, as if the creatures had  been long subdued, and their faces expressed patience rather than  ferocity.    \"What's wanted?\" asked one old giant in a low, grumbling voice.    \"We are strangers, and we wish to enter the city,\" replied the Wizard.    \"Do you come in war or peace?\" asked another.    \"In peace, of course,\" retorted the Wizard, and he added impatiently,  \"Do we look like an army of conquest?\"    \"No,\" said the first giant who had spoken, \"you look like innocent  tramps; but you never can tell by appearances.  Wait here until we  report to our masters.  No one can enter here without the permission of  Vig, the Czarover.\"    \"Who's that?\" inquired Dorothy.    But the heads had all bobbed down and disappeared behind the walls, so  there was no answer.  They waited a long time before the gate rolled  back with a rumbling sound, and a loud voice cried, \"Enter!\"  But they  lost no time in taking advantage of the invitation.    On either side of the broad street that led into the city from the gate  stood a row of huge giants, twenty of them on a side and all standing  so close together that their elbows touched.  They wore uniforms of  blue and yellow and were armed with clubs as big around as treetrunks.  Each giant had around his neck a broad band of gold, riveted on, to  show he was a slave.    As our friends entered riding upon the Lion, the Woozy, the Sawhorse  and the Mule, the giants half turned and walked in two files on either  side of them, as if escorting them on their way.  It looked to Dorothy  as if all her party had been made prisoners, for even mounted on their  animals their heads scarcely reached to the knees of the marching  giants.  The girls and Button-Bright were anxious to know what sort of  a city they had entered, and what the people were like who had made  these powerful creatures their slaves.  Through the legs of the giants  as they walked, Dorothy could see rows of houses on each side of the  street and throngs of people standing on the sidewalks, but the people  were of ordinary size and the only remarkable thing about them was the  fact that they were dreadfully lean and thin.  Between their skin and  their bones there seemed to be little or no flesh, and they were mostly  stoop-shouldered and weary looking, even to the little children.    More and more, Dorothy wondered how and why the great giants had ever  submitted to become slaves of such skinny, languid masters, but there  was no chance to question anyone until they arrived at a big palace  located in the heart of the city.  Here the giants formed lines to the  entrance and stood still while our friends rode into the courtyard of  the palace.  Then the gates closed behind them, and before them was a  skinny little man who bowed low and said in a sad voice, \"If you will  be so obliging as to dismount, it will give me pleasure to lead you  into the presence of the World's Most Mighty Ruler, Vig the Czarover.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" said Dorothy indignantly.    \"What don't you believe?\" asked the man.    \"I don't believe your Czarover can hold a candle to our Ozma.\"    \"He wouldn't hold a candle under any circumstances, or to any living  person,\" replied the man very seriously, \"for he has slaves to do such  things and the Mighty Vig is too dignified to do anything that others  can do for him.  He even obliges a slave to sneeze for him, if ever he  catches cold.  However, if you dare to face our powerful ruler, follow  me.\"    \"We dare anything,\" said the Wizard, \"so go ahead.\"    Through several marble corridors having lofty ceilings they passed,  finding each corridor and doorway guarded by servants.  But these  servants of the palace were of the people and not giants, and they were  so thin that they almost resembled skeletons.  Finally, they entered a  great circular room with a high, domed ceiling, where the Czarover sat  on a throne cut from a solid block of white marble and decorated with  purple silk hangings and gold tassels.    The ruler of these people was combing his eyebrows when our friends  entered the throne room and stood before him, but he put the comb in  his pocket and examined the strangers with evident curiosity.  Then he  said, \"Dear me, what a surprise!  You have really shocked me.  For no  outsider has ever before come to our City of Herku, and I cannot  imagine why you have ventured to do so.\"    \"We are looking for Ozma, the Supreme Ruler of the Land of Oz,\" replied  the Wizard.    \"Do you see her anywhere around here?\" asked the Czarover.    \"Not yet, Your Majesty, but perhaps you may tell us where she is.\"    \"No, I have my hands full keeping track of my own people.  I find them  hard to manage because they are so tremendously strong.\"    \"They don't look very strong,\" said Dorothy. \"It seems as if a good  wind would blow 'em way out of the city if it wasn't for the wall.\"    \"Just so, just so,\" admitted the Czarover.  \"They really look that way,  don't they?  But you must never trust to appearances, which have a way  of fooling one.  Perhaps you noticed that I prevented you from meeting  any of my people.  I protected you with my giants while you were on the  way from the gates to my palace so that not a Herku got near you.\"    \"Are your people so dangerous, then?\" asked the Wizard.    \"To strangers, yes.  But only because they are so friendly.  For if  they shake hands with you, they are likely to break your arms or crush  your fingers to a jelly.\"    \"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Because we are the strongest people in all the world.\"    \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the boy.  \"That's bragging.  You prob'ly don't know  how strong other people are.  Why, once I knew a man in Philadelphi'  who could bend iron bars with just his hands!\"    \"But mercy me, it's no trick to bend iron bars,\" said His Majesty.  \"Tell me, could this man crush a block of stone with his bare hands?\"    \"No one could do that,\" declared the boy.    \"If I had a block of stone, I'd show you,\" said the Czarover, looking  around the room.  \"Ah, here is my throne.  The back is too high,  anyhow, so I'll just break off a piece of that.\"  He rose to his feet  and tottered in an uncertain way around the throne.  Then he took hold  of the back and broke off a piece of marble over a foot thick. \"This,\"  said he, coming back to his seat, \"is very solid marble and much harder  than ordinary stone.  Yet I can crumble it easily with my fingers, a  proof that I am very strong.\"    Even as he spoke, he began breaking off chunks of marble and crumbling  them as one would a bit of earth.  The Wizard was so astonished that he  took a piece in his own hands and tested it, finding it very hard  indeed.    Just then one of the giant servants entered and exclaimed, \"Oh, Your  Majesty, the cook has burned the soup!  What shall we do?\"    \"How dare you interrupt me?\" asked the Czarover, and grasping the  immense giant by one of his legs, he raised him in the air and threw  him headfirst out of an open window.  \"Now, tell me,\" he said, turning  to Button-Bright, \"could your man in Philadelphia crumble marble in his  fingers?\"    \"I guess not,\" said Button-Bright, much impressed by the skinny  monarch's strength.    \"What makes you so strong?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"It's the zosozo,\" he explained, \"which is an invention of my own.  I  and all my people eat zosozo, and it gives us tremendous strength.  Would you like to eat some?\"    \"No thank you,\" replied the girl.  \"I--I don't want to get so thin.\"    \"Well, of course one can't have strength and flesh at the same time,\"  said the Czarover.  \"Zosozo is pure energy, and it's the only compound  of its sort in existence.  I never allow our giants to have it, you  know, or they would soon become our masters, since they are bigger that  we; so I keep all the stuff locked up in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#14)"],[1," were as  happy and contented as can be.    Another strange thing about this fairy Land of Oz was that whoever  managed to enter it from the outside world came under the magic spell  of the place and did not change in appearance as long as they lived  there. So Dorothy, who now lived with Ozma, seemed just the same sweet  little girl she had been when first she came to this delightful  fairyland.    Perhaps all parts of Oz might not be called truly delightful, but it  was surely delightful in the neighborhood of the Emerald City, where  Ozma reigned. Her loving influence was felt for many miles around, but  there were places in the mountains of the Gillikin Country, and the  forests of the Quadling Country, and perhaps in far-away parts of the  Munchkin and Winkie Countries, where the inhabitants were somewhat rude  and uncivilized and had not yet come under the spell of Ozma's wise and  kindly rule. Also, when Oz first became a fairyland, it harbored  several witches and magicians and sorcerers and necromancers, who were  scattered in various parts, but most of these had been deprived of  their magic powers, and Ozma had issued a royal edict forbidding anyone  in her dominions to work magic except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of  Oz. Ozma herself, being a real fairy, knew a lot of magic, but she only  used it to benefit her subjects.    This little explanation will help you to understand better the story  you are reaching, but most of it is already known to those who are  familiar with the Oz people whose adventures they have followed in  other Oz books.    Ozma and Dorothy were fast friends and were much together. Everyone in  Oz loved Dorothy almost as well as they did their lovely Ruler, for the  little Kansas girl's good fortune had not spoiled her or rendered her  at all vain. She was just the same brave and true and adventurous child  as before she lived in a royal palace and became the chum of the fairy  Ozma.    In the room in which the two sat--which was one of Ozma's private suite  of apartments--hung the famous Magic Picture. This was the source of  constant interest to little Dorothy. One had but to stand before it and  wish to see what any person was doing, and at once a scene would flash  upon the magic canvas which showed exactly where that person was, and  like our own moving pictures would reproduce the actions of that person  as long as you cared to watch them. So today, when Dorothy tired of her  embroidery, she drew the curtains from before the Magic Picture and  wished to see what her friend Button Bright was doing. Button Bright,  she saw, was playing ball with Ojo, the Munchkin boy, so Dorothy next  wished to see what her Aunt Em was doing. The picture showed Aunt Em  quietly engaged in darning socks for Uncle Henry, so Dorothy wished to  see what her old friend the Tin Woodman was doing.    The Tin Woodman was then just leaving his tin castle in the company of  the Scarecrow and Woot the Wanderer. Dorothy had never seen this boy  before, so she wondered who he was. Also she was curious to know where  the three were going, for she noticed Woot's knapsack and guessed they  had started on a long journey. She asked Ozma about it, but Ozma did  not know.    That afternoon Dorothy again saw the travelers in the Magic Picture,  but they were merely tramping through the country and Dorothy was not  much interested in them. A couple of days later, however, the girl,  being again with Ozma, wished to see her friends, the Scarecrow and the  Tin Woodman in the Magic Picture, and on this occasion found them in  the great castle of Mrs. Yoop, the Giantess, who was at the time about  to transform them. Both Dorothy and Ozma now became greatly interested  and watched the transformations with indignation and horror.    \"What a wicked Giantess!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"Yes,\" answered Ozma, \"she must be punished for this cruelty to our  friends, and to the poor boy who is with them.\"    After this they followed the adventure of the little Brown Bear and the  Tin Owl and the Green Monkey with breathless interest, and were  delighted when they escaped from Mrs. Yoop. They did not know, then,  who the Canary was, but realized it must be the transformation of some  person of consequence, whom the Giantess had also enchanted.    When, finally, the day came when the adventurers headed south into the  Munchkin Country, Dorothy asked anxiously:    \"Can't something be done for them, Ozma? Can't you change 'em back into  their own shapes? They've suffered enough from these dreadful  transformations, seems to me.\"    \"I've been studying ways to help them, ever since they were  transformed,\" replied Ozma. \"Mrs. Yoop is now the only yookoohoo in my  dominions, and the yookoohoo magic is very peculiar and hard for others  to understand, yet I am resolved to make the attempt to break these  enchantments. I may not succeed, but I shall do the best I can. From  the directions our friends are taking, I believe they are going to pass  by Jinjur's Ranch, so if we start now we may meet them there. Would you  like to go with me, Dorothy?\"    \"Of course,\" answered the little girl; \"I wouldn't miss it for  anything.\"    \"Then order the Red Wagon,\" said Ozma of Oz, \"and we will start at  once.\"    Dorothy ran to do as she was bid, while Ozma went to her Magic Room to  make ready the things she believed she would need. In half an hour the  Red Wagon stood before the grand entrance of the palace, and before it  was hitched the Wooden Sawhorse, which was Ozma's favorite steed.    This Sawhorse, while made of wood, was very much alive and could travel  swiftly and without tiring. To keep the ends of his wooden legs from  wearing down short, Ozma had shod the Sawhorse with plates of pure  gold. His harness was studded with brilliant emeralds and other jewels  and so, while he himself was not at all handsome, his outfit made a  splendid appearance.    Since the Sawhorse could understand her spoken words, Ozma used no  reins to guide him. She merely told him where to go. When she came from  the palace with Dorothy, they both climbed into the Red Wagon and then  the little dog, Toto, ran up and asked:    \"Are you going to leave me behind, Dorothy?\" Dorothy looked at Ozma,  who smiled in return and said:    \"Toto may go with us, if you wish him to.\"    So Dorothy lifted the little dog into the wagon, for, while he could  run fast, he could not keep up with the speed of the wonderful Sawhorse.      Away they went, over hills and through meadows, covering the ground  with astonishing speed. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Red  Wagon arrived before Jinjur's house just as that energetic young lady  had finished scrubbing the Green Monkey and was about to lead him to  the caramel patch.          Chapter Thirteen    The Restoration      The Tin Owl gave a hoot of delight when he saw the Red Wagon draw up  before Jinjur's house, and the Brown Bear grunted and growled with glee  and trotted toward Ozma as fast as he could wobble. As for the Canary,  it flew swiftly to Dorothy's shoulder and perched there, saying in her  ear:    \"Thank goodness you have come to our rescue!\"    \"But who are you?\" asked Dorothy    \"Don't you know?\" returned the Canary.    \"No; for the first time we noticed you in the Magic Picture, you were  just a bird, as you are now. But we've guessed that the giant woman had  transformed you, as she did the others.\"    \"Yes; I'm Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter,\" announced the Canary.    \"Goodness me!\" cried Dorothy. \"How dreadful.\"    \"Well, I make a rather pretty bird, I think,\" returned Polychrome, \"but  of course I'm anxious to resume my own shape and get back upon my  rainbow.\"    \"Ozma will help you, I'm sure,\" said Dorothy. \"How does it feel,  Scarecrow, to be a Bear?\" she asked, addressing her old friend.    \"I don't like it,\" declared the Scarecrow Bear. \"This brutal form is  quite beneath the dignity of a wholesome straw man.\"    \"And think of me,\" said the Owl, perching upon the dashboard of the Red  Wagon with much noisy clattering of his tin feathers. \"Don't I look  horrid, Dorothy, with eyes several sizes too big for my body, and so  weak that I ought to wear spectacles?\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy critically, as she looked him over, \"you're  nothing to brag of, I must confess. But Ozma will soon fix you up  again.\"    The Green Monkey had hung back, bashful at meeting two lovely girls  while in the form of a beast; but Jinjur now took his hand and led him  forward while she introduced him to Ozma, and Woot managed to make a  low bow, not really ungraceful, before her girlish Majesty, the Ruler  of Oz.    \"You have all been forced to endure a sad experience,\" said Ozma, \"and  so I am anxious to do all in my power to break Mrs. Yoop's  enchantments. But first tell me how you happened to stray into that  lonely Valley where Yoop Castle stands.\"    Between them they related the object of their journey, the Scarecrow  Bear telling of the Tin Woodman's resolve to find Nimmie Amee and marry  her, as a just reward for her loyalty to him. Woot told of their  adventures with the Loons of Loonville, and the Tin Owl described the  manner in which they had been captured and transformed by the Giantess.  Then Polychrome related her story, and when all had been told, and  Dorothy had several times reproved Toto for growling at the Tin Owl,  Ozma remained thoughtful for a while, pondering upon what she had  heard. Finally she looked up, and with one of her delightful smiles,  said to the anxious group:    \"I am not sure my magic will be able to restore every one of you,  because your transformations are of such a strange and unusual  character. Indeed, Mrs. Yoop was quite justified in believing no power  could alter her enchantments. However, I am sure I can restore the  Scarecrow to his original shape. He was stuffed with straw from the  beginning, and even the yookoohoo magic could not alter that. The  Giantess was "]]]
