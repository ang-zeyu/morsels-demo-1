THE TALE OF  SQUIRREL NUTKIN    BY  BEATRIX POTTER    _Author of_  \"_The Tale of Peter Rabbit_\"    [Illustration]    FREDERICK WARNE    [Illustration]    FREDERICK WARNE          1903 by Frederick Warne & Co.    Printed and bound in Great Britain by  William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London          A STORY FOR NORAH    [Illustration]    This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red  squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.    He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived  in a wood at the edge of a lake.    [Illustration]    In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut  bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the  house of an owl who is called Old Brown.    [Illustration]    One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes  were golden and green--Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little  squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    [Illustration]    They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water  to Owl Island to gather nuts.    Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail  for a sail.    [Illustration]    They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for  Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.    Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and  said politely--    \"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon  your island?\"    [Illustration]    But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and  down like a little red _cherry_, singing--        \"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!       A little wee man, in a red red coat!       A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;       If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.\"    Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention  whatever to Nutkin.    He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    [Illustration]    The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in  the evening.    [Illustration]    But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry  and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front  of Old Brown's doorway, and said--    \"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather  some more nuts?\"    [Illustration]    But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old  Mr. Brown with a _nettle_ and singing--        \"Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!       Hitty Pitty within the wall,       Hitty Pitty without the wall;       If you touch Hitty Pitty,       Hitty Pitty will bite you!\"    Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    [Illustration]    He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue  _smoke_ from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin  peeped through the key-hole and sang--        \"A house full, a hole full!       And you cannot gather a bowl-full!\"        [Illustration]    The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their  little sacks.    But Nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a  beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.    [Illustration]    On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they  caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.    They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl  Island.    [Illustration]    Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but  Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in  front, singing--        \"The man in the wilderness said to me,      'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'       I answered him as I thought good--       'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'\"    But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer  was provided for him.    [Illustration]    On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles,  which were as good as plums in _plum-pudding_ for Old Brown. Each beetle  was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.    But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--         \"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree        Flour of England, fruit of Spain,        Met together in a shower of rain;        Put in a bag tied round with a string,      If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!\"      Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to  Old Brown.    [Illustration]    The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin  gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of  pine-needle pins.    [Illustration]    On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so  sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon  the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble _bees'_ nest on the tippitty  top of the hill.    But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--        \"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!        As I went over Tipple-tine        I met a flock of bonny swine;      Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!        They were the very bonniest swine        That e'er went over Tipple-tine.\"    [Illustration]    Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.    But he ate up the honey!    [Illustration]    The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.    But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple  and green fir-cones.    [Illustration]    On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the  last time; they brought a new-laid _egg_ in a little rush basket as a last  parting present for Old Brown.    But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--        \"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,       With a white counterpane round his neck,       Forty doctors and forty wrights,       Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!\"    [Illustration]    Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it  again. But still he did not speak.    [Illustration]    Nutkin became more and more impertinent--          \"Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!      Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;      All the King's horses, and all the King's men,      Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,      Off the King's kitchen door.\"    Nutkin danced up and down like a _sunbeam_; but still Old Brown said  nothing at all.    [Illustration]    Nutkin began again--        \"Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,       He comes roaring up the land!       The King of Scots with all his power,       Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!\"    Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the _wind_, and he took a  running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!...    Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud  \"Squeak!\"    The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    [Illustration]    When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was Old  Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if  nothing had happened.           *       *       *       *       *    _But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!_    [Illustration]    This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    [Illustration]    Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail,  intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke  in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic  window.    [Illustration]    And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he  will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--    \"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!\"      THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14877"],[0,"The Tale of Ginger and Pickles"],[1,"THE TALE OF GINGER AND PICKLES          DEDICATED    WITH VERY KIND REGARDS TO OLD MR. JOHN TAYLOR,    WHO \"THINKS HE MIGHT PASS AS A DORMOUSE!\" (  THREE YEARS IN BED AND NEVER A GRUMBLE!)    [Illustration]    THE TALE OF GINGER & PICKLES    BY BEATRIX POTTER    _Author of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\" &c._    [Illustration]    FREDERICK WARNE            1909 by Frederick Warne & Co.    Printed and bound in Great Britain by  William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London          [Illustration]    Once upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was  \"Ginger and Pickles.\"    It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and Jane  Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.    The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and  Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.    They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.    In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly  everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces,  hair-pins and mutton chops.    Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow  tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.    The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of  Ginger.    Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made  his mouth water.    \"I cannot bear,\" said he, \"to see them going out at the door carrying  their little parcels.\"    \"I have the same feeling about rats,\" replied Pickles, \"but it would  never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha  Twitchit's.\"    \"On the contrary, they would go nowhere,\" replied Ginger gloomily.    (Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not  give credit.)    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.    Now the meaning of \"credit\" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap,  instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says  she will pay another time.    And Pickles makes a low bow and says, \"With pleasure, madam,\" and it is  written down in a book.    The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being  afraid of Ginger and Pickles.    But there is no money in what is called the \"till.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially  the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for  as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.    But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.    [Illustration]    As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat  their own goods.    Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.    They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.    [Illustration]    When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable  to buy a dog licence.    \"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,\" said Pickles.    \"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence,  and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\"    \"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried  in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;\" said Pickles.  \"The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\"    \"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9  for bacon.\"    \"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,\" replied Ginger.    [Illustration]    \"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream  crackers?\"    \"You have eaten them yourself,\" replied Ginger.    [Illustration]    Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.    They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.    \"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an  ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\"    \"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and  four matches?\"    \"Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with comp'ts,'\" replied Ginger.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been  pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an  envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!    Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.    \"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!\" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel,  \"he's only a German doll!\"    The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in  his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.    Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice.  He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.    [Illustration]    At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.  The policeman had disappeared.    But the envelope remained.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid  it is a summons,\" said Pickles.    \"No,\" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, \"it is the rates and  taxes, L3 19 11-3/4.\"    \"This is the last straw,\" said Pickles, \"let us close the shop.\"    They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the  neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.    [Illustration]    Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues;  he looks stout and comfortable.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.    [Illustration]    The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit  immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued  to refuse to give credit.    Of course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fish-man and  Timothy Baker.    But a person cannot live on \"seed wigs\" and sponge-cake and  butter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!    [Illustration]    After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints  and candles.    But they did not keep \"self-fitting sixes\"; and it takes five mice to  carry one seven inch candle.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm  weather.    [Illustration]    And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought  back to her with complaints.    And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would  say nothing but \"very snug;\" which is not the way to carry on a retail  business.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster  to say that she was going to re-open the shop--\"Henny's Opening Sale!  Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come  buy!\"    The poster really was most 'ticing.    [Illustration]    There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with  customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.    Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out  change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.    [Illustration]    And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.    There is something to please everybody."]]]
