THE TALE OF  TIMMY TIPTOES    [Illustration]    By  BEATRIX POTTER    Author of  \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\" etc.      [Illustration]    FREDERICK WARNE & CO., INC.  NEW YORK          1911  BY  FREDERICK WARNE & Co.      PRINTED IN THE U.S.A. BY  PRINCETON POLYCHROME PRESS      BINDING BY  A. HOROWITZ & SON          FOR    MANY UNKNOWN LITTLE FRIENDS,    INCLUDING MONICA      [Illustration]      Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called  Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall  tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.    [Illustration]    Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and  chuckled--\"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store  for winter and spring.\" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the  thatch--\"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.\" \"Then  we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in  spring-time,\" replied prudent Timothy.    [Illustration]    When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other  squirrels were there already.    Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly  by themselves.    [Illustration]    Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They  carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near  the tree where they had built their nest.    [Illustration]    When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high  up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled  down--down--down inside.    \"How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!\" said  Goody.    \"I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,\" said Timmy Tiptoes,  peeping into the hole.    [Illustration]    They did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! Squirrels who  bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot  remember the place.    The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to  dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts  that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels  began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!    [Illustration]    Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from  bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were  several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.    The first one sang--\"Who's bin digging-up _my_ nuts? Who's-been-digging-up  _my_ nuts?\"    And another sang--\"Little bita bread and-_no_-cheese! Little bit-a-bread  an'-_no_-cheese!\"    [Illustration]    The squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the  bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and  it sang--\"Who's-bin digging-up _my_ nuts? Who's been digging-up  _my_-nuts?\"    Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little  bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and  it meant nothing at all.    [Illustration]    But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy  Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The  innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a  fright!    Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his  nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--\"Who's-been digging-up  _my_-nuts?\"    [Illustration]    They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the  little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for  Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they  did not break his ribs. \"We will leave him here till he confesses,\" said  Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--    \"Who's-been-digging-up _my_-nuts?\"    [Illustration]    Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon  half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.    [Illustration]    Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea  for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.    Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured  back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels  drove her away.    She wandered all over the wood, calling--    \"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\"    [Illustration]    In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked  up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to  be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.  There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a  night light, and hoped he felt better?    It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its night-cap; and the  house was full of provisions.    [Illustration]    The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the  tree--\"Besides, I found a few buried!\" It laughed and chuckled when it  heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat  quantities--\"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin  myself? My wife will be anxious!\" \"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me  crack them for you,\" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and  fatter!    [Illustration]    Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any  more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how  they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled  down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a  decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little  striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.      [Illustration]    \"It is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full,  and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has  run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?\"    \"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,\"  said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; \"but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy  Tiptoes, has run away too.\" \"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told  me,\" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.    [Illustration]    She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.    Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and  a thin squirrel voice were singing together--        \"My little old man and I fell out,       How shall we bring this matter about?       Bring it about as well as you can,       And get you gone, you little old man!\"    [Illustration]    \"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,\" said Goody  Tiptoes. \"Yes, I could,\" said the Chipmunk, \"but my husband, Chippy  Hackee, bites!\"    Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the  fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--        \"For the diddlum day       Day diddle dum di!       Day diddle diddle dum day!\"    [Illustration]    Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--\"Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie,  Timmy Tiptoes!\" And Timmy replied, \"Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why,  certainly!\"    He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he  could not get out.    Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down  below and chuckled.    [Illustration]    And so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the  tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.    Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.    [Illustration]    But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was  uncomfortable.    [Illustration]    At last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was  looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.    [Illustration]    Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!    [Illustration]    And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his  head; and he was more uncomfortable still.    [Illustration]    And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a  little padlock.    [Illustration]    And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he  sings--\"Who's-been-digging-up _my_-nuts? Who's been digging-up _my_-nuts?\"  But nobody ever answers!

New York    1908                [Illustration]        [Illustration]            A FARMYARD TALE      FOR      RALPH AND BETSY        [Illustration]    What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!    --Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the  farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    [Illustration]    Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to  leave the hatching to some one else--\"I have not the patience to sit on a  nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let  them go cold; you know you would!\"    \"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,\" quacked  Jemima Puddle-duck.    [Illustration]    She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.    Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest  right away from the farm.    [Illustration]    She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over  the hill.    She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    [Illustration]    When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.    She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    [Illustration]    Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a  few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    [Illustration]    She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.    She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the  middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    [Illustration]    Jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a  convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some  tall fox-gloves.    But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed  gentleman reading a newspaper.    He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.    \"Quack?\" said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one  side--\"Quack?\"    [Illustration]    The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at  Jemima--    \"Madam, have you lost your way?\" said he. He had a long bushy tail which  he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.    Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had  not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry  nesting-place.    [Illustration]    \"Ah! is that so? indeed!\" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking  curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his  coat-tail pocket.    Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.    \"Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would  teach it to mind its own business!\"    [Illustration]    \"But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in  my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit  there as long as you like,\" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the  fox-gloves.    It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on  top of another, by way of a chimney.    [Illustration]    \"This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter  house--so convenient,\" said the hospitable gentleman.    There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old  soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in.    [Illustration]    The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but  it was comfortable and very soft.    Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of  feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any  trouble at all.    [Illustration]    When she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log  reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking  over the top of it.    He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for  the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back  again next day.    He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine  nestful in his wood-shed.    [Illustration]    Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.  They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them  immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not  there.    At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--\"and I  will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until  the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,\" said the conscientious  Jemima.    [Illustration]    \"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.  But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a  treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!    \"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a  savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some  parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette,\" said  the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    [Illustration]    Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and  onions made her suspicious.    She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different  sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    [Illustration]    And she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.    The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, \"What are you doing with those  onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?\"    Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.    The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she  described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    [Illustration]    He asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of  the house and shed.    Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two  fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    [Illustration]    Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny  afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in  a bag.    She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy  long-tailed gentleman.    [Illustration]    He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily  round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.    \"Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the  herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!\"    He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like  that.    She felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    [Illustration]    While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.  Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then  locked it.    Jemima became much alarmed.    [Illustration]    A moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls  and howls, squealing and groans.    And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.    Presently Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck.    [Illustration]    Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he  could stop them.    He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    [Illustration]    Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    [Illustration]    She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself:  but only four of them hatched.    Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had  always been a bad sitter."]]]
