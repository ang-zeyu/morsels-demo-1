But he that condemns him is guilty of perjury if he  sentences him to pay twenty minae while he believes the damages ought  not to be so much.    Now with respect to these honours which he proposes to bestow on those  who can give any information useful to the community, this, though very  pleasing in speculation, is what the legislator should not settle, for  it would encourage informers, and probably occasion commotions in the  state. And this proposal of his gives rise also to further conjectures  and inquiries; for some persons have doubted whether it is useful or  hurtful to alter the established law of any country, if even for the  better; for which reason one cannot immediately determine upon what he  here says, whether it is advantageous to alter the law or not. We know,  indeed, that it is possible to propose to new model both the laws and  government as a common good; and since we have mentioned this subject,  it may be very proper to enter into a few particulars concerning it, for  it contains some difficulties, as I have already said, and it may appear  better to alter them, since it has been found useful in other sciences.    Thus the science of physic is extended beyond its ancient bounds; so is  the gymnastic, and indeed all other arts and powers; so that one may lay  it down for certain that the same thing will necessarily hold good in  the art of government. And it may also be affirmed, that experience  itself gives a proof of this; for the ancient laws are too simple and  barbarous; which allowed the Greeks to wear swords in the city, and to  buy their wives of each [1269a]. other. And indeed all the remains of  old laws which we have are very simple; for instance, a law in Cuma  relative to murder. If any person who prosecutes another for murder can  produce a certain number of witnesses to it of his own relations, the  accused person shall be held guilty. Upon the whole, all persons ought  to endeavour to follow what is right, and not what is established; and  it is probable that the first men, whether they sprung out of the earth,  or were saved from some general calamity, had very little understanding  or knowledge, as is affirmed of these aborigines; so that it would be  absurd to continue in the practice of their rules. Nor is it, moreover,  right to permit written laws always to remain without alteration; for  as in all other sciences, so in politics, it is impossible to express  everything in writing with perfect exactness; for when we commit  anything to writing we must use general terms, but in every action there  is something particular to itself, which these may not comprehend; from  whence it is evident, that certain laws will at certain times admit of  alterations. But if we consider this matter in another point of view, it  will appear to require great caution; for when the advantage proposed is  trifling, as the accustoming the people easily to abolish their laws  is of bad consequence, it is evidently better to pass over some faults  which either the legislator or the magistrates may have committed; for  the alterations will not be of so much service as a habit of disobeying  the magistrates will be of disservice. Besides, the instance brought  from the arts is fallacious; for it is not the same thing to alter the  one as the other. For a law derives all its strength from custom, and  this requires long time to establish; so that, to make it an easy matter  to pass from the established laws to other new ones, is to weaken the  power of laws. Besides, here is another question; if the laws are to be  altered, are they all to be altered, and in every government or not, and  whether at the pleasure of one person or many? all which particulars  will make a great difference; for which reason we will at present drop  the inquiry, to pursue it at some other time.          CHAPTER IX      There are two considerations which offer themselves with respect to the  government established at Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in almost all  other states whatsoever; one is whether their laws do or do not promote  the best establishment possible? the other is whether there is anything,  if we consider either the principles upon which it is founded or the  executive part of it, which prevents the form of government that they  had proposed to follow from being observed; now it is allowed that in  every well-regulated state the members of it should be free from servile  labour; but in what manner this shall be effected is not so easy to  determine; for the Penestse have very often attacked the Thessalians,  and the Helots the Lacedaemonians, for they in a manner continually  watch an opportunity for some misfortune befalling them. But no such  thing has ever happened to the Cretans; the [1269b] reason for which  probably is, that although they are engaged in frequent wars with the  neighbouring cities, yet none of these would enter into an alliance with  the revolters, as it would be disadvantageous for them, who themselves  also have their villains. But now there is perpetual enmity between the  Lacedaemonians and all their neighbours, the Argives, the Messenians,  and the Arcadians. Their slaves also first revolted from the Thessalians  while they were engaged in wars with their neighbours the Acheans, the  Perrabeans, and the Magnesians. It seems to me indeed, if nothing else,  yet something very troublesome to keep upon proper terms with them;  for if you are remiss in your discipline they grow insolent, and think  themselves upon an equality with their masters; and if they are hardly  used they are continually plotting against you and hate you. It is  evident, then, that those who employ slaves have not as yet hit upon the  right way of managing them.    As to the indulging of women in any particular liberties, it is hurtful  to the end of government and the prosperity of the city; for as a man  and his wife are the two parts of a family, if we suppose a city to be  divided into two parts, we must allow that the number of men and women  will be equal.    In whatever city then the women are not under good regulations, we must  look upon one half of it as not under the restraint of law, as it  there happened; for the legislator, desiring to make his whole city  a collection of warriors with respect to the men, he most evidently  accomplished his design; but in the meantime the women were quite  neglected, for they live without restraint in every improper indulgence  and luxury. So that in such a state riches will necessarily be in  general esteem, particularly if the men are governed by their wives,  which has been the case with many a brave and warlike people except  the Celts, and those other nations, if there are any such, who openly  practise pederasty. And the first mythologists seem not improperly to  have joined Mars and Venus together; for all nations of this character  are greatly addicted either to the love of women or of boys, for which  reason it was thus at Lacedaemon; and many things in their state were  done by the authority of the women. For what is the difference, if the  power is in the hands of the women, or in the hands of those whom they  themselves govern? it must turn to the same account. As this boldness of  the women can be of no use in any common occurrences, if it was ever so,  it must be in war; but even here we find that the Lacedaemonian women  were of the greatest disservice, as was proved at the time of the Theban  invasion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other cities,  but made more disturbance than even the enemy.    The origin of this indulgence which the Lacedaemonian women enjoy is  easily accounted for, from the long time the men were absent from home  upon foreign expeditions [1270a] against the Argives, and afterwards the  Arcadians and Messenians, so that, when these wars were at an end, their  military life, in which there is no little virtue, prepared them to obey  the precepts of their law-giver; but we are told, that when Lycurgus  endeavoured also to reduce the women to an obedience to his laws, upon  their refusal he declined it. It may indeed be said that the women were  the causes of these things, and of course all the fault was theirs. But  we are not now considering where the fault lies, or where it does not  lie, but what is right and what is wrong; and when the manners of the  women are not well regulated, as I have already said, it must not only  occasion faults which are disgraceful to the state, but also increase  the love of money. In the next place, fault may be found with his  unequal division of property, for some will have far too much, others  too little; by which means the land will come into few hands, which  business is badly regulated by his laws. For he made it infamous for any  one either to buy or sell their possessions, in which he did right; but  he permitted any one that chose it to give them away, or bequeath them,  although nearly the same consequences will arise from one practice as  from the other. It is supposed that near two parts in five of the whole  country is the property of women, owing to their being so often sole  heirs, and having such large fortunes in marriage; though it would  be better to allow them none, or a little, or a certain regulated  proportion. Now every one is permitted to make a woman his heir if he  pleases; and if he dies intestate, he who succeeds as heir at law gives  it to whom he pleases. From whence it happens that although the country  is able to support fifteen hundred horse and thirty thousand foot, the  number does not amount to one thousand.    And from these facts it is evident, that this particular is badly  regulated; for the city could not support one shock, but was ruined for  want of men. They say, that during the reigns of their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#14)"],[1,"ystery. Corporal Sutton was urgent to go on and complete  the enterprise. All my impulses said the same thing; but then I had  the most explicit injunctions from General Saxton to risk as little as  possible in this first enterprise, because of the fatal effect on public  sentiment of even an honorable defeat. We had now an honorable victory,  so far as it went; the officers and men around me were in good spirits,  but the rest of the column might be nervous; and it seemed so important  to make the first fight an entire success, that I thought it wiser to  let well alone; nor have I ever changed this opinion. For one's self,  Montrose's verse may be well applied, \"To win or lose it all.\" But one  has no right to deal thus lightly with the fortunes of a race, and that  was the weight which I always felt as resting on our action. If my raw  infantry force had stood unflinchingly a night-surprise from \"de  boss cavalry,\" as they reverentially termed them, I felt that a good  beginning had been made. All hope of surprising the enemy's camp was now  at an end; I was willing and ready to fight the cavalry over again, but  it seemed wiser that we, not they, should select the ground.    Attending to the wounded, therefore, and making as we best could  stretchers for those who were to be carried, including the remains  of the man killed at the first discharge (Private William Parsons of  Company G), and others who seemed at the point of death, we marched  through the woods to the landing,--expecting at every moment to be  involved in another fight. This not occurring, I was more than ever  satisfied that we had won a victory; for it was obvious that a mounted  force would not allow a detachment of infantry to march two miles  through open woods by night without renewing the fight, unless they  themselves had suffered a good deal. On arrival at the landing, seeing  that there was to be no immediate affray, I sent most of the men on  board, and called for volunteers to remain on shore with me and hold the  plantation-house till morning. They eagerly offered; and I was glad to  see them, when posted as sentinels by Lieutenants Hyde and Jackson, who  stayed with me, pace their beats as steadily and challenge as coolly  as veterans, though of course there was some powder wasted on imaginary  foes. Greatly to my surprise, however, we had no other enemies to  encounter. We did not yet know that we had killed the first lieutenant  of the cavalry, and that our opponents had retreated to the woods in  dismay, without daring to return to their camp. This at least was the  account we heard from prisoners afterwards, and was evidently the tale  current in the neighborhood, though the statements published in Southern  newspapers did not correspond. Admitting the death of Lieutenant Jones,  the Tallahassee Floridian of February 14th stated that \"Captain Clark,  finding the enemy in strong force, fell back with his command to camp,  and removed his ordnance and commissary and other stores, with twelve  negroes on their way to the enemy, captured on that day.\"    In the morning, my invaluable surgeon, Dr. Rogers, sent me his report  of killed and wounded; and I have been since permitted to make the  following extracts from his notes: \"One man killed instantly by ball  through the heart, and seven wounded, one of whom will die. Braver men  never lived. One man with two bullet-holes through the large muscles of  the shoulders and neck brought off from the scene of action, two miles  distant, two muskets; and not a murmur has escaped his lips. Another,  Robert Sutton, with three wounds,--one of which, being on the skull, may  cost him his life,--would not report himself till compelled to do so by  his officers. While dressing his wounds, he quietly talked of what they  had done, and of what they yet could do. To-day I have had the Colonel  _order_ him to obey me. He is perfectly quiet and cool, but takes this  whole affair with the religious bearing of a man who realizes that  freedom is sweeter than life. Yet another soldier did not report himself  at all, but remained all night on guard, and possibly I should not  have known of his having had a buck-shot in his shoulder, if some duty  requiring a sound shoulder had not been required of him to-day.\" This  last, it may be added, had persuaded a comrade to dig out the buck-shot,  for fear of being ordered on the sick-list. And one of those who were  carried to the vessel--a man wounded through the lungs--asked only if I  were safe, the contrary having been reported. An officer may be pardoned  some enthusiasm for such men as these.    The anxious night having passed away without an attack, another problem  opened with the morning. For the first time, my officers and men found  themselves in possession of an enemy's abode; and though there was but  little temptation to plunder, I knew that I must here begin to draw  the line. I had long since resolved to prohibit absolutely all  indiscriminate pilfering and wanton outrage, and to allow nothing to  be taken or destroyed but by proper authority. The men, to my great  satisfaction, entered into this view at once, and so did (perhaps a  shade less readily, in some cases) the officers. The greatest trouble  was with the steamboat hands, and I resolved to let them go ashore as  little as possible. Most articles of furniture were already, however,  before our visit, gone from the plantation-house, which was now used  only as a picket-station. The only valuable article was a pianoforte,  for which a regular packing-box lay invitingly ready outside. I had made  up my mind, in accordance with the orders given to naval commanders in  that department,* to burn all picket-stations, and all villages from  which I should be covertly attacked, and nothing else; and as this house  was destined to the flames, I should have left the piano in it, but for  the seductions of that box. With such a receptacle all ready, even to  the cover, it would have seemed like flying in the face of Providence  not to put the piano in. I ordered it removed, therefore, and afterwards  presented it to the school for colored children at Fernandina. This  I mention because it was the only article of property I ever took,  or knowingly suffered to be taken, in the enemy's country, save for  legitimate military uses, from first to last; nor would I have taken  this, but for the thought of the school, and, as aforesaid, the  temptation of the box. If any other officer has been more rigid, with  equal opportunities, let him cast the first stone.    * \"It is my desire to avoid the destruction of private property, unless  used for picket or guard-stations, or for other military purposes, by  the enemy.... Of course, if fired upon from any place, it is your duty,  if possible, to destroy it.\" Letter of ADMIRAL DUPONT, commanding South  Atlantic Squadron, to LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER HUGHES of United States  Gunboat Mohawk, Fernandina Harbor.    I think the zest with which the men finally set fire to the house at  my order was enhanced by this previous abstemiousness; but there is a  fearful fascination in the use of fire, which every child knows in the  abstract, and which I found to hold true in the practice. On our way  down river we had opportunity to test this again.    The ruined town of St. Mary's had at that time a bad reputation,  among both naval and military men. Lying but a short distance above  Fernandina, on the Georgia side, it was occasionally visited by our  gunboats. I was informed that the only residents of the town were  three old women, who were apparently kept there as spies,--that, on  our approach, the aged crones would come out and wave white  handkerchiefs,--that they would receive us hospitably, profess to be  profoundly loyal, and exhibit a portrait of Washington,--that they  would solemnly assure us that no Rebel pickets had been there for  many weeks,--but that in the adjoining yard we should find fresh  horse-tracks, and that we should be fired upon by guerillas the moment  we left the wharf. My officers had been much excited by these tales; and  I had assured them that, if this programme were literally carried out,  we would straightway return and burn the town, or what was left of it,  for our share. It was essential to show my officers and men that, while  rigid against irregular outrage, we could still be inexorable against  the enemy.    We had previously planned to stop at this town, on our way down river,  for some valuable lumber which we had espied on a wharf; and gliding  down the swift current, shelling a few bluffs as we passed, we soon  reached it. Punctual as the figures in a panorama appeared the old  ladies with their white handkerchiefs. Taking possession of the town,  much of which had previously been destroyed by the gunboats, and  stationing the color-guard, to their infinite delight, in the cupola  of the most conspicuous house, I deployed skirmishers along the exposed  suburb, and set a detail of men at work on the lumber. After a stately  and decorous interview with the queens of society of St. Mary's,--is  it Scott who says that nothing improves the manners like piracy?--I  peacefully withdrew the men when the work was done. There were faces of  disappointment among the officers,--for all felt a spirit of mischief  after the last night's adventure,--when, just as we had fairly swung out  into the stream and were under way, there came, like the sudden burst of  a tropical tornado, a regular little hail-storm of bullets into the open  end of the boat, driving every gunner in an instant from his post, and  surprising even those who were looking to be surprised. The shock was  but for a second; and though the bullets had pattered precisely like  the sound of hail upon the iron cannon, yet nobody was hurt. With very  respectable promptness, order was restored, our own shells were flying  into the woods from which the attack proceeded, and we"]]]
