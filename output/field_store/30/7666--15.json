[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#14)"],[1,"was a tumult  of yells, screams and cries. He felt something soft against his extended  hand, and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm...    He wanted to be still and the people were lifting him. He believed  afterwards he was carried to the platform and given some drink, but he  was never sure. He did not notice what became of his guide. When his  mind was clear again he was on his feet; eager hands were assisting him  to stand. He was in a big alcove, occupying the position that in his  previous experience had been devoted to the lower boxes. If this was  indeed a theatre.    A mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar, the shouting of a  countless multitude. \"It is the Sleeper! The Sleeper is with us!\"    \"The Sleeper is with us! The Master--the Owner! The Master is with us.  He is safe.\"    Graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people. He saw  no individuals, he was conscious of a froth of pink faces, of waving  arms and garments, he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring  over him, buoying him up. There were balconies, galleries, great  archways giving remoter perspectives, and everywhere people, a vast  arena of people, densely packed and cheering. Across the nearer space  lay the collapsed cable like a huge snake. It had been cut by the men  of the flying machine at its upper end, and had crumpled down into the  hall. Men seemed to be hauling this out of the way. But the whole effect  was vague, the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the  voices.    He stood unsteadily and looked at those about him. Someone supported him  by one arm. \"Let me go into a little room,\" he said, weeping; \"a little  room,\" and could say no more. A man in black stepped forward, took his  disengaged arm. He was aware of officious men opening a door before  him. Someone guided him to a seat. He staggered. He sat down heavily and  covered his face with his hands; he was trembling violently, his nervous  control was at an end. He was relieved of his cloak, he could not  remember how; his purple hose he saw were black with wet. People were  running about him, things were happening, but for some time he gave no  heed to them.    He had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that. He was safe. These were  the people who were on his side. For a space he sobbed for breath,  and then he sat still with his face covered. The air was full of the  shouting of innumerable men.        CHAPTER IX. THE PEOPLE MARCH    He became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his  attention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a  yellow garment. He took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was  glowing. A tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder, and pointed  to the half open door into the hall. This man was shouting close to  his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous  uproar from the great theatre. Behind the man was a girl in a silvery  grey robe, whom Graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be  beautiful. Her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on  him, her lips trembled apart. A partially opened door gave a glimpse  of the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering,  clapping and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a  thunderous pitch, and so continued intermittently all the time that  Graham remained in the little room. He watched the lips of the man in  black and gathered that he was making some clumsy explanation.    He stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up  abruptly; he grasped the arm of this shouting person.    \"Tell me!\" he cried. \"Who am I? Who am I?\"    The others came nearer to hear his words. \"Who am I?\" His eyes searched  their faces.    \"They have told him nothing!\" cried the girl.    \"Tell me, tell me!\" cried Graham.    \"You are the Master of the Earth. You are owner of half the world.\"    He did not believe he heard aright. He resisted the persuasion. He  pretended not to understand, not to hear. He lifted his voice again. \"I  have been awake three days--a prisoner three days. I judge there is some  struggle between a number of people in this city--it is London?\"    \"Yes,\" said the younger man.    \"And those who meet in the great hall with the white Atlas? How does it  concern me? In some way it has to do with me. Why, I don't know. Drugs?  It seems to me that while I have slept the world has gone mad. I have  gone mad.\"    \"Who are those Councillors under the Atlas? Why should they try to drug  me?\"    \"To keep you insensible,\" said the man in yellow.    \"To prevent your interference.\"    \"But _why?_\"    \"Because _you_ are the Atlas, Sire,\" said the man in yellow. \"The world  is on your shoulders. They rule it in your name.\"    The sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one  monotonous voice. Now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came  a deafening tumult, a roaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer,  voices hoarse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted the  people in the little room could not hear each other shout.    Graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had  just heard. \"The Council,\" he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a  name that had struck him. \"But who is Ostrog?\" he said.    \"He is the organiser--the organiser of the revolt. Our Leader--in your  name.\"    \"In my name?--And you? Why is he not here?\"    \"He--has deputed us. I am his brother--his half-brother, Lincoln. He  wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him. That  is why he has sent. He is at the wind-vane offices directing. The people  are marching.\"    \"In your name,\" shouted the younger man. \"They have ruled, crushed,  tyrannised. At last even--\"    \"In my name! My name! Master?\"    The younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder,  indignant and vociferous, a high penetrating voice under his red  aquiline nose and bushy moustache. \"No one expected you to wake. No one  expected you to wake. They were cunning. Damned tyrants! But they were  taken by surprise. They did not know whether to drug you, hypnotise you,  kill you.\"    Again the hall dominated everything.    \"Ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready--. Even now there is a rumour  of fighting beginning.\"      The man who had called himself Lincoln came close to him. \"Ostrog has it  planned. Trust him. We have our organisations ready. We shall seize the  flying stages--. Even now he may be doing that. Then--\"    \"This public theatre,\" bawled the man in yellow, \"is only a contingent.  We have five myriads of drilled men--\"    \"We have arms,\" cried Lincoln. \"We have plans. A leader. Their police  have gone from the streets and are massed in the--\" (inaudible). \"It  is now or never. The Council is rocking--They cannot trust even their  drilled men--\"    \"Hear the people calling to you!\"    Graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds, now dark and  hopeless, now clear and ghastly. He was Master of the Earth, he was a  man sodden with thawing snow. Of all his fluctuating impressions the  dominant ones presented an antagonism; on the one hand was the White  Council, powerful, disciplined, few, the White Council from which he  had just escaped; and on the other, monstrous crowds, packed masses of  indistinguishable people clamouring his name, hailing him Master.  The other side had imprisoned him, debated his death. These shouting  thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him. But why these  things should be so he could not understand.    The door opened, Lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rush  of people followed on the heels of the tumult. These intruders came  towards him and Lincoln gesticulating. The voices without explained  their soundless lips. \"Show us the Sleeper, show us the Sleeper!\" was  the burden of the uproar Men were bawling for \"Order! Silence!\"    Graham glanced towards the open doorway, and saw a tall, oblong picture  of the hall beyond, a waving, incessant confusion of crowded, shouting  faces, men and women together, waving pale blue garments, extended  hands. Many were standing, one man in rags of dark brown, a gaunt  figure, stood on the seat and waved a black cloth. He met the wonder and  expectation of the girl's eyes. What did these people expect from him.  He was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character,  was in some way beating, marching. His own mind, too, changed for a  space he did not recognise the influence that was transforming him.  But a moment that was near to panic passed. He tried to make audible  inquiries of what was required of him.    Lincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was deafened to that. All  the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall. He perceived  what had happened to the uproar. The whole mass of people was chanting  together. It was not simply a song, the voices were gathered together  and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of  an organ, a woven texture of sounds, full of trumpets, full of flaunting  banners, full of the march and pageantry of opening war. And the feet of  the people were beating time--tramp, tramp.    He was urged towards the door. He obeyed mechanically. The strength  of that chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. The hall  opened to him, a vast welter of fluttering colour swaying to the music.    \"Wave your arm to them,\" said Lincoln. \"Wave your arm to them.\"    \"This,\" said a voice on the other side, \"he must have this.\" Arms were  about his neck detaining him in the doorway, and a black subtly-folding  mantle hung from his shoulders. He threw his arm free of this and  followed Lincoln. He perceived the girl in grey close to him, her face  lit, her gesture onward. For the instant she became to him, flushed and  eager as she was, an embodiment of the song. He emerged in the alcove  again. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#14)"],[1,"attle, animating themselves by their song as they had  done before. Tupia, without any directions from the gentlemen of the  Endeavour, began to expostulate with the natives, and told them that  our people had weapons which could destroy them in a moment. Their  answer to this expostulation was, in their own language, 'Come on  shore, and we will kill you all.'--'Well,' replied Tupia, 'but why  should you molest us while we are at sea? As we do not wish to fight,  we shall not accept your challenge to come on shore; and here there is  no pretence for a quarrel, the sea being no more your property than  the ship.' This eloquence, which greatly surprised Lieutenant Cook and  his friends, as they had not suggested to Tupia any of the arguments  he made use of, produced no effect upon the minds of the Indians, who  soon renewed their attack. The oratory of a musket, which was fired  through one of their boats, quelled their courage, and sent them  instantly away.    While our commander was in the Bay of Islands, he had a favourable  opportunity of examining the interior part of the country and its  produce. At daybreak, therefore on the 30th of the month, he set out  in the pinnace and long-boat accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,  and Tupia, and found the inlet, at which they entered, end in a river,  about nine miles above the ship. Up this river, to which was given the  name of the Thames, they proceeded till near noon, when they were  fourteen miles within its entrance. As the gentlemen then found the  face of the country to continue nearly the same, without any  alteration in the course of the stream, and had no hope of tracing it  to its source, they landed on the west side, to take a view of the  lofty trees which every where adorned its banks. The trees were of a  kind which they had seen before, both in Poverty Bay, and Hawke's Bay,  though only at a distance. They had not walked a hundred yards into  the woods, when they met with one of the trees, which, at the height  of six feet above the ground, was nineteen feet eight inches in the  girt. Lieutenant Cook, having a quadrant with him, measured its height  from the root to the first branch, and found it to be eighty-nine  feet. It was as straight as an arrow, and tapered but very little in  proportion to its height; so that, in the lieutenant's judgment, there  must have been three hundred and fifty-six feet of solid timber in it  exclusive of the branches. As the party advanced, they saw many other  trees, which were still larger. A young one they cut down, the wood of  which was heavy and solid, not fit for masts, but such as would make  the finest plank in the world. The carpenter of the ship, who was with  the party, said that the timber resembled that of the pitch-pine,  which is lightened by tapping. If it should appear, that some such  method would be successful in lightening these trees, they would then  furnish masts superior to those of any country in Europe. As the wood  was swampy, the gentlemen could not range far; but they found many  stout trees of other kinds, with which they were totally unacquainted,  and specimens of which they brought away.    On the 22d, another instance occurred in which the commanding officer  left on board did not know how to exercise his power with the good  sense and moderation of Mr. Cook. While some of the natives were in  the ship below with Mr. Banks, a young man, who was upon the deck,  stole a half minute glass, and was detected just as he was carrying it  off. Mr. Hicks, in his indignation against the offender, was pleased  to order that he should be punished, by giving him twelve lashes with  a cat o' nine tails. When the other Indians, who were on board, saw  him seized for the purpose, they attempted to rescue him; and being  resisted, they called for their arms, which were handed from the  canoes. At the same time, the people of one of the canoes attempted to  come up the side of the Endeavour. The tumult having called up Mr.  Banks and Tupia, the natives ran to the latter, and solicited his  interposition. All, however, which he could do, as Mr. hicks continued  inexorable, was to assure them, that nothing was intended against the  life of their companion, and that it was necessary that he should  suffer some punishment for his offence. With this explanation they  appeared to be satisfied; and when the punishment had been inflicted,  an old man among the spectators, who was supposed to be the criminal's  father, gave him a severe beating, and sent him down into his canoe.  Notwithstanding this, the Indians were far from being reconciled to  the treatment which their countryman had received. Their cheerful  confidence was gone; and though they promised, at their departure, to  return with some fish, the English saw them no more.    On the 29th of November, Lieutenant Cook, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and  others with them, were in a situation somewhat critical and alarming.  Having landed upon an island in the neighbourhood of Cape Bret, they  were in a few minutes surrounded by two or three hundred people.  Though the Indians were all armed, they came on in so confused and  straggling a manner, that it did not appear that any injury was  intended by them; and the English gentlemen were determined that  hostilities should not begin on their part. At first the natives  continued quiet; but their weapons were held ready to strike, and they  seemed to be rather irresolute than peaceable. While the lieutenant  and his friends remained in a state of suspense, another party of  Indians came up; and the boldness of the whole body being increased by  the augmentation of their numbers, they began the dance and song,  which are their preludes to a battle. An attempt, that was made by a  number of them, to seize the two boats which had brought our voyagers  to land, appeared to be the signal for a general attack. It now became  necessary for Mr. Cook to exert himself with vigour Accordingly, he  discharged his musket, which was loaded with small shot, at one of the  forwardest of the assailants, and Mr. Banks, and two of our men, fired  immediately afterwards. Though this made the natives fall back in some  confusion, nevertheless, one of the chiefs, who was at the distance of  about twenty yards, had the courage to rally them, and, calling loudly  to his companions, led them on to the charge. Dr. Solander instantly  discharged his piece at this champion, who, upon feeling the shot,  stopped short, and then ran away with the rest of his countrymen.  Still, however, they did not disperse, but got upon rising ground, and  seemed only to want some leader of resolution to renew their assault.  As they were now gotten beyond the reach of small shot, the English  fired with ball, none of which taking place, the Indians continued  together in a body. While our people were in this doubtful situation,  which lasted about a quarter of an hour, the ship, from which a much  greater number of natives were seen than could be discovered on shore,  brought her broad side to bear, and entirely dispersed them, by firing  a few shot over their heads. In this skirmish, only two of them were  hurt with the small shot, and not a single life was lost; a case which  would not have happened if Lieutenant Cook had not restrained his men,  who either from fear or the love of mischief, shewed as much  impatience to destroy the Indians, as a sportsman to kill his game.  Such was the difference between the disposition of the common seamen  and marines, and that of their humane and judicious commander.    On the same day Mr. Cook displayed a very exemplary act of discipline.  Some of the ship's people, who when the natives were to be punished  for a fraud, assumed the inexorable justice of a Lycurgus, thought fit  to break into one of their plantations, and to dig up a quantity of  potatoes. For this the lieutenant ordered each of them to receive  twelve lashes, after which two of them were discharged. But the third,  in a singular strain of morality, insisted upon it, that it was no  crime in an Englishman to plunder an Indian plantation. The method  taken by our commander to refute his casuistry, was to send him back  to his confinement, and not, permit him to be released, till he had  been punished with six lashes more.    The Endeavour, on the 5th of December, was in the most imminent hazard  of being wrecked. At four o'clock in the morning of that day our  voyagers weighed, with a light breeze; but it being variable with  frequent calms, they made little way. From that time till the  afternoon they kept turning out of the bay, and about ten at night  were suddenly becalmed, so that the ship could neither wear nor  exactly keep her station. The tide or current setting strong, she  drove toward land so fast; that before any measures could be taken for  her security, she was within a cable's length of the breakers. Though  our people had thirteen fathom water, the ground was so foul, that  they did not dare to drop their anchor. In this crisis the pinnace  being immediately hoisted out to take the ship in tow, and the men  sensible of their danger, exerted themselves to the utmost, a faint  breeze sprang up off the land, and our navigators perceived, with  unspeakable joy, that the vessel made headway. So near was she to the  shore, that Tupia, who was ignorant of the hair's breadth escape the  company had experienced, was at this very time conversing with the  Indians upon the beach, whose voices were distinctly heard,  notwithstanding the roar of the breakers. Mr. Cook and his friends now  thought that all danger was over; but about an hour afterwards, just  as the man in the chains had cried 'seventeen fathom,' the ship  struck. The shock threw them into the utmost consternation: and almost  instantly the man in the chains cried out 'five fathom.' By this time,  the rock on which the ship had struck being to the windward, she went"]]]
