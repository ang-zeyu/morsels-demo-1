And there can be no dispute that the most valuable financial asset of  the ordinary woman is the possibility that a man may be willing--and  may, if only woman is disposed to fulfil her part of the bargain, be  not only willing but anxious--to support her and to secure for her, if  he can, a measure of that freedom which comes from the possession of  money.    In view of this every one who has a real fellow-feeling for woman, and  who is concerned for her material welfare, as a father is concerned  for his daughter's, will above everything else desire to nurture and  encourage in man the sentiment of chivalry, and in woman that  disposition of mind that makes chivalry possible.    And the woman workers who have to fight the battle of life for  themselves would indirectly profit from this fostering of chivalry;  for those women who are supported by men do not compete in the limited  labour market which is open to the woman worker.    From every point of view, therefore, except perhaps that of the  exceptional woman who would be able to hold her own against masculine  competition--and men always issue informal letters of naturalisation  to such an exceptional woman--the woman suffrage which leads up to  feminism would be a social disaster.      PART III    IS THERE, IF THE SUFFRAGE IS BARRED, ANY PALLIATIVE OF CORRECTIVE FOR  THE DISCONTENTS OF WOMAN?    I    PALLIATIVES OR CORRECTIVES FOR THE DISCONTENTS OF WOMAN    What are the Suffragist's Grievances?--Economic and Physiological  Difficulties of Woman--Intellectual Grievances of Suffragist and  Corrective.    Is there then, let us ask ourselves, if the suffrage with its  programme of feminism is barred as leading to social disaster, any  palliative or corrective that can be applied to the present  discontents of woman?    If such is to be found, it is to be found only by placing clearly  before us the suffragist's grievances.    These grievances are, _first,_ the economic difficulties of the woman  who seeks to earn her living by work other than unskilled manual  labour; _secondly_, the difficult physiological conditions in which  woman is placed by the excess of the female over the male population  and by her diminished chances of marriage [1]; and _thirdly,_ the  tedium which obsesses the life of the woman who is not forced, and  cannot force herself, to work. On the top of these grievances comes  the fact that the suffragist conceives herself to be harshly and  unfairly treated by man. This last is the fire which sets a light to  all the inflammable material.    [1] _Vide_ footnote, p. 138.    It would be quite out of question to discuss here the economic and  physiological difficulties of woman. Only this may be said: it is  impossible, in view of the procession of starved and frustrated lives  which is continuously filing past, to close one's eyes to the urgency  of this woman's problem.    After all, the primary object of all civilisation is to provide for  every member of the community food and shelter and fulfilment of  natural cravings. And when, in what passes as a civilised community, a  whole class is called upon to go without any one of these our human  requirements, it is little wonder that it should break out.    But when a way of escape stands open revolt is not morally justified.    Thus, for example, a man who is born into, but cannot support himself  in, a superior class of society is not, as long as he can find a  livelihood abroad in a humbler walk in life, entitled to revolt.    No more is the woman who is in economic or physiological difficulties.  For, if only she has the pluck to take it, a way of escape stands open  to her.    She can emigrate; she can go out from the social class in which she is  not self-supporting into a humbler social class in which she could  earn a living; and she can forsake conditions in which she must remain  a spinster for conditions in which she may perhaps become a mother.  Only in this way can the problem of finding work, and relief of  tedium, for the woman who now goes idle be resolved.    If women were to avail themselves of these ways of escape out of  unphysiological conditions, the woman agitator would probably find it  as difficult to keep alive a passionate agitation for woman suffrage  as the Irish Nationalist agitator to keep alive, after the settlement  of the land question and the grant of old age pensions, a passionate  agitation for a separate Parliament for Ireland.    For the happy wife and mother is never passionately concerned about  the suffrage. It is always the woman who is galled either by  physiological hardships, or by the fact that she has not the same  amount of money as man, or by the fact that man does not desire her as  a co-partner in work, and withholds the homage which she thinks he  ought to pay to her intellect.    For this class of grievances the present education of woman is  responsible. The girl who is growing up to woman's estate is never  taught where she stands relatively to man. She is not taught anything  about woman's physical disabilities. She is not told--she is left to  discover it for herself when too late--that child and husband are to  woman physiological requirements. She is not taught the defects and  limitations of the feminine mind. One might almost think there were no  such defects and limitations; and that woman was not always  overestimating her intellectual power. And the ordinary girl is not  made to realise woman's intrinsically inferior money-earning capacity.  She is not made to realise that the woman who cannot work with her  hands is generally hard put to earn enough to keep herself alive in  the incomplete condition of a spinster.    As a result of such education, when, influenced by the feminist  movement, woman comes to institute a comparison between herself and  man, she brings into that comparison all those qualities in which she  is substantially his equal, and leaves out of account all those in  which she is his inferior.    The failure to recognise that man is the master, and why he is the  master, lies at the root of the suffrage movement. By disregarding  man's superior physical force, the power of compulsion upon which all  government is based is disregarded. By leaving out of account those  powers of the mind in which man is the superior, woman falls into the  error of thinking that she can really compete with him, and that she  belongs to the self-same intellectual caste. Finally, by putting out  of sight man's superior money-earning capacity, the power of the purse  is ignored.    Uninstructed woman commits also another fundamental error in her  comparison. Instead of comparing together the average man and the  average woman, she sets herself to establish that there is no defect  in woman which cannot be discovered also in man; and that there is no  virtue or power in the ordinary man which cannot be discovered also in  woman. Which having been established to her satisfaction, she is led  inevitably to the conclusion that there is nothing whatever to choose  between the sexes. And from this there is only a step to the position  that human beings ought to be assigned, without distinction of sex, to  each and every function which would come within the range of their  individual capacities, instead of being assigned as they are at  present: men to one function, and women to another.    Here again women ought to have been safeguarded by education.  She  ought to have been taught that even when an individual woman comes up  to the average of man this does not abrogate the disqualification  which attaches to a difference of sex. Nor yet--as every one who  recognises that we live in a world which conducts itself by  generalisations will see--does it abrogate the disqualification of  belonging to an inferior intellectual caste.    The present system of feminine education is blameworthy not only in  the respect that it fails to draw attention to these disqualifications  and to teach woman where she stands; it is even more blameworthy in  that it fails to convey to the girl who is growing up any conception  of that absolutely elementary form of morality which consists in  distinguishing _meum_ and _tuum_ [_that which is mine_ and _that which  is yours_].    Instead of her educators encouraging every girl to assert \"rights\" as  against man, and put forward claims, they ought to teach her with  respect to him those lessons of behaviour which are driven home once  for all into every boy at a public school.    Just as there you learn that you may not make unwarranted demands upon  your fellow, and just as in the larger world every nation has got to  learn that it cannot with impunity lay claim to the possessions of its  neighbours, so woman will have to learn that when things are not  offered to her, and she has not the power to take them by force, she  has got to make the best of things as they are.    One would wish for every girl who is growing up to womanhood that it  might be brought home to her by some refined and ethically-minded  member of her own sex how insufferable a person woman becomes when,  like a spoilt child, she exploits the indulgence of man; when she  proclaims that it is his duty to serve her and to share with her his  power and possessions; when she makes an outcry when he refuses to  part with what is his own; and when she insists upon thrusting her  society upon men everywhere.    And every girl ought to be warned that to embark upon a policy of  recrimination when you do not get what you want, and to proclaim  yourself a martyr when, having hit, you are hit back, is the way to  get yourself thoroughly disliked.    Finally, every girl ought to be shown, in the example of the militant  suffragist, how revolt and martyrdom, undertaken in order to possess  oneself of what belongs to others, effects the complete  disorganisation of moral character.    No one would wish that in the education of girls these quite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#14)"],[1,"should have explained you saw off the trunk just  above the honey so the bees can get away from the smoke and the old  tree will draw like a chimney--you set a fuse to a stick of dynamite,  toss it in the fire and run like hell. Well, sir, the dynamite goes  off and just naturally shoots the old roast bear out the tree like a  projectile. Then you pick it up, lug it back to the picnic grounds,  and I tell you, Mr. Tompkins, it's mighty sweet eating. Now this time  we nigh hit the Governor of North Carolina, he was making a political  speech over at the old fair grounds, and--\"    \"I think I get the picture, Harcourt,\" I said, cutting in on him  rapidly. \"We did pretty much the same thing with baby seals and popcorn  in the Aleutians. When we were after Jap subs, the depth-charges killed  no end of baby seals--concussion, I guess. So we'd pick 'em up in a  life-boat, clean them, stuff them with unpopped popcorn, and stick  them in the fourteen-inch guns. Then we'd touch off a reduced charge  behind 'em. Seals are naturally oily so they went out the muzzle like  a regular shell. The intense heat of the explosion not only cooked the  seal but popped the popcorn. That puffed out, set up air resistance and  reduced trajectory. Then we'd send a helicopter out to pick 'em up and  have 'em in mess. Cold with chili sauce, they were delicious. One time  when we were bombarding Attu, the crew of No. 3 turret forgot we had a  seal in the center gun and fired it at a Jap redoubt. It hit--\"    \"I can see,\" Arthurjean remarked, \"that I've been missing a lot of fun  here in New York, though I'll never forget the time we pretended we  found a dead mouse in a mince pie at the Waldorf--Now, who in hell can  _that_ be?\"    The door-bell rang insistently.    Harcourt looked a little uneasy. \"I thought it might save a lot of time  and trouble,\" he said, \"if I asked Mrs. Tompkins to meet us here. I  told her that Miss Briggs was a friend of mine--sugar, you'd better  go in the other room and put on red night-things--so you don't need  something more _de trop_ than those to worry, Mr. Tompkins.\"    \"That's just dandy, Harcourt,\" I agreed. \"Did you ever see a wife who  couldn't spot a sex-situation at a hundred yards up-wind on a dark and  rainy night?\"    \"Can't say I did,\" the Special Agent admitted, \"but I've never had but  one wife and she's busy with the kids.\"    There was a knock on the door and Harcourt opened it with a courtly  manner.    \"Come right in, Mrs. Tompkins,\" he said. \"My friend, Miss Briggs, is in  the other room and will be out in a moment. Mr. Tompkins and I--\"    \"This,\" said Germaine, \"is Mrs. Rutherford. After Winnie didn't turn  up for a couple of nights, we put our heads together and decided that  two could worry as cheaply as one. So when I got your message, I just  phoned Virginia and here we are. Hullo, Winnie, is this another of your  homes away from home?\"    Virginia Rutherford looked pretty much the way a roasting bear in a  bee-tree might be expected to feel while waiting for the dynamite to  explode: very sweet, red-hot and not giving a damn whether she hit the  Governor of the Old North State.    \"Hullo, Winnie,\" she remarked dangerously. \"This another of your  tousled blondes?\"    \"I resent that,\" Arthurjean said from the doorway. \"This is _my_  flat and I didn't invite you and I'll have you know that I'm a very  respectable--well, rather respectable--working girl.\"    The effect of virtue was only slightly marred by the fact that, as she  spoke, a pair of silk panties slowly but inexorably slid below the hem  of her skirt and settled in a shimmer at her feet. Arthurjean looked  down.    \"Oh, hell, girls,\" she said, \"What's the use? Have a drink!\"    \"Thank you, Miss Briggs,\" Germaine replied. \"I will. Make mine straight  Scotch and the same for Mrs. Rutherford. Are you, by any chance,  employed in my husband's office?\"    \"I'm his secretary,\" Arthurjean admitted.    \"Winnie,\" Jimmie turned on me with a snap like those doors in Penn  Station which open by an electric eye, \"and you swore that you had  nothing to do with the office-girls. I was fool enough to believe you.\"    \"At the time, dear,\" I explained guiltily, \"I didn't know it myself.\"    Harcourt came lumbering to my rescue. \"Before you leap to any  conclusions, Mrs. Tompkins,\" he urged, \"I think I ought to explain that  I represent the F.B.I. and that Mr. Tompkins came here today at my  request. Your husband happens to be in very serious trouble under the  Espionage Act. I personally am convinced that there's been a mistake  and that he's innocent, but my opinion is of no value unless I can  find evidence to support it.\"    \"What's he done?\" Virginia Rutherford asked eagerly. \"Will he go to  jail?\"    \"Unfortunately, Mrs. Rutherford,\" Harcourt replied, \"I'm not allowed  to discuss the nature of the charges against him. No formal indictment  has been lodged and if you can help me, none will be made. The  important thing is to know where he was and what he was doing from the  twenty-fifth of March until the second of April.\"    \"Why the twenty-fifth of March?\" my wife demanded. \"He was with me at  Bedford Hills most of that time. I, and the maid at the house, Myrtle,  can testify to that. I don't think he went to the office much that  week. It was Holy Week. He and I went to church.\"    \"Mrs. Tompkins,\" he said, \"you are a true and noble lady. It's just too  bad that one of our agents has already interviewed the Hubble girl, who  testified that Mr. Tompkins didn't come home once all that week.\"    Germaine sank back in her chair and looked at me with an air of  misplaced consecration. \"Winnie,\" she urged, \"go ahead and tell him  where you were. I'm your wife and I don't care what silliness you were  up to or what woman you were with, just so they don't send you to  prison.\"    I smiled at her. \"Jimmie,\" I replied, \"I give you my word, I simply  don't remember. I don't know where I was. As I told you the other day,  I've drawn a blank as to what happened before last Monday afternoon.\"    Mrs. Rutherford took advantage of the moment of incredulous silence  which followed this announcement.    \"Don't try to be chivalrous, Winnie,\" she urged me. \"We hadn't planned  to advertise it, Jimmie, but Winnie spent that week with me. He rented  a flat for me uptown, Mr. Harcourt, about six weeks ago, and we put in  a whole week together. I daresay you think I'm a loose woman but--\"    Harcourt looked quite painfully embarrassed. \"I surely do not want to  contradict a lady,\" he told her, \"but the Bureau checked up on that  apartment yesterday. The janitor and the cleaning woman both stated  that, except for last Monday afternoon and evening when you were there  by yourself, neither you nor Mr. Tompkins had been near the place for  at least two weeks. The bed linen and the bath towels hadn't been used  and the food in the ice-box was stale. There had been no garbage.\"    \"Oh!\" flared Virginia, \"of all the low-down snoopers!\"    \"The country's at war, Mrs. Rutherford,\" the Special Agent replied.  \"And while I'm at it I might as well save Miss Briggs the trouble of  telling me that Mr. Tompkins spent that week here with her. He did not.  We've checked this apartment house most thoroughly, as well as Mr.  Tompkins' office.\"    \"Why that particular week?\" I asked.    Harcourt turned to me apologetically. \"In view of your earlier  statements to me,\" he declared, \"I'm sure you will understand this  explanation. A certain ship did not sail from a certain port until the  26th of March. A certain article was not delivered on board that ship  until after she had sailed. Before then, the individual who brought  the article to the ship had no knowledge which ship had been selected.  Before then, nobody on that ship had any knowledge that any article  would be brought on board and had no knowledge of the nature of its  voyage. Whatever arrangements were made must have been made during the  following few days. That, at any rate, is the working theory the Bureau  has adopted. Have you no idea of where you might have been in that  period, Mr. Tompkins?\"    I placed my head in my hands and thought back to that misty morning  ten days before, when the Alaska pulled out of Bremerton Navy Yard and  headed north through Puget Sound for Victoria and the Strait of Juan  de Fuca. I remembered how, as we returned recognition signals to the  Canadian base at Esquimault, a destroyer had put out, come alongside  and put a civilian passenger aboard us. I remembered the fuss he raised  on the bridge while we made a lee for the destroyer and hoisted a large  packing-case on board, and how it was hurried below decks with a Marine  guard. Then I thought of the run out west, past Dutch Harbor and Adak,  our light carrier slipping through the drifting fogs of the Aleutians,  while the slow Pacific swell pounded against our port beam and the  turbines whined and ship shook and the icy wind whipped across the  flight-deck. And I remembered that last night in the mess when Windy  Smith--of Texas, naturally--boasted that he--    \"No, Mr. Harcourt,\" I told him, \"I'm afraid that the things I remember  wouldn't help either of us. You go ahead and see what you can find out  about me, and so will I.\"    \"Winnie,\" Germaine said reproachfully. \"Tell him where you were, dear.  It's no use pretending that you don't remember. I know that you can  explain. I know there's nothing _really_ wrong.\"    Arthurjean walked across and put her hand on Jimmie's arm. \"You'd  better have another drink, Mrs. Tompkins,\" she remarked, \"and so had I.  This sort of thing is tough to take.\"    Virginia looked up brightly at Harcourt. \"If Winnie won't help himself,  I will,\" she said. \"I'll find out what the big dope was doing and when  I do--look out!\"    \"Come on, Jimmie,\" I told my wife. \"Let's go home. I've had about as  much of this as I can stand. Harcourt, you know where you can reach me,  if you get the word"]]]
