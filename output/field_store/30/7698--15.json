In his being there were happily  blended his mother's joyous fancy and the sterner traits of his father.  Thus a rich imagination, a wealth of feeling, and the power of poetic  expression went hand in hand with an indomitable will. In the spring of  1770 the young poet went to Strassburg to complete his law course. There  Herder happened to be, even then a famed critic and scholar, and he  aroused in Goethe a love and understanding of what was really great and  genuine in literature: especially Homer, the Bible, Shakspere, and the  _Volkslied_ i.e., the simple folksong. In the fall of the year Goethe met  Friederike Brion in the parsonage at Sesenheim, a village near  Strassburg. Now Herder's teaching bore fruit in an outburst of real song  (1, 2 and 4). The influence of the _Volkslied_ is clearly discernible in  the unaffected naturalness, spontaneity, and simplicity of these lyrics.  Thus _das Heidenröslein_, which symbolizes the tragic close of the sweet  idyll of Sesenheim, is to all intents and purposes a _Volkslied_.    The following years, spent for the most part in Frankfurt, were the  period of _Sturm und Drang_ (Storm and Stress) in the poet's life and  work. His love for Lili Schönemann, a rich banker's daughter and society  belle of Frankfurt, only heightened this unrest (3). In the fall of 1775  the young duke Karl August called Goethe to Weimar. Under the influence  of Frau von Stein, a woman of rare culture, Goethe developed to calm  maturity. Compare the first _Wanderers Nachtlied_ (written February  1776), a passionate prayer for peace, and the; second (written September  1780), the embodiment of that peace attained. Even more important in this  development is the fact that Goethe, in assuming his many official  positions in the little dukedom, entered voluntarily a circle of everyday  duties (7 and 8). Thus the heaven-storming Titan, as Goethe reveals  himself in his _Prometheus_, learns to respect and revere the natural  limitations of mortality (15 and especially 16).    As Goethe matured, his affinity for classic antiquity became more marked,  and a consuming desire impelled him to spend two years in Italy  (1786-1788). The rest of his years Goethe spent in Weimar, his life  enriched above all else by his friendship with Schiller. In this second  Weimar period Goethe reached the acme of his powers. Even his declining  years, although marked by loneliness and bringing him a full measure of  grief (his wife, Christiane Vulpius, whom he had met shortly after his  return from Italy, died in 1816, followed in 1830 by his only son),  exemplified that earnest striving so characteristic of Goethe. A serene  optimism, a deep love of life, was his to the very last. To this _das  Lied des Türmers_, written May 1831, bears eloquent witness. A ripe  mellowness seems to blend here with the joyous spirit of youth. Goethe  died March 22, 1832.      1. A visit to Sesenheim is the experience that called forth this poem.  (Compare Goethe's first letter to Friederike, October 15, 1770) Notice  how all nature is personified and assumes human attributes. In the  opening stanzas impetuous haste is stirring, the first two lines have a  marked rising rhythm. Notice the quieting effect of the metrical  inversion at the beginning of 17, 18, and 19 and of the break in 25 after  ach and how the whole poem ends with a note of deep joy.        15, 16. WELCHES, WELCHE = _what_.        21. ROSENFARBNES FRÜHLINGSWETTER, _the roseate hues of spring-time._        29. ERDEN, old dative singular.      2. Notice that the second and third stanzas are joined as also the last  three. The exuberant fullness of joy creates its own form and overleaps  the confines of a single stanza.      3. Written June 1775 in Switzerland on Lake Zürich. Goethe had gone there  to escape the unrest into which his love for Lili Schönemann had thrown  him. The poem opens with a shout of exultation, 1 and 2; note the  inversion -- XX -- X -- _Saug' ich aus freier Welt_. The rising rhythm of  the following lines clearly depicts the movement of rapid rowing. Stanza  2 changes to a falling rhythm; as pictures of the past rise up, the  rowing ceases. Stanza 3 depicts a more quiet forward movement; notice the  effect of the dactyls in the even lines.        15. TRINKEN, metaphorically for _envelop, cause to disappear._      4. The refrain, so common in the _Volkslied_ does not only enhance the  melody of the poem, but centers the entire attention on das Röslein and  retards the quick dramatic movement of the narrative, which latter is  heightened by the omission of the article and the frequent inversion of  the verb.        2. HEIDEN, old dative.        3. MORGENSCHÖN, the rose has all the fresh pure beauty of the early      morning.        18. WEH UND ACH, _cry of pain, piteous outcry._      5. For this and the following poem compare Longfellow's translation.      6. EIN GLEICHES, i.e., another _Wanderers Nachtlied_. This poem has been  justly called _die Krone aller Lyrik_, _the acme of all lyric poetry_,  because of its simple, perfect beauty.      8. ERINNERUNG, _reminder_.      9. Written in 1813 in memory of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the day  when the poet had first met Christiane Vulpius. Its never failing charm  lies in its utter simplicity, its _Selbstverständigkeit_, and in this one  respect it may well be compared to Wordsworth's Lucy (\"She dwelt among  the untrodden ways\").        1 and 2. FÜR SICH (i.e., _vor sich_) HINGEHEN, _to saunter along, to      walk along without any special purpose._      10. Mignon, a fascinating character in Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister, a  strange premature child, expresses in this song her longing for her  Italian land. In succinct pictures there arise before us her native land,  her ancestral home and the way thither. The very soul of this poem is  longing, culminating with ever increasing intensity in the refrain. Note  the vivid concreteness of the verbs and the noble simplicity of the  adjectives; the vowels, especially in 2.        13. WOLKENSTEG, _bridge that hangs on clouds_ (Carlyle).        16. STÜRZT, _plunges down_, i.e., descends precipitously.      11. The _Harfenspieler_ has, without knowing it, married his own sister.  Mignon is the child of this union. In this song he pours forth his  despair and the torments of his conscience.      12. Thule is a mythical land of the far North.        3. STERBEND modifies _Buhle_.        7. _his eyes overflowed with tears._        8. SO OFT, _as often as._        12. ZUGLEICH, i.e., with his other possessions.        15. AUF, translate _in_. Why _auf_?        21, 22. Note the descriptive effect of the enjambement together with      the internal rhyme.        23. _His eyes closed_ (in death), TÄTEN SINKEN = _sanken_. _Täten_ is      an older preterite indicative.      13. The poem embodies the lure of the water. This motif is clearly  expressed in 1 and is repeated in 25. In 9, 13, 29 and 31 metrically the  same motif recurs. Compare 9 and 29: the speech becomes song and the lure  of the nymph's song draws the fisherman down.        4. _cool to his very heart_.        6. _The flood swells up and divides_ (as the body emerges from it).      Note effect of the inversion -- XX -- X --.        13. FISCHLEIN, dative. MIR IST = _I feel_.        16. ERST, _now for the first time_.        19. WELLENATMEND. The word pictures graphically the rise and fall of      the sun's image in the waves.        20. DOPPELT SCHÖNER = _doppelt schön_.        22. DAS FEUCHTVERKLÄRTE BLAU, _The azure of the sky transfigured in      the water_.        30. _Then he was doomed_. Compare the expression: \"he is done for.\"      14. ERLKÖNIG is a corruption of _Elbkönig_, i.e., the king of the elves.  Notice the difference in the speeches of the three characters: the calm  assuaging tone of the father, whose senses seem dead to the supernatural;  the luring song of the Erlkönig, that changes abruptly to an impetuous  demand; the ever increasing terror of the child till its fear is imparted  to the father. The child's speech is driven relentlessly forward by  terror; notice the effect of the inversion in 22 and 28: -- XX --, etc.        19. FÜHREN DEN NÄCHTLICHEN REIHN, _dance the nightly round_.        20. _and rock thee and dance thee and sing thee to sleep_.        28. _Erlking has done me grievous woe_.      15. Suggested by the Staubbach, a cascade near Lauterbrunnen in  Switzerland (October 1779). The poem compares human life in its various  aspects to a stream. Notice in this connection how the rhythm varies from  stanza to stanza.        12. WOLKENWELLEN, _cloudlike waves_.        24. HIN, _along_.        26. WEIDEN, _let graze or feast_, i.e., mirror.        30. MISCHT VOM GRUND AUS, _stirs from the very bottom._      16. Willing surrender, contented submission to the will of the Highest is  the keynote of this poem.        9. _childlike thrills of awe._        40, 41. IHRES DASEINS. _Ihres_ refers to _Geschlechter_. To make it      refer to _Götter_ (and adopting the variant reading _sie_ [i.e.,      _Götter_] instead of _sich_) makes an impossible metaphor, since the      picture of a chain with its links cannot describe the eternal and      changeless life of the gods, but only human life, generation      following generation as link on link in a chain. Compare 31, where      Goethe has used _Wellen_ with the same purport.      17. Although a part of _Faust_, this poem is none the less a confession  of Goethe himself. Over eighty years old, the poet surveys life as a  watchman from his high tower, lets his gaze once more wander over the  world, when evening comes, and lo, all is good.        11, 12. _And as all things have pleased me, I am pleased with      myself_, i.e., the sum total of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8567"],[0,"The Iroquois Book of Rites (#14)"],[1,"worthless. A  lavish display and reckless destruction of wealth were deemed honors due  to the shades of the departed. [Footnote: See the _Relation_ for 1636,  p. 131. A most vivid and graphic description of these extraordinary  ceremonies is given in Parkman's admirable work, _The Jesuits in North  America_, Chapter 7.]    The Attiwandaronks, or Neutrals, who were the nearest neighbors of the  Iroquois, were still more extravagant in their demonstrations of  affection for their lost friends. They, too, had their feasts of the  dead, at regular intervals. In the meantime the bodies were kept in  their houses as long as possible--\"until the stench became intolerable.\"  Then, when this proximity could no longer be borne, the remains were  left for a period to decay on a scaffold in the open air. After a time  the remaining flesh was removed from the bones, which were arranged on  the sides of their cabins, in full view of the inmates, until the great  day of general interment. With these mournful objects before their eyes,  renewing constantly the sense of their loss, the women of the household  were excited to frequent outbursts of grief, expressed in wailing  chants. [Footnote: \"Cet object qu'ils ont devant les yeux, leur  renouvellant continuellement le resentiment de leurs pertes, leur fait  ordinairement letter des cris, et faire des lamentations tout a fait  lugubres, le tout en chanson. Mais cela ne se fait que par les  femmes.\"--_Relation_ of 1641, p. 73.]    That the Iroquois in ancient times had funeral customs similar to those  of their sister nations, and not less revolting, cannot be doubted. How  these shocking and pernicious usages were abolished at one swoop is  shown by the brief passage in the Book of Rites now under discussion.  The injunctions are laconic, but full of meaning. When a death occurs,  the people are told, \"this shall be done.\" A delegation of persons,  officially appointed for the purpose, shall repair to the dwelling of  the deceased, bearing in a pouch some strands of mourning wampum. The  leader, holding these strands, and standing by the hearth, shall  address, in the name of the whole people, a few words of comfort to the  mourners. And then \"they shall be comforted,\" and shall go on with their  usual duties. To this simple ceremony--supplemented, in the case of a  high chief, by the rites of the \"Condoling Council,\"--the preposterous  funeral usages, which pervaded the lives and wasted the wealth of the  other nations of this stock, were reduced, by the wisdom of the Iroquois  legislators.    In considering these remarkable laws, it becomes evident that the work  which Hiawatha and Dekanawidah accomplished was really a Great  Reformation, not merely political, but also social and religious. They  desired not only to establish peace among the nations, but also to  abolish or modify such usages and beliefs as in their opinion were  injurious to their people. It is deserving of notice that a divinity  unknown, at least in name, to the Hurons, received special reverence  among the Iroquois. The chief characters of the Huron pantheon were a  female deity, Ataensic, a sort of Hecate, whom they sometimes identified  with the moon, and her grandson, Juskeha, who was sometimes regarded as  the sun, and as a benevolent spirit, but most commonly in their stories  appears as a fantastic and capricious goblin, with no moral attributes  whatever. In the Iroquois mythology these deities are replaced by a  personage of a much higher character. Taronhiawagon, the Holder of the  Heavens, was with them the Master of Life. He declared his will to them  in dreams, and in like manner disclosed future events, particularly such  as were important to the public welfare. He was, in fact, the national  god of the Iroquois. It was he who guided their fathers in their early  wanderings, when they were seeking for a place of abode. He visited them  from time to time, in person, to protect them from their enemies and to  instruct them in useful arts.    It is possible that the Iroquois Taronhiawagon may have been originally  the same as the Huron Juskeha. Some eminent authorities on Indian  mythology are inclined to this opinion. On the other hand, the earlier  Jesuit missionaries give no hint of such identity, and the Tuscarora  historian, Cusick, seems to distinguish between these divine personages.  But whether we accept this view or seek for any other origin, there  seems reason to suppose that the more exalted conception of this deity,  who is certainly, in character and attributes, one of the noblest  creations of the North American mythologies, dates from the era of the  confederacy, when he became more especially the chief divinity and  protector of the Kanonsionni. [Footnote: See for Taronhiawagon the  Jesuit _Relations_ for 1670, pp. 47, 66, and for 1671, p. 17: also  Cusick, pp. 20, 22, 24, 34. For Juskeha, see the _Relation_ for 1635, p.  34; 1636, pp. 101-103; 1640, p. 92. Lafitau in one place makes  Tharonhiawagon a deified man, and in another the grandson of  Ataensic.--_Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains_, Vol. 1. p. 146 and p.  244.]          CHAPTER VII.    HISTORICAL TRADITIONS.      After the declaration of the laws of the League, there follows a passage  of great historical importance. The speaker recites the names of the  chiefs who represented the Five Nations in the conference by which the  work of devising their laws and establishing their government was  accomplished. The native name of the confederacy is here for the first  time mentioned. In the guttural and rather irregular orthography of the  Book it is spelt _Kanonghsyonny_. The Roman Catholic missionaries,  neglecting the aspirate, which in the Iroquois pronunciation appears and  disappears as capriciously as in the spoken dialects of the south of  England, write the word Kanonsionni. It is usually rendered by  interpreters the \"Long House,\" but this is not precisely its meaning.  The ordinary word for \"long house\" is _kanonses_ or _kanonsis_,--the  termination _es_ or _is_ being the adjective suffix which signifies  _long_. _Kanonsionni_ is a compound word, formed of _kanonsa_, _house_,  and _ionni_, extended, or drawn out. The confederacy was compared to a  dwelling which was extended by additions made to the end, in the manner  in which their bark-built houses were lengthened,--sometimes to an  extent exceeding two hundred feet. When the number of families  inhabiting these long dwellings was increased by marriage or adoption,  and a new hearth was required, the end-wall,--if this term may be  applied to the slight frame of poles and bark which closed the  house,--was removed, an addition of the required size was made to the  edifice, and the closing wall was restored. Such was the figure by which  the founders of the confederacy represented their political structure, a  figure which was in itself a description and an invitation. It declared  that the united nations were not distinct tribes, associated by a  temporary league, but one great family, clustered for convenience about  separate hearths in a common dwelling; and it proclaimed their readiness  to receive new members into the general household. [Footnote: The people  of the confederacy were known as _Rotinonsionni_, \"They of the Extended  House.\" In the Seneca dialect this was altered and abridged to  Hotinonsonni, the n having the French nasal sound. This word is written  by Mr. Morgan, \"Hodenosaunee.\"]    The names of the six great chiefs who, as representatives of their  several nations, formed the confederacy, are in this narrative linked  together in a manner which declares their political kinship. The first  rulers or heads of the combined households were the Canienga Dekanawidah  with his \"joint-ruler\" and political son, the Oneida Otatsehte (or  Odadsheghte), whose union with Dekanawidah was the commencement of the  League. Next follows Otatsehte's uncle (and Dekanawidah's brother), the  Onondaga Wathadodarho (Atotarho), who is accompanied by his son, the  Cayuga Akahenyonh. The uncle of the Cayuga representative, the Seneca  chief Kanadariyu, and his cousin, Shadekaronyes, represent the two  sections into which the great Seneca nation was divided. The name of  Hiawatha does not appear in this enumeration. According to the uniform  tradition of the Five Nations, he was not merely present in the  convention, but was the leading spirit in its deliberations. But he did  not officially represent any nation. By birth a high chief of the  Onondagas, he had been but newly adopted among the Caniengas. Each of  these nations had entrusted its interests to its own most influential  chief. But the respect with which Hiawatha was regarded is indicated, as  has been already remarked, by his place in the list of fifty  councillors, with whose names the Book concludes. Though so recently  received among the haughty Caniengas, whose proud and jealous temper is  often noticed by the missionaries and other early observers, his name is  placed second in the list of their representatives, immediately  following that of Tekarihoken, the chief who stood highest in titular  rank among the nobles of the Kanonsionni, and whose lineage was perhaps  derived from the leader of their primitive migrations.    The tradition runs that when the political frame of their confederacy  had been arranged by the members of this convention, and the number of  senators who should represent each nation in the federal council had  been determined, the six delegates, with Hiawatha and some other  advisers, went through all the nations, selecting--doubtless with the  aid of a national council in each case--the chiefs who were to  constitute the first council. In designating these,--or rather,  probably, in the ceremonies of their installation,--it is said that some  peculiar prerogative was conceded to the Onondagas,--that is, to  Atotarho and his attendant chiefs. It was probably given as a"]]]
