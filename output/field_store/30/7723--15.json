Then the  light-maid bade her good night and opened the door.    When she closed it after her Betsy was in darkness. In six winks the  little girl was fast asleep.          Chapter Thirteen    The Jinjin's Just Judgment      All the adventurers were reunited next morning when they were brought  from various palaces to the Residence of Tititi-Hoochoo and ushered  into the great Hall of State.    As before, no one was visible except our friends and their escorts  until the first bell sounded. Then in a flash the room was seen to be  filled with the beautiful Kings and Queens of the land. The second bell  marked the appearance in the throne of the mighty Jinjin, whose  handsome countenance was as composed and expressionless as ever.    All bowed low to the Ruler. Their voices softly murmured: \"We greet the  Private Citizen, mightiest of Rulers, whose word is Law and whose Law  is just.\"    Tititi-Hoochoo bowed in acknowledgment. Then, looking around the  brilliant assemblage, and at the little group of adventurers before  him, he said:    \"An unusual thing has happened. Inhabitants of other lands than ours,  who are different from ourselves in many ways, have been thrust upon us  through the Forbidden Tube, which one of our people foolishly made  years ago and was properly punished for his folly. But these strangers  had no desire to come here and were wickedly thrust into the Tube by a  cruel King on the other side of the world, named Ruggedo. This King is  an immortal, but he is not good. His magic powers hurt mankind more  than they benefit them. Because he had unjustly kept the Shaggy Man's  brother a prisoner, this little band of honest people, consisting of  both mortals and immortals, determined to conquer Ruggedo and to punish  him. Fearing they might succeed in this, the Nome King misled them so  that they fell into the Tube.    \"Now, this same Ruggedo has been warned by me, many times, that if ever  he used this Forbidden Tube in any way he would be severely punished. I  find, by referring to the Fairy Records, that this King's servant, a  nome named Kaliko, begged his master not to do such a wrong act as to  drop these people into the Tube and send them tumbling into our  country. But Ruggedo defied me and my orders.    \"Therefore these strangers are innocent of any wrong. It is only  Ruggedo who deserves punishment, and I will punish him.\" He paused a  moment and then continued in the same cold, merciless voice:    \"These strangers must return through the Tube to their own side of the  world; but I will make their fall more easy and pleasant than it was  before. Also I shall send with them an Instrument of Vengeance, who in  my name will drive Ruggedo from his underground caverns, take away his  magic powers and make him a homeless wanderer on the face of the  earth--a place he detests.\"    There was a little murmur of horror from the Kings and Queens at the  severity of this punishment, but no one uttered a protest, for all  realized that the sentence was just.    \"In selecting my Instrument of Vengeance,\" went on Tititi-Hoochoo, \"I  have realized that this will be an unpleasant mission. Therefore no one  of us who is blameless should be forced to undertake it. In this  wonderful land it is seldom one is guilty of wrong, even in the  slightest degree, and on examining the Records I found no King or Queen  had erred. Nor had any among their followers or servants done any  wrong. But finally I came to the Dragon Family, which we highly  respect, and then it was that I discovered the error of Quox.    \"Quox, as you well know, is a young dragon who has not yet acquired the  wisdom of his race. Because of this lack, he has been disrespectful  toward his most ancient ancestor, the Original Dragon, telling him once  to mind his own business and again saying that the Ancient One had  grown foolish with age. We are aware that dragons are not the same as  fairies and cannot be altogether guided by our laws, yet such  disrespect as Quox has shown should not be unnoticed by us. Therefore I  have selected Quox as my royal Instrument of Vengeance and he shall go  through the Tube with these people and inflict upon Ruggedo the  punishment I have decreed.\"    All had listened quietly to this speech and now the Kings and Queens  bowed gravely to signify their approval of the Jinjin's judgment.    Tititi-Hoochoo turned to Tubekins.    \"I command you,\" said he, \"to escort these strangers to the Tube and  see that they all enter it.\"    The King of the Tube, who had first discovered our friends and brought  them to the Private Citizen, stepped forward and bowed. As he did so,  the Jinjin and all the Kings and Queens suddenly disappeared and only  Tubekins remained visible.    \"All right,\" said Betsy, with a sigh; \"I don't mind going back so  _very_ much, 'cause the Jinjin promised to make it easy for us.\"    Indeed, Queen Ann and her officers were the only ones who looked solemn  and seemed to fear the return journey. One thing that bothered Ann was  her failure to conquer this land of Tititi-Hoochoo. As they followed  their guide through the gardens to the mouth of the Tube she said to  Shaggy:    \"How can I conquer the world, if I go away and leave this rich country  unconquered?\"    \"You can't,\" he replied. \"Don't ask me why, please, for if you don't  know I can't inform you.\"    \"Why not?\" said Ann; but Shaggy paid no attention to the question.    This end of the Tube had a silver rim and around it was a gold railing  to which was attached a sign that read.      \"IF YOU ARE OUT, STAY THERE.    IF YOU ARE IN, DON'T COME OUT.\"      On a little silver plate just inside the Tube was engraved the words:        \"Burrowed and built by    Hiergargo the Magician,    In the Year of the World    1 9 6 2 5 4 7 8    For his own exclusive uses.\"      \"He was some builder, I must say,\" remarked Betsy, when she had read  the inscription; \"but if he had known about that star I guess he'd have  spent his time playing solitaire.\"    \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" inquired Shaggy, who was impatient to  start.    \"Quox,\" replied Tubekins. \"But I think I hear him coming.\"    \"Is the young dragon invisible?\" asked Ann, who had never seen a live  dragon and was a little fearful of meeting one.    \"No, indeed,\" replied the King of the Tube. \"You'll see him in a  minute; but before you part company I'm sure you'll wish he _was_  invisible.\"    \"Is he dangerous, then?\" questioned Files.    \"Not at all. But Quox tires me dreadfully,\" said Tubekins, \"and I  prefer his room to his company.\"    At that instant a scraping sound was heard, drawing nearer and nearer  until from between two big bushes appeared a huge dragon, who  approached the party, nodded his head and said: \"Good morning.\"    Had Quox been at all bashful I am sure he would have felt uncomfortable  at the astonished stare of every eye in the group--except Tubekins, of  course, who was not astonished because he had seen Quox so often.    Betsy had thought a \"young\" dragon must be a small dragon, yet here was  one so enormous that the girl decided he must be full grown, if not  overgrown. His body was a lovely sky-blue in color and it was thickly  set with glittering silver scales, each one as big as a serving-tray.  Around his neck was a pink ribbon with a bow just under his left ear,  and below the ribbon appeared a chain of pearls to which was attached a  golden locket about as large around as the end of a bass drum. This  locket was set with many large and beautiful jewels.    The head and face of Quox were not especially ugly, when you consider  that he was a dragon; but his eyes were so large that it took him a  long time to wink and his teeth seemed very sharp and terrible when  they showed, which they did whenever the beast smiled. Also his  nostrils were quite large and wide, and those who stood near him were  liable to smell brimstone--especially when he breathed out fire, as it  is the nature of dragons to do. To the end of his long tail was  attached a big electric light.    Perhaps the most singular thing about the dragon's appearance at this  time was the fact that he had a row of seats attached to his back, one  seat for each member of the party. These seats were double, with curved  backs, so that two could sit in them, and there were twelve of these  double seats, all strapped firmly around the dragon's thick body and  placed one behind the other, in a row that extended from his shoulders  nearly to his tail.    \"Aha!\" exclaimed Tubekins; \"I see that Tititi-Hoochoo has transformed  Quox into a carryall.\"    \"I'm glad of that,\" said Betsy. \"I hope, Mr. Dragon, you won't mind our  riding on your back.\"    \"Not a bit,\" replied Quox. \"I'm in disgrace just now, you know, and the  only way to redeem my good name is to obey the orders of the Jinjin. If  he makes me a beast of burden, it is only a part of my punishment, and  I must bear it like a dragon. I don't blame you people at all, and I  hope you'll enjoy the ride. Hop on, please. All aboard for the other  side of the world!\"    Silently they took their places. Hank sat in the front seat with Betsy,  so that he could rest his front hoofs upon the dragon's head. Behind  them were Shaggy and Polychrome, then Files and the Princess, and Queen  Ann and Tik-Tok. The officers rode in the rear seats. When all had  mounted to their places the dragon looked very like one of those  sightseeing wagons so common in big cities--only he had legs instead of  wheels.    \"All ready?\" asked Quox, and when they said they were he crawled to the  mouth of the Tube and put his head in.    \"Good-bye, and good luck to you!\" called Tubekins; but no one thought  to reply, because just then the dragon slid his great body into the  Tube and the journey to the other side of the world had begun.    At first they went so fast that they could scarcely catch"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#14)"],[1,"better, if you can find a way to do it,\" agreed Googly-Goo.  \"Everything would come right if you could kill Gloria's love for that  gardener's boy. Really, Sire, now that I come to think of it, there  must be fully a bushel and a half of those jewels!\"    Just then a messenger entered the court to say that the banquet was  prepared for the strangers. So Cap'n Bill, Trot and Button-Bright  entered the castle and were taken to a room where a fine feast was  spread upon the table.    \"I don't like that Lord Googly-Goo,\" remarked Trot as she was busily  eating.    \"Nor I,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"But from the talk we heard I guess the  gardener's boy won't get the Princess.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" returned the girl; \"but I hope old Googly doesn't get  her, either.\"    \"The King means to sell her for all those jewels,\" observed  Button-Bright, his mouth half full of cake and jam.    \"Poor Princess!\" sighed Trot. \"I'm sorry for her, although I've never  seen her. But if she says no to Googly-Goo, and means it, what can they  do?\"    \"Don't let us worry about a strange Princess,\" advised Cap'n Bill.  \"I've a notion we're not too safe, ourselves, with this cruel King.\"    The two children felt the same way and all three were rather solemn  during the remainder of the meal.    When they had eaten, the servants escorted them to their rooms. Cap'n  Bill's room was way to one end of the castle, very high up, and Trot's  room was at the opposite end, rather low down. As for Button-Bright,  they placed him in the middle, so that all were as far apart as they  could possibly be. They didn't like this arrangement very well, but all  the rooms were handsomely furnished and being guests of the King they  dared not complain.    After the strangers had left the courtyard the King and Googly-Goo had  a long talk together, and the King said:    \"I cannot force Gloria to marry you just now, because those strangers  may interfere. I suspect that the wooden-legged man possesses great  magical powers, or he would never have been able to carry himself and  those children across the deadly desert.\"    \"I don't like him; he looks dangerous,\" answered Googly-Goo. \"But  perhaps you are mistaken about his being a wizard. Why don't you test  his powers?\"    \"How?\" asked the King.    \"Send for the Wicked Witch. She will tell you in a moment whether that  wooden-legged person is a common man or a magician.\"    \"Ha! that's a good idea,\" cried the King. \"Why didn't I think of the  Wicked Witch before? But the woman demands rich rewards for her  services.\"    \"Never mind; I will pay her,\" promised the wealthy Googly-Goo.    So a servant was dispatched to summon the Wicked Witch, who lived but a  few leagues from King Krewl's castle. While they awaited her, the  withered old courtier proposed that they pay a visit to Princess Gloria  and see if she was not now in a more complaisant mood. So the two  started away together and searched the castle over without finding  Gloria.    At last Googly-Goo suggested she might be in the rear garden, which was  a large park filled with bushes and trees and surrounded by a high  wall. And what was their anger, when they turned a corner of the path,  to find in a quiet nook the beautiful Princess, and kneeling before  her, Pon, the gardener's boy! With a roar of rage the King dashed  forward; but Pon had scaled the wall by means of a ladder, which still  stood in its place, and when he saw the King coming he ran up the  ladder and made good his escape. But this left Gloria confronted by her  angry guardian, the King, and by old Googly-Goo, who was trembling with  a fury he could not express in words.    Seizing the Princess by her arm the King dragged her back to the  castle. Pushing her into a room on the lower floor he locked the door  upon the unhappy girl. And at that moment the arrival of the Wicked  Witch was announced.    Hearing this, the King smiled, as a tiger smiles, showing his teeth.  And Googly-Goo smiled, as a serpent smiles, for he had no teeth except  a couple of fangs. And having frightened each other with these smiles  the two dreadful men went away to the Royal Council Chamber to meet the  Wicked Witch.          Chapter Twelve    The Wooden-Legged Grass-Hopper      Now it so happened that Trot, from the window of her room, had  witnessed the meeting of the lovers in the garden and had seen the King  come and drag Gloria away. The little girl's heart went out in sympathy  for the poor Princess, who seemed to her to be one of the sweetest and  loveliest young ladies she had ever seen, so she crept along the  passages and from a hidden niche saw Gloria locked in her room.    The key was still in the lock, so when the King had gone away, followed  by Googly-Goo, Trot stole up to the door, turned the key and entered.  The Princess lay prone upon a couch, sobbing bitterly. Trot went up to  her and smoothed her hair and tried to comfort her.    \"Don't cry,\" she said. \"I've unlocked the door, so you can go away any  time you want to.\"    \"It isn't that,\" sobbed the Princess. \"I am unhappy because they will  not let me love Pon, the gardener's boy!\"    \"Well, never mind; Pon isn't any great shakes, anyhow, seems to me,\"  said Trot soothingly. \"There are lots of other people you can love.\"    Gloria rolled over on the couch and looked at the little girl  reproachfully.    \"Pon has won my heart, and I can't help loving him,\" she explained.  Then with sudden indignation she added: \"But I'll never love  Googly-Goo--never, as long as I live!\"    \"I should say not!\" replied Trot. \"Pon may not be much good, but old  Googly is very, very bad. Hunt around, and I'm sure you'll find someone  worth your love. You're very pretty, you know, and almost anyone ought  to love you.\"    \"You don't understand, my dear,\" said Gloria, as she wiped the tears  from her eyes with a dainty lace handkerchief bordered with pearls.  \"When you are older you will realize that a young lady cannot decide  whom she will love, or choose the most worthy. Her heart alone decides  for her, and whomsoever her heart selects, she must love, whether he  amounts to much or not.\"    Trot was a little puzzled by this speech, which seemed to her  unreasonable; but she made no reply and presently Gloria's grief  softened and she began to question the little girl about herself and  her adventures. Trot told her how they had happened to come to  Jinxland, and all about Cap'n Bill and the Ork and Pessim and the Bumpy  Man.    While they were thus conversing together, getting more and more  friendly as they became better acquainted, in the Council Chamber the  King and Googly-Goo were talking with the Wicked Witch.    This evil creature was old and ugly. She had lost one eye and wore a  black patch over it, so the people of Jinxland had named her \"Blinkie.\"  Of course witches are forbidden to exist in the Land of Oz, but  Jinxland was so far removed from the center of Ozma's dominions, and so  absolutely cut off from it by the steep mountains and the bottomless  gulf, that the laws of Oz were not obeyed very well in that country. So  there were several witches in Jinxland who were the terror of the  people, but King Krewl favored them and permitted them to exercise  their evil sorcery.    Blinkie was the leader of all the other witches and therefore the most  hated and feared. The King used her witchcraft at times to assist him  in carrying out his cruelties and revenge, but he was always obliged to  pay Blinkie large sums of money or heaps of precious jewels before she  would undertake an enchantment. This made him hate the old woman almost  as much as his subjects did, but to-day Lord Googly-Goo had agreed to  pay the witch's price, so the King greeted her with gracious favor.    \"Can you destroy the love of Princess Gloria for the gardener's boy?\"  inquired his Majesty.    The Wicked Witch thought about it before she replied:    \"That's a hard question to answer. I can do lots of clever magic, but  love is a stubborn thing to conquer. When you think you've killed it,  it's liable to bob up again as strong as ever. I believe love and cats  have nine lives. In other words, killing love is a hard job, even for a  skillful witch, but I believe I can do something that will answer your  purpose just as well.\"    \"What is that?\" asked the King.    \"I can freeze the girl's heart. I've got a special incantation for  that, and when Gloria's heart is thoroughly frozen she can no longer  love Pon.\"    \"Just the thing!\" exclaimed Googly-Goo, and the King was likewise much  pleased.    They bargained a long time as to the price, but finally the old  courtier agreed to pay the Wicked Witch's demands. It was arranged that  they should take Gloria to Blinkie's house the next day, to have her  heart frozen.    Then King Krewl mentioned to the old hag the strangers who had that day  arrived in Jinxland, and said to her:    \"I think the two children--the boy and the girl--are unable to harm me,  but I have a suspicion that the wooden-legged man is a powerful wizard.\"    The witch's face wore a troubled look when she heard this.    \"If you are right,\" she said, \"this wizard might spoil my incantation  and interfere with me in other ways. So it will be best for me to meet  this stranger at once and match my magic against his, to decide which  is the stronger.\"    \"All right,\" said the King. \"Come with me and I will lead you to the  man's room.\"    Googly-Goo did not accompany them, as he was obliged to go home to get  the money and jewels he had promised to pay old Blinkie, so the other  two climbed several flights of stairs and went through many passages  until they came to the room occupied by Cap'n Bill.    The sailor-man, finding his bed soft and inviting, and being tired with  the adventures he had experienced, had decided to take a nap. When the  Wicked Witch and the King softly opened his door and entered, Cap'n  Bill was snoring with such vigor that he did not hear them"]]]
