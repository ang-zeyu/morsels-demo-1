Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's             mandrakes.    01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast             taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's             mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with             thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.    01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went             out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for             surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay             with her that night.    01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob             the fifth son.    01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given             my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.    01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.    01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will             my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:             and she called his name Zebulun.    01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.    01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and             opened her womb.    01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken             away my reproach:    01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add             to me another son.    01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob             said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own             place, and to my country.    01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,             and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done             thee.    01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour             in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that             the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.    01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.    01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and             how thy cattle was with me.    01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is             now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee             since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own             house also?    01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou             shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for             me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.    01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence             all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle             among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:             and of such shall be my hire.    01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when             it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is             not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the             sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.    01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy             word.    01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and             spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,             and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown             among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.    01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and             Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.    01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and             chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the             white appear which was in the rods.    01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in             the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to             drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.    01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth             cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.    01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the             flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock             of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put             them not unto Laban's cattle.    01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did             conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the             cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the             rods.    01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the             feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.    01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and             maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.    01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath             taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was             our father's hath he gotten all this glory.    01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was             not toward him as before.    01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy             fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.    01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto             his flock,    01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it             is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been             with me.    01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.    01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten             times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.    01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the             cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked             shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.    01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given             them to me.    01:031:010 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#14)"],[1,"of the seventh month, when ye have             gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto             the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and             on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.    03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly             trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,             and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD             your God seven days.    03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the             year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye             shall celebrate it in the seventh month.    03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites             born shall dwell in booths:    03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of             Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land             of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.    03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of             the LORD.    03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure             oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn             continually.    03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the             congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the             morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for             ever in your generations.    03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the             LORD continually.    03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:             two tenth deals shall be in one cake.    03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the             pure table before the LORD.    03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it             may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by             fire unto the LORD.    03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD             continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an             everlasting covenant.    03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it             in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the             offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.    03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an             Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son             of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together             in the camp;    03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the             Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his             mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the             tribe of Dan:)    03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be             shewed them.    03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all             that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the             congregation stone him.    03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,             Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.    03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely             be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly             stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the             land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put             to death.    03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.    03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for             beast.    03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath             done, so shall it be done to him;    03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath             caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.    03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that             killeth a man, he shall be put to death.    03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as             for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.    03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should             bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him             with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD             commanded Moses.    03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,    03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye             come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep             a sabbath unto the LORD.    03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt             prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;    03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the             land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy             field, nor prune thy vineyard.    03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt             not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for             it is a year of rest unto the land.    03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,             and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired             servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.    03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,             shall all the increase thereof be meat.    03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven             times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of             years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.    03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on             the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement             shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.    03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty             throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it             shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto             his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.    03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not             sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor             gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.    03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat             the increase thereof out of the field.    03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his             possession.    03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of             thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:    03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt             buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years             of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:    03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the             price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou             shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of             the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.    03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt             fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.    03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and             do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.    03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your             fill, and dwell therein in safety.    03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?             behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:    03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,             and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.    03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit             until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of             the old store.    03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for             ye are strangers and sojourners with me.    03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a             redemption for the land.    03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his             possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then             shall he redeem that which his brother sold.    03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to             redeem it;    03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore             the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may             return unto his possession.    03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is             sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until             the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he             shall return unto his possession.    03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he             may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a             full year may he redeem it.    03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,             then the house that is in the walled city shall be established             for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it             shall not go out in the jubile.    03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about             them shall be counted as"]]]
