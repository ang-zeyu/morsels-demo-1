He could  urge on Gattinara that it would be wise to agree to a truce till that  period was reached; then all would be straightforward. So Wolsey  adjourned the public sittings of the conference, and negotiated  privately with the two parties. The French saw in a year's truce only a  means of allowing the Emperor to prepare for war, and demanded a  substantial truce for ten years. Wolsey used all his skill to bring  about an agreement, and induced Gattinara to accept a truce for eighteen  months, and the French to reduce their demands to four years. But  Charles raised a new difficulty, and claimed that all conquests made in  the war should be given up. The only conquest was Fontarabia, on the  border of Navarre, which was still occupied by the French. Francis not  unnaturally declined to part with it solely to obtain a brief truce, as  Charles had no equivalent to restore. Wolsey used every argument to  induce the Emperor to withdraw his claim; but he was obstinate, and the  conference came to an end. It is true that Wolsey tried to keep up  appearances by concluding a truce for a month, that the Emperor might go  to Spain and consult his subjects about the surrender of Fontarabia.    So Wolsey departed from Calais on 25th November, disappointed and worn  out. As he wrote himself, \"I have been so sore tempested in mind by the  untowardness of the chancellors and orators on every side, putting so  many difficulties and obstacles to condescend to any reasonable  conditions of truce and abstinence of war, that night nor day I could  have no quietness nor rest.\" There is no doubt that Wolsey wrote what he  felt. He had laboured hard for peace, and had failed. If he hoped that  the labours of the conference might still be continued by his diplomacy  in England, that hope was destroyed before he reached London. On 1st  December the imperial troops captured Tournai, which they had been for  some time besieging, and news came from Italy that Milan also had fallen  before the forces of the Emperor and the Pope. Charles had seemed to  Wolsey unreasonable in his obstinacy. He had refused a truce which he  had every motive of prudence for welcoming; and now events proved that  he was justified. Not only had Francis been foiled in his attempts to  embarrass his rival, but success had followed the first steps which  Charles had taken to retaliate. The time for diplomacy was past, and the  quarrel must be decided by the sword.    So Wolsey saw his great designs overthrown. He was a peace minister  because he knew that England had nothing to gain from war. He had  striven to keep the peace of Europe by means of England's mediation, and  his efforts had been so far successful as to give England the first  place in the counsels of Europe. But Wolsey hoped more from diplomacy  than diplomacy could do. Advice and influence can do something to check  the outbreak of war when war is not very seriously designed; but in  proportion as great interests are concerned, attempts at mediation are  useless unless they are backed by force. England was not prepared for  war, and had no troops by whom she could pretend to enforce her  counsels. When the two rival powers began to be in earnest, they  admitted England's mediation only as a means of involving her in their  quarrel. Wolsey was only the first of a long series of English ministers  who have met with the same disappointment from the same reason. England  in Wolsey's days had the same sort of interest in the affairs of the  Continent as she has had ever since. Wolsey first taught her to develop  that interest by pacific counsels, and so long as that has been  possible, England has been powerful. But when a crisis comes England has  ever been slow to recognise its inevitableness; and her habit of hoping  against hope for peace has placed her in an undignified attitude for a  time, has drawn upon her reproaches for duplicity, and has involved her  in war against her will.    This was now the net result of Wolsey's endeavours, a result which he  clearly perceived. His efforts of mediation at Calais had been  entirely his own, and he could confide to no one his regret and his  disappointment. Henry was resolved on war when Wolsey first set forth,  and if Wolsey had succeeded in making a truce, the credit would have  been entirely his own. He allowed Henry to think that the conference at  Calais was merely a pretext to gain time for military preparations; if a  truce had been made he would have put it down to the force of  circumstances; as his efforts for a truce had failed, he could take  credit that he had done all in his power to establish the king's  reputation throughout Christendom, and had fixed the blame on those who  would not follow his advice. It is a mark of Wolsey's conspicuous skill  that he never forgot his actual position, and never was so entirely  absorbed in his own plans as not to leave himself a ready means for  retreat. His schemes had failed; but he could still take credit for  having furthered other ends which were contrary to his own. Henry was  well contented with the results of Wolsey's mission, and showed his  satisfaction in the customary way of increasing Wolsey's revenues at the  expense of the Church. The death was announced of the Abbot of St.  Alban's, and the king, in answer to Wolsey's request, ordered the monks  to take Wolsey for their abbot, saying, \"My lord cardinal has sustained  many charges in this his voyage, and hath expended £10,000.\" So kings  were served, and so they recompensed their servants.           CHAPTER VI   THE IMPERIAL ALLIANCE   1521-1523      The failure of Wolsey's plans was due to the diplomacy of Gattinara and  to the obstinacy of Charles V., who showed at the end of the  negotiations at Calais an unexpected readiness to appreciate his  obligations towards his dominions as a whole, by refusing to abandon  Fontarabia lest thereby he should irritate his Spanish subjects. It was  this capacity for large consideration that gave Charles V. his power in  the future; his motives were hard to discover, but they always rested on  a view of his entire obligations, and were dictated by reasons known  only to himself. Even Wolsey did not understand the Emperor's motives,  which seemed to him entirely foolish. He allowed himself to take up a  haughty position, which deeply offended Charles, who exclaimed angrily,  \"This cardinal will do everything his own way, and treats me as though I  were a prisoner.\" Charles treasured up his resentment, of which Wolsey  was entirely unconscious, and was determined not to allow so masterful a  spirit to become more powerful.    He soon had an opportunity of acting on this determination, as the  unexpected death of Pope Leo X. on 1st December naturally awakened hopes  in Wolsey's breast. It was impossible that the foremost statesman in  Europe should not have had the legitimate aspiration of reaching the  highest office to which he could attain. But though Wolsey was ready  when the opportunity came to press his own claims with vigour, it cannot  be said with fairness that his previous policy had been in any way  directed to that end, or that he had swerved in the least from his own  path to further his chances for the papal office. Indeed he had no  reason for so doing, as Leo was only forty-six years old when he died,  and his death was entirely unforeseen. Moreover, we know that when the  Spanish envoys offered Wolsey the Emperor's help towards the Papacy in  1520, Wolsey refused the offer; since then Charles at Bruges had  repeated the offer without being asked. Now that a vacancy had arisen,  it was natural for Wolsey to attach some weight to this promise, and  Henry expressed himself warmly in favour of Wolsey's election, and urged  his imperial ally to work by all means for that end. He sent to Rome his  favourite secretary Pace to further it by pressing representations to  the cardinals.    It does not seem that Wolsey was very sanguine in his expectations of  being elected. Leo X. had died at a moment of great importance for  Charles V.; in fact his death had been brought about by the imprudence  which he showed in manifesting his delight at the success of the  imperial arms against Milan, and his prospect of the overthrow of  France. It was necessary for Charles that a Pope should be elected who  would hold to Leo's policy, and would continue the alliance with  England. The man who held in his hand the threads of Leo X.'s numerous  intrigues was his cousin, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and Wolsey  admitted the advantages to be gained by his election. Wolsey at once  declared that he submitted his candidature to the decision of Henry  VIII. and the Emperor; if they thought that he was the best person to  promote their interests he would not shrink from the labour; but he  agreed that if his candidature were not likely to be acceptable to the  cardinals, the two monarchs should unite in favour of Cardinal Medici.  Charles's ambassador wrote him that it would be well to act carefully,  as Wolsey was watching to see how much faith he could put in the  Emperor's protestations of goodwill.    So Charles was prepared, and acted with ambiguous caution. He put off  communicating with Henry as long as he could; he regretted that he was  in the Netherlands instead of Germany, whence he could have made his  influence felt in Rome; he secretly ordered his ambassador in Rome to  press for the election of Cardinal Medici, but gave him no definite  instructions about any one else; finally he wrote a warm letter in  favour of Wolsey, which he either never sent at all, or sent too late to  be of any use, but which served as an enclosure to satisfy Henry VIII.  Wolsey was not deceived by this, and knew how papal elections might be  influenced."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#14)"],[1,"\"    \"There is Mr. Vance now,\" said Mrs. Colfax, and added fervently, \"Thank  the Lord!\"          CHAPTER IX. A QUIET SUNDAY IN LOCUST STREET    IF the truth were known where Virginia got the opinions which she  expressed so freely to her aunt and cousin, it was from Colonel Carvel  himself. The Colonel would rather have denounced the Dred Scott decision  than admit to Judge Whipple that one of the greatest weaknesses of the  South lay in her lack of mechanical and manufacturing ability. But he  had confessed as much in private to Captain Elijah Brent. The Colonel  would often sit for an hour or more, after supper, with his feet tucked  up on the mantel and his hat on the back of his head, buried in thought.  Then he would saunter slowly down to the Planters' House bar, which  served the purposes of a club in those days, in search of an argument  with other prominent citizens. The Colonel had his own particular chair  in his own particular corner, which was always vacated when he came in  at the door. And then he always had three fingers of the best Bourbon  whiskey, no more and no less, every evening.    He never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the Planters'  House bar. Judge Whipple, indeed, took his meals upstairs, but he never  descended,--it was generally supposed because of the strong slavery  atmosphere there. However, the Judge went periodically to his friend's  for a quiet Sunday dinner (so called in derision by St. Louisans), on  which occasions Virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to  pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely.    The Sunday following her ride to Bellegarde was the Judge's Sunday,  Certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with  pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress. More than  once had she scored a fair hit on the Judge for her father,--to the  mutual delight of both gentlemen. But to-day she dreaded being present  at the argument. Just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine  psychology best left to the reader for solution.    The argument began, as usual, with the tearing apart limb by limb of the  unfortunate Franklin Pierce, by Judge Whipple.    \"What a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world,\" said the  Judge. \"Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire\" (he pronounced this name with  infinite scorn) \"managed by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi!\"    \"And he was well managed, sir,\" said the Colonel.    \"What a pliant tool of your Southern slaveholders! I hear that you are  to give him a plantation as a reward.\"    \"No such thing, sir.\"    \"He deserves it,\" continued the Judge, with conviction. \"See the  magnificent forts he permitted Davis to build up in the South, the  arsenals he let him stock. The country does not realize this. But the  day will, come when they will execrate Pierce before Benedict Arnold,  sir. And look at the infamous Kansas-Nebraska act! That is the greatest  crime, and Douglas and Pierce the greatest criminals, of the century.\"    \"Do have some more of that fried chicken, Judge,\" said Virginia.    Mr. Whipple helped himself fiercely, and the Colonel smiled.    \"You should be satisfied now,\" said he. \"Another Northern man is in the  White House.\"    \"Buchanan!\" roared the Judge, with his mouth full.    \"Another traitor, sir. Another traitor worse than the first. He swallows  the Dred Scott decision, and smirks. What a blot on the history of this  Republic! O Lord!\" cried Mr. Whipple, \"what are we coming to? A Northern  man, he could gag and bind Kansas and force her into slavery against the  will of her citizens. He packs his Cabinet to support the ruffians  you send over the borders. The very governors he ships out there, his  henchmen, have their stomachs turned. Look at Walker, whom they are  plotting against in Washington. He can't stand the smell of this  Lecompton Constitution Buchanan is trying to jam down their throats.  Jefferson Davis would have troops there, to be sure that it goes  through, if he had his way. Can't you see how one sin leads to another,  Carvel? How slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people?\"    \"It is because you won't let it alone where it belongs, sir,\" retorted  the Colonel. It was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies. He  talked slowly, and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent  the more eager Judge from interrupting him.    \"The welfare of the whole South, as matters now stand, sir, depends upon  slavery. Our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor. If  you abolished that institution, Judge Whipple, you would ruin millions  of your fellow-countrymen,--you would reduce sovereign states to a  situation of disgraceful dependence. And all, sir,\" now he raised his  voice lest the Judge break in, \"all, sir, for the sake of a low breed  that ain't fit for freedom. You and I, who have the Magna Charta and  the Declaration of Independence behind us, who are descended from a  race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more, may well  establish a Republic where the basis of stability is the self-control of  the individual--as long as men such as you and I form its citizens. Look  at the South Americans. How do Republics go there? And the minute you  and I let in niggers, who haven't any more self-control than dogs, on  an equal basis, with as much of a vote as you have,--niggers, sir, that  have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days  of Ham,--what's going to become of our Republic?\"    \"Education,\" cried the Judge.    But the word was snatched out of his mouth.    \"Education isn't a matter of one generation. No, sir, nor two, nor  three, nor four. But of centuries.\"    \"Sir,\" said the Judge, \"I can point out negroes of intelligence and  learning.\"    \"And I reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk English, and recite  the catechism, and sing emotional hymns, if you brought over a couple of  million from Africa,\" answered the Colonel, dryly, as he rose to put on  his hat and light a cigar.    It was his custom to offer a cigar to the Judge, who invariably refused,  and rubbed his nose with scornful violence.    Virginia, on the verge of leaving, stayed on, fascinated by the turn the  argument had taken.    \"Your prejudice is hide-bound, sir,\" said Mr. Whipple.    \"No, Whipple,\" said the Colonel, \"when God washed off this wicked  earth, and started new, He saw fit to put the sons of Ham in subjection.  They're slaves of each other in Africa, and I reckon they're treated no  better than they are here. Abuses can't be helped in any system, sir,  though we are bettering them. Were the poor in London in the days of the  Edwards as well off as our niggers are to-day?\"    The Judge snorted.    \"A divine institution!\" he shouted. \"A black curse! Because the world  has been a wicked place of oppression since Noah's day, is that any  reason why it should so continue until the day of Judgment?\"    The Colonel smiled, which was a sign that he was pleased with his  argument.    \"Now, see here, Whipple,\" said he. \"If we had any guarantee that you  would let us alone where we are, to manage our slaves and to cultivate  our plantations, there wouldn't be any trouble. But the country keeps  on growing and growing, and you're not content with half. You want  everything,--all the new states must abolish slavery. And after a while  you will overwhelm us, and ruin us, and make us paupers. Do you wonder  that we contend for our rights, tooth and nail? They are our rights.\"    \"If it had not been for Virginia and Maryland and the South, this nation  would not be in existence.\"    The Colonel laughed.    \"First rate, Jinny,\" he cried. \"That's so.\"    But the Judge was in a revery. He probably had not heard her.    \"The nation is going to the dogs,\" he said, mumbling rather to himself  than to the others. \"We shall never prosper until the curse is shaken  off, or wiped out in blood. It clogs our progress. Our merchant marine,  of which we were so proud, has been annihilated by these continued  disturbances. But, sir,\" he cried, hammering his fist upon the table  until the glasses rang, \"the party that is to save us was born at  Pittsburgh last year on Washington's birthday. The Republican Party,  sir.\"    \"Shucks!\" exclaimed Mr. Carvel, with amusement, \"The Black Republican  Party, made up of old fools and young Anarchists, of Dutchmen and  nigger-worshippers. Why, Whipple, that party's a joke. Where's your  leader?\"    \"In Illinois,\" was the quick response.    \"What's his name?\"    \"Abraham Lincoln, sir,\" thundered Mr. Whipple. \"And to my way of  thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than  any of your Washington statesmen. 'This government,' said he to a friend  of mine, 'cannot exist half slave and half free.'\"    So impressively did Mr. Whipple pronounce these words that Mr. Carvel  stirred uneasily, and in spite of himself, as though he were listening  to an oracle. He recovered instantly.    \"He's a demagogue, seeking for striking phrases, sir. You're too  intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he.\"    \"I tell you he is not, sir.\"    \"I know him, sir,\" cried the Colonel, taking down his feet. \"He's  an obscure lawyer. Poor white trash! Torn down poor! My friend Mr.  Richardson of Springfield tells me he is low down. He was born in a log  cabin, and spends most of his time in a drug-store telling stories that  you would not listen to, Judge Whipple.\"    \"I would listen to anything he said,\" replied the Judge. \"Poor white  trash, sir! The greatest men rise from the people. A demagogue!\" Mr.  Whipple fairly shook with rage. \"The nation doesn't know him yet. But  mark my words, the day will come when it will. He was ballotted for  Vice-President in the Philadelphia convention last year. Nobody paid any  attention to that. If the convention had heard him speak at Bloomington,  he would have been nominated instead of Fremont. If the nation could  have heard "]]]
