Why didn't you call me?\"    \"It is important that we should not be recognized,\" said his mother.  \"While we stay here we must be exceedingly prudent. Suppose he had  called upon us at the hotel and fallen in with Mr. Granville. He might  have told him that you are my son, and that your name is Jonas, not  Philip.\"    \"Then the fat would be in the fire!\" said Jonas.    \"Exactly so; I am glad you see the danger. Now I want you to stay here,  or in your own room, for the next two or three hours.\"    \"It'll be awfully tiresome,\" grumbled Jonas.    \"It is necessary,\" said his mother firmly. \"Mr. Pearson leaves for New  York by an afternoon train. It is now only two o'clock. He left the  car at Thirteenth Street, and might easily call at this hotel. It is a  general rendezvous for visitors to the city. If he should meet you down  stairs, he would probably know you, and his curiosity would be aroused.  He asked me where I was staying, but I didn't appear to hear the  question.\"    \"That's pretty hard on me, ma.\"    \"I am out of all patience with you,\" said Mrs. Brent. \"Am I not working  for your interest, and you are doing all you can to thwart my plans. If  you don't care anything about inheriting a large fortune, let it go! We  can go back to Gresham and give it all up.\"    \"I'll do as you say, ma,\" said Jonas, subdued.    The very next day Mr. Granville sent for Mrs. Brent. She lost no time in  waiting upon him.    \"Mrs. Brent,\" he said, \"I have decided to leave Philadelphia to-morrow.\"    \"Are you quite able, sir?\" she asked, with a good assumption of  sympathy.    \"My doctor tells me I may venture. We shall travel in Pullman cars,  you know. I shall secure a whole compartment, and avail myself of every  comfort and luxury which money can command.\"    \"Ah, sir! money is a good friend in such a case.\"    \"True, Mrs. Brent. I have seen the time when I was poorly supplied with  it. Now I am happily at ease. Can you and Philip be ready?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Granville,\" answered Mrs. Brent promptly. \"We are ready  to-day, for that matter. We shall both be glad to get started.\"    \"I am glad to hear it. I think Philip will like his Western home.  I bought a fine country estate of a Chicago merchant, whose failure  compelled him to part with it. Philip shall have his own horse and his  own servants.\"    \"He will be delighted,\" said Mrs. Brent warmly. \"He has been used to  none of these things, for Mr. Brent and I, much as we loved him, had not  the means to provide him with such luxuries.\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Brent, I understand that fully. You were far from rich. Yet  you cared for my boy as if he were your own.\"    \"I loved him as much as if he had been my own son, Mr. Granville.\"    \"I am sure you did. I thank Providence that I am able to repay to some  extent the great debt I have incurred. I cannot repay it wholly, but  I will take care that you, too, shall enjoy ease and luxury. You shall  have one of the best rooms in my house, and a special servant to wait  upon you.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Granville,\" said Mrs. Brent, her heart filled with proud  anticipations of the state in which she should hereafter live. \"I do not  care where you put me, so long as you do not separate me from Philip.\"    \"She certainly loves my son!\" said Mr. Granville to himself. \"Yet her  ordinary manner is cold and constrained, and she does not seem like a  woman whose affections would easily be taken captive. Yet Philip seems  to have found the way to her heart. It must be because she has had so  much care of him. We are apt to love those whom we benefit.\"    But though Mr. Granville credited Mrs. Brent with an affection for  Philip, he was uneasily conscious that the boy's return had not brought  him the satisfaction and happiness he had fondly anticipated.    To begin with, Philip did not look at all as he had supposed his son  would look. He did not look like the Granvilles at all. Indeed, he had  an unusually countrified aspect, and his conversation was mingled with  rustic phrases which shocked his father's taste.    \"I suppose it comes of the way in which he has been brought up and  the country boys he has associated with,\" thought Mr. Granville.  \"Fortunately he is young, and there is time to polish him. As soon as I  reach Chicago I will engage a private tutor for him, who shall not only  remedy his defects of education, but do what he can to improve my son's  manners. I want him to grow up a gentleman.\"    The next day the three started for Chicago, while Mr. Granville's real  son and heir continued to live at a cheap lodging-house in New York.    The star of Jonas was in the ascendant, while poor Philip seemed  destined to years of poverty and hard work. Even now, he was threatened  by serious misfortune.        CHAPTER XX.    LEFT OUT IN THE COLD.    Of course Phil was utterly ignorant of the audacious attempt to deprive  him of his rights and keep him apart from the father who longed once  more to meet him. There was nothing before him so far as he knew except  to continue the up-hill struggle for a living.    He gave very little thought to the prediction of the fortune-teller whom  he had consulted, and didn't dream of any short-cut to fortune.    Do all he could, he found he could not live on his wages.    His board cost him four dollars a week, and washing and lunch two  dollars more, thus compelling him to exceed his salary by a dollar each  week.    He had, as we know, a reserve fund, on which he could draw, but it  was small, and grew constantly smaller. Then, again, his clothes were  wearing out, and he saw no way of obtaining money to buy new.    Phil became uneasy, and the question came up to his mind, \"Should he  write to his step-mother and ask her for a trifling loan?\" If the money  had been hers, he would not have done so on any condition; but she had  had nothing of her own, and all the property in her hands came through  Mr. Brent, who, as he knew, was attached to him, even though no tie of  blood united them. He certainly meant that Phil should be cared for out  of the estate, and at length Phil brought himself to write the following  letter:    \"NEW YORK, March 10, 18--.    \"DEAR MRS. BRENT: I suppose I ought to have written you before, and  have no good excuse to offer. I hope you and Jonas are well, and will  continue so. Let me tell you how I have succeeded thus far.    \"I have been fortunate enough to obtain a place in a large mercantile  establishment, and for my services I am paid five dollars a week. This  is more than boys generally get in the first place, and I am indebted to  the partiality of an old gentleman, the senior member of the firm, whom  I had the chance to oblige, for faring so well. Still I find it hard to  get along on this sum, though I am as economical as possible. My board  and washing cost me six dollars a week, and I have, besides, to buy  clothing from time to time. I have nearly spent the extra money I had  with me, and do not know how to keep myself looking respectable in the  way of clothing. Under the circumstances, I shall have to apply to you  for a loan, say of twenty-five dollars. In a year or two I hope to earn  enough to be entirely independent. At present I cannot expect it. As my  father--Mr. Brent--undoubtedly intended to provide for me, I don't think  I need to apologize for making this request. Still I do it reluctantly,  for I would prefer to depend entirely upon myself.    \"With regards to you and Jonas, I am yours truly, PHILIP BRENT.\"        Phil put this letter in the post-office, and patiently waited for an  answer.    \"Mrs. Brent surely cannot refuse me,\" he said to himself, \"since I have  almost wholly relieved her of the expense of taking care of me.\"    Phil felt so sure that money would be sent to him that he began to look  round a little among ready-made clothing stores to see at what price he  could obtain a suit that would do for every-day use. He found a store  in the Bowery where he could secure a suit, which looked as if it would  answer, for thirteen dollars. If Mrs. Brent sent him twenty-five, that  would leave him twelve for underclothing, and for a reserve fund to meet  the weekly deficit which he could not avoid.    Three--four days passed, and no letter came in answer to his.    \"It can't be that Mrs. Brent won't at least answer my letter,\" he  thought uneasily. \"Even if she didn't send me twenty-five dollars, she  couldn't help sending me something.\"    Still he felt uneasy, in view of the position in which he would find  himself in case no letter or remittance should come at all.    It was during this period of anxiety that his heart leaped for joy  when on Broadway he saw the familiar form of Reuben Gordon, a young man  already mentioned, to whom Phil had sold his gun before leaving Gresham.    \"Why, Reuben, how are you?\" exclaimed Phil joyfully. \"When did you come  to town?\"    \"Phil Brent!\" exclaimed Reuben, shaking hands heartily. \"I'm thunderin'  glad to see you. I was thinkin' of you only five minutes ago, and  wonderin' where you hung out.\"    \"But you haven't told me when you came to New York.\"    \"Only this morning! I'm goin' to stay with a cousin of my father's, that  lives in Brooklyn, over night.\"    \"I wanted to ask you about Mrs. Brent and Jonas. I was afraid they might  be sick, for I wrote four days ago and haven't got any answer yet.\"    \"Where did you write to?\"    \"To Gresham, of course,\" answered Phil, in surprise.    \"You don't mean to say you hain't heard of their leavin' Gresham?\" said  Reuben, in evident astonishment.    \"Who has left Gresham?\"    \"Your mother--leastwise, Mrs. Brent--and Jonas. They cleared out three  weeks ago, and nobody's heard a word of them since--that is, nobody in  the village.\"    \"Don't you know where they've gone?\" asked Phil, in amazement.    \"No. I was goin' to ask you. I s'posed, of course, they'd write and let  you know.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#14)"],[1,"of universal love.\" If the intermittent  peace accorded to the church in the first three troubled centuries of  its existence was productive of the evils admitted by the writers who  have felt that the cause of religion demanded that these evils as much  as possible should be covered up, naturally enough one exclaims, what  then must have been the result of that repose which came to the church  after the elevation of Constantine to the imperial throne! When from  a proscribed religion Christianity was exalted to the dignity of the  state religion of the empire; and her prelates and clergy, recalled  from exile and suffering, poverty and disgrace, were loaded with the  wealth and the honors that the lords of the Roman world could bestow!  Let imagination do her best or worst in picturing the rapid decline of  whatever remained of true Christianity, conjecture can scarcely outrun  the facts. If when the office of bishop was attended with danger and  scant revenues it aroused the inordinate ambition of men to possess it,  how infinitely more must it have become the object of envy, strife and  ambition when by the patronage of Constantine it became not only free  from danger but endowed with revenues that a prince might envy, and  accorded an influence in the palace scarcely second to that granted to  the governors of the provinces!    If before the Decian persecution the rivarly between the bishops of  Rome and Carthage prompted a bitter controversy which threatened the  unity of the church, how much more likely were such conflicts to arise  between the bishops of Rome and Constantinople--rival bishops of rival  cities, Rome proud of her past, Constantinople vain of her present  glory; the former jealous of the place she had filled in the world's  history; the latter ambitious of future influence! If heresies were  fomented and schisms created when to be a Christian invited espionage  and perhaps death, what an increase there must have been in these and  other disintegrating influences when it became a reproach rather than  a praise _not_ to be a Christian, and the door of the church stood  wide open to the evil-minded, who sought membership, not to enjoy the  consolation of religion but for worldly advantage!    Footnotes    1. Church History, Vol. i, Introduction. In justification of his  course, in a foot note he argues that \"A history of the perversions and  abuses of religion is not properly a history of the church; as absurd  were it to suppose a history of the highwaymen that have infested their  country to be a history of England.\" He appears oblivious to the fact  that he throws himself open to the retort: A history of the blessedness  and charity of the purely good men alone is not properly a history of  the church; as absurd were it to suppose a history alone of the honest  men of England that have blessed their race to be a history of that  country. Milner's work is more properly a history of piety than of the  church. In every age and country he seeks out the good men who have  nearest conformed their lives to Christian precepts and celebrates them  in his pages. Therefore, whatever admissions we find this author making  as to the corruptions and abuses which found their way into the church:  we shall be justified in considering as of special weight since they  are admitted by him only on compulsion, and when there is no chance of  either denying or excusing them. I have already called attention to the  same disposition in Eusebius, p. 37; and hence his testimony may also  be regarded as of special value in relation to the decline of the true  Christian spirit.    2.

CHANGES IN THE FORM AND SPIRIT OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT--CORRUPTION OF THE  POPES.    It is now my purpose to notice those alterations actually made in  the form and spirit of the Christian church government. Necessarily  my reference to these matters must be brief; sufficient only to  demonstrate the fact for which I am contending in these chapters.    I am forced to admit that the description of the church organization in  the New Testament is not all one could wish it to be. Only the faintest  outline may be traced in those documents which all Christians accept as  authority, and as they are fragmentary the description of the church  contained in them is necessarily imperfect.    From what is written it appears that the quorum of the Twelve Apostles  exercised a universal jurisdiction over the church, and a sort of  primacy seems to be accorded to three of their number, Peter, James and  John. Before the crucifixion Jesus also called into existence quorums  of seventies to whom he gave similar powers to those bestowed upon the  Twelve; [1] but for some reason, doubtless the imperfection of the  Christian records, we can learn nothing more of them than is set down  in the tenth chapter of Luke.    After the departure of the resurrected Messiah from his disciples  at Bethany, the apostles, as fast as men were brought to faith and  repentance through their preaching, organized in the various cities  where they labored branches of the church, over which they appointed  elders or bishops to preside; [2] and these evidently were assisted in  their duties by deacons. [3] In an enumeration of the church officers  given by Paul, we have other officers named besides apostles, prophets,  seventies; _viz.,_ evangelists, pastors and teachers. [4]    It is difficult from the New Testament to determine the exact nature  and full extent of the duties of these respective officers in the  church, or their gradation. But that there was a prescribed duty  to each officer, a limit to the authority of each, and a gradation  among them, which made a harmonious whole--a complete ecclesiastical  government, with all the parts properly adjusted and assigned their  respective duties, there can be no question. For Paul likens the church  of Christ to the body of a man, which, though it hath many members,  yet is it one body; and all the members are necessary; one cannot say  to the other, \"I have no need of thee.\" So all these officers in the  church, the apostle argues, are necessary; and as the head in the  natural body cannot say to the foot, \"I have no need of thee,\" neither  in the church can the apostle say to the deacon, \"I have no need of  thee;\" much less can the deacon say to the apostle, \"I have no need of  thee.\" [5] \"Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers?\" he  asks. The implied answer is, No; but, as he elsewhere says, the whole  body--i. e., the church--\"is fitly joined together, and compacted by  that which every joint supplieth.\" [6]    This organization as given by the Master had for its purpose the  perfecting of the saints; the work of the ministry; edifying the body  of Christ; and to prevent the saints being carried about by every wind  of doctrine, by the sleight and cunning of men. [7] The apostle who  thus specifies the purposes of the church organization also intimates  that it was to be perpetuated until the saints all come to the \"unity  of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God--unto a perfect  man, unto the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ.\" [8]  Furthermore, it is obvious that since the church organization was  given for the purposes above enumerated, so long as there are saints  to be perfected, or a necessity for work in the ministry; so long as  the church needs edifying or the saints guarding from heresy, and the  deceitfulness of false teachers--just so long will this organization of  the church with apostles and prophets, seventies and elders, bishops  and pastors, teachers and deacons be needed; and since the kinds of  work enumerated in the foregoing will always be necessary, we arrive  at the conclusion that the church organization as established by  the apostles was designed to be perpetual. [9] But that it was not  perpetuated is clearly demonstrated by writers of the second century,  who, with the single exception of Clement of Alexandria, who calls  Clement of Rome an \"Apostle,\" recognize no other officers in the  church than bishops, presbyters (elders) and deacons. It is difficult  to account for the sudden loss of so many orders of officers in the  church, unless, indeed, the apostasy for which I contend had made very  great progress as early as the opening of the second century, which, I  believe, was the case.    It appears from a statement of Clement of Rome [10] that persons  selected by the apostles to be bishops, and after the death of the  apostles those selected by other men of repute in the church, were  submitted to the people for their approval, and this was the custom  until the fourth century. It was also the custom of the bishops to  employ the elders as a sort of council; and to call upon the people for  their assent in the important matters of church government. In course  of time, however, early in the fourth century, this respect for the  principle of common consent was lost. The people were first altogether  excluded from a voice in ecclesiastical affairs; and the next step was  to deprive the elders of their former authority. [11] Thus power was  centralized in the hands of the bishops, which enabled them to control  everything at their discretion, and paved the way for those abuses of  power which bear evidence of the awful apostasy of the church.    So far as can be learned from the Christian annals, the churches that  "]]]
