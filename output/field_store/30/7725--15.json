Three other additions to the rescue party were made the next morning,  just as they were setting out upon their journey. The first was a  little boy called Button Bright, because he had no other name that  anyone could remember. He was a fine, manly little fellow, well  mannered and good humored, who had only one bad fault. He was  continually getting lost. To be sure, Button Bright got found as often  as he got lost, but when he was missing his friends could not help  being anxious about him.    \"Some day,\" predicted the Patchwork Girl, \"he won't be found, and that  will be the last of him.\" But that didn't worry Button Bright, who was  so careless that he did not seem to be able to break the habit of  getting lost.    The second addition to the party was a Munchkin boy of about Button  Bright's age, named Ojo. He was often called \"Ojo the Lucky,\" because  good fortune followed him wherever he went. He and Button Bright were  close friends, although of such different natures, and Trot and Betsy  were fond of both.    The third and last to join the expedition was an enormous lion, one of  Ozma's regular guardians and the most important and intelligent beast  in all Oz. He called himself the Cowardly Lion, saying that every  little danger scared him so badly that his heart thumped against his  ribs, but all who knew him knew that the Cowardly Lion's fears were  coupled with bravery and that however much he might be frightened he  summoned courage to meet every danger he encountered. Often he had  saved Dorothy and Ozma in times of peril, but afterward he moaned and  trembled and wept because he had been so scared.    \"If Ozma needs help, I'm going to help her,\" said the great beast.  \"Also, I suspect the rest of you may need me on the journey--especially  Trot and Betsy--for you may pass through a dangerous part of the  country. I know that wild Gillikin country pretty well. Its forests  harbor many ferocious beasts.\"    They were glad the Cowardly Lion was to join them, and in good spirits  the entire party formed a procession and marched out of the Emerald  City amid the shouts of the people, who wished them success and a safe  return with their beloved Ruler.    They followed a different route from that taken by Ozma and Dorothy,  for they went through the Winkie Country and up north toward Oogaboo.  But before they got there they swerved to the left and entered the  Great Gillikin Forest, the nearest thing to a wilderness in all Oz.  Even the Cowardly Lion had to admit that certain parts of this forest  were unknown to him, although he had often wandered among the trees,  and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, who were great travelers, never had  been there at all.    The forest was only reached after a tedious tramp, for some of the  Rescue Expedition were quite awkward on their feet. The Patchwork Girl  was as light as a feather and very spry; the Tin Woodman covered the  ground as easily as Uncle Henry and the Wizard; but Tik-Tok moved  slowly and the slightest obstruction in the road would halt him until  the others cleared it away. Then, too, Tik-Tok's machinery kept running  down, so Betsy and Trot took turns in winding it up.    The Scarecrow was more clumsy but less bother, for although he often  stumbled and fell he could scramble up again and a little patting of  his straw-stuffed body would put him in good shape again.    Another awkward one was Jack Pumpkinhead, for walking would jar his  head around on his neck and then he would be likely to go in the wrong  direction. But the Frogman took Jack's arm and then he followed the  path more easily.    Cap'n Bill's wooden leg didn't prevent him from keeping up with the  others and the old sailor could walk as far as any of them.    When they entered the forest the Cowardly Lion took the lead. There was  no path here for men, but many beasts had made paths of their own which  only the eyes of the Lion, practiced in woodcraft, could discern. So he  stalked ahead and wound his way in and out, the others following in  single file, Glinda being next to the Lion.    There are dangers in the forest, of course, but as the huge Lion headed  the party he kept the wild denizens of the wilderness from bothering  the travelers. Once, to be sure, an enormous leopard sprang upon the  Glass Cat and caught her in his powerful jaws, but he broke several of  his teeth and with howls of pain and dismay dropped his prey and  vanished among the trees.    \"Are you hurt?\" Trot anxiously inquired of the Glass Cat.    \"How silly!\" exclaimed the creature in an irritated tone of voice;  \"nothing can hurt glass, and I'm too solid to break easily. But I'm  annoyed at that leopard's impudence. He has no respect for beauty or  intelligence. If he had noticed my pink brains work, I'm sure he would  have realized I'm too important to be grabbed in a wild beast's jaws.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Trot consolingly; \"I'm sure he won't do it again.\"    They were almost in the center of the forest when Ojo, the Munchkin  boy, suddenly said: \"Why, where's Button Bright?\"    They halted and looked around them. Button Bright was not with the  party.    \"Dear me,\" remarked Betsy, \"I expect he's lost again!\"    \"When did you see him last, Ojo?\" inquired Glinda.    \"It was some time ago,\" replied Ojo. \"He was trailing along at the end  and throwing twigs at the squirrels in the trees. Then I went to talk  to Betsy and Trot, and just now I noticed he was gone.\"    \"This is too bad,\" declared the Wizard, \"for it is sure to delay our  journey. We must find Button Bright before we go any farther, for this  forest is full of ferocious beasts that would not hesitate to tear the  boy to pieces.\"    \"But what shall we do?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"If any of us leaves the  party to search for Button Bright he or she might fall a victim to the  beasts, and if the Lion leaves us we will have no protector.    \"The Glass Cat could go,\" suggested the Frogman. \"The beasts can do her  no harm, as we have discovered.\"    The Wizard turned to Glinda.    \"Cannot your sorcery discover where Button Bright is?\" he asked.    \"I think so,\" replied the Sorceress.    She called to Uncle Henry, who had been carrying her wicker box, to  bring it to her, and when he obeyed she opened it and drew out a small  round mirror. On the surface of the glass she dusted a white powder and  then wiped it away with her handkerchief and looked in the mirror. It  reflected a part of the forest, and there, beneath a wide-spreading  tree, Button Bright was lying asleep. On one side of him crouched a  tiger, ready to spring; on the other side was a big gray wolf, its  bared fangs glistening in a wicked way.    \"Goodness me!\" cried Trot, looking over Glinda's shoulder. \"They'll  catch and kill him sure.\"    Everyone crowded around for a glimpse at the magic mirror.    \"Pretty bad--pretty bad!\" said the Scarecrow sorrowfully.    \"Comes of getting lost!\" said Cap'n Bill, sighing.    \"Guess he's a goner!\" said the Frogman, wiping his eyes on his purple  silk handkerchief.    \"But where is he?  Can't we save him?\" asked Ojo the Lucky.    \"If we knew where he is we could probably save him,\" replied the little  Wizard, \"but that tree looks so much like all the other trees, that we  can't tell whether it's far away or near by.\"    \"Look at Glinda!\" exclaimed Betsy    Glinda, having handed the mirror to the Wizard, had stepped aside and  was making strange passes with her outstretched arms and reciting in  low, sweet tones a mystical incantation. Most of them watched the  Sorceress with anxious eyes, despair giving way to the hope that she  might be able to save their friend. The Wizard, however, watched the  scene in the mirror, while over his shoulders peered Trot, the  Scarecrow and the Shaggy Man.    What they saw was more strange than Glinda's actions. The tiger started  to spring on the sleeping boy, but suddenly lost its power to move and  lay flat upon the ground. The gray wolf seemed unable to lift its feet  from the ground. It pulled first at one leg and then at another, and  finding itself strangely confined to the spot began to back and snarl  angrily. They couldn't hear the barkings and snarls, but they could see  the creature's mouth open and its thick lips move. Button Bright,  however, being but a few feet away from the wolf, heard its cries of  rage, which wakened him from his untroubled sleep. The boy sat up and  looked first at the tiger and then at the wolf. His face showed that  for a moment he was quite frightened, but he soon saw that the beasts  were unable to approach him and so he got upon his feet and examined  them curiously, with a mischievous smile upon his face. Then he  deliberately kicked the tiger's head with his foot and catching up a  fallen branch of a tree he went to the wolf and gave it a good  whacking. Both the beasts were furious at such treatment but could not  resent it.    Button Bright now threw down the stick and with his hands in his  pockets wandered carelessly away.    \"Now,\" said Glinda, \"let the Glass Cat run and find him. He is in that  direction,\" pointing the way, \"but how far off I do not know. Make  haste and lead him back to us as quickly as you can.\"    The Glass Cat did not obey everyone's orders, but she really feared the  great Sorceress, so as soon as the words were spoken the crystal animal  darted away and was quickly lost to sight.    The Wizard handed the mirror back to Glinda, for the woodland scene had  now faded from the glass. Then those who cared to rest sat down to  await Button Bright's coming. It was not long before hye appeared  through the trees and as he rejoined his friends he said in a peevish  tone:    \"Don't ever send that Glass Cat to find me again. She was very impolite  and, if we didn't all know that she had no manners, I'd say she  insulted me.\"    Glinda turned upon the boy sternly.    \"You have caused all of us much anxiety and annoyance,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#14)"],[1,"shocks, unite, and produce nitrous acid.

Azote is one of the most abundant elements in nature, and combined with  calorique or heat, it forms azotic gas or phlogistic air, and composes  two thirds of the atmosphere; and is one of the principal component  parts of animal bodies, and when united to vital air or oxygene produces  the nitrous acid.

[_Hence dusky Iron_. l. 183. The production of iron from the  decomposition of vegetable bodies is perpetually presented to our view;  the waters oozing from all morasses are chalybeate, and deposit their  ochre on being exposed to the air, the iron acquiring a calciform state  from its union with oxygene or vital air. Where thin morasses lie on  beds of gravel the latter are generally stained by the filtration of  some of the chalybeate water through them. This formation of iron from  vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other  parts of vegetables, so frequently found in the centre of the knobs or  nodules of some iron-ores.    In some of these nodules there is a nucleus of whiter iron-earth  surrounded by many concentric strata of darker and lighter iron-earth  alternately. In one, which now lies before me, the nucleus is a prism of  a triangular form with blunted angles, and about half an inch high, and  an inch and half broad; on every side of this are concentric strata of  similar iron-earth alternately browner and less brown; each stratum is  about a tenth of an inch in thickness and there are ten of them in  number. To what known cause can this exactly regular distribution of so  many earthy strata of different colours surrounding the nucleus be  ascribed? I don't know that any mineralogists have attempted an  explanation of this wonderful phenomenon. I suspect it is owing to the  polarity of the central nucleus. If iron-filings be regularly laid on  paper by means of a small sieve, and a magnet be placed underneath, the  filings will dispose themselves in concentric curves with vacant  intervals between them. Now if these iron-filings are conceived to be  suspended in a fluid, whose specific gravity is similar to their own,  and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid, it is easy  to foresee that the iron filings would dispose themselves into  concentric spheres, with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between  them, exactly as is seen in these nodules of iron-earth. As all the  lavas consist of one fourth of iron, (Kirvan's Mineral) and almost all  other known bodies, whether of animal or vegetable origin, possess more  or less of this property, may not the distribution of a great portion of  the globe of the earth into strata of greater or less regularity be  owing to the polarity of the whole?]    [_And turn to adamant_. l. 192. The circumstances which render iron more  valuable to mankind than any other metal are, 1. its property of being  rendered hard to so great a degree and thus constituting such excellent  tools. It was the discovery of this property of iron, Mr. Locke thinks,  that gave such pre-eminence to the European world over the American one.  2. Its power of being welded; that is, when two pieces are made very hot  and applied together by hammering, they unite compleatly, unless any  scale of iron intervenes; and to prevent this it is usual for smiths to  dip the very hot bar in sand, a little of which fuses into fluid glass  with the scale and is squeezed out from between the uniting parts by the  force of hammering. 3. Its power of acquiring magnetism.    It is however to be wished that gold or silver were discovered in as  great quantity as iron, since these metals being indestructible by  exposure to air, water, fire or any common acids would supply wholesome  vessels for cookery, so much to be desired, and so difficult to obtain,  and would form the most light and durable coverings for houses, as well  as indestructible fire-grates, ovens, and boiling vessels.

[_Last Michell's hands_. l. 193. The discovery of the magnet seems to  have been in very early times; it is mentioned by Plato, Lucretius,  Pliny, and Galen, and is said to have taken its name of magnes from  Magnesia, a sea-port of antient Lybia.    As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a  magnet became itself a magnet, many attempts were made to improve these  artificial magnets, but without much success till Servingdon Savary,  Esq. made them of hardened steel bars, which were so powerful that one  of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the same  weight. Philos. Trans.    After this Dr. Knight made very successful experiments on this subject,  which, though he kept his method secret, seems to have excited others to  turn their attention to magnetism. At this time the Rev. Mr. Michell  invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making  strong artificial magnets, which he published in the end of the year  1750, in which he explained his method of what he called \"the double  touch\", and which, since Mr. Knight's method has been known, appears to  be somewhat different from it.    This method of rendering bars of hardened steel magnetical consists in  holding vertically two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each  other with their opposite poles very near each other (but nevertheless  separated to a small distance), these are to be slided over a line of  bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward. See Michell on  Magnetism, also a detailed account in Chamber's Dictionary.    What Mr. Michell proposed by this method was to include a very small  portion of the horizontal bars, intended to be made magnetical, between  the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical, and by sliding  them from end to end every part of the line of bars became successively  included, and thus bars possessed of a very small degree of magnetism to  begin with, would in a few times sliding backwards and forwards make the  other ones much more magnetical than themselves, which are then to be  taken up and used to touch the former, which are in succession to be  laid down horizontally in a line.    There is still a great field remains for future discoveries in magnetism  both in respect to experiment and theory; the latter consists of vague  conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps those of Elpinus, as  they assimulate it to electricity.    One conjecture I shall add, viz. that the polarity of magnetism may be  owing to the earth's rotatory motion. If heat, electricity, and  magnetism are supposed to be fluids of different gravities, heat being  the heaviest of them, electricity the next heavy, and magnetism the  lightest, it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the  heat will be accumulated most over the line, electricity"]]]
