Then, after ten seconds of listening, he  flashed on the spy's powerful light. At once the whole wrecked place  stood out in bold relief.    By some miracle the great chimney had withstood the shock. The fireplace  had been blown clean of ashes.    \"Dave, you were a gem.\" These were Cherry's first words. \"If there had  been a spark of fire!\"    \"It's a miracle that anything is left,\" said Applegate. \"Of course  you'll all come up to live with us.\"    \"Oh, no.\" Alice spoke slowly. \"The children would worry Lady Applegate.  I--I'm sorry. We still have furniture and cooking things. I'm sure quite  enough. And there's the Hideout up at the foot of the hill. It's quite  large and hidden among the trees. We may,\" she hesitated, \"may need to  borrow a few dishes. We--we don't seem to have any.\"    \"There are whole china cupboardsful at our house. I'll have a car full  of them down first thing in the morning.    \"Sure that's all?\" the young Lord asked anxiously.    \"No, not quite.\" Cherry smiled a shy smile as she whispered hoarsely.  \"I--I'm quite sure that Alice's dream-robes and mine have gone to grace  the Milky Way.\"    \"That also shall be attended to,\" said the young Lord, after they had  enjoyed a good laugh.    The trusty old farm truck was backed out of its shed. Beds, chairs,  blankets, pots, pans, and quantities of food were piled on. Then they  rattled away up the hill to the Hideout.    After building a fire on the wide old hearth they put things in such  order as they could for the night.    After the others had been made comfortable and were asleep Dave and  Cherry still sat by the fire.    \"We're always last,\" Cherry whispered hoarsely. \"It takes time for our  nerves to run down. They're like a cheap old alarm clock, I guess.\" She  laughed.    \"That's it,\" Dave agreed.    \"Brand and I are signing up tomorrow,\" he said after a time.    \"I thought Brand would, after this night. Who wouldn't?\" Her whisper was  tense with emotion. \"It's his country. But why you? It's not yours.\"    \"In America,\" Dave replied soberly, \"we have a saying, 'A man's home is  where he hangs his hat'. Your home has been mine. It has been bombed.  And so--\"    He did not finish. Just sat there staring at the fire. \"There's a lot  more to it than that,\" he went on after a time. \"It's easy enough to  say, 'It's not my war', when you're far away. But when you are here,  when you see how this war is being fought, defenseless women and  children who never harmed anyone being killed and country homes bombed.  Good God! How can you help wanting to fight?    \"And there's still more to it,\" he added after a moment's silence. \"This  flying sort of gets you. I've been within its grip since the first time  I went up.    \"And flyer fighting.\" He took a long breath. \"It's like our American  football. It's a game. The other fellow has the ball. You go after him.  You have the ball. He goes after you. You dodge this way and that. You  stiff arm him if he gets close. You lean like the Tower of Pisa, you  zigzag and weave like a sapling in the wind. Flyer fighting is like  that.\"    \"But the score?\" Cherry whispered.    \"Ah, yes,\" Dave murmured. \"The score must always be heavy on your side.\"    They were silent. At last Cherry whispered: \"I seem to hear applause,  the way you hear it on the radio. Per--perhaps it's the applause of  angels. Perhaps the applause is for you. Anyway, here's wishing you  luck.\" She put out a slender hand to seize his in a quick, nervous grip.    A quarter hour later the girl was beneath the blankets beside her sister  and Dave, rolled in a thick, soft rug before the fire, was fast asleep.                                       _Chapter_ XVI                              Fiddlin' Johnny      Two nights later they were all seated about the fire in the Hideout.  Their new home was small but not too crowded for company. Young Lord  Applegate and two of his flying buddies were there. Beside the Lord,  whom Dave had met some days before, there was a flyer they had nicknamed  Fiddlin' Johnny. Johnny was slender, fair-haired and dreamy-eyed. \"Just  the sort that doesn't seem to belong in the air,\" Applegate had said to  Dave. \"But he's got a real record. You'd be surprised.\"    \"Give us a tune, Johnny,\" Brand urged, as Alice's tea warmed their  souls.    \"Oh, all right!\" Johnny rose awkwardly. \"I'm not much of a fiddler, but  anything to please.\" After blowing on a strange little pipe, he tuned  his violin, then was away to a good start.    The moment his bow slid across the strings Cherry knew they were in for  a rare treat. Paying little attention to his audience nor even to their  applause, Johnny launched into a series of quaint, melodious, old tunes.  Like a slow-flowing river he drifted from one to another and yet  another. All unconscious of those about him, he played on and on. He  appeared to play not for them but for the few birds lingering among bare  branches of wind-lashed trees outside, or perhaps to the angels in  heaven.    \"Oh!\" Cherry breathed, when at last he returned his violin to its  battered case. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" She turned to the young Lord.  \"Why didn't you bring him to one of our subway songfests?\"    \"Johnny!\" The young Lord laughed. \"He'd never remember when to stop.\"    \"Stop!\" the girl exclaimed in her hoarse whisper. \"Who would want him to  stop? That--why that was divine.\"    \"Oh! Thank you! Thank you!\" Johnny's face flushed.    \"He's just the same when he's in the air fighting,\" said the young Lord.  \"Flies as if he were in a dream and never thinks to stop. He--\"    Suddenly he broke off. Someone had turned on the short-wave radio. It  was low. Reaching over, he turned it louder.    \"Get an earful of this.\" His lips were curled in scorn.    The man on the radio was saying in fairly good English, \"The quality of  the British fighters is laughable.\"    \"How do you mean?\" a voice on the radio asked.    \"That's Helmuth Wick, the boasting Hun,\" the young Lord whispered.    \"They merely try to stay out of our reach, those English fighters,\" said  the boasting German pilot. \"This shows that the best English pilots have  already been shot down. They fire furiously but never hit anything. It  must make them very annoyed.\"    \"Well, thank you, Major Wick,\" said the interviewer on the air. \"That's  all we have had time for now. Nice to have had you with us.\"    \"That broadcast is for America,\" the young Lord explained. \"It _is_ nice  they had him with them tonight. He won't be with them long. We're all  after him. No one loves a boaster. Besides, he's a dirty fighter.\"    \"And does he boast!\" The Lark put in. \"Claims fifty planes shot down, or  is it sixty. No matter. He's head of a flight and sees to it that he  stays ahead. One of his fighters always protects him from behind. If he  sees one of our planes that's shot up and wobbling, he just steps in and  finishes them off. And that's number forty-seven, or fifty-seven. Or  what--\"    \"We caught up with him once,\" the young Lord laughed. \"The Lark here  downed the man who protected him from behind. I would have polished him  off right then but I got a slug in my motor. Oil started spurting. So I  had to make a crash landing.    \"Too bad, Johnny wasn't with us,\" he added with a good-natured laugh.  \"Johnny'd been up there fighting yet.\"    \"I'll be with you next time,\" Fiddlin' Johnny said, and he did not  laugh. \"Tomorrow,\" he went on, \"we'll be up with the dawn. The O. C.  told me that just before I left. Said we could go up in five formation.\"    \"Who?\" Dave sat up quick.    \"You'll be in on it,\" Johnny grinned. \"You and Brand. Only the O. C.  said we were to watch and see that you don't do anything rash.\"    \"You watch them! That's a joke.\" The Lark gave Johnny a slap on the  shoulder. \"All you can see when you're in the air is crosses and  swastikas.\"    \"All the same,\" the young Lord insisted, \"Johnny's one swell little  fighter.\"    A half hour later they were gone, leaving Cherry to wonder how many of  them would return, and how soon.    At dawn five Spitfires left the landing field. They flew in formation,  first the young Lord, then the Lark. After these came Dave and Brand.  Fiddlin' Johnny brought up the rear.    It was a beautiful morning. Red still streaked the eastern sky. Did they  see the sky? Perhaps Johnny did. He saw and heard everything that was  beautiful. Dave did not see the sky. He saw only his instrument board,  thought only of that which might be ahead. For they were the dawn  patrol. And out of many a dawn, when the thin clouds were still red and  gold, had come death. Dave shuddered at the thought but kept straight on  his course.    Of a sudden he caught the young Lord's voice in the phone. It was high  and cheerful as he shouted:    \"Enemy ahead. Let's tap in.\"    'Tap in', Dave knew meant 'have a good time.' Would they have a good  time? Would they? He wondered. Then, as if he had taken a breath of pure  oxygen, his spirits soared. Have a good time? Why not? This was a game.  In this game one must have a good time or die.    They were putting on speed. At first he did not see the enemy. Then he  saw them all too well. Five Messerschmitts came zooming out of a thin  cloud. The rising sun struck their wings and turned them to burnished  silver.    \"Whoops!\" shouted the Lark. \"Up and at them, boys!\"    In a low, sober note the young Lord said, \"Boys that's the bragging Hun,  Wick, or I'm a liar!\"    \"Correct!\" shouted the Lark. \"His identical formation, V shape, one  behind on his right, three behind on the left. In a scrap he's safe.  Perfect, I'd say for a hero.\" Then in a roaring voice this red-headed  pilot sang, \"It's a long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go.\"    Dave didn't want to sing. Truth was, he could not have said a word. His  tongue at that instant was glued to the roof of his mouth. Only the  night"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#14)"],[1,"island, and as the galley shot past this,  a shout of exultation rose from the knights, for, near the mouth of an  inlet that now opened to their view, there lay four long, low vessels,  above each of which floated the Moslem flag. A number of men were  gathered on the shore near the ships, and heavily laden boats were  passing to and fro.    A yell of rage and alarm rose from the ships as the galley came into  view. There was a stir and movement on the shore, and numbers of men  leapt into the boats there, and started for the ships. These were some  quarter of a mile away when first seen, and half that distance had been  traversed when a puff of smoke shot out from the side of one of them,  followed almost immediately by a general discharge of their cannon. One  ball tore along the waist of the galley, killing six of the rowers, and  several oars on both sides were broken. Two balls passed through the  cabins in the poop. But there was no pause in the advance of the galley.  The whips of the slave masters cracked, and the rowers whose oars were  intact strained at them. There was no reply from the guns, but the  knights raised loud the war cry of the Order, a war cry that was never  heard without striking a thrill of apprehension among their Moslem foes.    As they neared the pirate ships, the helm was put down, and the galley  brought up alongside the largest of them and a broadside poured into  her; then the knights, headed by their commander, leapt on to her deck.    Although a number of the crew had not yet come off from shore, the  Moslems still outnumbered their assailants, and, knowing that their  consorts would soon come to their aid, they threw themselves in a body  on the Christians. But in a hand-to-hand conflict like this, the knights  of the Hospital were irresistible. Protected by their armour and long  shields from the blows of their enemies' scimitars and daggers, their  long, cross handled swords fell with irresistible force on turbaned head  and coat-of-mail, and, maintaining regular order and advancing like a  wall of steel along the deck, they drove the Moslems before them, and  the combat would soon have terminated had not a shout been raised by  one of the overseers of the slaves. One of the other ships had rowed  alongside the galley, and the crew were already leaping on board it. At  the same moment another ship came up alongside that they had boarded,  while the fourth was maneuvering to bring up under her stern.    \"Sir John Boswell,\" Sir Louis shouted, \"do you and your countrymen, with  the knights of Spain, finish with these miscreants; knights of Germany  and Provence keep back the boarders; knights of Auvergne follow me,\" and  he leapt down into the galley.    The English and Spanish knights redoubled their exertions. The Moslems  endeavoured to rally, seeing that help was at hand, and that but a small  body were now opposed to them, but their numbers availed little. The ten  knights kept their line, and, hewing their way forward, pressed them so  hotly that the Turks broke and sprang over the bulwarks into the sea.  Then the knights looked round. A fierce fight was going on between those  of Germany and Provence and the enemy, who strove desperately to board  from the ship alongside. The other vessel was now almost touching the  stern, and her crew were swarming to her side in readiness to leap on  board as soon as the vessels touched.    \"We will keep them at bay there,\" Sir John Boswell shouted. \"Do you, Don  Pedro, and your comrades, aid Ricord. When his foes are finished with,  you can come back to help us.\"    Then, with the four English knights, he ran along the deck, and reached  the stern just in time to hurl backwards the Moslems, who had already  obtained a footing. For a time the five knights kept back the surging  mass of their foes. The deck was wide enough for each to have fair play  for his sword, and in vain the pirates strove to obtain a footing.    At last Sir Marmaduke Lumley fell, severely wounded by an arrow from a  Moslem marksman, and before the others could close the gap a score of  pirates leapt on to the deck.    \"Fall back, comrades, fall back; but keep together!\" Sir John Boswell  shouted, as he cleft the skull of one of the pirate officers who sprang  at him. \"Sir Louis will soon finish his work, and be here to our aid.  Ah!\" he exclaimed, looking over his shoulder, as he retired a step,  \"Provence and Germany are overmatched too.\"    This was indeed the case. Stoutly as they fought the knights were unable  to guard the whole of the line of bulwark, and the Moslems had already  obtained a footing on the deck. The discipline of the knights stood them  in good stead. Drawing closely together as they retreated, they made a  stand on the opposite side of the deck, and were here joined by Sir John  Boswell and his companions. They now formed a semicircle, each flank  resting on the bulwark, and the pirates in vain endeavoured to break  their line. Again and again they flung themselves upon the knights, only  to be beaten off with heavy loss. At length a loud cheer arose from the  galley, and Sir Louis Ricord, with the knights of Auvergne and Spain  having cleared the galley of their foes, and carried the pirate that had  grappled with her, sprang on to the deck of the ship, and fell upon  the throng that were attacking the knights there, oblivious of what was  going on elsewhere. At once the English knights and their comrades took  the offensive, and fell upon their assailants who, at the sight of the  reinforcement, for a moment stood irresolute. For a short time there was  a fierce struggle; then the pirates sprang back to their two ships, and  endeavoured to cast off the grapnels. But the knights followed hotly  upon them, and, panic stricken now, the pirates sprang overboard. Many  were drowned, but the greater part managed to swim to shore.        CHAPTER V SCOURGES OF THE SEA      Breathless and faint from their tremendous exertions, the knights  removed their helmets.    \"By St. Mary,\" Sir Louis said, \"this has been as hard a fight as I have  ever been engaged in, and well may we be content with our victory! Well  fought, my brave comrades! Each of these vessels must have carried twice  our number at least, and we have captured four of them; but I fear the  cost has been heavy.\"    Seven knights had fallen, struck down by sword, arrow, or thrust of  spear. Of the rest but few had escaped unwounded, for, strong as was  their armour, the keen Damascus blades of the Moslems had in many cases  cut clean through it, and their daggers had found entry at points where  the armour joined; and, now that the fight was over, several of the  knights sank exhausted on the deck from loss of blood.    But the dressing of wounds formed part of a knight of St. John's  training. Those who were unwounded unbuckled the armour and bandaged the  wounds. Others fetched wine and water from the galley. The chains of the  galley slaves were removed, and these were set to clear the decks of the  Moslem corpses. The anchors were dropped, for what little wind there  was drifted them towards the shore. They had learned from a dying pirate  that the vessels were part of the fleet of Hassan Ali, a fact that added  to the satisfaction felt by the knights at their capture, as this man  was one of the most dreaded pirates of the Levant. They learnt that he  himself had not been present, the expedition being under the command of  one of his lieutenants, who had fallen in the fight.    \"Now, comrades, let us in the first place take food; we have not broken  our fast this morning. Then let us consider what had best be done, for  indeed we have got as much in our hands as we can manage; but let us  leave that till we eat and drink, for we are faint from want of food  and from our exertions. But we shall have to eat what comes to hand, and  that without cooking, for our servants all joined the pirates when they  boarded us, and are either dead or are ashore there.\"    A meal was made of bread and fruit, and this with wine sufficed to  recruit their energies.    \"It seems to me, comrades,\" Sir Louis said, when all had finished, \"that  the first thing is to search the holds of these vessels and see what  valuables are stored there. These may be all carried on board one ship,  and the others must be burnt, for it is clear that, as there are four of  them, we cannot take them to Rhodes; and even with one and our galley  we should fare but ill, if we fell in with two or three more of Hassan's  ships.\"    \"But how about the pirates on shore, Sir Louis?\" a knight asked. \"There  were very many who could not get off to their ships during the fight,  and scores must have swum ashore. I should say that there must be full  two hundred, and it will be a grievous thing for the islanders if we  leave them there.\"    \"It is certain,\" the commander said, \"that we are not strong enough  to attack them, for were we to land, a party would have to be left on  board, or the pirates might elude our search, seize some fishing boats,  and regain possession. Certainly, we are in no position to divide our  forces.\"    \"Methinks,\" Sir John Boswell said, \"that the best plan would be to send  a boat, manned with ten galley slaves, taking two or three of us to the  rendezvous, to fetch hither the other two galleys. With their aid we  might take all the four ships safe into port, after first clearing the  island of these pirates. It is but forty miles away, and eight hours'  rowing would take us there.\"    There was a general murmur of assent, for all wished that the trophies  of their bravery should, if possible, be carried to Rhodes.    \"That will certainly be the best plan, Sir John, though it may detain us  here for two or three days, or even more, for it is quite uncertain when  the other two galleys may put in at the rendezvous. Will you yourself  undertake the mission?\"    \"With pleasure.\"    \"How many will"]]]
