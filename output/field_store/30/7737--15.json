On the other hand, the chocolate sauce may be  served with custard mixtures or desserts that require additional flavor.  The fruit sauce, in which may be utilized any left-over juice from  canned or stewed fruit, may be served with any dessert with which it  seems to blend well.    CUSTARD SAUCE    1 c. milk  2 Tb. sugar  1/2 Tb. corn starch  Few grains of salt  1 egg  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, reserving enough to moisten the corn  starch. Mix the sugar, corn starch, and salt, and moisten with the cold  milk. Add this to the hot milk. Stir until thick and cook for about 15  minutes. Beat the egg, add this to the mixture, and continue cooking  until the egg has thickened. Add the vanilla, cool, and serve.    CHOCOLATE SAUCE    1 sq. chocolate  1 c. milk  4 Tb. sugar  Few grains of salt  3/4 Tb. corn starch  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Melt the chocolate over the fire, add half the milk, and cook together  for a minute or two. Add the sugar and salt to the corn starch, and  moisten with the remainder of the milk. Pour this into the chocolate and  milk and cook until thickened. Place in a double boiler and cook for 10  or 15 minutes. Add the vanilla and serve.    FRUIT SAUCE    1 Tb. corn starch  Sugar  Few grains of salt  1 c. fruit juice    Moisten the corn starch, sugar, and salt with the fruit juice, and cook  together until the corn starch has thickened the mixture. Place in a  double boiler and cook for 10 or 15 minutes. The amount of sugar must be  gauged by the kind of fruit juice used. If it is very sour, a greater  quantity of sugar will be needed. Cool and serve.    BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE    1-1/2 c. brown sugar  2/3 c. corn sirup  4 Tb. butter  3/4 c. cream    Boil sugar, sirup, and butter until the mixture reaches 230 degrees F.  or until it will form a very soft ball when tested in cold water. Remove  from the fire and allow it to cool a little; then beat the cream  into it.    FUDGE SAUCE    1 c. sugar  1/2 c. water  1 sq. chocolate  1 Tb. butter  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Mix together the sugar, water, and melted chocolate. Boil the mixture  for 5 minutes. Cool it slightly, then add the butter and vanilla.    15. WHIPPED CREAM.--Whipped cream is frequently served with cold  desserts in place of a sauce or as a garnish. If cream is too thin to  whip, it will have to be served plain, but it is an economy to whip it,  for whipped cream goes much further. To make whipping possible, the  cream must have a comparatively high percentage of fat. The higher the  percentage of fat, however, the more expensive will be the cream.    16. One of the requirements of successfully whipped cream, especially in  summer, is that it be as cold as possible. Warm cream does not whip  nearly so readily as cold. If it is necessary to whip cream in warm  weather or in a warm place, the bowl containing the cream may be packed  in a larger one containing ice and salt and allowed to stand for some  time before the whipping is begun.    17. A bowl-shaped utensil with a round bottom is the best to use for  whipping cream. Either an egg whip or a rotary beater may be used to do  the beating, which should be done rapidly. If the cream does not show  signs of whipping within a reasonable time, the result is likely to be  the formation of little globules of butter. Cream that whips properly  will become stiff and light in a short time. After cream has been  whipped till stiff, it should be sweetened slightly with sugar and  flavored with vanilla or any other desirable flavoring.           *       *       *       *       *      CUSTARD DESSERTS    PRINCIPLES OF CUSTARD MAKING    18. Many of the desserts that are served cold come under the head of  custards. These are dishes high in protein and consist of two varieties:  those thickened entirely by eggs and known as _true custards_ and those  in which a starchy material is used for part of the thickening. They may  be cooked by steaming, dry steaming, or baking.    19. In true custards there must be a sufficient number of eggs to  thicken the desired amount of milk, for nothing else produces  thickening. To these two ingredients may be added sweetening in the form  of sugar, sirup, honey, etc. and flavoring of any desirable kind. The  plain custard thus produced makes an excellent dessert and one that is  easily digested. In fact, it can be digested with such ease that it is  used perhaps more frequently in the diets of children and invalids than  any other single dessert. For instance, when it is necessary that eggs  and milk be taken in the diet, they usually become monotonous after a  time, but a little variety may be added to the diet by serving them in  the form of custard. While this is an expensive dessert when eggs are  high in price, its value is such that it should be prepared frequently  for children in spite of its cost.    20. Although custards are considered to decrease in quality as fewer  eggs are used and starch in some form is added for thickening, many  excellent custard desserts are made in this way. Then, too, plain  custard is often utilized in the making of desserts, such as tapioca,  rice, and bread puddings. In such an event, fewer eggs are used and the  starchy material is depended on for a certain amount of the thickening.  Because the starchy foods used are generally cheaper than eggs, custard  desserts that rely partly on starch for their thickening are more  economical than those thickened entirely by eggs. They are also  different in composition and texture, being lower in protein because of  a smaller proportion of eggs and higher in carbohydrate because of  additional starch; nevertheless, they are delicious desserts and find  much favor.    21. For its thickness, or solidity, a custard depends largely on the  thickening property of the protein material in the eggs. Here, again, as  in the preparation of other foods, only a certain proportion of milk and  eggs will thicken, or solidify, upon being cooked. In general, the  correct proportion for a plain custard is _1 egg to 1 cupful of milk_.  So important is this proportion that it should be memorized. Before the  eggs are added to the milk, they are, of course, beaten, but their  beating is a matter of little consequence, for they are used merely to  supply thickening and give richness and not to produce lightness.  Therefore, they need only be mixed well and beaten slightly, as any  increase in the amount of the beating adds nothing.    The sweetening and flavoring used in custards should be in sufficient  quantity to suit the tastes of those who are to eat the dessert.  However, the usual proportion of sugar is _1 tablespoonful to 1 egg and  1 cupful of milk_. A tiny pinch of salt added to a mixture of this kind  always improves its flavor and should never be omitted.    Because of the various ways of making custards, they differ somewhat  when they are done. They may be thin enough to pour or they may be set  and so thick that they can be cut. The consistency of the finished  product depends, of course, on the proportion of the ingredients used  and the method of cookery adopted.      RECIPES FOR CUSTARDS AND RELATED DESSERTS    22. BAKED CUSTARD.--Practically no skill is required in the preparation  of baked custard, but care must be taken during the baking in order that  the right temperature be applied for the proper length of time. Custard  of this kind is quickly made and finds favor with most persons. It may  be baked in individual baking dishes and then served in these or it may  be cooked in a large baking dish and served either before or after it is  placed on the table. Individual baking dishes are perhaps more  satisfactory, for, as there is a smaller amount of material, the heat  can penetrate more quickly and evenly to the center. Whatever kind of  dish is used, however, should be placed in a pan of warm water, so that  the custard will bake evenly. The water in the pan should not boil, as  this tends to make the custard whey, or separate.    [Illustration: FIG. 1, Testing doneness of custard with knife.]    23. Several tests can be applied to custard to determine whether it is  sufficiently baked. As the heat penetrates to the center last, this part  is the last to cook and it is therefore the place where the testing  should be done. One test consists in touching the center with the tip of  the finger to find out whether it is firm or not. A more common test,  however, is shown in Fig. 1. To perform this test, the blade of a silver  knife is inserted in the center, as illustrated. If the blade comes out  clean, it may be known that the custard is sufficiently baked, but if  the mixture sticks to the knife, the custard requires more baking.  Before the knife blade is inserted, however, the skin that covers the  custard must be broken; if this is not done, the skin is sure to cling  to the knife.    24. The chief requirement of a successful custard is that its texture be  right, and the temperature at which the baking is done is largely  responsible for this point. Too high a temperature or too long cooking  will cause the custard to curdle and leave the edges full of holes. A  smoother texture may be obtained if egg yolks alone instead of the yolks  and whites are used to thicken the custard. The proportions given in the  accompanying recipe make a custard of very good texture, but if a  greater proportion of eggs is used, the result will be a firmer,  harder custard.    BAKED CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    2 eggs  2 Tb. sugar  Pinch of salt  2 c. milk  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Beat the eggs slightly, add the sugar and salt, and continue beating  while adding the milk. Add the vanilla. Pour into a buttered baking dish  or individual baking dishes, place in a moderately hot oven in a pan of  warm water, and bake until the custard is set, testing with the finger  or a silver knife.

Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#14)"],[1," themselves forbid the use of some preservatives because of their harmful  effect on the human system. For this reason, to say nothing of the extra  expense that would be incurred in their use, such preservatives may well  be left alone.      GENERAL EQUIPMENT FOR CANNING    15. The equipment required for canning depends on two things: the  quantity of food to be canned at one time and, since there are several  canning methods in use, the canning method that is to be employed.    Various kinds of elaborate equipment have been devised to make the work  of canning easy as well as effective. However, it is possible to do  excellent work with simple equipment, and if the matter of expense must  be considered there should be no hesitation about choosing the simplest  and least expensive and doing the work in the best possible way with it.  It is important also that utensils already included in the household  equipment be improvised to meet the needs of the canning season as far  as possible.    16. Whatever the canning method that is to be followed may be, there are  a number of utensils and containers that go to make up the general  equipment that is required. Familiarity with such an equipment is  extremely necessary for correct results in canning, and for this reason  the general equipment is discussed here in detail. The special equipment  needed for each of the canning methods, however, is not taken up until  the method is considered. In giving this general equipment, mention is  made of some utensils that are convenient but not absolutely necessary.  Any unnecessary, but convenient, part of a canning equipment should  therefore be chosen with a view to its labor-saving qualities and its  expense. A device that will make the keeping of canned foods more  certain and prevent loss may be a valuable purchase; still, that which  makes for greater convenience, but not absolute saving, need not be  considered a necessity.    17. VESSELS FOR CANNING.--The pots, kettles, and pans in ordinary use in  the kitchen for cooking purposes are usually satisfactory for the  canning of foods. Those made of tin or iron, however, are not so good as  enameled ones or those made of other metals, such as aluminum.  Especially is this true of utensils used for the canning of acid fruits  or vegetables, because, if such food remains in contact with tin or iron  for more than a few minutes, the acid will corrode the surface  sufficiently to give the food a bad or metallic taste. In addition, such  utensils often give the food a dark color. If enameled kettles are used  for the cooking of foods that are to be canned, it is important that the  surface be perfectly smooth and unbroken. Otherwise, it will be  difficult to prevent burning; besides, chips of the enamel are liable to  get into the food. Kettles for the cooking of fruits with sirup should  be flat and have a broad surface. Fruit is not so likely to crush in  such kettles as in kettles that are deep and have a small surface.    18. KNIVES, SPOONS AND OTHER SMALL UTENSILS.--Many of the small utensils  in a kitchen equipment are practically indispensable for canning  purposes. Thus, for paring fruits and vegetables and cutting out cores,  blossoms, and stem ends or any defective spots, nothing is more  satisfactory than a sharp paring knife with a good point. For paring  acid fruits, though, a plated knife is not so likely to cause  discoloring as a common steel knife. There are, however, other useful  implements for special work, such as the _strawberry huller_, Fig. 1,  for removing the stems of strawberries, and the _peach pitter_, Fig. 2,  for removing the stones from clingstone peaches. For placing the food to  be canned into jars, both forks and large spoons are necessities. A  large spoon with holes or slits in the bowl is convenient for picking  fruits and vegetables out of a kettle when no liquid is desired, as well  as for skimming a kettle of fruit. For packing foods into jars, a  long-handled spoon with a small bowl is convenient. Still another useful  small utensil is a short, wide funnel that may be inserted into the  mouth of a jar and thus permit the food to be dipped or poured into it  without being spilled.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    19. DEVICES FOR MEASURING.--Accurate measures are necessary in canning;  in fact, some of the work cannot be done satisfactorily without them. A  half-pint measuring cup and a quart measure with the cups marked on it  are very satisfactory for making all measures.    Scales are often convenient, too. For measuring dry materials, they are  always more accurate than measures. Many canning proportions and recipes  call for the measurement of the ingredients by weight rather than by  measure. When this is the case and a pair of scales is not convenient,  it is almost impossible to be certain that the proportions are correct.  For instance, if a recipe calls for a pound of sugar and an equal amount  of fruit, a measuring cup will in no way indicate the correct quantity.    20. COLANDER AND WIRE STRAINER.--For the cleansing of fruits and  vegetables that are to be canned, a colander is of great assistance;  also, if a large wire strainer is purchased, it may be used as a sieve  and for scalding and blanching, steps in canning that are  explained later.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    21. GLASS JARS.--For household canning, the most acceptable containers  for food are glass jars that may be closed air-tight with jar rubbers  and tops. Use is sometimes made of bottles, jars, and cans of various  kinds that happen to be at hand, but never should they be employed  unless they can be fitted with covers and made positively air-tight.  Like utensils, the glass jars that are a part of the household supply  should be used from year to year, if possible, but not at the loss of  material. Such loss, however, will depend on the proper sealing of the  jars, provided everything up to that point has been correctly done. All  jars should be carefully inspected before they are used, because  imperfect or broken edges are often responsible for the spoiling  of food.    In purchasing glass jars, only what are known as _first quality_ should  be selected. Cheap jars are likely to be seconds and will not prove so  satisfactory. Glass jars may be purchased in sizes that hold from 1/2  pint to 2 quarts. If possible, food should be canned in the size of jar  that best suits the number of persons to be served.    If the family consists of two, pint jars will hold even more than may be  used at one time, while if the family is large the contents of a quart  jar may not be sufficient.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    22. Numerous types of glass jars are to be had. Some of them are more  convenient than others and may be made air-tight more easily. These two  features are the most important to consider in making a selection. Jars  that close with difficulty, especially if the tops screw on, are not  likely to keep food successfully because the bacteria in the air will  have a chance to enter and thus cause the food to spoil.    Glass jars used for canning foods have improved with canning methods.  The old-style jars had a groove into which the cover fit, and melted  sealing wax or rosin was poured into the space surrounding the cover.  Later came the screw-top jar shown in Fig. 3. This type of jar has been  extensively used with excellent results. Both the mouth of this jar and  the jar top, which is made of metal, usually zinc, lined with glass or  porcelain, have threads that match, and the jar is sealed by placing the  jar rubber over the top, or ridge, of the jar and then screwing the jar  top firmly in place. Such jars, however, are more difficult to make  air-tight than some of the newer types. One of these jars is illustrated  in Fig. 4. It is provided with a glass cover that fits on the ridge of  the jar and a metal clasp that serves to hold the cover in place and to  make the jar air-tight after a rubber is placed in position. Another  convenient and simple type of glass jar, known as the _automatic seal  top_, has a metal cover with a rubber attached.    Another improvement in jars is that the opening has been enlarged so  that large fruits and vegetables, such as peaches, tomatoes, etc., can  be packed into them whole. With such wide-mouthed jars, it is easier to  pack the contents in an orderly manner and thus improve the appearance  of the product. Besides, it is a simpler matter to clean such a jar than  one that has a small opening.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    23. JAR TOPS AND COVERS.--While the tops, or covers, for glass jars are  made of both metal and glass, as has been stated, the glass tops meet  with most favor. Of course, they are breakable, but they are even more  durable than metal tops, which are usually rendered less effective by  the bending they undergo when they are removed from the jar. Covers made  of zinc are being rapidly abandoned, and it has been proved that the  fewer the grooves and the simpler the cover, the more carefully and  successfully can it be cleaned. For safety, glass tops that have become  chipped or nicked on the edges that fit the jar should be replaced by  perfect ones. The covers for automatic-seal jars must be pierced before  they can be removed, and this necessitates a new supply for each  canning. If there is any question about the first-class condition of jar  covers, whether of metal or glass, tops that are perfect should  be provided.    24. JAR RUBBERS.--Jar rubbers are required with jar tops to seal jars  air-tight. Before they are used, they should be tested in the manner  shown in Fig. 5. Good jar rubbers will return to their original shape  after being stretched. Such rubbers should be rather soft and elastic,  and they should fit the jars perfectly and lie down flat when adjusted.  A new supply of rubbers should be purchased each canning season, because  rubber deteriorates as it grows old. Rubbers of"]]]
