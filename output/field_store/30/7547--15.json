The engine started--an internal-combustion engine  of well over a thousand horsepower, designed for maximum efficiency  by engineers in whose lexicon there were no counterparts of any  English words relating to noise, or even to sound. The car took off;  with an acceleration which drove the Tellurian backward, deep into the  cushions. The scream of tortured tires and the crescendo bellowing  of the engine combined to form an uproar which, amplified by and  reverberating within the resonant shell of metal, threatened to addle  the very brain inside the Lensman's skull.    \"You suffer!\" the driver exclaimed, in high concern. \"They cautioned  me to start and stop gently, to drive slowly and carefully, to bump  softly. They told me you are frail and fragile, a fact which I  perceived for myself and which has caused me to drive with the utmost  possible care and restraint. Is the fault mine? Have I been too rough?\"    \"Not at all. It isn't that. It's the ungodly noise.\" Then, realizing  that the Rigellian could have no conception of his meaning, he  continued quickly:    \"The vibrations in the atmosphere, from sixteen cycles per second up  to about nine or ten thousand.\" He explained what a second was. \"My  nervous system is very sensitive to those vibrations. But I expected  them and shielded myself against them as adequately as I could. Nothing  can be done about them. Go ahead.\"    \"Atmospheric vibrations? _Atmospheric_ vibrations? Atmospheric  _vibrations_?\" The driver marveled, and concentrated upon this entirely  new concept while he--    1. Swung around a steel-sheathed concrete pillar at a speed of at least  sixty miles per hour, grazing it so closely that he removed one layer  of protective coating from the metal.    2. Braked so savagely to miss a wildly careening truck that the  restraining straps almost cut Samms' body, space-suit and all, into  slices.    3. Darted into a hole in the traffic so narrow that only tiny fractions  of inches separated his hurtling Juggernaut from an enormous steel  column on one side and another speeding vehicle on the other.    4. Executed a double-right-angle reverse curve, thus missing by hair's  breadths two vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and one in  his own.    5. As a grand climax to this spectacular exhibition of insane driving,  he plunged at full speed into a traffic artery which seemed so full  already that it could not hold even one more car. But it could--just  barely could. However, instead of near misses or grazing hits, this  time there were bumps, dents--little ones, nothing at all, really,  only an inch or so deep--and an utterly hellish concatenation and  concentration of noise.    \"I fail completely to understand what effect such vibrations could  have,\" the Rigellian announced finally, sublimely unconscious that  anything at all out of the ordinary had occurred. For him, nothing had.  \"But surely they cannot be of any use?\"    \"On this world, I am afraid not. No,\" Samms admitted, wearily. \"Here,  too, apparently, as everywhere, the big cities are choking themselves  to death with their own traffic.\"    \"Yes. We build and build, but never have roads enough.\"    \"What are those mounds along the streets?\" For some time Samms had been  conscious of those long, low, apparently opaque structures; attracted  to them because they were the only non-transparent objects within range  of the Rigellian's mind. \"Or is it something I should not mention?\"    \"What? Oh, those? By no means.\"    One of the nearby mounds lost its opacity. It was filled with swirling,  gyrating bands and streamers of energy so vivid and so solid as to  resemble fabric; with wildly hurtling objects of indescribable shapes  and contours; with brilliantly flashing symbols which Samms found,  greatly to his surprise, made sense--not through the Rigellian's mind,  but through his own Lens:    \"EAT TEEGMEE'S FOOD!\"    \"Advertising!\" Samms' thought was a snort.    \"Advertising. You do not perceive yours, either, as you drive?\" This  was the first bond to be established between two of the most highly  advanced races of the First Galaxy!    The frightful drive continued; the noise grew worse and worse. Imagine,  if you can, a city of fifteen millions of people, throughout whose  entire length, breadth, height, and depth no attempt whatever had  ever been made to abate any noise, however violent or piercing! If  your imagination has been sufficiently vivid and if you have worked  understandingly enough, the product may approximate what First Lensman  Samms was forced to listen to that day.    Through ever-thickening traffic, climbing to higher and ever higher  roadways between towering windowless walls of steel, the massive  Rigellian automobile barged and banged its way. Finally it stopped, a  thousand feet or so above the ground, beside a building which was still  under construction. The heavy door clanged open. They got out.    And then--it chanced to be daylight at the time--Samms saw a tangle  of fighting, screaming _colors_ whose like no entity possessing the  sense of sight had ever before imagined. Reds, yellows, blues, greens,  purples, and every variation and inter-mixture possible; laid on or  splashed on or occurring naturally at perfect random, smote his eyes as  violently as the all-pervading noise had been assailing his ears.    He realized then that through his guide's sense of perception he had  been \"seeing\" only in shades of gray, that to these people \"visible\"  light differed only in wave-length from any other band of the complete  electromagnetic spectrum of vibration.    Strained and tense, the Lensman followed his escort along a narrow  catwalk, through a wall upon which riveters and welders were busily at  work, into a room practically without walls and ceiled only by story  after story of huge I-beams. Yet _this_ was the meeting-place; almost a  hundred Rigellians were assembled there!    And as Samms walked toward the group a craneman dropped a couple of  tons of steel plate, from a height of eight or ten feet, upon the floor  directly behind him.    \"I just about jumped right out of my armor,\" is the way Samms himself  described his reactions; and that description is perhaps as good as any.    At any rate, he went briefly out of control, and the Rigellian sent him  a steadying, inquiring, wondering thought. He could no more understand  the Tellurian's sensitivity than Samms could understand the fact that  to these people, even the concept of physical intrusion was absolutely  incomprehensible. These builders were not workmen, in the Tellurian  sense. They were Rigellians, each working his few hours per week for  the common good. They would be no more in contact with the meeting than  would their fellows on the other side of the planet.    Samms closed his eyes to the riot of clashing colors, deafened himself  by main strength to the appalling clangor of sound, forced himself to  concentrate every fiber of his mind upon his errand.    \"Please synchronize with my mind, as many of you as possible,\" he  thought at the group as a whole, and went en rapport with mind after  mind after mind. And mind after mind after mind lacked something. Some  were stronger than others, had more initiative and drive and urge, but  none would quite do. Until--    \"Thank God!\" In the wave of exultant relief, of fulfillment, Samms  no longer saw the colors or heard the din. \"You, sir, are of Lensman  grade. I perceive that you are Dronvire.\"    \"Yes, Virgil Samms, I am Dronvire; and at long last I know what it  is that I have been seeking all my life. But how of these, my other  friends? Are not some of them...?\"    \"I do not know, nor is it necessary that I find out. You will  select ...\" Samms paused, amazed. The other Rigellians were still in  the room, but mentally, he and Dronvire were completely alone.    \"They anticipated your thought, and, knowing that it was to be more or  less personal, they left us until one of us invites them to return.\"    \"I like that, and appreciate it. You will go to Arisia. You will  receive your Lens. You will return here. You will select and send to  Arisia as many or as few of your fellows as you choose. These things  I require you, by the Lens of Arisia, to do. Afterward--please note  that this is in no sense obligatory--I would like very much to have you  visit Earth and accept appointment to the Galactic Council. Will you?\"    \"I will.\" Dronvire needed no time to consider his decision.    The meeting was dismissed. The same entity who had been Samms'  chauffeur on the in-bound trip drove him back to the _Chicago_,  driving as \"slowly\" and as \"carefully\" as before. Nor, this time,  did the punishment take such toll, even though Samms knew that each  terrific lunge and lurch was adding one more bruise to the already  much-too-large collection discoloring almost every square foot of his  tough hide. He had succeeded, and the thrill of success had its usual  analgesic effect.    The _Chicago's_ captain met him in the air-lock and helped him remove  his suit.    \"Are you _sure_ you're all right, Samms?\" Winfield was no longer the  formal captain, but a friend. \"Even though you didn't call, we were  beginning to wonder ... you look as though you'd been to a Valerian  clambake, and I sure as hell don't like the way you're favoring those  ribs and that left leg. I'll tell the boys you got back in A-prime  shape, but I'll have the doctors look you over, just to make sure.\"    Winfield made the announcement, and through his Lens Samms could  plainly feel the wave of relief and pleasure that spread throughout the  great ship with the news. It surprised him immensely. Who was _he_,  that all these boys should care so much whether he lived or died?    \"I'm perfectly all right,\" Samms protested. \"There's nothing at all the  matter with me that twenty hours of sleep won't fix "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#14)"],[1,"of these different kinds of bacteria to  determine whether they are capable of producing normal ripening.  These experiments consist of making cheese out of milk that has  been deprived of its bacteria, and which has been inoculated with  large quantities of the species in question. Hitherto these  experiments have not been very satisfactory. In some cases the  cheese appears to ripen scarcely at all; in other cases the  ripening occurs, but the resulting cheese is of a peculiar  character, entirely unlike the cheese that it is desired to  imitate. There have been one or two experiments in recent times  that give a little more promise of success than the earlier ones,  for a few species of bacteria have been used in ripening with what  the authors have thought to be promising success. The cheese made  from the milk artificially inoculated with these species ripens in  a satisfactory manner and gives some of the character desired,  though up to the present time in no case has the typical normal  ripening been produced in any of these experiments.    But these experiments have demonstrated beyond question that the  abnormal ripening which is common in cheese factories is due to  the presence of undesirable species of bacteria in the milk. Many  of the experiments in making cheeses by means of artificial  cultures of bacteria have resulted in decidedly abnormal cheeses.  Many of the cheeses thus manufactured have shown imperfections in  ripening which are identical with those actually occurring in the  cheese factory. Several different species of bacteria have been  found which, when artificially used thus for ripening cheese, will  give rise to the porosity and the abnormal swelling of the cheese  already referred to (Fig. 24). Others produced bad tastes and  flavours, and enough has been done in this line to demonstrate  beyond peradventure that the abnormal ripening of cheese is due  primarily to the growth of improper species therein. Quite a long  list of species of bacteria which produce abnormal ripening have  been isolated from cheeses, and have been studied and experimented  with by bacteriologists. As a result of this study of abnormal  ripening, there has been suggested a method of partially  controlling these--remedying them. The method consists simply in  testing the fermenting qualities of the milk used. A small sample  of milk from different dairies is allowed to stand in the cheese  factory by itself until it undergoes its normal souring. If the  fermentation or souring that thus occurs is of a normal character,  the milk is regarded as proper for cheese making. But if the  fermentation that occurs in any particular sample of milk is  unusual; if an extraordinary amount of gas bubbles are produced,  or if unpleasant smells and tastes arise, the sample is regarded  as unfavourable for cheese making, and as likely to produce  abnormal ripening in the cheeses. Milk from this source would  therefore be excluded from the milk that is to be used in cheese  making. This, of course, is a tentative and an unsatisfactory  method of controlling the ripening, and yet it is one of some  practical value to cheese makers. It is the only method that has  yet been suggested of controlling the ripening.    Our bacteriologists, of course, are quite confident that in the  future more practical results will be obtained along this line  than in the past. If it is true that cheeses are ripened by  bacteria; if it is true that different qualities in the cheese are  due to the growth of different species of bacteria during the  ripening, it would seem to be possible to obtain the proper kind  of bacteria and to furnish them to the cheese maker for  artificially inoculating his cheese, just as it has been possible  to furnish artificially cultivated yeasts to the brewer, and as it  has become possible to furnish artificially cultivated bacteria to  the butter maker. We must, however, recognise this to be a matter  for the future. Up to the present time no practical results along  the lines of bacteria have been obtained which our cheese  manufacturers can make use of in the way of controlling with any  accuracy this process of cheese ripening.    Thus it will be seen that in this last dairy product bacteria play  even a more important part than in any of the others. The food  value of cheese is dependent upon the casein which is present. The  market price, however, is controlled entirely by the flavour, and  this flavour is a product of bacterial growth. Upon the action of  bacteria, then, the cheese maker is absolutely dependent; and when  our bacteriologists are able in the future to investigate this  matter further, it seems to be at least possible that they may  obtain some means of enabling the cheese maker to control the  ripening accurately. Not only so, but recognising the great  variety in the flavours of cheese, and recognising that different  kinds of bacteria undoubtedly produce different kinds of  decomposition products, it seems to be at least possible that a  time will come when the cheese maker will be able to produce at--  will any particularly desired flavour in his cheese by the  addition to it of particular species of bacteria, or particular  mixtures of species of bacteria which have been discovered to  produce the desired effects.            CHAPTER IV.    BACTERIA IN NATURAL PROCESSES.--AGRICULTURE.      Thus far, in considering the relations of bacteria to mankind, we  have taken into account only the arts and manufactures, and have  found bacteria playing no unimportant part in many of the  industries of our modern civilized life. So important are they  that there is no one who is not directly affected by them. There  is hardly a moment in our life when we are not using some of the  direct or indirect products of bacterial action. We turn now,  however, to the consideration of a matter of even more fundamental  importance; for when we come to study bacteria in Nature, we find  that there are certain natural processes connected with the life  of animals and plants that are fundamentally based upon their  powers. Living Nature appears limitless, for life processes have  been going on in the world through countless centuries with  seemingly unimpaired vigour. At the very bottom we find this  never-ending exhibition of vital power dependent upon certain  activities of micro-organisms. So thoroughly is this true that, as  we shall find after a short consideration, the continuance of life  upon the surface of the world would be impossible if bacterial  action were checked for any considerable length of time. The life  of the globe is, in short, dependent upon these micro-organisms.    BACTERIA AS SCAVENGERS.    In the first place, we may notice the value of these organisms  simply as scavengers, keeping the surface of the earth in the  proper condition for the growth of animals and plants. A large  tree in the forest dies and falls to the ground. For a while the  tree trunk lies there a massive structure, but in the course of  months a slow change takes place in it. The bark becomes softened  and falls from the wood. The wood also becomes more or less  softened; it is preyed upon then by insect life; its density  decreases more and more, until finally it crumbles into a soft,  brownish, powdery mass, and eventually the whole sinks into the  soil, is overgrown by mosses and other vegetation, and the tree  trunk has disappeared from view. In the same way the body of the  dead animal undergoes the process of the softening of its tissues  by decay. The softer parts of the body rapidly dissipate, and even  the bones themselves eventually are covered with the soil and  disintegrated, until in time they, too, disappear from any visible  existence. This whole process is one of decay, and the result is  that the solid mass of the body of the tree or of the animal has  been decomposed. What has become of it? The answer holds the  secret of Nature's eternal freshness. Part of it has dissipated  into the air in the form of gases and water vapour; part of it has  changed its composition and has become incorporated into the soil,  the final result being that the body of the plant or animal  disappears as such, and its substance is converted into gaseous  form, which is dissipated in the air or into simple compounds  which sink into the earth.    This whole process of decay of organic life is one in which  bacteria play the most important part. In the case of the  decomposition of the woody matter of the tree trunk, the process  is begun by the agency of moulds, for this group of organisms  alone appears to be capable of attacking such hard woody  structure. The later part of the decay, however, is largely carried  on by bacterial life. In the decomposition of the animal tissues,  bacteria alone are the agents. Thus the process by which organic  matter is dissipated into the air or incorporated into the soil is  one which is primarily presided over by bacterial life.    Viewing this matter in a purely mechanical light, the importance  of bacteria in thus acting as scavengers can hardly be  overestimated. If we think for a moment of the condition of the  world were there no such decomposing agents to rid the earth's  surface of the dead bodies of animals and plants, we shall see  that long since the earth would have been uninhabitable. If the  dead bodies of plants and animals of past ages simply accumulated  on the surface of the ground without any forces to reduce them  into simple compounds for dissipation, by their very bulk they  would have long since completely covered the surface of the earth  so as to afford no possible room for further growth of plants and  animals. In a purely mechanical way, then, bacteria as  decomposition agents are necessary to keep the surface of the  earth fresh and unencumbered so that life can continue.
