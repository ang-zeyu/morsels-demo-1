However, I have an old friend  at Genoa, the Countess of Mongolfiere; we exchange letters two or three  times a year. She is, of course, a patriot. I will, if your mother  agrees with me, enclose the bills in an envelope addressed to you, put  that in another with a letter saying that you will call at her house  when you arrive at Genoa, and request her to hand the letter to you. I  will say that it vitally concerns the cause, and beg her to place it  under lock and key in some safe receptacle until you arrive.\"    \"That is an excellent idea, mother,\" Mrs. Percival said, \"and would seem  to meet the difficulty.\"    Frank rose from his seat quietly, stepped noiselessly to the door, and  suddenly threw it open. To his surprise his mother's maid was sitting in  a chair against it, knitting.    \"It is all right, Hannah,\" he said, as she started to her feet. \"I did  not know you were there. I thought that fellow might be listening  again,\" and he closed the door.    \"I asked her to sit there this evening, Frank,\" Mrs. Percival said. \"I  knew that we should be talking this matter over, and thought it better  to take the precaution to ensure our not being overheard.\"    \"Quite right, mother; I am glad you did so. Then you think that that  plan will answer?\"    \"Yes, I think so; but you must be sure and take care of yourself, just  as if you had the money about you.\"    \"That I will, mother; you can rely upon that.\"    \"And above all,\" Signora Forli said, \"you must beware, when you go to  the Countess for the money, that you take every possible precaution.  Call in the daytime, go in a carriage and drive straight from her place  to the Villa Spinola; better still, go first to Garibaldi, tell him  where the money is, and ask him to send three of his officers to your  hotel on the following morning. Then take a carriage, drive to the  Countess's, and take it to the general with four of you in the carriage.  They would not dare to attack you in broad daylight.\"    \"That is an excellent plan,\" Mrs. Percival said, in a tone of great  relief. \"Certainly, if they do manage to search him on the way, and find  that he has not got the bills upon him, they will watch him closely at  Genoa, where, no doubt, they will get the assistance of some of  Francisco's agents. There are sure to be plenty of them in Genoa at  present; but however many of them there may be, they would not venture  to attack in daylight four men driving along what is no doubt a  frequented road, more especially as they would know that three of them  were Garibaldi's men, which is as much as to say desperate fellows, and  who would, no doubt, like yourself, be armed with pistols.\"    \"We had better take one more precaution,\" Signora Forli said. \"It is  believed that you are going to start on Thursday morning. Your packing  can be done in five minutes; and I think that it would be a good plan  for you to have everything ready to-night, and send Mary out for a  hansom to-morrow morning, so that you could, when it comes up to the  door, go straight down, get into it, and drive to the station. I don't  say that they might not be prepared for any sudden change of our plans;  but at least it would give you a chance of getting a start of them that  they can never recover--at any rate, not until you get to Paris.\"    \"How could they catch me there?\" Frank said.    \"Francisco's agents here might telegraph to his agents in Paris, and  they might be on the look-out for you when you arrived, and take the  matter up. You were going _via_ Calais. Let me look at the Bradshaw.\"    \"Yes,\" she said, after examining its pages; \"the train for the tidal  boat leaves at the same time as the Dover train. If, when you get into  the cab, you say out loud, 'Victoria,' so that Beppo may hear it, you  can then, when once on your way, tell the cabman to take you to Charing  Cross. In that way, if there is any one on the look-out when the Calais  train comes in, they will be thrown altogether off the scent.\"    \"It seems ridiculous, all these precautions,\" Frank said, with a laugh.    \"My dear, no precautions are ridiculous when you have Francisco's agents  to deal with. Now, I will write my letter to the Countess at once, so  that she may get it before your arrival there. You will, of course, go  out and post it yourself.\"          CHAPTER V    ON THE WAY.      After posting the letter, Frank made several small purchases, and was  more than an hour away. On his return he saw a cab standing at the door.  As he approached, Beppo came out with a portmanteau, handed it up to the  driver, jumped in, and was driven off.    \"So Beppo has gone, mother,\" he said, as he joined her in the  drawing-room.    \"Yes. He came in directly you had left. He said that his feelings had  been outraged by a servant being placed at the door. He could not say  why she was there, but thought it seemed as if he was doubted. He could  not but entertain a suspicion that she was placed there to prevent any  one listening at the keyhole; after such an insult as that he could not  remain any longer in the house. I said that he was at liberty to leave  instantly, as his wages had been paid only three days ago. He made no  reply, but bowed and left. Mary came up and told me ten minutes later  that he had brought his portmanteau down, left it in the hall, and gone  out, she supposed, to fetch a cab. I heard the vehicle drive up just  now, and the front door closed half a minute ago.\"    Signora Forli came into the room as she was speaking. \"Mary tells me  that Beppo has gone. It is a comfort that he is out of the house. When  you once begin to suspect a man, the sooner he is away the better. At  the same time, Frank, there can be no doubt that his going will not  increase your chances of reaching Genoa without being searched. I should  say that he had made up his mind to leave before you did, and he was  glad that the fact of Mary being at the door gave him a pretext for his  sudden departure. In the first place, he could conduct the affair better  than any one else could do, as he knows your face and figure so well.  Then, too, he would naturally wish to get the credit of the matter  himself, after being so long engaged in it. Of course, you may as well  carry out the plan we arranged, to start in the morning; but you may  feel absolutely certain that, whatever you may do, you will not throw  him off your track. He must know now that he is suspected of being a  Neapolitan agent, and that you will very likely change your route and  your time of starting.    \"I regard it as certain that the house will be watched night and day,  beginning from to-morrow morning, an hour or so before the trains leave.  There will be a vehicle with a fast horse close at hand, possibly two,  so that one will follow your cab, and the other drive at once to some  place where Beppo is waiting. As likely as not he will go via Calais. If  you go that way, so much the better; if not, he will only have to post  himself at the station at Paris. It is likely enough that during the  last day or two he has had one or two men hanging about here to watch  you going in and out, and so to get to know you well, and will have one  at each of the railway stations. He may also have written to the agents  in Paris to have a look-out kept for you there.\"    \"But how could they know me?\"    \"He would describe you closely enough for that; possibly he may have  sent them over a photograph.\"    Frank got up and went to a side table, on which a framed photograph that  had been taken when he was at home at Christmas, usually stood. \"You are  right,\" he said; \"it has gone.\" Then he opened an album. \"The one here  has gone, too, mother. Are there any more of them about?\"    \"There is one in my bedroom; you know where it hangs. It was there this  morning.\"    \"That has gone, too, mother,\" he said, when he returned to the room.    \"So you see, Muriel, I was right. The one from the album may have been  taken yesterday, and a dozen copies made of it; so that, even if you  give them the slip here, Frank, you will be recognised as soon as you  reach Paris.\"    \"Well, mother, it is of no use bothering any more about it. I have only  to travel in carriages with other people, and they cannot molest me; at  worst they can but search me, and they will find nothing. They cannot  even feel sure that I have anything on me; for now that Beppo knows he  is suspected of listening at doors, he will consider it possible that we  may have changed our plans about where we shall hide the money. It is  not as if they wanted to put me out of the way, you know; you and the  signora agreed that that is certainly the last thing they would do,  because there would be a tremendous row about it, and they would gain no  advantage by it; so I should not worry any further, mother. I do not  think there is the slightest occasion for uneasiness. I will just go by  Calais, as I had intended, and by the train I had fixed on; that in  itself will shake Beppo's belief that I have the money with me, for he  would think that if I had it I should naturally try some other way.\"    \"At any rate,\" Mrs. Percival said, \"you shall not go by the line that we  had intended. You would be obliged to travel by diligence from Dole to  Geneva, thence to Chambery, and again by the same method over the Alps  to Susa. You shall go straight from Paris to Marseilles; boats go from  there every two or three days to Genoa.\"    \"Very well, mother; I don't care which it is. Certainly there are far  fewer changes by that line; and to make your mind easy, I will promise  you that at Marseilles, if I have to stop there a night, I will keep my  bedroom door locked, and shove something heavy against it; in that way I  can't be caught asleep.\"    \"Well, I shall certainly feel more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#14)"],[1,"and  ascending to my bedroom in a disconsolate way, I found the Captain  and his lady there before me, my valise open, my wardrobe lying on the  ground, and my keys in the possession of the odious Fitzsimons. 'Whom  have I been harbouring in my house?' roared he, as I entered the  apartment. 'Who are you, sirrah?'    'SIRRAH! Sir,' said I, 'I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland.'    'You're an impostor, young man: a schemer, a deceiver!' shouted the  Captain.    'Repeat the words again, and I will run you through the body,' replied  I.    'Tut, tut! I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. REDMOND BARRY. Ah!  you change colour, do you--your secret is known, is it? You come like a  viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the  heir of my friends the Redmonds of Castle Redmond; I inthrojuice you to  the nobility and genthry of this methropolis' (the Captain's brogue was  large, and his words, by preference, long); 'I take you to my tradesmen,  who give you credit, and what do I find? That you have pawned the goods  which you took up at their houses.'    'I have given them my acceptances, sir,' said I with a dignified air.    'UNDER WHAT NAME, unhappy boy--under what name?' screamed Mrs.  Fitzsimons; and then, indeed, I remembered that I had signed the  documents Barry Redmond instead of Redmond Barry: but what else could  I do? Had not my mother desired me to take no other designation? After  uttering a furious tirade against me, in which he spoke of the fatal  discovery of my real name on my linen--of his misplaced confidence of  affection, and the shame with which he should be obliged to meet his  fashionable friends and confess that he had harboured a swindler, he  gathered up the linen, clothes, silver toilet articles, and the rest of  my gear, saying that he should step out that moment for an officer and  give me up to the just revenge of the law.    During the first part of his speech, the thought of the imprudence of  which I had been guilty, and the predicament in which I was plunged, had  so puzzled and confounded me, that I had not uttered a word in reply to  the fellow's abuse, but had stood quite dumb before him. The sense of  danger, however, at once roused me to action. 'Hark ye, Mr. Fitzsimons,'  said I; 'I will tell you why I was obliged to alter my name: which is  Barry, and the best name in Ireland. I changed it, sir, because, on  the day before I came to Dublin, I killed a man in deadly combat--an  Englishman, sir, and a captain in His Majesty's service; and if you  offer to let or hinder me in the slightest way, the same arm which  destroyed him is ready to punish you; and by Heaven, sir, you or I don't  leave this room alive!'    So saying, I drew my sword like lightning, and giving a 'ha! ha!' and  a stamp with my foot, lunged within an inch of Fitzsimons's heart, who  started back and turned deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream,  flung herself between us.    'Dearest Redmond,' she cried, 'be pacified. Fitzsimons, you don't want  the poor child's blood. Let him escape--in Heaven's name let him go.'    'He may go hang for me,' said Fitzsimons sulkily; 'and he'd better be  off quickly, too, for the jeweller and the tailor have called once,  and will be here again before long. It was Moses the pawnbroker that  peached: I had the news from him myself.' By which I conclude that Mr.  Fitzsimons had been with the new laced frock-coat which he procured from  the merchant tailor on the day when the latter first gave me credit.    What was the end of our conversation? Where was now a home for the  descendant of the Barrys? Home was shut to me by my misfortune in the  duel. I was expelled from Dublin by a persecution occasioned, I must  confess, by my own imprudence. I had no time to wait and choose: no  place of refuge to fly to. Fitzsimons, after his abuse of me, left the  room growling, but not hostile; his wife insisted that we should shake  hands, and he promised not to molest me. Indeed, I owed the fellow  nothing; and, on the contrary, had his acceptance actually in my pocket  for money lost at play. As for my friend Mrs. Fitzsimons, she sat down  on the bed and fairly burst out crying. She had her faults, but her  heart was kind; and though she possessed but three shillings in the  world, and fourpence in copper, the poor soul made me take it before  I left her--to go--whither? My mind was made up: there was a score of  recruiting-parties in the town beating up for men to join our gallant  armies in America and Germany; I knew where to find one of these, having  stood by the sergeant at a review in the Phoenix Park, where he pointed  out to me characters on the field, for which I treated him to drink.    I gave one of my shillings to Sullivan the butler of the Fitzsimonses,  and, running into the street, hastened to the little alehouse at which  my acquaintance was quartered, and before ten minutes had accepted His  Majesty's shilling. I told him frankly that I was a young gentleman in  difficulties; that I had killed an officer in a duel, and was anxious  to get out of the country. But I need not have troubled myself with any  explanations; King George was too much in want of men then to heed from  whence they came, and a fellow of my inches, the sergeant said, was  always welcome. Indeed, I could not, he said, have chosen my time  better. A transport was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a wind, and on  board that ship, to which I marched that night, I made some surprising  discoveries, which shall be told in the next chapter.          CHAPTER IV. IN WHICH BARRY TAKES A NEAR VIEW OF MILITARY GLORY    I never had a taste for anything but genteel company, and hate all  descriptions of low life. Hence my account of the society in which I  at present found myself must of necessity be short; and, indeed,  the recollection of it is profoundly disagreeable to me. Pah! the  reminiscences of the horrid black-hole of a place in which we soldiers  were confined; of the wretched creatures with whom I was now forced to  keep company; of the ploughmen, poachers, pickpockets, who had taken  refuge from poverty, or the law (as, in truth, I had done myself), is  enough to make me ashamed even now, and it calls the blush into my old  cheeks to think I was ever forced to keep such company. I should have  fallen into despair, but that, luckily, events occurred to rouse my  spirits, and in some measure to console me for my misfortunes.    The first of these consolations I had was a good quarrel, which took  place on the day after my entrance into the transport-ship, with a huge  red-haired monster of a fellow--a chairman, who had enlisted to fly from  a vixen of a wife, who, boxer as he was, had been more than a match for  him. As soon as this fellow--Toole, I remember, was his name--got away  from the arms of the washerwoman his lady, his natural courage and  ferocity returned, and he became the tyrant of all round about him.  All recruits, especially, were the object of the brute's insult and  ill-treatment.    I had no money, as I said, and was sitting very disconsolately over a  platter of rancid bacon and mouldy biscuit, which was served to us at  mess, when it came to my turn to be helped to drink, and I was served,  like the rest, with a dirty tin noggin, containing somewhat more than  half a pint of rum-and-water. The beaker was so greasy and filthy that I  could not help turning round to the messman and saying, 'Fellow, get me  a glass!' At which all the wretches round about me burst into a roar of  laughter, the very loudest among them being, of course, Mr. Toole.  'Get the gentleman a towel for his hands, and serve him a basin of  turtle-soup,' roared the monster, who was sitting, or rather squatting,  on the deck opposite me; and as he spoke he suddenly seized my beaker of  grog and emptied it, in the midst of another burst of applause.    'If you want to vex him, ax him about his wife the washerwoman, who  BATES him,' here whispered in my ear another worthy, a retired link-boy,  who, disgusted with his profession, had adopted the military life.    'Is it a towel of your wife's washing, Mr. Toole?' said I. 'I'm told she  wiped your face often with one.'    'Ax him why he wouldn't see her yesterday, when she came to the ship,'  continued the link-boy. And so I put to him some other foolish jokes  about soapsuds, henpecking, and flat-irons, which set the man into a  fury, and succeeded in raising a quarrel between us. We should have  fallen to at once, but a couple of grinning marines, who kept watch at  the door, for fear we should repent of our bargain and have a fancy to  escape, came forward and interposed between us with fixed bayonets;  but the sergeant coming down the ladder, and hearing the dispute,  condescended to say that we might fight it out like men with FISTES if  we chose, and that the fore-deck should be free to us for that purpose.  But the use of fistes, as the Englishman called them, was not then  general in Ireland, and it was agreed that we should have a pair  of cudgels; with one of which weapons I finished the fellow in four  minutes, giving him a thump across his stupid sconce which laid  him lifeless on the deck, and not receiving myself a single hurt of  consequence.    This victory over the cock of the vile dunghill obtained me respect  among the wretches of whom I formed part, and served to set up my  spirits, which otherwise were flagging; and my position was speedily  made more bearable by the arrival on board our ship of an old friend.  This was no other than my second in the fatal duel which had sent me  thus early out into the world, Captain Fagan. There was a young nobleman  who had a company in our regiment (Gale's foot), and who, preferring the  delights of the Mall and the clubs to the dangers of a rough campaign,  had given Fagan the opportunity of an exchange; which, as the latter had  no fortune but his sword, he was"]]]
