They killed and wounded  a great number of them and captured almost all the caracoas and vessels  of the enemy, so that very few boats escaped and they were pursued and  burned by the Spaniards, who made many prisoners, and seized immense  booty and many weapons from the enemy. As soon as possible after this,  the Spaniards turned against the settlements and forts of Buhahayen  where some of their results were of so great moment that the enemy,  seeing themselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them, sent  messages and proposals of peace to Don Juan Ronquillo, which were  ended by their rendering recognition and homage, and the renewal  of friendship with the people of Tampacan, their ancient enemy. In  order to strengthen the friendship, they sealed it by the marriage  of the greatest chief and lord of Buhahayen with the daughter of  another chief of Tampacan, called Dongonlibor. Thereupon the war was  apparently completely ended, provisions were now to be had, and the  Spaniards with little precaution crossed and went about the country  wherever they wished. The people of Buhahayen promised to dismantle  all their forts immediately, for that was one of the conditions of  peace. Then the Spaniards returned to their fort and settlement at  Tampacan, whence Don Juan Ronquillo immediately sent despatches to  Governor Don Francisco Tello, informing him of the different turn  that the enterprise had taken. In view of the present condition he  requested the governor to issue new instructions as to his procedure,  saying that he would wait without making any change, notwithstanding  the arrival of the answer which he expected to his first report,  for conditions had now become so much better than before that the  governor's decision would be different.    The governor had already answered Don Joan Ronquillo's first despatch,  as we have said above, when the second despatch arrived with news  of the successes in Mindanao. Suspicious of the men in the camp who  had constantly shown a desire to return to Manila, and little relish  for the hardships of war, and fearing lest they would return at the  arrival of the first order, executing that order and abandoning the  enterprise which had reached such a satisfactory stage; and thinking  that it would be unwise to abandon the river: the governor made haste  to send a second despatch immediately by various roads, ordering them  to pay no attention to his first orders, but to remain in Mindanao, and  that he would soon send them what was necessary for further operations.    It seems that this message traveled slowly; for, the first having  arrived, they obeyed it without any further delay, and camp was  raised and the country abandoned. To their former enemy of Buhahayen  they gave as a reason that the governor of Manila had summoned them;  and to their friends of Tampacan, they said that they would leave men  in La Caldera for their security, and that assistance would be sent  them from Manila. This news caused as much sorrow and sadness to the  latter, as joy to the people of Buhahayen. Then after burning their  fort and settlement, the Spaniards embarked all their forces as soon as  possible, left the river, and went to La Caldera, twenty-four leguas  farther down in the direction of Manila. Having entered port, they  built a fortress and left there a garrison of one hundred Spaniards,  with some artillery, provisions, and boats for their use.    At this juncture, the governor's second message to General Don Joan  Ronquillo arrived, to which the latter replied that he was already  in La Caldera, and could not return to the river. Then, without any  further delay, Don Juan Ronquillo went to Manila with the balance of  his fleet, by way of the provinces of Oton, and Panay. The governor,  having heard of his coming, sent to arrest him on the road before  he entered the city, and proceeded against him by law for having  withdrawn the camp and army from Mindanao River, without awaiting the  orders he should have expected after the favorable turn that affairs  had taken. Don Juan Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private  letter from the governor, which the latter had sent him separately  with the first instructions, to the effect that he should return  to Manila with his troops in any event, for they were needed in the  islands for other purposes; and because of this letter Don Juan had  determined not to await the second order.    Captain and Sargento-mayor Gallinato crossed from Cochinchina to Manila  in the flagship of his fleet, and informed Don Francisco Tello whom he  found governing, of the events of his expedition; and that Blas Ruyz  and Diego Belloso had gone by land to Lao from Cochinchina in search  of King Langara of Camboja. Thus by their absence he avoided the blame  of leaving Camboja, although there were not wanting many of his own  followers who angrily gave information of the opportunity that he had  lost by not showing himself or staying in Camboja when he had so good  an opportunity; and they stoutly asserted that if he had done so,  all that had been hoped in that kingdom would have been attained.    The other ship of his convoy, to which the balance of his fleet  had been reduced, of which he made Alférez Luys Ortiz commander,  could not pursue the voyage on account of heavy storms, and put in at  Malaca. Some of the Spaniards remained there, and Ortiz with the rest  of the crew, was able to set sail after a few months, and returned  to Manila.    Coincident with the above, and at the beginning of Don Francisco  Tello's administration, two Indian chiefs of the province of Cagayan,  the more powerful of whom was called Magalat, were detained in Manila,  because they, with their kinsmen, and others who followed their  party and opinion, often incited the settlements of that province to  rebellion; and it had cost no little trouble to subdue them; besides  the daily murder of many Spaniards and other injuries inflicted upon  the peaceful natives and their crops. Magalat was captain and leader  of these men, and since he, with his brother and other natives, was  in Manila, and unable to leave it, that province became more secure.    Some Dominican religious bound for Segovia, the capital of that  province, where they give instruction, moved with pity, persuaded  the governor to let Magalat and his brother return to their country  with them. To such an extent did they importune the governor, that  he granted their request. Having reached Cagayan, the chiefs went  inland by the Lobo River and again incited the whole country to  rebellion. With the help of other chiefs of Tubigarao, and other  settlements, they so stirred up things, that it was impossible to  go to those settlements or a step beyond the city. Magalat was the  leader of the rebels, and he committed cruel murders and injuries  even upon the natives themselves, if they refused to rise against the  Spaniards. This reached such a point that the governor was obliged  to send the master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves, from Manila with  troops, in order that he might suitably remedy the evil. In spite  of many difficulties, the latter had so good fortune that he seized  many insurgent leaders upon whom he executed justice and public  punishment. As for Magalat himself, the governor caused him to be  killed in his own house and land where he had fortified himself, by  the hand of his own Indians, who had offered to do it for a reward;  for in no other way did it appear possible. Had Magalat not been  killed, the war would have dragged on for many years, but with his  death the province became quiet and the peace secure.    In April of the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-five,  Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira sailed from Callao de Lima in  Peru, to colonize the Salomon Islands, which he had discovered many  years before in the South Sea, [66] the principal one of which he had  called San Christoval. He took four ships, two large ones--a flagship  and an almiranta--a frigate, and a galliot, with four hundred men  in all. He was also accompanied by his wife, Doña Ysabel Barreto and  his three brothers-in-law. On the way he discovered other islands at  which he did not stop; but not finding those which he had previously  discovered, and as his almiranta had been lost, he anchored with the  other ships at an island near Nueva Guinea, inhabited by blacks,  to which he gave the name of Santa Cruz [Holy Cross]. There he  settled--little to the satisfaction of his men. The adelantado, two of  his brothers-in-law, and many of his people died there. Doña Ysabel  Barreto abandoned the colony, on account of sickness and want, and  embarked the survivors aboard her flagship, frigate, and galliot. But  while they were sailing toward the Filipinas the frigate and galliot  disappeared in another direction. The flagship entered the river of  Butuan, in the island of Mindanao, and reached Manila after great  want and suffering. There Doña Ysabel Barreto married Don Fernando de  Castro, and returned to Nueva España in his ship, the \"San Geronymo,\"  in the year ninety-six. The events of this voyage have been only  lightly touched upon here, so that it seems fitting to reproduce  literally the relation, to which Don Pedro Fernandez de Quiros,  chief pilot on this voyage, affixed his signature, which is as follows.    Relation of the voyage of Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira for  the discovery of the Salomon Islands    On Friday, the ninth of the month of April, one thousand five hundred  and ninety-five, Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña set sail with his fleet  for the conquest and settlement of the western islands in the South  Sea, sailing from the port of Callao de Lima, which lies in twelve and  one-half degrees south latitude. Laying his course toward the valleys  of Santa, Truxillo, and Saña, and collecting men and provisions, he  went to Paita.

So saying our heroes parted, Mr. Oldbuck to return to his hospitium at  Monkbarns, and Lovel to pursue his way to Fairport, where he arrived  without farther adventure.          CHAPTER FIFTH.                         Launcelot Gobbo. Mark me now:                        Now will I raise the waters.                                           Merchant of Venice.    The theatre at Fairport had opened, but no Mr. Lovel appeared on the  boards, nor was there anything in the habits or deportment of the young  gentleman so named, which authorised Mr. Oldbuck's conjecture that his  fellow-traveller was a candidate for the public favour. Regular were the  Antiquary's inquiries at an old-fashioned barber who dressed the only  three wigs in the parish which, in defiance of taxes and times, were  still subjected to the operation of powdering and frizzling, and who for  that purpose divided his time among the three employers whom fashion  had yet left him; regular, I say, were Mr. Oldbuck's inquiries at  this personage concerning the news of the little theatre at Fairport,  expecting every day to hear of Mr. Lovel's appearance; on which occasion  the old gentleman had determined to put himself to charges in honour of  his young friend, and not only to go to the play himself, but to  carry his womankind along with him. But old Jacob Caxon conveyed no  information which warranted his taking so decisive a step as that of  securing a box.    He brought information, on the contrary, that there was a young man  residing at Fairport, of whom the town (by which he meant all the  gossips, who, having no business of their own, fill up their leisure  moments by attending to that of other people) could make nothing. He  sought no society, but rather avoided that which the apparent gentleness  of his manners, and some degree of curiosity, induced many to offer him.  Nothing could be more regular, or less resembling an adventurer, than  his mode of living, which was simple, but so completely well arranged,  that all who had any transactions with him were loud in their  approbation.    \"These are not the virtues of a stage-struck hero,\" thought Oldbuck to  himself; and, however habitually pertinacious in his opinions, he must  have been compelled to abandon that which he had formed in the  present instance, but for a part of Caxon's communication. \"The young  gentleman,\" he said, \"was sometimes heard speaking to himsell, and  rampauging about in his room, just as if he was ane o' the player folk.\"    Nothing, however, excepting this single circumstance, occurred to  confirm Mr. Oldbuck's supposition; and it remained a high and doubtful  question, what a well-informed young man, without friends, connections,  or employment of any kind, could have to do as a resident at Fairport.  Neither port wine nor whist had apparently any charms for him. He  declined dining with the mess of the volunteer cohort which had been  lately embodied, and shunned joining the convivialities of either of  the two parties which then divided Fairport, as they did more important  places. He was too little of an aristocrat to join the club of  Royal True Blues, and too little of a democrat to fraternise with an  affiliated society of the soi-disant Friends of the People, which the  borough had also the happiness of possessing. A coffee-room was his  detestation; and, I grieve to say it, he had as few sympathies with the  tea-table.--In short, since the name was fashionable in novel-writing,  and that is a great while agone, there was never a Master Lovel of whom  so little positive was known, and who was so universally described by  negatives.    One negative, however, was important--nobody knew any harm of Lovel.  Indeed, had such existed, it would have been speedily made public; for  the natural desire of speaking evil of our neighbour could in his case  have been checked by no feelings of sympathy for a being so unsocial. On  one account alone he fell somewhat under suspicion. As he made free use  of his pencil in his solitary walks, and had drawn several views of the  harbour, in which the signal tower, and even the four-gun battery, were  introduced, some zealous friends of the public sent abroad a whisper,  that this mysterious stranger must certainly be a French spy. The  Sheriff paid his respects to Mr. Lovel accordingly; but in the interview  which followed, it would seem that he had entirely removed that  magistrate's suspicions, since he not only suffered him to remain  undisturbed in his retirement, but it was credibly reported, sent him  two invitations to dinner-parties, both which were civilly declined. But  what the nature of the explanation was, the magistrate kept a profound  secret, not only from the public at large, but from his substitute, his  clerk, his wife and his two daughters, who formed his privy council on  all questions of official duty.    All these particulars being faithfully reported by Mr. Caxon to his  patron at Monkbarns, tended much to raise Lovel in the opinion of his  former fellow-traveller. \"A decent sensible lad,\" said he to himself,  \"who scorns to enter into the fooleries and nonsense of these idiot  people at Fairport--I must do something for him--I must give him a  dinner;--and I will write Sir Arthur to come to Monkbarns to meet him. I  must consult my womankind.\"    Accordingly, such consultation having been previously held, a special  messenger, being no other than Caxon himself, was ordered to prepare  for a walk to Knockwinnock Castle with a letter, \"For the honoured Sir  Arthur Wardour, of Knockwinnock, Bart.\" The contents ran thus:    \"Dear Sir Arthur,    \"On Tuesday the 17th curt. _stilo novo_, I hold a coenobitical symposion at  Monkbarns, and pray you to assist thereat, at four o'clock precisely. If  my fair enemy, Miss Isabel, can and will honour us by accompanying you,  my womankind will be but too proud to have the aid of such an auxiliary  in the cause of resistance to awful rule and right supremacy. If not,  I will send the womankind to the manse for the day. I have a young  acquaintance to make known to you, who is touched with some strain of  a better spirit than belongs to these giddy-paced times--reveres his  elders, and has a pretty notion of the classics--and, as such a youth  must have a natural contempt for the people about Fairport, I wish to  show him some rational as well as worshipful society.--I am, Dear Sir  Arthur, etc. etc. etc.\"    \"Fly with this letter, Caxon,\" said the senior, holding out his missive,  signatum atque sigillatum, \"fly to Knockwinnock, and bring me back an  answer. Go as fast as if the town-council were met and waiting for the  provost, and the provost was waiting for his new-powdered wig.\"    \"Ah sir,\" answered the messenger, with a deep sigh, \"thae days hae lang  gane by. Deil a wig has a provost of Fairport worn sin' auld Provost  Jervie's time--and he had a quean of a servant-lass that dressed it  herself, wi' the doup o' a candle and a drudging-box. But I hae seen the  day, Monkbarns, when the town-council of Fairport wad hae as soon wanted  their town-clerk, or their gill of brandy ower-head after the haddies,  as they wad hae wanted ilk ane a weel-favoured, sonsy, decent periwig on  his pow. Hegh, sirs! nae wonder the commons will be discontent and rise  against the law, when they see magistrates and bailies, and deacons, and  the provost himsell, wi' heads as bald and as bare as ane o' my blocks!\"    \"And as well furnished within, Caxon. But away with you!--you have an  excellent view of public affairs, and, I dare say, have touched the  cause of our popular discontent as closely as the provost could have  done himself. But away with you, Caxon!\"    And off went Caxon upon his walk of three miles--                      He hobbled--but his heart was good!                    Could he go faster than he could?--    While he is engaged in his journey and return, it may not be impertinent  to inform the reader to whose mansion he was bearing his embassy.    We have said that Mr. Oldbuck kept little company with the surrounding  gentlemen, excepting with one person only. This was Sir Arthur Wardour,  a baronet of ancient descent, and of a large but embarrassed fortune.  His father, Sir Anthony, had been a Jacobite, and had displayed all the  enthusiasm of that party, while it could be served with words only. No  man squeezed the orange with more significant gesture; no one could more  dexterously intimate a dangerous health without coming under the penal  statutes; and, above all, none drank success to the cause more deeply  and devoutly. But, on the approach of the Highland army in 1745,  it would appear that the worthy baronet's zeal became a little more  moderate just when its warmth was of most consequence. He talked much,  indeed, of taking the field for the rights of Scotland and Charles  Stuart; but his demi-pique saddle would suit only one of his horses;  and that horse could by no means be brought to stand fire. Perhaps  the worshipful owner sympathized in the scruples of this sagacious  quadruped, and began to think, that what was so much dreaded by the  horse could not be very wholesome for the rider. At any rate, while Sir  Anthony Wardour talked, and drank, and hesitated, the"]]]
