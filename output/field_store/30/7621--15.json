Enoch Crosby has for years been a faithful and  unrequited servant of his country. Though man does not, God may reward  him for his conduct. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"    Associated with Crosby in his work of getting information from the enemy  was a man named Gainos, who kept an inn on the neutral ground, that was  often raided. Being assailed by Cowboys once, Gainos, with his tenant and  stable-boys, fired at the bandits together, just as the latter had forced  his front door, then stepping quickly forward he slashed off the head of  the leader with a cutlass. The retreating crew dumped the body into a  well on the premises, and there it sits on the crumbling curb o' nights  looking disconsolately for its head.    It may also be mentioned that the Skinners had a chance to revenge  themselves on the Cowboys for their defeat at the Crosby house. They fell  upon the latter at the tent-shaped cave in Yonkers,--it is called  Washington's Cave, because the general napped there on bivouac,--and not  only routed them, but secured so much of their treasure that they were  able to be honest for several years after.          THE LOST GRAVE OF PAINE    Failure to mark the resting-places of great men and to indicate the  scenes of their deeds has led to misunderstanding and confusion among  those who discover a regard for history and tradition in this practical  age. Robert Fulton, who made steam navigation possible, lies in an  unmarked tomb in the yard of Trinity Church--the richest church in  America. The stone erected to show where Andre was hanged was destroyed  by a cheap patriot, who thought it represented a compliment to the spy.  The spot where Alexander Hamilton was shot in the duel by Aaron Burr is  known to few and will soon be forgotten. It was not until a century of  obloquy had been heaped on the memory of Thomas Paine that his once  enemies were brought to know him as a statesman of integrity, a  philanthropist, and philosopher. His deistic religion, proclaimed in \"The  Age of Reason,\" is unfortunately no whit more independent than is  preached in dozens of pulpits to-day. He died ripe in honors, despite his  want of creed, and his mortal part was buried in New Rochelle, New York,  under a large walnut-tree in a hay-field. Some years later his friends  removed the body to a new grave in higher ground, and placed over it a  monument that the opponents of his principles quickly hacked to pieces.  Around the original grave there still remains a part of the old  inclosure, and it was proposed to erect a suitable memorial--the Hudson  and its Hills the spot, but the owner of the tract would neither give nor  sell an inch of his land for the purpose of doing honor to the man. Some  doubt has already been expressed as to whether the grave is beneath the  monument or in the inclosure; and it is also asserted that Paine's ghost  appears at intervals, hovering in the air between the two burial-places,  or flitting back and forth from one to the other, lamenting the  forgetfulness of men and wailing, \"Where is my grave? I have lost my  grave!\"          THE RISING OF GOUVERNEUR MORRIS    Gouverneur Morris, American minister to the court of Louis XVI, was  considerably enriched, at the close of the reign of terror, by plate,  jewels, furniture, paintings, coaches, and so on, left in his charge by  members of the French nobility, that they might not be confiscated in the  sack of the city by the _sans culottes_; for so many of the aristocracy  were killed and so many went into exile or disguised their names, that it  was impossible to find heirs or owners for these effects. Some of the  people who found France a good country to be out of came to America,  where adventurers had found prosperity and refugees found peace so many  times before. Marshal Ney and Bernadotte are alleged to have served in  the American army during the Revolution, and at Hogansburg, New York, the  Reverend Eleazer Williams, an Episcopal missionary, who lies buried in  the church-yard there, was declared to be the missing son of Louis XVI.  The question, \"Have we a Bourbon among us?\" was frequently canvassed; but  he avoided publicity and went quietly on with his pastoral work.    All property left in Mr. Morris's hands that had not been claimed was  removed to his mansion at Port Morris, when he returned from his  ministry, and he gained in the esteem and envy of his neighbors when the  extent of these riches was seen. Once, at the wine, he touched glasses  with his wife, and said that if she bore a male child that son should be  heir to his wealth. Two relatives who sat at the table exchanged looks at  this and cast a glance of no gentle regard on his lady. A year went by.  The son was born, but Gouverneur Morris was dead.    It is the first night of the year 1817, the servants are asleep, and the  widow sits late before the fire, her baby in her arms, listening betimes  to the wind in the chimney, the beat of hail on the shutters, the  brawling of the Bronx and the clash of moving ice upon it; yet thinking  of her husband and the sinister look his promise had brought to the faces  of his cousins, when a tramp of horses is heard without, and anon a  summons at the door. The panels are beaten by loaded riding-whips, and a  man's voice cries, \"Anne Morris, fetch us our cousin's will, or we'll  break into the house and take it.\" The woman clutches the infant to her  breast, but makes no answer. Again the clatter of the whips; but now a  mist is gathering in the room, and a strange enchantment comes over her,  for are not the lions breathing on the coat of arms above the door, and  are not the portraits stirring in their frames?    They are, indeed. There is a rustle of robes and clink of steel and one  old warrior leaps down, his armor sounding as he alights, and striking  thrice his sword and shield together he calls on Gouverneur Morris to  come forth. Somebody moves in the room where Morris died; there is a  measured footfall in the corridor, with the clank of a scabbard keeping  time; the door is opened, and on the blast that enters the widow hears a  cry, then a double gallop, passing swiftly into distance. As she gazes,  her husband appears, apparelled as in life, and with a smile he takes a  candelabrum from the mantel and, beckoning her to follow, moves from room  to room. Then, for the first time, the widow knows to what wealth her  baby has been born, for the ghost discloses secret drawers in escritoires  where money, title deeds, and gems are hidden, turns pictures and  wainscots on unsuspected hinges, revealing shelves heaped with fabrics,  plate, and lace; then, returning to the fireside, he stoops as if to kiss  his wife and boy, but a bell strikes the first hour of morning and he  vanishes into his portrait on the wall.          THE ISLE OF MANHATTOES AND NEARBY          DOLPH HEYLIGER    New York was New Amsterdam when Dolph Heyliger got himself born there,--a  graceless scamp, though a brave, good-natured one, and being left  penniless on his father's death he was fain to take service with a  doctor, while his mother kept a shop. This doctor had bought a farm on  the island of Manhattoes--away out of town, where Twenty-third Street now  runs, most likely--and, because of rumors that its tenants had noised  about it, he seemed likely to enjoy the responsibilities of landholding  and none of its profits. It suited Dolph's adventurous disposition that  he should be deputed to investigate the reason for these rumors, and for  three nights he kept his abode in the desolate old manor, emerging after  daybreak in a lax and pallid condition, but keeping his own counsel, to  the aggravation of the populace, whose ears were burning for his news.    Not until long after did he tell of the solemn tread that woke him in the  small hours, of his door softly opening, though he had bolted and locked  it, of a portly Fleming, with curly gray hair, reservoir boots, slouched  hat, trunk and doublet, who entered and sat in the arm-chair, watching  him until the cock crew. Nor did he tell how on the third night he  summoned courage, hugging a Bible and a catechism to his breast for  confidence, to ask the meaning of the visit, and how the Fleming arose,  and drawing Dolph after him with his eyes, led him downstairs, went  through the front door without unbolting it, leaving that task for the  trembling yet eager youth, and how, after he had proceeded to a disused  well at the bottom of the garden, he vanished from sight.    Dolph brooded long upon these things and dreamed of them in bed. He  alleged that it was in obedience to his dreams that he boarded a schooner  bound up the Hudson, without the formality of adieu to his employer, and  after being spilled ashore in a gale at the foot of Storm King, he fell  into the company of Anthony Vander Hevden, a famous landholder and  hunter, who achieved a fancy for Dolph as a lad who could shoot, fish,  row, and swim, and took him home with him to Albany. The Heer had  commodious quarters, good liquor, and a pretty daughter, and Dolph felt  himself in paradise until led to the room he was to occupy, for one of  the first things that he set eyes on in that apartment was a portrait of  the very person who had kept him awake for the worse part of three nights  at the bowerie in Manhattoes. He demanded to know whose picture it was,  and learned that it was that of Killian Vander Spiegel, burgomaster and  curmudgeon, who buried his money when the English seized New Amsterdam  and fretted himself to death lest it should be discovered. He remembered  that his mother had spoken of this Spiegel and that her father was the  miser's rightful heir, and it now appeared that he was one of Heyden's  forbears too. In his dream that night the Fleming stepped out of the  portrait, led him, as he had done before, to the well, where he smiled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#14)"],[1,"nt.  And he said:    \"O Shah, if ever I have done that which was good in thy sight, if ever  my hand have been of avail unto thee, recall now my benefits in the hour  of my need, and have pity upon my dire distress. Send unto me, I pray  thee, of the balm that is among thy treasures, that my son may be healed  by thy grace.\"    And Gudarz outstripped the whirlwind in his speed to bear unto the Shah  this message. But the heart of Kai Kaous was hardened, and he remembered  not the benefits he had received from Rustem, and he recalled only the  proud words that he had spoken before him. And he was afraid lest the  might of Sohrab be joined to that of his father, and that together they  prove mightier than he, and turn upon him. So he shut his ear unto the  cry of his Pehliva. And Gudarz bore back the answer of the Shah, and he  said:    \"The heart of Kai Kaous is flinty, and his evil nature is like to a  bitter gourd that ceaseth never to bear fruit. Yet I counsel thee, go  before him thyself, and see if peradventure thou soften this rock.\"    And Rustem in his grief did as Gudarz counselled, and turned to go  before the Shah, but he was not come before him ere a messenger overtook  him, and told unto him that Sohrab was departed from the world. Then  Rustem set up a wailing such as the earth hath not heard the like of,  and he heaped reproaches upon himself, and he could not cease from  plaining the son that was fallen by his hands. And he cried continually:    \"I that am old have killed my son. I that am strong have uprooted this  mighty boy. I have torn the heart of my child, I have laid low the head  of a Pehliva.\"    Then he made a great fire, and flung into it his tent of many colours,  and his trappings of Roum, his saddle, and his leopard-skin, his armour  well tried in battle, and all the appurtenances of his throne. And he  stood by and looked on to see his pride laid in the dust. And he tore  his flesh, and cried aloud:    \"My heart is sick unto death.\"    Then he commanded that Sohrab be swathed in rich brocades of gold worthy  his body. And when they had enfolded him, and Rustem learned that the  Turanians had quitted the borders, he made ready his army to return unto  Zaboulistan. And the nobles marched before the bier, and their heads  were covered with ashes, and their garments were torn. And the drums of  the war-elephants were shattered, and the cymbals broken, and the tails  of the horses were shorn to the root, and all the signs of mourning were  abroad.    Now Zal, when he saw the host returning thus in sorrow, marvelled what  was come about; for he beheld Rustem at their head, wherefore he knew  that the wailing was not for his son. And he came before Rustem and  questioned him. And Rustem led him unto the bier and showed unto him the  youth that was like in feature and in might unto Saum the son of  Neriman, and he told him all that was come to pass, and how this was his  son, who in years was but an infant, but a hero in battle. And Rudabeh  too came out to behold the child, and she joined her lamentations unto  theirs. Then they built for Sohrab a tomb like to a horse's hoof, and  Rustem laid him therein in a chamber of gold perfumed with ambergris.  And he covered him with brocades of gold. And when it was done, the  house of Rustem grew like to a grave, and its courts were filled with  the voice of sorrow. And no joy would enter into the heart of Rustem,  and it was long before he held high his head.    Meantime the news spread even unto Turan, and there too did all men  grieve and weep for the child of prowess that was fallen in his bloom.  And the King of Samengan tore his vestments, but when his daughter  learned it she was beside herself with affliction. And Tahmineh cried  after her son, and bewailed the evil fate that had befallen him, and she  heaped black earth upon her head, and tore her hair, and wrung her  hands, and rolled on the ground in her agony. And her mouth was never  weary of plaining. Then she caused the garments of Sohrab to be brought  unto her, and his throne and his steed. And she regarded them, and  stroked the courser and poured tears upon his hoofs, and she cherished  the robes as though they yet contained her boy, and she pressed the head  of the palfrey unto her breast, and she kissed the helmet that Sohrab  had worn. Then with his sword she cut off the tail of his steed and set  fire unto the house of Sohrab, and she gave his gold and jewels unto the  poor. And when a year had thus rolled over her bitterness, the breath  departed from out her body, and her spirit went forth after Sohrab her  son.          CHAPTER VI    THE SEVEN SLEEPERS OF EPHESUS      One of the most picturesque myths of ancient days is that told by  Jacques de Voragine, in his \"Legenda Aurea\":    \"The seven sleepers were natives of Ephesus. The Emperor Decius, who  persecuted the Christians, having come to Ephesus, ordered the erection  of temples in the city, that all might come and sacrifice before him;  and he commanded that the Christians should be sought out and given  their choice, either to worship the idols, or to die. So great was the  consternation in the city, that the friend denounced his friend, the  father his son, and the son his father.    \"Now there were in Ephesus seven Christians, Maximian, Malchus, Marcian,  Dionysius, John, Serapion, and Constantine by name. These refused to  sacrifice to the idols, and remained in their houses praying and  fasting. They were accused before Decius, and they confessed themselves  to be Christians. However, the Emperor gave them a little time to  consider what line they would adopt. They took advantage of this  reprieve to dispense their goods among the poor, and they retired, all  seven, to Mount Celion, where they determined to conceal themselves.    \"One of their number, Malchus, in the disguise of a physician, went to  the town to obtain victuals. Decius, who had been absent from Ephesus  for a little while, returned, and gave orders for the seven to be  sought. Malchus, having escaped from the town, fled, full of fear, to  his comrades, and told them of the Emperor's fury. They were much  alarmed; and Malchus handed them the loaves he had bought, bidding them  eat, that, fortified by the food, they might have courage in the time of  trial. They ate, and then, as they sat weeping and speaking to one  another, by the will of God they fell asleep.    \"The pagans sought everywhere, but could not find them, and Decius was  greatly irritated at their escape. He had their parents brought before  him, and threatened them with death if they did not reveal the place of  concealment; but they could only answer that the seven young men had  distributed their goods to the poor, and that they were quite ignorant  as to their whereabouts.    \"Decius, thinking it possible that they might be hiding in a cavern,  blocked up the mouth with stones, that they might perish of hunger.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Three hundred and sixty years passed, and in the thirtieth year of the  reign of Theodosius, there broke forth a heresy denying the resurrection  of the dead.    \"Now, it happened that an Ephesian was building a stable on the side of  Mount Celion, and finding a pile of stones handy, he took them for his  edifice, and thus opened the mouth of the cave. Then the seven sleepers  awoke, and it was to them as if they had slept but a single night. They  began to ask Malchus what decision Decius had given concerning them.    \"'He is going to hunt us down, so as to force us to sacrifice to the  idols,' was his reply. 'God knows,' replied Maximian, 'we shall never do  that.' Then exhorting his companions, he urged Malchus to go back to the  town to buy some more bread, and at the same time to obtain fresh  information. Malchus took five coins and left the cavern. On seeing the  stones he was filled with astonishment; however, he went on toward the  city; but what was his bewilderment, on approaching the gate, to see  over it a cross! He went to another gate, and there he beheld the same  sacred sign; and so he observed it over each gate of the city. He  believed that he was suffering from the effects of a dream. Then he  entered Ephesus, rubbing his eyes, and he walked to a baker's shop. He  heard people using our Lord's name, and he was the more perplexed.  'Yesterday, no one dared pronounce the name of Jesus, and now it is on  every one's lips. Wonderful! I can hardly believe myself to be in  Ephesus.' He asked a passer-by the name of the city, and on being told  that it was Ephesus, he was thunderstruck. Now he entered a baker's  shop, and laid down his money. The baker, examining the coin, inquired  whether he had found a treasure, and began to whisper to some others in  the shop. The youth, thinking that he was discovered, and that they were  about to conduct him to the emperor, implored them to let him alone,  offering to leave loaves and money if he might only be suffered to  escape. But the shop-men seizing him, said, 'Whoever you are, you have  found a treasure; show us where it is, that we may share it with you,  and then we will hide you.' Malchus was too frightened to answer. So  they put a rope round his neck, and drew him through the streets into  the marketplace. The news soon spread that the young man had discovered  a great treasure, and there was presently a vast crowd about him. He  stoutly protested his innocence. No one recognised him, and his eyes,  ranging over the faces which surrounded him, could not see one which he  had known, or which was in the slightest degree familiar to him.    \"St. Martin, the bishop, and Antipater, the governor, having heard of  the excitement, ordered the young man to be brought before them, along  with the bakers.    \"The bishop and the governor asked him where he had found the treasure,  and he replied that he had found none, but that the few coins were from  his own purse."]]]
