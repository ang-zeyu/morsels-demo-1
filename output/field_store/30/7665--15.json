'But--but do you  think it did Edward good?'    'Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?' asked Mr. Murdstone, gravely.    'That's the point,' said his sister.    To this my mother returned, 'Certainly, my dear Jane,' and said no more.    I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue,  and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.    'Now, David,' he said--and I saw that cast again as he said it--'you  must be far more careful today than usual.' He gave the cane another  poise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it,  laid it down beside him, with an impressive look, and took up his book.    This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I felt  the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,  but by the entire page; I tried to lay hold of them; but they seemed,  if I may so express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me  with a smoothness there was no checking.    We began badly, and went on worse. I had come in with an idea of  distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared;  but it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book was added to  the heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the  time. And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he  made it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying.    'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.    'I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,' said my mother.    I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up  the cane:    'Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness,  the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today. That would be  stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we can hardly  expect so much from her. David, you and I will go upstairs, boy.'    As he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss Murdstone  said, 'Clara! are you a perfect fool?' and interfered. I saw my mother  stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.    He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely--I am certain he had a  delight in that formal parade of executing justice--and when we got  there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.    'Mr. Murdstone! Sir!' I cried to him. 'Don't! Pray don't beat me! I have  tried to learn, sir, but I can't learn while you and Miss Murdstone are  by. I can't indeed!'    'Can't you, indeed, David?' he said. 'We'll try that.'    He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped  him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. It was only a moment  that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards, and in  the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth,  between my teeth, and bit it through. It sets my teeth on edge to think  of it.    He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all the  noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out--I  heard my mother crying out--and Peggotty. Then he was gone; and the  door was locked outside; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn, and  sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.    How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness  seemed to reign through the whole house! How well I remember, when my  smart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel!    I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled  up from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and  ugly that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and  made me cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I  felt. It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious  criminal, I dare say.    It had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been lying,  for the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,  and looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone  came in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon the  table without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,  and then retired, locking the door after her.    Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else would  come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and  went to bed; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be done  to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed? Whether I  should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether I was at all  in danger of being hanged?    I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and  fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale  and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared before  I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to walk in  the garden for half an hour and no longer; and retired, leaving the door  open, that I might avail myself of that permission.    I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five  days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on  my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss  Murdstone excepted, during the whole time--except at evening prayers in  the parlour; to which I was escorted by Miss Murdstone after everybody  else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all alone by  myself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by my jailer,  before any one arose from the devotional posture. I only observed that  my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her face  another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was  bound up in a large linen wrapper.    The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one. They  occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which I listened  to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me;  the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the murmuring  of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing, whistling, or  singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in  my solitude and disgrace--the uncertain pace of the hours, especially  at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and find that the  family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of night had  yet to come--the depressed dreams and nightmares I had--the return of  day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the churchyard,  and I watched them from a distance within the room, being ashamed to  show myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner--the  strange sensation of never hearing myself speak--the fleeting intervals  of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating and drinking,  and went away with it--the setting in of rain one evening, with a fresh  smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church,  until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom, and fear, and  remorse--all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead  of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance. On the  last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken  in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms in the dark,  said:    'Is that you, Peggotty?'    There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a  tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into  a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the  keyhole.    I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,  whispered: 'Is that you, Peggotty dear?'    'Yes, my own precious Davy,' she replied. 'Be as soft as a mouse, or the  Cat'll hear us.'    I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the  urgency of the case; her room being close by.    'How's mama, dear Peggotty? Is she very angry with me?'    I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was  doing on mine, before she answered. 'No. Not very.'    'What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear? Do you know?'    'School. Near London,' was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get her  to repeat it, for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat,  in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the  keyhole and put my ear there; and though her words tickled me a good  deal, I didn't hear them.    'When, Peggotty?'    'Tomorrow.'    'Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my  drawers?' which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.    'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Box.'    'Shan't I see mama?'    'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Morning.'    Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these  words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole  has ever been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert:  shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of  its own.    'Davy, dear. If I ain't been azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I  used to be. It ain't because I don't love you. Just as well and more, my  pretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for someone  else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening? Can you hear?'    'Ye-ye-ye-yes, Peggotty!' I sobbed.    'My own!' said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. 'What I want to say,  is. That you must never forget me. For I'll never forget you. And I'll  take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I won't  leave her. The day may come when she'll be glad to lay her poor head.  On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to you,  my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I'll--I'll--' Peggotty fell to  kissing the keyhole, as she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#14)"],[1," partnership,  because his own business worries him a good deal and we don't want to  bother him with ours till it's settled, and then we shall give him half  our share.'    The old gentleman took off his spectacles and rumpled his hair with his  hands, then he said, 'Then what _did_ you come for?'    'We saw your advertisement,' Dicky said, 'and we want a hundred pounds  on our note of hand, and my sister came so that there should be both  kinds of us; and we want it to buy a partnership with in the lucrative  business for sale of useful patent. No personal attendance necessary.'    'I don't think I quite follow you,' said the G. B. 'But one thing I  should like settled before entering more fully into the matter: why did  you call me Generous Benefactor?'    'Well, you see,' said Alice, smiling at him to show she wasn't  frightened, though I know really she was, awfully, 'we thought it was so  _very_ kind of you to try to find out the poor people who want money and  to help them and lend them your money.'    'Hum!' said the G. B. 'Sit down.'    He cleared the clocks and vases and candlesticks off some of the chairs,  and we sat down. The chairs were velvety, with gilt legs. It was like a  king's palace.    'Now,' he said, 'you ought to be at school, instead of thinking about  money. Why aren't you?'    We told him that we should go to school again when Father could manage  it, but meantime we wanted to do something to restore the fallen  fortunes of the House of Bastable. And we said we thought the lucrative  patent would be a very good thing. He asked a lot of questions, and we  told him everything we didn't think Father would mind our telling, and  at last he said--    'You wish to borrow money. When will you repay it?'    'As soon as we've got it, of course,' Dicky said.    Then the G. B. said to Oswald, 'You seem the eldest,' but I explained to  him that it was Dicky's idea, so my being eldest didn't matter. Then he  said to Dicky--'You are a minor, I presume?'    Dicky said he wasn't yet, but he had thought of being a mining engineer  some day, and going to Klondike.    'Minor, not miner,' said the G. B. 'I mean you're not of age?'    'I shall be in ten years, though,' said Dicky. 'Then you might repudiate  the loan,' said the G. B., and Dicky said 'What?'    Of course he ought to have said 'I beg your pardon. I didn't quite catch  what you said'--that is what Oswald would have said. It is more polite  than 'What.'    'Repudiate the loan,' the G. B repeated. 'I mean you might say you would  not pay me back the money, and the law could not compel you to do so.'    'Oh, well, if you think we're such sneaks,' said Dicky, and he got  up off his chair. But the G. B. said, 'Sit down, sit down; I was only  joking.'    Then he talked some more, and at last he said--'I don't advise you to  enter into that partnership. It's a swindle. Many advertisements are.  And I have not a hundred pounds by me to-day to lend you. But I will  lend you a pound, and you can spend it as you like. And when you are  twenty-one you shall pay me back.'    'I shall pay you back long before that,' said Dicky. 'Thanks, awfully!  And what about the note of hand?'    'Oh,' said the G. B., 'I'll trust to your honour. Between gentlemen, you  know--and ladies'--he made a beautiful bow to Alice--'a word is as good  as a bond.'    Then he took out a sovereign, and held it in his hand while he talked  to us. He gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business  too young, and about doing our lessons--just swatting a bit, on our own  hook, so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school. And  all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he  thought it very beautiful. And so it was, for it was a new one. Then at  last he held it out to Dicky, and when Dicky put out his hand for it the  G. B. suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket.    'No,' he said, 'I won't give you the sovereign. I'll give you fifteen  shillings, and this nice bottle of scent. It's worth far more than the  five shillings I'm charging you for it. And, when you can, you shall pay  me back the pound, and sixty per cent interest--sixty per cent, sixty  per cent.'    'What's that?' said H. O.    The G. B. said he'd tell us that when we paid back the sovereign, but  sixty per cent was nothing to be afraid of. He gave Dicky the money. And  the boy was made to call a cab, and the G. B. put us in and shook hands  with us all, and asked Alice to give him a kiss, so she did, and H. O.  would do it too, though his face was dirtier than ever. The G. B. paid  the cabman and told him what station to go to, and so we went home.    That evening Father had a letter by the seven-o'clock post. And when  he had read it he came up into the nursery. He did not look quite so  unhappy as usual, but he looked grave.    'You've been to Mr Rosenbaum's,' he said.    So we told him all about it. It took a long time, and Father sat in the  armchair. It was jolly. He doesn't often come and talk to us now. He has  to spend all his time thinking about his business. And when we'd told  him all about it he said--    'You haven't done any harm this time, children; rather good than harm,  indeed. Mr Rosenbaum has written me a very kind letter.'    'Is he a friend of yours, Father?' Oswald asked. 'He is an  acquaintance,' said my father, frowning a little, 'we have done some  business together. And this letter--' he stopped and then said: 'No;  you didn't do any harm to-day; but I want you for the future not to do  anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting  me, that's all. I don't want to interfere with your plays and pleasures;  but you will consult me about business matters, won't you?'    Of course we said we should be delighted, but then Alice, who was  sitting on his knee, said, 'We didn't like to bother you.'    Father said, 'I haven't much time to be with you, for my business takes  most of my time. It is an anxious business--but I can't bear to think of  your being left all alone like this.'    He looked so sad we all said we liked being alone. And then he looked  sadder than ever.    Then Alice said, 'We don't mean that exactly, Father. It is rather  lonely sometimes, since Mother died.'    Then we were all quiet a little while. Father stayed with us till we  went to bed, and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful. So we  told him so, and he said--    'Well, the fact is, that letter took a weight off my mind.' I can't  think what he meant--but I am sure the G. B. would be pleased if he  could know he had taken a weight off somebody's mind. He is that sort of  man, I think.    We gave the scent to Dora. It is not quite such good scent as we thought  it would be, but we had fifteen shillings--and they were all good, so is  the G. B.    And until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as  though our fortunes had been properly restored. You do not notice your  general fortune so much, as long as you have money in your pocket. This  is why so many children with regular pocket-money have never felt  it their duty to seek for treasure. So, perhaps, our not having  pocket-money was a blessing in disguise. But the disguise was quite  impenetrable, like the villains' in the books; and it seemed still more  so when the fifteen shillings were all spent. Then at last the others  agreed to let Oswald try his way of seeking for treasure, but they were  not at all keen about it, and many a boy less firm than Oswald would  have chucked the whole thing. But Oswald knew that a hero must rely on  himself alone. So he stuck to it, and presently the others saw their  duty, and backed him up.        CHAPTER 10. LORD TOTTENHAM    Oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character, and he had never  wavered from his first idea. He felt quite certain that the books were  right, and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an  old gentleman in distress. Then he brings you up as his own son: but  if you preferred to go on being your own father's son I expect the old  gentleman would make it up to you some other way. In the books the least  thing does it--you put up the railway carriage window--or you pick up  his purse when he drops it--or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you  to, and then your fortune is made.    The others, as I said, were very slack about it, and did not seem to  care much about trying the rescue. They said there wasn't any deadly  peril, and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old  gentleman from it, but Oswald didn't see that that mattered. However, he  thought he would try some of the easier ways first, by himself.    So he waited about the station, pulling up railway carriage windows for  old gentlemen who looked likely--but nothing happened, and at last the  porters said he was a nuisance. So that was no go. No one ever asked him  to say a hymn, though he had learned a nice short one, beginning 'New  every morning'--and when an old gentleman did drop a two-shilling piece  just by Ellis's the hairdresser's, and Oswald picked it up, and was  just thinking what he should say when he returned it, the old gentleman  caught him by the collar and called him a young thief. It would have  been very unpleasant for Oswald if he hadn't happened to be a very  brave boy, and knew the policeman on that beat very well indeed. So the  policeman backed him up, and the old gentleman said he was sorry, and  offered Oswald sixpence. Oswald refused it with polite disdain, and  nothing more happened at all.    When Oswald had tried by himself and it had not come off, he said to the  others, 'We're wasting our time, not trying to rescue the old gentleman  in deadly peril. Come--buck up! Do let's do something!'    It was dinner-time, and Pincher was going round getting the bits off  the plates. There were plenty because it was cold-mutton day. And Alice  said--    'It's only fair to try"]]]
