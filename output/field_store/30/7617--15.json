I have been a very naughty  girl,\" she exclaimed, bursting into tears, and sobbing violently. \"I  disobeyed you, papa. I--I have been in the meadow.\"    \"Is it possible! Would you _dare_ to do so when I so positively forbade  it only the other day?\" he said in his sternest tone, while a dark  frown gathered on his brow. \"Elsie, I shall have to punish you.\"    \"I did not intend to disobey you, papa,\" she sobbed; \"I quite forgot  that you had forbidden me to go there.\"    \"That is no excuse, no excuse at all,\" said he severely; \"You must  _remember_ my commands; and if your memory is so poor I shall find  means to strengthen it.\"    He paused a moment, still looking sternly at the little, trembling,  sobbing girl at his side; then asked, \"What were you doing in the  meadow? tell me the whole story, that I may understand just how  severely I ought to punish you.\"    Elsie gave him all the particulars; and when, upon questioning her  closely, he perceived how entirely voluntary her confession had been,  his tone and manner became less stern, and he said quite mildly, \"Well,  Elsie, I shall not be very severe with you this time, as you seem to be  very penitent, and have made so full and frank a confession; but beware  how you disobey me again, for you will not escape so easily another  time; and remember I will not take forgetfulness as any excuse. Go now  to Aunt Chloe, and tell her from me that she is to put you immediately  to bed.\"    \"It is only the middle of the afternoon, papa,\" said Elsie,  deprecatingly.    \"If it were much _earlier_, Elsie, it would make no difference; you  must go at once to your bed, and stay there until to-morrow morning.\"    \"What will Lucy and Herbert think when they come in and can't find me,  papa?\" she said, weeping afresh.    \"You should have thought of that before you disobeyed me,\" he answered  very gravely. \"If you are hungry,\" he added, \"you may ask Chloe to get  you a slice of bread or a cracker for your supper, but you can have  nothing else.\"    Elsie lingered, looking timidly up into his face as though wanting to  say something, but afraid to venture.    \"Speak, Elsie, if you have anything more to say,\" he said encouragingly.    \"Dear papa, I am _so_ sorry I have been so naughty,\" she murmured,  leaning her head against the arm of his chair, while the tears rolled  fast down her cheeks; \"won't you please forgive me, papa? it seems to  me I can't go to sleep to-night if you are angry with me.\"    He seemed quite touched by her penitence. \"Yes, Elsie,\" he said, \"I do  forgive you. I am not at all angry with you now, and you may go to  sleep in peace. Good night, my little daughter,\" and he bent down and  pressed his lips to her brow.    Elsie held up her face for another, and he kissed her lips.    \"Good night, dear papa,\" she said, \"I hope I shall never be such a  naughty girl again.\" And she went to her room, made almost happy by  that kiss of forgiveness.    Elsie was up quite early the next morning and had learned all her  lessons before breakfast. As she came down the stairs she saw, through  the open door, her papa standing with some of the men-servants,  apparently gazing at some object lying on the ground. She ran out and  stood on the steps of the portico, looking at them and wondering what  they were doing.    Presently her father turned round, and seeing her, held out his hand,  calling, \"Come here, Elsie.\"    She sprang quickly down the steps, and running to him, put her hand in  his, saying, \"Good morning, papa.\"    \"Good morning, daughter,\" said he, \"I have something to show you.\"    And leading her forward a few paces, he pointed to a large rattlesnake  lying there.    \"O papa!\" she cried, starting back and clinging to him.    \"It will not hurt you _now_\" he said; \"it is dead; the men killed it  this morning _in the meadow_. Do you see _now_ why I forbade you to go  there?\"    \"O papa!\" she murmured, in a low tone of deep feeling, laying her cheek  affectionately against his hand, \"I might have lost my life by my  disobedience. How good God was to take care of me! Oh! I hope I shall  never be so naughty again.\"    \"I hope not,\" said he gravely, but not unkindly; \"and I hope that you  will always, after this, believe that your father has some good reason  for his commands, even although he may not choose to explain it to you.\"    \"Yes, papa, I think I will,\" she answered, humbly.    The breakfast-bell had rung, and he now led her in and seated her at  the table.    Lucy Carrington looked curiously at her, and soon took an opportunity  to whisper, \"Where were you last night, Elsie? I couldn't find you, and  your papa wouldn't say what had become of you, though I am quite sure  he knew.\"    \"I'll tell you after breakfast,\" replied Elsie, blushing deeply.    Lucy waited rather impatiently until all had risen from the table, and  then, putting her arm round Elsie's waist, she drew her out on to the  veranda, saying, \"now, Elsie, tell me; you know you promised.\"    \"I was in bed,\" replied Elsie, dropping her eyes, while the color  mounted to her very hair.    \"In bed! before five o'clock!\" exclaimed Lucy in a tone of  astonishment. \"Why, what was that for?\"    \"Papa sent me,\" replied Elsie, with an effort. \"I had been naughty, and  disobeyed him.\"    \"Why, how strange! Do tell me what you had done!\" exclaimed Lucy, with  a face full of curiosity.    \"Papa had forbidden me to go into the meadow, I forgot all about it,  and ran in there to get Herbert's arrow for him,\" replied Elsie,  looking very much ashamed.    \"Was _that all?_ why _my_ papa wouldn't have punished me for that,\"  said Lucy. \"He might have scolded me a little if I had done it on  purpose, but if I had told him I had forgotten, he would only have  said, 'You must remember better next time.'\"    \"Papa says that forgetfulness is no excuse; that I am to remember his  commands, and if I forget, he will have to punish me, to make me  remember better next time,\" said Elsie.    \"He must be very strict indeed; I'm glad he is not _my_ papa,\" replied  Lucy, in a tone of great satisfaction.    \"Come, little girls, make haste and get ready; we are to start in half  an hour,\" said Adelaide Dinsmore, calling to them from the hall door.    The whole family, old and young, including visitors, were on that day  to go on a picnic up the river, taking their dinner along, and spending  the day in the woods. They had been planning this excursion for several  days, and the children especially had been looking forward to it with a  great deal of pleasure.    \"Am I to go, Aunt Adelaide? did papa say so?\" asked Elsie anxiously, as  she and Lucy hastened to obey the summons.    \"I presume you are to go of course, Elsie; we have been discussing the  matter for the last three days, always taking it for granted that you  were to make one of the party, and he has never said you should not,\"  replied Adelaide, good-naturedly; \"so make haste, or you will be too  late. But here comes your papa now.\" she added, as the library door  opened, and Mr. Dinsmore stepped out into the hall where they were  standing.    \"Horace, Elsie is to go of course?\"    \"I do not see the _of course_, Adelaide,\" said he dryly. \"No; Elsie is  _not_ to go; she must stay at home and attend to her lessons as usual.\"    A look of keen disappointment came over Elsie's face, but she turned  away without a word and went upstairs; while Lucy, casting a look of  wrathful indignation at Mr. Dinsmore, ran after her, and following her  into her room, she put her arm round her neck, saying, \"Never mind,  Elsie; it's too bad, and I wouldn't bear it. I'd go in spite of him.\"    \"No, no, Lucy, I must obey my father; God says so; and besides, I  couldn't do that if I wanted to, for papa is stronger than I am, and  would punish me severely if I were to attempt such a thing,\" replied  Elsie hastily, brushing away a tear that _would_ come into her eye.    \"Then I'd coax him,\" said Lucy. \"Come, I'll go with you, and we will  both try.\"    \"No,\" replied Elsie, with a hopeless shake of the head, \"I have found  out already that my papa never breaks his word; and nothing could  induce him to let me go, now that he has once said I should not. But  you will have to leave me, Lucy, or you will be too late.\"    \"Good-bye, then,\" said Lucy, turning to go; \"but I think it is a great  shame, and I shan't half enjoy myself without you.\"    \"Well now, Horace, I think you might let the child go,\" was Adelaide's  somewhat indignant rejoinder to her brother, as the two little girls  disappeared; \"I can't conceive what reason you can have for keeping her  at home, and she looks so terribly disappointed. Indeed, Horace, I am  sometimes half inclined to think you take pleasure in thwarting that  child.\"    \"You had better call me a tyrant at once, Adelaide,\" said he angrily,  and turning very red; \"but I must beg to be permitted to manage my own  child in my own way; and I cannot see that I am under any obligation to  give my reasons either to you or to any one else.\"    \"Well, if you did not intend to let her go, I think you might have said  so at first, and not left the poor child to build her hopes upon it,  only to be disappointed. I must say I think it was cruel.\"    \"Until this morning, Adelaide,\" he replied, \"I did intend to let her  go, for I expected to go myself; but I find I shall not be able to do  so, as I must meet a gentleman on business; and as I know that  accidents frequently occur to such pleasure parties, I don't feel  willing to let Elsie go, unless I could be there myself to take care of  her. Whether you believe it or not, it is really regard for my child's  safety, and _not_ cruelty,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#14)"],[1,"friendly villages, and when they  have all assembled the feast commences, and presents are distributed  to each visitor. The object of their meeting is then explained, and  the woman is brought forward, still carrying on her back the bones of  her late husband, which are now removed and placed in a covered box,  which is nailed or otherwise fastened to a post twelve feet high. Her  conduct as a faithful widow is next highly eulogized, and the ceremony  of her manumission is completed by one man powdering on her head the  down of birds and another pouring on it the contents of a bladder of  oil. She is then at liberty to marry again or lead a life of single  blessedness; but few of them, I believe, wish to encounter the risk  attending a second widowhood.    \"The men are condemned to a similar ordeal, but they do not bear it  with equal fortitude, and numbers fly to distant quarters to avoid the  brutal treatment which custom has established as a kind of religious  rite.\"    Perhaps a short review of some of the peculiar and salient points of  this narrative may be permitted. It is stated that the corpse is kept  nine days after death--certainly a long period of time, when it is  remembered that Indians as a rule endeavor to dispose of their dead as  soon as possible. This may be accounted for on the supposition that it  is to give the friends and relatives an opportunity of assembling,  verifying the death, and of making proper preparations for the  ceremony. With regard to the verification of the dead person, William  Sheldon [Footnote: Trans. Am. Antiq. Soc., 1820, vol. 1, p 377] gives  an account of a similar custom which was common among the Caraibs of  Jamaica, and which seems to throw some light upon the unusual  retention of deceased persons by the tribe in question, although it  must be admitted that this is mere hypothesis:    \"They had some very extraordinary customs respecting deceased persons.  When one of them died, it was necessary that all his relations should  see him and examine the body in order to ascertain that he died a  natural death. They acted so rigidly on this principle, that if one  relative remained who had not seen the body all the others could not  convince that one that the death was natural. In such a case the  absent relative considered himself as bound in honor to consider all  the other relatives as having been accessories to the death of the  kinsman, and did not rest until he had killed one of them to revenge  the death of the deceased. If a Caraib died in Martinico or Guadaloupe  and his relations lived in St. Vincents, it was necessary to summon  them to see the body, and several months sometime elapsed before it  could be finally interred. When a Caraib died he was immediately  painted all over with _roucou_, and had his mustachios and the  black streaks in his face made with a black paint, which was different  from that used in their lifetime. A kind of grave was then dug in the  _carbet_ where he died, about 4 feet square and 6 or 7 feet deep.  The body was let down in it, when sand was thrown in, which reached to  the knees, and the body was placed in it in a sitting posture,  resembling that in which they crouched round the fire or the table  when alive, with the elbows on the knees and the palms of the hands  against the cheeks. No part of the body touched the outside of the  grave, which was covered with wood and mats until all the relations  had examined it. When the customary examinations and inspections were  ended the hole was filled, and the bodies afterwards remained  undisturbed. The hair of the deceased was kept tied behind. In this  way bodies have remained several months without any symptoms of decay  or producing any disagreeable smell. The _roucou_ not only  preserved them from the sun, air, and insects during their lifetime,  but probably had the same effect after death. The arms of the Caraibs  were placed by them when they were covered over for inspection, and  they were finally buried with them.\"    Again, we are told that during the burning the by-standers are very  merry. This hilarity is similar to that shown by the Japanese at a  funeral, who rejoice that the troubles and worries of the world are  over for the fortunate dead. The plundering of strangers present, it  may be remembered, also took place among the Indians of the Carolinas.  As already mentioned on a preceding page, the cruel manner in which  the widow is treated seems to be a modification of the Hindoo suttee,  but if the account be true, it would appear that death might be  preferable to such torments.    It is interesting to note that in Corsica, as late as 1743, if a  husband died women threw themselves upon the widow and beat her  severely. Bruhier quaintly remarks that this custom obliged women to  take good care of their husbands.    George Gibbs, in Schoolcraft, [Footnote: Hist. Indian Tribes of the  United States, 1853, part iii, p. 112.]  states that among the Indians  of Clear Lake, California, \"the body is consumed upon a scaffold built  over a hole, into which the ashes are thrown and covered\"    According to Stephen Powers, [Footnote: Contrib. to N. A. Ethnol.,  1877, vol. iii, p. 169.] cremation was common among the Se-nel of  California. He thus relates it--    \"The dead are mostly burned. Mr. Willard described to me a scene of  incremation that be once witnessed which was frightful for its  exhibitions of fanatic frenzy and infatuation. The corpse was that of  a wealthy chieftain, and as he lay upon the funeral pyre they placed  in his mouth two gold twenties, and other smaller coins in his ears  and hands, on his breast, etc., besides all his finery, his feather  mantles, plumes, clothing, shell money, his fancy bows, painted  arrows, etc. When the torch was applied they set up a mournful  ululation, chanting and dancing about him, gradually working  themselves into a wild and ecstatic raving, which seemed almost a  demoniacal possession, leaping, howling, lacerating their flesh. Many  seemed to lose all self-control. The younger English-speaking Indians  generally lend themselves charily to such superstitious work,  especially if American spectators are present, but even they were  carried away by the old contagious frenzy of their race. One stripped  off a broadcloth coat, quite new and fine, and ran frantically yelling  and cast it upon the blazing-pile. Another rushed up and was about to  throw on a pile of California blankets, when a white man, to test his  sincerity, offered him $16 for them, jingling the bright coins before  his eyes, but the savage (for such he had become again for the  moment), otherwise so avaricious, hurled him away with a yell of  execration and ran and threw his offering into the flames. Squaws,  even more frenzied, wildly flung upon the pyre all they had in the  world--their dearest ornaments, their gaudiest dresses, their strings  of glittering shells. Screaming, wailing, tearing their hair, beating  their breasts in their mad and insensate infatuation, some of them  would have cast themselves bodily into the flaming ruins and perished  with the chief had they not been restrained by their companions. Then  the bright, swift flames with their hot tongues licked this 'cold  obstruction' into chemic change, and the once 'delighted spirit' of  the savage was borne up....    \"It seems as if the savage shared in Shakspeare's shudder at the  thought of rotting in the dismal grave, for it is the one passion of  his superstition to think of the soul of his departed friend set free  and purified by the swift purging heat of the flames, not dragged down  to be clogged and bound in the moldering body, but borne up in the  soft, warm chariots of the smoke toward the beautiful sun, to bask in  his warmth and light, and then, to fly away to the Happy Western Land.  What wonder if the Indian shrinks with unspeakable horror from the  thought of _burying his friend's soul!_--of pressing and ramming  down with pitiless clods that inner something which once took such  delight in the sweet light of the sun! What wonder if it takes years  to persuade him to do otherwise and follow our custom! What wonder if  even then he does it with sad fears and misgivings! Why not let him  keep his custom! In the gorgeous landscapes and balmy climate of  California and India incremation is as natural to the savage as it is  for him to love the beauty of the sun. Let the vile Esquimaux and the  frozen Siberian bury their dead if they will; it matters little, the  earth is the same above as below, or to them the bosom of the earth  may seem even the better; but in California do not blame the savage if  he recoils at the thought of going under ground! This soft, pale halo  of the lilac hills--ah, let him console himself if he will with the  belief that his lost friend enjoys it still! The narrator concluded by  saying that they destroyed full $500 worth of property. 'The  blankets,' said he with a fine Californian scorn of such absurd  insensibility to a good bargain, 'the blankets that the American  offered him $16 for were not worth half the money.'    \"After death the Se-nel hold that bad Indians return into coyotes.  Others fall off a bridge which all souls must traverse, or are hooked  off by a raging bull at the further end, while the good escape across.  Like the Yokaia and the Konkan, they believe it necessary to nourish  the spirits of the departed for the space of a year. This is generally  done by a squaw, who takes pinole in her blanket, repairs to the scene  of the incremation, or to places hallowed by the memory of the dead,  where she scatters it over the ground, meantime rocking her body  violently to and fro in a dance and chanting the following chorus:      Hel-lel-li-ly,    Hel-lel-lo,    Hel-lel-lu.    \"This refrain is repeated over and over indefinitely, but the words  have no meaning whatever.\"    Mr. Henry Gillman [Footnote: Amer. Natural,"]]]
