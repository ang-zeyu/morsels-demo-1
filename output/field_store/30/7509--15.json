The consul  Tiberius Coruncanius holds Etruria, again in agitation. Lastly, an army  of reserve guards the capital.    Laevinus encountered the King of Epirus near Heraclea, a colony of  Tarentum (474). Seven times in succession the legions charged the  phalanx, which was on the point of giving way, when the elephants,  animals unknown to the Romans, decided the victory in favour of the  enemy. A single battle had delivered to Pyrrhus all the south of the  Peninsula, where the Greek towns received him with enthusiasm.    But, though victor, he had sustained considerable losses, and learned at  the same time the effeminacy of the Greeks of Italy, and the energy of a  people of soldiers. He offered peace, and asked of the Senate liberty  for the Samnites, the Lucanians, and especially for the Greek towns. Old  Appius Claudius declared it impossible so long as Pyrrhus occupied  Italian soil, and peace was refused. The king then resolved to march  upon Rome through Campania, where his troops made great booty.    Laevinus, made prudent by his defeat, satisfied himself with watching the  enemy's army, and succeeded in covering Capua; whence he followed  Pyrrhus from place to place, looking out for a favourable opportunity.  This prince, advancing by the Latin Way, had reached Praeneste without  obstacle,[213] when, surrounded by three Roman armies, he found himself  under the necessity of falling back and retiring into Lucania. Next  year, reckoning on finding new auxiliaries among the peoples of the  east, he attacked Apulia; but the fidelity of the allies in Central  Italy was not shaken. Victorious at Asculum (_Ascoli di Satriano_)  (475), but without a decisive success, and encountering always the same  resistance, he seized the first opportunity of quitting Italy to conquer  Sicily (476-78). During this time, the Senate re-established the Roman  domination in Southern Italy, and even seized upon some of the Greek  towns, among the rest Locri and Heraclea.[214] Samnium, Lucania, and  Bruttium were again given up to the power of the legions, and forced to  surrender lands and renew treaties of alliance; on the coast, Tarentum  and Rhegium alone remained independent. The Samnites still resisted, and  the Roman army encamped in their country in 478 and 479. Meanwhile  Pyrrhus returns to Italy, reckoning on arriving in time to deliver  Samnium; but he is defeated at Beneventum by Curius Dentatus, and  returns to his country. The invasion of Pyrrhus, cousin of Alexander the  Great; and one of his successors, appears as one of the last efforts of  Grecian civilisation expiring at the feet of the rising grandeur of  Roman civilisation.    The war against the King of Epirus produced two remarkable results: it  improved the Romans in military tactics, and introduced between the  combatants those mutual regards of civilised nations which teach men to  honour their adversaries, to spare the vanquished, and to lay aside  wrath when the struggle is ended. The King of Epirus treated his Roman  prisoners with great generosity. Cineas, sent to the Senate at Rome, and  Fabricius, envoy to Pyrrhus, carried back from their mission a profound  respect for those whom they had combated.    In the following years Rome took Tarentum (482),[215] finally pacified  Samnium, and took possession of Rhegium (483-485). Since the battle of  Mount Gaurus, seventy-two years had passed, and several generations had  succeeded each other, without seeing the end of this long and sanguinary  quarrel. The Samnites had been nearly exterminated, and yet the spirit  of independence and liberty remained deeply rooted in their mountains.  When, at the end of two centuries and a half, the war of the allies  shall come, it is there still that the cause of equality of rights will  find its strongest support.    The other peoples underwent quickly the laws of the conqueror. The  inhabitants of Picenum, as a punishment for their revolt, were despoiled  of a part of their territory, and a certain number among them received  new lands in the south of Campania, near the Gulf of Salernum  (_Picentini_)(486). In 487, the submission of the Salentines allowed the  Romans to seize Brundusium, the most important port of the  Adriatic.[216] The Sarsinates were reduced the years following.[217]  Finally, Volsinium, a town of Etruria, was again numbered among the  allies of the Republic. The Sabines received the right of suffrage.  Italy, become henceforth Roman, extended from the Rubicon to the Straits  of Messina.      [Sidenote: Preponderance of Rome.]    X. During this period, the conquest of the subjugated countries was  ensured by the foundation of colonies. Rome became thus encircled by a  girdle of fortresses commanding all the passages which led to Latium,  and closing the roads to Campania, Samnium, Etruria, and Gaul.[218]    At the opening of the struggle which ended in the conquest of Italy,  there were only twenty-seven tribes of Roman citizens; the creation of  eight new tribes (the two last in 513) raised finally the number to  thirty-five, of which twenty-one were reserved to the old Roman people  and fourteen to the new citizens. Of these the Etruscans had four; the  Latins, the Volsci, the Ausones, the AEqui, and the Sabines, each two;  but, these tribes being at a considerable distance from the capital, the  new citizens could hardly take part in the comitia, and the majority,  with its influence, remained with those who dwelt at Rome.[219] After  513, no more tribes were created; those who received the rights of  citizens were only placed in the previously existing tribes; so that the  members of one individual tribe were scattered in the provinces, and the  number of those inscribed went on increasing continually by individual  additions, and by the tendency more and more apparent to raise the  municipia of the second order to the rank of the first order. Thus,  towards the middle of the sixth century, the towns of the AEqui, the  Hernici, the Volsci, and a part of those of Campania, including the  ancient Samnite cities of Venafrum and Allifae, obtained the right of  city with suffrage.    Rome, towards the end of the fifth century, thus ruled, though in  different degrees, the peoples of Italy proper. The Italian State, if we  may give it that name, was composed of a reigning class, the citizens;  of a class protected, or held in guardianship, the allies; and of a  third class, the subjects. Allies or subjects were all obliged to  furnish military contingents. The maritime Greek towns furnished sailors  to the fleet. Even the cities, which preserved their independence for  their interior affairs, obeyed, so far as the military administration  was concerned, special functionaries appointed by the metropolis.[220]  The consuls had the right of raising in the countries bordering on the  theatre of war all men capable of bearing arms. The equipment and pay of  the troops remained at the charge of the cities; Rome provided for their  maintenance during war. The auxiliary infantry was ordinarily equal in  number to that of the Romans, the cavalry double or triple.    In exchange for this military assistance, the allies had a right to a  part of the conquered territory, and, in return for an annual rent, to  the usufruct of the domains of the State. These domains, considerable in  the peninsula,[221] formed the sole source of income which the treasury  derived from the allies, free in other respects from tribute. Four  questors (_quaestores classici_) were established to watch over the  execution of the orders of the Senate, the equipment of the fleet, and  the collection of the farm-rents.    Rome reserved to herself exclusively the direction of the affairs of the  exterior, and presided alone over the destinies of the Republic. The  allies never interfered in the decisions of the Forum, and each town  kept within the narrow limits of its communal administration. The  Italian nationality was thus gradually constituted by means of this  political centralisation, without which the different peoples would have  mutually weakened each other by intestine wars, more ruinous than  foreign wars, and Italy would not have been in a condition to resist the  double pressure of the Gauls and the Carthaginians.    The form adopted by Rome to rule Italy was the best possible, but only  as a transition form. The object to be aimed at was, in fact, the  complete assimilation of all the inhabitants of the peninsula, and this  was evidently the aim of the wise policy of the Camilli and the Fabii.  When we consider that the colonies of citizens presented the faithful  image of Rome; that the Latin colonies had analogous institutions and  laws; and that a great number of Roman citizens and Latin allies were  dispersed, in the different countries of the peninsula, over the vast  territories ceded as the consequence of war, we may judge how rapid must  have been the diffusion of Roman manners and the Latin language.    If Rome, in later times, had not the wisdom to seize the favourable  moment in which assimilation, already effected in people's minds, might  have passed into the domain of facts, the reason of it was the  abandonment of the principles of equity which had guided the Senate in  the first ages of the Republic, and, above all, the corruption of the  magnates, interested in maintaining the inferior condition of the  allies. The right of city extended to all the peoples of Italy, time  enough to be useful, would have given to the Republic a new force; but  an obstinate refusal became the cause of the revolution commenced by the  Gracchi, continued by Marius, extinguished for a moment by Sylla, and  completed by Caesar.

If I were an unbeliever in the true Deity  of Christ, I might take up the gentleman's argument in this way: You  say God is a spirit, and hence bodiless, immaterial? His answer must  be, \"Yes.\" But Jesus says, \"a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye  see me have\"--hence Jesus is not God, because he is a personage of  flesh and bone, in the form of man--not bodiless or immaterial. This,  of course, is not _my_ point. I merely refer to it in the beaten way  of good fellowship, and by way of caution to my Catholic friend, who,  I am sure, in his way, is as anxious to maintain the true Deity of  the Nazarene as I am; but his method of handling the text, \"God is a  spirit,\" might lead him into serious difficulty in upholding the truth  that Jesus was and is true Deity, if in argument with an infidel.    But now for the \"Mormon\" exposition of the text. Is Jesus Christ God?  Was he God as he stood there among his disciples in his glorious and,  to use Mr. V.'s own word, \"sacred,\" resurrected body? There is but one  answer that the Reverend Catholic gentleman or any orthodox Protestant  can give, and that is in the affirmative--\"yes, Jesus is God.\"[A]  But \"God is a spirit!\" True, he is; but Jesus is a spirit inside a  body--inside an immortal, indestructible body of flesh and bone;  therefore, if Jesus is God, and God is a spirit, he is an embodied  spirit, just as the Latter-day Saints teach.    [Footnote A: \"His acts proved his Deity; Jesus is Jehovah, and  therefore we sing unto him as the Lord.\" \"Treasury of David\"  (Spurgeon). Vol. iv, p. 371.]    Now let it be understood that Latter-day Saints are not so foolish as  to believe that so much phosphate, lime, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen  as may compose the body of a perfected man, is God. They recognize the  fact that the body without the spirit is dead, being alone; but the  spirit having through natural processes gathered to itself a body, and  that body having been purified by the power of God--who has promised  in holy scripture that he will \"change our vile body, that it may  be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working  whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself\" (Phil.  3:20, 21)--when this is done, even the body takes upon it some of the  divine nature. It indeed becomes \"sacred,\" and something more than  \"sacred\"--it becomes incorporated with and forever united to, a spirit  that is divine, and henceforth becomes an integral part of God. Of  which process, of a divine spirit taking on a body of flesh and bone,  Jesus Christ is the most perfect example.    At this point, I shall pass for the present a few items that stand  next in order in Mr. Van Der Donckt's argument, that I may consider  some statements and arguments of his made further on in the \"Reply,\"  because they are immediately related to what has just been said. Mr. V.  holds that it is proved by Holy Writ that \"angels as well as God are  bodiless beings.\" After quoting passages of scripture in support of  this statement, he then adds: \"Could plainer words be found to teach  that angels, both good and bad, are spirits, devoid of bodies? Now, the  Creator is certainly more perfect than his creatures, and pure minds  are more perfect _than minds united to bodies_[A] (men).\" In support  of which he quotes the following: \"The corruptible body is a load upon  the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the mind\" (Wisdom  9:15)[B]; and Paul's saying, \"who shall deliver me from this body of  death?\"[C] (Rom. 6:24). _Therefore the Creator is a pure spirit._    [Footnote A: Italics are mine.]    [Footnote B: This is a book received by the Catholic Church on alleged  apostolical tradition, but not found in the Hebrew Bible nor Protestant  versions of the Bible.]    [Footnote C: Quoted thus by Mr. V. In both Catholic and Protestant  Bibles it stands: \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"]    I fear Mr. V. in these statements has run into more difficulty. Let us  see. According to his doctrine, \"Angels as well as God are bodiless  beings.\" \"Angels, both good and bad, are spirits, devoid of bodies. The  Creator is more perfect than his creatures, _and pure minds_ [minds  separated from bodies] _are more perfect than minds united to bodies_.  * * * Therefore the Creator is a pure spirit.\" But where does this  leave Jesus?    Was and is Jesus God--true Deity?    Yes.    But Jesus is a spirit and body united into one glorious personage. His  mind was and is now united to and dwelling in a body. Our Catholic  friend says, \"pure minds [i. e. minds not united to bodies] are more  perfect than minds united to bodies.\" He also says, \"Angels, both good  and bad, are spirits (i. e. minds) devoid of bodies.\" Therefore, it  must follow from his premises and argument that angels are superior to  Jesus since his spirit is united to a body, while they are minds _not_  united to bodies! I will not press the point, that the same conclusions  could be drawn from his premises and argument with reference even to  bad spirits, whom he says are bodiless, and hence, upon his theory,  superior to minds or spirits united to bodies, for that would be  ungenerous upon my part, and would lay upon his faulty argument the  imputation of awful blasphemy, which I am sure was not intended and  would be as revolting to him as it would be to myself. Mr. V., I am  sure, would contend as earnestly as I would that Jesus is superior to  the angels, though it is perfectly clear that he is a spirit united to  a body. \"When he had by himself purged our sins, [Jesus] sat down on  the right hand of the majesty on high; being made so much better than  the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name  than they. * * * And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten  into the world, he saith, and let all the angels of God worship him.  And of the angels he saith, who maketh his angels spirits, and his  ministers a flame of fire. _But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne,  O God, is for ever and ever_\" (Heb. 1:3-8). In this passage the  superiority of Jesus over the angels is manifested in four ways: first,  by the direct affirmation of God, that he was made \"better\" than the  angels; second, that by inheritance he obtained a more exalted name;  third, that the angels are commanded to worship him; fourth, God, the  Father, addressing Jesus, said, \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and  ever.\" In this passage the Father directly addresses Jesus by the  title \"God.\" And as God is exalted above all angels, Jesus must be  superior to angels, for he is \"God,\" if we may believe the words of the  Father--whom to disbelieve would be blasphemy.    Mr. Van Der Donckt admits in his argument,'of course, that Jesus is  God; and also admits the persistence of him in the physical condition  in which he left the earth with his resurrected body. For in explaining  the scripture passage about seeing God \"face to face,\" he remarks:          The first and chief element of the happiness of heaven will      consist in the beatific vision; that is, in seeing God face to      face, unveiled, as he really is. The \"face to face,\" however, is      literally true only of our blessed Savior, who ascended into heaven      with his sacred body. Otherwise, as God is a spirit, he has no      body, and, consequently, no face.    From this it is clear that, in the mind of the Reverend gentleman,  Jesus not only ascended into heaven with his \"sacred body,\" but now  dwells there spirit and body united; and the blessed, who shall inherit  heaven will see him there literally \"face to face.\"[A] Otherwise than  this \"face to face\" view of Jesus--according to Mr. V.--we shall only  see God, since he is a spirit, \"with the spiritual eye; with the soul's  intellectual perception, elevated by a supernatural influx from God!\"  This admission with reference to Jesus and his existence as an immortal  personage of flesh and bone, and our literal view of him in heaven  \"face to face,\" draws with it some consequences which my Catholic  friend evidently overlooked. In the creed usually named after St.  Athanasius, it is said: \"_Such as the Father is, such is the Son._\"  I take it that this, in the view of those who accept the Athanasian  creed, has reference to the \"substance of the Father,\" as well as to  other things pertaining to him; for, according to that creed, the  \"substance\" of the Father and Son is one and undivided. \"We worship  one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity,\" says the creed; \"neither  confounding the persons nor _dividing the substance_.\" It must be,  therefore, according to Mr. V.'s creed, that all the \"substance\" of God  there is, is in Jesus Christ, as well as the attributes of God. The  terms of the creed forbid us believing that part of the \"substance\"  of God was enclosed in the flesh and bone body of Jesus, and the  remainder existed outside of that body; for that would be dividing the  \"substance\" of God, a thing the Athanasian creed forbids: therefore,  all the \"substance\" of God inhabits the body of Jesus Christ, and he  is wholly God. In this view of the subject, there is no God except the  Deity enclosed in the flesh and body of Jesus Christ. But that would  place our Catholic friend--after all he has said about God being a  spirit, and about the superiority of pure minds (i. e. spirits not  united to bodies) over minds united to bodies--under the necessity  of accepting as God, the Supreme, the Almighty, a personage that is  a spirit and body united in one glorious personage, and in form like  man--a thing most abhorrent to our friend's principles.    [Footnote A: In an article for the _Improvement Era_, on the Doctrines  and Claims of the Catholic Church, Bishop Scanlan, of Salt Lake City,  also said of the Divinity of Christ; \"The Catholic Church teaches that  Jesus Christ is not a mere elect child or special creation of God,"]]]
