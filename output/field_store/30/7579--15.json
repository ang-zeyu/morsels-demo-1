In front of each of these two rows of pulpits, was a  sacrament table, for the administration of that sacred ordinance. In  each corner of the court was an elevated pew for the singers--the choir  being distributed into four compartments. In addition to the pulpit  curtains, were others, intersecting at right angles, which divided  the main ground-floor hall into four equal sections--giving to each  one-half of one set of pulpits.    From the day the ground was broken for laying the foundation for the  temple, until its dedication on the 27th of March, 1836, the work was  vigorously prosecuted.    With very little capital except brain, bone and sinew, combined with  unwavering trust in God, men, women, and even children, worked with  their might; while the brethren labored in their departments, the  sisters were actively engaged in boarding and clothing workmen not  otherwise provided for--all living as abstemiously as possible so  that every cent might be appropriated to the grand object, while  their energies were stimulated by the prospect of participating in  the blessing of a house built by the direction of the Most High and  accepted by him.    The dedication was looked forward to with intense interest; and  when the day arrived (Sunday, March 27th, 1836), a dense multitude  assembled--the temple was filled to its utmost, and when the ushers  were compelled to close the doors, the outside congregation was nearly  if not quite as large as that within.    Four hundred and sixteen elders, including prophets and apostles, with  the first great prophets of the last dispensation at their head, were  present--men who had been \"called of God as was Aaron,\" and clothed  with the holy priesthood; many of them having just returned from  missions, on which they had gone forth like the ancient disciples,  \"without purse or scrip,\" now to feast for a little season on the sweet  spirit of love and union, in the midst of those who had \"tasted of the  powers of the world to come.\"    At the hour appointed, the assembly was seated, the Melchisidec and  Aaronic priesthoods being arranged as follows: West end of the house,  Presidents Frederick G. Williams, Joseph Smith, Sr., and William W.  Phelps, occupied the first pulpit for the Melchisidec priesthood;  Presidents Joseph Smith, Jr., Hyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon, the  second; Presidents David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdry and John Whitmer,  the third; the fourth pulpit was occupied by the president of the  high-priest's quorum and his councilors, and two choristers. The twelve  apostles were on the right, in the highest three seats; the president  of the elders, his two councilors and clerk in the seat directly below  the twelve. The High Council of Kirtland, consisting of twelve, were on  the left, on the first three seats. The fourth seat, and next below the  High Council, was occupied by Warren A. Cowdry and Warren Parrish, who  officiated as scribes.    In the east end of the house, the Bishop of Kirtland--Newel K.  Whitney--and his councilors occupied the first pulpit for the Aaronic  priesthood; the Bishop of Zion--Edward Partridge--and his councilors,  the second; the President of the priests and his councilors, the third;  the President of the teachers, and his councilors, and one chorister,  the fourth; the High Council of Zion, consisting of twelve councilors,  on the right; the President of the deacons, and his councilors, in the  next seat below them, and the seven presidents of the seventies, on the  left.    At nine o'clock, President Sidney Rigdon commenced the services of that  great and memorable day, by reading the ninety-sixth and twenty-fourth  Psalms; \"Ere long the vail will be rent in twain,\" etc., was sung by  the choir, and after President Rigdon had addressed the throne of grace  in fervent prayer, \"O happy souls who pray,\" etc., was sung. President  Rigdon then read the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth verses of  the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, and spoke more particularly from  the last-named verse, continuing his eloquent, logical and sublime  discourse for two and a half hours. At one point, as he reviewed the  toils and privations of those who had labored in rearing the walls of  that sacred edifice, he drew tears from many eyes, saying, there were  those who had wet those walls with their tears, when, in the silent  shades of the night, they were praying to the God of heaven to protect  them, and stay the unhallowed hands of ruthless spoilers, who had  uttered a prophesy, when the foundation was laid, that the walls should  never be erected.    In reference to his main subject, the speaker assumed that in the days  of the Saviour there were synagogues where the Jews worshipped God;  and in addition to those, the splendid temple in Jerusalem; yet when,  on a certain occasion, one proposed to follow him, withersoever he  went, though heir of all things, he cried out in bitterness of soul,  \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the  Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.\" From this the speaker drew  the conclusion that the Most High did not put his name there, neither  did he accept the worship of those who paid their vows and adorations  there. This was evident from the fact that they did not receive the  Saviour, but thrust him from them, saying, \"Away with him! Crucify him!  Crucify him!\" It was therefore evident that his spirit did not dwell in  them. They were the degenerate sons of noble sires, but they had long  since slain the prophets and seers, through whom the Lord had revealed  himself to the children of men. They were not led by revelation. This,  said the speaker, was the grand difficulty--their unbelief in present  revelation. He then clearly demonstrated the fact that diversity of,  and contradictory opinions did, and would prevail among people not led  by present revelation; which forcibly applies to the various religious  sects of our own day; and inasmuch as they manifest the same spirit,  they must be under the same condemnation with those who were coeval  with the Saviour.    He admitted there were many houses--many sufficiently large, built  for the worship of God, but not one, except this, on the face of the  whole earth, that was built by divine revelation; and were it not for  this, the dear Redeemer might, in this day of science, intelligence and  religion, say to those who would follow him, \"The foxes have holes, the  birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay  his head.\"    After the close of his discourse, President Rigdon presented for  an expression of their faith and confidence, Joseph Smith, Jr., as  prophet, seer and revelator, to the various quorums, and the whole  congregation of saints, and a simultaneous rising up followed, in token  of unanimous confidence, and covenant to uphold him as such, by their  faith and prayers.    The morning services were concluded by the choir singing, \"Now let us  rejoice in the day of salvation,\" etc. During an intermission of twenty  minutes, the congregation remained seated, and the afternoon services  opened by singing, \"This earth was once a garden place,\" etc. President  Joseph Smith, Jr., addressed the assembly for a few moments, and then  presented the first presidency of the church as prophets, seers, and  revelators, and called upon all who felt to acknowledge them as such,  to manifest it by rising up. All arose. He then presented the twelve  apostles who were present, as prophets, seers, and revelators, and  special witnesses to all the earth, holding the keys of the kingdom  of God, to unlock it, or cause it to be done among them; to which all  assented by rising to their feet. He then presented the other quorums  in their order, and the vote was unanimous in every instance.    He then prophesied to all, that inasmuch as they would uphold these men  in their several stations (alluding to the different quorums in the  church), the Lord would bless them, \"yea, in the name of Christ, the  blessings of heaven shall be yours; and when the Lord's anointed shall  go forth to proclaim the word, bearing testimony to this generation,  if they receive it they shall be blest; but if not, the judgments of  God will follow close upon them, until that city or that house which  rejects them, shall be left desolate.\"    The hymn commencing with \"How pleased and blest was I,\" was sung, and  the following dedicatory prayer offered by the prophet, Joseph Smith:        \"Thanks be to thy name, O Lord God of Israel, who keepest covenant      and showest mercy unto thy servants who walk uprightly before thee,      with all their hearts; thou who hast commanded thy servants to      build a house to thy name in this place. And now thou beholdest, O      Lord, that thy servants have done according to thy commandment. And      now we ask thee, Holy Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the son      of thy bosom, in whose name alone salvation can be administered to      the children of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this house,      the workmanship of the hands of us, thy servants, which thou didst      command us to build; for thou knowest that we have done this work      through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we have given of      our substance, to build a house to thy name, that the Son of Man      might have a place to manifest himself to his people. And as thou      hast said in a revelation, given to us, calling us thy friends,      saying, 'call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded you; and      as all have not faith, seek ye diligently, and teach one another      words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books, words of      wisdom; seek learning even by study,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#14)"],[1," treacherous Greys), and the Governor being  at the same time in Nauvoo disarming the Nauvoo Legion, looks like a  very deep plot for the murder of those two innocent prisoners. What  makes it still more apparent that the State was guilty of this foul  deed, is the fact that not one of those who were immediately connected  with the murder were ever convicted, while many of them roamed at  large, although well known to the community as having taken part in the  murder, some even boasting of having participated in the vile act. One  man in particular, who lived in what was known as Morley's settlement,  near Carthage, openly claimed to have helped in the massacre.    While I was in St. George about two years ago I read from a record book  the following:    \"Mr. Meradis Perry, a near neighbor of ours, was one of the mob who  killed Joseph Smith. He came home from Carthage sick and begged my  father to kill him; 'for,' said he, 'I can neither eat nor sleep. When  I close my eyes I can see Joseph Smith before me; I am a miserable  man.' My father told him that he was in the hands of the Lord, and he  would deal with him as seemed good onto himself; that Joseph was a true  prophet sent of God, and his blood, with that of his brother, would  cry from Carthage jail against his murderers as did Able's against his  slayer. My father, James Bellows, lived near Morley's settlement.\"    The daughter of Jas. Bellows, who has the record named, vouches for the  above, having seen the mobber. She says he was a miserable human being.    The mob came from the woods, entered the stairway door, crowded  upstairs, and commenced pressing in the door where the prisoners were  confined. They were unable to open the door for a while, when shots  were fired through the door. All was commotion and confusion. A ball  passing through the door pierced Hyrum Smith on the side of his nose  just below the eye, when he fell prostrate on the floor, exclaiming: \"I  am a dead man.\"    The Prophet thought that by leaping from the window of the upper story  would attract the attention of the rabble and thus save the lives of  his friends. Willard Richards is to be seen looking from the window of  the prison upon the heart-rending scene without being able to render  the Prophet of God any assistance in his dying moments.    It is possible that while the martyr was holding on to the window sill  he received some of his wounds, before falling to the ground. As he  reached the ground he cried out: \"O Lord, my God!\"    Each received four balls. John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the  Twelve Apostles, were the only ones in the room at the time besides  the two martyrs. John Taylor was wounded severely with four balls, but  after much suffering he recovered, and lived a life of usefulness, and  finally presided over the Church, until his death. Willard Richards  escaped without a hole in his robe, and died in peace in his Utah home  many years after.    Thus two of the most noble sons of God have sealed their testimony with  their blood, and henceforth are numbered with those whom John saw under  the altar,--\"the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and  for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice,  saying: How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge  our blood on them that live on the earth? And white robes were given  every one of them: and it was said unto them, that they should rest for  a little season, until their fellow servants and their brethren, that  should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.\"    As Jesus our Saviour was crucified and his disciples martyred, and not  one of their murderers ever brought to justice (only as God punished  them), so has it been in this enlightened age of the world with  assassins who have been equally guilty.    The picture, although a sad one, is a true representation of the  tragedy, and will never be forgotten by those who once behold it. Hyrum  Smith was 44 years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was Only 38  in December, 1843. They were martyred on the 27th of June, 1844. The  late President John Taylor's watch was struck with a bullet while in  his pocket, and stopped between 4 and 5 o'clock.    I first saw Joseph Smith in 1844 at my mother's house. It was late  in the spring season. I also heard him bear his testimony many times  with a power that was not gainsaid by those who heard him testify with  regard to the visions which he had been favored with. Some of his  hearers said:    \"Well, if it is true it will stand.\"    When I heard the three witnesses testify to the coming forth of the  Book of Mormon, and that they had in open daylight both seen and  heard the voice of the angel, I knew their testimony was true. My  first impression of Joseph nearly sixty years ago was that he was a  true prophet, and I formed a love for him which increased with our  acquaintance. I was with him in the state of Missouri during those  trying scenes until his imprisonment in Liberty jail, and subsequently  in Illinois, and with the bereaved family and thousands of Latter-day  Saints shed a tear over his remains as he lay silently in death's  embrace. I took a last look at him in the Nauvoo Mansion in June, 1844.    Joseph Bates Nobles stated to me that he was with the Prophet when he  was going voluntarily to give himself up to the pretended requirements  of the law, on which occasion he said:    \"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's  morning; I have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards  all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me--'He was  murdered in cold blood.'\"    Hyrum also knew of their doom, for on the morning just before leaving  for the murderous prison he turned down the leaf of the fifth chapter  of the Book of Ether, which reads as follows:    \"And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give  unto the gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to  pass that the Lord said unto me, if they have not charity, it mattereth  not unto you, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments are  clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made  strong, even to the sitting down in the place which I have prepared  in the mansions of my father. And now I----bid farewell unto the  gentiles; yea, and also until my brethren whom, I love, [and all who  knew him well knew of his mercy and benevolence], until we shall meet  before the judgment seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my  garments are not spotted with your blood.\"    They were innocent of crime, as had been proven many, many times.  It was a conspiracy of \"traitors and wicked men,\" and their blood,  as I saw it on the floor of Carthage jail in 1844, soon after their  martyrdom, and again in 1888, is still there as a witness against the  murderers.    The jail is now transformed into a comfortable private residence, and  is occupied by Mrs. Elizabeth Mathews Browning, her husband having  deeded it to her. Many years ago the county sold the premises to Mr.  B. F. Patterson, subsequently he sold it to Mr. Jas. M. Browning, who  in turn deeded it to his wife. While being shown around the premises,  in its varied parts, by Mrs. Browning, we came to where the well  curb once stood, which is now substituted by a bed of lilies of the  valley, being assured that the spot will ever be held in remembrance.  The house has an addition of an east wing, and the rude fence has been  remodeled into a nice picket fence. Just prior to leaving Carthage, the  kind lady of the house took us up stairs, where the mob entered. We  saw the bullet hole through the door. Although repaired somewhat, we  saw where the bullet went that killed Hyrum. Other bullet marks were  also visible. Although the floor was carpeted, we were assured by Mrs.  Browning that the blood stain still remains, and cannot be washed away.    At the time of the Prophet's martyrdom, many marveled why Joseph was  taken away from the Church; but since that time we have learned that  it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to them by whom they  come. God suffered his Son Jesus to be crucified. It was necessary  to accomplish certain ends. Many have marveled because of his death,  but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood,  that he might be honored and the wicked be condemned. When Mr. O.  H. Browning, pleading for the Prophet, gave a recitation of what he  himself had seen at Quincy, Illinois, on the banks of the Mississippi  River (when the Saints were expelled from Missouri), so sad were the  scenes depicted that the spectators were moved into tears. Judge  Douglass himself and most of the officers wept. In conclusion, Mr.  Browning said:    \"Great God! have I not seen it? Yes, my eyes have beheld the  blood-stained traces of innocent women and children in the drear  winter, who have traveled hundreds of miles barefoot, through frost  and snow, to seek refuge from their savage pursuers. 'Twas a scene  of horror sufficient to elicit sympathy from an adamantine heart.  And shall this unfortunate man, whom their fury has seen proper to  select for sacrifice, be driven into such a savage land and none dare  to enlist in the cause of justice? If there was no other voice under  heaven ever to be heard in this cause, gladly would I stand alone  and proudly spend my last breath in defense of an oppressed American  citizen.\"    Judge Douglass dismissed Joseph on the 10th of June, 1841. Again in  May, 1843, he was kidnapped in Dixon, Ill., but before his enemies  succeeded in dragging him over the line into Missouri, he obtained the  aid of three lawyers, who finally secured his release on habeas corpus.  While in custody, Mr. Reynolds of Missouri several times cocked his  pistol on Joseph, threatening to shoot. The latter bared his breast,  saying:    \"Shoot away! I have endured so much I am weary"]]]
