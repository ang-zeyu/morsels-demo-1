These sayings put together, show the apostle's views most clearly,  so as to admit of no mistake on the mind of any individual. He says  that all things that pertain to life and godliness were given unto them  through the knowledge of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. And if the  question is asked, how were they to obtain the knowledge of God? (for  there is a great difference between believing in God and knowing him:  knowledge implies more than faith. And notice, that all things that  pertain to life and godliness were given through the knowledge of God;)  the answer is given, through faith they were to obtain this knowledge;  and, having power by faith to obtain the knowledge of God, they could  with it obtain all other things which pertain to life and godliness.    19. By these sayings of the Apostle we learn, that it was by obtaining  a knowledge of God, that men got the knowledge of all things which  pertain to life and godliness, and this knowledge was the effect of  faith. So that all things which pertain to life and godliness are the  effects of faith.    20. From this we may extend as far as any circumstances may require  whether on earth or in heaven, and we will find it the testimony of  all inspired men, or heavenly messengers, that all things that pertain  to life and godliness are the effects of faith and nothing else; all  learning, wisdom and prudence fail, and every thing else as a means  of salvation but faith. This is the reason that the fishermen of  Galilee could teach the world--because they sought by faith and by  faith obtained. And this is the reason that Paul counted all things  but filth and dross--what he formerly called his gain he called his  loss; yea, and he counted all things but loss for the excellency of  the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord. Phil 3:7,8,9 & 10. Because,  to obtain the faith by which he could enjoy the knowledge of Christ  Jesus the Lord, he had to suffer the loss of all things: this is the  reason that the Former Day Saints knew more, and understood more of  heaven, and of heavenly things than all others beside, because this  information is the effect of faith--to be obtained by no other means.  And this is the reason, that men, as soon as they lose their faith,  run into strifes, contentions, darkness, and difficulties; for the  knowledge which tends to life disappears with faith, but returns when  faith returns; for when faith comes, it brings its train of attendants  with it--apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, gifts,  wisdom, knowledge, miracles, healings, tongues, interpretation of  tongues, &c. All these appear when faith appears on the earth, and  disappear when it disappears from the earth. For these are the effects  of faith, and always have, and always will, attend it. For where faith  is, there will the knowledge of God be also, with all things which  pertain thereto revelations, visions, and dreams, as well as every  other necessary thing, in order that the possessors of faith may be  perfected and obtain salvation; for God must change, otherwise faith  will prevail with him. And he who possesses it will, through it, obtain  all necessary knowledge and wisdom, until he shall know God, and the  Lord Jesus Christ, whom he has sent: whom to know is eternal life: Amen.

Such interests, on the contrary, are  necessarily the predominant consideration in the mind of the central  ruler; and through the relations, more or less intimate, which he  progressively establishes with the localities, they become familiar to  the general mind. The most favorable concurrence of circumstances  under which this step in improvement could be made would be one which  should raise up representative institutions without representative  government; a representative body or bodies, drawn from the  localities, making itself the auxiliary and instrument of the central  power, but seldom attempting to thwart or control it. The people being  thus taken, as it were, into council, though not sharing the supreme  power, the political education given by the central authority is  carried home, much more effectually than it could otherwise be, to the  local chiefs and to the population generally, while, at the same time,  a tradition is kept up of government by general consent, or at least,  the sanction of tradition is not given to government without it,  which, when consecrated by custom, has so often put a bad end to a  good beginning, and is one of the most frequent causes of the sad  fatality which in most countries has stopped improvement in so early a  stage, because the work of some one period has been so done as to bar  the needful work of the ages following. Meanwhile, it may be laid down  as a political truth, that by irresponsible monarchy rather than by  representative government can a multitude of insignificant political  units be welded into a people, with common feelings of cohesion, power  enough to protect itself against conquest or foreign aggression, and  affairs sufficiently various and considerable of its own to occupy  worthily and expand to fit proportions the social and political  intelligence of the population.    For these several reasons, kingly government, free from the control  (though perhaps strengthened by the support) of representative  institutions, is the most suitable form of polity for the earliest  stages of any community, not excepting a city community like those of  ancient Greece; where, accordingly, the government of kings, under  some real, but no ostensible or constitutional control by public  opinion, did historically precede by an unknown and probably great  duration all free institutions, and gave place at last, during a  considerable lapse of time, to oligarchies of a few families.    A hundred other infirmities or shortcomings in a people might be  pointed out which _pro tanto_ disqualify them from making the best use  of representative government; but in regard to these it is not equally  obvious that the government of One or a Few would have any tendency to  cure or alleviate the evil. Strong prejudices of any kind; obstinate  adherence to old habits; positive defects of national character, or  mere ignorance, and deficiency of mental cultivation, if prevalent in  a people, will be in general faithfully reflected in their  representative assemblies; and should it happen that the executive  administration, the direct management of public affairs, is in the  hands of persons comparatively free from these defects, more good  would frequently be done by them when not hampered by the necessity of  carrying with them the voluntary assent of such bodies. But the mere  position of the rulers does not in these, as it does in the other  cases which we have examined, of itself invest them with interests and  tendencies operating in the beneficial direction. From the general  weaknesses of the people or of the state of civilization, the One and  his councillors, or the Few, are not likely to be habitually exempt;  except in the case of their being foreigners, belonging to a superior  people or a more advanced state of society. Then, indeed, the rulers  may be, to almost any extent, superior in civilization to those over  whom they rule; and subjection to a foreign government of this  description, notwithstanding its inevitable evils, is often of the  greatest advantage to a people, carrying them rapidly through several  stages of progress, and clearing away obstacles to improvement which  might have lasted indefinitely if the subject population had been left  unassisted to its native tendencies and chances. In a country not  under the dominion of foreigners, the only cause adequate to producing  similar benefits is the rare accident of a monarch of extraordinary  genius. There have been in history a few of these who, happily for  humanity, have reigned long enough to render some of their  improvements permanent, by leaving them under the guardianship of a  generation which had grown up under their influence. Charlemagne may  be cited as one instance; Peter the Great is another. Such examples  however are so unfrequent that they can only be classed with the happy  accidents which have so often decided at a critical moment whether  some leading portion of humanity should make a sudden start, or sink  back towards barbarism--chances like the existence of Themistocles at  the time of the Persian invasion, or of the first or third William of  Orange. It would be absurd to construct institutions for the mere  purpose of taking advantage of such possibilities, especially as men  of this calibre, in any distinguished position, do not require  despotic power to enable them to exert great influence, as is  evidenced by the three last mentioned. The case most requiring  consideration in reference to institutions is the not very uncommon  one in which a small but leading portion of the population, from  difference of race, more civilized origin, or other peculiarities of  circumstance, are markedly superior in civilization and general  character to the remainder. Under those conditions, government by the  representatives of the mass would stand a chance of depriving them of  much of the benefit they might derive from the greater civilization of  the superior ranks, while government by the representatives of those  ranks would probably rivet the degradation of the multitude, and leave  them no hope of decent treatment except by ridding themselves of one  of the most valuable elements of future advancement. The best prospect  of improvement for a people thus composed lies in the existence of a  constitutionally unlimited, or at least a practically preponderant  authority in the chief ruler of the dominant class. He alone has by  his position an interest in raising and improving the mass, of whom he  is not jealous, as a counterpoise to his associates, of whom he is;  and if fortunate circumstances place beside him, not as controllers  but as subordinates, a body representative of the superior caste,  which, by its objections and questionings, and by its occasional  outbreaks of spirit, keeps alive habits of collective resistance, and  may admit of being, in time and by degrees, expanded into a really  national representation (which is in substance the history of the  English Parliament), the nation has then the most favorable prospects  of improvement which can well occur to a community thus circumstanced  and constituted.    Among the tendencies which, without absolutely rendering a people  unfit for representative government, seriously incapacitate them from  reaping the full benefit of it, one deserves particular notice. There  are two states of the inclinations, intrinsically very different, but  which have something in common, by virtue of which they often coincide  in the direction they give to the efforts of individuals and of  nations; one is, the desire to exercise power over others; the other  is disinclination to have power exercised over themselves. The  difference between different portions of mankind in the relative  strength of these two dispositions is one of the most important  elements in their history. There are nations in whom the passion for  governing others is so much stronger than the desire of personal  independence, that for the mere shadow of the one they are found ready  to sacrifice the whole of the other. Each one of their number is  willing, like the private soldier in an army, to abdicate his personal  freedom of action into the hands of his general, provided the army is  triumphant and victorious, and he is able to flatter himself that he  is one of a conquering host, though the notion that he has himself any  share in the domination exercised over the conquered is an illusion. A  government strictly limited in its powers and attributions, required  to hold its hands from overmeddling, and to let most things go on  without its assuming the part of guardian or director, is not to the  taste of such a people; in their eyes the possessors of authority can  hardly take too much upon themselves, provided the authority itself is  open to general competition. An average individual among them prefers  the chance, however distant or improbable, of wielding some share of  power over his fellow-citizens, above the certainty, to himself and  others, of having no unnecessary power exercised over them. These are  the elements of a people of place-hunters, in whom the course of  politics is mainly determined by place-hunting; where equality alone  is cared for, but not liberty; where the contests of political parties  are but struggles to decide whether the power of meddling in every  thing shall belong to one class or another, perhaps merely to one knot  of public men or another; where the idea entertained of democracy is  merely that of opening offices to the competition of all instead of a  few; where, the more popular the institutions, the more innumerable  are the places created, and the more monstrous the overgovernment  exercised by all over each, and by the executive over all.
