[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#14)"],[1," the canon Robersart who had taken the vows  and afterwards broke out of cloister, and became a captain of Free  Companions. He had a mistress, the prettiest wench I ever saw, and three  as beautiful children.--There is no trusting monks, fair nephew--no  trusting them--they may become soldiers and fathers when you least  expect it--but on with your tale.\"    \"I have little more to tell,\" said Durward, \"except that, considering my  poor mother to be in some degree a pledge for me, I was induced to take  upon me the dress of a novice, and conformed to the cloister rules, and  even learned to read and write.\"    \"To read and write!\" exclaimed Le Balafre, who was one of that sort of  people who think all knowledge is miraculous which chances to exceed  their own. \"To write, say'st thou, and to read! I cannot believe  it--never Durward could write his name that ever I heard of, nor Lesly  either. I can answer for one of them--I can no more write than I can  fly. Now, in Saint Louis's name, how did they teach it you?\"    \"It was troublesome at first,\" said Durward, \"but became more easy by  use; and I was weak with my wounds, and loss of blood, and desirous to  gratify my preserver, Father Peter, and so I was the more easily kept  to my task. But after several months' languishing, my good, kind mother  died, and as my health was now fully restored, I communicated to my  benefactor, who was also Sub Prior of the convent, my reluctance to take  the vows; and it was agreed between us, since my vocation lay not to the  cloister, that I should be sent out into the world to seek my fortune,  and that to save the Sub Prior from the anger of the Ogilvies, my  departure should have the appearance of flight; and to colour it I  brought off the Abbot's hawk with me. But I was regularly dismissed, as  will appear from the hand and seal of the Abbot himself.\"    \"That is right, that is well,\" said his uncle. \"Our King cares little  what other theft thou mayst have made, but hath a horror at anything  like a breach of the cloister. And I warrant thee, thou hadst no great  treasure to bear thy charges?\"    \"Only a few pieces of silver,\" said the youth; \"for to you, fair uncle,  I must make a free confession.\"    \"Alas!\" replied Le Balafre, \"that is hard. Now, though I am never a  hoarder of my pay, because it doth ill to bear a charge about one in  these perilous times, yet I always have (and I would advise you to  follow my example) some odd gold chain, or bracelet, or carcanet,  that serves for the ornament of my person, and can at need spare a  superfluous link or two, or it may be a superfluous stone for sale, that  can answer any immediate purpose. But you may ask, fair kinsman, how you  are to come by such toys as this.\" (He shook his chain with complacent  triumph.) \"They hang not on every bush--they grow not in the fields like  the daffodils, with whose stalks children make knights' collars. What  then?--you may get such where I got this, in the service of the good  King of France, where there is always wealth to be found, if a man has  but the heart to seek it at the risk of a little life or so.\"    \"I understood,\" said Quentin, evading a decision to which he felt  himself as yet scarcely competent, \"that the Duke of Burgundy keeps a  more noble state than the King of France, and that there is more honour  to be won under his banners--that good blows are struck there, and  deeds of arms done; while the most Christian King, they say, gains his  victories by his ambassadors' tongues.\"    \"You speak like a foolish boy, fair nephew,\" answered he with the scar;  \"and yet, I bethink me, when I came hither I was nearly as simple: I  could never think of a King but what I supposed him either sitting under  the high deas, and feasting amid his high vassals and Paladins, eating  blanc mange, with a great gold crown upon his head, or else charging at  the head of his troops like Charlemagne in the romaunts, or like Robert  Bruce or William Wallace in our own true histories, such as Barbour and  the Minstrel. Hark in thine ear, man--it is all moonshine in the water.  Policy--policy does it all. But what is policy, you will say? It is an  art this French King of ours has found out, to fight with other men's  swords, and to wage his soldiers out of other men's purses. Ah! it is  the wisest prince that ever put purple on his back--and yet he weareth  not much of that neither--I see him often go plainer than I would think  befitted me to do.\"    [Charlemagne (742?-814): King of the Franks and crowned Emperor of the  Holy Roman Empire in 800. His kingdom included Germany and France, the  greater part of Italy, and Spain as far as the Ebro. As Emperor of the  West he bore the title Caesar Augustus. He established churches and  monasteries, and encouraged arts and learning. He figures largely  in mediaeval minstrelsy, where the achievements of his knights, or  paladins, rival those of Arthur's court.]    [Robert Bruce: the grandson of Robert Bruce, the competitor with John  Baliol for the Scottish throne. He defeated the English forces at  Bannockburn in 1314, and thus secured the independence of Scotland, an  independence which lasted until the two kingdoms were united under one  crown in 1707.]    [William Wallace: another brave Scottish leader in the war for  independence against Edward I of England. Wallace was betrayed in 1305  and carried to London, where he was cruelly executed as a traitor.]    [Barbour: an eminent Scottish poet contemporary with Chaucer. His  principal work, The Bruce, records the life and deeds of Robert Bruce.]    [Harry the Minstrel or \"Blind Harry\" was the author of a poem on the  life and deeds of Wallace which was held in peculiar reverence by the  Scotch people.]    \"But you meet not my exception, fair uncle,\" answered young Durward;  \"I would serve, since serve I must in a foreign land, somewhere where a  brave deed, were it my hap to do one, might work me a name.\"    \"I understand you, my fair nephew,\" said the royal man at arms, \"I  understand you passing well; but you are unripe in these matters. The  Duke of Burgundy is a hot brained, impetuous, pudding headed, iron  ribbed dare all. He charges at the head of his nobles and native  knights, his liegemen of Artois and Hainault; think you, if you were  there, or if I were there myself, that we could be much farther forward  than the Duke and all his brave nobles of his own land? If we were not  up with them, we had a chance to be turned on the Provost Marshal's  hands for being slow in making to; if we were abreast of them, all would  be called well and we might be thought to have deserved our pay; and  grant that I was a spear's length or so in the front, which is both  difficult and dangerous in such a melee where all do their best, why, my  lord Duke says in his Flemish tongue, when he sees a good blow struck,  'Ha! gut getroffen [well struck]! a good lance--a brave Scot--give him a  florin to drink our health;' but neither rank, nor lands, nor treasures  come to the stranger in such a service--all goes to the children of the  soil.\"    \"And where should it go, in Heaven's name, fair uncle?\" demanded young  Durward.    \"To him that protects the children of the soil,\" said Balafre,  drawing up his gigantic height. \"Thus says King Louis 'My good French  peasant--mine honest Jacques Bonhomme, get you to your tools, your  plough and your harrow, your pruning knife and your hoe--here is my  gallant Scot that will fight for you, and you shall only have the  trouble to pay him. And you, my most serene duke, my illustrious count,  and my most mighty marquis, e'en rein up your fiery courage till it  is wanted, for it is apt to start out of the course, and to hurt  its master; here are my companies of ordnance--here are my French  Guards--here are, above all, my Scottish Archers, and mine honest  Ludovic with the Scar, who will fight, as well or better than you, will  fight with all that undisciplined valour which, in your father's time,  lost Cressy and Azincour [two famous victories in the Hundred Years'  War gained over the French by the English, near the towns of Crecy and  Agincourt, in 1346 and 1415. See Shakespeare's Henry V for a description  of the latter.]. Now, see you not in which of these states a cavalier of  fortune holds the highest rank, and must come to the highest honour?\"    \"I think I understand you, fair uncle,\" answered the nephew; \"but, in my  mind, honour cannot be won where there is no risk. Sure, this is--I pray  pardon me--an easy and almost slothful life, to mount guard round an  elderly man whom no one thinks of harming, to spend summer day and  winter night up in yonder battlements, and shut up all the while in iron  cages, for fear you should desert your posts--uncle, uncle, it is but a  hawk upon his perch, who is never carried out to the fields!\"    \"Now, by Saint Martin of Tours, the boy has some spirit! a right touch  of the Lesly in him; much like myself, though always with a little more  folly in it. Hark ye, youth--Long live the King of France!--scarce a day  but there is some commission in hand, by which some of his followers may  win both coin and credit. Think not that the bravest and most dangerous  deeds are done by daylight. I could tell you of some, as scaling  castles, making prisoners, and the like, where one who shall be nameless  hath run higher risk and gained greater favour than any desperado in the  train of desperate Charles of Burgundy. And if it please his Majesty to  remain behind, and in the background, while such things are doing, he  hath the more leisure of spirit to admire, and the more liberality of  hand to reward the adventurers, whose dangers, perhaps, and whose feats  of arms, he can better judge of than if he had personally shared them.  Oh, 't is a sagacious and most politic monarch!\"    His nephew paused, and then said, in a low but impressive tone of voice,  \"the good Father Peter used"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#14)"],[1,"Utanka saluted the monarch by pronouncing blessings and  said, 'I am come as a petitioner to thee.' And King Paushya, having  returned Utanka's salutations, said, 'Sir, what shall I do for thee?' And  Utanka said, 'I came to beg of thee a pair of ear-rings as a present to my  preceptor. It behoveth thee to give me the ear-rings worn by the Queen.'    \"King Paushya replied, 'Go, Utanka, into the female apartments where the  Queen is and demand them of her.' And Utanka went into the women's  apartments. But as he could not discover the Queen, he again addressed the  king, saying, 'It is not proper that I should be treated by thee with  deceit. Thy Queen is not in the private apartments, for I could not find  her.' The king thus addressed, considered for a while and replied,  'Recollect, Sir, with attention whether thou art not in a state of  defilement in consequence of contact with the impurities of a repast. My  Queen is a chaste wife and cannot be seen by any one who is impure owing  to contact with the leavings of a repast. Nor doth she herself appear in  sight of any one who is defiled.'    \"Utanka, thus informed, reflected for a while and then said, 'Yes, it must  be so. Having been in a hurry I performed my ablutions (after meal) in a  standing posture.' King Paushya then said, 'Here is a transgression,  purification is not properly effected by one in a standing posture, nor by  one while he is going along.' And Utanka having agreed to this, sat down  with his face towards the east, and washed his face, hands, and feet  thoroughly. And he then, without a noise, sipped thrice of water free from  scum and froth, and not warm, and just sufficient to reach his stomach and  wiped his face twice. And he then touched with water the apertures of his  organs (eyes, ears, etc.). And having done all this, he once more entered  the apartments of the women. And this time he saw the Queen. And as the  Queen perceived him, she saluted him respectfully and said, 'Welcome, Sir,  command me what I have to do.' And Utanka said unto her, 'It behoveth thee  to give me those ear-rings of thine. I beg them as a present for my  preceptor.' And the Queen having been highly pleased with Utanka's conduct  and, considering that Utanka as an object of charity could not be passed  over, took off her ear-rings and gave them to him. And she said, 'These  ear-rings are very much sought after by Takshaka, the King of the serpents.  Therefore shouldst thou carry them with the greatest care.'    \"And Utanka being told this, said unto the Queen, 'Lady, be under no  apprehension. Takshaka, Chief of the serpents, is not able to overtake me.'  And having said this, and taking leave of the Queen, he went back into  the presence of Paushya, and said, 'Paushya, I am gratified.' Then Paushya  said to Utanka, 'A fit object of charity can only be had at long intervals.  Thou art a qualified guest, therefore do I desire to perform a sraddha.  Tarry thou a little.' And Utanka replied, 'Yes, I will tarry, and beg that  the clean provisions that are ready may be soon brought in.' And the king  having signified his assent, entertained Utanka duly. And Utanka seeing  that the food placed before him had hair in it, and also that it was cold,  thought it unclean. And he said unto Paushya, 'Thou givest me food that is  unclean, therefore shalt thou lose thy sight.' And Paushya in answer said,  'And because dost thou impute uncleanliness to food that is clean,  therefore shalt thou be without issue.' And Utanka thereupon rejoined, 'It  behoveth thee not, after having offered me unclean food, to curse me in  return. Satisfy thyself by ocular proof.'    \"And Paushya seeing the food alleged to be unclean satisfied himself of  its uncleanliness. And Paushya having ascertained that the food was truly  unclean, being cold and mixed with hair, prepared as it was by a woman  with unbraided hair, began to pacify the Rishi Utanka, saying, 'Sir, the  food placed before thee is cold, and doth contain hair, having been  prepared without sufficient care. Therefore I pray thee pardon me. Let me  not become blind.' And Utanka answered, 'What I say must come to pass.  Having become blind, thou mayst, however, recover the sight before long.  Grant that thy curse also doth not take effect on me.' And Paushya said  unto him, 'I am unable to revoke my curse. For my wrath even now hath not  been appeased. But thou knowest not this. For a Brahmana's heart is soft  as new-churned butter, even though his words bear a sharp-edged razor. It  is otherwise in respect of these with the Kshatriya. His words are soft as  new-churned butter, but his heart is like a sharp-edged tool, such being  the case, I am unable, because of the hardness of my heart, to neutralise  my curse. Then go thou thy own way.' To this Utanka made answer, 'I showed  thee the uncleanliness of the food offered to me, and I was even now  pacified by thee. Besides, saidst thou at first that because I imputed  uncleanliness to food that was clean I should be without issue. But the  food truly unclean, thy curse cannot affect me. Of this I am sure.' And  Utanka having said this departed with the ear-rings.    \"On the road Utanka perceived coming towards him a naked idle beggar  sometimes coming in view and sometimes disappearing. And Utanka put the  ear-rings on the ground and went for water. In the meantime the beggar  came quickly to the spot and taking up the ear-rings ran away. And Utanka  having completed his ablutions in water and purified himself and having  also reverently bowed down to the gods and his spiritual masters pursued  the thief with the utmost speed. And having with great difficulty  overtaken him, he seized him by force. But at that instant the person  seized, quitting the form of a beggar and assuming his real form, viz.,  that of Takshaka, speedily entered a large hole open in the ground. And  having got in, Takshaka proceeded to his own abode, the region of the  serpents.    \"Now, Utanka, recollecting the words of the Queen, pursued the Serpent,  and began to dig open the hole with a stick but was unable to make much  progress. And Indra beholding his distress sent his thunder-bolt (Vajra)  to his assistance. Then the thunder-bolt entering that stick enlarged that  hole. And Utanka began to enter the hole after the thunder-bolt. And  having entered it, he beheld the region of the serpents infinite in extent,  filled with hundreds of palaces and elegant mansions with turrets and  domes and gate-ways, abounding with wonderful places for various games and  entertainments. And Utanka then glorified the serpents by the following  slokas:    \"'Ye Serpents, subjects of King Airavata, splendid in battle and showering  weapons in the field like lightning-charged clouds driven by the winds!  Handsome and of various forms and decked with many coloured ear-rings, ye  children of Airavata, ye shine like the Sun in the firmament! On the  northern banks of the Ganges are many habitations of serpents. There I  constantly adore the great serpents. Who except Airavata would desire to  move in the burning rays of the Sun? When Dhritarashtra (Airavata's  brother) goes out, twenty-eight thousand and eight serpents follow him as  his attendants. Ye who move near him and ye who stay at a distance from  him, I adore all of you that have Airavata for your elder brother.    \"'I adore thee also, to obtain the ear-rings, O Takshaka, who formerly  dwelt in Kurukshetra and the forest of Khandava! Takshaka and Aswasena, ye  are constant companions who dwell in Kurukshetra on the banks of the  Ikshumati! I also adore the illustrious Srutasena, the younger brother of  Takshaka, who resided at the holy place called Mahadyumna with a view to  obtaining the chiefship of the serpents.'    \"The Brahmana Rishi Utanka having saluted the chief serpents in this  manner, obtained not, however, the ear-rings. And he thereupon became very  thoughtful. And when he saw that he obtained not the ear-rings even though  he had adored the serpents, he then looked about him and beheld two women  at a loom weaving a piece of cloth with a fine shuttle; and in the loom  were black and white threads. And he likewise saw a wheel, with twelve  spokes, turned by six boys. And he also saw a man with a handsome horse.  And he began to address them the following mantras:    \"'This wheel whose circumference is marked by twenty-four divisions  representing as many lunar changes is furnished with three hundred spokes!  It is set in continual motion by six boys (the seasons)! These damsels  representing universal nature are weaving without intermission a cloth  with threads black and white, and thereby ushering into existence the  manifold worlds and the beings that inhabit them! Thou wielder of the  thunder, the protector of the universe, the slayer of Vritra and Namuchi,  thou illustrious one who wearest the black cloth and displayest truth and  untruth in the universe, thou who ownest for thy carrier the horse which  was received from the depths of the ocean, and which is but another form  of Agni (the god of fire), I bow to thee, thou supreme Lord, thou Lord of  the three worlds, O Purandara!'    \"Then the man with the horse said unto Utanka, 'I am gratified by this thy  adoration. What good shall I do to thee?' And Utanka replied, 'Even let  the serpents be brought under my control.' Then the man rejoined, 'Blow  into this horse.' And Utanka blew into that horse. And from the horse thus  blown into, there issued, from every aperture of his body, flames of fire  with smoke by which the region of the Nagas was about to be consumed. And  Takshaka, surprised beyond measure and terrified by the heat of the fire,  hastily came out of his abode taking the ear-rings with him, and said unto  Utanka, 'Pray, Sir, take back the ear-rings.' And Utanka took them back.    \"But Utanka having recovered his ear-rings thought, 'O, this is that  sacred day of my preceptress. "]]]
