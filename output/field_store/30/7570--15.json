Any attempt to free painting from this material limitation  together with the striving after a new form of composition must  concern itself first of all with the destruction of this theory  of one single surface--attempts must be made to bring the picture  on to some ideal plane which shall be expressed in terms of the  material plane of the canvas. [Footnote: Compare the article by  Le Fauconnier in the catalogue of the second exhibition of the  Neue Kunstlervereinigung, Munich, 1910-11.] There has arisen out  of the composition in flat triangles a composition with plastic  three-dimensional triangles, that is to say with pyramids; and  that is Cubism. But there has arisen here also the tendency to  inertia, to a concentration on this form for its own sake, and  consequently once more to an impoverishment of possibility. But  that is the unavoidable result of the external application of an  inner principle.    A further point of great importance must not be forgotten. There  are other means of using the material plane as a space of three  dimensions in order to create an ideal plane. The thinness or  thickness of a line, the placing of the form on the surface, the  overlaying of one form on another may be quoted as examples of  artistic means that may be employed. Similar possibilities are  offered by colour which, when rightly used, can advance or  retreat, and can make of the picture a living thing, and so  achieve an artistic expansion of space. The combination of both  means of extension in harmony or concord is one of the richest  and most powerful elements in purely artistic composition.        VII. THEORY        From the nature of modern harmony, it results that never has  there been a time when it was more difficult than it is today to  formulate a complete theory, [Footnote: Attempts have been made.  Once more emphasis must be laid on the parallel with music. For  example, cf. \"Tendances Nouvelles,\" No. 35, Henri Ravel: \"The  laws of harmony are the same for painting and music.\"] or to lay  down a firm artistic basis. All attempts to do so would have one  result, namely, that already cited in the case of Leonardo and  his system of little spoons. It would, however, be precipitate to  say that there are no basic principles nor firm rules in  painting, or that a search for them leads inevitably to  academism. Even music has a grammar, which, although modified  from time to time, is of continual help and value as a kind of  dictionary.    Painting is, however, in a different position. The revolt from  dependence on nature is only just beginning. Any realization of  the inner working of colour and form is so far unconscious. The  subjection of composition to some geometrical form is no new idea  (cf. the art of the Persians). Construction on a purely abstract  basis is a slow business, and at first seemingly blind and  aimless. The artist must train not only his eye but also his  soul, so that he can test colours for themselves and not only by  external impressions.    If we begin at once to break the bonds which bind us to nature,  and devote ourselves purely to combination of pure colour and  abstract form, we shall produce works which are mere decoration,  which are suited to neckties or carpets. Beauty of Form and  Colour is no sufficient aim by itself, despite the assertions of  pure aesthetes or even of naturalists, who are obsessed with the  idea of \"beauty.\" It is because of the elementary stage reached  by our painting that we are so little able to grasp the inner  harmony of true colour and form composition. The nerve vibrations  are there, certainly, but they get no further than the nerves,  because the corresponding vibrations of the spirit which they  call forth are too weak. When we remember, however, that  spiritual experience is quickening, that positive science, the  firmest basis of human thought, is tottering, that dissolution of  matter is imminent, we have reason to hope that the hour of pure  composition is not far away.    It must not be thought that pure decoration is lifeless. It has  its inner being, but one which is either incomprehensible to us,  as in the case of old decorative art, or which seems mere  illogical confusion, as a world in which full-grown men and  embryos play equal roles, in which beings deprived of limbs are  on a level with noses and toes which live isolated and of their  own vitality. The confusion is like that of a kaleidoscope, which  though possessing a life of its own, belongs to another sphere.  Nevertheless, decoration has its effect on us; oriental  decoration quite differently to Swedish, savage, or ancient  Greek. It is not for nothing that there is a general custom of  describing samples of decoration as gay, serious, sad, etc., as  music is described as Allegro, Serioso, etc., according to the  nature of the piece.    Probably conventional decoration had its beginnings in nature.  But when we would assert that external nature is the sole source  of all art, we must remember that, in patterning, natural objects  are used as symbols, almost as though they were mere  hieroglyphics. For this reason we cannot gauge their inner  harmony. For instance, we can bear a design of Chinese dragons in  our dining or bed rooms, and are no more disturbed by it than by  a design of daisies.    It is possible that towards the close of our already dying epoch  a new decorative art will develop, but it is not likely to be  founded on geometrical form. At the present time any attempt to  define this new art would be as useless as pulling a small bud  open so as to make a fully blown flower. Nowadays we are still  bound to external nature and must find our means of expression in  her. But how are we to do it? In other words, how far may we go  in altering the forms and colours of this nature?    We may go as far as the artist is able to carry his emotion, and  once more we see how immense is the need for true emotion. A few  examples will make the meaning of this clearer.    A warm red tone will materially alter in inner value when it is  no longer considered as an isolated colour, as something  abstract, but is applied as an element of some other object, and  combined with natural form. The variety of natural forms will  create a variety of spiritual values, all of which will harmonize  with that of the original isolated red. Suppose we combine red  with sky, flowers, a garment, a face, a horse, a tree.    A red sky suggests to us sunset, or fire, and has a consequent  effect upon us--either of splendour or menace. Much depends now  on the way in which other objects are treated in connection with  this red sky. If the treatment is faithful to nature, but all the  same harmonious, the \"naturalistic\" appeal of the sky is  strengthened. If, however, the other objects are treated in a way  which is more abstract, they tend to lessen, if not to destroy,  the naturalistic appeal of the sky. Much the same applies to the  use of red in a human face. In this case red can be employed to  emphasize the passionate or other characteristics of the model,  with a force that only an extremely abstract treatment of the  rest of the picture can subdue.    A red garment is quite a different matter; for it can in reality  be of any colour. Red will, however, be found best to supply the  needs of pure artistry, for here alone can it be used without any  association with material aims. The artist has to consider not  only the value of the red cloak by itself, but also its value in  connection with the figure wearing it, and further the relation  of the figure to the whole picture. Suppose the picture to be a  sad one, and the red-cloaked figure to be the central point on  which the sadness is concentrated--either from its central  position, or features, attitude, colour, or what not. The red  will provide an acute discord of feeling, which will emphasize  the gloom of the picture. The use of a colour, in itself sad,  would weaken the effect of the dramatic whole. [Footnote: Once  more it is wise to emphasize the necessary inadequacy of these  examples. Rules cannot be laid down, the variations are so  endless. A single line can alter the whole composition of a  picture.] This is the principle of antithesis already defined.  Red by itself cannot have a sad effect on the spectator, and its  inclusion in a sad picture will, if properly handled, provide the  dramatic element. [Footnote: The use of terms like \"sad\" and  \"joyful\" are only clumsy equivalents for the delicate spiritual  vibrations of the new harmony. They must be read as necessarily  inadequate.]    Yet again is the case of a red tree different. The fundamental  value of red remains, as in every case. But the association of  \"autumn\" creeps in.    The colour combines easily with this association, and there is no  dramatic clash as in the case of the red cloak.    Finally, the red horse provides a further variation. The very  words put us in another atmosphere. The impossibility of a red  horse demands an unreal world. It is possible that this  combination of colour and form will appeal as a freak--a purely  superficial and non-artistic appeal--or as a hint of a fairy  story [Footnote: An incomplete fairy story works on the mind as  does a cinematograph film.]--once more a non-artistic appeal. To  set this red horse in a careful naturalistic landscape would  create such a discord as to produce no appeal and no coherence.  The need for coherence is the essential of harmony--whether  founded on conventional discord or concord. The new harmony  demands that the inner value of a picture should remain unified  whatever the variations or contrasts of outward form or colour.  The elements of the new art are to be found, therefore, in the  inner and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#14)"],[1,"  Lovin, her's sacrament.  She's so clean, an'  pure, an' honest, an' big-hearted!  In forty year I've never jest durst  brace right up to Maria an' try to put in words what she means to me.  Never saw nothin' else as beautiful, or as good.  No flower's as  fragrant an' smelly as her hair on her pillow.  Never tapped a bee tree  with honey sweet as her lips a-twitchin' with a love quiver.  Ain't a  bird 'long the ol' Wabash with a voice up to hers.  Love o' God ain't  broader'n her kindness.  When she's been home to see her folks, I've  been so hungry for her 'at I've gone to her closet an' kissed the hem  o' her skirts more'n once.  I've never yet dared kiss her feet, but  I've always wanted to.  I've laid out 'at if she dies first, I'll do it  then.  An' Maria 'ud cry her eyes out if you'd a-hit the redbird.  Your  trappin's look like you could shoot.  I guess 'twas God made that shot  fly the mark.  I guess--\"    \"If you can stop, for the love of mercy do it!\" cried the hunter.    His face was a sickly white, his temples wet with sweat, and his body  trembling.  \"I can't endure any more.  I don't suppose you think I've  any human instincts at all; but I have a few, and I see the way to  arouse more.  You probably won't believe me, but I'll never kill  another innocent harmless thing; and I will never lie again so long as  I live.\"    He leaned his gun against the thorn tree, and dropped the remainder of  his hunter's outfit beside it on the ground.    \"I don't seem a fit subject to `have dominion,'\" he said.  \"I'll leave  those thing for you; and thank you for what you have done for me.\"    There was a crash through the bushes, a leap over the fence, and Abram  and the Cardinal were alone.    The old man sat down suddenly on a fallen limb of the sycamore.  He was  almost dazed with astonishment.  He held up his shaking hands, and  watched them wonderingly, and then cupped one over each trembling knee  to steady himself.  He outlined his dry lips with the tip of his  tongue, and breathed in heavy gusts.  He glanced toward the thorn tree.    \"Left his gun,\" he hoarsely whispered, \"an' it's fine as a fiddle.  Lock, stock, an' barrel just a-shinin'.  An' all that heap o' leather  fixin's.  Must a-cost a lot o' money.  Said he wasn't fit to use 'em!  Lept the fence like a panther, an' cut dirt across the corn field.  An'  left me the gun!  Well! Well!  Well! Wonder what I said? I must a-been  almost FIERCE.\"    \"See here! See here!\" shrilled the Cardinal.    Abram looked him over carefully.  He was quivering with fear, but in no  way injured.    \"My! but that was a close call, ol' fellow\" said, Abram.  \"Minute  later, an' our fun 'ud a-been over, an' the summer jest spoiled.  Wonder if you knew what it meant, an' if you'll be gun-shy after this.  Land knows, I hope so; for a few more such doses 'ull jest lay me up.\"    He gathered himself together at last, set the gun over the fence, and  climbing after it, caught Nancy, who had feasted to plethora on young  corn.  He fastened up the trace-chains, and climbing to her back, laid  the gun across his lap and rode to the barn.  He attended the mare with  particular solicitude, and bathed his face and hands in the water  trough to make himself a little more presentable to Maria.  He started  to the house, but had only gone a short way when he stopped, and after  standing in thought for a time, turned back to the barn and gave Nancy  another ear of corn.    \"After all, it was all you, ol' girl,\" he said, patting her shoulder,  \"I never on earth could a-made it on time afoot.\"    He was so tired he leaned for support against her, for the unusual  exertion and intense excitement were telling on him sorely, and as he  rested he confided to her: \"I don't know as I ever in my life was so  riled, Nancy.  I'm afraid I was a little mite fierce.\"    He exhibited the gun, and told the story very soberly at supper time;  and Maria was so filled with solicitude for him and the bird, and so  indignant at the act of the hunter, that she never said a word about  Abram's torn clothing and the hours of patching that would ensue.  She  sat looking at the gun and thinking intently for a long time; and then  she said pityingly:    \"I don't know jest what you could a-said 'at 'ud make a man go off an'  leave a gun like that.  Poor fellow!  I do hope, Abram, you didn't come  down on him too awful strong.  Maybe he lost his mother when he was  jest a little tyke, an' he hasn't had much teachin'.\"    Abram was completely worn out, and went early to bed.  Far in the night  Maria felt him fumbling around her face in an effort to learn if she  were covered; and as he drew the sheet over her shoulder he muttered in  worn and sleepy tones: \"I'm afraid they's no use denyin' it, Maria, I  WAS JEST MORTAL FIERCE.\"    In the sumac the frightened little mother cardinal was pressing her  precious babies close against her breast; and all through the night she  kept calling to her mate, \"Chook! Chook!\" and was satisfied only when  an answering \"Chip!\" came.  As for the Cardinal, he had learned a new  lesson.  He had not been under fire before.  Never again would he trust  any one carrying a shining thing that belched fire and smoke.  He had  seen the hunter coming, and had raced home to defend his mate and  babies, thus making a brilliant mark of himself; and as he would not  have deserted them, only the arrival of the farmer had averted a  tragedy in the sumac.  He did not learn to use caution for himself; but  after that, if a gun came down the shining river, he sent a warning  \"Chip!\" to his mate, telling her to crouch low in her nest and keep  very quiet, and then, in broken waves of flight, and with chirp and  flutter, he exposed himself until he had lured danger from his beloved  ones.    When the babies grew large enough for their mother to leave them a  short time, she assisted in food hunting, and the Cardinal was not so  busy.  He then could find time frequently to mount to the top of the  dogwood, and cry to the world, \"See here! See here!\" for the cardinal  babies were splendid.  But his music was broken intermittent vocalizing  now, often uttered past a beakful of food, and interspersed with  spasmodic \"chips\" if danger threatened his mate and nestlings.    Despite all their care, it was not so very long until trouble came to  the sumac; and it was all because the first-born was plainly greedy;  much more so than either his little brother or his sister, and he was  one day ahead of them in strength.  He always pushed himself forward,  cried the loudest and longest, and so took the greater part of the food  carried to the nest; and one day, while he was still quite awkward and  uncertain, he climbed to the edge and reached so far that he fell.  He  rolled down the river bank, splash! into the water; and a hungry old  pickerel, sunning in the weeds, finished him at a snap.  He made a  morsel so fat, sweet, and juicy that the pickerel lingered close for a  week, waiting to see if there would be any more accidents.    The Cardinal, hunting grubs in the corn field, heard the frightened  cries of his mate, and dashed to the sumac in time to see the poor  little ball of brightly tinted feathers disappear in the water and to  hear the splash of the fish.  He called in helpless panic and fluttered  over the spot.  He watched and waited until there was no hope of the  nestling coming up, then he went to the sumac to try to comfort his  mate.  She could not be convinced that her young one was gone, and for  the remainder of the day filled the air with alarm cries and notes of  wailing.    The two that remained were surely the envy of Birdland.  The male baby  was a perfect copy of his big crimson father, only his little coat was  gray; but it was so highly tinged with red that it was brilliant, and  his beak and feet were really red; and how his crest did flare, and how  proud and important he felt, when he found he could raise and lower it  at will.  His sister was not nearly so bright as he, and she was almost  as greedy as the lost brother.  With his father's chivalry he allowed  her to crowd in and take the most of the seeds and berries, so that she  continually appeared as if she could swallow no more, yet she was  constantly calling for food.    She took the first flight, being so greedy she forgot to be afraid, and  actually flew to a neighbouring thorn tree to meet the Cardinal, coming  with food, before she realized what she had done.  For once gluttony  had its proper reward.  She not only missed the bite, but she got her  little self mightily well scared.  With popping eyes and fear-flattened  crest, she clung to the thorn limb, shivering at the depths below; and  it was the greatest comfort when her brother plucked up courage and  came sailing across to her.  But, of course, she could not be expected  to admit that.  When she saw how easily he did it, she flared her  crest, turned her head indifferently, and inquired if he did not find  flying a very easy matter, once he mustered courage to try it; and she  made him very much ashamed indeed because he had allowed her to be the  first to leave the nest.  From the thorn tree they worked their way to  the dead sycamore; but there the lack of foliage made them so  conspicuous that their mother almost went into spasms from fright, and  she literally drove them back to the sumac.    The Cardinal was so inordinately proud, and made such a brave showing  of teaching them to fly, bathe, and all the other things necessary for  young birds to know, that it was a great mercy they escaped with their  lives.  He had mastered many lessons, but he never could be taught how  to be quiet and conceal himself.  With explosive \"chips\" flaming and  flashing, he met dangers that sent all the other birds beside the  shining river racing to cover.  Concealment he scorned; and repose he  never knew.    It was a summer full of rich experience for the Cardinal."]]]
