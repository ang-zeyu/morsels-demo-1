Charles was then only a child of twelve, and so his followers did  wisely in hurrying him out of England, through the Scilly isles and  Jersey to his mother's place of exile. Of course, a child so very young  could be of no value as a leader, though his presence might prove an  inspiration.    In 1648, however, when he was eighteen years of age, he gathered a  fleet of eighteen ships and cruised along the English coast, taking  prizes, which he carried to the Dutch ports. When he was at Holland's  capital, during his father's trial, he wrote many messages to the  Parliamentarians, and even sent them a blank charter, which they might  fill in with any stipulations they desired if only they would save and  restore their king.    When the head of Charles rolled from the velvet-covered block his son  showed himself to be no loiterer or lover of an easy life. He hastened  to Scotland, skilfully escaping an English force, and was proclaimed as  king and crowned at Scone, in 1651. With ten thousand men he dashed  into England, where he knew there were many who would rally at his  call. But it was then that Cromwell put forth his supreme military  genius and with his Ironsides crushed the royal troops at Worcester.    Charles knew that for the present all was lost. He showed courage and  address in covering the flight of his beaten soldiers; but he soon  afterward went to France, remaining there and in the Netherlands for  eight years as a pensioner of Louis XIV. He knew that time would fight  for him far more surely than infantry and horse. England had not been  called \"Merry England\" for nothing; and Cromwell's tyranny was likely  to be far more resented than the heavy hand of one who was born a king.  So Charles at Paris and Liege, though he had little money at the time,  managed to maintain a royal court, such as it was.    Here there came out another side of his nature. As a child he had borne  hardship and privation and had seen the red blood flow upon the  battlefield. Now, as it were, he allowed a certain sensuous,  pleasure-loving ease to envelop him. The red blood should become the  rich red burgundy; the sound of trumpets and kettledrums should give  way to the melody of lutes and viols. He would be a king of pleasure if  he were to be king at all. And therefore his court, even in exile, was  a court of gallantry and ease. The Pope refused to lend him money, and  the King of France would not increase his pension, but there were many  who foresaw that Charles would not long remain in exile; and so they  gave him what he wanted and waited until he could give them what they  would ask for in their turn.    Charles at this time was not handsome, like his father. His complexion  was swarthy, his figure by no means imposing, though always graceful.  When he chose he could bear himself with all the dignity of a monarch.  He had a singularly pleasant manner, and a word from him could win over  the harshest opponent.    The old cavaliers who accompanied their master in exile were like  Napoleon's veterans in Elba. With their tall, powerful forms they  stalked about the courtyards, sniffing their disapproval at these  foreign ways and longing grimly for the time when they could once more  smell the pungent powder of the battle-field. But, as Charles had  hoped, the change was coming. Not merely were his own subjects  beginning to long for him and to pray in secret for the king, but  continental monarchs who maintained spies in England began to know of  this. To them Charles was no longer a penniless exile. He was a king  who before long would take possession of his kingdom.    A very wise woman--the Queen Regent of Portugal--was the first to act  on this information. Portugal was then very far from being a petty  state. It had wealth at home and rich colonies abroad, while its flag  was seen on every sea. The queen regent, being at odds with Spain, and  wishing to secure an ally against that power, made overtures to  Charles, asking him whether a match might not be made between him and  the Princess Catharine of Braganza. It was not merely her daughter's  hand that she offered, but a splendid dowry. She would pay Charles a  million pounds in gold and cede to England two valuable ports.    The match was not yet made, but by 1659 it had been arranged. The  Spaniards were furious, for Charles's cause began to appear successful.    She was a quaint and rather piteous little figure, she who was destined  to be the wife of the Merry Monarch. Catharine was dark, petite, and by  no means beautiful; yet she had a very sweet expression and a heart of  utter innocence. She had been wholly convent-bred. She knew nothing of  the world. She was told that in marriage she must obey in all things,  and that the chief duty of a wife was to make her husband happy.    Poor child! It was a too gracious preparation for a very graceless  husband. Charles, in exile, had already made more than one  discreditable connection and he was already the father of more than one  growing son.    First of all, he had been smitten by the bold ways of one Lucy Walters.  Her impudence amused the exiled monarch. She was not particularly  beautiful, and when she spoke as others did she was rather tiresome;  but her pertness and the inexperience of the king when he went into  exile made her seem attractive. She bore him a son, in the person of  that brilliant adventurer whom Charles afterward created Duke of  Monmouth. Many persons believe that Charles had married Lucy Walters,  just as George IV. may have married Mrs. Fitzherbert; yet there is not  the slightest proof of it, and it must be classed with popular legends.    There was also one Catherine Peg, or Kep, whose son was afterward made  Earl of Plymouth. It must be confessed that in his attachments to  English women Charles showed little care for rank or station. Lucy  Walters and Catherine Peg were very illiterate creatures.    In a way it was precisely this sort of preference that made Charles so  popular among the people. He seemed to make rank of no account, but  would chat in the most familiar and friendly way with any one whom he  happened to meet. His easy, democratic manner, coupled with the grace  and prestige of royalty, made friends for him all over England. The  treasury might be nearly bankrupt; the navy might be routed by the  Dutch; the king himself might be too much given to dissipation; but his  people forgave him all, because everybody knew that Charles would clap  an honest citizen on the back and joke with all who came to see him  feed the swans in Regent's Park.    The popular name for him was \"Rowley,\" or \"Old Rowley\"--a nickname of  mysterious origin, though it is said to have been given him from a  fancied resemblance to a famous hunter in his stables. Perhaps it is  the very final test of popularity that a ruler should have a nickname  known to every one.    Cromwell's death roused all England to a frenzy of king-worship. The  Roundhead, General Monk, and his soldiers proclaimed Charles King of  England and escorted him to London in splendid state. That was a day  when national feeling reached a point such as never has been before or  since. Oughtred, the famous mathematician, died of joy when the royal  emblems were restored. Urquhart, the translator of Rabelais, died, it  is said, of laughter at the people's wild delight--a truly Rabelaisian  end.    There was the king once more; and England, breaking through its long  period of Puritanism, laughed and danced with more vivacity than ever  the French had shown. All the pipers and the players and panderers to  vice, the mountebanks, the sensual men, and the lawless women poured  into the presence of the king, who had been too long deprived of the  pleasure that his nature craved. Parliament voted seventy thousand  pounds for a memorial to Charles's father, but the irresponsible king  spent the whole sum on the women who surrounded him. His severest  counselor, Lord Clarendon, sent him a remonstrance.    \"How can I build such a memorial,\" asked Charles, \"when I don't know  where my father's remains are buried!\"    He took money from the King of France to make war against the Dutch,  who had befriended him. It was the French king, too, who sent him that  insidious, subtle daughter of Brittany, Louise de Keroualle--Duchess of  Portsmouth--a diplomat in petticoats, who won the king's wayward  affections, and spied on what he did and said, and faithfully reported  all of it to Paris. She became the mother of the Duke of Lenox, and she  was feared and hated by the English more than any other of his  mistresses. They called her \"Madam Carwell,\" and they seemed to have an  instinct that she was no mere plaything of his idle hours, but was like  some strange exotic serpent, whose poison might in the end sting the  honor of England.    There is a pitiful little episode in the marriage of Charles with his  Portuguese bride, Catharine of Braganza. The royal girl came to him  fresh from the cloisters of her convent. There was something about her  grace and innocence that touched the dissolute monarch, who was by no  means without a heart. For a time he treated her with great respect,  and she was happy. At last she began to notice about her strange  faces--faces that were evil, wanton, or overbold. The court became more  and more a seat of reckless revelry.    Finally Catharine was told that the Duchess of Cleveland--that splendid  termagant, Barbara Villiers--had been appointed lady of the bedchamber.  She was told at the same time who this vixen was--that she was no fit  attendant for a virtuous woman, and that her three sons, the Dukes of  Southampton, Grafton, and Northumberland, were also the sons of Charles.    Fluttered and frightened and dismayed, the queen hastened to her  husband and begged him not to put this slight upon her. A year or two  before, she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#14)"],[1,"ed, mourned for him as a \"martyr.\"    Many hardships they underwent while Cromwell ruled with his iron hand;  and when that iron hand was relaxed in death, and poor, feeble Richard  Cromwell slunk away to his country-seat, what wonder is it that young  Charles came back to England and caracoled through the streets of London  with a smile for every one and a happy laugh upon his lips? What wonder  is it that the cannon in the Tower thundered a loud welcome, and that  all over England, at one season or another, maypoles rose and Christmas  fires blazed? For Englishmen at heart are not only monarchists, but they  are lovers of good cheer and merrymaking and all sorts of mirth.    Charles II. might well at first have seemed a worthier and wiser  successor to his splendid father. As a child, even, he had shown himself  to be no faint-hearted creature. When the great Civil War broke out he  had joined his father's army. It met with disaster at Edgehill, and  was finally shattered by the crushing defeat of Naseby, which afterward  inspired Macaulay's most stirring ballad.    Charles was then only a child of twelve, and so his followers did wisely  in hurrying him out of England, through the Scilly isles and Jersey to  his mother's place of exile. Of course, a child so very young could be  of no value as a leader, though his presence might prove an inspiration.
