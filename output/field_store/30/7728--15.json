At midnight, with a beating heart, trembling hands, and a livid  countenance, he descended from the tree, took a ladder, leaned it  against the wall, mounted it to the last step but one, and listened.    All was perfectly quiet, not a sound broke the silence of the night; one  solitary light, that of the housekeeper, was burning in the house.    This silence and this darkness emboldened Boxtel; he got astride the  wall, stopped for an instant, and, after having ascertained that there  was nothing to fear, he put his ladder from his own garden into that of  Cornelius, and descended.    Then, knowing to an inch where the bulbs which were to produce the black  tulip were planted, he ran towards the spot, following, however, the  gravelled walks in order not to be betrayed by his footprints, and,  on arriving at the precise spot, he proceeded, with the eagerness of a  tiger, to plunge his hand into the soft ground.    He found nothing, and thought he was mistaken.    In the meanwhile, the cold sweat stood on his brow.    He felt about close by it,--nothing.    He felt about on the right, and on the left,--nothing.    He felt about in front and at the back,--nothing.    He was nearly mad, when at last he satisfied himself that on that very  morning the earth had been disturbed.    In fact, whilst Boxtel was lying in bed, Cornelius had gone down to his  garden, had taken up the mother bulb, and, as we have seen, divided it  into three.    Boxtel could not bring himself to leave the place. He dug up with his  hands more than ten square feet of ground.    At last no doubt remained of his misfortune. Mad with rage, he returned  to his ladder, mounted the wall, drew up the ladder, flung it into his  own garden, and jumped after it.    All at once, a last ray of hope presented itself to his mind: the  seedling bulbs might be in the dry-room; it was therefore only requisite  to make his entry there as he had done into the garden.    There he would find them, and, moreover, it was not at all difficult, as  the sashes of the dry-room might be raised like those of a greenhouse.  Cornelius had opened them on that morning, and no one had thought of  closing them again.    Everything, therefore, depended upon whether he could procure a ladder  of sufficient length,--one of twenty-five feet instead of ten.    Boxtel had noticed in the street where he lived a house which was being  repaired, and against which a very tall ladder was placed.    This ladder would do admirably, unless the workmen had taken it away.    He ran to the house: the ladder was there. Boxtel took it, carried it  with great exertion to his garden, and with even greater difficulty  raised it against the wall of Van Baerle's house, where it just reached  to the window.    Boxtel put a lighted dark lantern into his pocket, mounted the ladder,  and slipped into the dry-room.    On reaching this sanctuary of the florist he stopped, supporting himself  against the table; his legs failed him, his heart beat as if it would  choke him. Here it was even worse than in the garden; there Boxtel was  only a trespasser, here he was a thief.    However, he took courage again: he had not gone so far to turn back with  empty hands.    But in vain did he search the whole room, open and shut all the drawers,  even that privileged one where the parcel which had been so fatal to  Cornelius had been deposited; he found ticketed, as in a botanical  garden, the \"Jane,\" the \"John de Witt,\" the hazel-nut, and the  roasted-coffee coloured tulip; but of the black tulip, or rather the  seedling bulbs within which it was still sleeping, not a trace was  found.    And yet, on looking over the register of seeds and bulbs, which Van  Baerle kept in duplicate, if possible even with greater exactitude and  care than the first commercial houses of Amsterdam their ledgers, Boxtel  read these lines:--    \"To-day, 20th of August, 1672, I have taken up the mother bulb of the  grand black tulip, which I have divided into three perfect suckers.\"    \"Oh these bulbs, these bulbs!\" howled Boxtel, turning over everything in  the dry-room, \"where could he have concealed them?\"    Then, suddenly striking his forehead in his frenzy, he called out, \"Oh  wretch that I am! Oh thrice fool Boxtel! Would any one be separated from  his bulbs? Would any one leave them at Dort, when one goes to the Hague?  Could one live far from one's bulbs, when they enclose the grand black  tulip? He had time to get hold of them, the scoundrel, he has them about  him, he has taken them to the Hague!\"    It was like a flash of lightning which showed to Boxtel the abyss of a  uselessly committed crime.    Boxtel sank quite paralyzed on that very table, and on that very spot  where, some hours before, the unfortunate Van Baerle had so leisurely,  and with such intense delight, contemplated his darling bulbs.    \"Well, then, after all,\" said the envious Boxtel,--raising his livid  face from his hands in which it had been buried--\"if he has them, he can  keep them only as long as he lives, and----\"    The rest of this detestable thought was expressed by a hideous smile.    \"The bulbs are at the Hague,\" he said, \"therefore, I can no longer live  at Dort: away, then, for them, to the Hague! to the Hague!\"    And Boxtel, without taking any notice of the treasures about him, so  entirely were his thoughts absorbed by another inestimable treasure, let  himself out by the window, glided down the ladder, carried it back to  the place whence he had taken it, and, like a beast of prey, returned  growling to his house.          Chapter 9. The Family Cell      It was about midnight when poor Van Baerle was locked up in the prison  of the Buytenhof.    What Rosa foresaw had come to pass. On finding the cell of Cornelius  de Witt empty, the wrath of the people ran very high, and had Gryphus  fallen into the hands of those madmen he would certainly have had to pay  with his life for the prisoner.    But this fury had vented itself most fully on the two brothers when  they were overtaken by the murderers, thanks to the precaution which  William--the man of precautions--had taken in having the gates of the  city closed.    A momentary lull had therefore set in whilst the prison was empty, and  Rosa availed herself of this favourable moment to come forth from her  hiding place, which she also induced her father to leave.    The prison was therefore completely deserted. Why should people remain  in the jail whilst murder was going on at the Tol-Hek?    Gryphus came forth trembling behind the courageous Rosa. They went to  close the great gate, at least as well as it would close, considering  that it was half demolished. It was easy to see that a hurricane of  mighty fury had vented itself upon it.    About four o'clock a return of the noise was heard, but of no  threatening character to Gryphus and his daughter. The people were only  dragging in the two corpses, which they came back to gibbet at the usual  place of execution.    Rosa hid herself this time also, but only that she might not see the  ghastly spectacle.    At midnight, people again knocked at the gate of the jail, or rather  at the barricade which served in its stead: it was Cornelius van Baerle  whom they were bringing.    When the jailer received this new inmate, and saw from the warrant the  name and station of his prisoner, he muttered with his turnkey smile,--    \"Godson of Cornelius de Witt! Well, young man, we have the family cell  here, and we will give it to you.\"    And quite enchanted with his joke, the ferocious Orangeman took his  cresset and his keys to conduct Cornelius to the cell, which on that  very morning Cornelius de Witt had left to go into exile, or what in  revolutionary times is meant instead by those sublime philosophers who  lay it down as an axiom of high policy, \"It is the dead only who do not  return.\"    On the way which the despairing florist had to traverse to reach that  cell he heard nothing but the barking of a dog, and saw nothing but the  face of a young girl.    The dog rushed forth from a niche in the wall, shaking his heavy  chain, and sniffing all round Cornelius in order so much the better to  recognise him in case he should be ordered to pounce upon him.    The young girl, whilst the prisoner was mounting the staircase, appeared  at the narrow door of her chamber, which opened on that very flight of  steps; and, holding the lamp in her right hand, she at the same time  lit up her pretty blooming face, surrounded by a profusion of rich  wavy golden locks, whilst with her left she held her white night-dress  closely over her breast, having been roused from her first slumber by  the unexpected arrival of Van Baerle.    It would have made a fine picture, worthy of Rembrandt, the gloomy  winding stairs illuminated by the reddish glare of the cresset of  Gryphus, with his scowling jailer's countenance at the top, the  melancholy figure of Cornelius bending over the banister to look down  upon the sweet face of Rosa, standing, as it were, in the bright frame  of the door of her chamber, with embarrassed mien at being thus seen by  a stranger.    And at the bottom, quite in the shade, where the details are absorbed  in the obscurity, the mastiff, with his eyes glistening like carbuncles,  and shaking his chain, on which the double light from the lamp of Rosa  and the lantern of Gryphus threw a brilliant glitter.    The sublime master would, however, have been altogether unable to  render the sorrow expressed in the face of Rosa, when she saw this pale,  handsome young man slowly climbing the stairs, and thought of the full  import of the words, which her father had just spoken, \"You will have  the family cell.\"    This vision lasted but a moment,--much less time than we have taken to  describe it. Gryphus then proceeded on his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#14)"],[1,"revealed to the enemy some very secret preparations for the crossing      of the river Piave, and also supplied him with plans of the      organisation of troops, battery positions, etc.        \"The principal part in the treachery is attributed by the Italian high      command, not without reason, to Lieutenant Karel Stiny of an infantry      regiment, who deserted near Narenta. It appears from the detailed      Italian official report in which his statements are embodied, that he      betrayed all our preparations on the Piave and provided the enemy with      a great deal of most important information. Let us mention further that      Stiny in his mendacious statements to the Italian command about the      Austro-Hungarian situation at the front and in the interior, followed      the line of all traitors in order to appear in a favourable light. It      is characteristic that in his declaration about our offensive he said      that many Austro-Hungarian troops would have surrendered if it had not      been for the German and Bulgarian bayonets behind their backs.        \"_It is proved by various documents to what extent the Czechs have      forgotten their honour and duty_. By breaking their oath to Austria and      her emperor and king, they have also forgotten all those who were with      them at the front, and they are responsible for the blood of our      patriots and the sufferings of our prisoners in Italy. The false glory      which is attributed to them by the Italian command, who have lost all      sense of the immorality of these proceedings, cannot efface the eternal      crime which history always attaches to the names of traitors.\"    5. We could give many proofs of the great service the Czecho-Slovaks  rendered the Allies by their surrenders. But for our purpose it will be  sufficient to quote only some more admissions of the Germans and Magyars  themselves.    Count Tisza admitted that Czech troops could not be relied upon, and Count  Windischgraetz stated that the chief of staff dare not use them except when  mixed with Magyars and Germans.    Deputy Urmanczy declared in the Budapest Parliament on September 5, 1916,  that during the first encounters with Rumania, a Czech regiment retired  without the slightest resistance, provided themselves with provisions,  entered a train and disappeared. The men went over to Rumania. He blamed  the Czechs for the Austrian reverse in Transylvania.    On June 22, 1917, when the case of deputy Klofac was discussed by the  Immunity Committee of the Reichsrat, General von Georgi, Austrian Minister  for Home Defence, according to the Czech organ _Pozor_ of June  24, described        \"... the conditions prevailing in the army, especially the behaviour of      certain Czech regiments, and brought forward all the material which had      been collected against the Czechs since the outbreak of the war, and      which had been used against them. He referred to the 28th and 36th      Regiments as well as to eight other Czech regiments which had      voluntarily surrendered to the Russians. He mentioned also that Czech      officers, not only those in reserve but also those on active service,      including some of the highest ranks of the staff, surrendered to the      enemy; in one instance fourteen officers with a staff officer thus      surrendered. Czech soldiers in the Russian and French armies, as well      as in other enemy armies, are fighting for the Entente and constitute      legions and battalions of their own. The total number of Czechs in the      enemy armies exceeds 60,000. In the prisoners' camps in the enemy      countries, non-German prisoners were invited to join the enemy's ranks.      Czech legions and battalions are composed almost entirely of former      prisoners of war. The minister further went on to describe the      propaganda of the Czechs abroad, the activity of Czech committees in      enemy and neutral countries, especially in Russia and Switzerland. He      also mentioned the case of Pavlu, a Czech soldier, who in a Russian      newspaper described how he penetrated the Austrian trenches in the      uniform of an Austrian officer, annihilated the occupants and after a      successful scouting reconnaissance returned to the Russian ranks. The      minister described the attitude of the 'Sokols' and the Czech teachers.      The tenor of his speech was that Klofac is responsible for the      anti-Austrian feeling of the Czech nation and that therefore he should      not be released.\"    When the Russian offensive of July, 1917, started, Herr Hummer, member of  the Austrian Reichsrat, addressed the following interpellation to the  Austrian Minister for Home Defence:        \"Is the Austrian Minister for Home Defence aware that in one of the      early engagements of the new Russian offensive, the 19th Austrian      Infantry Division, which consists almost entirely of Czecho-Slovaks and      other Slavs, openly sided with the enemies of Austria by refusing to      fight against the Russians and by surrendering as soon as an      opportunity offered itself?\"    The most interesting document in regard to the attitude of Czecho-Slovaks  during the war is the interpellation of ninety German Nationalist deputies  (Schurf, Langenhahn, Wedra, Richter, Kittinger and others), of which we  possess a copy. It contains 420 large-size printed pages, and it is  therefore impossible for us to give a detailed account of it. The chapters  of this interpellation have the following headings:    1. The dangers of Pan-Slavistic propaganda.  2. The situation at the outbreak of the war.  3. Motives for the arrest of Kramar.  4. The behaviour of Czechs in Austria:      _(a)_ Demonstrations of Czech national spirit in Prague;      _(b)_ Czech school-books;      _(c)_ Czech officials;      _(d)_ The activities of the \"Sokols\";      _(e)_ What happened at Litomerice and elsewhere;      _(f)_ The Czech attitude towards war loans;      _(g)_ The Zivnostenska Banka and the war loans;      _(h)_ The financial policy of the Zivnostenska Banka;      _(i)_ The Czechs and war emergency affairs;      _(k)_ The Czechs and the question of food supplies.  5. The anti-Austrian attitude of Czechs abroad:      _(a)_ In France;      _(b)_ In England;      _(c)_ In Russia;      _(d)_ In America;      _(e)_ In Switzerland;      _(f)_ The campaign of Professor Masaryk;      _(g)_ The Czech secret intelligence service.  6. The conduct of Czech soldiers on the battlefield.  7. Military consequences.  8. Some recent documents.    According to the _Neue Freie Presse_ of June 6, 1918, the Austrian Minister  for Home Defence made the following important admissions in reply to the  part of this interpellation concerning the Czech contribution to the  defeats of Austria:        \"The 36th Regiment, according to unanimous reports of the high command,      failed to do its duty in May, 1915, on the Russian front, and thereby      caused a heavy defeat of other detachments. This regiment was dissolved      by the imperial decree of July 16, 1915.        \"The unsuccessful fighting and heavy losses of the 19th Division in the      battle north of Tarnopol between September 9 and 11, 1915, were caused      by the weak resistance of the 35th Regiment.... During the battles of      June 29 to July 2, 1917, near Zloczow the resistance offered by this      regiment was weak.        \"As regards Regiment No. 28 of Prague, according to the statement of      regimental commanders, it appears that the whole detachment, without      firing a single shot, was taken prisoner by a single enemy battalion,      or rather was brought by that battalion from its position.\"    And in this policy Czech soldiers continue by surrendering voluntarily to  the Entente troops whenever they have the opportunity.        VI    THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACTION OF THE CZECHO-SLOVAKS ABROAD    When war broke out, the Czecho-Slovaks all over the world felt it their  duty to prove by deeds that their place was on the side of the Entente. The  Czecho-Slovaks in Great Britain, France and Russia volunteered to fight for  the Allies, while in the United States of America, where there are some one  and a half million Czecho-Slovaks, they have counteracted German propaganda  and revealed German plots intended to weaken the American assistance to  the Allies.    1. In France 471 Czechs, _i.e._ over 60 per cent., entered the Foreign  Legion and greatly distinguished themselves by their bravery. The majority  of them have been mentioned in dispatches and received the Military Cross.  They have also won five crosses and twenty medals of the Russian Order of  St. George. Their losses amount to more than 70 per cent.    Further, many Czechs living in Great Britain at the outbreak of the war  joined the French Foreign Legion in France, and after His Majesty's  Government allowed Czechs to volunteer for service in the British army in  the autumn of 1916, practically all Czechs of military age resident in  Great Britain enrolled so far as they were not engaged on munitions. In  Canada, too, the Czechs joined the army in order to fight for the  British Empire.    The most important part was taken, however, by the Czecho-Slovak colonies  in Russia and America. In Russia, where there are large Czecho-Slovak  settlements, numbering several thousand, a Czecho-Slovak legion was formed  at the outbreak of the war which has rendered valuable services, especially  in scouting and reconnoitring. This legion grew gradually larger,  especially when Czech prisoners began to be allowed to join it, and  finally, under the direction of the Czecho-Slovak National Council, it was  formed into a regular army. In September, 1917, it had already two  divisions, and in 1918 fresh prisoners joined it, so that it counted  some 100,000.    In order to be able fully to appreciate this achievement, we must remember  that this was an army of volunteers, organised by the"]]]
