[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"all the West African people have  some such division, and they range upwards from three, as amongst  the Kru-men, the Gallas, the Wakwafi,and the Wanyika.[FN#11] 3.  Exogamy or the rigid interdiction of marriage between clans and  families nearly related; here again the Hindu and the Somal  observe the custom rigidly, whilst the Jews and Arabs have ever  taken to wife their first cousins. 4. Sacrifices with blood-  sprinkling upon altars and door-posts; a superstition almost  universal, found in Peru and Mexico as in Palestine, preserved in  Ashanti and probably borrowed by the Hebrews from the African  Egyptians. 5. The formal and ceremonial observance of new moons;  but the Wanyamwezi and other tribes also hail the appearance of  the lesser light, like the Moslems, who, when they sight the  Hilal (crescent), ejaculate a short prayer for blessings  throughout the month which it ushers in. 6. A specified time of  mourning for the dead (common to all barbarians as to civilized  races), during which their survivors wear soiled clothes (an  instinctive sign of grief, as fine dresses are of joy), and shave  their heads (doubtless done to make some difference from every-  day times), accompanied with ceremonial purifications (what  ancient people has not had some such whim?). 7. The system of  Runda or forbidden meats; but every traveller has found this  practice in South as in East Africa, and I noticed it among the  Somal who, even when starving, will not touch fish nor fowl.  Briefly, external resemblances and coincidences like these could  be made to establish cousinhood between a cockney and a cockatoo;  possibly such discovery of Judaism dates from the days about  1840, when men were mad to find the \"Lost Tribes,\" as if they had  not quite enough to do with the two which remain to them.    The Mpongwe and their neighbours have advanced a long step beyond  their black brethren in Eastern Africa. No longer contented with  mere Fetishes, the Egyptian charms in which the dreaded ghost  \"sits,\"[FN#12] meaning, is \"bound,\" they have invented idols, a  manifest advance toward that polytheism and pantheism which lead  through a triad and duad of deities to monotheism, the finial of  the spiritual edifice. In Eastern Africa I know but one people,  the Wanyika near Mombasah, who have certain images called  \"Kisukas;\" they declare that this great medicine, never shown to  Europeans, came from the West, and Andrew Battel (1600) found  idols amongst the people whom he calls Giagas or Jagas, meaning  Congoese chiefs. Moreover, the Gaboon pagans lodge their idols.  Behind each larger establishment there is a dwarf hut, the  miniature of a dwelling-place, carefully closed; I thought these  were offices, but Hotaloya Andrews taught me otherwise. He called  them in his broken English \"Compass-houses,\" a literal  translation of \"Nágo Mbwiri,\" and, sturdily refusing me  admittance, left me as wise as before. The reason afterwards  proved to be that \"Ologo he kill man too much.\"    I presently found out that he called my pocket compass, \"Mbwiri,\"  a very vague and comprehensive word. It represents in the highest  signification the Columbian Manitou, and thus men talk of the  Mbwiri of a tree or a river; as will presently be seen, it is  also applied to a tutelar god; and I have shown how it means a  ghost. In \"Nágo Mbwiri\" the sense is an idol, an object of  worship, a \"medicine\" as the North-American Indians say, in  contradistinction to Munda, a grigri, talisman, or charm. Every  Mpongwe, woman as well as man, has some Mbwiri to which offerings  are made in times of misfortune, sickness, or danger. I  afterwards managed to enter one of these rude and embryonal  temples so carefully shut. Behind the little door of matting is a  tall threshold of board; a bench lines the far end, and in the  centre stands \"Ologo,\" a rude imitation of a human figure, with a  gum-torch planted in the ground before it ready for burnt  offerings. To the walls are suspended sundry mystic implements,  especially basins, smeared with red and white chalk-mixture, and  wooden crescents decorated with beads and ribbons.    During worship certain objects are placed before the Joss, the  suppliant at the same time jangling and shaking the Ncheke a rude  beginning of the bell, the gong, the rattle, and the instruments  played before idols by more advanced peoples. It is a piece of  wood, hour-glass-shaped but flat, and some six inches and a half  long; the girth of the waist is five inches, and about three more  round the ends. The wood is cut away, leaving rude and uneven  raised bands horizontally striped with white, black, and red. Two  brass wires are stretched across the upper and lower breadth, and  each is provided with a ring or hinge holding four or five strips  of wire acting as clappers.    This \"wicker-work rattle to drive the devil out\" (M. du Chaillu,  chap, xxvi.) is called by the Mpongwe \"Soke,\" and serves only,  like that of the Dahomans and the Ashantis (Bowdich, 364) for  dancing and merriment. The South American Maraca was the sole  object of worship known to the Tupi or Brazilian \"Indians.\"  [FN#13]    The beliefs and superstitions popularly attributed to the Mpongwe  are these. They are not without that which we call a First Cause,  and they name it Anyambia, which missionary philologists consider  a contraction of Aninla, spirit (?), and Mbia, good. M. du  Chaillu everywhere confounds Anyambía, or, as he writes the word,  \"Aniambié,\" with Inyemba, a witch, to bewitch being \"punga  inyemba.\" Mr. W. Winwood Reade seems to make Anyambía a  mysterious word, as was Jehovah after the date of the Moabite  stone. Like the Brahm of the Hindus, the god of Epicurus and  Confucius, and the Akárana-Zaman or Endless Time of the Guebres,  Anyambia is a vague being, a vox et præterea nihil, without  personality, too high and too remote for interference in human  affairs, therefore not addressed in prayer, never represented by  the human form, never lodged in temples. Under this \"unknown God\"  are two chief agencies, working partners who manage the business  of the world, and who effect what the civilized call  \"Providence.\" Mbwírí here becomes the Osiris, Jove, Hormuzd or  Good God, the Vishnu, or Preserver, a tutelar deity, a Lar, a  guardian. Onyámbe is the Bad God, Typhon, Vejovis, the Ahriman or  Semitic devil; Shiva the Destroyer, the third person of the Aryan  triad; and his name is never mentioned but with bated breath.  They have not only fear of, but also a higher respect for him  than for the giver of good, so difficult is it for the child-  man's mind to connect the ideas of benignity and power. He would  harm if he could, ergo so would his god. I once hesitated to  believe that these rude people had arrived at the notion of  duality, at the Manichaeanism which caused Mr. Mill (sen.)  surprise that no one had revived it in his time; at an idea so  philosophical, which leads directly to the ne plus ultra of  faith, El Wahdaníyyeh or Monotheism. Nor should I have credited  them with so logical an apparatus for the regimen of the  universe, or so stout-hearted an attempt to solve the eternal  riddle of good and evil. But the same belief also exists amongst  the Congoese tribes, and even in the debased races of the Niger.  Captain William Alien (\"Niger Expedition,\" i. 227) thus records  the effect when, at the request of the commissioners, Herr Schon,  the missionary, began stating to King Obi the difference between  the Christian religion and heathenism:    \"Herr Schön. There is but one God.    \"King Obi. I always understood there were two,\" &c.    The Mpongwe \"Mwetye\" is a branch of male freemasonry into which  women and strangers are never initiated. The Bakele and Shekyani,  according to \"Western Africa\" (Wilson, pp. 391-2), consider it a  \"Great Spirit.\" Nothing is more common amongst adjoining negro  tribes than to annex one another's superstitions, completely  changing, withal, their significance. \"Ovengwá\" is a vampire, the  apparition of a dead man; tall as a tree, always winking and  clearly seen, which is not the case with the Ibámbo and Ilogo,  plurals of Obambo and Ologo. These are vulgar ghosts of the  departed, the causes of \"possession,\" disease and death; they are  propitiated by various rites, and everywhere they are worshipped  in private. Mr. Wilson opines that the \"Obambo are the spirits of  the ancestors of the people, and Inlâgâ are the spirits of  strangers and have come from a distance,\" but this was probably  an individual tenet. The Mumbo-Jumbo of the Mandengas; the Semo  of the Súsús; the Tassau or \"Purrah-devil\" of the Mendis; the  Egugun of the Egbas; the Egbo of the Duallas; and the Mwetye and  Ukukwe of the Bakele, is represented in Pongo-land by the Ndá,  which is an order of the young men. Ndá dwells in the woods and  comes forth only by night bundled up in dry plantain  leaves[FN#14] and treading on tall stilts; he precedes free adult  males who parade the streets with dance and song. The women and  children fly at the approach of this devil on two sticks, and  with reason: every peccadillo is punished with a merciless  thrashing. The institution is intended to keep in order the  weaker sex, the young and the \"chattels:\" Ndá has tried visiting  white men and missionaries, but his visits have not been a  success.    The civilized man would be apt to imagine that these wild African  fetishists are easily converted to a \"purer creed.\" The contrary  is everywhere and absolutely the case; their faith is a web woven  with threads of iron. The negro finds it almost impossible to rid  himself of his belief; the spiritual despotism is the expression  of his organization, a part of himself. Progressive races, on the  other hand, can throw off or exchange every part of their  religion, except perhaps the remnant of original and natural  belief in things unseen--in fact, the Fetishist portion, such as  ghost-existence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"has the Persian letter Zh (j), sounding like the initial  of the French \"jour:\" so Lander (\"On the Course and Termination  of the Niger,\" \"Journal Royal Geographical Society,\" vol. i. p.  131) says of the Island Zegozhe, that \"zh is pronounced like z in  azure.\" This upright mass, apparently 40 feet high, and seeming,  like the \"Lumba\" of Kinsembo to rest upon a basement, is very  conspicuous from the east, where it catches the eye as a watch-  tower would. At the bluff-base, a huge slab, an irregular  parallelogram, slopes towards the water and, viewed far up  stream, it passably represents a Kaffir's pavoise. This Fingal's  Shield, a name due to the piety of Mr. George Maxwell, is called  by the French La Pierre Fétiche: it must not be confounded with  our Fetish Rock (Tádi ya Muingu) on the southern bank at the  entrance of the Nshibúl and Sonho branches. I can add nothing to  Tuckey's description or Lieutenant Hawkey's tracing of the rude  figures which distinguish a not unusual feature. Tuckey (p. 97)  calls Fingal's Shield Taddy d'ya M'wangoo, and Professor Smith,  Taddi Moenga (p. 303); the only defect in Lieutenant Hawkey's  sketch is that of exaggerating the bluff, a mere mamelon, one of  many lumps upon a continued level. Both rocks are of the oldest  granite, much weather-worn and mixed and banded with mica and  quartz. M. Charles Konig found in the finer-grained varieties  \"minute noble garnets,\" which also appeared in the mica-slate of  \"Gombac\" higher up stream, and in the primitive greenstone of  \"Boka Embomma.\"[FN#8]    Beyond this point, where Boma is first sighted, lies the large  marauding village of Twáná. Here also a man shouted to us from  the bank \"Muliele! muliele!\" for the Portuguese \"mulher,\" one of  the interminable corruptions of the tongue--a polite offer, as  politely declined. The next feature is the Rio Jo Jacaré, a  narrow sedgy stream on the right bank, which, winding northward  through rolling lines of hills, bends westward, and joins, they  say, the Rio Lukullu (Lukallo?) of Cabinda Bay. Men have  descended, I am told, three leagues, but no one has seen the  junction, consequently there may be a portage between the drains.  If not, this is the apex of the greater Congo delta, a false  formation, whose base between Cabinda Bay (S. lat. 5° 25') and  Ambrizette (S. lat. 7° 16') measures 1° 51', equal to 111 direct  geographical miles, whilst its depth inland would be sixty.                                      Chapter Vii.                   Boma.--our Outfit for the Interior        We now reach Boma, the furthest Portuguese factory, about thirty,  usually reckoned thirty-eight, nautical miles from Porta da  Lenha, and a total of 52.50 from French Point.    The upper dépôt of the Congo lies upon the north bank, accidenté  ground, poor, stony, and sandy soil, with rounded, grass-clad  hills, The southern is less broken; there are long slopes and  waves of land which trend in graceful lines, charmingly  diversified, to the uplands, where the old capital, São Salvador,  is situated; and upon the undulating blue ridges, distance behind  distance, appear markings by Nature's hand, which the stranger's  eye can hardly distinguish from villa or village. The view  explains how the old expedition felt \"every day more in love with  this beautiful country,\" The sea-like river wants nothing but  cattle on its banks to justify the description--                \"Appunto una scena pastorale, a cui fanno             Quinci il mar, quinci i colli, e d' ogn' intorno             I fior, le piante, e l' ombre, e l' onde, e l cielo.             Unteatro pomposo.\"    In the centre of the broad stream, whose southern arm is not  visible, are three islets. The western most, backed by a long,  grassy, palm-tasselled bank, is called Zungá chyá Bundiká. This  Chombae Island of the charts is a rocky cone, dark with umbrella-  shaped trees. Its north-eastern neighbour, Simúle Kete, the  Molyneux Island of Mr. Maxwell, the Hekay of Tuckey, and the  Kekay of the chart, contrasts sharply with the yellow stubbles  and the flat lines of Zungá chyá Ngándi. Here, since Tuckey's  time, the trees have made way for grass and stones; the only  remnants are clumps in the south-eastern, which is not only the  highest point, but also the windy and watery direction. On the  Congo course the foul weather is mostly from the \"sirocco,\" where  the African interior is a mass of swamps. At the mouth tornadoes  come down the line of stream from the north-east, and I heard  traditions of the sea-tornado, which blows in shore instead of  offshore as usual. About the close of the last century one or  other of these islands was proposed as a dépôt and settlement,  which a few simple works would convert into a small Gibraltar.  The easternmost Buka, the Booka Embomma of the charts and maps,  will presently be described. In this direction the Zaire assumes  the semblance of a mountain lake, whilst down stream the broad  bosom of the Nshibúl branch forms almost a sea-horizon, with dots  showing where tall, scattered palms spring from the watery  surface. We cannot but admire the nightly effects of the wintry  bush-fires. During the day livid volumed smoke forms cumuli that  conceal their enemy, the sun, and discharge a rain of blacks ten  times the size of Londoners. In the darkened air we see storms of  fire fiercely whirling over the undulating ranges, here sweeping  on like torrents, there delaying, whilst the sheets meet at the  apex, and a giant beard of flame (<Greek>                  )  flouts the moon. The land must be splendidly grassed after the  rains.    The Boma factories are like those of Porto da Lenha, but humbler  in size, and more resembling the wicker-work native houses. The  river, which up stream will show a flood mark of twelve feet,  here seldom rises above five, and further down three and four;  consequently piles are not required, and the swiftness of the  current keeps off the jacaré. Formerly there were fourteen  establishments, which licit trade in palm oil and ground-nuts,  instead of men, women, and children, have reduced to ten. The air  is sensibly drier and healthier than at the lower settlement, and  apparently there is nothing against the place but deadly ennui  and monotony.    We landed at once, and presented our letters to Sr. Antonio  Vicente Pereira, who at once made us at home: he had seen Goa as  well as Macáo, so we found several subjects in common. The  factory enjoyed every comfort: the poultry yard throve, far  better than at Porto da Lenha; we saw fowls and pigeons,  \"Manilla\" ducks and ducklings, and a fine peacock from Portugal,  which seemed to enjoy the change. The fish is not so good as that  caught further down, and the natives have a habit of narcotizing  it: the Silurus electricus is exceptionally plentiful. The  farmyard contained tame deer, and a house-dog fierce as a  tethered mastiff; goats were brought whenever wanted, and the  black-faced, thin-tailed sheep gave excellent mutton. Beef was  impossible; the Portuguese, like the natives, care little for  milk, and of the herd, which strangers had attempted to  domesticate, remained only a bull and a cow in very poor  condition--the deaths were attributed to poisonous grass, but I  vehemently suspect Tsetse. A daily \"quitanda,\" or market, held  under the huge calabashes on a hill behind the house, supplied  what was wanted.    Upon Market Hill executions also take place, the criminal being  shot through the heart. M. Pereira's garden produces all that  Porta da Lenha can grow, with less trouble and of a superior  kind. Water-melons, tomatoes, onions, and pimento, or large  pepper (pimentão, siliquastrum, ndungu ya yenéne), useful to  produce \"crocodiles' tears;\" mint, and parsley flourish  remarkably; turnips are eatable after two months; cabbage and  lettuce, beet, carrot, and endive after three or four. It is a  waste of ground to plant peas; two rows, twelve feet by four,  hardly produce a plateful. Manioc ripens between the sixth and  ninth month, plantains and bananas once a year, cotton and rice  in four months, and maize in forty days--with irrigation it is  easy to grow three annual crops. The time for planting is before  the rains, which here last six weeks to two months, September and  October. The staple of commerce is now the nguba, or ground-nut  (plural, jinguba), which Merolla calls incumba, with sometimes a  little milho (maize), and Calavance beans. Of fruits we find  trellised grapes, pines, and guavas, which, as at Fernando Po,  are a weed. The agrumi, limes, oranges and citrons are remarkably  fine, and hold, as of old, a high place in the simple medicines  of the country. A cup of lime-leaf tea, drunk warm in the  morning, is the favourite emetic and cathartic: even in Pliny's  day we find \"Malus Assyria, quam alii vocant medicam (Mediam?,  venenis medetur\" (xii. 7). On the Gold Coast and in the Gaboon  region, colic and dysentery are cured by a calabash full of lime-  juice, \"laced\" with red pepper. The peculiarity of European  vegetables throughout maritime Congo and Angola is the absence of  all flavour combined with the finest appearance; it seems as  though something in the earth or atmosphere were wanting to their  full development. Similarly, though in the upper regions the  climate is delicious, the missionaries could not keep themselves  alive, but died of privation, hardship, and fatigue.                                     Chapter VIII.                       A Visit to Banza Chisalla,        Boma, at the head of the Congo delta, the great dépôt between the  interior and the coast, owes its existence wholly to                        \"the cruel trade             Which spoils unhappy Afric of her sons.\"    Father Merolla (1682), who visited it from \"Angoij,\" our  \"Cabinda,\" speaks of it as a pretty large island, tributary to  the Mani-Congo, extremely populous, well supplied with  provisions,"]]]
