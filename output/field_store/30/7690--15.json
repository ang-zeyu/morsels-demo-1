Other works also  show the influence of Japanese scholarship.    Among the publications have appeared two magazines. One published at  Ningpo, is called \"New Buddhism.\" This is struggling and may have to  succumb. The other is known as the \"Sound of the Sea Tide,\" now  published in Hankow. Moreover, in all the large cities there are  Buddhist bookshops where only Buddhist works are sold. These all report  a good business. This literary activity reveals an interest among the  reading classes of China. Few such books are purchased by the monks. The  Chinese scholars read them for their style and for their deep  philosophy, but also for light and for help in the present distracting  political situation of their country.    _(d) Lectures._--Along with publication goes the spread of Buddhism  by lectures in the monasteries and the cities of China. A few years ago  Buddhist sermons, however serious, were only listened to by monks and by  a few pious devotees. Today such addresses are advertised and are  usually well attended by the intellectuals. Often many women are found  listening. Monks like T'ai Hsü and Yuan Ying have a national reputation.  Not only monks, but laymen trained in Japan are delivering lectures on  the Buddhist sutras. The favorites are the Awakening of Faith and the  Suddharma Pundarika sutra.    _(e) Buddhist Societies._--With the lectures goes the organization  of Buddhist societies for all sorts of purposes. There is a central  society in Peking which has branches in every province. The connection  is rather loose. Buddhism has never been in favor of centralization. Nor  for that matter would the government have allowed it. The chief ends  aimed at by these societies are fellowship, devotion, study,  propagation, and service. Such societies, often short lived, are  springing up in many quarters. They meet for lectures on Buddhism or to  conduct a study class in some of the sutras. Occasionally the more  ambitious conduct an institute for several months. Some spend part of  the time in meditation together. Several schools for children are  supported by these societies. They also encourage work of a religious  nature among prisoners, distributing tracts and holding services. Such  activities are especially appreciated by those who are to suffer the  death penalty. The societies are also doing publishing work. The two  magazines are supported by the members of the larger societies.    _(f) Signs of Social Ambition._--Social work is a prominent feature  of some of these Buddhist societies. They have raised money for famine  stricken regions, have opened orphanages, and assist in Red Cross work.  One of the largest Chinese institutions for ministering to people who  are sick and in trouble is located at Hankow. Around a central Buddhist  temple is a modern-built hospital, an orphanage and several schools for  poor children. It may not maintain western standards of efficiency, but  it certainly represents the outreach of modern Buddhism.    Perhaps their most far-reaching advance has been made because of the  realization that leaders are needed and that they must be trained.  Several schools for this purpose have sprung into existence. Such  schools are necessarily very primitive and are struggling with the  difficulties of finding an adequate staff and equipment and of obtaining  the best type of students.    Another sign of new life has been the making of programs for the future  development of Buddhism. One of the most comprehensive appeared a short  time ago. For the individual it proposes the cultivation of love, mercy,  equality, freedom, progressiveness, an established faith, patience and  endurance. For all men it proposes (1) an education according to  capacity; (2) a trade suited to ability; (3) an opportunity to develop  one's powers; (4) a chance for enlightenment for all. For society it  urges the cultivation of cooperation, social service, sacrifice for the  social weal, and the social consciousness in the individual. On behalf  of the country it urges patriotism, participation in the government, and  cooperation in international movements. For the world it advocates  universal progress. As to the universe it specifies as a goal the  bringing of men into harmony with spiritual realities, the enlightenment  of all and the realization of the spiritual universe.    A Buddhist writer sums up the aims of new Buddhism as follows:    \"Formerly Buddhism desired to escape the sinful world. Today Buddhism  not only desires to escape this world of sin, but longs to transform  this world of sin into a new world dominated by the ideals of Buddhism.  Formerly Buddhism was occupied with erecting and perfecting its  doctrines and polity as an organization. Today it not only hopes to  perfect the doctrines and polity, but desires to spread the doctrines  and ideals abroad so as to help mankind to become truly cultured.\"    _4. The Attitude of Tibetan Lamas_    Not only the Chinese Buddhists, but the Lamas of Mongolia and Tibet are  feeling the impulses of the new age. Quite recently an exhibition was  held in the Lama temple at Peking which attracted thousands of visitors.  Its object was to obtain money to repair the temple, and thus to give  its work a fresh impulse. That these impulses are not necessarily  hostile to Christianity is shown by a letter written by the Kurung  Tsering Lama of Kokonor district to the Rev. T. Sörensen of Szechuan:    \"I, your humble servant, have seen several copies of the Scriptures and,  having read them carefully, they certainly made me believe in Christ. I  understand a little of the outstanding principles and the doctrinal  teaching of the One Son, but as to the Holy Spirit's nature and essence,  and as to the origin of this religion, I am not at all clear, and it is  therefore important that the doctrinal principles of this religion  should be fully explained, so as to enlighten the unintelligent and  people of small mental ability.    \"The teaching of the science of medicine and astrology is also very  important. It is therefore evident if we want this blessing openly  manifested, we must believe in the religion of the only Son of God.  Being in earnest, I therefore pray you from my heart not to consider  this letter lightly. With a hundred salutations.\"    Enclosed with this letter was a poem written in most elegant language.    \"O thou Supreme God and most precious Father, The truth above all  religions, The Ruler of all animate and inanimate worlds! Greater than  wisdom, separated from birth and death, Is his son Christ the Lord  shining in glory among endless beings. Incomprehensible wonder,  miraculously made! In this teaching I myself also believe--As your  spirit is with heaven united, My soul undivided is seeking the truth  Jesus the Savior's desire fulfilling, For the coming of the Kingdom of  Heaven I am praying. Happiness to all.\"    _5. The Buddhist World Versus the Christian World_    Looking back over the last twenty-five years we see rising quite  distinctly a Buddhist world growing conscious of itself, of its past  history and of its mission to the world. This Buddhist, world has much  more of a program than it had twenty-five years ago. Its object is to  unite the Mahayâna and the Hînayâna branches of Buddhism and to spread  Buddhist propaganda over the world. At present the leadership of this  movement is in Japan. It is in part a political movement. There is no  question that Christianity is not at all pleasing to the Japanese  militarists. It is regarded by them as the advance post of western  industrialism and political ambition. Quite naturally such leaders  desire to make the Buddhist world a unit. It is also a social movement.  The spirit of the Japanese Buddhist has been brought to consciousness by  the new position of Japan. Japan is seeking to take its place in the  world as a first rate power. By this not only will Japan's industry and  commerce profit, but its spiritual values must also be adapted to the  world. The movement then has its spiritual side. Japanese travelers and  people are going to all parts of the world. They carry with them the  religious ideals which have been shaped by Buddhism. Buddhism in the  past was one of the great religions of salvation with an inspiring  missionary message. It is again awakening to this task of  evangelization. Under the leadership of Japanese scholars and religious  statesmen the Japanese are seeking to unite the Buddhist world so that  it shall become a force in the new world. Japan is thus trying to give  back what it has received in the past.    At present in Buddhist countries there is a strong force working against  this movement. Nationalism is a new force to be reckoned with. Still  even with the spirit of nationalism permeating every group, the Buddhist  world is getting together and will strive to make its contribution to  the life of the whole world.          X      THE CHRISTIAN APPROACH TO BUDDHISTS    _1. Questions Which Buddhists Ask_    Buddhists are approaching Christianity. In many places a spirit of  inquiry and interest in the Christian religion is met. It is not  necessary that there should be a Buddhist world permanently over against  a Christian world. The questions which Buddhists ask a missionary  indicate an interest in vital themes. Some of them are as follows:    We put our trust in the three Precious Ones. In what do you trust? Is  not your Shang Ti (name for God used in China) a being lower than Buddha  and just a little higher than a Bodhisattva? Is not Shang Ti the tribal  god of the Jews? Do you believe in the existence of _purgatory?_  What sufferings will those endure who do not live a virtuous life? Do  you believe in the reality of the Western Paradise? How can one enter  it? There being three kinds of merit, by what method is the great merit  accumulated?

Farhan, who was with me, delighted at the prospect of showing his  skill in any manner--for he styled himself professor of all things--at  once took the hint, and bargained to do a day's work, and furnish him  with some wrinkles for his future guidance, for the payment of a goat,  which was readily agreed to.    The people here were highly superstitious, and, like all ignorant  races, very punctilious in their ceremonies of worship. As _true_  Mussulmans, they were constant in their time of prayer, and abused my  interpreter for never saying his. When I made him cut the deer's  throats a little lower down the throat than their canons permit, to  save the specimen, they spat on the ground to show their contempt, and  abused him heartily. If I threw date-stones in the fire (the seed of  paradisiacal food), they looked upon it as a sacrilege. They were also  very suspicious. If I walked up and down the same place to stretch my  legs, they formed councils of war on my motives, considering I must  have some secret designs upon their country, or I would not do it, as  no man in his senses could be guilty of working his legs  unnecessarily.    Considering all the northerners were said to have been driven up here  by the war, I was much surprised to see so few habitations or flocks  in the valley; all there were consisted in a few kraals scattered over  the plain, which were constantly moved as soon as each plot of ground  in turn was eaten up by the cattle. In changing ground, these nomads  pack up everything on their camels, mat and stick, hut and all, and  placing the wife, with perhaps a baby also, on a donkey, march to any  unoccupied watering-place they can find. Their food is very limited,  except in the rainy season, when milk prevails: in consequence of  this, it being now the dry season, my servants accounted for their  increasing appetite for my dates. Some of the poorer men are said to  pass their whole lives without tasting any flesh or grain, but to live  entirely on sour milk, wild honey, or gums, as they may chance to come  across them, and they are almost naked; but notwithstanding this,  disease is scarcely known, and excepting in a few cases of endemic  ophthalmia, which appears to attack the country periodically, at  intervals of two or three years, I never heard of any. The climate was  very delightful at this season, and the nights so cold I had to wrap  myself well up in flannels. But perhaps that which best illustrates  the healthiness of the country and pleasantness of its atmosphere, is  the fact that I, although I had no bedstead, but always slept on the  ground, never pitched my tent a single day in the interior, and  neither wore a hat or shoe throughout the journey, save on one or two  occasions, when, severely stabbed with thorns, I put on a sandal. I  never knew a moment's illness.    25th.--This evening, Husayn Hadji, who I now found out was  brother-in-law to Sumunter, approached me as I came in from shooting,  and said, \"We are surprised to see you return alive; did you not meet  some armed men when you were shooting?\" I replied, \"No, not one.\"  \"Then,\" said he, \"there are many men come here, who from the first  have forbid your coming into this country; they are under no control,  but, in open defiance of the Gerad, do and act just as they like:  indeed, every head man is a Gerad here, and those who are strongest  carry the day.\" This was the prelude to another farce; presently the  men came of whom Husayn Hadji spoke, and, surrounding my camp,  boisterously demanded to know what I was doing in their country  against their orders. A violent altercation then ensued. They must  have all my property given up at once, or they would take it by force;  and remained trying to bully me into compliance, until I said I would  sooner die than give them anything. Seeing me determined, they then  walked off, saying I had not one night left to live, for they would  return and kill me after dark. The place was now getting too hot to be  pleasant, for the fact was, we were so near the watering-place, that  my camp offered a convenient and tempting lounge for all the idle  blackguards of the country to assemble at.    26th.--I sent orders back for the rear traps to come on as quick as  possible, and at the suggestion of my servants, who were just as tired  as myself of these incessant provocations, changed camp to a place  three miles farther up the valley, much more remote from water, but  nearer to the Abban's home, by which I hoped I should be able to get  at him easier; for the aggravating wretch, whenever I sent messages to  recall him, invariably returned plausible excuses, showing the  necessity of his having stopped away, and as repeatedly said he would  not fail in coming immediately; but at the same time, as the sequence  showed, never intending to do so.    It would be useless, as well as painful, to narrate in detail all the  daily and hourly incidents which occurred in the next few days whilst  I was detained here by the artful and dishonest machinations of this  vile-conditioned man, from whom I could never get one true word, and  whose absence, although I was striving to induce his coming to me,  really seemed a relief. A wicked feeling was almost coming over me,  which made me shudder again when I reflected more calmly on what my  mind was now dilating. He seemed to me only as an animal in satanical  disguise; to have shot him would have given me great relief, for I  fairly despaired of ever producing any good effect upon his mind.  Again I tried the old scheme of forcing him to leave me, and even  begged an Akil of the Dulbahantas, offering him large rewards, to be  my guide to Berbera. This, as might be imagined, provoked a severe  row. The man I was endeavouring to seduce to favour me was one of the  gang of forty thieves, and as birds of a feather all Dulbahantas  flocked together to assist the victim of my displeasure; for Sumunter  was, by his intermarriage with these northerners, naturalised amongst  them. However, I had my wicked will, by relating, in presence of all  his now rapidly congregating friends (a row always brings a crowd),  the whole of his misdemeanours since he first came with me to this  country, and threatened him with the lasting displeasure of our  Government, and ruin to his trade at Aden, if he still persisted in  his tricks. This brought matters home much closer than anybody liked  to hear, and set all parties cogitating on what course had best be  followed. I now retired to cool myself by shooting, and on returning  again was met by the Abban, interpreter, and many Dulbahanta Akils,  who, now trying the conciliating dodge, came to report the good news  that a victory had been gained by the northerners, and the southerners  were in full retreat to their provinces, by which the road to Berbera  would be open to my proceeding onwards. Moreover, the rear traps had  arrived at Abi, by which accident everything seemed to harmonise. This  sounded very cheering for the moment, but I soon was damped again.    I wanted to move at once, and lose no time in taking full benefit of  the opportunity thus offered; but this, like every other proposal that  I made, was immediately checked by a cruel device, as unforeseen as it  was objectionable. Hassan had not come with the ponies he went after  from Rhut Tug; I must therefore, before advancing, send back to the  farther frontier of the Warsingali to purchase, by bills on Aden, five  ponies at thirty dollars a-head, to be afterwards given away in  presents to chiefs on the road for allowing me to pass through their  territories, and this, at a minimum calculation, would occupy a  fortnight's time, and even then I should have to go single-handed,  without a servant, instrument, or article of any bulk with me. Of  course this, as the Abban knew, I never would consent to. On no  account would I suffer my being separated from my men and property  when the time for my return to Berbera was so close at hand; and,  moreover, without the instruments the journey would be of no avail.  Row succeeded row when I pushed matters closely; the Abban sometimes  affected repentance, but more often became defiant, and forbade  anybody's assisting me without his entire consent. Such, in fact, were  the effects of these angry ebullitions of temper on the minds of my  people, that the young Prince Abdullah, fearing to be witness to them  any more, took his leave and departed home.    31st.--At length the rear traps arrived, but one camel, having been  taken ill on the march this morning whilst coming from Abi, was  slaughtered to \"_save_\" his flesh, and devoured by my hungry men. As  soon as everything had arrived, and the men were made aware of my  intention to push forward, they requested their discharge, affecting  fear to enter on a strange land, but in reality seeing I had no cloths  left to pay them, as afterwards transpired. This deficiency I visited  on the Abban, who, in trying to excuse himself for inefficiency in his  protectorship, meekly said he had been grieved to see the very rapid  decline of my property, but he could not help it, as I had so many  thieves in my employment!!! Mrs Awado now came over from Birhamir,  bringing a sheep and some ghee as a present for me; but I refused  taking anything from the relative of the Abban, and this appeared to  grieve her much. She said she had heard of all my disputes with  Sumunter, her son, and had remonstrated with him about them; he was a  proud man, and easily led away by vanity. She could see his being at  variance with me would not end to his advantage on his return to Aden,  and tried coaxing him to journey with me; but at the same time told me  he would have to be well upon his guard, as in former years he had  married clandestinely with a"]]]
