The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his  newspaper--\"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10s. reward.\" He looked  suspiciously at Pig-wig. Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for  the ploughman.    \"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him,\" said the grocer,  gathering up the reins. He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such  a VERY lame pig could never run!    \"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back.\" The grocer did so; he saw the two  pigs stock-still in the middle of the road. Then he looked over at his  horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out,  after he got to the ploughman.    \"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!\" said Pigling Bland.    Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran! They raced and squealed and  pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge. Little fat Pig-wig's  petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she  bounded and jumped.    They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short  cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.    They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in  hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!    THE END          THE TALE OF TWO BAD MICE    FOR W. M. L. W. THE LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD THE DOLL HOUSE      ONCE upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house; it was red  brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front  door and a chimney.    IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged  to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.    Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had  been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.    THERE were two red lobsters, and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some  pears and oranges.    They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.    ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's  perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet.  Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner  near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.    Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.    Tom Thumb was a mouse.    A MINUTE afterwards Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and  when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on  the oilcloth under the coal-box.    THE doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace. Tom Thumb and  Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug. They pushed the front  door--it was not fast.    TOM THUMB and Hunca Munca went up-stairs and peeped into the  dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!    Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons,  and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!    TOM THUMB set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny  yellow, streaked with red.    The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.    \"It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.\"    HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another  lead knife.    \"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,\" said Hunca Munca.    THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.    \"Let it alone,\" said Tom Thumb; \"give me some fish, Hunca Munca!\"    HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the  dish.    Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the  floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash,  smash!    The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made  of nothing but plaster!    THEN there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and  Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears, and the  oranges.    As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot  crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.    TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top--there  was no soot.    WHILE Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another  disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled  \"Rice,\" \"Coffee\" \"Sago\"; but when she turned them upside down there was  nothing inside except red and blue beads.    THEN those mice set to work to do all the mischief they  could--especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of  drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top-floor window.    But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out  of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a  feather-bed.    WITH Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and  across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the  mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.    THEN Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a bird-cage,  and several small odds and ends. The bookcase and the bird-cage refused  to go into the mouse-hole.    HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.    HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there  was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to  their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.    WHAT a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!    Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane leaned  against the kitchen dresser and smiled; but neither of them made any  remark.    THE bookcase and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box; but  Hunca Munca has got the cradle and some of Lucinda's clothes.    SHE also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.    THE little girl that the doll's house belonged to said: \"I will get a  doll dressed like a policeman!\"    BUT the nurse said: \"I will set a mouse-trap!\"    SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice. But they were not so very,  very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.    He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve  he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and  Jane.    AND very early every morning--before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca  comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#14)"],[1,"accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to  logic and arithmetic. To say that logic and arithmetic are contributed  by us does not account for this. Our nature is as much a fact of the  existing world as anything, and there can be no certainty that it will  remain constant. It might happen, if Kant is right, that to-morrow  our nature would so change as to make two and two become five. This  possibility seems never to have occurred to him, yet it is one which  utterly destroys the certainty and universality which he is anxious  to vindicate for arithmetical propositions. It is true that this  possibility, formally, is inconsistent with the Kantian view that time  itself is a form imposed by the subject upon phenomena, so that our  real Self is not in time and has no to-morrow. But he will still have  to suppose that the time-order of phenomena is determined by  characteristics of what is behind phenomena, and this suffices for the  substance of our argument.    Reflection, moreover, seems to make it clear that, if there is any truth  in our arithmetical beliefs, they must apply to things equally whether  we think of them or not. Two physical objects and two other physical  objects must make four physical objects, even if physical objects cannot  be experienced. To assert this is certainly within the scope of what  we mean when we state that two and two are four. Its truth is just as  indubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two  other phenomena make four phenomena. Thus Kant's solution unduly limits  the scope of _a priori_ propositions, in addition to failing in the  attempt at explaining their certainty.    Apart from the special doctrines advocated by Kant, it is very common  among philosophers to regard what is _a priori_ as in some sense mental,  as concerned rather with the way we must think than with any fact of  the outer world. We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles  commonly called 'laws of thought'. The view which led to their being so  named is a natural one, but there are strong reasons for thinking  that it is erroneous. Let us take as an illustration the law of  contradiction. This is commonly stated in the form 'Nothing can both be  and not be', which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at  once have and not have a given quality. Thus, for example, if a tree  is a beech it cannot also be not a beech; if my table is rectangular it  cannot also be not rectangular, and so on.    Now what makes it natural to call this principle a law of _thought_  is that it is by thought rather than by outward observation that we  persuade ourselves of its necessary truth. When we have seen that a tree  is a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether  it is also not a beech; thought alone makes us know that this is  impossible. But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law  of _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous. What we believe, when we believe  the law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must  believe the law of contradiction. _This_ belief is a subsequent result  of psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of  contradiction. The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about  things, not only about thoughts. It is not, e.g., the belief that if we  _think_ a certain tree is a beech, we cannot at the same time _think_  that it is not a beech; it is the belief that if the tree _is_ a  beech, it cannot at the same time _be_ not a beech. Thus the law of  contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts; and  although belief in the law of contradiction is a thought, the law of  contradiction itself is not a thought, but a fact concerning the things  in the world. If this, which we believe when we believe the law of  contradiction, were not true of the things in the world, the fact  that we were compelled to _think_ it true would not save the law of  contradiction from being false; and this shows that the law is not a law  of _thought_.    A similar argument applies to any other _a priori_ judgement. When we  judge that two and two are four, we are not making a judgement about our  thoughts, but about all actual or possible couples. The fact that our  minds are so constituted as to believe that two and two are four, though  it is true, is emphatically not what we assert when we assert that two  and two are four. And no fact about the constitution of our minds could  make it _true_ that two and two are four. Thus our _a priori_ knowledge,  if it is not erroneous, is not merely knowledge about the constitution  of our minds, but is applicable to whatever the world may contain, both  what is mental and what is non-mental.    The fact seems to be that all our _a priori_ knowledge is concerned with  entities which do not, properly speaking, _exist_, either in the mental  or in the physical world. These entities are such as can be named by  parts of speech which are not substantives; they are such entities as  qualities and relations. Suppose, for instance, that I am in my room. I  exist, and my room exists; but does 'in' exist? Yet obviously the word  'in' has a meaning; it denotes a relation which holds between me and my  room. This relation is something, although we cannot say that it exists  _in the same sense_ in which I and my room exist. The relation 'in' is  something which we can think about and understand, for, if we could not  understand it, we could not understand the sentence 'I am in my room'.  Many philosophers, following Kant, have maintained that relations are  the work of the mind, that things in themselves have no relations,  but that the mind brings them together in one act of thought and thus  produces the relations which it judges them to have.    This view, however, seems open to objections similar to those which we  urged before against Kant. It seems plain that it is not thought which  produces the truth of the proposition 'I am in my room'. It may be true  that an earwig is in my room, even if neither I nor the earwig nor any  one else is aware of this truth; for this truth concerns only the earwig  and the room, and does not depend upon anything else. Thus relations, as  we shall see more fully in the next chapter, must be placed in a world  which is neither mental nor physical. This world is of great importance  to philosophy, and in particular to the problems of _a priori_  knowledge. In the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature  and its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing.        CHAPTER IX. THE WORLD OF UNIVERSALS    At the end of the preceding chapter we saw that such entities as  relations appear to have a being which is in some way different from  that of physical objects, and also different from that of minds and from  that of sense-data. In the present chapter we have to consider what is  the nature of this kind of being, and also what objects there are that  have this kind of being. We will begin with the latter question.    The problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one, since it  was brought into philosophy by Plato. Plato's 'theory of ideas' is an  attempt to solve this very problem, and in my opinion it is one of the  most successful attempts hitherto made. The theory to be advocated in  what follows is largely Plato's, with merely such modifications as time  has shown to be necessary.    The way the problem arose for Plato was more or less as follows. Let  us consider, say, such a notion as _justice_. If we ask ourselves what  justice is, it is natural to proceed by considering this, that, and the  other just act, with a view to discovering what they have in common.  They must all, in some sense, partake of a common nature, which will be  found in whatever is just and in nothing else. This common nature, in  virtue of which they are all just, will be justice itself, the pure  essence the admixture of which with facts of ordinary life produces the  multiplicity of just acts. Similarly with any other word which may be  applicable to common facts, such as 'whiteness' for example. The word  will be applicable to a number of particular things because they all  participate in a common nature or essence. This pure essence is what  Plato calls an 'idea' or 'form'. (It must not be supposed that 'ideas',  in his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.)  The 'idea' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just: it is  something other than particular things, which particular things partake  of. Not being particular, it cannot itself exist in the world of sense.  Moreover it is not fleeting or changeable like the things of sense: it  is eternally itself, immutable and indestructible.    Thus Plato is led to a supra-sensible world, more real than the common  world of sense, the unchangeable world of ideas, which alone gives to  the world of sense whatever pale reflection of reality may belong to it.  The truly real world, for Plato, is the world of ideas; for whatever  we may attempt to say about things in the world of sense, we can only  succeed in saying that they participate in such and such ideas, which,  therefore, constitute all their character. Hence it is easy to pass  on into a mysticism. We may hope, in a mystic illumination, to see the  ideas as we see objects of sense; and we may imagine that the ideas  exist in heaven. These mystical developments are very natural, but the  basis of the theory is in logic, and it is as based in logic that we  have to consider it.    The word 'idea' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations  which are quite misleading when applied to Plato's 'ideas'. We shall  therefore use the word 'universal' instead of the word 'idea', to  describe what Plato meant. The essence of the sort of entity that Plato  meant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in  sensation."]]]
