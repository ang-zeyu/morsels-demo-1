She can, and no doubt      will, fully clear away any sophistry and falsehood of Mr. Evans'      statement of the alleged interview.        Referring to the interview with President Snow, Mr. Evans says:      \"Lorenzo Snow did testify to me as stated. But then and there, in      the presence of Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, I showed      his testimony to be false by his own evidence when given under      oath, and his sister's statement signed in 1842. At this, Snow,      Cannon and Smith were much annoyed. So much for your father's      statement, which says 'you did not say one word to him in relation      to polygamy.'\" The fact is, President Snow gave Mr. Evans, in my      presence and hearing, a plain, simple narration of the instructions      he received from Joseph Smith in regard to the doctrine of plural      marriage, including almost word for word the statement he had      previously made under oath, and testified that Joseph informed      him that his sister Eliza R. Snow had been sealed to him as his      wife. This much and more in this line I distinctly heard and as      distinctly remember, but I did not hear the alleged arraignment      of President Snow's testimony by Mr. Evans, nor did I witness or      experience any \"annoyance\" on the part of myself or anyone present      because of the said arraignment. Indeed, I am prepared to affirm      that Mr. Evans did not \"then and there\" in my presence and that of      Geo. Q. Cannon, nor in the presence of any one there, \"show his      (Snow's) testimony to be false,\" either \"by his own evidence when      given under oath,\" or \"by his sister's statement signed in 1842,\"      or at any other time.        I am here constrained to say that Mr. Evans was treated by      President Snow, as also by President George Q. Cannon and      myself, in the most courteous and respectful manner, and so      far as I observed his demeanor towards us was reciprocal and      gentlemanly--and not one word was said to him by anyone nor by      him to anyone in my presence that was in any degree discourteous,      contentious or embarrassing.        I conclude, therefore, that the foregoing statements made by      Mr. Evans, were after thoughts uttered by him with a view to      misrepresent the truth and the facts, on the lines of the bitter      and relentless opposition of himself and associates to the Church      of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in general, and the doctrine      of plural marriage in particular, as revealed, taught and practiced      by Joseph Smith himself, from whom Brigham Young and many others      received it. On these matters they are so surcharged with animus      that they will not receive, admit, or tell the truth.        With reference to Mr. Evans' allusion to my first wife I will      simply say: She was most intimately acquainted from her childhood      with the young lady who became my second wife, and it was with      their full knowledge and consent that I entered into plural      marriage, my first wife being present as a witness when I took my      second wife, and freely gave her consent thereto. Our associations      as a family were pleasant and harmonious.        It was not until long after the second marriage that my first wife      was drawn away from us, not on account of domestic troubles, but      for other causes which I do not care to mention. In eight years of      wedded life we had no children. She constantly complained of ill      health and was as constantly under a doctor's care. She concluded      to go to California for her health and before going procured a      separation. This all occurred previous to 1867. On March 1, 1868      I married Sarah E. Richards, and January 1, 1870, I married Edna      Lambson, from one to three years after my first wife separated      from me, and had become a resident of California. She subsequently      returned to Utah and later went to St. Louis where she died.    Your self-exaltation in classing yourself with Jacob is most  stupendous, to say the least. He was above accepting idle rumors, from  such sources as those given by the writer of the article of _Collier's_  which you quote, and which are false. Jacob was no aspersor.    Aunt Catherine Phillips Smith also declares that she did testify to you  in regard to her marriage and that you questioned her quite closely.  My mother declares the same for she was present at the conversation.  Presidents Snow and Cannon are not here to speak in their defense, but  I am satisfied that they would bear witness to the foregoing letter.  Aunt Lucy may testify for herself.      TESTIMONY OF LUCY W. SMITH    The day I received a copy of the _Ensign_ containing your discourse  from which you give extracts in your \"reply,\" in relation to your  \"conversation\" with Aunt Lucy W. Smith, I sent her a copy of your  remarks with the request that she tell me if you had correctly reported  her testimony. In the course of a few days I received this:        My Dear Boy: I very much regret not feeling able to answer your      request at an earlier date. I am, however, much improved in health      since coming to Logan, and take pleasure in declaring to you that      the infamous discourse delivered 16th Feb. 1905 (the date of the      _Ensign_) at St. Louis, Missouri, by Mr. Evans, is a fabrication of      falsehoods and misrepresentations. I confess that I was not only      surprised, but shocked beyond measure. Now one of the presidency      of the Reorganized church, just think of it! And at the time he      came to Salt Lake City three years ago, he claimed to be one of      \"young Joseph's apostles; came with a letter of introduction from      cousin Joseph to his cousin Joseph F., saying that any courtesy      shown him would be appreciated. Accordingly, Mr. Evans was shown      every consideration. He accepted the generous hospitality of our      President and his model family. Having expressed a desire to meet      Mrs. Lucy W. Kimball, who was engaged that afternoon, arrangements      were made to meet at the theatre, as he had to leave next day.      He asked me many questions which I answered frankly--some very      offensive hearsay questions that aroused my indignation, but I      bore the ordeal as a martyr should. And from this opportunity      sprang the wonderful discourse of wicked falsehood and malicious      misrepresentation. O, shame! Where canst thou hide thy brazen face!      How dare he resort to such infamy unless to satiate a morbid desire      for notoriety among sensation-mongers, who seek not for light or      truth! If so he only gratified the cravings of the basest and      lowest caste.        I cannot believe that the once highly and beloved Emma who was so      loyal and true to her husband in all the early trials and hardships      to which he was subject, when in chains and bondage, when he was      dragged from his bed, tarred and feathered, imprisoned and mocked      and scoffed at, ridiculed and abused, and his life threatened by      infuriated mobs and she stood by him and comforted him in all of      his afflictions--I cannot believe after enduring all this for      his sake, that Emma Smith ever denied seeing the revelation on      celestial marriage after receiving it in good faith and accepting      it as a command from God, _knowing_ as I do, that she taught it      to Eliza and Emily Partridge, Maria and Sarah Lawrence, and urged      them to accept it by being sealed to her husband. She treated them      kindly and considerately and knew they were associated with him as      his wives. She was then a happy woman, until the tempter came in      human form, and she partook of the apostate spirit so rife in those      days. She could not deny these facts without sinning against her      husband, sinning against his wives, against the truth, and against      her God!        If her son insists that this denial was her last testimony he      fastens a stigma on her once noble character in the estimation of      her former friends and associates, who were familiar with the facts      of the period referred to. This misguided son, young and without      experience, was surrounded by his father's most wicked enemies who      had betrayed his father, and had been instrumental in taking his      life; and who, after they had accomplished this foul act, through      sinister policies, determined to destroy the work his father was      commanded to do, and had laid a permanent foundation on which to      build up his church--the Church of Christ. They sought to influence      his son against the teachings of his father, call him forth as a      \"leader\" with promises of success, and good backing. Poor boy was      flattered and led on and on, by crafty men, until he became an      unbeliever of the principles his father had taught; and I cannot      but believe that through such influences his mother has been      misrepresented. I am unwilling to believe otherwise.        I expressed regrets to Mr. Evans in relation to the course taken      by \"young Joseph\" through the influence of the bitter opponents of      his father. I said he had closed his eyes to anything that would      cast a ray of light on the vexed question: \"Did my father have      more [other] wives than my mother?\" I answered truthfully without      hesitation. Afterwards he went to Lehi, called on Melissa Lott,      with whom he had been associated from early childhood and asked:      \"Will you answer me one question, I come to you knowing you will      tell me the truth, were you my father's wife?\" \"Yes, Joseph, I      was.\" \"Where is your proof?\" She stepped to the stand and took the      family Bible opened to the family record, placed it on his knee and      asked: \"Do you recognize the handwriting?\" \"Certainly that is your      father's (Cornelius P. Lott's) handwriting, know it as well as my      own.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#14)"],[1," until finally some of the sects repudiated it, while  others, retaining the \"form of godliness,\" denied \"the power thereof.\"    So much stress having been laid upon immersion, as the proper mode of  baptism, one might be led to inquire, Why are we not immersed in the  Spirit, as well as in the water? I answer: How know you that we are  not? To which the reply may be: We see the water, and are put under it  by the priest: but when we are confirmed or baptized with the Spirit,  the elders lay their hands upon our heads and say, \"Receive ye the Holy  Ghost.\" There is no immersion about that; we are not dipped or plunged:  the Spirit is poured upon us.    Be not too sure that there is no immersion about it. The fact that you  do not see it is no conclusive argument against the proposition. We see  the water because it is a temporal element: but spiritual things are  discerned by the Spirit. As to the pouring process--may not enough of  an element be poured upon a person to bury him therein? Or must that in  which a person is buried necessarily come from beneath? It was not so  in the days of Noah, when it rained forty days and forty nights that  the earth might be buried in water. As much water came from above as  from beneath at that time.    John the Baptist, when proclaiming the Christ, said: \"There cometh One  mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy  to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have baptized you with water; but  he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost\" (Mark 1:7,8). More than one  baptism is here mentioned, but it is baptism in each case; and baptism  signifies immersion. The candidate for baptism cannot well be dipped  or plunged in the Spirit, since the Spirit is above, while the water  is beneath; but he may be covered by or \"clothed upon\" with the Holy  Ghost, nevertheless. The essential point in baptism is not the dipping  or plunging, but the burying and bringing forth.    Baptism, a Symbol of Creation.--Baptism symbolizes creation. Earth,  created for Adam and his seed, was baptized--\"born again\"--for Noah  and his posterity. Baptized with water in that day, it will yet be  baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire. The laying on of hands and  the descent of the Spirit from above, may possibly typify the glorious  baptism that earth will yet undergo, when the Spirit is poured out  upon her from on high, and she is covered therewith as completely as  with water in the days of Noah. \"I will pour out my Spirit upon all  flesh,\" said the Lord by the Prophet Joel (2:28). When that prophecy is  fulfilled, earth will receive her spirit baptism, and in due time be  ready for her baptism of fire.    Fire and the Holy Ghost.--God \"dwells in eternal fire\" (\"Joseph Smith's  Teachings,\" p. 82), where no mortal could approach him unconsumed.  But mortals may receive the Holy Ghost with safety. Again: the  inhabitants of the telestial world receive the Holy Spirit through the  ministrations of the terrestrial; \"but where God and Christ dwell they  cannot come, worlds without end.\" By her fiery baptism, earth will be  consumed; her mortal elements will melt with fervent heat, and the  purified remains, immortal and in a state of resurrection, will be  converted into a celestial sphere, a glorified abode for the righteous.    Baptism Symbolizes Birth.--Every resurrection is a birth, and every  birth implies a previous burial. No seed germinates till it dies, or  appears to die, and is buried. The farmer plants that there may be a  springing forth of new life from the germ of the old. Every seed sown  in the likeness of Christ's death shall be in the likeness of his  resurrection; that is, if it be a good seed, properly buried in good  ground.    Every birth, I say, implies a previous burial. This is true of time in  its relations to eternity. Coming into this life involves departure  out of a previous life, and burial in this life implies birth into  the next. The sun, setting upon the western hemisphere, rises upon  the eastern; and sets upon the eastern to rise upon the western. The  setting and rising of the sun; sleep followed by waking; winter with  its icy fetters and shroud of snow, succeeded by spring in garments of  green, with its bright flowers, singing birds, and laughing streams;  all these suggest burial, and resurrection--and consequently baptism.    Born of God.--To be \"born of God\" literally means to come forth from  God. \"Born of woman\" has a like significance. We have a Father and a  Mother in heaven, in whose image man was created, male and female. We  came forth from them--were begotten and born of them in the spirit,  as much so as we were afterwards begotten and born in the flesh; and  we must be begotten and born again, in the similitude of those other  begettings and births, or we cannot regain the presence of our eternal  Father and Mother.    \"Children of My Begetting.\"--Baptism signifies the creation of souls  for the kingdom of God. The priest who immerses, or the elder who  confirms, is the spiritual progenitor of the person baptized. \"Children  of my begetting,\" Paul terms those receiving the gospel through his  instrumentality. To baptize is to perform, in a spiritual way, the  functions of fatherhood. Motherhood is the sacred symbol of the  baptismal font. Hence, baptism must be by divine authority--must have  the sanction of heaven upon it. There must first be a marriage, a union  between heavenly powers and earthly agents; otherwise the baptism will  be unlawful, the birth illegitimate, the act of begetting a crime!  Baptisms, like marriages, performed without divine authority, will have  no effect when men are dead.    Suggestive Symbolism.--The significance of baptism is suggested by the  very career of that Divine Being whose descent from heaven to earth,  and whose ascent from earth into heaven, is the sum and substance of  the Gospel story. His experience from the time he left his celestial  throne, to the time he returned thither, was it not a descending below,  and a rising above, all things? Did he not lay down his life and take  it up again, as the Father had done before him? Is it not just possible  that baptism was instituted to symbolize this mighty birth, this mortal  burial, with its immortal resurrection?    When the Gods sat in council to consider the creation and redemption  of this planet, what was their great thought and the theme of their  deliberations? Was it not a going down and a coming back--not only  on their part, for creative and redemptive purposes, but also on the  part of their offspring, for purposes of experience and progression?  What wonder, then, if in the gospel plan, whereby the spirits of men  and women might accomplish this foreordained descent into, and ascent  out of, the world, there should be an ordinance symbolical of the vast  vicissitude?    Moreover, in the symbolism of the scriptures this world is represented  by water. \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,  and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the  face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the  waters.\" Here, at the very dawn of creation, are the two principles  or elements--spirit and water--with which baptisms are performed--one  creative, the other creatable; one representing heaven, the other,  earth. Note the reference in Daniel (7) to beasts, representing earthly  governments, coming up from the sea. Note the Savior's parable,  likening the kingdom of heaven to a net cast into the sea; the sea  symbolizing the world, the fishes, the souls drawn out of the world.  Note also Revelation (13) where a beast representing anti-Christ,  rises out of the sea: and (17) where a woman, the Mother of Harlots,  representing a great city reigning over the kings of the earth, is  described as \"sitting upon many waters\"--the waters signifying \"peoples  and multitudes and nations and tongues.\"    Much of the body of this world--the physical frame of a spiritual  creation--is water, even parts of it that seem solid. Science so  affirms, and who can gainsay it? Walt Whitman, that eccentric poetic  genius, speaks of \"the slumbering and liquid trees.\" Thales, the  founder of Greek philosophy, started out with the proposition: \"All  things are water.\" He ascribed to water the powers of creation,  supposing that he had found in it the primal element, or great first  cause. He omitted the real creative principle--the Spirit of God,  which in the beginning \"moved upon the face of the waters,\" or as  Milton says, \"dove-like sat brooding on the vast abyss.\" Thales being a  physicist, took no account of the spiritual. Geology asserts that the  earth was once submerged in water. The scriptures also declare it, and  without reference to the deluge. \"Let the dry land appear!\"--the very  words suggest baptism, birth, creation--the emergence of a primitive  planet from the womb of the waters. Water, symbolically if not  literally, represents the temporal part of creation, including the body  or mortal part of man.    Is not baptism, therefore, in its two-fold character and significance,  suggestive of the soul's passing out from this watery world, into the  spirit world, and thence, by resurrection, into eternal glory? It is  only a suggestion, but it seems to emphasize, for me, the reason why  the doorway to the Church and Kingdom of God is a double doorway, a  dual birth, a baptism of Water and of the Spirit?        Priesthood and Church Government.    CHAPTER I.    Divine Authority.    \"Priest\" Defined.--The English word \"Priest\" is generally derived from  the New Testament term \"presbyter\" (Elder), which means \"to preside.\"  Aristotle's definition of \"Priest\" is, \"presiding over things relating  to the gods.\" Similar to this is Paul's understanding of the term,  as expressed in Heb. 5:1: \"Every high priest taken from among men  is constituted on the behalf of men, with respect to their concerns  with God, "]]]
