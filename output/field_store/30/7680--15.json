It's not the    game.  When one of the Human Family proposes to eat a    sausage-roll, it is his duty to ask himself, \"Am I a    conspirator?\"  And if, on examination, he finds that he is not a    conspirator, he is bound in honour to select some other form of    refreshment.          LISA.  Of course he is.  One should always play the game.    (To NOTARY, who has been smiling placidly through this.)  What    are you grinning at, you greedy old man?          NOT.  Nothingdon't mind me.  It is always amusing to the    legal mind to see a parcel of laymen bothering themselves about a    matter which to a trained lawyer presents no difficulty whatever.          ALL.  No difficulty!          NOT.  None whatever!  The way out of it is quite simple.          ALL.  Simple?          NOT.  Certainly!  Now attend.  In the first place, you two    men fight a Statutory Duel.          ERN.  A Statutory Duel?          JULIA.  A Stat-tat-tatutory Duel!  Ach! what a crack-jaw    language this German is!          LUD.  Never heard of such a thing.          NOT.  It is true that the practice has fallen into abeyance    through disuse.  But all the laws of Pfennig Halbpfennig run for    a hundred years, when they die a natural death, unless, in the    meantime, they have been revived for another century.  The Act    that institutes the Statutory Duel was passed a hundred years    ago, and as it has never been revived, it expires to-morrow.  So    you're just in time.          JULIA.  But what is the use of talking to us about    Statutory    Duels when we none of us know what a Statutory Duel is?          NOT.  Don't you?  Then I'll explain.                              SONGNOTARY.                  About a century since,                      The code of the duello                            To sudden death                            For want of breath                      Sent many a strapping fellow.                The then presiding Prince                      (Who useless bloodshed hated),                            He passed an Act,                            Short and compact,                      Which may be briefly stated.                Unlike the complicated laws                A Parliamentary draftsman draws,                      It may be briefly stated.      ALL.        We know that complicated laws,                Such as a legal draftsman draws,                      Cannot be briefly stated.      NOT.        By this ingenious law,                      If any two shall quarrel,                            They may not fight                            With falchions bright                      (Which seemed to him immoral);                But each a card shall draw,                      And he who draws the lowest                            Shall (so 'twas said)                            Be thenceforth dead                      In fact, a legal \"ghoest\"                (When exigence of rhyme compels,                Orthography forgoes her spells,                      And \"ghost\" is written \"ghoest\").      ALL (aside)       With what an emphasis he dwells                Upon \"orthography\" and \"spells\"!                      That kind of fun's the lowest.      NOT.        When off the loser's popped                      (By pleasing legal fiction),                            And friend and foe                            Have wept their woe                      In counterfeit affliction,                The winner must adopt                      The loser's poor relations                            Discharge his debts,                            Pay all his bets,                      And take his obligations.                  In short, to briefly sum the case,                The winner takes the loser's place,                      With all its obligations.      ALL.        How neatly lawyers state a case!                The winner takes the loser's place,                      With all its obligations!            LUD.  I see.  The man who draws the lowest card          NOT.  Dies, ipso facto, a social death.  He loses all his    civil rightshis identity disappearsthe Revising Barrister    expunges his name from the list of voters, and the winner takes    his place, whatever it may be, discharges all his functions, and    adopts all his responsibilities.          ERN.  This is all very well, as far as it goes, but it only    protects one of us.  What's to become of the survivor?          LUD.  Yes, that's an interesting point, because I might be    the survivor.          NOT.  The survivor goes at once to the Grand Duke, and, in    a    burst of remorse, denounces the dead man as the moving spirit of    the plot.  He is accepted as King's evidence, and, as a matter of    course, receives a free pardon.  To-morrow, when the law expires,    the dead man will, ipso facto, come to life againthe Revising    Barrister will restore his name to the list of voters, and he    will resume all his obligations as though nothing unusual had    happened.          JULIA.  When he will be at once arrested, tried, and    executed on the evidence of the informer!  Candidly, my friend, I    don't think much of your plot!          NOT.  Dear, dear, dear, the ignorance of the laity!  My    good    young lady, it is a beautiful maxim of our glorious Constitution    that a man can only die once.  Death expunges crime, and when he    comes to life again, it will be with a clean slate.          ERN.  It's really very ingenious.          LUD. (to NOTARY).  My dear sir, we owe you our lives!          LISA (aside to LUDWIG).  May I kiss him?          LUD.  Certainly not: you're a big girl now.  (To ERNEST.)    Well, miscreant, are you prepared to meet me on the field of    honour?          ERN.  At once.  By Jove, what a couple of fire-eaters we    are!          LISA.  Ludwig doesn't know what fear is.          LUD.  Oh, I don't mind this sort of duel!          ERN.  It's not like a duel with swords.  I hate a duel with    swords.  It's not the blade I mindit's the blood.          LUD.  And I hate a duel with pistols.  It's not the ball I    mindit's the bang.          NOT.  Altogether it is a great improvement on the old    method    of giving satisfaction.                                 QUINTET.                  LUDWIG, LISA, NOTARY, ERNEST, JULIA.            Strange the views some people hold!                Two young fellows quarrel          Then they fight, for both are bold          Rage of both is uncontrolled          Both are stretched out, stark and cold!                Prithee, where's the moral?                      Ding dong!  Ding dong!          There's an end to further action,          And this barbarous transaction          Is described as \"satisfaction\"!                Ha! ha! ha! ha! satisfaction!                      Ding dong! Ding dong!          Each is laid in churchyard mould          Strange the views some people hold!            Better than the method old,                Which was coarse and cruel,          Is the plan that we've extolled.          Sing thy virtues manifold          (Better than refined gold),                Statutory Duel!                      Sing song! Sing song!            Sword or pistol neither uses          Playing card he lightly chooses,          And the loser simply loses!                Ha! ha! ha! ha! simply loses.                      Sing song! Sing song!          Some prefer the churchyard mould!          Strange the views some people hold!      NOT. (offering a card to ERNEST).                Now take a card and gaily sing          How little you care for Fortune's rubs      ERN. (drawing a card).          Hurrah, hurrah!I've drawn a King:      ALL.              He's drawn a King!                      He's drawn a King!          Sing Hearts and Diamonds, Spades and Clubs!      ALL (dancing).    He's drawn a King!                      How strange a thing!          An excellent cardhis chance it aids          Sing Hearts and Diamonds, Spades and Clubs          Sing Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs and Spades!      NOT. (to LUDWIG).                Now take a card with heart of grace          (Whatever our fate, let's play our parts).      LUD.  (drawing card).          Hurrah, hurrah!I've drawn an Ace!      ALL.              He's drawn an Ace!                      He's drawn an Ace!          Sing Clubs and Diamonds, Spades and Hearts!      ALL (dancing).                      He's drawn an Ace!                      Observe his face          Such very good fortune falls to few          Sing Clubs and Diamonds, Spades and Hearts          Sing Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds too!      NOT.  That both these maids may keep their troth,                And never misfortune them befall,          I'll hold 'em as trustee for both      ALL.              He'll hold 'em both!                      He'll hold 'em both!          Sing Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades and all!      ALL (dancing).    By joint decree                      As {our/your} trustee          This Notary {we/you} will now instal          In custody let him keep {their/our} hearts,          Sing Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades and all!      [Dance and exeunt LUDWIG, ERNEST, and    NOTARY with the two Girls.      March. Enter the seven Chamberlains of the    GRAND DUKE RUDOLPH.                        CHORUS OF CHAMBERLAINS.
