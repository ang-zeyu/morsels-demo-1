In the spring, when the  rivers broke up and the melting snows began to pour in torrents down  every ravine and gully, the three young men paddled down the Sangamon  in a canoe to the point where Jamestown now stands; whence they walked  five miles to Springfield, where Offutt had given them rendezvous.  They met him at Elliott's tavern and far from happy. Amid the  multiplicity of his engagements he had failed to procure a flat-boat,  and the first work his new hands must do was to build one. They cut  the timber, with frontier innocence, from \"Congress land,\" and soon  had a serviceable craft afloat, with which they descended the current  of the Sangamon to New Salem, a little village which seems to have  been born for the occasion, as it came into existence just before the  arrival of Lincoln, nourished for seven years while he remained one of  its citizens, and died soon after he went away. His introduction to  his fellow-citizens was effected in a peculiar and somewhat striking  manner. Offutt's boat had come to serious embarrassment on Rutledge's  mill-dam, and the unwonted incident brought the entire population to  the water's edge. They spent a good part of the day watching the  hapless flat-boat, resting midships on the dam, the forward end in the  air and the stern taking in the turbid Sangamon water. Nobody knew  what to do with the disaster except \"the bow-oar,\" who is described as  a gigantic youth \"with his trousers rolled up some five feet,\" who was  wading about the boat and rigging up some undescribed contrivance by  which the cargo was unloaded, the boat tilted and the water let out by  boring a hole through the bottom, and everything brought safely to  moorings below the dam. This exploit gained for young Lincoln the  enthusiastic admiration of his employer, and turned his own mind in  the direction of an invention which he afterwards patented \"for  lifting vessels over shoals.\" The model on which he obtained this  patent--a little boat whittled by his own hand in 1849, after he had  become prominent as a lawyer and politician--is still shown to  visitors at the Department of the Interior. We have never learned that  it has served any other purpose.    [Illustration:   MODEL OF LINCOLN'S INVENTION, IN THE PATENT OFFICE,  WASHINGTON.]    [Illustration:   REDUCED FAC-SIMILE OF DRAWINGS IN THE PATENT OFFICE.]    [Sidenote: Lamon, p. 83.]    They made a quick trip down the Sangamon, the Illinois, and the  Mississippi rivers. Although it was but a repetition in great part of  the trip young Lincoln had made with Gentry, it evidently created a  far deeper impression on his mind than the former one. The simple and  honest words of John Hanks leave no doubt of this. At New Orleans, he  said, they saw for the first time \"negroes chained, maltreated,  whipped, and scourged. Lincoln saw it; his heart bled; said nothing  much, was silent, looked bad. I can say, knowing it, that it was on  this trip that he formed his opinion of slavery. It run its iron in  him then and there, May, 1831. I have heard him say so often.\" The  sight of men in chains was intolerable to him. Ten years after this he  made another journey by water with his friend Joshua Speed, of  Kentucky. Writing to Speed about it after the lapse of fourteen years,  he says: \"In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip on a  steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well  do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were on board  ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons. That sight was a  continual torment to me, and I see something like it every time I  touch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not fair for you to  assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually  exercises, the power of making me miserable.\"    There have been several ingenious attempts to show the origin and  occasion of Mr. Lincoln's antislavery convictions. They seem to us an  idle waste of labor. These sentiments came with the first awakening of  his mind and conscience, and were roused into active life and energy  by the sight of fellow-creatures in chains on an Ohio River steamboat,  and on the wharf at New Orleans.    The party went up the river in the early summer and separated in St.  Louis. Abraham walked in company with John Johnston from St. Louis to  Coles County, and spent a few weeks there with his father, who had  made another migration the year before. His final move was to Goose  Nest Prairie, where he died in 1851, [Footnote: His grave, a mile and  a half west of the town of Farmington, Illinois, is surmounted by an  appropriate monument erected by his grandson, the Hon. Robert T.  Lincoln.] at the age of seventy-three years, after a life which,  though not successful in any material or worldly point of view, was  probably far happier than that of his illustrious son, being unvexed  by enterprise or ambition. Abraham never lost sight of his parents. He  continued to aid and befriend them in every way, even when he could  ill afford it, and when his benefactions were imprudently used. He not  only comforted their declining years with every aid his affection  could suggest, but he did everything in his power to assist his  stepbrother Johnston--a hopeless task enough. The following rigidly  truthful and yet kindly letters will show how mentor-like and  masterful, as well as generous, were the relations that Mr. Lincoln  held to these friends and companions of his childhood:    DEAR JOHNSTON: Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best  to comply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a  little, you have said to me, \"We can get along very well now,\" but in  a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now this  can only happen by some defect in your conduct.    What that defect is I think I know. You are not _lazy_, and still  you are an _idler_. I doubt whether, since I saw you, you have  done a good whole day's work in any one day. You do not very much  dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it  does not seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of  uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty, and it is vastly  important to you, and still more so to your children, that you should  break the habit. It is more important to them because they have longer  to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it  easier than they can get out after they are in.    You are now in need of some money; and what I propose is that you  shall go to work \"tooth and nail\" for somebody who will give you money  for it. Let father and your boys take charge of things at home,  prepare for a crop, and make the crop; and you go to work for the best  money wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get;  and to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that  for every dollar you will, between this and the first of next May, get  for your own labor, either in money or as discharging your own  indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you  hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more,  making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this I do not mean you  should go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines in  California; but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can  get close to home, in Coles County. Now, if you will do this you will  soon be out of debt, and, what is better, you will have a habit that  will keep you from getting in debt again. But if I should now clear  you out of debt, next year you would be just as deep in as ever. You  say you would almost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty  dollars. Then you value your place in heaven very cheap, for I am sure  you can with the offer I make get the seventy or eighty dollars for  four or five months' work. You say if I will furnish you the money you  will deed me the land, and if you don't pay the money back you will  deliver possession. Nonsense. If you can't now live with the land, how  will you then live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I  do not mean to be unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but  follow my advice, you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty  dollars to you.    Here is a later epistle, still more graphic and terse in statement,  which has the unusual merit of painting both confessor and penitent to  the life:      SHELBYVILLE, Nov. 4, 1851.    DEAR BROTHER: When I came into Charleston, day before yesterday, I  learned that you were anxious to sell the land where you live and move  to Missouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but  think such a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri  better than here? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than  here, raise corn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there,  any more than here, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work,  there is no better place than right where you are; if you do not  intend to go to work, you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and  crawling about from place to place can do no good. You have raised no  crop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land, get the  money, and spend it. Part with the land you have, and, my life upon  it, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in. Half  you will get for the land you will spend in moving to Missouri, and  the other half you will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of  land will be bought. Now, I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such  a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so even on your own account, and  particularly on mother's account. The eastern forty acres I intend to  keep for mother while she lives; if you will not cultivate it, it will  rent for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#14)"],[1,"'30's. It is not to be supposed that the  population fluctuated so enormously from one year to another, but  rather that the facilities for export were irregular.    The case is further complicated by the fact that some of the totals  represent part of this year and part of last; nevertheless, upon  the whole, the following general principles are deducible:    (a) The high points for each species are with fair regularity 10  years apart.    (b) In the different species these are not exactly coincident.    (c) To explain the variations we must seek not the reason for the  increase--that is normal--but for the destructive agency that ended  the increase.    This is different in three different groups.    First. The group whose food and enemies fluctuate but little. The  only examples of this on our list are the Muskrat and Beaver, more  especially the Muskrat. Its destruction seems to be due to a sudden  great rise of the water after the ice has formed, so that the Rats  are drowned; or to a dry season followed by severe frost, freezing  most ponds to the bottom, so that the Rats are imprisoned and starve  to death, or are forced out to cross the country in winter, and so  are brought within the power of innumerable enemies.    How tremendously this operates may be judged by these facts. In  1900 along the Mackenzie I was assured one could shoot 20 Muskrats  in an hour after sundown. Next winter the flood followed the  frost and the Rats seemed to have been wiped out. In 1907 1 spent  6 months outdoors in the region and saw only 17 Muskrats the whole  time; in 1901 the H. B. Co. exported over 11 millions; in 1907,  407,472. The fact that they totalled as high was due, no doubt, to  their abundance in eastern regions not affected by the disaster.    Second. The group that increases till epidemic disease attacks  their excessively multiplied hordes. The Snowshoe-Rabbit is the  only well-known case today, but there is reason for the belief that  once the Beaver were subjected to a similar process. Concerning the  Mice and Lemmings, I have not complete data, but they are believed  to multiply and suffer in the same, way.    Third. The purely carnivorous, whose existence is dependent on the  Rabbits. This includes chiefly the Lynx and Fox, but in less degree  all the small carnivores.    In some cases such as the Marten, over-feeding seems as inimical  to multiplication as under-feeding, and it will be seen that each  year of great increase for this species coincided with a medium  year for Rabbits.    But the fundamental and phenomenal case is that of the Rabbits  themselves. And in solving this we are confronted by the generally  attested facts that when on the increase they have two or three  broods each season and 8 to 10 in a brood; when they are decreasing  they have but one brood and only 2 or 3 in that. This points to some  obscure agency at work; whether it refers simply to the physical  vigour of the fact, or to some uncomprehended magnetic or heliological  cycle, is utterly unknown.    The practical consideration for the collecting naturalist is this:  Beaver, Muskrat, Otter, Fisher, Raccoon, Badger, Wolverine, Wolf,  Marten, Fox reached the low ebb in 1904-5. All are on the upgrade;  presumably the same applies to the small rodents. Their decacycle  will be complete in 1914-15, so that 1910-11 should be the years  selected by the next collecting naturalist who would visit the  north.    For those who will enter before that there is a reasonable prospect  of all these species in fair numbers, except perhaps the Lynx and  the Caribou. Evidently the former must be near minimum now (1909)  and the latter would be scarce, if it is subject to the rule of the  decacycle, though it is not at all proven that such is the case.          CHAPTER XVI    THE PELICAN TRIP        We were still held back by the dilatory ways of our Indian friends,  so to lose no time Preble and I determined to investigate a Pelican  rookery.    Most persons associate the name Pelican with tropic lands and  fish, but ornithologists have long known that in the interior of  the continent the great white Pelican ranges nearly or quite to  the Arctic circle. The northmost colony on record was found on an  island of Great Slave Lake (see Preble, \"N.A. Fauna,\" 27), but this  is a very small one. The northmost large colony, and the one made  famous by travellers from Alexander Mackenzie downward, is on the  great island that splits the Smith Rapids above Fort Smith. Here,  with a raging flood about their rocky citadel, they are safe from  all spoilers that travel on the earth; only a few birds of the air  need they fear, and these they have strength to repel.    On June 22 we set out to explore this. Preble, Billy, and myself,  with our canoe on a wagon, drove 6 miles back on the landing trail  and launched the canoe on the still water above Mountain Portage.  Pelican Island must be approached exactly right, in the comparatively  slow water above the rocky island, for 20 feet away on each side  is an irresistible current leading into a sure-death cataract. But  Billy was a river pilot and we made the point in safety.    Drifted like snow through the distant woods were the brooding birds,  but they arose before we were near and sailed splendidly overhead  in a sweeping, wide-fronted rank. As nearly as I could number them,  there were 120, but evidently some were elsewhere, as this would  not allow a pair to each nest.    We landed safely and found the nests scattered among the trees and  fallen timbers. One or two mother birds ran off on foot, but took  wing as soon as clear of the woods--none remained.    The nests numbered 77, and there was evidence of others long  abandoned. There were 163 eggs, not counting 5 rotten ones, lying  outside; nearly all had 2 eggs in the nest; 3 had 4; 5 had 3; 4 had  1. One or two shells were found in the woods, evidently sucked by  Gulls or Ravens.    All in the nests were near hatching. One little one had his beak  out and was uttering a hoarse chirping; a dozen blue-bottle flies  around the hole in the shell were laying their eggs in it and  on his beak., This led us to examine all the nests that the flies  were buzzing around, and in each case (six) we found the same state  of affairs, a young one with his beak out and the flies \"blowing\"  around it. All of these were together in one corner, where were a  dozen nests, probably another colony of earlier arrival.    We took about a dozen photos of the place (large and small). Then  I set my camera with the long tube to get the old ones, and we went  to lunch at the other end of the island. It was densely wooded and  about an acre in extent, so we thought we should be forgotten. The  old ones circled high overhead but at last dropped, I thought, back  to the nests. After an hour and a half I returned to the ambush;  not a Pelican was there. Two Ravens flew high over, but the Pelicans  were far away, and all as when we went away, leaving the young to  struggle or get a death-chill as they might. So much for the pious  Pelican, the emblem of reckless devotion--a common, dirty little  cock Sparrow would put them all to shame.    We brought away only the 5 rotten eggs. About half of the old  Pelicans had horns on the bill.    On the island we saw a flock of White-winged Crossbills and heard  a Song-sparrow. Gulls were seen about. The white spruce cones littered  the ground and were full of seed, showing that no Redsquirrel was  on the island.    We left successfully by dashing out exactly as we came, between  the two dangerous currents, and got well away.          CHAPTER XVII    THE THIRD BUFFALO HUNT        The Indians are simply large children, and further, no matter how  reasonable your proposition, they take a long time to consider it  and are subject to all kinds of mental revulsion. So we were lucky  to get away from Fort Smith on July 4 with young Francois Bezkya  as guide. He was a full-blooded Chipewyan Indian, so full that he  had knowledge of no other tongue, and Billy had to be go-between.    Bezkya, the son of my old patient, came well recommended as a good  man and a moose-hunter. A \"good man\" means a strong, steady worker,  as canoeman or portager. He may be morally the vilest outcast unhung;  that in no wise modifies the phrase \"he is a good man.\" But more:  the present was a moosehunter; this is a wonderfully pregnant phrase.  Moose-hunting by fair stalking is the pinnacle of woodcraft. The  Crees alone, as a tribe, are supposed to be masters of the art;  but many of the Chipewyans are highly successful. One must be a  consummate trailer, a good shot, have tireless limbs and wind and  a complete knowledge of the animal's habits and ways of moving and  thinking. One must watch the wind, without ceasing, for no hunter  has the slightest chance of success if once the Moose should scent  him. This last is fundamental, a three-times sacred principle. Not  long ago one of these Chipewyans went to confessional. Although a  year had passed since last he got cleaned up, he could think of  nothing to confess. Oh! spotless soul! However, under pressure of  the priest, he at length remembered a black transgression. The fall  before, while hunting, he went to the windward of a thicket that seemed  likely to hold his Moose, because on the lee, the proper side, the  footing happened to be very bad, and so he lost his Moose. Yes!  there was indeed a dark shadow on his recent past.    A man may be a good hunter, i.e., an all-round trapper and woodman,  but not a moose-hunter. At Fort Smith are two or three scores of  hunters, and yet I am told there are only three moose-hunters. The  phrase is not usually qualified; he is, or is not, a moose-hunter.  Just as a man is, or is not, an Oxford M.A. The force, then, of  the phrase appears, and we were content to learn that young Bezkya,  besides knowing the Buffalo country, was also a good man and a  moose-hunter.    We "]]]
