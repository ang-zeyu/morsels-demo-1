Accordingly by Act of Parliament this  recommendation was given full effect to in the Transkeian Territories.  Subsequently the Drink Commission reported in favour of this prohibition  being extended to natives throughout the Colony. In Bechuanaland and  Basutoland, as well as in Natal, the law was adopted long ago, and  invariably worked well; nevertheless, to the shame of the Bond  organisation, it persistently preferred Mammon to God, and in the  strongest manner opposed any legislation whose result would be to save  the black man from destruction. Eventually an Act introduced by Sir  James Rose Innes was maimed before it was allowed to pass, so that  licensing Boards were only empowered to pass restrictive regulations on  the sale of alcohol to the coloured races \"short of total prohibition.\"    During the entire term of Bond rule in the Cape Colony not a sixpence  could be obtained for the encouragement of emigration from the United  Kingdom to the Cape Colony--nor would any land be ever granted for the  purpose. \"Africa for the Africanders\" has a very real and exact meaning,  and this was shown to demonstration when even the petty vote for  granting assisted passages to domestic servants and artisans was  objected to and refused. These people might in many cases come from  England, and therefore must be shut out.    The subtlety and diplomacy of the Bond were evinced in voting a grant  for the British Navy, and Mr. Hofmeyr took many opportunities of posing  as a loyal subject, but, as we shall prove in the context, the one great  underlying principle of the organisation was to obtain the mastery in  South Africa. All nationalities were invited to join. Africa must be  made great by a union of all its people, but those who read between the  lines and ascertained the real opinions of those who were guiding the  movement knew perfectly well that although the Imperial power might be  allowed at first to be a _faineant_ king, the Mayor of the Palace with  real authority was to be the people of Dutch extraction--the  Africanders--throughout Southern Africa.    We now come to the last days before the war, when Lord Milner could have  been easily checkmated if Mr. Hofmeyr had been able to influence the  Republican Governments. As every one knew, Mr. Kruger had positively  promised equal franchise rights to British subjects at the retrocession  of the Transvaal, and this promise was shamefully broken. In a  constitutional manner the Uitlanders vainly endeavoured to obtain  redress, and now appealed to the Imperial Government. The High  Commissioner merely did his evident duty, when at the Bloemfontein  Conference he insisted that at least a portion of the franchise rights  promised should be given. No doubt Mr. Hofmeyr would have seen his  opportunity here, and have consented in such a manner, and with such a  purpose, as to really render British interference nugatory, but the  Dutch Republicans had now the bit between their teeth. They were the  Lord's people, they had made all their preparations, and were perfectly  sure of victory. Mr. Kruger himself could not now stop the war, and the  astounding ultimatum came forth from the little Republic to the great  Empire: \"Recall your troops and send no more, or we will punish you.\" If  this gage had not been taken up the United Kingdom would have been  forced to take a back seat as a third-class power among the nations of  the world.    Having referred to the origin and growth of the Africander party, we  must now consider its aims. It must be admitted that its originators  were perfectly candid. We find them declaring in _De Patriot_ in 1882,  when referring to Confederation, that \"There is just one hindrance, and  that is the British flag. Let them take that away, and within a year the  confederation under the free Africander flag will be established. The  British must just have Simon's Bay as a naval and military station on  the road to India, and give over all the rest of Africa to the  Africanders.... It is we on top or they on top. They must be under or we  under.... Two things are wanted, artillery for the Transvaal ... to make  their own ammunition and to be well supplied with cannon. Now that the  war against the English Government is over (at Majuba Hill), the war  against the English language must begin. By Anglifying the girls they  infect the whole family life with the English speech.\"    We must now put into the box witnesses of a very important character  whose testimony, so far as the aims of the Bond are concerned, is  perfectly unexceptionable. These witnesses are Mr. Burgers, President of  the South African Republic, Sir John Brand, President of the Orange Free  State, Mr. Reitz, State Secretary of the South African Republic and  previously President of the Orange Free State, and Mr. Steyn,  Attorney-General and subsequently President of the Orange Free State. In  1875 President Burgers stated at a meeting held in Holland to consider  the Delagoa Bay railway scheme, that he hoped to see a New Holland eight  millions strong in South Africa, whence England shall have been  expelled. It was President Brand who said, \"Bartle Frere dreams of  United South Africa under the British flag; and so do I, but not under  the same flag.\" And when conducting a controversy with Kruger on the  subject of a Customs Union, Sir John Brand, disgusted with treachery,  cried aloud, \"The Bond seeks to raise a Republican flag in a country  with which we are at peace.\"[4]    Mr. Theo. Schreiner, whose honesty and truthfulness no man in South  Africa will deny, furnishes us with a circumstantial account of an  interview between himself and Mr. Reitz in the early eighties.[5] Then  Mr. Reitz was a judge at Bloemfontein, and was one of that band of  Africander patriots whose aspiration and conduct remind us naturally of  the aims, objects, and aspirations of the Young Ireland party under  Smith O'Brien. After in vain trying to enlist Mr. Schreiner as a  recruit, Mr. Reitz asked him to state the reason of his refusal. The  reply was, \"Because the ultimate object aimed at was the overthrow of  British power and the expulsion of the British flag from South Africa.\"  \"Well, what if it is so?\" was the rejoinder, to which Mr. Schreiner  replied, \"You don't suppose, do you, that the flag is going to disappear  without a tremendous struggle and fight?\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Reitz, \"I  suppose not, but what of that?\"    Mr. Steyn, of the Orange Free State, made the following statement to the  Rev. W. Tees, Presbyterian Minister in Durban:--    \"Great Britain has been completely taken by surprise.\"    \"Sir, this has been preparing since the year 1884.\"[6]    \"In both States?\" asked the clergyman.    \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"in both, and in the Colony also. The Transvaal  has been the arsenal, but those in the know in the Free State and in the  Colony have worked in unison with Kruger. The object was to oust the  British from South Africa, but it was not intended to do it all at once.  The first step was the consolidation of the two Republics as a Sovereign  International State, and later on an Africander rising at the right  moment.\"    Mr. Tees then asked a very pertinent question. \"Then do you mean to say  that when President Kruger attended the Bloemfontein Conference he knew  perfectly well that the proceedings were a farce, and that he really  meant to fight?\"    Mr. Steyn's reply was \"Yes.\"    At a conference between the Governments of the South African Republic  and Orange Free States held in 1887[7] relative to railways, we find Mr.  Kruger declaring: \"If you hook on to the Colony you cut our throat....  Let us speak frankly; we are not going to be dependent on England.\" Mr.  Wolmarans, following, declared: \"We have had much experience of her  Majesty's Government, and we will and must shake ourselves free. We are  still insufficiently prepared. We wish to get to the sea, especially  with an eye to future complications--you know our secret policy.\"  Subsequently the blunt soldier, General Joubert, said on the occasion of  an Uitlander complaining to him of the constant breach of Article 14 of  the 1884 Convention providing equality of treatment for the Uitlanders:  \"Equality! We don't want equality! We want to see who is to be boss in  South Africa.\"    Apropos to this subject it is not uninteresting to note from the debates  in the Volksraad of the South African Republic (see the _Johannesburg  Star_ of August 17, 1895) that the laws of the Transvaal were intended  to make the acquisition of the franchise by Uitlanders morally  impossible, and that at the end of one debate Mr. Otto merely became the  mouthpiece of the Burghers when he said, without any rebuke from the  chairman, \"Come on and fight. I say, come on and have it out; and the  sooner the better.\"    We must now put in documentary evidence to prove the real aims and  objects of the Africander Bond. The declaration of the Rev. S. J. Du  Toit, Judge Reitz, and Carl Borckenhagen is perfectly explicit. They  declare that \"The object of the Africander Bond is the establishment of  a South African Nationality through the cultivation of a true love of  this our fatherland. This object must be attained by the promotion and  defence of the national language, and by Africanders, both politically  and socially, making their power to be felt as a nation.\"    After the retrocession of the Transvaal the \"Africander Natie\" took a  very definite shape, as we find the _Patriot_ newspaper declaring that  \"God's hand has been visible in a more marked manner than ever before  seen since the days of the children of Israel. Proud England is  compelled to give the Boers back their land after they had been defeated  by a mere handful.\" The little respect which Africanders entertained for  British troops had entirely departed.    One of the articles of the Bond programme of principles contained the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#14)"],[1,"thing. And his lie had saved  Conniston as well as himself. There had been no time to question the  reason for the Englishman's neglect--for his apparent desertion of the  girl who had come across the sea to find him. Tonight it was sufficient  that HE was Conniston, and that to him the girl had fallen as a  precious heritage.    He stood up with her at last, holding her away from him a little so  that he could look into her face wet with tears and shining with  happiness. She reached up a hand to his face, so that it touched the  scar, and in her eyes he saw an infinite pity, a luminously tender glow  of love and sympathy and understanding that no measurements could  compass. Gently her hand stroked his scarred forehead. He felt his old  world slipping away from under his feet, and with his triumph there  surged over him a thankfulness for that indefinable something that had  come to him in time to give him the strength and the courage to lie.  For she believed him, utterly and without the shadow of a suspicion she  believed him.    \"Tomorrow you will help me to remember a great many things,\" he said.  \"And now will you let me send you to bed, Mary Josephine?\"    She was looking at the scar. \"And all those years I didn't know,\" she  whispered. \"I didn't know. They told me you were dead, but I knew it  was a lie. It was Colonel Reppington--\" She saw something in his face  that stopped her.    \"Derry, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?\"    \"I shall--tomorrow. But tonight I can see nothing and think of nothing  but you. Tomorrow--\"    She drew his head down swiftly and kissed the brand made by the heated  barrel of the Englishman's pistol. \"Yes, yes, we must go to bed now,  Derry,\" she cried quickly. \"You must not think too much. Tonight it  must just be of me. Tomorrow everything will come out right,  everything. And now you may send me to bed. Do you remember--\"    She caught herself, biting her lip to keep back the word.    \"Tell me,\" he urged. \"Do I remember what?\"    \"How you used to come in at the very last and tuck me in at night,  Derry? And how we used to whisper to ourselves there in the darkness,  and at last you would kiss me good-night? It was the kiss that always  made me go to sleep.\"    He nodded. \"Yes, I remember,\" he said.    He led her to the spare room, and brought in her two travel-worn bags,  and turned on the light. It was a man's room, but Mary Josephine stood  for a moment surveying it with delight.    \"It's home, Derry, real home,\" she whispered.    He did not explain to her that it was a borrowed home and that this was  his first night in it. Such unimportant details would rest until  tomorrow. He showed her the bath and its water system and then  explained to Wallie that his sister was in the house and he would have  to bunk in the kitchen. At the last he knew what he was expected to do,  what he must do. He kissed Mary Josephine good night. He kissed her  twice. And Mary Josephine kissed him and gave him a hug the like of  which he had never experienced until this night. It sent him back to  the fire with blood that danced like a drunken man's.    He turned the lights out and for an hour sat in the dying glow of the  birch. For the first time since he had come from Miriam Kirkstone's he  had the opportunity to think, and in thinking he found his brain  crowded with cold and unemotional fact. He saw his lie in all its naked  immensity. Yet he was not sorry that he had lied. He had saved  Conniston. He had saved himself. And he had saved Conniston's sister,  to love, to fight for, to protect. It had not been a Judas lie but a  lie with his heart and his soul and all the manhood in him behind it.  To have told the truth would have made him his own executioner, it  would have betrayed the dead Englishman who had given to him his name  and all that he possessed, and it would have dragged to a pitiless  grief the heart of a girl for whom the sun still continued to shine. No  regret rose before him now. He felt no shame. All that he saw was the  fight, the tremendous fight, ahead of him, his fight to make good as  Conniston, his fight to play the game as Conniston would have him play  it. The inspiration that had come to him as he stood facing the storm  from the western mountains possessed him again. He would go to the  river's end as he had planned to go before McDowell told him of Shan  Tung and Miriam Kirkstone. And he would not go alone. Mary Josephine  would go with him.    It was midnight when he rose from the big chair and went to his room.  The door was closed. He opened it and entered. Even as his hand groped  for the switch on the wall, his nostrils caught the scent of something  which was familiar and yet which should not have been there. It filled  the room, just as it had filled the big hall at the Kirkstone house,  the almost sickening fragrance of agallochum burned in a cigarette. It  hung like a heavy incense. Keith's eyes glared as he scanned the room  under the lights, half expecting to see Shan Tung sitting there waiting  for him. It was empty. His eyes leaped to the two windows. The shade  was drawn at one, the other was up, and the window itself was open an  inch or two above the sill. Keith's hand gripped his pistol as he went  to it and drew the curtain. Then he turned to the table on which were  the reading lamp and Brady's pipes and tobacco and magazines. On an  ash-tray lay the stub of a freshly burned cigarette. Shan Tung had come  secretly, but he had made no effort to cover his presence.    It was then that Keith saw something on the table which had not been  there before. It was a small, rectangular, teakwood box no larger than  a half of the palm of his hand. He had noticed Miriam Kirkstone's  nervous fingers toying with just such a box earlier in the evening.  They were identical in appearance. Both were covered with an exquisite  fabric of oriental carving, and the wood was stained and polished until  it shone with the dark luster of ebony. Instantly it flashed upon him  that this was the same box he had seen at Miriam's. She had sent it to  him, and Shan Tung had been her messenger. The absurd thought was in  his head as he took up a small white square of card that lay on top of  the box. The upper side of this card was blank; on the other side, in a  script as exquisite in its delicacy as the carving itself, were the  words:    \"WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF SHAN TUNG.\"    In another moment Keith had opened the box. Inside was a carefully  folded slip of paper, and on this paper was written a single line.  Keith's heart stopped beating, and his blood ran cold as he read what  it held for him, a message of doom from Shan Tung in nine words:    \"WHAT HAPPENED TO DERWENT CONNISTON? DID YOU KILL HIM?\"          XI      Stunned by a shock that for a few moments paralyzed every nerve center  in his body, John Keith stood with the slip of white paper in his  hands. He was discovered! That was the one thought that pounded like a  hammer in his brain. He was discovered in the very hour of his triumph  and exaltation, in that hour when the world had opened its portals of  joy and hope for him again and when life itself, after four years of  hell, was once more worth the living. Had the shock come a few hours  before, he would have taken it differently. He was expecting it then.  He had expected it when he entered McDowell's office the first time. He  was prepared for it afterward. Discovery, failure, and death were  possibilities of the hazardous game he was playing, and he was  unafraid, because he had only his life to lose, a life that was not  much more than a hopeless derelict at most. Now it was different. Mary  Josephine had come like some rare and wonderful alchemy to transmute  for him all leaden things into gold. In a few minutes she had upset the  world. She had literally torn aside for him the hopeless chaos in which  he saw himself struggling, flooding him with the warm radiance of a  great love and a still greater desire. On his lips he could feel the  soft thrill of her good-night kiss and about his neck the embrace of  her soft arms. She had not gone to sleep yet. Across in the other room  she was thinking of him, loving him; perhaps she was on her knees  praying for him, even as he held in his fingers Shan Tung's mysterious  forewarning of his doom.    The first impulse that crowded in upon him was that of flight, the  selfish impulse of personal salvation. He could get away. The night  would swallow him up. A moment later he was mentally castigating  himself for the treachery of that impulse to Mary Josephine. His  floundering senses began to readjust themselves.    Why had Shan Tung given him this warning? Why had he not gone straight  to Inspector McDowell with the astounding disclosure of the fact that  the man supposed to be Derwent Conniston was not Derwent Conniston, but  John Keith, the murderer of Miriam Kirkstone's father?    The questions brought to Keith a new thrill. He read the note again. It  was a definite thing stating a certainty and not a guess. Shan Tung had  not shot at random. He knew. He knew that he was not Derwent Conniston  but John Keith. And he believed that he had killed the Englishman to  steal his identity. In the face of these things he had not gone to  McDowell! Keith's eyes fell upon the card again. \"With the compliments  of Shan Tung.\" What did the words mean? Why had Shan Tung written them  unless--with his compliments--he was giving him a warning and the  chance to save himself?    His immediate alarm grew less. The longer he contemplated the slip of  paper in his hand, the more he became convinced that the inscrutable  Shan Tung was the last individual in the world to stage a bit of  melodrama without some good reason for it. There was but one conclusion  he could arrive at. The Chinaman was playing a game of his own, and he  had taken this unusual way of advising Keith to make a getaway while  the going was good. It was evident "]]]
