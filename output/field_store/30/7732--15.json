[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#14)"],[1," help  wondering why.    There was, however, another subject upon which Raffles exercised a much  more vexatious reserve. Had I been more sympathetically interested in  Teddy Garland, no doubt I should have sought an earlier explanation of  his sensational disappearance, instead of leaving it to the last. My  interest in the escapade, however, was considerably quickened by the  prompt refusal of Raffles to tell me a word about it.    \"No, Bunny,\" said he, \"I'm not going to give the boy away. His father  knows, and I know--and that's enough.\"    \"Was it your paragraph in the papers that brought him back?\"    Raffles paused, cigarette between fingers, in a leonine perambulation of  his cage; and his smile was a sufficient affirmative.    \"I mustn't talk about it, really, Bunny,\" was his actual reply. \"It  wouldn't be fair.\"    \"I don't think it's conspicuously fair on me,\" I retorted, \"to set me to  cover up your pal's tracks, to give me a lie like that to act all day,  and then not to take one into the secret when he does turn up. I call it  trading on a fellow's good-nature--not that I care a curse!\"    \"Then that's all right, Bunny,\" said Raffles genially. \"If you cared I  should feel bound to apologise to you for the very rotten way you've been  treated all round; as it is I give you my word not to take you in with me  if I have another dip at Dan Levy.\"    \"But you're not seriously thinking of it, Raffles?\"    \"I am if I see half a chance of squaring him short of wilful murder.\"    \"You mean a chance of settling his account against the Garlands?\"    \"To say nothing of my own account against Dan Levy! I'm spoiling for  another round with that sportsman, Bunny, for its own sake quite apart  from these poor pals of mine.\"    \"And you really think the game would be worth a candle that might fire  the secret mine of your life and blow your character to blazes?\"    One could not fraternise with Raffles without contracting a certain  facility in fluent and florid metaphor; and this parody of his lighter  manner drew a smile from my model. But it was the bleak smile of a man  thinking of other things, and I thought he nodded rather sadly. He was  standing by the open window; he turned and leant out as I had done that  interminable twenty-four hours ago; and I longed to know his thoughts,  to guess what it was that I knew he had not told me, that I could not  divine for myself. There was something behind his mask of gay  pugnacity; nay, there was something behind the good Garlands and their  culpably commonplace misfortunes. They were the pretext. But could they  be the Cause?    The night was as still as the night before. In another moment a flash  might have enlightened me. But, in the complete cessation of sound in  the room, I suddenly heard one, soft and stealthy but quite distinct,  outside the door.          CHAPTER IX    A Triple Alliance      It was the intermittent sound of cautious movements, the creak of a sole  not repeated for a great many seconds, the all but inaudible passing of a  hand over the unseen side of the door leading into the lobby. It may be  that I imagined more than I actually heard of the last detail;  nevertheless I was as sure of what was happening as though the door had  been plate-glass. Yet there was the outer door between lobby and landing  and that I distinctly remembered Raffles shutting behind him when we  entered. Unable to attract his attention now, and never sorry to be the  one to take the other by surprise, I listened without breathing until  assurance was doubly sure, then bounded out of my chair without a word.  And there was a resounding knock at the inner door, even as I flung it  open upon a special evening edition of Mr. Daniel Levy, a resplendent  figure with a great stud blazing in a frilled shirt, white waistcoat and  gloves, opera-hat and cigar, and all the other insignia of a nocturnal  vulgarian about town.    \"May I come in?\" said he with unctuous affability.    \"May you!\" I took it upon myself to shout. \"I like that, seeing that you  came in long ago! I heard you all right--you were listening at the  door--probably looking through the keyhole--and you only knocked when I  jumped up to open it!\"    \"My dear Bunny!\" exclaimed Raffles, a reproving hand upon my shoulder.  And he bade the unbidden guest a jovial welcome.    \"But the outer door was shut,\" I expostulated. \"He must have forced it or  else picked the lock.\"    \"Why not, Bunny? Love isn't the only thing that laughs at locksmiths,\"  remarked Raffles with exasperating geniality.    \"Neither are swell mobsmen!\" cried Dan Levy, not more ironically than  Raffles, only with a heavier type of irony.    Raffles conducted him to a chair. Levy stepped behind it and grasped the  back as though prepared to break the furniture on our heads if necessary.  Raffles offered him a drink; it was declined with a crafty grin that made  no secret of a base suspicion.    \"I don't drink with the swell mob,\" said the money-lender.    \"My dear Mr. Levy,\" returned Raffles, \"you're the very man I wanted to  see, and nobody could possibly be more welcome in my humble quarters;  but that's the fourth time to-day I've heard you make use of an obsolete  expression. You know as well as I do that the slap-bang-here-we-are-again  type of work is a thing of the past. Where are the jolly dogs of the old  song now?\"    \"'Ere at the Albany!\" said Levy. \"Here in your rooms, Mr. A.J. Raffles.\"    \"Well, Bunny,\" said Raffles, \"I suppose we must both plead guilty to a  hair of the jolly dog that bit him--eh?\"    \"You know what I mean,\" our visitor ground out through his teeth. \"You're  cracksmen, magsmen, mobsmen, the two of you; so you may as well both own  up to it.\"    \"Cracksmen? Magsmen? Mobsmen?\" repeated Raffles, with his head on one  side. \"What does the kind gentleman mean, Bunny? Wait! I have  it--thieves! Common thieves!\"    And he laughed loud and long in the moneylender's face and mine.    \"You may laugh,\" said Levy. \"I'm too old a bird for your chaff; the  only wonder is I didn't spot you right off when we were abroad.\" He  grinned malevolently. \"Shall I tell you when I did tumble to it--Mr.  Ananias J. Raffles?\"    \"Daniel in the liars' den,\" murmured Raffles, wiping the tears from his  eyes. \"Oh, yes, do tell us anything you like; this is the best  entertainment we've had for a long time, isn't it, Bunny?\"    \"Chalks!\" said I.    \"I thought of it this morning,\" proceeded the money-lender, with a  grim contempt for all our raillery, \"when you played your pretty trick  upon me, so glib and smooth, and up to every move, the pair of you!  One borrowing the money, and the other paying me back in my very own  actual coin!\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"there was no crime in that.\"    \"Oh, yes, there was,\" replied Levy, with a wide wise grin; \"there was the  one crime you two ought to know better than ever to commit, if you call  yourselves what I called you just now. The crime that you committed was  the crime of being found out; but for that I should never have suspected  friend Ananias of that other job at Carlsbad; no, not even when I saw his  friends so surprised to hear that he'd been out there--a strapping young  chap like 'im! Yes,\" cried the money-lender, lifting the chair and  jobbing it down on the floor; \"this morning was when I thought of it, but  this afternoon was when I jolly well knew.\"    Raffles was no longer smiling; his eyes were like points of steel, his  lips like a steel trap.    \"I saw what you thought,\" said he, disdainfully. \"And you still  seriously think I took your wife's necklace and hid it in the woods?\"    \"I know you did.\"    \"Then what the devil are you doing here alone?\" cried Raffles. \"Why  didn't you bring along a couple of good men and true from Scotland  Yard? Here I am, Mr. Levy, entirely at your service. Why don't you give  me in charge?\"    Levy chuckled consumedly--ventriloquously--behind his three gold buttons  and his one diamond stud.    \"P'r'aps I'm not such a bad sort as you think,\" said he. \"An' p'r'aps you  two gentlemen are not such bad sorts as _I_ thought.\"    \"Gentlemen once more, eh?\" said Raffles. \"Isn't that rather a quick  recovery for swell magsmen, or whatever we were a minute ago?\"    \"P'r'aps I never really thought you quite so bad as all that, Mr.  Raffles.\"    \"Perhaps you never really thought I took the necklace, Mr. Levy?\"    \"I know you took it,\" returned Levy, his new tone of crafty conciliation  softening to a semblance of downright apology. \"But I believe you did put  it back where you knew it'd be found. And I begin to think you only took  it for a bit o' fun!\"    \"If he took it at all,\" said I. \"Which is absurd.\"    \"I only wish I had!\" exclaimed Raffles, with gratuitous audacity. \"I  agree with you, Mr. Levy, it would have been more like a bit of fun than  anything that came my way on the human rubbish-heap we were both  inhabiting for our sins.\"    \"The kind of fun that appeals to you?\" suggested Levy, with a very  shrewd glance.    \"It would,\" said Raffles, \"I feel sure.\"    \"'Ow would you care for another bit o' fun like it, Mr. Raffles?\"    \"Don't say 'another,' please.\"    \"Well, would you like to try your 'and at the game again?\"    \"Not 'again,' Mr. Levy; and my 'prentice' hand, if you don't mind.\"    \"I beg pardon; my mistake,\" said Levy, with becoming gravity.    \"How would I like to try my prentice hand on picking and stealing for the  pure fun of the thing? Is that it, Mr. Levy?\"    Raffles was magnificent now; but so was the other in his own way. And  once more I could but admire the tact with which Levy had discarded his  favourite cudgels, and the surprising play that he was making with the  buttoned foil.    \"It'd be more picking than stealing,\" said he. \"Tricky picking too,  Raffles, but innocent enough even for an amatoor.\"    \"I thank you, Mr. Levy. So you have a definite case in mind?\"    \"I have--a case of recovering a man's own property.\"    \"You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/984"],[0,"Who Was Who: 5000 B.
