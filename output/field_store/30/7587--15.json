Nevertheless, following decades of   mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was   plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of   hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President   MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program   that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable   growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar   since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20   years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by   repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The   economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by   inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending.   The government's major short term objective is encouraging exports,   e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995,   the government had to deal with the spillover from international   financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican   peso. In addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the   government. Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment   surprisingly has doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus   and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser   degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains to be done in the 1990s   in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, extending the   recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of unemployment.

That is the German account of it,  and it may well be true. It was a kindly act.    Probably had it not been for this the two men would have died among  those desolate craters; no one would have known, and no one could have  been blamed for it.    The contrast of this spark of imperial kindness against the gloom of  the background of the war that the Kaiser made is a pleasant thing to  see, even though it illuminates for only a moment the savage darkness  in which our days are plunged. It was a kindness that probably will  long be remembered to him. Even we, his enemies, will remember it. And  who knows but that when most he needs it his reward for the act will  be given him.    For Judas, they say, once in his youth, gave his cloak, out of  compassion, to a shivering beggar, who sat shaken with ague, in rags,  in bitter need. And the years went by and Judas forgot his deed. And  long after, in Hell, Judas they say was given one day's respite at the  end of every year because of this one kindness he had done so long  since in his youth. And every year he goes, they say, for a day and  cools himself among the Arctic bergs; once every year for century  after century.    Perhaps some sailor on watch on a misty evening blown far out of his  course away to the north saw something ghostly once on an iceberg  floating by, or heard some voice in the dimness that seemed like the  voice of man, and came home with this weird story. And perhaps, as the  story passed from lip to lip, men found enough justice in it to  believe it true. So it came down the centuries.    Will seafarers ages hence on dim October evenings, or on nights when  the moon is ominous through mist, red and huge and uncanny, see a  lonely figure sometimes on the loneliest part of the sea, far north of  where the Lusitania sank, gathering all the cold it can? Will they see  it hugging a crag of iceberg wan as itself, helmet, cuirass and ice  pale-blue in the mist together? Will it look towards them with  ice-blue eyes through the mist, and will they question it, meeting on  those bleak seas? Will it answer--or will the North wind howl like  voices? Will the cry of seals be heard, and ice floes grinding, and  strange birds lost upon the wind that night, or will it speak to them  in those distant years and tell them how it sinned, betraying man?    It will be a grim, dark story in that lonely part of the sea, when he  confesses to sailors, blown too far north, the dreadful thing he  plotted against man. The date on which he is seen will be told from  sailor to sailor. Queer taverns of distant harbours will know it well.  Not many will care to be at sea that day, and few will risk being  driven by stress of weather on the Kaiser's night to the bergs of the  haunted part of sea.    And yet for all the grimness of the pale-blue phantom, with cuirass  and helmet and eyes shimmering on deadly icebergs, and yet for all the  sorrow of the wrong he did against man, the women drowned and the  children, and all the good ships gone, yet will the horrified mariners  meeting him in the mist grudge him no moment of the day he has earned,  or the coolness he gains from the bergs, because of the kindness he  did to the wounded men. For the mariners in their hearts are kindly  men, and what a soul gains from kindness will seem to them well  deserved.          Last Scene of All      After John Calleron was hit he carried on in a kind of twilight of the  mind. Things grew dimmer and calmer; harsh outlines of events became  blurred; memories came to him; there was a singing in his ears like  far-off bells. Things seemed more beautiful than they had a while ago;  to him it was for all the world like evening after some quiet sunset,  when lawns and shrubs and woods and some old spire look lovely in the  late light, and one reflects on past days. Thus he carried on, seeing  things dimly. And what is sometimes called \"the roar of battle,\"  those aerial voices that snarl and moan and whine and rage at  soldiers, had grown dimmer too. It all seemed further away, and  littler, as far things are. He still heard the bullets: there is  something so violently and intensely sharp in the snap of passing  bullets at short ranges that you hear them in deepest thought, and  even in dreams. He heard them, tearing by, above all things else. The  rest seemed fainter and dimmer, and smaller and further away.    He did not think he was very badly hit, but nothing seemed to matter  as it did a while ago. Yet he carried on.    And then he opened his eyes very wide and found he was back in London  again in an underground train. He knew it at once by the look of it.  He had made hundreds of journeys, long ago, by those trains. He knew  by the dark, outside, that it had not yet left London; but what was  odder than that, if one stopped to think of it, was that he knew  exactly where it was going. It was the train that went away out into  the country where he used to live as a boy. He was sure of that  without thinking.    When he began to think how he came to be there he remembered the war  as a very far-off thing. He supposed he had been unconscious a very  long time. He was all right now.    Other people were sitting beside him on the same seat. They all seemed  like people he remembered a very long time ago. In the darkness  opposite, beyond the windows of the train, he could see their  reflections clearly. He looked at the reflections but could not quite  remember.    A woman was sitting on his left. She was quite young. She was more  like some one that he most deeply remembered than all the others were.  He gazed at her, and tried to clear his mind.    He did not turn and stare at her, but he quietly watched her  reflection before him in the dark. Every detail of her dress, her  young face, her hat, the little ornaments she wore, were minutely  clear before him, looking out of the dark. So contented she looked you  would say she was untouched by war.    As he gazed at the clear calm face and the dress that seemed neat  though old and, like all things, so faraway, his mind grew clearer and  clearer. It seemed to him certain it was the face of his mother, but  from thirty years ago, out of old memories and one picture. He felt  sure it was his mother as she had been when he was very small. And yet  after thirty years how could he know? He puzzled to try and be quite  sure. But how she came to be there, looking like that, out of those  oldest memories, he did not think of at all.    He seemed to be hugely tired by many things and did not want to think.  Yet he was very happy, more happy even than tired men just come home  all new to comfort.    He gazed and gazed at the face in the dark. And then he felt quite  sure.    He was about to speak. Was she looking at him? Was she watching him,  he wondered. He glanced for the first time to his own reflection in  that clear row of faces.    His own reflection was not there, but blank dark showed between his  two neighbours. And then he knew he was dead.          Old England      Towards winter's end on a high, big, bare down, in the south of  England, John Plowman was plowing. He was plowing the brown field at  the top of the hill, good soil of the clay; a few yards lower down was  nothing but chalk, with shallow flinty soil and steep to plow; so they  let briars grow there. For generations his forbears had plowed on the  top of that hill. John did not know how many. The hills were very old;  it might have been always.    He scarcely looked to see if his furrow was going straight. The work  he was doing was so much in his blood that he could almost feel if  furrows were straight or not. Year after year they moved on the same  old landmarks; thorn trees and briars mostly guided the plow, where  they stood on the untamed land beyond; the thorn trees grew old at  their guiding, and still the furrows varied not by the breadth of a  hoof-mark.    John, as he plowed, had leisure to meditate on much besides the crops;  he knew so much of the crops that his thoughts could easily run free  from them; he used to meditate on who they were that lived in briar  and thorn tree, and danced as folk said all through midsummer night,  and sometimes blessed and sometimes harmed the crops; for he knew that  in Old England were wonderful ancient things, odder and older things  than many folks knew. And his eyes had leisure to see much beside the  furrows, for he could almost feel the furrows going straight.    One day at his plowing, as he watched the thorn ahead, he saw the  whole big hill besides, looking south, and the lands below it; one day  he saw in the bright sun of late winter a horseman riding the road  through the wide lands below. The horseman shone as he rode, and wore  white linen over what was shining, and on the linen was a big red  cross. \"One of them knights,\" John Plowman said to himself or his  horse, \"going to them crusades.\" And he went on with his plowing all  that day satisfied, and remembered what he had seen for years, and  told his son.    For there is in England, and there always was, mixed with the needful  things that feed or shelter the race, the wanderer-feeling for  romantic causes that runs deep and strange through the other thoughts,  as the Gulf Stream runs through the sea. Sometimes generations of John  Plowman's family would go by and no high romantic cause would come to  sate that feeling. They would work on just the same though a little  sombrely, as though some good thing had been grudged them. And then  the Crusades had come, and John Plowman had seen the Red Cross knight  go by, riding towards the sea in the morning, and Jon Plowman was  satisfied.    Some generations later a man of the same name was plowing the same  hill. They still plowed the brown clay at the top and left the slope  wild, though"]]]
