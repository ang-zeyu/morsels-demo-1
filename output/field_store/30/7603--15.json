On his  arrival the first house he visited was that occupied by Elder Brigham  Young, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve, who lay sick. Joseph  healed him, then he arose and accompanied the Prophet on his visit  to others who were in the same condition. They visited Elder Wilford  Woodruff, also Elders Orson Pratt, and John Taylor, all of whom were  living in Montrose. They also accompanied him.    \"The next place they visited was the home of Elijah Fordham, who was  supposed to be about breathing his last. When the company entered the  room, the Prophet of God walked up to the dying man and took hold of  his right hand and spoke to him; but Brother Fordham was unable to  speak, his eyes were set in his head like glass, and he seemed entirely  unconscious of all around him. Joseph held his hand and looked into  his eyes in silence for a length of time. A change in the countenance  of Brother Fordham was soon perceptible to all present. His sight  returned, and upon Joseph asking him if he knew him, he, in a low  whisper, answered 'Yes.' Joseph asked him if he had faith to be healed.  He answered, 'I fear it is too late; if you had come sooner I think  I would have been healed.' The Prophet said 'Do you believe in Jesus  Christ?' He answered in a feeble voice, 'I do.' Joseph then stood  erect, still holding his hand in silence several moments; Then he spoke  in a very loud voice, saying, 'Brother Fordham, I command you, in the  name of Jesus Christ, to arise from this bed and be made whole.' His  voice was like the voice of God, and not of man. It seemed as though  the house shook to its very foundations. Brother Fordham arose from his  bed, and was immediately made whole. His feet were bound in poultices  which he kicked off; then putting on his clothes he ate a bowl of bread  and milk and followed the Prophet into the street.    \"The company next visited Brother Joseph Bates Noble, who lay very  sick. He also was healed by the Prophet. By this time the wicked  became alarmed and followed the company into Brother Noble's house.  After Noble was healed, all kneeled down to pray. Brother Fordham was  mouth, and while praying he fell to the floor. The Prophet arose, and  on looking around he saw quite a number of unbelievers in the house,  whom he ordered out. When the room was cleared of the wicked, Brother  Fordham came to and finished his prayer.    \"After healing the sick in Montrose, all the company followed Joseph to  the bank of the river, where he was going to take the boat to return  home. While waiting for the boat, a man from the West, who had seen  that the sick and dying were healed, asked Joseph if he would not go to  his house and heal two of his children who were very sick. They were  twins and were three months old. Joseph told the man he could not go,  but he would send some one to heal them. He told Elder Woodruff to go  with the man and heal his children. At the same time he took from his  pocket a silk bandanna handkerchief, and gave to Brother Woodruff,  telling him to wipe the faces of the children with it, and they should  be healed; and remarked at the same time: 'As long as you keep that  handkerchief it shall remain a league between you and me.' Elder  Woodruff did as he was commanded, and the children were healed, and he  keeps the handkerchief to this day.    \"There were many sick whom Joseph could not visit, so he counseled the  Twelve to go and visit and heal them, and many were healed under their  hands. On the day following that upon which the above-described events  took place, Joseph sent Elders George A. and Don Carlos Smith up the  river to heal the sick. They went up as far as Ebenezer Robinson's--one  or two miles--and did as they were commanded, and the sick were  healed.\" _Leaves from my Journal_, (Wilford Woodruff) Ch. XIX.    5. \"Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of  His servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him trust  in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.    \"Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with  sparks. Walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have  kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\"    6. This has reference to the Hotchkiss purchase which had just recently  been laid out as part of the rapidly growing town of Nauvoo. It  constituted the north west part of the city, extending some distance  along the river front, and back on to the height of land overlooking  the river bottom.    7. The departure of these two Elders upon their mission to England is  worthy of a more extended notice. A brother by the name of Charles  Hubbard sent a boy with a team to take them a day's journey on their  way. Elder Kimball left his wife in bed shaking with ague, and all his  children sick. It was only by the assistance of some of the brethren  that Heber himself could climb into the wagon. \"It seemed to me,\" he  remarked afterwards in relating the circumstance, \"as though my very  inmost parts would melt within me at the thought of leaving my family  in such a condition, as it were, almost in the arms of death. I felt as  though I could scarcely endure it.\" \"Hold up!\" said he to the teamster,  who had just started, \"Brother Brigham, this is pretty tough, but let  us rise and give them a cheer.\" Brigham, with much difficulty, rose to  his feet, and joined Elder Kimball in swinging his hat and shouting,  \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, for Israel!\" The two sisters, hearing the  cheer came to the door--sister Kimball with great difficulty--and waved  a farewell; and the two apostles continued their journey, without  purse, without scrip, for England.    8. See vol. III, pp. 379-381.    9. That is to say, to quote from the revelation establishing the  High Council--\"Whenever an High Council of the church is regularly  organized, * * * it shall be the duty of the Twelve Counselors to cast  lots by numbers and thereby ascertain, who of the Twelve shall speak  first, commencing with number one, and so in succession to number  twelve.\"--_Doctrine and Covenants, Section cii_.    {19}        CHAPTER II.    The Prophet's Journey to Washington--The Petition of the Saints to the  Congress of the United States for Redress of the Wrongs Inflicted upon  Them in Missouri.    [Sidenote: Departure of the Prophet for Washington.]    _Tuesday, 29_.--I left Nauvoo accompanied by Sidney Rigdon, Elias  Higbee, and Orrin P. Rockwell, in a two-horse carriage for the city  of Washington, to lay before the Congress of the United States, the  grievances of the Saints while in Missouri. We passed through Carthage,  and stayed at Judge Higbee's over night, and the next day we arrived at  Quincy.    _Thursday, 31_.--We tarried at Quincy to complete the necessary papers  for our mission. Elder Rigdon was sick.    _Friday, November 1_.--We pursued our journey towards Springfield,  Illinois, and put up with Brother Wilber, where we found Doctor Robert  D. Foster, who administered to Elder Rigdon.    _Saturday, 2_.--Continued our journey, and during the day put up with  a friend on the bank of the Illinois river, so that Dr. Foster, who  accompanied us so far for that purpose, might administer medicine to  Elder Rigdon again.    _Sunday, 3_.--Continued our journey and staid with a friend over night.  Dr. Foster continued to accompany us.    [Sidenote: Progress of the Twelve towards England.]    Elders Young and Kimball arrived at Cleveland, Ohio, {20} about 1  o'clock in the morning; and while waiting for the stage until about  noon, Elders Smith, Turley, and Hedlock, who left them at Terre Haute,  drove up, having picked up Elder Taylor by the way, he having been  left sick by his company in the east part of Indiana. They were in  good health, compared with what they had been, and in fine spirits.  George A. Smith tarried in Cleveland till the next day, to visit his  relatives. Brothers Young, Kimball, Taylor, and Turley rode in the  stage, and Brother Hedlock and Mr. Murray in their wagon to Willoughby,  and from thence they all rode into Kirtland together.    [Sidenote: Canadian Saints En Route for Nauvoo.]    _Monday, 4_.--We arrived at Springfield, and put up with Brother  John Snider. When within one mile of the city, we met William Law  [1] and company with seven wagons from Canada, who returned with us  to Springfield, and tarried while we did, until the 8th. I preached  several times while here. General James Adams, [2] judge of probate,  heard of me, sought me out, and took me home with him, and treated me  like a father.    President Brigham Young and his brother John visited their sister, Mrs.  Kent.    There was some division of sentiment among the Kirtland brethren.    {21} _Thursday, 7_.--The High Council of Iowa completed their  organization at Elijah Fordham's, at Montrose.    _Friday, 8_.--We started from Springfield. Dr. Foster having concluded  to continue on the journey on account of Elder Rigdon's health, which  was still quite poor. We pursued our journey through Indiana towards  Columbus, Ohio. The traveling was bad, and our progress slow.    _Sunday, 10_.--Elder Taylor preached in the forenoon, and Elder Kimball  in the afternoon, in the House of the Lord at Kirtland.    _Thursday, 14_.--Elder Orson Hyde left Commerce, Illinois, intending  to go east as far as Philadelphia. He had just begun to recover from a  four months' illness of fever and ague.    [Sidenote: Elder Taylor Anointed in the Kirtland Temple.]    _Sunday, 17_.--President Young preached in the House of the Lord in the  forenoon, and John Taylor in the afternoon. In the evening, President  Brigham Young anointed Elder John Taylor in the House of the Lord, and  Elder Daniel S. Miles anointed Theodore Turley, all of which was sealed  with the shout of Hosanna.    _Monday, 18_.--President Young visited Brother R. Potter at Newbury,  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#14)"],[1,"with  an explanation of the various figures on the plate and preceding the  Prophet's translation of the Book of Abraham, taken from the _Times and  Seasons_.]    [Sidenote: Attitude of the Press.]    Several of the most widely circulated papers are beginning to exhibit  \"Mormonism\" in its true light. The first out of a _fac-simile_ from the  Book of Abraham, has been republished both in the New York _Herald_  and in the _Dollar Week Bostonian_, as well as in the _Boston Daily  Ledger_, edited by Mr. Bartlett; together with the translation from the  Book of Abraham.    _Tuesday, 17_.--I was about home, and at the office through the day.  In the evening went to Brother John Snyder's to see Clark Leal, of  Fountain Green, concerning a quarter section of land.    _Affidavit of John C. Bennett_.        State of Illinois, city of Nauvoo, personally appeared before me,      Daniel H. Wells, an Alderman of the said city of Nauvoo, John C.      Bennett, who being duly sworn, according to law, desposeth and      sayeth, that he was never taught anything in the least contrary      to the strictest principles of the Gospel, or of virtue or of the      laws of God or man, under any circumstances, or upon any occasion,      either directly or indirectly, in word or deed, by Joseph Smith,      and that he never knew the said Smith to countenance any improper      conduct whatever either in public or private; and that he never did      teach to me in private that an illegal, illicit intercourse with      females, was under any circumstance justifiable, and that I never      knew him to so teach others.        JOHN C. BENNETT.        Sworn to and subscribed before me, this 17th day of May, A. D. 1842.        DANIEL H. WELLS, Alderman.    {12}John C. Bennett resigned the office of mayor of Nauvoo.    _Wednesday, 18_.--Rode on horseback, accompanied by Dr. Richards and  Clark Leal, to John Benbow's, and searched out the N. E. quarter of  section 15, 6 N. 8 W. and contracted for the refusal of the same, at  three dollars per acre; dined at Brother Benbow's, visited Brother  Sayer's, &c., which, with business at the different offices, closed the  day.    There was a general representation of the branches in the Eastern  States, at a conference of the Church at New York.    [Sidenote: Resignation of Bennett as Mayor of Nauvoo.]    _Thursday, 19_.--It rained, and I was at home until one o'clock; when I  attended a special session of the city council. John C. Bennett having  discovered that his whoredoms and abominations were fast coming to  light, and that the indignation of an insulted and abused people were  rising rapidly against him, thought best to make a virtue of necessity,  and try to make it appear that he was innocent, by resigning his office  of mayor, which the council most gladly accepted; and Joseph Smith was  elected mayor of the city of Nauvoo by the council, and Hyrum Smith  vice-mayor.    While the election was going forward, I received and wrote the  following revelation:    _Revelation_.        Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, by the      voice of my Spirit, Hiram Kimball has been insinuating evil, and      forming evil opinions against you, with others; and if he continue      in them, he and they shall be accursed, for I am the Lord thy God,      and will stand by thee and bless thee. Amen.    This I threw across the room to Hiram Kimball, one of the councillors.  After the election, I spoke at some length concerning the evil reports  which were abroad in the city concerning myself, and the necessity of  counteracting the {13} designs of our enemies, establishing a night  watch, &c., whereupon the council resolved that the mayor be authorized  to establish a night watch, and control the same.    William Smith was elected councilor in place of Joseph Smith, elected  mayor; George A. Smith councilor, in place of Hugh McFall, removed from  the city.    On account of the reports in circulation in the city this day,  concerning the ex-mayor, and to quiet the public mind, before the  council closed, I asked John C. Bennett if he had aught against me,  when Dr. Bennett arose, before the council and a house filled with  spectators, and replied:    _Statement of John C. Bennett before the City Council_.        I know what I am about, and the heads of the Church know what      they are about, I expect; I have no difficulty with the heads of      the Church. I publicly avow that any one who has said that I have      stated that General Joseph Smith has given me authority to hold      illicit intercourse with women is a liar in the face of God. Those      who have said it are damned liars; they are infernal liars. He      never either in public or private gave me any such authority or      license, and any person who states it is a scoundrel and a liar.      I have heard it said, that I would become a second Avard, by      withdrawing from the Church, and that I was at variance with the      heads, and would use an influence against them, because I resigned      the office of mayor. This is false, I have no difficulty with      the heads of the Church, and I intend to continue with you, and      hope the time may come when I may be restored to full confidence,      fellowship, and my former standing in the Church, and that my      conduct may be such as to warrant my restoration, and should the      time ever come that I may have the opportunity to test my faith, it      will then be known whether I am a traitor or true man.    I then said to him, \"Will you please state definitely whether you know  anything against my character, either in public or private?\" General  Bennett replied, \"I do not. In all my intercourse with General Smith,  in public and in private, he has been strictly virtuous.\"    I then made some pertinent remarks before the council, concerning those  who had been guilty of circulating false reports, &c., and said:    {14}Let one twelve months see if Brother Joseph is not called for, to  go to every part of the city to keep them out of their graves; and I  turn the keys upon them from this hour, if they will not repent and  stop their lyings and surmisings, let God curse them, and let their  tongues cleave to the roofs of their mouths.    [Sidenote: Charges Against Robert D. Foster.]    _Friday, 20_.--Charges having been preferred against Robert D. Foster,  by Samuel H. Smith before a special council, for abusive language  towards Samuel H. Smith; also for abusing the marshal of the city, I  spent the day in council, and such was the proof against Foster, I had  considerable labor to get him clear, even after his confession, which I  desired to do, hoping he would amend.    _Saturday, 21_.--I spent the day with the High Council of Nauvoo,  investigating the case of Robert D. Foster, Chauncey L. Higbee and  others.    _Sunday, 22_.--I spent the day mostly at home. In looking at the  papers, I discovered the following in the Quincy _Whig_:        ASSASSINATION OF EX-GOVERNOR BOGGS OF MISSOURI.        Lilburn W. Boggs, late governor of Missouri, was assassinated at      his residence in Independence, Missouri, by an unknown hand, on the      6th instant. He was sitting in a room by himself, when some person      discharged a pistol loaded with buckshot, through an adjoining      window, three of the shots took effect in his head, one of which      penetrated the brain. His son, a boy, hearing the report of the      pistol, ran into the room in which his father was seated, and      found him in a helpless situation, upon which he gave the alarm.      Footprints were found beneath the window, and the pistol which      gave the fatal shot. The governor was alive on the seventh, but      no hopes are entertained of his recovery. A man was suspected,      and is probably arrested before this. There are several rumors in      circulation in regard to the horrid affair; one of which throws the      crime upon the Mormons, from the fact, we suppose, that Mr. Boggs      was governor at the time, and in no small degree instrumental in      driving them from the state. Smith, too, the Mormon Prophet, as we      understand, prophesied, a year or so ago, his death by {15} violent      means. Hence, there is plenty of foundation for rumor. The citizens      of Independence had offered a reward of $500 for the murderer.    I went to the editor's office, and inserted the following in the _Wasp_:        NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, MAY 22, 1842.        _Mr. Bartlett_:        DEAR SIR:--In your paper (the _Quincy Whig_) of the 21st instant,      you have done me manifest injustice in ascribing to me a prediction      of the demise of Lilburn W. Boggs, Esq., ex-governor of Missouri,      by violent hands. Boggs was a candidate for the state senate,      and, I presume, fell by the hand of a political opponent, with      \"his hands and face yet dripping with the blood of murder;\" but      he died not through my instrumentality. My hands are clean, and      my heart pure, from the blood of all men. I am tired of the      misrepresentation, calumny and detraction, heaped upon me by wicked      men; and desire and claim, only those principles guaranteed to      all men by the Constitution and laws of the United States and of      Illinois. Will you do me the justice to publish this communication?      and oblige,        Yours respectfully,        [Signed] JOSEPH SMITH.    _An Epistle of the High Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo, to the Saints scattered abroad, Greeting_:        DEAR BRETHREN:--Inasmuch as the Lord hath spoken, and the      commandment hath gone forth for the gathering together of His      people from Babylon, that \"they partake not of her sins, and      receive not of her plagues;\" it seemeth, \"good unto us, and also to      the Holy Ghost\" to write somewhat for your instruction, in obeying      that commandment.
