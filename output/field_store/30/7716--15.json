He saw, too, other grotesque, manlike forms.  They were of Terkoz, Tublat, Kerchak, and a smaller, less ferocious  figure, that was Neeta, the little playmate of his boyhood.    Slowly, very slowly, as these visions of the past animated his  lethargic memory, he came to recognize them.  They took definite shape  and form, adjusting themselves nicely to the various incidents of his  life with which they had been intimately connected.  His boyhood among  the apes spread itself in a slow panorama before him, and as it  unfolded it induced within him a mighty longing for the companionship  of the shaggy, low-browed brutes of his past.    He watched the blacks scatter their cook fire and depart; but though  the face of each of them had but recently been as familiar to him as  his own, they awakened within him no recollections whatsoever.    When they had gone, he descended from the tree and sought food.  Out  upon the plain grazed numerous herds of wild ruminants.  Toward a  sleek, fat bunch of zebra he wormed his stealthy way.  No intricate  process of reasoning caused him to circle widely until he was down wind  from his prey--he acted instinctively.  He took advantage of every form  of cover as he crawled upon all fours and often flat upon his stomach  toward them.    A plump young mare and a fat stallion grazed nearest to him as he  neared the herd.  Again it was instinct which selected the former for  his meat.  A low bush grew but a few yards from the unsuspecting two.  The ape-man reached its shelter.  He gathered his spear firmly in his  grasp.  Cautiously he drew his feet beneath him.  In a single swift  move he rose and cast his heavy weapon at the mare's side.  Nor did he  wait to note the effect of his assault, but leaped cat-like after his  spear, his hunting knife in his hand.    For an instant the two animals stood motionless.  The tearing of the  cruel barb into her side brought a sudden scream of pain and fright  from the mare, and then they both wheeled and broke for safety; but  Tarzan of the Apes, for a distance of a few yards, could equal the  speed of even these, and the first stride of the mare found her  overhauled, with a savage beast at her shoulder.  She turned, biting  and kicking at her foe.  Her mate hesitated for an instant, as though  about to rush to her assistance; but a backward glance revealed to him  the flying heels of the balance of the herd, and with a snort and a  shake of his head he wheeled and dashed away.    Clinging with one hand to the short mane of his quarry, Tarzan struck  again and again with his knife at the unprotected heart.  The result  had, from the first, been inevitable.  The mare fought bravely, but  hopelessly, and presently sank to the earth, her heart pierced.  The  ape-man placed a foot upon her carcass and raised his voice in the  victory call of the Mangani.  In the distance, Basuli halted as the  faint notes of the hideous scream broke upon his ears.    \"The great apes,\" he said to his companion.  \"It has been long since I  have heard them in the country of the Waziri.  What could have brought  them back?\"    Tarzan grasped his kill and dragged it to the partial seclusion of the  bush which had hidden his own near approach, and there he squatted upon  it, cut a huge hunk of flesh from the loin and proceeded to satisfy his  hunger with the warm and dripping meat.    Attracted by the shrill screams of the mare, a pair of hyenas slunk  presently into view.  They trotted to a point a few yards from the  gorging ape-man, and halted.  Tarzan looked up, bared his fighting  fangs and growled.  The hyenas returned the compliment, and withdrew a  couple of paces.  They made no move to attack; but continued to sit at  a respectful distance until Tarzan had concluded his meal.  After the  ape-man had cut a few strips from the carcass to carry with him, he  walked slowly off in the direction of the river to quench his thirst.  His way lay directly toward the hyenas, nor did he alter his course  because of them.    With all the lordly majesty of Numa, the lion, he strode straight  toward the growling beasts.  For a moment they held their ground,  bristling and defiant; but only for a moment, and then slunk away to  one side while the indifferent ape-man passed them on his lordly way.  A moment later they were tearing at the remains of the zebra.    Back to the reeds went Tarzan, and through them toward the river.  A  herd of buffalo, startled by his approach, rose ready to charge or to  fly.  A great bull pawed the ground and bellowed as his bloodshot eyes  discovered the intruder; but the ape-man passed across their front as  though ignorant of their existence.  The bull's bellowing lessened to a  low rumbling, he turned and scraped a horde of flies from his side with  his muzzle, cast a final glance at the ape-man and resumed his feeding.  His numerous family either followed his example or stood gazing after  Tarzan in mild-eyed curiosity, until the opposite reeds swallowed him  from view.    At the river, Tarzan drank his fill and bathed.  During the heat of the  day he lay up under the shade of a tree near the ruins of his burned  barns.  His eyes wandered out across the plain toward the forest, and a  longing for the pleasures of its mysterious depths possessed his  thoughts for a considerable time.  With the next sun he would cross the  open and enter the forest!  There was no hurry--there lay before him an  endless vista of tomorrows with naught to fill them but the satisfying  of the appetites and caprices of the moment.    The ape-man's mind was untroubled by regret for the past, or aspiration  for the future.  He could lie at full length along a swaying branch,  stretching his giant limbs, and luxuriating in the blessed peace of  utter thoughtlessness, without an apprehension or a worry to sap his  nervous energy and rob him of his peace of mind.  Recalling only dimly  any other existence, the ape-man was happy.  Lord Greystoke had ceased  to exist.    For several hours Tarzan lolled upon his swaying, leafy couch until  once again hunger and thirst suggested an excursion.  Stretching lazily  he dropped to the ground and moved slowly toward the river.  The game  trail down which he walked had become by ages of use a deep, narrow  trench, its walls topped on either side by impenetrable thicket and  dense-growing trees closely interwoven with thick-stemmed creepers and  lesser vines inextricably matted into two solid ramparts of vegetation.  Tarzan had almost reached the point where the trail debouched upon the  open river bottom when he saw a family of lions approaching along the  path from the direction of the river.  The ape-man counted seven--a  male and two lionesses, full grown, and four young lions as large and  quite as formidable as their parents.  Tarzan halted, growling, and the  lions paused, the great male in the lead baring his fangs and rumbling  forth a warning roar.  In his hand the ape-man held his heavy spear;  but he had no intention of pitting his puny weapon against seven lions;  yet he stood there growling and roaring and the lions did likewise.  It  was purely an exhibition of jungle bluff.  Each was trying to frighten  off the other.  Neither wished to turn back and give way, nor did  either at first desire to precipitate an encounter.  The lions were fed  sufficiently so as not to be goaded by pangs of hunger and as for  Tarzan he seldom ate the meat of the carnivores; but a point of ethics  was at stake and neither side wished to back down.  So they stood there  facing one another, making all sorts of hideous noises the while they  hurled jungle invective back and forth.  How long this bloodless duel  would have persisted it is difficult to say, though eventually Tarzan  would have been forced to yield to superior numbers.    There came, however, an interruption which put an end to the deadlock  and it came from Tarzan's rear.  He and the lions had been making so  much noise that neither could hear anything above their concerted  bedlam, and so it was that Tarzan did not hear the great bulk bearing  down upon him from behind until an instant before it was upon him, and  then he turned to see Buto, the rhinoceros, his little, pig eyes  blazing, charging madly toward him and already so close that escape  seemed impossible; yet so perfectly were mind and muscles coordinated  in this unspoiled, primitive man that almost simultaneously with the  sense perception of the threatened danger he wheeled and hurled his  spear at Buto's chest.  It was a heavy spear shod with iron, and behind  it were the giant muscles of the ape-man, while coming to meet it was  the enormous weight of Buto and the momentum of his rapid rush.  All  that happened in the instant that Tarzan turned to meet the charge of  the irascible rhinoceros might take long to tell, and yet would have  taxed the swiftest lens to record.  As his spear left his hand the  ape-man was looking down upon the mighty horn lowered to toss him, so  close was Buto to him.  The spear entered the rhinoceros' neck at its  junction with the left shoulder and passed almost entirely through the  beast's body, and at the instant that he launched it, Tarzan leaped  straight into the air alighting upon Buto's back but escaping the  mighty horn.    Then Buto espied the lions and bore madly down upon them while Tarzan  of the Apes leaped nimbly into the tangled creepers at one side of the  trail.  The first lion met Buto's charge and was tossed high over the  back of the maddened brute, torn and dying, and then the six remaining  lions were upon the rhinoceros, rending and tearing the while they were  being gored or trampled.  From the safety of his perch Tarzan watched  the royal battle with the keenest interest, for the more intelligent of  the jungle folk are interested in such encounters.
