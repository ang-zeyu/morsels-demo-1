The  expedition of Berrio which had increased in number during the stay of  the vessels at Cumana, La Margareta, and the island of Trinidad,  proceeded by Morequito (near Vieja Guayana) towards the Rio Paragua, a  tributary stream of the Carony; but sickness, the ferocity of the  natives, and the want of subsistence, opposed invincible obstacles to  the progress of the Spaniards. They all perished; except about thirty,  who returned in a deplorable state to the post of Santo Thome.    These disasters did not calm the ardour displayed during the first  half of the 17th century in the search of El Dorado. The Governor of  the island of Trinidad, Antonio de Berrio, became the prisoner of Sir  Walter Raleigh in the celebrated incursion of that navigator, in 1595,  on the coast of Venezuela and at the mouths of the Orinoco. Raleigh  collected from Berrio, and from other prisoners made by Captain  Preston* at the taking of Caracas, all the information which had been  obtained at that period on the countries situate to the south of Vieya  Guayana. (* These prisoners belonged to the expedition of Berrio and  of Hernandez de Serpa. The English landed at Macuto (then Guayca  Macuto), whence a white man, Villalpando, led them by a mountain-path  between Cumbre and the Silla (perhaps passing over the ridge of  Galipano) to the town of Caracas. Simon page 594; Raleigh page 19.  Those only who are acquainted with the situation can be sensible how  difficult and daring this enterprise was.) He lent faith to the fables  invented by Juan Martin de Albujar, and entertained no doubt either of  the existence of the two lakes Cassipa and Rupunuwini, or of that of  the great empire of the Inca, which, after the death of Atahualpa, the  fugitive princes were supposed to have founded near the sources of the  Essequibo. We are not in possession of a map that was constructed by  Raleigh, and which he recommended to lord Charles Howard to keep  secret. The geographer Hondius has filled up this void; and has even  added to his map a table of longitudes and latitudes, among which  figure the laguna del Dorado, and the Ville Imperiale de Manoas.  Raleigh, when at anchor near the Punta del Gallo* in the island of  Trinidad (* The northern part of La Punta de Icacos, which is the  south-east cape of the island of Trinidad. Christopher Columbus cast  anchor there on August 3, 1498. A great confusion exists in the  denomination of the different capes of the island of Trinidad; and as  recently, since the expedition of Fidalgo and Churruca, the Spaniards  reckon the longitudes in South America west of La Punta de la Galera  (latitude 10 degrees 50 minutes, longitude 63 degrees 20 minutes), it  is important to fix the attention of geographers on this point.  Columbus called the south-east cape of the island Punta Galera, on  account of the form of a rock. From Punta de la Galera he sailed to  the west and landed at a low cape, which he calls Punta del Arenal;  this is our Punta de Icacos. In this passage, near a place (Punta de  la Playa) where he stopped to take in water (perhaps at the mouth of  the Rio Erin), he saw to the south, for the first time, the continent  of America, which he called Isla Santa. It was, therefore, the eastern  coast of the province of Cumana, to the east of the Cano Macareo, near  Punta Redonda, and not the mountainous coast of Paria (Isla de Gracia,  of Columbus), which was first discovered.), made his lieutenants  explore the mouths of the Orinoco, principally those of Capuri, Grand  Amana (Manamo Grande), and Macureo (Macareo). As his ships drew a  great deal of water, he found it difficult to enter the bocas chicas,  and was obliged to construct flat-bottomed barks. He remarked the  fires of the Tivitivas (Tibitibies), of the race of the Guaraon  Indians, on the tops of the mauritia palm-trees; and appears to have  first brought the fruit to Europe (fructum squamosum, similem palmae  pini). I am surprised, that he scarcely mentions the settlement, which  had been made by Berrio under the name of Santo Thome (la Vieja  Guayana.) This settlement however dates from 1591; and though,  according to Fray Pedro Simon, \"religion and policy prohibited all  mercantile connection between Christians [Spaniards] and Heretics [the  Dutch and English],\" there was then carried on at the end of the  sixteenth century, as in our days, an active contraband trade by the  mouths of the Orinoco. Raleigh passed the river Europa (Guarapo), and  \"the plains of Saymas (Chaymas), which extend, keeping the same level,  as far as Cumana and Caracas;\" he stopped at Morequito (perhaps a  little to the north of the site of the villa de Upata, in the missions  of the Carony), where an old cacique confirmed to him all the reveries  of Berrio on the irruption of foreign nations (Orejones and Epuremei)  into Guiana. The Raudales or cataracts of the Caroli (Carony), a river  which was at that period considered as the shortest way for reaching  the towns of Macureguarai and Manoa, situate on the banks of lake  Cassipa and of lake Rupunuwini or Dorado, put an end to this  expedition.    Raleigh went scarcely the distance of sixty leagues along the Orinoco;  but he names the upper tributary streams, according to the vague  notions he had collected; the Cari, the Pao, the Apure (Capuri?) the  Guarico (Voari?) the Meta,* and even, \"in the province of Baraguan,  the great cataract of Athule (Atures), which prevents all further  navigation.\" (* Raleigh distinguishes the Meta from the Beta, which  flows into the Baraguan (the Orinoco) conjointly with the Daune, near  Athule; as he distinguishes the Casanare, a tributary stream of the  Meta, and the Casnero, which comes from the south, and appears to be  the Rio Cuchivero. All above the confluence of the Apure was then very  confusedly known; and streams that flow into the tributary streams of  the Orinoco were considered as flowing into this river itself. The  Apure (Capuri) and Meta appeared long to be the same river on account  of their proximity, and the numerous branches by which the Arauca and  the Apure join each other. Is the name of Beta perchance connected  with that of the nation of Betoyes, of the plains of the Casanare and  the Meta? Hondius and the geographers who have followed him, with the  exception of De L'Isle (1700), and of Sanson (1656), place the  province of Amapaja erroneously to the east of the Orinoco. We see  clearly by the narrative of Raleigh (pages 26 and 72), that Amapaja is  the inundated country between the Meta and the Guarico. Where are the  rivers Dauney and Ubarro? The Guaviare appears to me to be the Goavar  of Raleigh.) Notwithstanding Raleigh's exaggeration, so little worthy  of a statesman, his narrative contains important materials for the  history of geography. The Orinoco above the confluence of the Apure  was at that period as little known to Europeans, as in our time the  course of the Niger below Sego. The names of several very remote  tributary streams were known, but not their situation; and when the  same name, differently pronounced, or not properly apprehended by the  ear, furnished different sounds, their number was multiplied. Other  errors had perhaps their source in the little interest which Antonio  de Berrio, the Spanish governor, felt in communicating true and  precise notions to Raleigh, who indeed complains of his prisoner, \"as  being utterly unlearned, and not knowing the east from the west.\" I  shall not here discuss the point how far the belief of Raleigh, in all  he relates of inland seas similar to the Caspian sea; on \"the imperial  and golden city of Manoa,\" and on the magnificent palaces built by the  emperor Inga of Guyana, in imitation of those of his ancestors at  Peru, was real or pretended. The learned historian of Brazil, Mr.  Southey, and the biographer of Raleigh, Sir G. Cayley, have recently  thrown much light on this subject. It seems to me difficult to doubt  of the extreme credulity of the chief of the expedition, and of his  lieutenants. We see Raleigh adapted everything to the hypotheses he  had previously formed. He was certainly deceived himself; but when he  sought to influence the imagination of queen Elizabeth, and execute  the projects of his own ambitious policy, he neglected none of the  artifices of flattery. He described to the Queen \"the transports of  those barbarous nations at the sight of her picture;\" he would have  \"the name of the august virgin, who knows how to conquer empires,  reach as far as the country of the warlike women of the Orinoco and  the Amazon;\" he asserts that \"at the period when the Spaniards  overthrew the throne of Cuzco, an ancient prophecy was found, which  predicted that the dynasty of the Incas would one day owe its  restoration to Great Britain;\" he advises that \"on pretext of  defending the territory against external enemies, garrisons of three  or four thousand English should be placed in the towns of the Inca,  obliging this prince to pay a contribution annually to Queen Elizabeth  of three hundred thousand pounds sterling;\" finally he adds, like a  man who foresees the future, that \"all the vast countries of South  America will one day belong to the English nation.\"* (* \"I showed them  her Majesty's picture, which the Casigui so admired and honoured, as  it had been easy to have brought them idolatrous thereof. And I  further remember that Berreo confessed to me and others (which I  protest before the majesty of God to be true), that there was found  among prophecies at Peru (at such a time as the empire was reduced to  the Spanish obedience) in their chiefest temple, among divers others  which foreshowed the losse of the said empyre, that from Inglatierra  those Ingas should be again in time to come restored.

Analogously to the lamp, the Self is essentially intelligent (kid-rûpa),  and has intelligence (kaitanya) for its quality. And to be essentially  intelligent means to be self-luminous. There are many scriptural texts  declaring this, compare e.g. 'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor  outside but is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed that Self has  neither inside nor outside but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (Bri.  Up. IV, 5, 13); 'There that person becomes self-luminous, there is no  destruction of the knowing of the knower' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 14; 30); 'He  who knows, let me smell this, he is the Self (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 4); 'Who  is that Self? That one who is made of knowledge, among the prânas,  within the heart, the light, the person' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 7); 'For it is  he who sees, hears, smells, tastes, thinks, considers, acts, the person  whose Self is knowledge' (Pr. Up. IV, 9); 'Whereby should one know the  knower' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15). 'This person knows,' 'The seer does not  see death nor illness nor pain' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2); 'That highest  person not remembering this body into which he was born' (Ch. Up. VIII,  12, 3); 'Thus these sixteen parts of the spectator that go towards the  person; when they have readied the person, sink into him' (Pr. Up. VI,  5); 'From this consisting of mind, there is different an interior Self  consisting of knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 4). And the Sûtrakâra also will  refer to the Self as a 'knower' in II, 3, 18. All which shows that the  self-luminous Self is a knower, i.e. a knowing subject, and not pure  light (non-personal intelligence). In general we may say that where  there is light it must belong to something, as shown by the light of a  lamp. The Self thus cannot be mere consciousness. The grammarians  moreover tell us that words such as 'consciousness,' 'knowledge,' &c.,  are relative; neither ordinary nor Vedic language uses expressions such  as 'he knows' without reference to an object known and an agent who  knows.    With reference to the assertion that consciousness constitutes the Self,  because it (consciousness) is not non-intelligent (jada), we ask what  you understand by this absence of non-intelligence.' If you reply  'luminousness due to the being of the thing itself (i.e. of the thing  which is ajada)'; we point out that this definition would wrongly  include lamps also, and similar things; and it would moreover give rise  to a contradiction, since you do not admit light as an attribute,  different from consciousness itself. Nor can we allow you to define  ajadatva as 'being of that nature that light is always present, without  any exception,' for this definition would extend also to pleasure, pain,  and similar states. Should you maintain that pleasure and so on,  although being throughout of the nature of light, are non-intelligent  for the reason that, like jars, &c., they shine forth (appear) to  something else and hence belong to the sphere of the not-Self; we ask in  reply: Do you mean then to say that knowledge appears to itself?  Knowledge no less than pleasure appears to some one else, viz. the 'I':  there is, in that respect, no difference between the judgment 'I know,'  and the judgment 'I am pleased.' Non-intelligence in the sense of  appearingness-to-itself is thus not proved for consciousness; and hence  it follows that what constitutes the Self is the non-jada 'I' which is  proved to itself by its very Being. That knowledge is of the nature of  light depends altogether on its connection with the knowing 'I': it is  due to the latter, that knowledge, like pleasure, manifests itself to  that conscious person who is its substrate, and not to anybody else. The  Self is thus not mere knowledge, but is the knowing 'I.'          The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the  ahamkâra, cannot be maintained.    We turn to a further point. You maintain that consciousness which is in  reality devoid alike of objects and substrate presents itself, owing to  error, in the form of a knowing subject, just as mother o' pearl appears  as silver; (consciousness itself being viewed as a real substrate of an  erroneous imputation), because an erroneous imputation cannot take place  apart from a substrate. But this theory is indefensible. If things were  as you describe them, the conscious 'I' would be cognised as co-ordinate  with the state of consciousness 'I am consciousness,' just as the  shining thing presenting itself to our eyes is judged to be silver. But  the fact is that the state of consciousness presents itself as something  apart, constituting a distinguishing attribute of the I, just as the  stick is an attribute of Devadatta who carries it. The judgment 'I am  conscious' reveals an 'I' distinguished by consciousness; and to declare  that it refers only to a state of consciousness--which is a mere  attribute--is no better than to say that the judgment 'Devadatta carries  a stick' is about the stick only. Nor are you right in saying that the  idea of the Self being a knowing agent, presents itself to the mind of  him only who erroneously identifies the Self and the body, an error  expressing itself in judgments such as 'I am stout,' and is on that  account false; for from this it would follow that the consciousness  which is erroneously imagined as a Self is also false; for it presents  itself to the mind of the same person. You will perhaps rejoin that  consciousness is not false because it (alone) is not sublatcd by that  cognition which sublates everything else. Well, we reply, then the  knowership of the Self also is not false; for that also is not sublatcd.  You further maintain that the character of being a knower, i.e. the  agent in the action of knowing, does not become the non-changing Self;  that being a knower is something implying change, of a non-intelligent  kind (jada), and residing in the ahamkâra which is the abode of change  and a mere effect of the Unevolved (the Prakriti); that being an agent  and so on is like colour and other qualities, an attribute of what is  objective; and that if we admit the Self to be an agent and the object  of the notion of the 'I,' it also follows that the Self is, like the  body, not a real Self but something external and non-intelligent. But  all this is unfounded, since the internal organ is, like the body,  non-intelligent, an effect of Prakriti, an object of knowledge,  something outward and for the sake of others merely; while being a  knowing subject constitutes the special essential nature of intelligent  beings. To explain. Just as the body, through its objectiveness,  outwardness, and similar causes, is distinguished from what possesses  the opposite attributes of subjectiveness, inwardness, and so on; for  the same reason the ahamkâra also--which is of the same substantial  nature as the body--is similarly distinguished. Hence the ahamkâra is  no more a knower than it is something subjective; otherwise there would  be an evident contradiction. As knowing cannot be attributed to the  ahamkâra, which is an object of knowledge, so knowership also cannot be  ascribed to it; for of that also it is the object. Nor can it be  maintained that to be a knower is something essentially changing. For to  be a knower is to be the substrate of the quality of knowledge, and as  the knowing Self is eternal, knowledge which is an essential quality of  the Self is also eternal. That the Self is eternal will be declared in  the Sûtra, II, 3, 17; and in II, 3, 18 the term 'jña' (knower) will show  that it is an essential quality of the Self to be the abode of  knowledge. That a Self whose essential nature is knowledge should be the  substrate of the (quality of) knowledge--just as gems and the like are  the substrate of light--gives rise to no contradiction whatever.    Knowledge (the quality) which is in itself unlimited, is capable of  contraction and expansion, as we shall show later on. In the so-called  kshetrajña--condition of the Self, knowledge is, owing to the influence  of work (karman), of a contracted nature, as it more or less adapts  itself to work of different kinds, and is variously determined by the  different senses. With reference to this various flow of knowledge as  due to the senses, it is spoken of as rising and setting, and the Self  possesses the quality of an agent. As this quality is not, however,  essential, but originated by action, the Self is essentially unchanging.  This changeful quality of being a knower can belong only to the Self  whose essential nature is knowledge; not possibly to the non-intelligent  ahamkâra. But, you will perhaps say, the ahamkâra, although of non-  intelligent nature, may become a knower in so far as by approximation to  intelligence it becomes a reflection of the latter. How, we ask in  return, is this becoming a reflection of intelligence imagined to take  place? Does consciousness become a reflection of the ahamkâra, or does  the ahamkâra become a reflection of consciousness? The former  alternative is inadmissible, since you will not allow to consciousness  the quality of being a knower; and so is the latter since, as explained  above, the non-intelligent ahamkâra can never become a knower. Moreover,  neither consciousness nor the ahamkâra are objects of visual perception.  Only things seen by the eye have reflections.--Let it then be said that  as an iron ball is heated by contact with fire, so the consciousness of  being a knower is imparted to the ahamkâra through its contact with  Intelligence.--This view too is inadmissible; for as you do not allow  real knowership to Intelligence, knowership or the consciousness of  knowership cannot be imparted to the ahamkâra by contact with  Intelligence; and much less even can knowership or the consciousness of  it be imparted to Intelligence by contact with the essentially non-  intelligent ahamkâra.
