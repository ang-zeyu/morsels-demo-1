Then he looked the party over  carefully and said:    \"If the Pumpkinhead is to ride, why not use one of his legs to make a leg  for the horse that carries him? I judge that both are made of wood.\"    \"Now, that is what I call real cleverness,\" said the Scarecrow, approvingly.  \"I wonder my brains  did not think of that long ago! Get to work, my dear  Nick, and fit the Pumpkinhead's leg to the Saw-Horse.\"    Jack was not especially pleased with this idea; but he submitted to having  his left leg amputated by the Tin Woodman and whittled down to fit the left  leg of the Saw-Horse. Nor was the Saw-Horse especially pleased with the  operation, either; for he growled a good deal about being \"butchered,\" as he  called it, and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a  respectable Saw-Horse.    \"I beg you to be more careful in your speech,\" said the Pumpkinhead,  sharply. \"Remember, if you please, that it is my leg you are abusing.\"    \"I cannot forget it,\" retorted the Saw-Horse, \"for it is quite as flimsy as  the rest of your person.\"    \"Flimsy! me flimsy!\" cried Jack, in a rage. \"How dare you call me flimsy?\"    \"Because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-        157  jack,\" sneered the horse, rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner. \"Even  your head won't stay straight, and you never can tell whether you are  looking backwards or forwards!\"    \"Friends, I entreat you not to quarrel!\" pleaded the Tin Woodman,  anxiously.\" As a matter of fact, we are none of us above criticism; so let  us bear with each others' faults.\"    \"An excellent suggestion,\" said the Woggle-Bug, approvingly. \"You must have  an excellent heart, my metallic friend.\"    \"I have,\" returned Nick, well pleased. \"My heart is quite the best part of  me. But now let us start upon our Journey.    They perched the one-legged Pumpkinhead upon the Saw-Horse, and tied him to  his seat with cords, so that he could not possibly fall off.    And then, following the lead of the Scarecrow, they all advanced in the  direction of the Emerald City.

So they were obliged to halt while the Tin Woodman chopped it down  with his axe, after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably. But  the Saw-Horse was not entirely satisfied, even yet.    \"It was a shame that I broke my other leg!\" it growled.    \"On the contrary,\" airily remarked the Woggle-Bug, who was walking  alongside, \"you should consider the accident most fortunate. For a horse is  never of much use until he has been broken.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Tip, rather provoked, for he felt a warm interest  in both the Saw-Horse and his man Jack; \"but permit me to say that your joke  is a poor one, and as old as it is poor.\"        160    \"Still, it is a Joke,\" declared the Woggle-Bug; firmly, \"and a Joke derived  from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently  proper.\"    \"What does that mean?\" enquired the Pumpkinhead, stupidly.    \"It means, my dear friend,\" explained the Woggle-Bug, \"that our language  contains many words having a double meaning; and that to pronounce a joke  that allows both meanings of a certain word, proves the joker a person of  culture and refinement, who has, moreover, a thorough command of the  language.\"    \"I don't believe that,\" said Tip, plainly; \"anybody can make a pun.\"    \"Not so,\" rejoined the Woggle-Bug, stiffly. \"It requires education of a high  order. Are you educated, young sir?\"    \"Not especially,\" admitted Tip.    \"Then you cannot judge the matter. I myself am Thoroughly Educated, and I  say that puns display genius. For instance, were I to ride upon this Saw-  Horse, he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage. For he  would then be a horse-and-buggy.\"    At this the Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin        161  Woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the Woggle-Bug. At the  same time the Saw-Horse loudly snorted his derision; and even the  Pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which, because it was carved  upon his face, he could not change to a frown.    But the Woggle-Bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark,  and the Scarecrow was obliged to say:    \"I have heard, my dear friend, that a person can become over-educated; and  although I have a high respect for brains, no matter how they may be  arranged or classified, I begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled.  In any event, I must beg you to restrain your superior education while in  our society.\"    \"We are not very particular,\" added the Tin Woodman; \"and we are exceedingly  kind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky again--\" He did not  complete the sentence, but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that  the Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank away to a safe distance.    The others marched on in silence, and the Highly Magnified one, after a  period of deep thought, said in an humble voice:    \"I will endeavor to restrain myself.\"        162    \"That is all we can expect,\" returned the Scarecrow pleasantly; and good  nature being thus happily restored to the party, they proceeded upon their  way.    When they again stopped to allow Tip to rest--the boy being the only one  that seemed to tire--the Tin Woodman noticed many small, round holes in  the grassy meadow.    \"This must be a village of the Field Mice,\" he said to the Scarecrow.\" I  wonder if my old friend, the Queen of the Mice, is in this neighborhood.\"    \"If she is, she may be of great service to us,\" answered the Scarecrow, who  was impressed by a sudden thought. \"See if you can call her, my dear Nick.\"    So the Tin Woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around  his neck, and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by hole and  advanced fearlessly toward them. For the Tin Woodman had once saved her  life, and the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be trusted.\"    \"Good day, your Majesty, said Nick, politely addressing the mouse; \"I trust  you are enjoying good health?\"    \"Thank you, I am quite well,\" answered the Queen, demurely, as she sat up  and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head. \"Can I do anything to  assist my old friends?\"        163    \"You can, indeed,\" replied the Scarecrow, eagerly. \"Let me, I intreat you,  take a dozen of your subjects with me to the Emerald City.\"    \"Will they be injured in any way?\" asked the Queen, doubtfully.    \"I think not,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"I will carry them hidden in the straw  which stuffs my body, and when I give them the signal by unbuttoning my  jacket, they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they  can. By doing this they will assist me to regain my throne, which the Army  of Revolt has taken from me.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Queen, \"I will not refuse your request. Whenever  you are ready, I will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects.\"    \"I am ready now\" returned the Scarecrow. Then he lay flat upon the ground  and unbuttoned his jacket, displaying the mass of straw with which he was  stuffed.    The Queen uttered a little piping call, and in an instant a dozen pretty  field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler,  awaiting her orders.    What the Queen said to them none of our travelers could understand, for it  was in the mouse language; but the field mice obeyed without hesitation,        164  running one after the other to the Scarecrow and hiding themselves in the  straw of his breast.    When all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves, the Scarecrow  buttoned his Jacket securely and then arose and thanked the Queen for her  kindness.    \"One thing more you might do to serve us,\" suggested the Tin Woodman; \"and  that is to run ahead and show us the way to the Emerald City. For some enemy  is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it.\"    \"I will do that gladly,\" returned the Queen. \"Are you ready?\"    The Tin Woodman looked at Tip.    \"I'm rested,\" said the boy. \"Let us start.\"    Then they resumed their journey, the little grey  Queen of the Field Mice  running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near, when  away she would dart again.    Without this unerring guide the Scarecrow and his comrades might never have  gained the Emerald City; for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by  the arts of old Mombi. Yet not one of the obstacles really existed--all  were cleverly contrived deceptions. For when they came to the banks of a  rushing river that threatened to bar their way the        165  little Queen kept steadily on, passing through the seeming flood in safety;  and our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water.    Again, a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed  their advance. But the grey Field Mouse walked straight through it, and the  others did the same, the wall melting into mist as they passed it.    Afterward, when they had stopped for a moment to allow Tip to rest, they saw  forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions; and  soon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel, first in  one direction and then in the other, completely bewildering their vision.    But the Queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight  line; and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and  were seen no more.    Mombi's last trick was the most fearful of all. She sent a sheet of  crackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them; and for the first  time the Scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#14)"],[1,"before dinner: so called    from its damping, or allaying, the appetite; eating and    drinking, being, as the proverb wisely observes, apt to take    away the appetite.

One day David's wife having    taken a cup too much, and being fearful of the    consequences, turned out the sow, and lay down to sleep herself    sober in the stye. A company coming in to see the sow,    David ushered them into the stye, exclaiming, there is a    sow for you! did any of you ever see such another? all    the while supposing the sow had really been there; to    which some of the company, seeing the state the woman    was in, replied, it was the drunkenest sow they had ever    beheld; whence the woman was ever after called David's    sow.

The Devil himself; a small    streak of blue thread in the king's sails.

To hold a candle to the Devil; to    be civil to any one out of fear: in allusion to the story of    the old woman, who set a wax taper before the image of    St. Michael, and another before the Devil, whom that    saint is commonly represented as trampling under his feet:    being reproved for paying such honour to Satan, she answered,    as it was uncertain which place she should go    to, heaven or hell, she chose to secure a friend in both    places.
