Such revelations have been revealed unto  the Church in the Temples of the Lord; but I shall _not_ name them.  If the Lord saw fit to keep them from the world, yes, and from the  dispensations past, He does not intend to reveal them to the world  _now_; neither to the scoffer and the unbeliever in His works. Let our  friend read Matthew 7:10-12, as it is given in the Holy Scriptures:  \"_And the mysteries of the kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves_;  for it is not meet to give that which is holy unto the dogs; neither  cast ye your pearls unto swine, lest they trample them under their  feet. For the world cannot receive that which ye, yourselves, are not  able to bear; wherefore ye shall not give your pearls unto them, lest  they turn again and rend you.\"        Succession in the Presidency of the Church.    * * * * *    An Address Delivered in the Weber Stake Tabernacle, Ogden, Sunday,  April 28, 1907, by Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.    * * * * *    A short time ago I was invited to address the Saints from this stand  on the subject of \"The Origin of the Reorganized Church.\" It has been  thought by some that it would be wise to continue the subject and  therefore I have been invited to address you this afternoon on the  question of Succession in the Presidency of the Church. In doing so, I  desire it to be understood that I have no feeling of animosity towards  those of a different faith; but so much has been said on the other  side of this question, and so little in our defense, that I feel it  important to deal with this subject.    The testimony on which members of the so-called \"Reorganized\" Church  base their contention that Joseph, son of the Prophet Joseph Smith,  should have succeeded his father in the Presidency of the Church is as  follows:    1. That it is his right by the law of lineage--that the office of  president of the High Priesthood descends from father to the first born  son.    2. That it is his right by appointment of his father.    3. That he was properly ordained by those holding the authority to  preach and administer in the ordinances of the gospel.    We shall take these questions up and consider them and will refer to  the passages in the Doctrine and Covenants that are used by these  people, together with other passages that they do not use, and we will  see just how much there is in them in support of their position.    We will first consider the statement that the Prophet was to choose  his successor. The passages referred to in support of this are in  the Doctrine and Covenants as follows: Sections 28:6-7, 35:18, and  43:2-5. These I shall read to you. I cannot stop now to explain the  circumstances under which these revelations were given, and take it for  granted that you will consider that matter for yourselves. The first of  these was given to Oliver Cowdery and I read, beginning with the 4th  verse:        \"And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter, to speak or      teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the Church,      thou mayest do it. But thou shalt not write by way of commandment,      but by wisdom; and thou shalt not command him who is at thy head,      and at the head of the Church, for I have given him the keys of      the mysteries, and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall      appoint unto them another in his stead.\"    You see, the Lord was to appoint another.    The passage in section 35 is as follows:        \"And I have sent forth the fulnesss of my Gospel by the hand of      my servant Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him, and I have      given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have      been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the      world, and the things which shall come from this time until the      time of my coming, IF HE ABIDE IN ME, AND IF NOT, ANOTHER WILL I      PLANT IN HIS STEAD. Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail      not, and it shall be given by the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, that      knoweth all things.\"    The third passage is as follows, beginning with the first verse:        \"O hearken, ye Elders of my Church, and give an ear to the word      which I shall speak unto you; for behold verily, verily, I say unto      you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my Church,      through him whom I have appointed unto you, to receive commandments      and revelations from my hand.        \"And this ye shall know assuredly that there is none other      appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until      he be taken, if he abide in me. But verily, verily, I say unto      you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be      through him, FOR IF IT BE TAKEN FROM HIM, he shall not have power      except to appoint another in his stead; and this shall be a law      unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come      before you as revelations or commandments; and this I give unto you      that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.\"    These revelations, extracts from which I have read, were all given  between September, 1830, and the first of March, 1831. At that time  the Church was less than one year old, and was not fully organized  with its various officers as we have it today. The quorums of Apostles  and Seventies were not called till 1835--over four years subsequent to  these revelations. When they were given the Prophet Joseph was young  and inexperienced, and this law was laid down for the government of  the Church as it existed at that time, as these revelations clearly  indicate. You will notice from these passages, that the Lord was to  choose another in the Prophet's stead in case of his removal through  transgression, or for any other cause, during that incipient stage of  the history of the Church. It was necessary at that time that some  provision be made for the perpetuity of the prophetic office, in case  that Joseph Smith should not prove faithful to the great trust in  the days of his preparation and qualification, and before he became  thoroughly seasoned and fitted for this important calling. In such an  emergency the power of necessity must have been conferred by Joseph  Smith on his successor, for he held the keys; therefore, the Lord  declared that in case of the prophet's transgression or removal, he  would still retain the power in that case to ordain his successor and  to confer upon such successor, whom the Lord was to choose, the keys  and authority that had been conferred upon him.    It must also be remembered that the Prophet Joseph, like the prophets  of old and even the Savior Himself, had to continue from grace to grace  and \"increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God,\" and with  him, as with the Master, \"he received not a fulnesss at first;\" but  through trials, tribulations, and varied experiences, had to prove  his worthiness before God in order that he might hold the keys of the  kingdom. It was during this period of preparation that the expression  in the revelations quoted were given regarding the appointment of  a successor; but later the Lord revealed more of His will, and the  Church was established with all the proper officers and quorums for  its guidance and perpetuity, when death should remove its President.  Moreover, while in these revelations the Lord prepared the means of  a successor in case of the transgression or removal of Joseph Smith,  later when he had proved himself and evinced before God through his  faithfulness that he was worthy of the trust placed in him, the Lord  declared that the keys of the kingdom should never be taken from him in  the following words:        \"Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily, I say unto you my son,      thy sins are forgiven thee according to thy petition, for thy      prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears;      Therefore thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of      the kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the      last time.        \"Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall NEVER be      taken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world      to come; nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to      another, yea, even unto the CHURCH.\"    I take it as a natural sequence that this law which was given in March,  1833, superseded the provision made in 1830 and winter of 1831, wherein  a law was given as a protection to the Church in case of the taking  away of the keys from Joseph the Prophet--a contingency that did not  arise.[1] Later in the year 1835, when the Twelve Apostles were chosen  and their duties defined, the Lord declared that they were equal with  the Presidency as a quorum. That is, in case of the dissolution or  destruction of the First Presidency of the Church, the Twelve should  succeed to the presidency, and would thus act until such time and  place as the Lord revealed that the First Presidency should be again  organized. And whenever the First Presidency should be disorganized it  would devolve upon the Apostles' quorum to set in order and direct the  affairs of the Church. I quote from the one hundred and seventh section.        \"And they (that is the Twelve) form a quorum, equal in authority      and power to the three Presidents previously mentioned.        \"The Seventy are also called to preach the Gospel and to be      especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world. Thus      differing from other officers in the Church in the duties of their      calling.        \"And they form a quorum equal in authority to that of the Twelve      special"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#14)"],[1," still engaged in  global warfare. After victory over Japan this estimate was revised to 50.5  billion dollars. Further cut-backs and accelerated demobilization have made  possible an additional reduction in the rate of war spending. During the  first 6 months 32.9 billion dollars were spent. It is now estimated that  16.1 billion dollars will be spent during the second 6 months, or a total  of 49 billion dollars during the whole fiscal year.    For the fiscal year 1947 it is estimated, tentatively, that expenditures  for war liquidation, for occupation, and for national defense will be  reduced to 15 billion dollars. The War and Navy Departments are expected to  spend 13 billion dollars; expenditures of other agencies, such as the  United States Maritime Commission, the War Shipping Administration, and the  Office of Price Administration, and payments to the United Nations Relief  and Rehabilitation Administration are estimated at 3 billion dollars.  Allowing for estimated net receipts of 1 billion dollars arising from war  activities of the Reconstruction finance Corporation, the estimated total  of war expenditures is 15 billion dollars. At this time only a tentative  break-down of the total estimate for war and defense activities can be  indicated.    An expenditure of 15 billion dollars for war liquidation, occupation, and  national defense is a large sum for a year which begins 10 months after  fighting has ended. It is 10 times our expenditures for defense before the  war; it amounts to about 10 percent of our expected national income. This  estimate reflects the immense job that is involved in winding up a global  war effort and stresses the great responsibility that victory has placed  upon this country. The large expenditures needed for our national defense  emphasize the great scope for effective organization in furthering economy  and efficiency. To this end I have recently recommended to the Congress  adoption of legislation combining the War and Navy Departments into a  single Department of National Defense.    A large part of these expenditures is still to be attributed to the costs  of the war. Assuming, somewhat arbitrarily, that about one-half of the  15-billion-dollar outlay for the fiscal year 1947 is for war liquidation,  aggregate expenditures by this Government for the second World War are now  estimated at 347 billion dollars through June 30, 1947. Of this, about 9  billion dollars will have been recovered through renegotiation and sale of  surplus property by June 30, 1947; this has been reflected in the estimates  of receipts.    Demobilization and strength of armed forces.--Demobilization of our armed  forces is proceeding rapidly. At the time of victory in Europe, about 12.3  million men and women were in the armed forces; 7.6 million were overseas.  By the end of December 1945 our armed forces had been reduced to below 7  million. By June 30, 1946, they will number about 2.9 million, of whom 1.8  million will be individuals enlisted and inducted after VE-day.  Mustering-out pay is a large item of our war liquidation expense; it will  total 2.5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946, and about 500 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1947.    In the fiscal year 1947 the strength of our armed forces will still be  above the ultimate peacetime level. As I have said, War and Navy Department  requirements indicate a strength of about 2 million in the armed forces a  year from now. This is necessary to enable us to do our share in the  occupation of enemy territories and in the preservation of peace in a  troubled world. Expenditures for pay, subsistence, travel, and  miscellaneous expenses of the armed forces, excluding mustering-out pay,  are estimated at 5 billion dollars.    Contract settlement and surplus property disposal.--The winding up of war  procurement is the second most important liquidation job. By the end of  November a total of 301,000 prime contracts involving commitments of 64  billion dollars had been terminated. Of this total, 67,000 contracts with  commitments of 35 billion dollars remained to be settled. Termination  payments on these contracts are estimated at about 3.5 billion dollars. It  is expected that more than half of these terminated contracts will be  settled during the current fiscal year, leaving payments of about 1.5  billion dollars for the fiscal year 1947.    Another important aspect of war supply liquidation is the disposal of  surplus property. Munitions, ships, plants, installations, and supplies,  originally costing 50 billion dollars or more, will ultimately be declared  surplus. The sale value of this property will be far less than original  cost and disposal expenses are estimated at 10 to 15 cents on each dollar  realized. Disposal units within existing agencies have been organized to  liquidate surplus property under the direction of the Surplus Property  Administration. Overseas disposal activities have been centralized in the  State Department to permit this program to be carried on in line with  over-all foreign policy. Thus far only about 13 billion dollars of the  ultimate surplus, including 5 billion dollars of unsalable aircraft, has  been declared. Of this amount, 2.3 billion dollars have been disposed of,  in sales yielding 600 million dollars. The tremendous job of handling  surplus stocks will continue to affect Federal expenditures and receipts  for several years. The speed and effectiveness of surplus disposal  operations will be of great importance for the domestic economy as well as  for foreign economic policies.    War supplies, maintenance, and relief.-Adequate provision for the national  defense requires that we keep abreast of scientific and technical advances.  The tentative estimates for the fiscal year 1947 make allowance for  military research, limited procurement of weapons in the developmental  state, and some regular procurement of munitions which were developed but  not mass-produced when the war ended. Expenditures for procurement and  construction will constitute one-third or less of total defense outlays,  compared to a ratio of two-thirds during the war years.    The estimates also provide for the maintenance of our war-expanded naval  and merchant fleets, military installations, and stocks of military  equipment and supplies. Our naval combatant fleet is three times its  pre-Pearl Harbor tonnage. Our Merchant Marine is five times its prewar  size. The War Department has billions of dollars worth of equipment and  supplies. Considerable maintenance and repair expense is necessary for the  equipment which we desire to retain in active status or in war reserve.  Expenses will be incurred for winnowing the stocks of surpluses, for  preparing lay-up facilities for the reserve fleets, and for storage of  reserve equipment and supplies.    Military expenditures .in the current fiscal year include 650 million  dollars for civilian supplies for the prevention of starvation and disease  in occupied areas. Expenditures on this account will continue in the fiscal  year 1947. The war expenditures also cover the expenses of civilian  administration in occupied areas.    During the war, 15 cents of each dollar of our war expenditures was for  lend-lease aid. With lend-lease terminated, I expect the direct operations  under this program to be substantially completed in the current fiscal  year. The expenditures estimated for the fiscal year 1947 under this  program are mainly interagency reimbursements for past transactions.    Relief and rehabilitation expenditures are increasing. It is imperative  that we give all necessary aid within our means to the people who have  borne the ravages of war. I estimate that in the fiscal year 1946  expenditures for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation  Administration will total 1.3 billion dollars and in the following year 1.2  billion dollars. Insofar as possible, procurement for this purpose will be  from war surpluses.    (b) Authorizations for war and national defense.    During the war, authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in  advance of obligation and spending to afford ample time for planning of  production by the procurement services and by industry. Thus our cumulative  war program authorized in the period between July 1, 1940, and July 1,  1945, was 431 billion dollars, including net war commitments of Government  corporations. Expenditures against those authorizations totaled 290 billion  dollars. This left 141 billion dollars in unobligated authorizations and  unliquidated obligations.    With the end of fighting, it became necessary to adjust war authorizations  to the requirements of war liquidation and continuing national defense.  Intensive review of the war authorizations by both the executive and the  legislative branches has been continued since VJ-day. As a result, the  authorized war program is being brought more nearly into line with  expenditures.    Recisions and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946.--Readjusting the  war program, as the Congress well knows, is not an easy task.  Authorizations must not be too tight, lest we hamper necessary operations;  they must not be too ample, lest we lose control of spending. Last  September, I transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of  which the Congress voted H.R. 4407 to repeal 50.3 billion dollars of  appropriations and authorizations. I found it necessary to veto this bill  because it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would impair the  reemployment program. However, in order to preserve the fine work of the  Congress on the recisions, I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget  to place the exact amounts indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable reserve,  and to advise the departments and agencies accordingly. This has been  done.    In accord with Public Law 132 of the Seventy-ninth Congress, I have  transmitted recommendations for additional"]]]
