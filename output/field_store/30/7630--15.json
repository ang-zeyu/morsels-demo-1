[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#14)"],[1,"the  golden age of art appears under Pericles and Alexander, and the sway of  taste becomes more general, strength and liberty have abandoned Greece;  eloquence corrupts the truth, wisdom offends it on the lips of Socrates,  and virtue in the life of Phocion. It is well known that the Romans had  to exhaust their energies in civil wars, and, corrupted by Oriental  luxury, to bow their heads under the yoke of a fortunate despot, before  Grecian art triumphed over the stiffness of their character. The same  was the case with the Arabs: civilization only dawned upon them when the  vigor of their military spirit became softened under the sceptre of the  Abbassides. Art did not appear in modern Italy till the glorious Lombard  League was dissolved, Florence submitting to the Medici; and all those  brave cities gave up the spirit of independence for an inglorious  resignation. It is almost superfluous to call to mind the example of  modern nations, with whom refinement has increased in direct proportion  to the decline of their liberties. Wherever we direct our eyes in past  times, we see taste and freedom mutually avoiding each other. Everywhere  we see that the beautiful only founds its sway on the ruins of heroic  virtues.    And yet this strength of character, which is commonly sacrificed to  establish aesthetic culture, is the most powerful spring of all that is  great and excellent in man, and no other advantage, however great, can  make up for it. Accordingly, if we only keep to the experiments hitherto  made, as to the influence of the beautiful, we cannot certainly be much  encouraged in developing feelings so dangerous to the real culture of  man. At the risk of being hard and coarse, it will seem preferable to  dispense with this dissolving force of the beautiful rather than see  human nature a prey to its enervating influence, notwithstanding all its  refining advantages. However, experience is perhaps not the proper  tribunal at which to decide such a question; before giving so much weight  to its testimony, it would be well to inquire if the beauty we have been  discussing is the power that is condemned by the previous examples. And  the beauty we are discussing seems to assume an idea of the beautiful  derived from a source different from experience, for it is this higher  notion of the beautiful which has to decide if what is called beauty by  experience is entitled to the name.    This pure and rational idea of the beautiful--supposing it can be placed  in evidence--cannot be taken from any real and special case, and must, on  the contrary, direct and give sanction to our judgment in each special  case. It must therefore be sought for by a process of abstraction, and  it ought to be deduced from the simple possibility of a nature both  sensuous and rational; in short, beauty ought to present itself as a  necessary condition of humanity. It is therefore essential that we  should rise to the pure idea of humanity, and as experience shows us  nothing but individuals, in particular cases, and never humanity at  large, we must endeavor to find in their individual and variable mode of  being the absolute and the permanent, and to grasp the necessary  conditions of their existence, suppressing all accidental limits. No  doubt this transcendental procedure will remove us for some time from the  familiar circle of phenomena, and the living presence of objects, to keep  us on the unproductive ground of abstract idea; but we are engaged in the  search after a principle of knowledge solid enough not to be shaken by  anything, and the man who does not dare to rise above reality will never  conquer this truth.          LETTER XI.      If abstraction rises to as great an elevation as possible, it arrives at  two primary ideas, before which it is obliged to stop and to recognize  its limits. It distinguishes in man something that continues, and  something that changes incessantly. That which continues it names his  person; that which changes his position, his condition.    The person and the condition, I and my determinations, which we represent  as one and the same thing in the necessary being, are eternally distinct  in the finite being. Notwithstanding all continuance in the person, the  condition changes; in spite of all change of condition the person  remains. We pass from rest to activity, from emotion to indifference,  from assent to contradiction, but we are always we ourselves, and what  immediately springs from ourselves remains. It is only in the absolute  subject that all his determinations continue with his personality. All  that Divinity is, it is because it is so; consequently it is eternally  what it is, because it is eternal.    As the person and the condition are distinct in man, because he is a  finite being, the condition cannot be founded on the person, nor the  person on the condition. Admitting the second case, the person would  have to change; and in the former case, the condition would have to  continue. Thus in either supposition, either the personality or the  quality of a finite being would necessarily cease. It is not because we  think, feel, and will that we are; it is not because we are that we  think, feel, and will. We are because we are. We feel, think, and will  because there is out of us something that is not ourselves.    Consequently the person must have its principle of existence in itself,  because the permanent cannot be derived from the changeable, and thus we  should be at once in possession of the idea of the absolute being,  founded on itself; that is to say, of the idea of freedom. The condition  must have a foundation, and as it is not through the person, and is not  therefore absolute, it must be a sequence and a result; and thus, in the  second place, we should have arrived at the condition of every  independent being, of everything in the process of becoming something  else: that is, of the idea of tine. \"Time is the necessary condition of  all processes, of becoming (Werden);\" this is an identical proposition,  for it says nothing but this: \"That something may follow, there must be a  succession.\"    The person which manifested itself in the eternally continuing Ego, or I  myself, and only in him, cannot become something or begin in time,  because it is much rather time that must begin with him, because the  permanent must serve as basis to the changeable. That change may take  place, something must change; this something cannot therefore be the  change itself. When we say the flower opens and fades, we make of this  flower a permanent being in the midst of this transformation; we lend it,  in some sort, a personality, in which these two conditions are  manifested. It cannot be objected that man is born, and becomes  something; for man is not only a person simply, but he is a person  finding himself in a determinate condition. Now our determinate state of  condition springs up in time, and it is thus that man, as a phenomenon or  appearance, must have a beginning, though in him pure intelligence is  eternal. Without time, that is, without a becoming, he would not be a  determinate being; his personality would exist virtually no doubt, but  not in action. It is not by the succession of its perceptions that the  immutable Ego or person manifests himself to himself.    Thus, therefore, the matter of activity, or reality, that the supreme  intelligence draws from its own being, must be received by man; and he  does, in fact, receive it, through the medium of perception, as something  which is outside him in space, and which changes in him in time. This  matter which changes in him is always accompanied by the Ego, the  personality, that never changes; and the rule prescribed for man by his  rational nature is to remain immutably himself in the midst of change, to  refer all perceptions to experience, that is, to the unity of knowledge,  and to make of each of its manifestations of its modes in time the law of  all time. The matter only exists in as far as it changes: he, his  personality, only exists in as far as he does not change. Consequently,  represented in his perfection, man would be the permanent unity, which  remains always the same, among the waves of change.    Now, although an infinite being, a divinity could not become (or be  subject to time), still a tendency ought to be named divine which has for  its infinite end the most characteristic attribute of the divinity; the  absolute manifestation of power--the reality of all the possible--and the  absolute unity of the manifestation (the necessity of all reality). It  cannot be disputed that man bears within himself, in his personality, a  predisposition for divinity. The way to divinity--if the word \"way\" can  be applied to what never leads to its end--is open to him in every  direction.    Considered in itself, and independently of all sensuous matter, his  personality is nothing but the pure virtuality of a possible infinite  manifestation; and so long as there is neither intuition nor feeling, it  is nothing more than a form, an empty power. Considered in itself, and  independently of all spontaneous activity of the mind, sensuousness can  only make a material man; without it, it is a pure form; but it cannot in  any way establish a union between matter and it. So long as he only  feels, wishes, and acts under the influence of desire, he is nothing more  than the world, if by this word we point out only the formless contents  of time. Without doubt, it is only his sensuousness that makes his  strength pass into efficacious acts, but it is his personality alone that  makes this activity his own. Thus, that he may not only be a world, he  must give form to matter, and in order not to be a mere form, he must  give reality to the virtuality that he bears in him. He gives matter to  form by creating time, and by opposing the immutable to change, the  diversity of the world to the eternal unity of the Ego."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#14)"],[1,"  upon Barsoom.    \"But that there might be no mistake I despatched a priest of your  own holy cult to make the test that should pierce his disguise and  reveal the truth.  Behold the result!\" and Thurid pointed a rigid  finger at my forehead.    All eyes followed the direction of that accusing digit--I alone  seemed at a loss to guess what fatal sign rested upon my brow.    The officer beside me guessed my perplexity; and as the brows of  Kulan Tith darkened in a menacing scowl as his eyes rested upon  me, the noble drew a small mirror from his pocket-pouch and held  it before my face.    One glance at the reflection it gave back to me was sufficient.    From my forehead the hand of the sneaking thern had reached out  through the concealing darkness of my bed-chamber and wiped away a  patch of the disguising red pigment as broad as my palm.  Beneath  showed the tanned texture of my own white skin.    For a moment Thurid ceased speaking, to enhance, I suspect, the  dramatic effect of his disclosure.  Then he resumed.    \"Here, O Kulan Tith,\" he cried, \"is he who has desecrated the temples of  the Gods of Mars, who has violated the persons of the Holy Therns  themselves and turned a world against its age-old religion.  Before  you, in your power, Jeddak of Kaol, Defender of the Holies, stands  John Carter, Prince of Helium!\"    Kulan Tith looked toward Matai Shang as though for corroboration  of these charges.  The Holy Thern nodded his head.    \"It is indeed the arch-blasphemer,\" he said.  \"Even now he has  followed me to the very heart of thy palace, Kulan Tith, for the  sole purpose of assassinating me.  He--\"    \"He lies!\" I cried.  \"Kulan Tith, listen that you may know the  truth.  Listen while I tell you why John Carter has followed Matai  Shang to the heart of thy palace.  Listen to me as well as to them,  and then judge if my acts be not more in accord with true Barsoomian  chivalry and honor than those of these revengeful devotees of the  spurious creeds from whose cruel bonds I have freed your planet.\"    \"Silence!\" roared the jeddak, leaping to his feet and laying his  hand upon the hilt of his sword.  \"Silence, blasphemer!  Kulan Tith  need not permit the air of his audience chamber to be defiled by  the heresies that issue from your polluted throat to judge you.    \"You stand already self-condemned.  It but remains to determine  the manner of your death.  Even the service that you rendered the  arms of Kaol shall avail you naught; it was but a base subterfuge  whereby you might win your way into my favor and reach the side  of this holy man whose life you craved.  To the pits with him!\" he  concluded, addressing the officer of my guard.    Here was a pretty pass, indeed!  What chance had I against a whole  nation?  What hope for me of mercy at the hands of the fanatical  Kulan Tith with such advisers as Matai Shang and Thurid.  The black  grinned malevolently in my face.    \"You shall not escape this time, Earth man,\" he taunted.    The guards closed toward me.  A red haze blurred my vision.  The  fighting blood of my Virginian sires coursed hot through my veins.  The lust of battle in all its mad fury was upon me.    With a leap I was beside Thurid, and ere the devilish smirk had  faded from his handsome face I had caught him full upon the mouth  with my clenched fist; and as the good, old American blow landed,  the black dator shot back a dozen feet, to crumple in a heap at  the foot of Kulan Tith's throne, spitting blood and teeth from his  hurt mouth.    Then I drew my sword and swung round, on guard, to face a nation.    In an instant the guardsmen were upon me, but before a blow had  been struck a mighty voice rose above the din of shouting warriors,  and a giant figure leaped from the dais beside Kulan Tith and, with  drawn long-sword, threw himself between me and my adversaries.    It was the visiting jeddak.    \"Hold!\" he cried.  \"If you value my friendship, Kulan Tith, and the  age-old peace that has existed between our peoples, call off your  swordsmen; for wherever or against whomsoever fights John Carter,  Prince of Helium, there beside him and to the death fights Thuvan  Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth.\"    The shouting ceased and the menacing points were lowered as a  thousand eyes turned first toward Thuvan Dihn in surprise and then  toward Kulan Tith in question.  At first the Jeddak of Kaol went  white in rage, but before he spoke he had mastered himself, so  that his tone was calm and even as befitted intercourse between  two great jeddaks.    \"Thuvan Dihn,\" he said slowly, \"must have great provocation thus  to desecrate the ancient customs which inspire the deportment of  a guest within the palace of his host.  Lest I, too, should forget  myself as has my royal friend, I should prefer to remain silent  until the Jeddak of Ptarth has won from me applause for his action  by relating the causes which provoked it.\"    I could see that the Jeddak of Ptarth was of half a mind to throw  his metal in Kulan Tith's face, but he controlled himself even as  well as had his host.    \"None knows better than Thuvan Dihn,\" he said, \"the laws which govern  the acts of men in the domains of their neighbors; but Thuvan Dihn  owes allegiance to a higher law than these--the law of gratitude.  Nor to any man upon Barsoom does he owe a greater debt of gratitude  than to John Carter, Prince of Helium.    \"Years ago, Kulan Tith,\" he continued, \"upon the occasion of your  last visit to me, you were greatly taken with the charms and graces  of my only daughter, Thuvia.  You saw how I adored her, and later  you learned that, inspired by some unfathomable whim, she had  taken the last, long, voluntary pilgrimage upon the cold bosom of  the mysterious Iss, leaving me desolate.    \"Some months ago I first heard of the expedition which John Carter  had led against Issus and the Holy Therns.  Faint rumors of the  atrocities reported to have been committed by the therns upon those  who for countless ages have floated down the mighty Iss came to my  ears.    \"I heard that thousands of prisoners had been released, few of  whom dared to return to their own countries owing to the mandate of  terrible death which rests against all who return from the Valley  Dor.    \"For a time I could not believe the heresies which I heard, and  I prayed that my daughter Thuvia might have died before she ever  committed the sacrilege of returning to the outer world.  But then  my father's love asserted itself, and I vowed that I would prefer  eternal damnation to further separation from her if she could be  found.    \"So I sent emissaries to Helium, and to the court of Xodar, Jeddak  of the First Born, and to him who now rules those of the thern  nation that have renounced their religion; and from each and all  I heard the same story of unspeakable cruelties and atrocities  perpetrated upon the poor defenseless victims of their religion by  the Holy Therns.    \"Many there were who had seen or known my daughter, and from therns  who had been close to Matai Shang I learned of the indignities that  he personally heaped upon her; and I was glad when I came here to  find that Matai Shang was also your guest, for I should have sought  him out had it taken a lifetime.    \"More, too, I heard, and that of the chivalrous kindness that John  Carter had accorded my daughter.  They told me how he fought for  her and rescued her, and how he spurned escape from the savage  Warhoons of the south, sending her to safety upon his own thoat  and remaining upon foot to meet the green warriors.    \"Can you wonder, Kulan Tith, that I am willing to jeopardize  my life, the peace of my nation, or even your friendship, which I  prize more than aught else, to champion the Prince of Helium?\"    For a moment Kulan Tith was silent.  I could see by the expression  of his face that he was sore perplexed.  Then he spoke.    \"Thuvan Dihn,\" he said, and his tone was friendly though sad,  \"who am I to judge my fellow-man?  In my eyes the Father of Therns  is still holy, and the religion which he teaches the only true  religion, but were I faced by the same problem that has vexed you  I doubt not that I should feel and act precisely as you have.    \"In so far as the Prince of Helium is concerned I may act, but between  you and Matai Shang my only office can be one of conciliation.  The  Prince of Helium shall be escorted in safety to the boundary of  my domain ere the sun has set again, where he shall be free to go  whither he will; but upon pain of death must he never again enter  the land of Kaol.    \"If there be a quarrel between you and the Father of Therns, I  need not ask that the settlement of it be deferred until both have  passed beyond the limits of my power.  Are you satisfied, Thuvan  Dihn?\"    The Jeddak of Ptarth nodded his assent, but the ugly scowl that he  bent upon Matai Shang harbored ill for that pasty-faced godling.    \"The Prince of Helium is far from satisfied,\" I cried, breaking  rudely in upon the beginnings of peace, for I had no stomach for  peace at the price that had been named.    \"I have escaped death in a dozen forms to follow Matai Shang and  overtake him, and I do not intend to be led, like a decrepit thoat  to the slaughter, from the goal that I have won by the prowess of  my sword arm and the might of my muscles.    \"Nor will Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, be satisfied when he has  heard me through.  Do you know why I have followed Matai Shang and  Thurid, the black dator, from the forests of the Valley Dor across  half a world through almost insurmountable difficulties?    \"Think you that John Carter, Prince of Helium, would stoop to  assassination?  Can Kulan Tith be such a fool as to believe that  lie, whispered in his ear by the Holy Thern or Dator Thurid?    \"I do not follow Matai Shang to kill him, though the God of mine  own planet knows that my hands itch to be at his throat.  I follow  him, Thuvan Dihn, because with him are two"]]]
