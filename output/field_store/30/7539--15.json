I could easily  have replied to \"M\" myself, and made him an object of ridicule, but I  thought it would be better to have the reply come from a Mormon. My  original article neither endorsed nor condemned. I merely told facts  and the truth as I saw them. And I personally am an agnostic. It is  only from that class that you can get justice.    This article of yours will create a profound impression all over New  England. It is so complete and conclusive that I anticipate nothing  more from the \"jaundiced\" \"M.\" I send you copy of Journal.    Yours cordially,    L. C. BATEMAN.    I.    Eastern Eulogy of Mormons' System.    _To Editors of the Lewiston Journal:_    The _Deseret News_ of Salt Lake City, which is the official organ of  the Mormon priesthood, in its issue of Aug. 6th, contains an editorial  expressing its great satisfaction over the recent eulogistic article in  the _Journal,_ on the merits of the Mormons and their peculiar system,  by the Journal's representative, Mr. L. C. Bateman.    Having lived in Utah for over twenty-five years, striving with other  law-abiding citizens to establish here the same American ideas which  are accepted as fundamental in the other states of the Union, I have  had ample opportunity to study the Mormon system and its fruits. And I  am prepared to say that, while I have never had anything but the utmost  good will for the masses of the Mormon people, I am forced to join with  other careful students in declaring that from a social, civil, and  moral standpoint, no language is strong enough to set forth the evil  fruits of the Mormon system.    Based on polygamy, how could the system be otherwise than rotten? Its  central idea of government being that of priesthood rule, how could  it be otherwise than anti-American? Having been founded and organized  by a man as corrupt and immoral as the multiplied testimony of Joseph  Smith's acquaintances and neighbors proves that he was, how could it be  otherwise than mischievous and immoral in its tendencies and results?  On the part of loyal Americans who have studied the Mormon system here  on the ground for years, there is no difference of opinion about the  inherent badness of the system and of its fruits, although many, unduly  influenced by what they consider business policy, are reluctant to say  much about it.    Some fifteen years ago, Mr. James Barclay, a member of the English  Parliament, spent three days in Salt Lake City studying Mormonism.  He surrendered himself to the control of the Mormon leaders. He was  dined at the Amelia Palace, at that time the residence of the Mormon  president, and attended other receptions in his honor at prominent  Mormon residences. He saw everything through Mormon spectacles.  When he went back to London, he published in the popular Nineteenth  Century Magazine, a most glowing eulogy of the Mormon system. The  Mormon leaders had been so successful with their hospitality scheme,  that the Hon. Mr. Barclay had nothing but praise for those who were  pushing forward their law-defying system of polygamy and nothing but  condemnation for those who were trying to enforce the righteous laws of  the land against it.    The Journal's representative seems to have seen things much as the Hon.  Mr. Barclay. However, that may be, the Mormons have palmed off upon  him, as they did on Mr. Barclay, those old yarns about their changing  the barren desert of this valley into a blooming garden, and about  \"the persecutions\" from which they have suffered in Utah. The first of  these old chestnuts was laid on the shelf years ago here in the west,  because there is no truth in it. There never was any barren desert  in this valley, for it has always been one of the best-watered, most  easily cultivated and productive valleys west of the Mississippi. The  Mormons raised bountiful crops of grain the very first year of their  arrival. The difficulty of securing a crop here in this fertile valley  with its mild and equable climate, was very small in comparison with  the difficulties encountered by the first settlers of New England along  the bleak Atlantic shore. Furthermore, what a mercy it would have  been to our whole country if Utah had remained unsettled for another  twenty-five years, if then it could have been occupied by law-abiding  Americans in sympathy with American civilization, such men as have  built up the noble states of Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas.    The Journal's representative says: \"But even here they were not safe  from the persecutions of their enemies.\" That fictitious yarn has been  worked off on many a foreigner. But we did not suppose it possible  to catch an American newspaperman with such a bare hook as that. The  Mormons had this territory almost exclusively to themselves for about  twenty-five years, and did practically as they pleased from 1847 until  1882, when the first Edmunds Law called them to a halt. The terrible  \"persecutions\" complained of consist simply in this and nothing more,  namely, that the Mormons were asked, and after some thirty-five years  were required, to obey just the same laws which all other people and  other religious bodies have always obeyed in this country. But the  Mormon leaders have left nothing undone to make the people under  them believe, and all outsiders whom they could influence, that the  enforcement of these righteous laws which are obeyed by the American  people generally, was \"persecution.\"    But here is another paragraph from the article under discussion, which  shows that the Journal's correspondent was as completely imposed upon  as was the Hon. Mr. Barclay. He says, as quoted by the _Deseret News:_        \"The only charge that can be laid at their doors today is that they      refuse to desert their wives that they married in good faith (!)      And they are right. To turn these women out of doors to subsist at      the hands of charity would be a vastly worse crime in the eyes of      God and decent-minded men than to make the provision for them that      they are now doing.\"    The law-breaking polygamists could not have stated their case more  satisfactorily to themselves. But what is the matter with the Journal's  representative? Of course, he knows that polygamy is an atrocious crime  in this country, and has been so considered since our government was  founded. Why, then, does he talk about committing the crime of polygamy  \"in good faith?\" As well talk about committing the crime of bank  robbing \"in good faith.\" Indeed, it would not be difficult to show that  bank-robbery, bad as it is, does less harm to society than polygamy.    Furthermore none of the opponents of polygamy have ever asked that  plural wives should be \"turned out of doors.\" Nobody has objected  to having plural wives and their children kindly provided for  by the men who placed them in their unlawful position. But the  law-abiding citizens of Utah and the Federal Government also make  a wide distinction between providing for these plural wives and  their children, and providing these same plural wives with children.  The whole difficulty grows out of the fact that the men who were  living with plural wives before Utah became a State still persist in  maintaining the old polygamous relations with these women, and that,  too, in the face of the solemn pledges to the United States government  that if granted amnesty and statehood they would forthwith abandon  all polygamous relations of every kind. Over ten years have passed  since amnesty was granted by the government on the above condition,  and yet all over the State men are living in polygamy the same as  before statehood. The president of the Mormon Church, with his five  wives, encourages these law-breakers by his example, and then tries  to belittle the offense by claiming that the number of men living in  polygamy is quite small, not over 756. The _Deseret News_ at first  denied that there are any such cases, but was forced to admit that  it was mistaken. It then tried to belittle the matter by claiming  that there were only 1,543 such cases! Suppose someone should argue  that Maine is a good moral State because it contains only 1,543 bank  robbers! Of course the _News_ naturally underestimates the number.    In the closing paragraph of the article in the Journal occurs the  following statement: \"Common justice and common honesty, however,  require him (the writer) to say that aside from the one peculiar  feature of polygamy, he fails to see wherein the Mormon religion, is  not just as pure as the different forms to which we are accustomed in  the East.\"    No one who is acquainted with the fundamental doctrines of Mormonism  and with the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion would make  any such sweeping and misleading statement as that.    Mormonism holds and teaches the heathen doctrine of polytheism, the  doctrine of many gods. (Pratt's Key to Theology, Chap. vi.) It teaches  that Adam is God \"and the only God with whom we have to do.\" (Brigham  Young in Journal of Discourses, Vol. I, page 50.) It makes belief in  the alleged divine mission and authority of that most immoral and  wicked man, Joseph Smith, a fundamental doctrine of its religious  system. (Brigham Young in Millennial Star Vol. v, page 118.)    It teaches that the coarse and vulgar men who make up the Mormon  priesthood must be obeyed by the people because they possess divine  authority, and that those who reject the commands of this bogus  priesthood reject God. (Elder Roberts' New Witness for God, page 187.)    It teaches that Jesus Christ, the Divine Savior of the world, was  a polygamist, and many other horrible doctrines which are utterly  repugnant to the pure and lofty morality of the Christian religion.    The Mormons have lived in five different states, namely, Ohio,  Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Utah. If their system is as pure morally  and as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#14)"],[1,", all the questions of  securing the rights of labor, all the hopes of freedom at home and  humanity abroad, rest upon the creation of international good-will.    So long as hatred, suspicion, and fear dominate the feelings of men  toward each other, so long we cannot hope to escape from the tyranny  of violence and brute force.  Men must learn to be conscious of the  common interests of mankind in which all are at one, rather than of  those supposed interests in which the nations are divided.  It is not  necessary, or even desirable, to obliterate the differences of manners  and custom and tradition between different nations.  These differences  enable each nation to make its own distinctive contribution to the sum  total of the world's civilization.    What is to be desired is not cosmopolitanism, not the absence of all  national characteristics that one associates with couriers,  _wagon-lit_ attendants, and others, who have had everything  distinctive obliterated by multiple and trivial contacts with men of  every civilized country.  Such cosmopolitanism is the result of loss,  not gain.  The international spirit which we should wish to see  produced will be something added to love of country, not something  taken away.  Just as patriotism does not prevent a man from feeling  family affection, so the international spirit ought not to prevent a  man from feeling affection for his own country.  But it will somewhat  alter the character of that affection.  The things which he will  desire for his own country will no longer be things which can only be  acquired at the expense of others, but rather those things in which  the excellence of any one country is to the advantage of all the  world.  He will wish his own country to be great in the arts of peace,  to be eminent in thought and science, to be magnanimous and just and  generous.  He will wish it to help mankind on the way toward that  better world of liberty and international concord which must be  realized if any happiness is to be left to man.  He will not desire  for his country the passing triumphs of a narrow possessiveness, but  rather the enduring triumph of having helped to embody in human  affairs something of that spirit of brotherhood which Christ taught  and which the Christian churches have forgotten.  He will see that  this spirit embodies not only the highest morality, but also the  truest wisdom, and the only road by which the nations, torn and  bleeding with the wounds which scientific madness has inflicted, can  emerge into a life where growth is possible and joy is not banished at  the frenzied call of unreal and fictitious duties.  Deeds inspired by  hate are not duties, whatever pain and self-sacrifice they may  involve.  Life and hope for the world are to be found only in the  deeds of love."]]]
