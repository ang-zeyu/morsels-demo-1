When once that light which was in them is taken from them they      become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and      then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against      the truth, and they, Judas like, seek the destruction of those      who were their greatest benefactors. What nearer friend on earth,      or in heaven, had Judas than the Savior? And his first object was      to destroy Him. Who, among all the Saints in these last days, can      consider himself as good as our Lord? Who is as perfect? Who is      as pure? Who is as holy as He was? Are they to be found? He never      transgressed or broke a commandment or law of heaven--no deceit was      in His mouth, neither was guile found in His heart. And yet one      that ate with Him, who had often drunk of the same cup, was the      first to lift up his heel against Him. Where is one like Christ? He      cannot be found on earth. Then why should His followers complain,      if from those whom they once called brethren, and considered as      standing in the nearest relation in the everlasting covenant they      should receive persecution? From what source emanated the principle      which has ever been manifested by apostates from the true Church to      persecute with double diligence, and seek with double perseverance,      to destroy those whom they once professed to love, with whom they      once communed, and with whom they once covenanted to strive with      every power in righteousness to obtain the rest of God? Perhaps our      brethren will say the same that caused Satan to seek to overthrow      the kingdom of God, because he himself was evil, and God's kingdom      is holy. * * * * * * * * * *        The great plan of salvation is a theme which ought to occupy our      strict attention, and be regarded as one of heaven's best gifts to      mankind. No consideration whatever ought to deter us from showing      ourselves approved in the sight of God, according to His divine      requirement. Men not unfrequently forget that they are dependent      upon {24} heaven for every blessing which they are permitted to      enjoy, and that for every opportunity granted them they are to      give an account. You know, brethren, that when the Master in the      Savior's parable of the stewards called his servants before him      he gave them several talents to improve on while he should tarry      abroad for a little season, and when he returned he called for      an accounting. So it is now. Our Master is absent only for a      little season, and at the end of it He will call each to render      an account; and where the five talents were bestowed, ten will be      required; and he that has made no improvement will be cast out as      an unprofitable servant, while the faithful will enjoy everlasting      honors. Therefore we earnestly implore the grace of our Father      to rest upon you, through Jesus Christ His Son, that you may not      faint in the hour of temptation, nor be overcome in the time of      persecution.    [Sidenote: Prayer of the First Presidency.]    On the evening of the 28th of January, Brothers Oliver Cowdery,  Frederick G. Williams, and myself, being agreed, bowed before the Lord,  and united in prayer, that God would continue to deliver me and my  brethren from \"Doctor\" Hurlburt, [3]that he may not prevail against us  in the law-suit that is pending; and also that God would soften the  hearts of Eden Smith,--- Jones, ----- Lowd,--- Lyman, and also Mr.  Bardsley, that they might obey the Gospel; or if they would not repent,  that the Lord would send faithful Saints to purchase their farms, that  this Stake may be strengthened, and its borders enlarged. O Lord, grant  it for Christ's sake. Amen.    _January 31_.--It is my prayer to the Lord that three thousand  subscribers may be added to the Star in the time of three years.    [Sidenote: Preparations for Returning Exiles to Zion.]    _February 1_.--Every expedient preparation was making by the Church  in Kirtland, and Clay county, to have those who have been driven from  their possessions in Jackson county, returned.    [Sidenote: Conference of High Priests and Elders at New Portage.]    _February 9_.--A conference of High Priests, Elders and officers of the  Church of Christ in New Portage, Medina county, Ohio, was called at the  house of Brother {25} Kirlins, which I attended. It had been suggested  that Elder Rigdon might remove from Kirtland to New Portage; but after  listening to the proceedings of a previous conference in Portage, from  Brothers Palmer and Bosworth, it was decided that Elder Rigdon should  not remove; and that the brethren in New Portage should assist all  in their power to build the Lord's House in Kirtland; and that the  brethren erect only a temporary or cheap place for meeting in Portage,  as that was not to be established as a Stake of Zion at present; and  that course would enable them to do more for the House in Kirtland.    At a council of the High Priests and Elders, (Orson Hyde, clerk,) at my  house in Kirtland, on the evening of the 12th of February, I remarked  that I should endeavor to set before the council the dignity of the  office which had been conferred on me by the ministering of the angel  of God, by His own voice, and by the voice of this Church; that I had  never set before any council in all the order in which it ought to be  conducted, which, perhaps, has deprived the councils of some or many  blessings.    And I continued and said, no man is capable of judging a matter, in  council, unless his own heart is pure; and that we are frequently so  filled with prejudice, or have a beam in our own eye, that we are not  capable of passing right decisions.    [Sidenote: Order in Ancient Councils.]    But to return to the subject of order; in ancient days councils were  conducted with such strict propriety, that no one was allowed to  whisper, be weary, leave the room, or get uneasy in the least, until  the voice of the Lord, by revelation, or the voice of the council by  the Spirit, was obtained, which has not been observed in this Church to  the present time. It was understood in ancient days, that if one man  could stay in council, another could; and if the president could spend  his time, the members could also; but in our councils, generally, one  will be uneasy, another asleep; one praying, {26} another not; one's  mind on the business of the council, and another thinking on something  else.    [Sidenote: Responsibility of Those who sit in Judgment.]    Our acts are recorded, and at a future day they will be laid before us,  and if we should fail to judge right and injure our fellow-beings, they  may there, perhaps, condemn us; there they are of great consequence,  and to me the consequence appears to be of force, beyond anything which  I am able to express. Ask yourselves, brethren, how much you have  exercised yourselves in prayer since you heard of this council; and if  you are now prepared to sit in council upon the soul of your brother.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Predicted Triumph.]    I then gave a relation of my situation at the time I obtained the  record (Book of Mormon), the persecutions I met with, and prophesied  that I would stand and shine like the sun in the firmament, when my  enemies and the gainsayers of my testimony shall be put down and cut  off, and their names blotted out from among men.    [Sidenote: Trial of Martin Harris.]    The council proceeded to investigate certain charges presented by Elder  Rigdon against Martin Harris; one was, that he told A. C. Russell,  Esq., that Joseph drank too much liquor when he was translating the  Book of Mormon; and that he wrestled with many men and threw them;  and that he (Harris) exalted himself above Joseph, in that he said,  \"Brother Joseph knew not the contents of the Book of Mormon, until it  was translated, but that he himself knew all about it before it was  translated.\"    Brother Harris did not tell Esq. Russell that Brother Joseph drank  too much liquor while translating the Book of Mormon, but this thing  occurred previous to the translating of the Book; he confessed that  his mind was darkened, and that he had said many things inadvertently,  calculated to wound the feelings of his brethren, and promised to do  better. The council forgave him, with much good advice.    {27} [Sidenote: Trial of Leonard Rich.]    Brother Leonard Rich was called in question for transgressing the Word  of Wisdom, and for selling the revelations at an extortionate price,  while he was journeying east with Father Lyons, Brother Rich confessed,  and the council forgave him upon his promising to do better and reform  his life.    Footnotes    1. Of these days in Kirtland Elder Heber C. Kimball in his Journal  says, \"The Church was in a state of poverty and distress, a consequence  of which it appeared almost impossible that the commandments could  be fulfilled [relative to the Kirtland Temple]; at the same time our  enemies were raging and threatening destruction upon us, and we had to  guard ourselves night after night, and for weeks were not permitted to  take off our clothes, and were obliged to lay with our fire locks in  our arms.\"--_Times and Seasons_, vol. 6, p. 771.    2. The use of \"abroad\" here does not have reference to foreign lands,  but means those who were scattered from their homes in Missouri.    This communication of the Elders of the Church at Kirtland, to their  brethren scattered abroad, does not appear in the History of the  Prophet, but is found in the _Evening and Morning Star_, vol. 2, Nos.  17, 18, 19. The document is evidently dictated by the Prophet and is of  such doctrinal importance that it is thought proper to give it place in  the body of the Church History. It treats of the origin of law, human  and divine, and man's relations"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#14)"],[1,"of framing abstract general ideas do talk as if  they had such an idea, which is, say they, the most abstract and general  notion of all; that is, to me, the most incomprehensible of all others.  That there are a great variety of spirits of different orders and  capacities, whose faculties both in number and extent are far exceeding  those the Author of my being has bestowed on me, I see no reason to deny.  And for me to pretend to determine by my own few, stinted narrow inlets  of perception, what ideas the inexhaustible power of the Supreme Spirit  may imprint upon them were certainly the utmost folly and  presumption--since there may be, for aught that I know, innumerable sorts  of ideas or sensations, as different from one another, and from all that  I have perceived, as colours are from sounds. But, how ready soever I may  be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the  endless variety of spirits and ideas that may possibly exist, yet for any  one to pretend to a notion of Entity or Existence, abstracted from spirit  and idea, from perceived and being perceived, is, I suspect, a downright  repugnancy and trifling with words.--It remains that we consider the  objections which may possibly be made on the part of Religion.    82. OBJECTIONS DERIVED FROM THE SCRIPTURES ANSWERED.--Some there are  who think that, though the arguments for the real existence of  bodies which are drawn from Reason be allowed not to amount to  demonstration, yet the Holy Scriptures are so clear in the point as  will sufficiently convince every good Christian that bodies do really  exist, and are something more than mere ideas; there being in Holy Writ  innumerable facts related which evidently suppose the reality of timber  and stone, mountains and rivers, and cities, and human bodies. To which I  answer that no sort of writings whatever, sacred or profane, which use  those and the like words in the vulgar acceptation, or so as to have a  meaning in them, are in danger of having their truth called in question  by our doctrine. That all those things do really exist, that there are  bodies, even corporeal substances, when taken in the vulgar sense, has  been shown to be agreeable to our principles; and the difference betwixt  things and ideas, realities and chimeras, has been distinctly explained.  See sect. 29, 30, 33, 36, &c. And I do not think that either what  philosophers call Matter, or the existence of objects without the mind,  is anywhere mentioned in Scripture.    83. NO OBJECTION AS TO LANGUAGE TENABLE.--Again, whether there can  be or be not external things, it is agreed on all hands that the  proper use of words is the marking our conceptions, or things only  as they are known and perceived by us; whence it plainly follows  that in the tenets we have laid down there is nothing inconsistent  with the right use and significancy of language, and that discourse,  of what kind soever, so far as it is intelligible, remains undisturbed.  But all this seems so manifest, from what has been largely set forth  in the premises, that it is needless to insist any farther on it.    84. But, secondly it will be urged that miracles do, at least, lose much  of their stress and import by our principles. What must we think of Moses'  rod? was it not really turned into a serpent; or was there only a change  of ideas in the minds of the spectators? And, can it be supposed that our  Saviour did no more at the marriage-feast in Cana than impose on the  sight, and smell, and taste of the guests, so as to create in them the  appearance or idea only of wine? The same may be said of all other  miracles; which, in consequence of the foregoing principles, must be  looked upon only as so many cheats, or illusions of fancy. To this I  reply, that the rod was changed into a real serpent, and the water into  real wine. That this does not in the least contradict what I have  elsewhere said will be evident from sect. 34 and 35. But this business of  real and imaginary has been already so plainly and fully explained, and  so often referred to, and the difficulties about it are so easily  answered from what has gone before, that it were an affront to the  reader's understanding to resume the explication of it in its place. I  shall only observe that if at table all who were present should see, and  smell, and taste, and drink wine, and find the effects of it, with me  there could be no doubt of its reality; so that at bottom the scruple  concerning real miracles has no place at all on ours, but only on the  received principles, and consequently makes rather for than against what  has been said.    85. CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRECEDING TENETS.--Having done with the  Objections, which I endeavoured to propose in the clearest light,  and gave them all the force and weight I could, we proceed in the  next place to take a view of our tenets in their Consequences.  Some of these appear at first sight--as that several difficult and  obscure questions, on which abundance of speculation has been  thrown away, are entirely banished from philosophy. \"Whether  corporeal substance can think,\" \"whether Matter be infinitely divisible,\"  and \"how it operates on spirit\"--these and like inquiries have given  infinite amusement to philosophers in all ages; but depending on the  existence of Matter, they have no longer any place on our principles.  Many other advantages there are, as well with regard to religion as the  sciences, which it is easy for any one to deduce from what has been  premised; but this will appear more plainly in the sequel.    86. THE REMOVAL OF MATTER GIVES CERTAINTY TO KNOWLEDGE.--From the  principles we have laid down it follows human knowledge may naturally  be reduced to two heads--that of ideas and that of spirits. Of each  of these I shall treat in order.    And first as to ideas or unthinking things. Our knowledge of these has  been very much obscured and confounded, and we have been led into very  dangerous errors, by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of  sense--the one intelligible or in the mind, the other real and without  the mind; whereby unthinking things are thought to have a natural  subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits. This,  which, if I mistake not, has been shown to be a most groundless and  absurd notion, is the very root of Scepticism; for, so long as men  thought that real things subsisted without the mind, and that their  knowledge was only so far forth real as it was conformable to real  things, it follows they could not be certain they had any real knowledge  at all. For how can it be known that the things which are perceived are  conformable to those which are not perceived, or exist without the mind?    87. Colour, figure, motion, extension, and the like, considered only as  so many sensations in the mind, are perfectly known, there being nothing  in them which is not perceived. But, if they are looked on as notes or  images, referred to things or archetypes existing without the mind, then  are we involved all in scepticism. We see only the appearances, and not  the real qualities of things. What may be the extension, figure, or  motion of anything really and absolutely, or in itself, it is impossible  for us to know, but only the proportion or relation they bear to our  senses. Things remaining the same, our ideas vary, and which of them, or  even whether any of them at all, represent the true quality really  existing in the thing, it is out of our reach to determine. So that, for  aught we know, all we see, hear, and feel may be only phantom and vain  chimera, and not at all agree with the real things existing in rerum  natura. All this scepticism follows from our supposing a difference  between things and ideas, and that the former have a subsistence without  the mind or unperceived. It were easy to dilate on this subject, and show  how the arguments urged by sceptics in all ages depend on the supposition  of external objects.    88. IF THERE BE EXTERNAL MATTER, NEITHER THE NATURE NOR EXISTENCE  OF THINGS CAN BE KNOWN.--So long as we attribute a real existence to  unthinking things, distinct from their being perceived, it is not  only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real  unthinking being, but even that it exists. Hence it is that we see  philosophers distrust their senses, and doubt of the existence of  heaven and earth, of everything they see or feel, even of their own  bodies. And, after all their labour and struggle of thought, they  are forced to own we cannot attain to any self-evident or demonstrative  knowledge of the existence of sensible things. But, all this doubtfulness,  which so bewilders and confounds the mind and makes philosophy  ridiculous in the eyes of the world, vanishes if we annex a meaning  to our words, and not amuse ourselves with the terms \"absolute,\"  \"external,\" \"exist,\" and such-like, signifying we know not what. I can as  well doubt of my own being as of the being of those things which I  actually perceive by sense; it being a manifest contradiction that any  sensible object should be immediately perceived by sight or touch, and at  the same time have no existence in nature, since the very existence of an  unthinking being consists in being perceived.    89. OF THING OR BEING.--Nothing seems of more importance towards  erecting a firm system of sound and real knowledge, which may be  proof against the assaults of Scepticism, than to lay the beginning  in a distinct explication of what is meant by thing, reality,  existence; for in vain shall we dispute concerning the real existence  of things, or pretend to any knowledge thereof, so long as we have  not fixed the meaning of those words. Thing or Being is the most  general name of all; it comprehends under it two kinds entirely  distinct and heterogeneous, and which have nothing common but the  name. viz. spirits and ideas. The former are active,"]]]
