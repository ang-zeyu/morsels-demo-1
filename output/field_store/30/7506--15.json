And such intuition well might  lodge in the mysterious antennae--containing, in the case of the  workers, according to Cheshire's calculation, twelve thousand  tactile hairs and five thousand \"smell-hollows,\" wherewith they  probe and fathom the darkness. For the mutual understanding of the  bees is not confined to their habitual labours; the extraordinary  also has a name and place in their language; as is proved by the  manner in which news, good or bad, normal or supernatural, will at  once spread in the hive; the loss or return of the mother, for  instance, the entrance of an enemy, the intrusion of a strange  queen, the approach of a band of marauders, the discovery of  treasure, etc. And so characteristic is their attitude, so  essentially different their murmur at each of these special events,  that the experienced apiarist can without difficulty tell what is  troubling the crowd that moves distractedly to and fro in the  shadow.    If you desire a more definite proof, you have but to watch a bee  that shall just have discovered a few drops of honey on your  window-sill or the corner of your table. She will immediately gorge  herself with it; and so eagerly, that you will have time, without  fear of disturbing her, to mark her tiny belt with a touch of paint.  But this gluttony of hers is all on the surface; the honey will not  pass into the stomach proper, into what we might call her personal  stomach, but remains in the sac, the first stomach,--that of the  community, if one may so express it. This reservoir full, the bee  will depart, but not with the free and thoughtless motion of the fly  or butterfly; she, on the contrary, will for some moments fly  backwards, hovering eagerly about the table or window, with her head  turned toward the room.    She is reconnoitring, fixing in her memory the exact position of the  treasure. Thereupon she will go to the hive, disgorge her plunder  into one of the provision-cells, and in three or four minutes  return, and resume operations at the providential window. And thus,  while the honey lasts, will she come and go, at intervals of every  five minutes, till evening, if need be; without interruption or  rest; pursuing her regular journeys from the hive to the window,  from the window back to the hive.    {46}    Many of those who have written on bees have thought fit to adorn the  truth; I myself have no such desire. For studies of this description  to possess any interest, it is essential that they should remain  absolutely sincere. Had the conclusion been forced upon me that bees  are incapable of communicating to each other news of an event  occurring outside the hive, I should, I imagine, as a set-off  against the slight disappointment this discovery would have  entailed, have derived some degree of satisfaction in recognising  once more that man, after all, is the only truly intelligent being  who inhabits our globe. And there comes too a period of life when we  have more joy in saying the thing that is true than in saying the  thing that merely is wonderful. Here as in every case the principle  holds that, should the naked truth appear at the moment less  interesting, less great and noble than the imaginary embellishment  it lies in our power to bestow, the fault must rest with ourselves  who still are unable to perceive the astonishing relation in which  this truth always must stand to our being, and to universal law; and  in that case it is not the truth, but our intellect, that needs  embellishment and ennoblement.    I will frankly confess, therefore, that the marked bee often returns  alone. Shall we believe that in bees there exists the same  difference of character as in men; that of them too some are  gossips, and others prone to silence? A friend who stood by and  watched my experiment, declared that it was evidently mere  selfishness or vanity that caused so many of the bees to refrain  from revealing the source of their wealth, and from sharing with  others the glory of an achievement that must seem miraculous to the  hive. These were sad vices indeed, which give not forth the sweet  odour, so fragrant and loyal, that springs from the home of the many  thousand sisters. But, whatever the cause, it often will also happen  that the bee whom fortune has favoured will return to the honey  accompanied by two or three friends. I am aware that Sir John  Lubbock, in the appendix to his book on \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps,\"  records the results of his investigations in long and minute tables;  and from these we are led to infer that it is a matter of rarest  occurrence for a single bee to follow the one who has made the  discovery. The learned naturalist does not name the race of bees  which he selected for his experiments, or tell us whether the  conditions were especially unfavourable. As for myself I only can  say that my own tables, compiled with great care,--and every  possible precaution having been taken that the bees should not be  directly attracted by the odour of the honey,--establish that on an  average one bee will bring others four times out of ten.    I even one day came across an extraordinary little Italian bee,  whose belt I had marked with a touch of blue paint. In her second  trip she brought two of her sisters, whom I imprisoned, without  interfering with her. She departed once more, and this time returned  with three friends, whom I again confined, and so till the end of  the afternoon, when, counting my prisoners, I found that she had  told the news to no less than eighteen bees.    In fact you will find, if you make this experiment yourself, that  communication, if not general, at least is frequent. The possession  of this faculty is so well known to American bee-hunters that they  trade upon it when engaged in searching for nests. Mr. Josiah Emery  remarks on this head (quoted by Romanes in his \"Intellect of Animals\"):  \"Going to a field or wood at a distance from tame bees with  their box of honey, they gather up from the flowers and imprison one  or more bees, and after they have become sufficiently gorged, let  them out to return to their home with their easily gotten load.  Waiting patiently a longer or shorter time, according to the  distance of the bee-tree, the hunter scarcely ever fails to see the  bee or bees return accompanied by other bees, which are in like  manner imprisoned till they in turn are filled; then one or more are  let out at places distant from each other, and the direction in  which the bee flies noted; and thus, by a kind of triangulation, the  position of the bee-tree proximately ascertained.\"    {47}    You will notice too in your experiments that the friends who appear  to obey the behests of good fortune do not always fly together, and  that there will often be an interval of several seconds between the  different arrivals. As regards these communications, therefore, we  must ask ourselves the question that Sir John Lubbock has solved as  far as the ants are concerned.    Do the comrades who flock to the treasure only follow the bee that  first made the discovery, or have they been sent on by her, and do  they find it through following her indications, her description of  the place where it lies? Between these two hypotheses, that refer  directly to the extent and working of the bee's intellect, there is  obviously an enormous difference. The English savant has succeeded,  by means of an elaborate and ingenious arrangement of gangways,  corridors, moats full of water, and flying bridges, in establishing  that the ants in such cases do no more than follow in the track of  the pioneering insect. With ants, that can be made to pass where one  will, such experiments are possible; but for the bee, whose wings  throw every avenue open, some other expedient must of necessity be  contrived. I imagined the following, which, though it gave no  definite result, might yet, under more favourable conditions, and if  organised more carefully, give rise to definite and satisfactory  conclusions.    My study in the country is on the first floor, above a somewhat  lofty room; sufficiently high, therefore, to be out of the ordinary  range of the bees' flight, except at times when the chestnuts and  lime trees are in bloom. And for more than a week before I started  this experiment I had kept on my table an open comb of honey,  without the perfume having attracted, or induced the visit of, a  single bee. Then I went to a glass hive that was close to the house,  took an Italian bee, brought her to my study, set her on the comb,  and marked her while she was feeding.    When satisfied, she flew away and returned to the hive. I followed,  saw her pass over the surface of the crowd, plunge her head into an  empty cell, disgorge her honey, and prepare to set forth again. At  the door of the hive I had placed a glass box, divided by a trap  into two compartments. The bee flew into this box; and as she was  alone, and no other bee seemed to accompany or follow her, I  imprisoned her and left her there. I then repeated the experiment on  twenty different bees in succession. When the marked bee reappeared  alone, I imprisoned her as I had imprisoned the first. But eight of  them came to the threshold of the hive and entered the box  accompanied by two or three friends. By means of the trap I was able  to separate the marked bee from her companions, and to keep her a  prisoner in the first compartment. Then, having marked her  companions with a different colour, I threw open the second  compartment and set them at liberty, myself returning quickly to my  study to await their arrival. Now it is evident that if a verbal or  magnetic communication had passed, indicating the place, describing  the way, etc., a certain number of the bees, having been furnished  with this information, should have found their way to my room."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#14)"],[1,"believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he  that believeth not shall be damned.\"[19]    The Apostles, inspired by that Divine commission, ceased not to teach  the necessity of baptism, even as long as their ministry endured among  mortals.[20]    The elders of the Church in the present dispensation have been directed  and empowered by the same authority, and almost in the same words:  \"Go ye into all the world, preach the Gospel to every creature,  acting in the authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name  of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and {74} he  that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth  not shall be damned.\"[21] On another occasion the Lord added, in a  revelation through the modern prophet, Joseph Smith: \"Therefore, as  I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every soul who  believeth on your words, and is baptized by water for the remission of  sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost.\" And further, \"Verily, verily, I  say unto you they who believe not on your words, and are not baptized  in water, in my name, for the remission of their sins, that they may  receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my  Father's kingdom, where my Father and I am.\"[22]    _The Gift of the Holy Ghost_ follows baptism by water, and its  authoritative bestowal constitutes the next essential ordinance of the  Gospel.[23] In both ancient and modern times this endowment has been  regarded as a higher baptism, lacking which the baptism of water is  incomplete. John, distinctively known as the Baptist, so taught on the  very eve of our Savior's personal ministry. Consider well his words: \"I  indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after  me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall  baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.\"[24] John testifies  further that the One who should thus inaugurate the higher baptism  was Jesus, Himself. Not until after he had administered the ordinance  of water baptism to Jesus, did John recognize Him as the Christ;  but immediately {75} after that recognition, the Baptist fearlessly  proclaimed his testimony:        \"Behold the Lamb of God * * * This is he of whom I said, After me      cometh a man which is preferred before me * * * And I knew him not:      but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,      Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on      him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[25]    Jesus repeatedly promised the apostles that the \"Comforter\" or the  \"Spirit of Truth\"[26] should be given unto them; and this assurance  was made specific and final immediately prior to the ascension. He  \"commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait  for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the  Holy Ghost not many days hence. * * * Ye shall receive power, after  that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto  me.\"[27] The promise was fulfilled at the succeeding Pentecost when  the apostles received power never before known to them, the endowment  being marked by an outward manifestation of fiery tongues.[28] The  apostles thereafter promised the Holy Ghost to those who sought  salvation. Peter's exhortation to the multitude, on that same memorable  day of Pentecost, is particularly explicit and forceful. In answer to  the inquiry, \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\" the chief of the  apostles replied: {76} \"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the  name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive  the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"[29]    A similar assurance as to the higher endowment of the Holy Ghost  following the ordinance of water-baptism was made by Nephite  prophets,[30] and by the resurrected Christ in His visit to the people  of the western continent.[31] And later still this has been repeated  through the Church in the current dispensation, that of the fulness of  times: \"I say unto you again,\" said the Lord in a revelation to certain  elders of the Church, \"that every soul who believeth on your words, and  is baptized by water for the remission of sins, shall receive the Holy  Ghost.\"[32]    By way of summary let it be repeated: The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints holds as a fundamental doctrine, attested and  proved by scripture both ancient and modern, that compliance with _the  laws and ordinances of the Gospel_ is an absolute and irrevocable  requirement for admission into the Kingdom of God, or in other words,  for the securing of individual salvation to the souls of men, and that  this requirement is universal, applying alike to every soul that has  attained to age and powers of accountability in the flesh, in whatever  period or dispensation that soul has lived in mortality. It follows as  a necessary consequence that if any soul has failed, either through  ignorance or neglect, to render obedience to these requirements, the  obligation is not removed by death.    VICARIOUS SERVICE OF THE LIVING FOR THE DEAD    {77} A question now arises as to how it is possible for the dead to  comply with the terms of the Gospel and do in the spirit what they had  failed to do in the flesh. The exercise of faith and the manifestation  of repentance by disembodied spirits may offer no great difficulty to  human understanding; but that the dead shall obey the ordinances of  the Gospel requiring water-baptism and the baptism of the Spirit by  the authorized laying-on of hands, appears to many as truly impossible  as seemed the new birth to Nicodemus. He listened in amazement to the  Savior's words: \"Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom  of God;\" and asked: \"How can a man be born when he is old? Can he  enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?\" At last he  learned that the new birth referred to was baptism by water and the  baptism of the Spirit. With equal pertinency it may now be asked: How  can a man be baptized when he is dead? Can he enter the second time  into his body of flesh and be immersed in water by human agency? The  answer is that the necessary ordinances may be performed for the dead  by their living representatives, the mortal subject acting as proxy for  the departed one. Thus, even as a man may be baptized in his own person  for himself, he may be baptized as proxy for and in behalf of the dead.    The validity of vicarious service, in which one person acts in  behalf of another, is generally recognized as an element of human  institutions; and that such service may be acceptable unto God is  attested by the written word. Ancient and modern scripture, the  record of {78} history other than sacred, the traditions of tribes  and nations, the rites of bloody sacrifice, and even the sacrificial  abominations of pagan idolatry, involve the essential conception  of vicarious propitiation and of service rendered by proxy. The  scape-goat[33] and the altar victim[34] in the Mosaic dispensation,  when offered by constituted authority and with due accompaniment of  acknowledgment and repentance, were accepted by the Lord as sacrifices  in mitigation of the sins of His people.    The most significant sacrifice of all, the greatest work ever wrought  amongst mankind, the pivotal event in human history, the supreme  achievement which was at once the most glorious consummation and the  most blessed beginning, is the Atonement of Christ; and this was  pre-eminently a vicarious offering. No one who believes that Jesus died  for man can doubt the validity and efficacy of vicarious ministration.  He gave His life as a fore-ordained sacrifice, voluntarily offered and  duly accepted as a propitiation for broken law, and the means by which  salvation was made possible unto man. That His death was literally an  accepted offering in behalf of human kind is thus set forth in the  words of the resurrected Christ, given through modern revelation:        \"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that      they might not suffer if they would repent, but if they would not      repent, they must suffer even as I, which suffering caused myself,      even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to      bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit: and would      that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink--nevertheless,      glory be to the Father, {79} and I partook and finished my      preparations unto the children of men.\"[35]    The vicarious effect of the atonement of Christ is twofold; it has  wrought a universal redemption of all men from the mortal death  incident to the transgression of Adam; and it has provided a means of  propitiation for individual sin whereby the sinner may attain salvation  through obedience. It is by His mortal life and sacrificial death  in behalf of others,--and those others, all who have lived or shall  live,--that Jesus the Christ earned His title, Savior and Redeemer of  mankind. And as He by effort, sacrifice, and suffering, did for men  what they never could accomplish for themselves, and so became in very  truth the one and only Savior and Redeemer of the race, so may each of  us by opening the way to our departed dead whereby they may be brought  within the saving law of the Gospel, become in a small measure saviors  unto those who would otherwise be left in darkness.[36]    In every instance of vicarious ministration, it is an indispensable  requisite that the proxy be worthy and acceptable; and of necessity he  must himself have obeyed the laws and ordinances of the Gospel before  he can officiate in behalf of others. Further, the ministrations of the  living representative must be in accordance with Divine appointment,  and in no wise a merely human assumption. The acceptable sacrifices of  ancient Israel "]]]
