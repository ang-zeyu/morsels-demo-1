As for his features, they seemed kindly  and good humored, and his eyes were turned merrily upon his visitors as  Ozma and Dorothy stood before him with their followers ranged in close  order behind them.    \"Why, he looks just like Santa Claus--only he isn't the same color!\"  whispered Dorothy to her friend; but the Nome King heard the speech,  and it made him laugh aloud.      \"'He had a red face and a round little belly      That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly!'\"      quoth the monarch, in a pleasant voice; and they could all see that he  really did shake like jelly when he laughed.    Both Ozma and Dorothy were much relieved to find the Nome King so  jolly, and a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls each  found a cushioned stool at her side.    \"Sit down, my dears,\" said the King, \"and tell me why you have come all  this way to see me, and what I can do to make you happy.\"    While they seated themselves the Nome King picked up a pipe, and taking  a glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the bowl of the  pipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled in rings above  his head.  Dorothy thought this made the little monarch look more like  Santa Claus than ever; but Ozma now began speaking, and every one  listened intently to her words.    \"Your Majesty,\" said she, \"I am the ruler of the Land of Oz, and I have  come here to ask you to release the good Queen of Ev and her ten  children, whom you have enchanted and hold as your prisoners.\"    \"Oh, no; you are mistaken about that,\" replied the King.  \"They are not  my prisoners, but my slaves, whom I purchased from the King of Ev.\"    \"But that was wrong,\" said Ozma.    \"According to the laws of Ev, the king can do no wrong,\" answered the  monarch, eying a ring of smoke he had just blown from his mouth; \"so  that he had a perfect right to sell his family to me in exchange for a  long life.\"    \"You cheated him, though,\" declared Dorothy; \"for the King of Ev did  not have a long life.  He jumped into the sea and was drowned.\"    \"That was not my fault,\" said the Nome King, crossing his legs and  smiling contentedly.  \"I gave him the long life, all right; but he  destroyed it.\"    \"Then how could it be a long life?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Easily enough,\" was the reply.  \"Now suppose, my dear, that I gave you  a pretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair, and that after you  had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it.  Could you say that I had not given you a pretty doll?\"    \"No,\" answered Dorothy.    \"And could you, in fairness, ask me to return to you the lock of hair,  just because you had smashed the doll?\"    \"No,\" said Dorothy, again.    \"Of course not,\" the Nome King returned.  \"Nor will I give up the Queen  and her children because the King of Ev destroyed his long life by  jumping into the sea.  They belong to me and I shall keep them.\"    \"But you are treating them cruelly,\" said Ozma, who was much distressed  by the King's refusal.    \"In what way?\" he asked.    \"By making them your slaves,\" said she.    \"Cruelty,\" remarked the monarch, puffing out wreathes of smoke and  watching them float into the air, \"is a thing I can't abide.  So, as  slaves must work hard, and the Queen of Ev and her children were  delicate and tender, I transformed them all into articles of ornament  and bric-a-brac and scattered them around the various rooms of my  palace.  Instead of being obliged to labor, they merely decorate my  apartments, and I really think I have treated them with great kindness.\"    \"But what a dreadful fate is theirs!\" exclaimed Ozma, earnestly.  \"And  the Kingdom of Ev is in great need of its royal family to govern it.  If you will liberate them, and restore them to their proper forms, I  will give you ten ornaments to replace each one you lose.\"    The Nome King looked grave.    \"Suppose I refuse?\" he asked.    \"Then,\" said Ozma, firmly, \"I am here with my friends and my army to  conquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes.\"    The Nome King laughed until he choked; and he choked until he coughed;  and he coughed until his face turned from grayish-brown to bright red.  And then he wiped his eyes with a rock-colored handkerchief and grew  grave again.    \"You are as brave as you are pretty, my dear,\" he said to Ozma.  \"But  you have little idea of the extent of the task you have undertaken.  Come with me for a moment.\"    He arose and took Ozma's hand, leading her to a little door at one side  of the room.  This he opened and they stepped out upon a balcony, from  whence they obtained a wonderful view of the Underground World.    A vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain, and in  every direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and Nomes  hammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels.  All  around the walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver and  gold, built into the solid rock, and these extended in rows far away  into the distance, as far as Ozma's eyes could follow them.    While the little maid from Oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene the  Nome King uttered a shrill whistle, and at once all the silver and gold  doors flew open and solid ranks of Nome soldiers marched out from every  one.  So great were their numbers that they quickly filled the immense  underground cavern and forced the busy workmen to abandon their tasks.    Although this tremendous army consisted of rock-colored Nomes, all  squat and fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel,  inlaid with beautiful gems.  Upon his brow each wore a brilliant  electric light, and they bore sharp spears and swords and battle-axes  of solid bronze.  It was evident they were perfectly trained, for they  stood in straight rows, rank after rank, with their weapons held erect  and true, as if awaiting but the word of command to level them upon  their foes.    \"This,\" said the Nome King, \"is but a small part of my army.  No ruler  upon Earth has ever dared to fight me, and no ruler ever will, for I am  too powerful to oppose.\"    He whistled again, and at once the martial array filed through the  silver and gold doorways and disappeared, after which the workmen again  resumed their labors at the furnaces.    Then, sad and discouraged, Ozma of Oz turned to her friends, and the  Nome King calmly reseated himself on his rock throne.    \"It would be foolish for us to fight,\" the girl said to the Tin  Woodman.  \"For our brave Twenty-Seven would be quickly destroyed.  I'm  sure I do not know how to act in this emergency.\"    \"Ask the King where his kitchen is,\" suggested the Tiger.  \"I'm hungry  as a bear.\"    \"I might pounce upon the King and tear him in pieces,\" remarked the  Cowardly Lion.    \"Try it,\" said the monarch, lighting his pipe with another hot coal  which he took from his pocket.    The Lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the Nome King; but he  hopped only a little way into the air and came down again in the same  place, not being able to approach the throne by even an inch.    \"It seems to me,\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully, \"that our best plan  is to wheedle his Majesty into giving up his slaves, since he is too  great a magician to oppose.\"    \"This is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested,\" declared  the Nome King.  \"It is folly to threaten me, but I'm so kind-hearted  that I cannot stand coaxing or wheedling.  If you really wish to  accomplish anything by your journey, my dear Ozma, you must coax me.\"    \"Very well,\" said Ozma, more cheerfully.  \"Let us be friends, and talk  this over in a friendly manner.\"    \"To be sure,\" agreed the King, his eyes twinkling merrily.    \"I am very anxious,\" she continued, \"to liberate the Queen of Ev and  her children who are now ornaments and bric-a-brac in your Majesty's  palace, and to restore them to their people.  Tell me, sir, how this  may be accomplished.\"    The king remained thoughtful for a moment, after which he asked:    \"Are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself, in order to  set free the people of Ev?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Ozma, eagerly.    \"Then,\" said the Nome King, \"I will make you this offer: You shall go  alone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully all that the  rooms contain.  Then you shall have permission to touch eleven  different objects, pronouncing at the time the word 'Ev,' and if any  one of them, or more than one, proves to be the transformation of the  Queen of Ev or any of her ten children, then they will instantly be  restored to their true forms and may leave my palace and my kingdom in  your company, without any objection whatever.  It is possible for you,  in this way, to free the entire eleven; but if you do not guess all the  objects correctly, and some of the slaves remain transformed, then each  one of your friends and followers may, in turn, enter the palace and  have the same privileges I grant you.\"    \"Oh, thank you! thank you for this kind offer!\" said Ozma, eagerly.    \"I make but one condition,\" added the Nome King, his eyes twinkling.    \"What is it?\" she enquired.    \"If none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the  transformation of any of the royal family of Ev, then, instead of  freeing them, you will yourself become enchanted, and transformed into  an article of bric-a-brac or an ornament.  This is only fair and just,  and is the risk you declared you were willing to take.\"          12.  The Eleven Guesses      Hearing this condition imposed by the Nome King, Ozma became silent and  thoughtful, and all her friends looked at her uneasily.    \"Don't you do it!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"If you guess wrong, you will be  enslaved yourself.\"    \"But I shall have eleven guesses,\" answered Ozma.  \"Surely I ought to  guess one object in eleven correctly; and, if I do, I shall rescue one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#14)"],[1,"Ranger Infantry Battalion and the 21st Infantry Regiment,  whether they would be able to meet the target date for Leyte. [126]  Upon receiving affirmative replies, he laconically informed General  Headquarters: \"Sixth Army Forces designated for KING TWO Operations  are ready to meet KING TWO Target Date.\" [127]                  CHAPTER IV    The Return      For more than two years the high command of the Southwest Pacific had  anticipated the promised return to the Philippines. That objective  had governed nearly all of the planning and most of the earlier  invasions. Now the day had arrived. Plans had been made and troops  and cargo were aboard ships. The fleets of the Pacific Ocean Areas  and the Southwest Pacific Area were about to join forces in a mighty  assault against the Philippines.          The Convoy Forms    That part of the VII Amphibious Force which carried the 24th Infantry  Division and the Sixth Army Service Command assembled at the harbor  of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea. In this force were over 470  ships, ranging in size from small rocket-launching craft to 5,000-man  troopships, loaded and now waiting for the message to weigh anchor  and head for the Far Shore, as Leyte was designated. They were  scheduled to pick up that part of the force which was carrying the  1st Cavalry Division from Manus Island and then rendezvous with the  III Amphibious Force.    At 1600 on Friday, the thirteenth of October, the word was given and  the great fleet at Hollandia got under way for the target--Leyte--1,300  miles distant. [128] Minesweeping task groups had preceded it on  11 and 12 October. [129] By sundown the convoy was formed and the  ships were darkened. On 14 October the ships of the convoy crossed  the equator without ceremony. General quarters (battle drill) and  abandon ship drills were held. The part of the force carrying the 1st  Cavalry Division was sighted during the day. On the following day the  two units joined and the convoy proceeded. On 17 October the convoy  made visual contact with the tractor groups of the III Amphibious  Force. This force had come from Hawaii with the XXIV Corps to help  in the liberation of Leyte. [130]        XXIV Corps Afloat    In the early morning hours of 13 September the headquarters  of XXIV Corps at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii, was awake and  active. Breakfast was served at 0330, and all men who had been informed  the day before that they were to embark for an unknown shore shouldered  their barracks bags and carried them to waiting trucks. By 0700 the  men had been loaded on the trucks, which took them to the narrow-gauge  Oahu railroad. In flat cars they traveled some twenty miles to Honolulu  Harbor. The usual seeming delays followed, but eventually the hot,  tired, and perspiring headquarters men boarded the George F. Clymer  and were assigned bunks. The Clymer was but one unit of a large convoy  that stretched toward the horizon in every direction. At 1115 on 15  September the convoy got under way for a destination believed to be  Yap. As the ships departed, word was received that the Yap operation  had been canceled and that Leyte was to be their destination. For  the men on board, life fell into the monotonous routine common to  all transports. Reading, card and dice games, eating, sleeping,  and interminable \"bull sessions\" helped to pass the time.    On the 25th of the month the Clymer anchored at Eniwetok Island,  an anchorage already crowded with hundreds of transports, warships,  and cargo vessels. The men were allowed to go ashore, where they were  given beer and other refreshments. The XXIV Corps was notified that  it would leave for Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, where further  orders would be received and the staging completed. The LST flotilla  left on 26 September and two days later the transports followed. Maps,  terrain studies, and aerial photographs were distributed and studied  en route. [131] At the same time the XXIV Corps issued a tentative  field order which was distributed to lower unit commanders, who then  held conferences and issued tentative verbal field orders. [132]    Early in October the convoy crossed the equator. On many of the ships  ceremonies were held transforming pollywogs into shellbacks, with the  result that some of the men preferred standing to sitting for a few  days. On 3 October the convoy arrived at Manus. [133] The assault  troops of the XXIV Corps were transferred from AKA's to LST's. The  96th Division on 9 October issued a final field order for the Leyte  operation. This order allowed the regimental headquarters less than  forty-eight hours to complete final orders, plans, and maps, and  distribute them to the headquarters of the assault battalions. [134]    On 11 October the LST transports carrying the assault battalions filed  out of the Manus anchorage, and on 14 October the rest of the convoy  again formed and started on the last stretch of the journey. [135]  Its progress was satisfactory, and on 15 October the President of the  United States sent his best wishes for the success of the operation to  President Sergio Osmeña of the Philippine Commonwealth, who was at sea  with the expedition. [136] When the III Amphibious Force rendezvoused  with the Seventh Fleet, the largest convoy ever seen in the Pacific  up to that time was formed. [137]        Composition of the Convoy    Thirty-four months had been spent in building and preparing these  combatant and amphibious vessels. Practically none of them were  in existence at the time Corregidor was besieged. Most of the 183  vessels of Task Force 77 were warships, while Task Forces 78 and 79,  the amphibious forces, consisted mainly of transports, cargo ships,  and a wide variety of landing ships and craft. Fully 518 ocean-going  vessels were included in Task Forces 78 and 79. [138]    Of the vessels assigned to participate in the operation, 157 were  combatant ships: 6 old battleships, 5 heavy cruisers, 6 light cruisers,  18 escort carriers, 86 destroyers, 25 destroyer escorts, and 11  frigates. There were 420 transport vessels, including 5 command ships,  40 attack transports, 10 LSD's, 151 LST's, 79 LCI's, 21 LCT's, and 18  high-speed transports. The remainder included patrol, mine-sweeping,  hydrographic, and service ships. [139]    The convoy did not include the combatant ships of Admiral Halsey's  Third Fleet. The main striking force of the Third Fleet was Task  Force 38, composed of four powerful carrier task groups, under Admiral  Mitscher. Each group contained fast carriers, cruisers, destroyers,  and the newest American battleships. [140]    After forming, the convoy proceeded toward the target. At this time  a disquieting report was received from the meteorologists on board  the ships: a typhoon was headed toward the Leyte Gulf area. Such a  disturbance could be fatal to the expedition. A severe storm did in  fact lash the gulf area from 14 through 17 October, but it gradually  abated and the morning of A Day, 20 October, was clear. This favorable  weather augured well for a successful landing.          Softening the Target    Early Strikes    Allied aircraft had already visited the Philippine Archipelago. The  first aerial strikes since 1942 were made in the early fall of 1944. On  1 September B-24's from New Guinea bases initiated their first  large-scale air attack against airdromes in the Davao area, though  bad weather prevented the protective fighter escort from attacking the  target. The airborne defense encountered was surprisingly light--only  three intercepting fighters opposed the strike. The bombers dropped  100 tons of bombs, destroying 34 planes on the ground and killing  about 100 men. [141] Two American bombers were shot down and six  received minor damages. [142] General MacArthur believed that the  Japanese were conserving their air strength in order to concentrate  it against anticipated Allied landings. [143]    On 4 September the first aerial reconnaissance flights were made over  Leyte. During the period 9-14 September, Admiral Mitscher launched  a large-scale, carrier-based air assault against the Japanese air  defenses in the Philippine Islands in order to protect the Palau and  Morotai landings. On 9 September aircraft from the carriers attacked  airdromes and installations in the Mindanao area, destroying 60  aircraft on the ground and 8 in the air. On 12 September the attack  was directed against the Visayan Islands. Of an estimated air strength  of 225 aircraft in the sector, 125 were destroyed on the ground and  75 in the air. During the night of 12 September the Japanese flew in  reinforcements from Luzon. A Third Fleet strike on 13 September against  the reinforced air strength destroyed an estimated 135 aircraft on  the ground and 81 in the air. On the 14th, the Third Fleet planes  encountered no enemy air opposition but destroyed from 10 to 15  aircraft on the ground. The air strength which the enemy had conserved  for an anticipated American invasion was thus decimated. About 500,  or approximately 57 percent of the 884 aircraft believed to be in the  Philippines, were rendered nonoperational or destroyed. This successful  knocking out of the Japanese air strength in the Philippine Islands  was an important factor in the decision to speed up the landing at  Leyte by two months.    On 21 September Central Pacific carrier-based aircraft directed their  attention to the Luzon area. In spite of their vigorous defense of  the Luzon airfields, the Japanese lost an estimated 110 aircraft in  the air and 95 on the ground. These included not only combat aircraft  but also reconnaissance, transport, and training planes. The remaining  air strength in the area was estimated to be 350 aircraft, of which  10 percent were in Mindanao, 20 percent in the Visayan Islands,  and 70 percent in Luzon.    At the same time, the carrier-based aircraft made strong strikes  against enemy shipping in the central and "]]]
