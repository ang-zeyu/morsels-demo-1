A small party  now left the main body, and moved rapidly towards the object of their  destination.    On reaching the road which led through the bottom of the valley, they  turned their horses' heads to the north.    The Whartons continued chained in breathless silence to the spot,  watching their movements, when the party, having reached the dwelling of  Birch, made a rapid circle around his grounds, and in an instant his  house was surrounded by a dozen sentinels.    Two or three of the dragoons now dismounted and disappeared; in a few  minutes, however, they returned to the yard, followed by Katy, from  whose violent gesticulations, it was evident that matters of no trifling  concern were on the carpet. A short communication with the loquacious  housekeeper followed the arrival of the main body of the troop, and the  advance party remounting, the whole moved towards the Locusts with  great speed.    As yet none of the family had sufficient presence of mind to devise any  means of security for Captain Wharton; but the danger now became too  pressing to admit of longer delay, and various means of secreting him  were hastily proposed; but they were all haughtily rejected by the young  man, as unworthy of his character. It was too late to retreat to the  woods in the rear of the cottage, for he would unavoidably be seen, and,  followed by a troop of horse, as inevitably taken.    At length his sisters, with trembling hands, replaced his original  disguise, the instruments of which had been carefully kept at hand by  Caesar, in expectation of some sudden emergency.    This arrangement was hastily and imperfectly completed, as the dragoons  entered the lawn and orchard of the Locusts, riding with the rapidity of  the wind; and in their turn the Whartons were surrounded.    Nothing remained now, but to meet the impending examination with as much  indifference as the family could assume. The leader of the horse  dismounted, and, followed by a couple of his men, he approached the  outer door of the building, which was slowly and reluctantly opened for  his admission by Caesar. The heavy tread of the trooper, as he followed  the black to the door of the parlor, rang in the ears of the females as  it approached nearer and nearer, and drove the blood from their faces to  their hearts, with a chill that nearly annihilated feeling.    A man, whose colossal stature manifested the possession of vast  strength, entered the room, and removing his cap, he saluted the family  with a mildness his appearance did not indicate as belonging to his  nature. His dark hair hung around his brow in profusion, though stained  with powder which was worn at that day, and his face was nearly hid in  the whiskers by which it was disfigured. Still, the expression of his  eye, though piercing, was not bad, and his voice, though deep and  powerful, was far from unpleasant. Frances ventured to throw a timid  glance at his figure as he entered, and saw at once the man from whose  scrutiny Harvey Birch had warned them there was so much to be  apprehended.    \"You have no cause for alarm, ladies,\" said the officer, pausing a  moment, and contemplating the pale faces around him. \"My business will  be confined to a few questions, which, if freely answered, will  instantly remove us from your dwelling.\"    \"And what may they be, sir?\" stammered Mr. Wharton, rising from his  chair and waiting anxiously for the reply.    \"Has there been a strange gentleman staying with you during the storm?\"  continued the dragoon, speaking with interest, and in some degree  sharing in the evident anxiety of the father.    \"This gentleman--here--favored us with his company during the rain, and  has not yet departed.\"    \"This gentleman!\" repeated the other, turning to Captain Wharton, and  contemplating his figure for a moment until the anxiety of his  countenance gave place to a lurking smile. He approached the youth with  an air of comic gravity, and with a low bow, continued, \"I am sorry for  the severe cold you have in your head, sir.\"    \"I!\" exclaimed the captain, in surprise; \"I have no cold in my head.\"    \"I fancied it then, from seeing you had covered such handsome black  locks with that ugly old wig. It was my mistake; you will please to  pardon it.\"    Mr. Wharton groaned aloud; but the ladies, ignorant of the extent of  their visitor's knowledge, remained in trembling yet rigid silence. The  captain himself moved his hand involuntarily to his head, and discovered  that the trepidation of his sisters had left some of his natural hair  exposed. The dragoon watched the movement with a continued smile, when,  seeming to recollect himself, turning to the father, he proceeded,--    \"Then, sir, I am to understand there has not been a Mr. Harper here,  within the week?\"    \"Mr. Harper,\" echoed the other, feeling a load removed from his heart,  \"yes, I had forgotten; but he is gone; and if there be anything wrong in  his character, we are in entire ignorance of it; to me he was a total  stranger.\"    \"You have but little to apprehend from his character,\" answered the  dragoon dryly. \"But he is gone--how--when--and whither?\"    \"He departed as he arrived,\" said Mr. Wharton, gathering renewed  confidence from the manner of the trooper; \"on horseback, last evening,  and he took the northern road.\"    The officer listened to him with intense interest, his countenance  gradually lighting into a smile of pleasure, and the instant Mr. Wharton  concluded his laconic reply he turned on his heel and left the  apartment. The Whartons, judging from his manner, thought he was about  to proceed in quest of the object of his inquiries. They observed the  dragoon, on gaining the lawn, in earnest and apparently pleased  conversation with his two subalterns. In a few moments orders were given  to some of the troops, and horsemen left the valley, at full speed, by  its various roads.    The suspense of the party within, who were all highly interested  witnesses of this scene, was shortly terminated: for the heavy tread of  the dragoon soon announced his second approach. He bowed again politely  as he reentered the room, and walking up to Captain Wharton, said, with  comic gravity,--    \"Now, sir, my principal business being done, may I beg to examine the  quality of that wig?\"    The British officer imitated the manner of the other, as he deliberately  uncovered his head, and handing him the wig, observed, \"I hope, sir, it  is to your liking.\"    \"I cannot, without violating the truth, say it is,\" returned the  dragoon. \"I prefer your ebony hair, from which you seem to have combed  the powder with great industry. But that must have been a sad hurt you  have received under this enormous black patch.\"    \"You appear so close an observer of things, I should like your opinion  of it, sir,\" said Henry, removing the silk, and exhibiting the cheek  free from blemish.    \"Upon my word, you improve most rapidly in externals,\" added the  trooper, preserving his muscles in inflexible gravity. \"If I could but  persuade you to exchange this old surtout for that handsome blue coat by  your side, I think I never could witness a more agreeable metamorphosis,  since I was changed myself from a lieutenant to a captain.\"    Young Wharton very composedly did as was required and stood an  extremely handsome, well-dressed young man. The dragoon looked at him  for a minute with the drollery that characterized his manner, and then  continued,--    \"This is a newcomer in the scene; it is usual, you know, for strangers  to be introduced; I am Captain Lawton, of the Virginia horse.\"    \"And I, sir, am Captain Wharton, of his Majesty's 60th regiment of  foot,\" returned Henry, bowing stiffly, and recovering his  natural manner.    The countenance of Lawton changed instantly, and his assumed quaintness  vanished. He viewed the figure of Captain Wharton, as he stood proudly  swelling with a pride that disdained further concealment, and exclaimed  with great earnestness,--    \"Captain Wharton, from my soul I pity you!\"    \"Oh! then,\" cried the father in agony, \"if you pity him, dear sir, why  molest him? He is not a spy; nothing but a desire to see his friends  prompted him to venture so far from the regular army in disguise. Leave  him with us; there is no reward, no sum, which I will not  cheerfully pay.\"    \"Sir, your anxiety for your friend excuses your language,\" said Lawton,  haughtily; \"but you forget I am a Virginian, and a gentleman.\" Turning  to the young man, he continued, \"Were you ignorant, Captain Wharton,  that our pickets have been below you for several days?\"    \"I did not know it until I reached them, and it was then too late to  retreat,\" said Wharton sullenly. \"I came out, as my father has  mentioned, to see my friends, understanding your parties to be at  Peekskill, and near the Highlands, or surely I would not have ventured.\"    \"All this may be very true; but the affair of Andre has made us on the  alert. When treason reaches the grade of general officers, Captain  Wharton, it behooves the friends of liberty to be vigilant.\"    Henry bowed to this remark in distant silence, but Sarah ventured to  urge something in behalf of her brother. The dragoon heard her politely,  and apparently with commiseration; but willing to avoid useless and  embarrassing petitions, he answered mildly,--    \"I am not the commander of the party, madam; Major Dunwoodie will decide  what must be done with your brother; at all events he will receive  nothing but kind and gentle treatment.\"    \"Dunwoodie!\" exclaimed Frances, with a face in which the roses contended  for the mastery with the paleness of apprehension. \"Thank God! then  Henry is safe!\"    Lawton regarded her with a mingled expression of pity and admiration;  then shaking his head doubtingly, he continued,--    \"I hope so; and with your permission, we will leave the matter for his  decision.\"    The color of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#14)"],[1,"d:  it is patent to the ear only and eludes the sight: begins and perishes as  it were in a breath.\" Personally I share this view, and I believe firmly  that the written word brings more pleasure than the spoken word.    Plato held the opposite view. He would have agreed with the advice given by  Chesterfield to his son, \"Lay aside the best book when you can go into the  best company--depend upon it you change for the better.\" Plato did, indeed,  characterize books as \"immortal sons deifying their sires.\" But, on the  opposite side, he has that memorable passage, part of which I now quote,  from the same source that has supplied several others of my quotations, Mr.  Alexander Ireland's \"Book-Lover's Enchiridion.\" \"Writing,\" says Plato, \"has  this terrible disadvantage, which puts it on the same footing with  painting. The artist's productions stand before you, as if they were alive:  but if you ask them anything, they keep a solemn silence. Just so with  written discourse: you would fancy it full of the thoughts it speaks: but  if you ask it something that you want to know about what is said, it looks  at you always with the same one sign. And, once committed to writing,  discourse is tossed about everywhere indiscriminately, among those who  understand and those to whom it is naught, and who cannot select the fit  from the unfit.\" Plato further complains, adds Mr. Martineau, that \"Theuth,  the inventor of letters, had ruined men's memories and living command of  their knowledge, by inducing a lazy trust in records ready to their hand:  and he limits the benefit of the _litera scripta_ to the compensation it  provides for the failing memory of old age, when reading naturally becomes  the great solace of life.... Plato's tone is invariably depreciatory of  everything committed to writing, with the exception of laws.\"    This was also the early Rabbinical view, for while the Law might, nay,  must, be written, the rest of the tradition was to be orally confided. The  oral book was the specialty of the Rabbinical schools. We moderns, who are  to the ancients, in Rabbinic phrase, as asses to angels in intellect,  cannot rely upon oral teaching--our memory is too weak to bear the strain.  Even when a student attends an oral lecture, he proves my point, because he  takes notes.    The ideal lies, as usual, in a compromise. Reading profits most when,  beside the book, you have some one with whom to talk about the book. If  that some one be the author of the book, good; if it be your teacher,  better; if it be a fellow-student, better still; if it be members of your  family circle, best of all. The teacher has only succeeded when he feels  that his students can do without him, can use their books by themselves and  for themselves. But personal intercourse in studies between equals is never  obsolete. \"Provide thyself with a fellow-student,\" said the Rabbi.  Friendship made over a book is fast, enduring; this friendship is the great  solace. How much we Jews have lost in modern times in having given up the  old habit of reading good books together in the family circle! Religious  literature thus had a halo of home about it, and the halo never faded  throughout life. From the pages of the book in after years the father's  loving voice still spoke to his child. But when it comes to the author, I  have doubts whether it be at all good to have him near you when you read  his book. You may take an unfair advantage of him, and reject his book,  because you find the writer personally antipathetic. Or he may take an  unfair advantage of you, and control you by his personal fascination. You  remember the critic of Demosthenes, who remarked to him of a certain  oration, \"When I first read your speech, I was convinced, just as the  Athenians were; but when I read it again, I saw through its fallacies.\"  \"Yes,\" rejoined Demosthenes, \"but the Athenians heard it only once.\" A book  you read more than once: for you possess only what you understand. I do not  doubt that the best readers are those who move least in literary circles,  who are unprejudiced one way or the other by their personal likes or  dislikes of literary men. How detestable are personal paragraphs about  authors--often, alas! autobiographical titbits. We expect a little more  reticence: we expect the author to say what he has to say in his book, and  not in his talks about his book and himself. We expect him to express  himself and suppress himself. \"Respect the books,\" says Judah the Pious,  \"or you show disrespect to the writer.\" No, not to the writer, but to the  soul whose progeny the book is, to the living intellect that bred it, in  Milton's noble phrase, to \"an Immortality rather than a life.\" \"Many a  man,\" he says, \"lives a burden to the earth; but a good book is the  precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured up on  purpose to a life beyond life.\"    It is a sober truth that, of the books we chiefly love, we know least about  the authors. Perpetrating probably the only joke in his great Bodleian  Catalogue, Dr. Steinschneider enters the Bible under the heading _Anonyma_.  We are nowadays so concerned to know whether Moses or another wrote the  Pentateuch, that we neglect the Pentateuch as though _no one_ had ever  written it. What do we know about the personality of Shakespeare? Perhaps  we are happy in our ignorance. \"Sometimes,\" said Jonathan Swift, \"I read a  book with pleasure and detest the author.\" Most of us would say the same of  Jonathan Swift himself, and all of us, I think, share R.L. Stevenson's  resentment against a book with the portrait of a living author, and in a  heightened degree against an English translation of an ancient Hebrew  classic with the translator's portrait. Sometimes such a translator _is_  the author; his rendering, at all events, is not the classic. A certain  Fidentinus once stole the work of the Roman poet Martial, and read it out  to the assembly as his own; whereupon Martial wrote this epigram,      The book you read is, Fidentinus, mine,    Tho' read so badly, it well may pass for thine.    But even apart from such bad taste as the aforementioned translator's, I do  not like to see portraits of living authors in their books. The author of a  good book becomes your intimate, but it is the author as you know him from  his book, not as you see him in the flesh or on a silver print. I quote  Stevenson again: \"When you have read, you carry away with you a memory of  the man himself; it is as though you had touched a loyal hand, looked into  brave eyes, and made a noble friend; there is another bond on you  thenceforward, binding you to life and to the love of virtue.\"    This line of thought leads me to the further remark, that some part of  the solace derived from books has changed its character since the art of  printing was invented. In former times the personality, if not of the  author, at all events of the scribe, pressed itself perforce upon the  reader. The reader had before him, not necessarily an autograph, but at  all events a manuscript. Printing has suppressed this individuality, and  the change is not all for the better. The evil consists in this, that  whereas of old a book, being handwritten, was clearly recognized as the  work of some one's hand, it now assumes, being printed, an impersonal  importance, which may be beyond its deserts. Especially is this the case  with what we may term religious authorities; we are now apt to forget  that behind the authority there stands simply--the author. It is  instructive to contrast the customary method of citing two great  codifiers of Jewish law--Maimonides and Joseph Caro. Caro lived in the  age of printing, and the _Shulchan Aruch_ was the first great Jewish  book composed after the printing-press was in operation. The result has  been, that the _Shulchan Aruch_ has become an impersonal authority,  rarely cited by the author's name, while the _Mishneh Torah_ is mostly  referred to as the Rambam, _i.e._ Maimonides.    For all that, printing has been a gain, even from the point of view at  which I have just arrived. Not only has it demolished the barrier which the  scribe's personality interposed between author and reader, but, by  increasing the number of readers, it has added to the solace of each. For  the solace of books is never selfish--the book-miser is never the  book-lover, nor does the mere collector of rarities and preciosities  deserve that name, for the one hoards, but does not own; the other serves  Mammon, not God. The modern cheapening of books--the immediate result of  printing--not only extends culture, it intensifies culture. Your joy in a  book is truest when the book is cheapest, when you know that it is, or  might be, in the hands of thousands of others, who go with you in the  throng towards the same divine joy.    These sentiments are clearly those of a Philistine. The fate of that last  word, by the way, is curious. The Philistines, Mr. Macalistcr discovered  when excavating Gezer, were the only artistic people in Palestine! Using  the term, however, in the sense to which Matthew Arnold gave vogue, I am a  Philistine in taste, I suppose, for I never can bring myself nowadays to  buy a second-hand book. For dusty old tomes, I go to the public library;  but my own private books must be sweet and clean. There are many who prefer  old copies, who revel in the inscribed names of former owners, and prize  their marginal annotations. If there be some special sentimental  associations connected with these factors, if the books be heirlooms, and  the annotations come from a vanished, but beloved, hand, then the old book  becomes an old love. But in most cases these things seem to me the defects  of youth, not the virtues of age; for they are usually too recent to be  venerable, though they are just old enough to disfigure. Let my books be  young, fresh, and fragrant in their virgin purity, unspotted from the  world. If my copy"]]]
