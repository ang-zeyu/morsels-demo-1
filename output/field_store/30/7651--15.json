[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#14)"],[1," dropped into our dusty wake and followed us a few hundred yards,  dragging his packhorse behind him, but a friend made wild and  demonstrative signals from a hotel veranda--hooking at the air in front  with his right hand and jobbing his left thumb over his shoulder in the  direction of the bar--so the drover hauled off and didn't catch up to us  any more. He was a stranger to the entire show.    We walked in twos. There were three twos. It was very hot and dusty;  the heat rushed in fierce dazzling rays across every iron roof and  light-coloured wall that was turned to the sun. One or two pubs closed  respectfully until we got past. They closed their bar doors and the  patrons went in and out through some side or back entrance for a few  minutes. Bushmen seldom grumble at an inconvenience of this sort, when  it is caused by a funeral. They have too much respect for the dead.    On the way to the cemetery we passed three shearers sitting on the shady  side of a fence. One was drunk--very drunk. The other two covered their  right ears with their hats, out of respect for the departed--whoever he  might have been--and one of them kicked the drunk and muttered something  to him.    He straightened himself up, stared, and reached helplessly for his hat,  which he shoved half off and then on again. Then he made a great effort  to pull himself together--and succeeded. He stood up, braced his back  against the fence, knocked off his hat, and remorsefully placed his foot  on it--to keep it off his head till the funeral passed.    A tall, sentimental drover, who walked by my side, cynically quoted  Byronic verses suitable to the occasion--to death--and asked with  pathetic humour whether we thought the dead man's ticket would be  recognized \"over yonder.\" It was a G.L.U. ticket, and the general  opinion was that it would be recognized.    Presently my friend said:    \"You remember when we were in the boat yesterday, we saw a man driving  some horses along the bank?\"    \"Yes.\"    He nodded at the hearse and said \"Well, that's him.\"    I thought awhile.    \"I didn't take any particular notice of him,\" I said. \"He said  something, didn't he?\"    \"Yes; said it was a fine day. You'd have taken more notice if you'd  known that he was doomed to die in the hour, and that those were the  last words he would say to any man in this world.\"    \"To be sure,\" said a full voice from the rear. \"If ye'd known that, ye'd  have prolonged the conversation.\"    We plodded on across the railway line and along the hot, dusty road  which ran to the cemetery, some of us talking about the accident, and  lying about the narrow escapes we had had ourselves. Presently someone  said:    \"There's the Devil.\"    I looked up and saw a priest standing in the shade of the tree by the  cemetery gate.    The hearse was drawn up and the tail-boards were opened. The funeral  extinguished its right ear with its hat as four men lifted the coffin  out and laid it over the grave. The priest--a pale, quiet young  fellow--stood under the shade of a sapling which grew at the head of  the grave. He took off his hat, dropped it carelessly on the ground,  and proceeded to business. I noticed that one or two heathens winced  slightly when the holy water was sprinkled on the coffin. The drops  quickly evaporated, and the little round black spots they left were  soon dusted over; but the spots showed, by contrast, the cheapness and  shabbiness of the cloth with which the coffin was covered. It seemed  black before; now it looked a dusky grey.    Just here man's ignorance and vanity made a farce of the funeral. A  big, bull-necked publican, with heavy, blotchy features, and a supremely  ignorant expression, picked up the priest's straw hat and held it  about two inches over the head of his reverence during the whole of the  service. The father, be it remembered, was standing in the shade. A few  shoved their hats on and off uneasily, struggling between their disgust  for the living and their respect for the dead. The hat had a conical  crown and a brim sloping down all round like a sunshade, and the  publican held it with his great red claw spread over the crown. To  do the priest justice, perhaps he didn't notice the incident. A stage  priest or parson in the same position might have said, \"Put the hat  down, my friend; is not the memory of our departed brother worth more  than my complexion?\" A wattle-bark layman might have expressed himself  in stronger language, none the less to the point. But my priest seemed  unconscious of what was going on. Besides, the publican was a great  and important pillar of the church. He couldn't, as an ignorant  and conceited ass, lose such a good opportunity of asserting his  faithfulness and importance to his church.    The grave looked very narrow under the coffin, and I drew a breath of  relief when the box slid easily down. I saw a coffin get stuck once, at  Rookwood, and it had to be yanked out with difficulty, and laid on the  sods at the feet of the heart-broken relations, who howled dismally  while the grave-diggers widened the hole. But they don't cut contracts  so fine in the West. Our grave-digger was not altogether bowelless,  and, out of respect for that human quality described as \"feelin's,\" he  scraped up some light and dusty soil and threw it down to deaden the  fall of the clay lumps on the coffin. He also tried to steer the first  few shovelfuls gently down against the end of the grave with the back  of the shovel turned outwards, but the hard dry Darling River clods  rebounded and knocked all the same. It didn't matter much--nothing  does. The fall of lumps of clay on a stranger's coffin doesn't sound any  different from the fall of the same things on an ordinary wooden box--at  least I didn't notice anything awesome or unusual in the sound; but,  perhaps, one of us--the most sensitive--might have been impressed by  being reminded of a burial of long ago, when the thump of every sod  jolted his heart.    I have left out the wattle--because it wasn't there. I have also  neglected to mention the heart-broken old mate, with his grizzled head  bowed and great pearly drops streaming down his rugged cheeks. He was  absent--he was probably \"Out Back.\" For similar reasons I have omitted  reference to the suspicious moisture in the eyes of a bearded bush  ruffian named Bill. Bill failed to turn up, and the only moisture was  that which was induced by the heat. I have left out the \"sad Australian  sunset\" because the sun was not going down at the time. The burial took  place exactly at midday.    The dead bushman's name was Jim, apparently; but they found no  portraits, nor locks of hair, nor any love letters, nor anything of that  kind in his swag--not even a reference to his mother; only some papers  relating to Union matters. Most of us didn't know the name till we  saw it on the coffin; we knew him as \"that poor chap that got drowned  yesterday.\"    \"So his name's James Tyson,\" said my drover acquaintance, looking at the  plate.    \"Why! Didn't you know that before?\" I asked.    \"No; but I knew he was a Union man.\"    It turned out, afterwards, that J.T. wasn't his real name--only \"the  name he went by.\" Anyhow he was buried by it, and most of the \"Great  Australian Dailies\" have mentioned in their brevity columns that a young  man named James John Tyson was drowned in a billabong of the Darling  last Sunday.    We did hear, later on, what his real name was; but if we ever chance to  read it in the \"Missing Friends Column,\" we shall not be able to give  any information to heart-broken mother or sister or wife, nor to anyone  who could let him hear something to his advantage--for we have already  forgotten the name.          ON THE EDGE OF A PLAIN      \"I'd been away from home for eight years,\" said Mitchell to his mate,  as they dropped their swags in the mulga shade and sat down. \"I hadn't  written a letter--kept putting it off, and a blundering fool of a fellow  that got down the day before me told the old folks that he'd heard I was  dead.\"    Here he took a pull at his water-bag.    \"When I got home they were all in mourning for me. It was night, and the  girl that opened the door screamed and fainted away like a shot.\"    He lit his pipe.    \"Mother was upstairs howling and moaning in a chair, with all the girls  boo-hoo-ing round her for company. The old man was sitting in the back  kitchen crying to himself.\"    He put his hat down on the ground, dinted in the crown, and poured some  water into the hollow for his cattle-pup.    \"The girls came rushing down. Mother was so pumped out that she couldn't  get up. They thought at first I was a ghost, and then they all tried to  get holt of me at once--nearly smothered me. Look at that pup! You want  to carry a tank of water on a dry stretch when you've got a pup that  drinks as much as two men.\"    He poured a drop more water into the top of his hat.    \"Well, mother screamed and nearly fainted when she saw me. Such a picnic  you never saw. They kept it up all night. I thought the old cove was  gone off his chump. The old woman wouldn't let go my hand for three  mortal hours. Have you got the knife?\"    He cut up some more tobacco.    \"All next day the house was full of neighbours, and the first to come  was an old sweetheart of mine; I never thought she cared for me till  then. Mother and the girls made me swear never to go away any more; and  they kept watching me, and hardly let me go outside for fear I'd--\"    \"Get drunk?\"    \"No--you're smart--for fear I'd clear. At last I swore on the Bible that  I'd never leave home while the old folks were alive; and then mother  seemed easier in her mind.\"    He rolled the pup over and examined his feet. \"I expect I'll have to  carry him a bit--his feet are sore. Well, he's done pretty well this  morning, and anyway he won't drink so much when he's carried.\"    \"You broke your promise about leaving home,\" said his mate."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#14)"],[1,"line is regarded as the  complement.

Portions of the brain may be cut off without producing any pain.  3. The Coliseum was once capable of seating ninety thousand persons.  4. Success generally depends on acting prudently, steadily, and vigorously.  5. You cannot fully sympathize with suffering without having suffered.     (_Suffering_ is here a noun.)

All that rests on the subject line is regarded as the  subject.    +Oral Analysis+.--The phrase _your writing that letter so neatly_ is the  subject; the principal word of it is _writing_, which is completed by  _letter; writing_, as a noun, is modified by _your_, and, as a verb, by the  adverb phrase _so neatly_.    7. We should avoid injuring the feelings of others.  8. My going there will depend upon my father's giving his consent.  9. Good reading aloud is a rare accomplishment.

The bird sitting on the wall is a wren. Lighting_ describes without  restricting; _sitting_ restricts--limits the application of _bird_ to a  particular bird.    +Direction+.--_Justify the punctuation of the participle phrases in Lesson_  37.    +Caution+.--In using a participle, be careful to leave no doubt as to what  you intend it to modify.    +Direction+.--_Correct these errors in arrangement, and punctuate, giving  your reasons:--_    1. A gentleman will let his house going abroad for the summer to a small     family containing all the improvements.  2. The town contains fifty houses and one hundred inhabitants built of     brick.  3. Suits ready made of material cut by an experienced tailor handsomely     trimmed and bought at a bargain are offered cheap.  4. Seated on the topmost branch of a tall tree busily engaged in gnawing an     acorn we espied a squirrel.  5.

Entering the next room was seen a marble statue of Apollo.  2. By giving him a few hints he was prepared to do the work well.  3. Desiring an early start the horse was saddled by five o'clock.    +Direction+.--_Compose sentences in which each of these three participles  shall be used as an adjective modifier, as the principal word in a  prepositional phrase, as the principal word in a phrase used as a subject  or as an object complement, as a mere adjective, as a mere noun, and in an  absolute phrase_:--    Buzzing, leaping, waving.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 40.    VERBS AS NOUNS--INFINITIVES.    +Introductory Hints+.--_I came to see you_. Here the verb _see_, like the  participle, lacks asserting power--_I to see_ asserts nothing. _See_,  following the preposition _to_, [Footnote: For the discussion of _to_ with  the infinitive, see Lesson 134.] names the act and is completed by _you_,  and so does duty as a noun and as a verb. In office it is like the second  kind of participles, described in Lesson 37, and from many grammarians has  received the same name--some calling both _gerunds_, and others calling  both _infinitives_. It differs from this participle in form, and in  following only the preposition _to_. Came _to see_=came _for seeing_.    This form of the verb is frequently the principal word of a phrase used as  a subject or as an object, complement; as, _To read good books_ is  profitable; I like _to read good books_. Here also the form with _to_ is  equivalent to the participle form _reading_. _Reading good books_ is  profitable.    As this form of the verb names the action in an indefinite way, without  limiting it to a subject, we call it the +Infinitive+ (Lat. _infinitus_,  without limit). For definition, see Lesson 131. The infinitive, like the  participle, may have what is called an _assumed subject_. The _assumed  subject_ denotes that to which the action or being expressed by the  participle or the infinitive belongs.    Frequently the infinitive phrase expresses purpose, as in the first example  given above, and in such cases _to_ expresses relation, and performs its  full function as a preposition; but, when the infinitive phrase is used as  subject or as object complement, the _to_ expresses no relation. It serves  only to introduce the phrase, and in no way affects the meaning of the  verb.    The infinitive, like other forms of the verb, may be followed by the  different complements.      Analysis and Parsing.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used as an +adjective modifier+ or an  +adverb modifier+.    1. The hot-house is a trap to catch sunbeams.      hot-house | is \\ trap  ============|================       \\The   |       \\a   \\to                            \\  catch | sunbeams                             \\-------'----------    +Oral Analysis+.--_To_ introduces the phrase; _catch_ is the principal  word, and _sunbeams_ completes it.    +Parsing+.--_To_ is a preposition, introducing the phrase and showing the  relation, in sense, of the principal word to _trap; catch_ is a form of the  verb called _infinitive_; like a noun, it follows the preposition _to_ and  names the action, and, like a verb, it is completed by _sunbeams_.    2. Richelieu's title to command rested on sublime force of will and     decision of character.  3. Many of the attempts to assassinate William the Silent were defeated.  4. We will strive to please you.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase is here used adverbially to modify  the predicate.    5. Ingenious Art steps forth to fashion and refine the race.  6. These harmless delusions tend to make us happy.    +Explanation+.--_Happy_ completes _make_ and relates to _us_.    7. Wounds made by words are hard to heal.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase is here used adverbially to modify  the adjective _hard_. _To heal = to be healed_.    8. The representative Yankee, selling his farm, wanders away to seek new     lands, to clear new cornfields, to build another shingle palace, and     again to sell off and wander.  9. These apples are not ripe enough to eat.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase is here used adverbially to modify  the adverb _enough_. _To eat = to be eaten_.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used as +subject+ or +complement.+    10.
