We have here cases  that are more or less closely allied to the paranoid form of dementia  præcox, other cases that are apparently dependent upon involutional  changes (Kraepelin's _praeseniler Beeinträchtigungswah_), still  other cases that are characterized by absence or at least delay of  mental deterioration, etc.    In some of these cases disturbance of the flow of utterance is not  observed, and the test records obtained from them present no striking  abnormalities. Distinctly pathological records are obtained mainly  from those cases which clinically resemble dementia præcox; in these  records the nature of the pathological reactions would seem to  indicate that the diagnosis of dementia præcox would be more  justifiable than that of paranoic condition.    The following test records will serve to illustrate the types of  reactions met with in this group of psychoses:      CASE No. 3039.--F.A. Normal record.

This has given the former a  healthful stimulus although it is felt only by a picked few. Scores of  records have been established for running, walking, hurdling,  throwing, putting, swimming, rowing, skating, etc., each for various  shorter and longer distances and under manifold conditions, and for  both amateurs and professionals, who are easily accessible. These, in  general, show a slow but steady advance in this country since 1876,  when athletics were established here. In that year there was not a  single world's best record held by an American amateur, and  high-school boys of to-day could in most, though not in all lines,  have won the American championship twenty-five years ago. Of course,  in a strict sense, intercollegiate contests do not show the real  advance in athletics, because it is not necessary for a man in order  to win a championship to do his best; but they do show general  improvement.    We select for our purpose a few of those records longest kept. Not  dependent on external conditions like boat-racing, or on improved  apparatus like bicycling, we have interesting data of a very different  order for physical measurements. These down to present writing--July,  1906--are as follows: For the 100-yard dash, every annual record from  1876 to 1895 is 10 or 11 seconds, or between these, save in 1890,  where Owen's record of 9-4/5 seconds still stands. In the 220-yard run  there is slight improvement since 1877, but here the record of 1896  (Wefers, 21-1/5 seconds) has not been surpassed. In the quarter-mile  run, the beet record was in 1900 (Long, 47 seconds). The half-mile  record, which still stands, was made in 1895 (Kilpatrick, 1 minute  52-2/5 seconds); the mile run in 1895 (Conneff, 4 minutes 15-3/5  seconds). The running broad jump shows a very steady improvement, with  the best record in 1900 (Prinstein, 24 feet 7-1/4 inches). The running  high jump shows improvement, but less, with the record of 1895 still  standing (Sweeney, 6 feet 5-5/8 inches). The record for pole vaulting,  corrected to November, 1905, is 12 feet 132/100 inches (Dole); for  throwing the 16-pound hammer head, 100 feet 5 inches (Queckberner);  for putting the 16-pound shot, 49 feet 6 inches (Coe, 1905); the  standing high jump, 5 feet 5-1/2 inches (Ewry); for the running high  jump, 6 feet 5-5/8 inches (Sweeney). We also find that if we extend  our purview to include all kinds of records for physical achievement,  that not a few of the amateur records for activities involving  strength combined with rapid rhythm movement are held by young men of  twenty or even less.    In putting the 16-pound shot under uniform conditions the record has  improved since the early years nearly 10 feet (Coe, 49 feet 6 inches,  best at present writing, 1906). Pole vaulting shows a very marked  advance culminating in 1904 (Dole, 12 feet 132/100 inches). Most  marked of all perhaps is the great advance in throwing the 16-pound  hammer. Beginning between 70 and 80 feet in the early years, the  record is now 172 feet 11 inches (Flanagan, 1904). The two-mile  bicycle race also shows marked gain, partly, of course, due to  improvement in the wheel, the early records being nearly 7 minutes,  and the best being 2 minutes 19 seconds (McLean, 1903). Some of these  are world records, and more exceed professional records.[3] These, of  course, no more indicate general improvement than the steady reduction  of time in horse-racing suggests betterment in horses generally.    In Panhellenic games as well as at present, athleticism in its  manifold forms was one of the most characteristic expressions of  adolescent nature and needs. Not a single time or distance record of  antiquity has been preserved, although Grasberger[4] and other writers  would have us believe that in those that are comparable, ancient  youthful champions greatly excelled ours, especially in leaping and  running. While we are far from cultivating mere strength, our training  is very one-sided from the Greek norm of unity or of the ideals that  develop the body only for the salve of the soul. While gymnastics in  our sense, with apparatus, exercises, and measurements independently  of games was unknown, the ideal and motive were as different from ours  as was its method. Nothing, so far as is known, was done for  correcting the ravages of work, or for overcoming hereditary defects;  and until athletics degenerated there were Do exercises for the sole  purpose of developing muscle.    On the whole, while modern gymnastics has done more for the trunk,  shoulders, and arms than for the legs, it is now too selfish and  ego-centric, deficient on the side of psychic impulsion, and but  little subordinated to ethical or intellectual development. Yet it  does a great physical service to all who cultivate it, and is a  safeguard of virtue and temperance. Its need is radical revision and  coordination of various cults and theories in the light of the latest  psycho-physiological science.    Gymnastics allies itself to biometric work. The present academic zeal  for physical development is in great need of closer affiliation with  anthropometry. This important and growing department will be  represented in the ideal gymnasium of the future--First, by courses,  if not by a chair, devoted to the apparatus of measurements of human  proportions and symmetry, with a kinesological cabinet where young men  are instructed in the elements of auscultation, the use of calipers,  the sphygmograph, spirometer, plethysmograph, kinesometer to plot  graphic curves, compute average errors, and tables of percentile  grades and in statistical methods, etc. Second, anatomy, especially of  muscles, bones, heart, and skin, will be taught, and also their  physiology, with stress upon myology, the effects of exercise on the  flow of blood and lymph, not excluding the development of the upright  position, and all that it involves and implies. Third, hygiene will be  prominent and comprehensive enough to cover all that pertains to  body-keeping, regimen, sleep, connecting with school and domestic and  public hygiene--all on the basis of modern as distinct from the  archaic physiology of Ling, who, it is sufficient to remember, died in  1839, before this science was recreated, and the persistence of whose  concepts are an anomalous survival to-day. Mechanico-therapeutics, the  purpose and service of each chief kind of apparatus and exercise, the  value of work on stall bars with chest weights, of chinning, use of  the quarter-staff, somersaults, rings, clubs, dumb-bells, work with  straight and flexed knees on machinery, etc., will be taught. Fourth,  the history of gymnastics from the time of its highest development in  Greece to the present is full of interest and has a very high and not  yet developed culture value for youth. This department, both in its  practical and theoretical side, should have its full share of prizes  and scholarships to stimulate the seventy to seventy-five per cent of  students who are now unaffected by the influence of athletics. By  these methods the motivation of gymnastics, which now in large measure  goes to waste in enthusiasm, could be utilised to aid the greatly  needed intellectualization of those exercises which in their nature  are more akin to work than play. Indeed, Gutsmuths's first definition  of athletics was \"work under the garb of youthful pleasure.\" So to  develop these courses that they could chiefly, if not entirely,  satisfy the requirements for the A.B. degree, would coordinate the  work of the now isolated curriculum of the training-schools with that  of the college and thus broaden the sphere of the latter; but besides  its culture value, which I hold very high, such a step would prepare  for the new, important, and, as we have seen, very inadequately manned  profession of physical trainers. This has, moreover, great but yet  latent and even unsuspected capacities for the morals of our academic  youth. Grote states that among the ancient Greeks one-half of all  education as devoted to the body, and Galton urges that they as much  excelled us as we do the African negro. They held that if physical  perfection was cultivated, moral and mental excellence would follow;  and that, without this, national culture rests on an insecure basis.  In our day there are many new reasons to believe that the best nations  of the future will be those which give most intelligent care to the  body.    [Footnote 1: See H.G. Beyer.
