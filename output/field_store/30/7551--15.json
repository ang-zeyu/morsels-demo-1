The 3rd is when the eye is in  front of the object and the light is on one side, in such a way as  that a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object  to the light should form a right angle where they meet.    114.    OF PAINTING.    This is another section: that is, of the nature of a reflection  (from) an object placed between the eye and the light under various  aspects.    115.    OF PAINTING.    As regards all visible objects 3 things must be considered. These  are the position of the eye which sees: that of the object seen  [with regard] to the light, and the position of the light which  illuminates the object, _b_ is the eye, _a_ the object seen, _c_ the  light, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the illuminating body, _c_ is the  illuminated object.    116.    Let _a_ be the light, _b_ the eye, _c_ the object seen by the eye  and in the light. These show, first, the eye between the light and  the body; the 2nd, the light between the eye and the body; the 3rd  the body between the eye and the light, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the  illuminated object, _c_ the light.    117.    OF PAINTING.    OF THE THREE KINDS OF LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATE OPAQUE BODIES.    The first kind of Light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called  Direct light--as that of the sun or any other light from a window or  flame. The second is Diffused [universal] light, such as we see in  cloudy weather or in mist and the like. The 3rd is Subdued light,  that is when the sun is entirely below the horizon, either in the  evening or morning.    118.    OF LIGHT.    The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These  are: diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon.  And Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other  opening. The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is  that which passes through [semi] transparent bodies, as linen or  paper or the like, but not transparent like glass, or crystal, or  other diaphanous bodies, which produce the same effect as though  nothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that  falls upon it; and this we will discuss fully in our discourse.    Definition of the nature of shadows (119--122).    119.    WHAT LIGHT AND SHADOW ARE.    Shadow is the absence of light, merely the obstruction of the  luminous rays by an opaque body. Shadow is of the nature of  darkness. Light [on an object] is of the nature of a luminous body;  one conceals and the other reveals. They are always associated and  inseparable from all objects. But shadow is a more powerful agent  than light, for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their  light, while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body, that  is from an opaque body.    120.    Shadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque  body. Shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut  off by an opaque body.    This is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size  as the luminous rays were which are transformed into a shadow.    121.    Shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness, and stands  between darkness and light.    A shadow may be infinitely dark, and also of infinite degrees of  absence of darkness.    The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness  and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is  the means by which bodies display their form.    The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for  shadow.    122.    OF THE NATURE OF SHADOW.    Shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter. All such matters  are more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the  end, I say at the beginning, whatever their form or condition may be  and whether visible or invisible. And it is not from small  beginnings that they grow to a great size in time; as it might be a  great oak which has a feeble beginning from a small acorn. Yet I may  say that the oak is most powerful at its beginning, that is where it  springs from the earth, which is where it is largest (To return:)  Darkness, then, is the strongest degree of shadow and light is its  least. Therefore, O Painter, make your shadow darkest close to the  object that casts it, and make the end of it fading into light,  seeming to have no end.    Of the various kinds of shadows. (123-125).    123.    Darkness is absence of light. Shadow is diminution of light.  Primitive shadow is that which is inseparable from a body not in the  light. Derived shadow is that which is disengaged from a body in  shadow and pervades the air. A cast transparent shadow is that which  is surrounded by an illuminated surface. A simple shadow is one  which receives no light from the luminous body which causes it. A  simple shadow begins within the line which starts from the edge of  the luminous body _a b_.    124.    A simple shadow is one where no light at all interferes with it.    A compound shadow is one which is somewhat illuminated by one or  more lights.    125.    WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHADOW THAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM A  BODY AND A CAST SHADOW?    An inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the  illuminated body. As, for instance a ball, which so long as it is in  the light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for  any movement or change of position in the ball. A separate shadow  may be and may not be produced by the body itself. Suppose the ball  to be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite  side of it; this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a  shadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned  towards the wall. That portion of the cast shadow will not be  visible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up  towards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost.    126.    HOW THERE ARE 2 KINDS OF LIGHT, ONE SEPARABLE FROM, AND THE OTHER  INSEPARABLE FROM BODIES.    Of the various kinds of light (126, 127).    Separate light is that which falls upon the body. Inseparable light  is the side of the body that is illuminated by that light. One is  called primary, the other derived. And, in the same way there are  two kinds of shadow:--One primary and the other derived. The primary  is that which is inseparable from the body, the derived is that  which proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall  the form of the body causing it.    127.    How there are 2 different kinds of light; one being called diffused,  the other restricted. The diffused is that which freely illuminates  objects. The restricted is that which being admitted through an  opening or window illuminates them on that side only.    [Footnote: At the spot marked _A_ in the first diagram Leonardo  wrote _lume costretto_ (restricted light). At the spot _B_ on the  second diagram he wrote _lume libero_ (diffused light).]    General remarks (128. 129).    128.    Light is the chaser away of darkness. Shade is the obstruction of  light. Primary light is that which falls on objects and causes light  and shade. And derived lights are those portions of a body which are  illuminated by the primary light. A primary shadow is that side of a  body on which the light cannot fall.    The general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of  the rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through  the air without any interference and the spot which intercepts and  cuts off the distribution of the dark and light rays.    And the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is  placed between the shaded and the illuminated parts.    129.    MEMORANDUM OF THINGS I REQUIRE TO HAVE GRANTED [AS AXIOMS] IN MY  EXPLANATION OF PERSPECTIVE.    I ask to have this much granted me--to assert that every ray  passing through air of equal density throughout, travels in a  straight line from its cause to the object or place it falls upon.    FIRST BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    On the nature of light (130. 131).    130.    The reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single  centre is this: We plainly see that a large light is often much  broader than some small object which nevertheless--and although the  rays [of the large light] are much more than twice the extent [of  the small body]--always has its shadow cast on the nearest surface  very visibly. Let _c f_ be a broad light and _n_ be the object in  front of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let _a b_ be the  plane. It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the  shadow _n_ on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre  is shown by this experiment. The shadow falls on the plane as is  shown at _m o t r_.    [Footnote 13: In the original MS. no explanatory text is placed  after this title-line; but a space is left for it and the text  beginning at line 15 comes next.] Why, to two [eyes] or in front of  two eyes do 3 objects appear as two?    Why, when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights  the nearer appears confused. I say that the eye projects an infinite  number of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to  it from the object looked at. And it is only the central and  sensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects;  all the others are false and illusory. And if you place 2 objects at  half an arm's length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the  eye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second;  the reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of  false lines than the second and so is rendered vague.    Light acts in the same manner, for in the effects of its lines  (=rays), and particularly in perspective, it much resembles the eye;  and its central rays are what cast the true shadow.

He looked out of the window. Evidently this was at the  end of the house.  There was a flagstone walk, beside which ran a ditch  full of swift, muddy water.  It made a pleasant sound.  There were  trees strange of form and color to to him.  He heard bees, birds,  chickens, saw the red of roses and green of grass.  Then he saw, close  to the wall, a tub full of water, and a bench upon which lay basin,  soap, towel, comb, and brush.  The window was also a door, for under it  there was a step.    Gale hesitated a moment, then went out.  He stepped naturally, hoping  and expecting that the cowboys would hear him.  But nobody came.  Awkwardly, with left hand, he washed his face.  Upon a nail in the wall  hung a little mirror, by the aid of which Dick combed and brushed his  hair.  He imagined he looked a most haggard wretch.  With that he faced  forward, meaning to go round the corner of the house to greet the  cowboys and these new-found friends.    Dick had taken but one step when he was halted by laugher and the  patter of light feet.    From close around the corner pealed out that sweet voice.  \"Dad, you'll  have your wish, and mama will be wild!\"    Dick saw a little foot sweep into view, a white dress, then the swiftly  moving form of a girl.  She was looking backward.    \"Dad, I shall fall in love with your new ranger.  I will--I have--\"    Then she plumped squarely into Dick's arms.    She started back violently.    Dick saw a fair face and dark-blue, audaciously flashing eyes. Swift as  lightning their expression changed to surprise, fear, wonder.  For an  instant they were level with Dick's grave questioning. Suddenly,  sweetly, she blushed.    \"Oh-h!\" she faltered.    Then the blush turned to a scarlet fire.  She whirled past him, and  like a white gleam was gone.    Dick became conscious of the quickened beating of his heart.  He  experienced a singular exhilaration.  That moment had been the one for  which he had been ripe, the event upon which strange circumstances had  been rushing him.    With a couple of strides he turned the corner.  Laddy and Lash were  there talking to a man of burly form.  Seen by day, both cowboys were  gray-haired, red-skinned, and weather-beaten, with lean, sharp  features, and gray eyes so much alike that they might have been  brothers.    \"Hello, there's the young fellow,\" spoke up the burly man.  \"Mr. Gale,  I'm glad to meet you.  My name's Belding.\"    His greeting was as warm as his handclasp was long and hard. Gale saw a  heavy man of medium height.  His head was large and covered with  grizzled locks.  He wore a short-cropped mustache and chin beard.  His  skin was brown, and his dark eyes beamed with a genial light.    The cowboys were as cordial as if Dick had been their friend for years.    \"Young man, did you run into anything as you came out?\" asked Belding,  with twinkling eyes.    \"Why, yes, I met something white and swift flying by,\" replied Dick.    \"Did she see you?\" asked Laddy.    \"I think so; but she didn't wait for me to introduce myself.\"    \"That was Nell Burton, my girl--step-daughter, I should say,\" said  Belding.  \"She's sure some whirlwind, as Laddy calls her.  Come, let's  go in and meet the wife.\"    The house was long, like a barracks, with porch extending all the way,  and doors every dozen paces.  When Dick was ushered into a  sitting-room, he was amazed at the light and comfort.  This room had  two big windows and a door opening into a patio, where there were  luxuriant grass, roses in bloom, and flowering trees.  He heard a slow  splashing of water.    In Mrs. Belding, Gale found a woman of noble proportions and striking  appearance.  Her hair was white.  She had a strong, serious, well-lined  face that bore haunting evidences of past beauty.  The gaze she bent  upon him was almost piercing in its intensity.  Her greeting, which  seemed to Dick rather slow in coming, was kind though not cordial.  Gale's first thought, after he had thanked these good people for their  hospitality, was to inquire about Mercedes.  He was informed that the  Spanish girl had awakened with a considerable fever and nervousness.  When, however, her anxiety had been allayed and her thirst relieved,  she had fallen asleep again.  Mrs. Belding said the girl had suffered  no great hardship, other than mental, and would very soon be rested and  well.    \"Now, Gale,\" said Belding, when his wife had excused herself to get  supper, \"the boys, Jim and Laddy, told me about you and the mix-up at  Casita.  I'll be glad to take care of the girl till it's safe for your  soldier friend to get her out of the country.  That won't be very soon,  don't mistake me.... I don't want to seem over-curious about you--Laddy  has interested me in you--and straight out I'd like to know what you  propose to do now.\"    \"I haven't any plans,\" replied Dick; and, taking the moment as  propitious, he decided to speak frankly concerning himself.  \"I just  drifted down here.  My home is in Chicago.  When I left school some  years ago--I'm twenty-five now--I went to work for my father. He's--he  has business interests there.  I tried all kinds of inside jobs.  I  couldn't please my father.  I guess I put no real heart in my work.  The fact was I didn't know how to work.  The governor and I didn't  exactly quarrel; but he hurt my feelings, and I quit. Six months or  more ago I came West, and have knocked about from Wyoming southwest to  the border.  I tried to find congenial work, but nothing came my way.  To tell you frankly, Mr. Belding, I suppose I didn't much care.  I  believe, though, that all the time I didn't know what I wanted.  I've  learned--well, just lately--\"    \"What do you want to do?\" interposed Belding.    \"I want a man's job.  I want to do things with my hands.  I want  action.  I want to be outdoors.\"    Belding nodded his head as if he understood that, and he began to speak  again, cut something short, then went on, hesitatingly:    \"Gale--you could go home again--to the old man--it'd be all right?\"    \"Mr. Belding, there's nothing shady in my past.  The governor would be  glad to have me home.  That's the only consolation I've got. But I'm  not going.  I'm broke.  I won't be a tramp.  And it's up to me to do  something.\"    \"How'd you like to be a border ranger?\" asked Belding, laying a hand on  Dick's knee.  \"Part of my job here is United States Inspector of  Immigration.  I've got that boundary line to patrol--to keep out Chinks  and Japs.  This revolution has added complications, and I'm looking for  smugglers and raiders here any day.  You'll not be hired by the U. S.  You'll simply be my ranger, same as Laddy and Jim, who have promised to  work for me.  I'll pay you well, give you a room here, furnish  everything down to guns, and the finest horse you ever saw in your  life.  Your job won't be safe and healthy, sometimes, but it'll be a  man's job--don't mistake me! You can gamble on having things to do  outdoors.  Now, what do you say?\"    \"I accept, and I thank you--I can't say how much,\" replied Gale,  earnestly.    \"Good!  That's settled.  Let's go out and tell Laddy and Jim.\"    Both boys expressed satisfaction at the turn of affairs, and then with  Belding they set out to take Gale around the ranch.  The house and  several outbuildings were constructed of adobe, which, according to  Belding, retained the summer heat on into winter, and the winter cold  on into summer.  These gray-red mud habitations were hideous to look  at, and this fact, perhaps, made their really comfortable interiors  more vividly a contrast.  The wide grounds were covered with luxuriant  grass and flowers and different kinds of trees.  Gale's interest led  him to ask about fig trees and pomegranates, and especially about a  beautiful specimen that Belding called palo verde.    Belding explained that the luxuriance of this desert place was owing to  a few springs and the dammed-up waters of the Rio Forlorn. Before he  had come to the oasis it had been inhabited by a Papago Indian tribe  and a few peon families.  The oasis lay in an arroyo a mile wide, and  sloped southwest for some ten miles or more. The river went dry most of  the year; but enough water was stored in flood season to irrigate the  gardens and alfalfa fields.    \"I've got one never-failing spring on my place,\" said Belding.  \"Fine,  sweet water!  You know what that means in the desert.  I like this  oasis.  The longer I live here the better I like it.  There's not a  spot in southern Arizona that'll compare with this valley for water or  grass or wood.  It's beautiful and healthy.  Forlorn and lonely, yes,  especially for women like my wife and Nell; but I like it.... And  between you and me, boys, I've got something up my sleeve.  There's  gold dust in the arroyos, and there's mineral up in the mountains. If  we only had water!  This hamlet has steadily grown since I took up a  station here.  Why, Casita is no place beside Forlorn River. Pretty  soon the Southern Pacific will shoot a railroad branch out here.  There  are possibilities, and I want you boys to stay with me and get in on  the ground floor.  I wish this rebel war was over.... Well, here are  the corrals and the fields.  Gale, take a look at that bunch of horses!\"    Belding's last remark was made as he led his companions out of shady  gardens into the open.  Gale saw an adobe shed and a huge pen fenced by  strangely twisted and contorted branches or trunks of mesquite, and,  beyond these, wide, flat fields, green--a dark, rich green--and dotted  with beautiful horses.  There were whites and blacks, and bays and  grays.  In his admiration Gale searched his memory to see if he could  remember the like of these magnificent animals, and had to admit that  the only ones he could compare with them were the Arabian steeds.    \"Every ranch loves his horses,\" said Belding.  \"When I was in the  Panhandle"]]]
