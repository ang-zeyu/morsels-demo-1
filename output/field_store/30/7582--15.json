A missile hurtled past my nose, and I saw a  rotten cabbage envelop the baldish head of the ex-deportee. Someone  reached out a long arm and grabbed a chair, and with it took the legs  from Gresson. Then the lights suddenly went out, and we retreated in  good order by the platform door with a yelling crowd at our heels.    It was here that the plain-clothes men came in handy. They held the  door while the ex-deportee was smuggled out by some side entrance. That  class of lad would soon cease to exist but for the protection of the  law which he would abolish. The rest of us, having less to fear, were  suffered to leak into Newmilns Street. I found myself next to Gresson,  and took his arm. There was something hard in his coat pocket.    Unfortunately there was a big lamp at the point where we emerged, and  there for our confusion were the Fusilier jocks. Both were strung to  fighting pitch, and were determined to have someone's blood. Of me they  took no notice, but Gresson had spoken after their ire had been roused,  and was marked out as a victim. With a howl of joy they rushed for him.    I felt his hand steal to his side-pocket. 'Let that alone, you fool,' I  growled in his ear.    'Sure, mister,' he said, and the next second we were in the thick of it.    It was like so many street fights I have seen--an immense crowd which  surged up around us, and yet left a clear ring. Gresson and I got  against the wall on the side-walk, and faced the furious soldiery. My  intention was to do as little as possible, but the first minute  convinced me that my companion had no idea how to use his fists, and I  was mortally afraid that he would get busy with the gun in his pocket.  It was that fear that brought me into the scrap. The jocks were  sportsmen every bit of them, and only one advanced to the combat. He  hit Gresson a clip on the jaw with his left, and but for the wall would  have laid him out. I saw in the lamplight the vicious gleam in the  American's eye and the twitch of his hand to his pocket. That decided  me to interfere and I got in front of him.    This brought the second jock into the fray. He was a broad, thickset  fellow, of the adorable bandy-legged stocky type that I had seen go  through the Railway Triangle at Arras as though it were blotting-paper.  He had some notion of fighting, too, and gave me a rough time, for I  had to keep edging the other fellow off Gresson.    'Go home, you fool,' I shouted. 'Let this gentleman alone. I don't want  to hurt you.'    The only answer was a hook-hit which I just managed to guard, followed  by a mighty drive with his right which I dodged so that he barked his  knuckles on the wall. I heard a yell of rage, and observed that Gresson  seemed to have kicked his assailant on the shin. I began to long for  the police.    Then there was that swaying of the crowd which betokens the approach of  the forces of law and order. But they were too late to prevent trouble.  In self-defence I had to take my jock seriously, and got in my blow  when he had overreached himself and lost his balance. I never hit  anyone so unwillingly in my life. He went over like a poled ox, and  measured his length on the causeway.    I found myself explaining things politely to the constables. 'These men  objected to this gentleman's speech at the meeting, and I had to  interfere to protect him. No, no! I don't want to charge anybody. It  was all a misunderstanding.' I helped the stricken jock to rise and  offered him ten bob for consolation.    He looked at me sullenly and spat on the ground. 'Keep your dirty  money,' he said. 'I'll be even with ye yet, my man--you and that  red-headed scab. I'll mind the looks of ye the next time I see ye.'    Gresson was wiping the blood from his cheek with a silk handkerchief.  'I guess I'm in your debt, Mr Brand,' he said. 'You may bet I won't  forget it.'                *       *       *       *       *    I returned to an anxious Amos. He heard my story in silence and his  only comment was--'Well done the Fusiliers!'    'It might have been worse, I'll not deny,' he went on. 'Ye've  established some kind of a claim upon Gresson, which may come in handy  ... Speaking about Gresson, I've news for ye. He's sailing on Friday as  purser in the _Tobermory_. The _Tobermory's_ a boat that wanders every  month up the West Highlands as far as Stornoway. I've arranged for ye  to take a trip on that boat, Mr Brand.'    I nodded. 'How did you find out that?' I asked.    'It took me some finding,' he said dryly, 'but I've ways and means. Now  I'll not trouble ye with advice, for ye ken your job as well as me. But  I'm going north myself the morn to look after some of the Ross-shire  wuds, and I'll be in the way of getting telegrams at the Kyle. Ye'll  keep that in mind. Keep in mind, too, that I'm a great reader of the  _Pilgrim's Progress_ and that I've a cousin of the name of Ochterlony.'        CHAPTER FIVE    Various Doings in the West    The _Tobermory_ was no ship for passengers. Its decks were littered  with a hundred oddments, so that a man could barely walk a step without  tacking, and my bunk was simply a shelf in the frowsty little saloon,  where the odour of ham and eggs hung like a fog. I joined her at  Greenock and took a turn on deck with the captain after tea, when he  told me the names of the big blue hills to the north. He had a fine old  copper-coloured face and side-whiskers like an archbishop, and, having  spent all his days beating up the western seas, had as many yarns in  his head as Peter himself.    'On this boat,' he announced, 'we don't ken what a day may bring forth.  I may put into Colonsay for twa hours and bide there three days. I get  a telegram at Oban and the next thing I'm awa ayont Barra. Sheep's the  difficult business. They maun be fetched for the sales, and they're  dooms slow to lift. So ye see it's not what ye call a pleasure trip,  Maister Brand.'    Indeed it wasn't, for the confounded tub wallowed like a fat sow as  soon as we rounded a headland and got the weight of the south-western  wind. When asked my purpose, I explained that I was a colonial of Scots  extraction, who was paying his first visit to his fatherland and wanted  to explore the beauties of the West Highlands. I let him gather that I  was not rich in this world's goods.    'Ye'll have a passport?' he asked. 'They'll no let ye go north o' Fort  William without one.'    Amos had said nothing about passports, so I looked blank.    'I could keep ye on board for the whole voyage,' he went on, 'but ye  wouldna be permitted to land. If ye're seekin' enjoyment, it would be a  poor job sittin' on this deck and admirin' the works o' God and no  allowed to step on the pier-head. Ye should have applied to the  military gentlemen in Glesca. But ye've plenty o' time to make up your  mind afore we get to Oban. We've a heap o' calls to make Mull and Islay  way.'    The purser came up to inquire about my ticket, and greeted me with a  grin.    'Ye're acquaint with Mr Gresson, then?' said the captain. 'Weel, we're  a cheery wee ship's company, and that's the great thing on this kind o'  job.'    I made but a poor supper, for the wind had risen to half a gale, and I  saw hours of wretchedness approaching. The trouble with me is that I  cannot be honestly sick and get it over. Queasiness and headache beset  me and there is no refuge but bed. I turned into my bunk, leaving the  captain and the mate smoking shag not six feet from my head, and fell  into a restless sleep. When I woke the place was empty, and smelt  vilely of stale tobacco and cheese. My throbbing brows made sleep  impossible, and I tried to ease them by staggering upon deck. I saw a  clear windy sky, with every star as bright as a live coal, and a  heaving waste of dark waters running to ink-black hills. Then a douche  of spray caught me and sent me down the companion to my bunk again,  where I lay for hours trying to make a plan of campaign.    I argued that if Amos had wanted me to have a passport he would have  provided one, so I needn't bother my head about that. But it was my  business to keep alongside Gresson, and if the boat stayed a week in  some port and he went off ashore, I must follow him. Having no passport  I would have to be always dodging trouble, which would handicap my  movements and in all likelihood make me more conspicuous than I wanted.  I guessed that Amos had denied me the passport for the very reason that  he wanted Gresson to think me harmless. The area of danger would,  therefore, be the passport country, somewhere north of Fort William.    But to follow Gresson I must run risks and enter that country. His  suspicions, if he had any, would be lulled if I left the boat at Oban,  but it was up to me to follow overland to the north and hit the place  where the _Tobermory_ made a long stay. The confounded tub had no  plans; she wandered about the West Highlands looking for sheep and  things; and the captain himself could give me no time-table of her  voyage. It was incredible that Gresson should take all this trouble if  he did not know that at some place--and the right place--he would have  time to get a spell ashore. But I could scarcely ask Gresson for that  information, though I determined to cast a wary fly over him. I knew  roughly the _Tobermory's_ course--through the Sound of Islay to  Colonsay; then up the east side of Mull to Oban; then through the Sound  of Mull to the islands with names like cocktails, Rum and Eigg and  Coll; then to Skye; and then for the Outer Hebrides. I thought the last  would be the place, and it seemed madness to leave the boat, for the  Lord knew how I should get across the Minch. This consideration upset  all my plans again, and I fell into a troubled sleep without coming to  any conclusion.

[page 63]    action of light; and if any enters even temporarily on one side, they  merely bend to this side in slightly zigzag lines. Of the three tracings  one alone (Fig. 49) is here given. Had the observations been more frequent  during the 12 h. two oval figures would have been described with their  longer axes at right angles to one another. The actual amount of movement  of the apex from side to side was about .3 of an inch. The figures  described by the other two seedlings resembled to a certain extent the one  here given.    Fig. 49. Phalaris Canariensis: circumnutation of a cotyledon, with a mark  placed below the apex, traced on a horizontal glass, from 8.35 A.M. Nov.  26th to 8.45 A.M. 27th. Movement of apex magnified 7 times, here reduced to  one-half scale.    A seedling which had just broken through the ground and projected only  1/20th of an inch above the surface, was next observed in the same manner  as before. It was necessary to clear away the earth all round the seedling  to a little depth in order to place a mark beneath the apex. The figure  (Fig. 50) shows that the apex moved to one side, but changed its course ten  times in the course of the ten hours of observation; so that there can be  no doubt about its circumnutation. The cause of the general movement in one  direction could hardly be attributed to the entrance of lateral light, as  this was carefully guarded against; and we suppose it was in some manner  connected with the removal of the earth round the little seedling.    Fig. 50. Phalaris Canariensis: circumnutation of a very young cotyledon,  with a mark placed below the apex, traced on a horizontal glass, from 11.37  A.M. to 9.30 P.M. Dec. 13th. Movement of apex greatly magnified, here  reduced to one-fourth of original scale.    Lastly, the soil in the same pot was searched with the aid of a lens, and  the white knife-like apex of a seedling was found on an exact level with  that of the surrounding surface. The soil was removed all round the apex to  the depth of a quarter of an inch, the seed itself remaining covered. The  pot, protected from lateral light, was placed under the micro-  [page 64]  scope with a micrometer eye-piece, so arranged that each division equalled  1/500th of an inch. After an interval of 30 m. the apex was observed, and  it was seen to cross a little obliquely two divisions of the micrometer in  9 m. 15 s.; and after a few minutes it crossed the same space in 8 m. 50s.  The seedling was again observed after an interval of three-quarters of an  hour, and now the apex crossed rather obliquely two divisions in 10 m. We  may therefore conclude that it was travelling at about the rate of 1/50th  of an inch in 45 minutes. We may also conclude from these and the previous  observations, that the seedlings of Phalaris in breaking through the  surface of the soil circumnutate as much as the surrounding pressure will  permit. This fact accounts (as in the case before given of the asparagus)  for a circular, narrow, open space or crack being distinctly visible round  several seedlings which had risen through very fine argillaceous sand, kept  uniformly damp.    Fig. 51. Zea mays: circumnutation of cotyledon, traced on horizontal glass,  from 8.30 A.M. Feb. 4th to 8 A.M. 6th. Movement of bead magnified on an  average about 25 times.    Zea mays (Gramineae).--A glass filament was fixed obliquely to the summit  of a cotyledon, rising .2 of an inch above the ground; but by the third  morning it had grown to exactly thrice this height, so that the distance of  the bead from the mark below was greatly increased, consequently the  tracing (Fig. 51) was much more magnified on the first than on the second  day. The upper part of the cotyledon changed its course by at least as much  as a rectangle six times on each of the two days. The plant was illuminated  by an obscure light from vertically above. This was a necessary precaution,  as on the previous day we had traced the movements of cotyledons placed in  a deep box, the inner side of which was feebly illuminated on one side from  a distant north-east window, and at each observation by a wax taper held  for a minute or two on the same side; and the result was that the  cotyledons travelled all day long to this side, though making in their  course some conspicuous flexures, from which fact alone we might have  [page 65]  concluded that they were circumnutating; but we thought it advisable to  make the tracing above given.    Radicles.--Glass filaments were fixed to two short radicles, placed so as  to stand almost upright, and whilst bending downwards through geotropism  their courses were strongly zigzag; from this latter circumstance  circumnutation might have been inferred, had not their tips become slightly  withered after the first 24 h., though they were watered and the air kept  very damp. Nine radicles were next arranged in the manner formerly  described, so that in growing downwards they left tracks on smoked  glass-plates, inclined at various angles between 45o and 80o beneath the  horizon. Almost every one of these tracks offered evidence in their greater  or less breadth in different parts, or in little bridges of soot being  left, that the apex had come alternately into more and less close contact  with the glass. In the accompanying figure (Fig. 52) we have an accurate  copy of one such track. In two instances alone (and in these the plates  were highly inclined) there was some evidence of slight lateral movement.  We presume therefore that the friction of the apex on the smoked surface,  little as this could have been, sufficed to check the movement from side to  side of these delicate radicles.    Fig. 52. Zea mays: track left on inclined smoked glass-plate by tip of  radicle in growing downwards.    Avena sativa (Gramineae).--A cotyledon, 1 ½ inch in height, was placed in  front of a north-east window, and the movement of the apex was traced on a  horizontal glass during two days. It moved towards the light in a slightly  zigzag line from 9 to 11.30 A.M. on October 15th; it then moved a little  backwards and zigzagged much until 5 P.M., after which hour, and curing the  night, it continued to move towards the window. On the following morning  the same movement was continued in a nearly straight line until 12.40 P.M.,  when the sky remained until 2.35 extraordinarily dark from thunder-clouds.  During this interval of 1 h. 55 m., whilst the light was obscure, it was  interesting to observe how circumnutation overcame heliotropism, for the  apex, instead of continuing to move towards the window in a slightly zigzag  line, reversed its course four times, making two small narrow ellipses. A  diagram of this case will be given in the chapter on Heliotropism.  [page 66]    A filament was next fixed to a cotyledon only 1/4 of an inch in height,  which was illuminated exclusively from above, and as it was kept in a warm  greenhouse, it grew rapidly; and now there could be no doubt about its  circumnutation, for it described a figure of 8 as well as two small  ellipses in 5 ½ hours.    Nephrodium molle (Filices).--A seedling fern of this species came up by  chance in a flowerpot near its parent. The frond, as yet only slightly  lobed, was only .16 of an inch in length and .2 in breadth, and was  supported on a rachis as fine as a hair and .23 of an inch in height. A  very thin glass filament, which projected for a length of .36 of an inch,  was fixed to the end of the frond. The movement was so highly magnified  that the figure (Fig. 53) cannot be fully trusted; but the frond was  constantly moving in a complex manner, and the bead greatly changed its  course eighteen times in the 12 hours of observation. Within half an hour  it often returned in a line almost parallel to its former course. The  greatest amount of movement occurred between 4 and 6 P.M. The  circumnutation of this plant is interesting, because the species in the  genus Lygodium are well known to circumnutate conspicuously and to twine  round any neighbouring object.    Fig. 53. Nephrodium molle: circumnutation of very young frond, traced in  darkness on horizontal glass, from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Oct. 30th. Movement of  bead magnified 48 times.    Selaginella Kraussii (?) (Lycopodiaceae).--A very young plant, only .4 of  an inch in height, had sprung up in a pot in the hot-house. An extremely  fine glass filament was fixed to the end of the frond-like stem, and the  movement of the bead traced on a horizontal glass. It changed its course  several times, as shown in Fig. 54, whilst observed during 13 h. 15 m., and  returned at night to a point not far distant from that whence it had  started in the morning. There can be no doubt that this little plant  circumnutated.    Fig. 54. Selaginella Kraussii (?): circumnutation of young plant, kept in  darkness, traced from 8.45 A.M. to 10 P.M. Oct. 31st.
