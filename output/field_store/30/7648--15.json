I want your nurse and the rest of the people to see you as you are, for  you will have to tell them how you ran away for fear of the long-legged  cat.  I should like to wash you, but they would not believe you then.  Do you see that bath behind you?'    The princess looked, and saw a large oval tub of silver, shining  brilliantly in the light of the wonderful lamp.    'Go and look into it,' said the lady.    Irene went, and came back very silent with her eyes shining.    'What did you see?' asked her grandmother.    'The sky, and the moon and the stars,' she answered.  'It looked as if  there was no bottom to it.'    The lady smiled a pleased satisfied smile, and was silent also for a  few moments.  Then she said:    'Any time you want a bath, come to me.  I know YOU have a bath every  morning, but sometimes you want one at night, too.'    'Thank you, grandmother; I will--I will indeed,' answered Irene, and  was again silent for some moments thinking.  Then she said: 'How was  it, grandmother, that I saw your beautiful lamp--not the light of it  only--but the great round silvery lamp itself, hanging alone in the  great open air, high up?  It was your lamp I saw--wasn't it?'    'Yes, my child--it was my lamp.'    'Then how was it?  I don't see a window all round.'    'When I please I can make the lamp shine through the walls--shine so  strong that it melts them away from before the sight, and shows itself  as you saw it.  But, as I told you, it is not everybody can see it.'    'How is it that I can, then?  I'm sure I don't know.'    'It is a gift born with you.  And one day I hope everybody will have  it.'    'But how do you make it shine through the walls?'    'Ah! that you would not understand if I were to try ever so much to  make you--not yet--not yet.  But,' added the lady, rising, 'you must  sit in my chair while I get you the present I have been preparing for  you.  I told you my spinning was for you.  It is finished now, and I am  going to fetch it.  I have been keeping it warm under one of my  brooding pigeons.'    Irene sat down in the low chair, and her grandmother left her, shutting  the door behind her.  The child sat gazing, now at the rose fire, now  at the starry walls, now at the silver light; and a great quietness  grew in her heart.  If all the long-legged cats in the world had come  rushing at her then she would not have been afraid of them for a  moment.  How this was she could not tell--she only knew there was no  fear in her, and everything was so right and safe that it could not get  in.    She had been gazing at the lovely lamp for some minutes fixedly:  turning her eyes, she found the wall had vanished, for she was looking  out on the dark cloudy night.  But though she heard the wind blowing,  none of it blew upon her.  In a moment more the clouds themselves  parted, or rather vanished like the wall, and she looked straight into  the starry herds, flashing gloriously in the dark blue.  It was but for  a moment.  The clouds gathered again and shut out the stars; the wall  gathered again and shut out the clouds; and there stood the lady beside  her with the loveliest smile on her face, and a shimmering ball in her  hand, about the size of a pigeon's egg.    'There, Irene; there is my work for you!' she said, holding out the  ball to the princess.    She took it in her hand, and looked at it all over.  It sparkled a  little, and shone here and there, but not much.  It was of a sort of  grey-whiteness, something like spun glass.    'Is this all your spinning, grandmother?' she asked.    'All since you came to the house.  There is more there than you think.'    'How pretty it is!  What am I to do with it, please?'    'That I will now explain to you,' answered the lady, turning from her  and going to her cabinet.  She came back with a small ring in her hand.  Then she took the ball from Irene's, and did something with the  ring--Irene could not tell what.    'Give me your hand,' she said.  Irene held up her right hand.    'Yes, that is the hand I want,' said the lady, and put the ring on the  forefinger of it.    'What a beautiful ring!' said Irene.  'What is the stone called?'    'It is a fire-opal.' 'Please, am I to keep it?'    'Always.' 'Oh, thank you, grandmother!  It's prettier than anything I  ever saw, except those--of all colours-in your--Please, is that your  crown?'    'Yes, it is my crown.  The stone in your ring is of the same sort--only  not so good.  It has only red, but mine have all colours, you see.'    'Yes, grandmother.  I will take such care of it!  But--' she added,  hesitating.    'But what?' asked her grandmother.    'What am I to say when Lootie asks me where I got it?'    'You will ask her where you got it,' answered the lady smiling.    'I don't see how I can do that.'    'You will, though.'    'Of course I will, if you say so.  But, you know, I can't pretend not  to know.'    'Of course not.  But don't trouble yourself about it.  You will see  when the time comes.'    So saying, the lady turned, and threw the little ball into the rose  fire.    'Oh, grandmother!' exclaimed Irene; 'I thought you had spun it for me.'    'So I did, my child.  And you've got it.'    'No; it's burnt in the fire!'    The lady put her hand in the fire, brought out the ball, glimmering as  before, and held it towards her.  Irene stretched out her hand to take  it, but the lady turned and, going to her cabinet, opened a drawer, and  laid the ball in it.    'Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?' said Irene pitifully.    'No, my darling.  But you must understand that no one ever gives  anything to another properly and really without keeping it.  That ball  is yours.'    'Oh! I'm not to take it with me!  You are going to keep it for me!'    'You are to take it with you.  I've fastened the end of it to the ring  on your finger.'    Irene looked at the ring.    'I can't see it there, grandmother,' she said.    'Feel--a little way from the ring--towards the cabinet,' said the lady.    'Oh! I do feel it!' exclaimed the princess.  'But I can't see it,' she  added, looking close to her outstretched hand.    'No.  The thread is too fine for you to see it.  You can only feel it.  Now you can fancy how much spinning that took, although it does seem  such a little ball.'    'But what use can I make of it, if it lies in your cabinet?'    'That is what I will explain to you.  It would be of no use to you--it  wouldn't be yours at all if it did not lie in my cabinet.  Now listen.  If ever you find yourself in any danger--such, for example, as you were  in this same evening--you must take off your ring and put it under the  pillow of your bed.  Then you must lay your finger, the same that wore  the ring, upon the thread, and follow the thread wherever it leads you.'    'Oh, how delightful!  It will lead me to you, grandmother, I know!'    'Yes.  But, remember, it may seem to you a very roundabout way indeed,  and you must not doubt the thread.  Of one thing you may be sure, that  while you hold it, I hold it too.'    'It is very wonderful!' said Irene thoughtfully.  Then suddenly  becoming aware, she jumped up, crying:    'Oh, grandmother! here have I been sitting all this time in your chair,  and you standing!  I beg your pardon.'    The lady laid her hand on her shoulder, and said:    'Sit down again, Irene.  Nothing pleases me better than to see anyone  sit in my chair.  I am only too glad to stand so long as anyone will  sit in it.'    'How kind of you!' said the princess, and sat down again.    'It makes me happy,' said the lady.    'But,' said Irene, still puzzled, 'won't the thread get in somebody's  way and be broken, if the one end is fast to my ring, and the other  laid in your cabinet?'    'You will find all that arrange itself.  I am afraid it is time for you  to go.'    'Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?' 'No, not  tonight.  If I had meant you to stay tonight, I should have given you a  bath; but you know everybody in the house is miserable about you, and  it would be cruel to keep them so all night.  You must go downstairs.'    'I'm so glad, grandmother, you didn't say \"Go home,\" for this is my  home.  Mayn't I call this my home?'    'You may, my child.  And I trust you will always think it your home.  Now come.  I must take you back without anyone seeing you.'    'Please, I want to ask you one question more,' said Irene.  'Is it  because you have your crown on that you look so young?'    'No, child,' answered her grandmother; 'it is because I felt so young  this evening that I put my crown on.  And I thought you would like to  see your old grandmother in her best.'    'Why do you call yourself old?  You're not old, grandmother.'    'I am very old indeed.  It is so silly of people--I don't mean you, for  you are such a tiny, and couldn't know better--but it is so silly of  people to fancy that old age means crookedness and witheredness and  feebleness and sticks and spectacles and rheumatism and forgetfulness!  It is so silly! Old age has nothing whatever to do with all that.  The  right old age means strength and beauty and mirth and courage and clear  eyes and strong painless limbs.  I am older than you are able to think,  and--'    'And look at you, grandmother!' cried Irene, jumping up and flinging  her arms about her neck.  'I won't be so silly again, I promise you.  At least--I'm rather afraid to promise--but if I am, I promise to be  sorry for it--I do.  I wish I were as old as you, grandmother.  I don't  think you are ever afraid of anything.'    'Not for long, at least, my child.  Perhaps by the time I am two  thousand years of age, I shall, indeed, never be afraid of anything.  But I confess I have sometimes been afraid about my children--sometimes  about you, Irene.'    'Oh, I'm so sorry, grandmother!  Tonight, I suppose, you mean.'    'Yes--a little tonight; but a good deal when you had all but made up  your mind that I was a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#14)"],[1,"civilization.    This Indian, rejoicing in the name of Youal Carrière, was tall and  slight, lithe as a tiger, and quick as lightning; never at a loss,  naturally intelligent, and an adept in almost everything he attempted.  Having had a fair commercial education when in Brantford among his own  people, he was as good a clerk in an office as guide in the bush or cook  in camp. He was a keen politician, and ready to discuss almost any  question, yet always respectful and attentive. Although never officious,  he managed to make himself indispensable. He was fonder of life in the  bush than in town, yet as ready to amuse himself when there as any of his  friends; rather inclined to brag of his doings and sayings, and able to  tell the best story in camp, whoever might be his comrades.    We soon found ourselves on the shore of a small lake, which obtained its  name oddly enough. The first party of surveyors who crossed it upset two  bags of rice in its waters, and thenceforward it was known as Rice Lake.  On reaching the opposite shore, we found a man waiting to cross. He had  come down the night before, but all the boats were on the other side.    The second portage was much shorter and more level than the first, and  consisted of a pretty woodland track of less than half a mile to Lake  Deception, so called from the many times and many ways in which the first  surveying party were misled when running the line along its shores. One  night, after a hard day's work, they had settled down round their camp  fires, and, while dozing over their pipes, were roused by a shrill halloo  from down the trail. Not having had a mail for weeks, and expecting one  hourly, they all turned out to meet the carrier, shouting loudly to guide  him to the camp; but they were answered only by the shrill scream of the  screech-owl, whose hooting had led them on their bootless chase. Lake  Deception is very beautiful, with deep shady bays, high rocky shores, and  fair green islands. At the head of one of the bays Mr. C---- had built  his house.    As we neared the wharf, where stood a small shanty called by the men \"The  Fort,\" with a piece of red cotton doing duty as a flag flying from its  roof, a canoe came out to meet us, and a warm welcome from the doctor, an  old friend, followed. The Fort contained three rooms, each having a  narrow window, and the largest provided with a mud chimney and open  fireplace. The furniture comprised a couple of bunk-beds, a few shelves,  one table, several stools and benches, washstands built into the corners,  and a comfortable sofa, seeming very much out of place in what, to our  eyes, looked anything but a comfortable abode. Yet we were told it was  one of the most luxurious shanties on the line.    Our luggage could not be brought over until late in the afternoon, so  there was nothing to be done but to exercise our patience and wait,  enduring the discomfort of feeling as well as looking as if we had  travelled for a week, with all the dust of the Dawson road, as well as  all the mud of the muskegs, upon our persons.          CHAPTER X.    Making a New Home--Carrière's Kitchen--The Navvies' _Salle-à-Manger_--A  Curious Milking Custom--Insect Plagues--Peterboro' Canoes--Fishing  Trips--Mail-day--Indian dread of drowning--The Indian Mail-carrier and  his Partner--Talking by Telegraph--Prairie Fires.      A detailed account of how we spent the next few weeks would be of little  interest, so I will only give it in outline. We slept in the house and  took our meals at the fort, Carrière doing the cooking under a low tent  close by, which, as a kitchen, was decidedly a curiosity. It occupied a  small space not ten feet square, in only five feet of which we could  stand upright, and contained cases of tinned fruits, vegetables, sauces,  and meats, barrels of flour and meal, caddies of tea and coffee, a small  sheet-iron cooking-stove, all the pots, pans, pasteboards, and all other  culinary necessaries. There was also a rickety table, at which the men,  often five and six at a time, had their meals, sitting on the nearest  case, bag, or barrel. It was so crowded that one wondered how Carrière  managed to get up such excellent dinners with such limited accommodation.  He also made delicious bread, baking it in a hole in the side of the  hill, heated by building a fire round it.    By degrees we moved into the house, as the carpenters moved out, taking  their bed of shavings with them; and we found daily amusement in the  novelty of our surroundings. The house stood on a slight elevation in the  valley above the lake, about a hundred and fifty feet off. To the west  was a perpendicular wall of rock, rising to a height of forty or fifty  feet, covered with tall pines, moss, and ferns. To the east lay a plot of  grass, divided by a deep narrow creek from half a dozen dirty tents  occupied by the navvies.    The largest of these had a fire burning before it, over which hung a  perpetual kettle of pea-soup. Hard by stood a long table of rough boards,  laid on rudely fashioned trestles; another board, narrower, and several  inches lower, serving as a seat. This table was set almost as often as  the pea-soup was stirred. Its appointments were simple, but satisfactory  to the guests. There were tin plates and cups, heavy knives and forks, a  pepper pot, a mug of mustard, another of salt, a bottle of pickles, and  one of sauce. When dinner was ready, the cook, a little fat man, with an  apron tied round his waist, a long red _toque_ on his head, and his  shirt-sleeves rolled above his elbows, put his hands to his mouth, and  gave a loud halloo. Then from every part of the works poured the men  belonging to his mess, going first to the creek to wash their hands. As  soon as they were seated, the little fellow filled their plates first  with soup and next with pork and beans, out of another steaming pot. Ten  minutes of rapid feeding satisfied their appetites, and they adjourned to  the fallen trees and scattered logs to enjoy their pipes at leisure.    Vigorously wiping down the table, the cook set it anew for the  \"officers\"--that is, the contractors, engineers, and their assistants;  the doctor, paymaster, and any one of similar status, who happened to be  _en route_ to another part of the line. Their dinner call was a  shrill whistle, and their bill of fare differed from the navvies' only in  the addition of pies made of dried apples, and an unlimited allowance of  pickles and sugar. Their dinner hour, too, was a \"movable feast,\" as in  rainy weather they took it between the showers; the navvies did not mind  a wetting.    Behind Mr. C----'s house the ground rose more rapidly to the line of  railway, and at the north end of the west rock was a fish-pond, which  never had any fish in it, although a good deal of attention was paid to  stocking it. About four hundred feet to the east is another rock almost  as high as the one on the west, beyond which the lake narrows, and the  future railway crossing is projected. Of course it took much longer to  arrange and make up the necessary useful and ornamental \"fixings,\" as the  Yankees call them, for our new house when we were thrown entirely upon  our own resources than it would have done in town, where stores and  assistants are always to be had; and the saying that \"necessity is the  mother of invention,\" was repeatedly verified in our case. Time,  therefore, never hung heavily upon our hands, and everything about us  having the charm of novelty, gave zest to what to many people would have  been but a dull life.    The climate is delightful. A cool fresh breeze always blowing from the  lake, tempers the heat, and to a great extent keeps off those foes to  comfort in the bush--mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, and deer flies,  or bull-dogs, as they call them there.    Manitoban mosquitoes are larger than those of any other part of Canada,  and nothing but smoke will drive them away. Many people who live on the  prairies, instead of going for their cattle at milking time, build a  smudge (a fire of chips mulched with wet hay or green twigs when well  started, to create smoke) near the milk house, and the cattle will come  to the fire to obtain relief from the mosquitoes. The black flies are  smaller, and the first intimation one has of their attack is a small  stream of blood trickling down one's neck from behind the ear. They bite  and die, but there are myriads to take their place. The black flies are  most troublesome during the day, the mosquitoes at night. Sand flies, as  their name implies, resemble a grain of sand, and their bites are like a  thousand red-hot needles piercing the skin at once, they are attracted by  a light, and no netting will keep them out. Last, but by no means least,  are the deer-flies, great big brutes, larger than the largest blue bottle  fly. They generally devote their attentions to cattle, and I have seen  the poor cows rushing madly down the clearing, the bells round their  necks jangling wildly, lashing their tails and tossing their heads, never  stopping until safe from their tormentors in the shelter of the dark  stable. The dogs, too, are often so covered with these wretched pests,  that nothing but dragging themselves through the thick underbrush will  set them free. Their bite is very venomous. One of the engineers showed  me the back of his hand where one had bitten him a few hours before; it  was blue and angry-looking, swollen to twice its usual size, and very  painful. Fortunately the deer-fly does not bite often.    We were able to explore the lake, as Mr. C---- had two Rice Lake or  Peterboro' canoes. These boats are built by a firm in Peterboro',  Ontario, and are steadier than birch-bark canoes, though not so light.  They are much used in all parts of Canada, although the Indians prefer  the birch-bark. We went out almost every evening, named all the bays,  points, and islands, caught lots of excellent pike with a "]]]
