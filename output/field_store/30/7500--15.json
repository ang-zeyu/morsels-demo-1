Upon the 18th, there assembled in the Duomo a still more numerous  and distinguished auditory; when, after celebration of mass by the  nuncio, he seated himself before the altar, with the Prefect on his  right, and the Duke on his left, and in an elegant Latin discourse,  set forth the desire of the latter to make sure the succession by  adopting his nephew, and the approval of the Pope and college of  cardinals to that substitution, in evidence of which the brieves and  other formal documents were read. A magnificent missal,--perhaps  that painted for Matthew Corvinus King of Hungary, which adorns the  Vatican Urbino Library,--was then placed in the hands of Francesco  Maria, opened at a miniature of the holy sacrament, and upon it  deputies from the communities of the duchy took the oath of fidelity  and homage to him as their future sovereign; all which having been  regularly attested in notorial instruments, the solemnity ended.[*20]    [Footnote *20: Cf. MADIAI, _op. cit._, in _Arch. cit._, vol.  _cit._, p. 451-2.]    These events served to aggravate the jealousy of the Venetians  against the claims of Julius upon their recent acquisitions of  Romagna, which they regarded as fairly conquered from Borgia. They  possessed in this way the states of Ravenna, Faenza, and Rimini, and  had gained footing upon the territories of Imola, Forli, and Cesena,  the inhabitants of which loudly complained of their aggressions.  Of all these places the Church was the acknowledged superior, and  the old investitures held under her by their respective princely  families had been annulled by Alexander, in order to make way for  his son. Some of these dynasties had died out, and Julius showed  no disposition to restore the others, his leading object being the  temporal aggrandisement of the papacy. At this juncture his Holiness  sent for Guidobaldo, to consult with him; and in order to facilitate  his arrival, presented him with a commodious litter swung between  two beautifully dappled horses. The winter journey was, however,  disastrous to his dilapidated frame, and he was laid up for nine  days at Narni with gout, complicated by fever and dysentery, and  consequently did not reach Rome with his nephew and Castiglione  until the 2nd of January, when they slept outside of the gate, and  next morning made a solemn entrance. It was the great object of the  Republic to be received as vicar or vassal of the Holy See in the  three first-mentioned states, and for this end they were willing to  abandon all claims and attempts upon the remaining three. Guidobaldo,  interposing as a mediator to prevent an open breach between parties  so mutually deserving of his friendship, persuaded the Signory to  abandon the latter places, and trust to the justice of Julius for the  fulfilment of their desires. To procure this, they sent, in April,  a splendid embassy to Rome of eight commissioners, with two hundred  attendants, headed by Bembo, who, passing by Urbino, received from  the Duchess a princely welcome. But no benefit accrued from this  measure, for the Pontiff's ultimatum was announced to the senate  through Louis XII., giving them Rimini and Faenza, during his life  only, a result highly unsatisfactory to the Republic.    The Duke's prolonged residence in Rome, where his company became  greatly prized by the Pope, was little relished by his consort or his  people; so, to maintain them in good humour, his Holiness announced  a plenary indulgence for all their broken vows and deeds of violence  during the late usurpation, to such as should devoutly observe the  Easter ceremonies. The alms collected at this jubilee, amounting to  2265 florins, were expended upon the duomo of Urbino. At length, in  the end of July, 1506, he obtained leave to return home, on the plea  that change of air was advisable for his health.[*21]    [Footnote *21: Cf. MADIAI, _op. cit._, in _Arch. cit._, vol.  _cit._, p. 455. This Diary says that the Duke returned at the end of  February, 1506.]    Julius, having announced to the consistory his intention of extending  the temporal sovereignty of the Church over such portions of the  ecclesiastical territory as were possessed by tyrants (for so he  called the vicars and other lords who ruled their petty states as  feudatories of the Holy See), carried his design into effect with  characteristic energy. He set out for Perugia on the 26th of August,  after having directed the Duke of Urbino and his nephew to march  thither, each with two hundred men-at-arms, and expel its seigneur  Gianpaolo Baglioni. Here Guidobaldo again appeared as mediator, and,  persuaded by him to submit with good grace to a fate that he could  not avert, the Lord of Perugia gave up his fortresses, and was taken  into the pay of Julius for his expedition against Bologna. The Pope,  elated by the ease with which so formidable an opponent had been  disposed of, pressed on preparations for attacking the Bentivoglii.  He reached Urbino on the 25th of September, accompanied by twenty-two  cardinals, with a suitable cortege, and a guard of four hundred men.  Beyond the walls he was received by forty-five noble youths, dressed  in doublets and hose of white silk, who, on his alighting, seized as  their perquisite his richly caparisoned mule, which was afterwards  redeemed from them for sixty golden ducats. The gates were thrown  down to receive him, and he was there met by the Duke, disabled from  dismounting; by the magistracy, who presented the keys; and by the  court and clergy. A rich canopy shaded him, as the holy sacrament  was borne before him to the cathedral; and after devotion there, he  entered the palace, which next evening was illuminated, along with  the citadel, fireworks being displayed in the piazza. Some singular  usages of hospitality were adopted on this occasion. The Duke  presented to his Holiness a hundred sacks of flour, as much barley  and corn, with a proportionate quantity of live stock and poultry,  to the value in all of 800 ducats.[*22] This donative was accepted,  and part of it was handed over to the hospital of the Misericordia.  In anticipation of the Pope's advent, the roads were repaired and  smoothed, triumphal arches and statues were erected, flowers and  evergreens were strewn before him, the streets were adorned with gay  hangings and shaded by linen awnings, the palace was arrayed in those  rich tapestries, pictures, and furniture, which the taste of Federigo  and his son had accumulated. Next evening, the palace roofs and the  citadel were illuminated, and over the latter was hung a brilliant  cross of fire. Deputations arrived from Pesaro, and the principal  places in the duchy, with gifts of provisions; but large supplies had  been previously laid in by the Duke for so vast an influx; and in  order to regulate prices, the following tariff, calculated at about  half the current value, was proclaimed.      Wheat, per staio or bush    45  bolognini.    Barley      \"      \"        36      \"    Oats        \"      \"        24      \"    Wine, per somma             54      \"    Ditto, new  \"               27      \"    Mutton, per lb.              1      \"    Veal, per lb.               10      \"    Ox flesh   \"                 8      \"    Salt meat  \"            1 to 7      \"    Capons, per pair             9      \"    Fowls      \"            4 to 7      \"    Pigeons    \"            4 to 7      \"    Wood pigeons, per pair  1 to 7      \"    Eggs, seven for              1      \"    Cheese, per lb.         1 to 7      \"    Hay, per cwt.           4 to 7      \"    Wood, per somma            1/2  carlino.[23]    [Footnote *22: Cf.

No.  904. During the preceding year of scarcity, wheat had varied in  different parts of Italy from four to twelve golden ducats, each  of forty bolognini, a price scarcely credible. Riposati quotes a  document proving that in 1450 a florin contained forty bolognini of  Gubbio, of which twenty-nine and a half were coined from an ounce of  silver, with 9/48 of alloy. Although it seems right to insert the  above tariff, most of the prices appear enormous, beyond all belief.  See the Preface to this work, for the comparative value of money.  *This diary is the one quoted under MADIAI.]    [Illustration: _Anderson_    POPE JULIUS II    _From the picture by Raphael in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]    On the 29th of the month, his Holiness set out for Bologna, and,  avoiding the territory held by the Venetians, reached Cesena on  the 2nd of October by mountain tracks through Macerata and S. Leo.  Thence he summoned the Bentivoglii to surrender their city to him as  its lawful sovereign, and ordered the people on pain of interdict  to abandon their cause, and open the gates. These chiefs had made  great preparations for defence, but subsequently, on finding  themselves deserted by Louis XII., offered terms, to which Julius,  elated at the prospect of French succours, would not listen. The  war, which promised to be obstinate, passed off in a revolution; for  the Bentivoglii, losing heart, made their escape, to the delight  of the citizens, who, thus saved from a siege, threw open their  gates, and hailed the Pope as their liberator. He made his entry  on Martinmas-day, and at once confirmed this favourable impression  by abolishing various grievances, and by scattering in the streets  4000 golden scudi bearing the legend \"Bologna freed from its tyrant  by Julius.\"[24] The mob showed their zeal by demolishing the  palace of their late rulers, one of the most beautiful in Italy,  wherein miserably perished many treasures of art; and its ill-fated  master and mistress soon after died of broken hearts in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#14)"],[1," there was nothing new in the world.  I think it was while we were in  London and while we were deep in the many fads of bibliomania that we  arrived at this important conclusion.    We had been pursuing with enthusiasm the exciting delights of  extra-illustration, a practice sometimes known as Grangerism; the  friends of the practice call it by the former name, the enemies by the  latter.  We were engaged at extra-illustrating Boswell's life of  Johnson, and had already got together somewhat more than eleven  thousand prints when we ran against a snag, an obstacle we never could  surmount.  We agreed that our work would be incomplete, and therefore  vain, unless we secured a picture of the book with which the great  lexicographer knocked down Osborne, the bookseller at Gray's Inn Gate.    Unhappily we were wholly in the dark as to what the title of that book  was, and, although we ransacked the British Museum and even appealed to  the learned Frognall Dibdin, we could not get a clew to the identity of  the volume.  To be wholly frank with you, I will say that both the  Judge and I had wearied of the occupation; moreover, it involved great  expense, since we were content with nothing but India proofs (those  before letters preferred).  So we were glad of this excuse for  abandoning the practice.    While we were contemplating a graceful retreat the Judge happened to  discover in the \"Natural History\" of Pliny a passage which proved to  our satisfaction that, so far from being a new or a modern thing, the  extra-illustration of books was of exceptional antiquity.  It seems  that Atticus, the friend of Cicero, wrote a book on the subject of  portraits and portrait-painting, in the course of which treatise he  mentions that Marcus Varro \"conceived the very liberal idea of  inserting, by some means or another, in his numerous volumes, the  portraits of several hundred individuals, as he could not bear the idea  that all traces of their features should be lost or that the lapse of  centuries should get the better of mankind.\"    \"Thus,\" says Pliny, \"was he the inventor of a benefit to his fellow-men  that might have been envied by the gods themselves; for not only did he  confer immortality upon the originals of these portraits, but he  transmitted these portraits to all parts of the earth, so that  everywhere it might be possible for them to be present, and for each to  occupy his niche.\"    Now, Pliny is not the only one who has contributed to the  immortalization of Marcus Varro.  I have had among my papers for thirty  years the verses which Judge Methuen dashed off (for poets invariably  dash off their poetry), and they are such pleasant verses that I don't  mind letting the world see them.                  MARCUS VARRO       Marcus Varro went up and down        The places where old books were sold;     He ransacked all the shops in town        For pictures new and pictures old.     He gave the folk of earth no peace;        Snooping around by day and night,     He plied the trade in Rome and Greece        Of an insatiate Grangerite.      \"Pictures!\" was evermore his cry--        \"Pictures of old or recent date,\"     And pictures only would he buy        Wherewith to \"extra-illustrate.\"     Full many a tome of ancient type        And many a manuscript he took,     For nary purpose but to swipe        Their pictures for some other book.       While Marcus Varro plied his fad        There was not in the shops of Greece     A book or pamphlet to be had        That was not minus frontispiece.     Nor did he hesitate to ply        His baleful practices at home;     It was not possible to buy        A perfect book in all of Rome!       What must the other folk have done--        Who, glancing o'er the books they bought,     Came soon and suddenly upon        The vandalism Varro wrought!     How must their cheeks have flamed with red--        How did their hearts with choler beat!     We can imagine what they said--        We can imagine, not repeat!       Where are the books that Varro made--        The pride of dilettante Rome--     With divers portraitures inlaid        Swiped from so many another tome?     The worms devoured them long ago--        O wretched worms! ye should have fed     Not on the books \"extended\" so,        But on old Varro's flesh instead!       Alas, that Marcus Varro lives        And is a potent factor yet!     Alas, that still his practice gives        Good men occasion for regret!     To yonder bookstall, pri'thee, go,        And by the \"missing\" prints and plates     And frontispieces you shall know        He lives, and \"extra-illustrates\"!      In justice to the Judge and to myself I should say that neither of us  wholly approves the sentiment which the poem I have quoted implies.  We  regard Grangerism as one of the unfortunate stages in bibliomania; it  is a period which seldom covers more than five years, although Dr.  O'Rell has met with one case in his practice that has lasted ten years  and still gives no symptom of abating in virulence.    Humanity invariably condones the pranks of youth on the broad and  charitable grounds that \"boys will be boys\"; so we bibliomaniacs are  prone to wink at the follies of the Grangerite, for we know that he  will know better by and by and will heartily repent of the mischief he  has done.  We know the power of books so well that we know that no man  can have to do with books that presently he does not love them.  He may  at first endure them; then he may come only to pity them; anon, as  surely as the morrow's sun riseth, he shall embrace and love those  precious things.    So we say that we would put no curb upon any man, it being better that  many books should be destroyed, if ultimately by that destruction a  penitent and loyal soul be added to the roster of bibliomaniacs.  There is more joy over one Grangerite that repenteth than over ninety  and nine just men that need no repentance.    And we have a similar feeling toward such of our number as for the  nonce become imbued with a passion for any of the other little fads  which bibliomaniac flesh is heir to.  All the soldiers in an army  cannot be foot, or horse, or captains, or majors, or generals, or  artillery, or ensigns, or drummers, or buglers.  Each one has his place  to fill and his part to do, and the consequence is a concinnate whole.  Bibliomania is beautiful as an entirety, as a symmetrical blending of a  multitude of component parts, and he is indeed disloyal to the cause  who, through envy or shortsightedness or ignorance, argues to the  discredit of angling, or Napoleonana, or balladry, or Indians, or  Burns, or Americana, or any other branch or phase of bibliomania; for  each of these things accomplishes a noble purpose in that each  contributes to the glory of the great common cause of bibliomania,  which is indeed the summum bonum of human life.    I have heard many decried who indulged  their fancy for bookplates, as  if, forsooth, if a man loved his books, he should not lavish upon them  testimonials of his affection!  Who that loves his wife should hesitate  to buy adornments for her person? I favor everything that tends to  prove that the human heart is swayed by the tenderer emotions.  Gratitude is surely one of the noblest emotions of which humanity is  capable, and he is indeed unworthy of our respect who would forbid  humanity's expressing in every dignified and reverential manner its  gratitude for the benefits conferred by the companionship of books.    As for myself, I urge upon all lovers of books to provide themselves  with bookplates.  Whenever I see a book that bears its owner's plate I  feel myself obligated to treat that book with special consideration.  It carries with it a certificate of its master's love; the bookplate  gives the volume a certain status it would not otherwise have.  Time  and again I have fished musty books out of bins in front of bookstalls,  bought them and borne them home with me simply because they had upon  their covers the bookplates of their former owners.  I have a case  filled with these aristocratic estrays, and I insist that they shall be  as carefully dusted and kept as my other books, and I have provided in  my will for their perpetual maintenance after my decease.    If I were a rich man I should found a hospital for homeless  aristocratic books, an institution similar in all essential particulars  to the institution which is now operated at our national capital under  the bequest of the late Mr. Cochrane.  I should name it the Home for  Genteel Volumes in Decayed Circumstances.    I was a young man when I adopted the bookplate which I am still using,  and which will be found in all my books.  I drew the design myself and  had it executed by a son of Anderson, the first of American engravers.  It is by no means elaborate: a book rests upon a heart, and underneath  appear the lines:         My Book and Heart       Must never part.    Ah, little Puritan maid, with thy dear eyes of honest blue and thy fair  hair in proper  plaits adown thy back, little thought we that  springtime long ago back among the New England hills that the tiny book  we read together should follow me through all my life!  What a part has  that Primer played!  And now all these other beloved companions bear  witness to the love I bear that Primer and its teachings, for each  wears the emblem I plucked from its homely pages.    That was in the springtime, Captivity Waite; anon came summer, with all  its exuberant glory, and presently the cheery autumn stole upon me.  And now it is the winter-time, and under the snows lies buried  many a  sweet, fair thing I cherished once.  I am aweary and will rest a little  while; lie thou there, my pen, for a dream--a pleasant dream--calleth  me away.  I shall see those distant hills again, and the homestead  under the elms; the old associations and the old influences shall be  round about me, and a child shall lead me"]]]
