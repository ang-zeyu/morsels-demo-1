But John Brake who married that  Mary Bewery--who was he? Who indeed, laughed Bryce, but John Braden,  who had just come by his death in Wrychester Paradise? And there was the  name of Mark Ransford as witness. What was the further probability? That  Mark Ransford had been John Brake's best man; that he was the Marco  of the recent Times advertisement; that John Braden, or Brake, was the  Sticker of the same advertisement. Clear!--clear as noonday! And--what  did it all mean, and imply, and what bearing had it on Braden or Brake's  death?    Before he ate his cold beef, Bryce had copied the entry from the  reprinted register, and had satisfied himself that Ransford was not a  name known to that village--Mark Ransford was the only person of the  name mentioned in the register. And his lunch done, he set off for the  vicarage again, intent on getting further information, and before he  reached the vicarage gates noticed, by accident, a place whereat he was  more likely to get it than from the vicar--who was a youngish man. At  the end of the few houses between the inn and the bridge he saw a little  shop with the name Charles Claybourne painted roughly above its open  window. In that open window sat an old, cheery-faced man, mending shoes,  who blinked at the stranger through his big spectacles.    Bryce saw his chance and turned in--to open the book and point out the  marriage entry.    \"Are you the Charles Claybourne mentioned there?\" he asked, without  ceremony.    \"That's me, sir!\" replied the old shoemaker briskly, after a glance.  \"Yes--right enough!\"    \"How came you to witness that marriage?\" inquired Bryce.    The old man nodded at the church across the way.    \"I've been sexton and parish clerk two-and-thirty years, sir,\" he said.  \"And I took it on from my father--and he had the job from his father.\"    \"Do you remember this marriage?\" asked Bryce, perching himself on the  bench at which the shoemaker was working. \"Twenty-two years since, I  see.\"    \"Aye, as if it was yesterday!\" answered the old man with a smile. \"Miss  Bewery's marriage?--why, of course!\"    \"Who was she?\" demanded Bryce.    \"Governess at the vicarage,\" replied Claybourne. \"Nice, sweet young  lady.\"    \"And the man she married?--Mr. Brake,\" continued Bryce. \"Who was he?\"    \"A young gentleman that used to come here for the fishing, now and  then,\" answered Claybourne, pointing at the river. \"Famous for our trout  we are here, you know, sir. And Brake had come here for three years  before they were married--him and his friend Mr. Ransford.\"    \"You remember him, too?\" asked Bryce.    \"Remember both of 'em very well indeed,\" said Claybourne, \"though I  never set eyes on either after Miss Mary was wed to Mr. Brake. But I  saw plenty of 'em both before that. They used to put up at the inn  there--that I saw you come out of just now. They came two or three times  a year--and they were a bit thick with our parson of that time--not this  one: his predecessor--and they used to go up to the vicarage and smoke  their pipes and cigars with him--and of course, Mr. Brake and the  governess fixed it up. Though, you know, at one time it was considered  it was going to be her and the other young gentleman, Mr. Ransford--yes!  But, in the end, it was Brake--and Ransford stood best man for him.\"    Bruce assimilated all this information greedily--and asked for more.    \"I'm interested in that entry,\" he said, tapping the open book. \"I know  some people of the name of Bewery--they may be relatives.\"    The shoemaker shook his head as if doubtful.    \"I remember hearing it said,\" he remarked, \"that Miss Mary had no  relations. She'd been with the old vicar some time, and I don't remember  any relations ever coming to see her, nor her going away to see any.\"    \"Do you know what Brake was?\" asked Bryce. \"As you say he came here for  a good many times before the marriage, I suppose you'd hear something  about his profession, or trade, or whatever it was?\"    \"He was a banker, that one,\" replied Claybourne. \"A banker--that was  his trade, sir. T'other gentleman, Mr. Ransford, he was a doctor--I mind  that well enough, because once when him and Mr. Brake were fishing here,  Thomas Joynt's wife fell downstairs and broke her leg, and they fetched  him to her--he'd got it set before they'd got the reg'lar doctor out  from Barthorpe yonder.\"    Bryce had now got all the information he wanted, and he made the old  parish clerk a small present and turned to go. But another question  presented itself to his mind and he reentered the little shop.    \"Your late vicar?\" he said. \"The one in whose family Miss Bewery was  governess--where is he now? Dead?\"    \"Can't say whether he's dead or alive, sir,\" replied Claybourne.  \"He left this parish for another--a living in a different part of  England--some years since, and I haven't heard much of him from that  time to this--he never came back here once, not even to pay us a  friendly visit--he was a queerish sort. But I'll tell you what, sir,\"  he added, evidently anxious to give his visitor good value for his  half-crown, \"our present vicar has one of those books with the names  of all the clergymen in 'em, and he'd tell you where his predecessor is  now, if he's alive--name of Reverend Thomas Gilwaters, M.A.--an Oxford  college man he was, and very high learned.\"    Bryce went back to the vicarage, returned the borrowed book, and asked  to look at the registers for the year 1891. He verified his copy and  turned to the vicar.    \"I accidentally came across the record of a marriage there in which I'm  interested,\" he said as he paid the search fees. \"Celebrated by your  predecessor, Mr. Gilwaters. I should be glad to know where Mr. Gilwaters  is to be found. Do you happen to possess a clerical directory?\"    The vicar produced a \"Crockford\", and Bryce turned over its pages. Mr.  Gilwaters, who from the account there given appeared to be an elderly  man who had now retired, lived in London, in Bayswater, and Bryce made a  note of his address and prepared to depart.    \"Find any names that interested you?\" asked the vicar as his caller  left. \"Anything noteworthy?\"    \"I found two or three names which interested me immensely,\" answered  Bryce from the foot of the vicarage steps. \"They were well worth  searching for.\"    And without further explanation he marched off to Barthorpe duly  followed by his shadow, who saw him safely into the Peacock an hour  later--and, an hour after that, went to the police superintendent with  his report.    \"Gone, sir,\" he said. \"Left by the five-thirty express for London.\"          CHAPTER IX. THE HOUSE OF HIS FRIEND      Bryce found himself at eleven o'clock next morning in a small book-lined  parlour in a little house which stood in a quiet street in the  neighbourhood of Westbourne Grove. Over the mantelpiece, amongst other  odds and ends of pictures and photographs, hung a water-colour drawing  of Braden Medworth--and to him presently entered an old, silver-haired  clergyman whom he at once took to be Braden Medworth's former vicar,  and who glanced inquisitively at his visitor and then at the card which  Bryce had sent in with a request for an interview.    \"Dr. Bryce?\" he said inquiringly. \"Dr. Pemberton Bryce?\"    Bryce made his best bow and assumed his suavest and most ingratiating  manner.    \"I hope I am not intruding on your time, Mr. Gilwaters?\" he said. \"The  fact is, I was referred to you, yesterday, by the present vicar of  Braden Medworth--both he, and the sexton there, Claybourne, whom you, of  course, remember, thought you would be able to give me some information  on a subject which is of great importance--to me.\"    \"I don't know the present vicar,\" remarked Mr. Gilwaters, motioning  Bryce to a chair, and taking another close by. \"Clayborne, of course,  I remember very well indeed--he must be getting an old man now--like  myself! What is it you want to know, now?\"    \"I shall have to take you into my confidence,\" replied Bryce, who had  carefully laid his plans and prepared his story, \"and you, I am sure,  Mr. Gilwaters, will respect mine. I have for two years been in practice  at Wrychester, and have there made the acquaintance of a young lady whom  I earnestly desire to marry. She is the ward of the man to whom I have  been assistant. And I think you will begin to see why I have come to you  when I say that this young lady's name is--Mary Bewery.\"    The old clergyman started, and looked at his visitor with unusual  interest. He grasped the arm of his elbow chair and leaned forward.    \"Mary Bewery!\" he said in a low whisper. \"What--what is the name of the  man who is her--guardian?\"    \"Dr. Mark Ransford,\" answered Bryce promptly.    The old man sat upright again, with a little toss of his head.    \"Bless my soul!\" he exclaimed. \"Mark Ransford! Then--it must have been  as I feared--and suspected!\"    Bryce made no remark. He knew at once that he had struck on something,  and it was his method to let people take their own time. Mr. Gilwaters  had already fallen into something closely resembling a reverie: Bryce  sat silently waiting and expectant. And at last the old man leaned  forward again, almost eagerly.    \"What is it you want to know?\" he asked, repeating his first question.  \"Is--is there some--some mystery?\"    \"Yes!\" replied Bryce. \"A mystery that I want to solve, sir. And I dare  say that you can help me, if you'll be so good. I am convinced--in fact,  I know!--that this young lady is in ignorance of her parentage, that  Ransford is keeping some fact, some truth back from her--and I want to  find things out. By the merest chance--accident, in fact--I discovered  yesterday at Braden Medworth that some twenty-two years ago you married  one Mary Bewery, who, I learnt there, was your governess, to a John  Brake, and that Mark Ransford was John Brake's best man and a witness  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#14)"],[1,"old red handkerchief, inconceivably soiled. The tramp  removed it, grumbling and whining. Mifflin gave me the pistol to  hold while he tied our prisoner's wrists together. In the meantime  we heard a shout from the quarry. The three vagabonds were gazing up  in great excitement.    \"You tell those fashion plates down there,\" said Mifflin, as he  knotted the tramp's hands together, \"that if they make any fight  I'll shoot them like crows.\" His voice was cold and savage and he  seemed quite master of the situation, but I must confess I wondered  how we could handle four of them.    The greasy ruffian shouted down to his pals in the quarry, but I did  not hear what he said, as just then the Professor asked me to keep  our captive covered while he got a stick. I stood with the pistol  pointed at his head while Mifflin ran back into the birchwood to cut  a cudgel.    The tramp's face became the colour of the under side of a fried egg  as he looked into the muzzle of his own gun.    \"Say, lady,\" he pleaded, \"that gun goes off awful easy, point her  somewhere else or you'll croak me by mistake.\"    I thought a good scare wouldn't do him any harm and kept the barrel  steadily on him.    The rascals down below seemed debating what to do. I don't know  whether they were armed or not; but probably they imagined that  there were more than two of us. At all events, by the time Mifflin  came back with a stout birch staff they were hustling out of the  quarry on the lower side. The Professor swore, and looked as if he  would gladly give chase, but he refrained.    \"Here, you,\" he said in crisp tones to the tramp, \"march on ahead of  us, down to the quarry.\"    The fat ruffian shambled awkwardly down the trail. We had to make  quite a detour to get into the quarry, and by the time we reached  there the other three tramps had got clean away. I was not sorry, to  tell the truth. I thought the Professor had had enough scrapping for  one twenty-four hours.    Peg whinneyed loudly as she saw us coming, but Bock was not in sight.    \"What have you done with the dog, you swine?\" said Mifflin. \"If  you've hurt him I'll make you pay with your own hide.\"    Our prisoner was completely cowed. \"No, boss, we ain't hurt the  dog,\" he fawned. \"We tied him up so he couldn't bark, that's all.  He's in the 'bus.\" And sure enough, by this time we could hear  smothered yelping and whining from Parnassus.    I hurried to open the door, and there was Bock, his jaws tied  together with a rope-end. He bounded out and made super-canine  efforts to express his joy at seeing the Professor again. He paid  very little attention to me.    \"Well,\" said Mifflin, after freeing the dog's muzzle, and with  difficulty restraining him from burying his teeth in the tramp's  shin, \"what shall we do with this heroic specimen of manhood? Shall  we cart him over to the jail in Port Vigor, or shall we let him go?\"    The tramp burst into a whining appeal that was almost funny, it was  so abject. The Professor cut it short.    \"I ought to pack you into quod,\" he said. \"Are you the Phoebus  Apollo I scuffled with down the lane last night? Was it you skulking  around this wagon then?\"    \"No, boss, that was Splitlip Sam, honest to Gawd it was. He come  back, boss; said he'd been fightin' with a cat-o'-mountain! Say,  boss, you sure hit him hard. One of his lamps is a pudding! Boss,  I'll swear I ain't had nothin' to do with it.\"    \"I don't like your society,\" said the Professor, \"and I'm going to  turn you loose. I'm going to count ten, and if you're not out of  this quarry by then, I'll shoot. And if I see you again I'll skin  you alive. Now get out!\"    He cut the knotted handkerchief in two. The hobo needed no urging.  He spun on his heel and fled like a rabbit. The Professor watched  him go, and as the fat, ungainly figure burst through a hedge and  disappeared he fired the revolver into the air to frighten him still  more. Then he tossed the weapon into the pool near by.    \"Well, Miss McGill,\" he said with a chuckle, \"if you like to  undertake breakfast, I'll fix up Peg.\" And he drew the horse-shoe  from his pocket once more.    A brief inspection of Parnassus satisfied me that the thieves had  not had time to do any real damage. They had got out most of the  eatables and spread them on a flat rock in preparation for a feast;  and they had tracked a good deal of mud into the van; but otherwise  I could see nothing amiss. So while Mifflin busied himself with  Peg's foot it was easy for me to get a meal under way. I found a  gush of clean water trickling down the face of the rock. There were  still some eggs and bread and cheese in the little cupboard, and an  unopened tin of condensed milk. I gave Peg her nose bag of oats, and  fed Bock, who was frisking about in high spirits. By that time the  shoeing was done, and the Professor and I sat down to an improvised  meal. I was beginning to feel as if this gipsy existence were the  normal course of my life.    \"Well, Professor,\" I said, as I handed him a cup of coffee and a  plate of scrambled eggs and cheese, \"for a man who slept in a wet  haystack, you acquit yourself with excellent valour.\"    \"Old Parnassus is quite a stormy petrel,\" he said. \"I used to think  the chief difficulty in writing a book would be to invent things to  happen, but if I were to sit down and write the adventures I'd had  with her it would be a regular Odyssey.\"    \"How about Peg's foot?\" I asked. \"Can she travel on it?\"    \"It'll be all right if you go easy. I've scraped out the injured  part and put the shoe back. I keep a little kit of tools under the  van for emergencies of all sorts.\"    It was chilly, and we didn't dawdle over our meal. I only made a  feint of eating, as I had had a little breakfast before, and also  as the events of the last few hours had left me rather restless. I  wanted to get Parnassus out on the highway again, to jog along in  the sun and think things over. The quarry was a desolate, forbidding  place anyway. But before we left we explored the cave where the  tramps had been preparing to make themselves comfortable for the  winter. It was not really a cave, but only a shaft into the granite  cliff. A screen of evergreen boughs protected the opening against  the weather, and inside were piles of sacking that had evidently  been used as beds, and many old grocery boxes for tables and chairs.  It amused me to notice a cracked fragment of mirror balanced on a  corner of rock. Even these ragamuffins apparently were not totally  unconscious of personal appearance. I seized the opportunity, while  the Professor was giving Peg's foot a final look, to rearrange my  hair, which was emphatically a sight. I hardly think Andrew would  have recognized me that morning.    We led Peg up the steep incline, back into the lane where I had  strayed, and at length we reached the main road again. Here I began  to lay down the law to Redbeard.    \"Now look here, Professor,\" I said, \"I'm not going to have you tramp  all the way back to Port Vigor. After the night you've had you need  a rest. You just climb into that Parnassus and lie down for a good  snooze. I'll drive you into Woodbridge and you can take your train  there. Now you get right into that bunk. I'll sit out here and drive.\"    He demurred, but without much emphasis. I think the little fool was  just about fagged out, and no wonder. I was a trifle groggy myself.  In the end he was quite docile. He climbed into the van, took off  his boots, and lay down under a blanket. Bock followed him, and I  think they both fell asleep on the instant. I got on the front seat  and took the reins. I didn't let Peg go more quickly than a walk as  I wanted to spare her sore foot.    My, what a morning that was after the rain! The road ran pretty  close to the shore, and every now and then I could catch a glimpse  of the water. The air was keen--not just the ordinary, unnoticed air  that we breathe in and out and don't think about, but a sharp and  tingling essence, as strong in the nostrils as camphor or ammonia.  The sun seemed focussed upon Parnassus, and we moved along the white  road in a flush of golden light. The flat fronds of the cedars  swayed gently in the salty air, and for the first time in ten  years, I should think, I began amusing myself by selecting words to  describe the goodness of the morning. I even imagined myself writing  a description of it, as if I were Andrew or Thoreau. The crazy  little Professor had inoculated me with his literary bug, I guess.    And then I did a dishonourable thing. Just by chance I put my hand  into the little pocket beside the seat where Mifflin kept a few odds  and ends. I meant to have another look at that card of his with the  poem on it. And there I found a funny, battered little notebook,  evidently forgotten. On the cover was written, in ink, \"Thoughts  on the Present Discontents.\" That title seemed vaguely familiar. I  seemed to recall something of the kind from my school days--more  than twenty years ago, goodness me! Of course if I had been  honourable I wouldn't have looked into it. But in a kind of  quibbling self-justification I recalled that I had bought Parnassus  and all it contained, \"lock, stock, barrel and bung\" as Andrew used  to say. And so....    The notebook was full of little jottings, written in pencil in  the Professor's small, precise hand. The words were rubbed  and soiled, but plainly legible. I read this:      I don't suppose Bock or Peg get lonely, but by the bones of Ben  Gunn, I do. Seems silly when Herrick and Hans Andersen and Tennyson  and Thoreau and a whole wagonload of other good fellows are riding  at my back. I can hear them all talking as we trundle along. But  books aren't a _substantial_ world after all, and every now and then  we get hungry for some closer, more human relationships. I've been  totally alone now for eight years--except for Runt, and he might be  dead and never say so. This wandering "]]]
