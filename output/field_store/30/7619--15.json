But, in his heart, he heard one instant voice.  _\"On with the torch once more, make all things new,  Build the new heaven and earth, and save the world.\"_    Ah, but the infinite patience, the long months  Lavished on tasks that, to the common eye,  Were insignificant, never to be crowned  With great results, or even with earth's rewards.  Could Rembrandt but have painted him, in those hours  Making his first analysis of light  Alone, there, in his darkened Cambridge room  At Trinity! Could he have painted, too,  The secret glow, the mystery, and the power,  The sense of all the thoughts and unseen spires  That soared to heaven around him!                                    He stood there,  Obscure, unknown, the shadow of a man  In darkness, like a grey dishevelled ghost,  --Bare-throated, down at heel, his last night's supper  Littering his desk, untouched; his glimmering face,  Under his tangled hair, intent and still,--  Preparing our new universe.                              He caught  The sunbeam striking through that bullet-hole  In his closed shutter--a round white spot of light  Upon a small dark screen.                            He interposed  A prism of glass. He saw the sunbeam break  And spread upon the screen its rainbow band  Of disentangled colours, all in scale  Like notes in music; first, the violet ray,  Then indigo, trembling softly into blue;  Then green and yellow, quivering side by side;  Then orange, mellowing richly into red.  Then, in the screen, he made a small, round hole  Like to the first; and through it passed once more  Each separate coloured ray. He let it strike  Another prism of glass, and saw each hue  Bent at a different angle from its path,  The red the least, the violet ray the most;  But all in scale and order, all precise  As notes in music. Last, he took a lens,  And, passing through it all those coloured rays,  Drew them together again, remerging all  On that dark screen, in one white spot of light.    So, watching, testing, proving, he resolved  The seeming random glories of our day  Into a constant harmony, and found  How in the whiteness of the sunlight sleep  Compounded, all the colours of the world.  He saw how raindrops in the clouds of heaven  Breaking the light, revealed that sevenfold arch  Of colours, ranged as on his own dark screen,  Though now they spanned the mountains and wild seas.  Then, where that old-world order had gone down  Beneath a darker deluge, he beheld  Gleams of the great new order and recalled  --Fraught with new meaning and a deeper hope--  That covenant which God made with all mankind  Throughout all generations: _I will set  My bow in the cloud, that henceforth ye may know  How deeper than the wreckage of your dreams  Abides My law, in beauty and in power. _          II      Yet for that exquisite balance of the mind,  He, too, must pay the price. He stood alone  Bewildered, at the sudden assault of fools  On this, his first discovery.                                \"I have lost  The most substantial blessing of my quiet  To follow a vain shadow.                           I would fain  Attempt no more. So few can understand,  Or read one thought. So many are ready at once  To swoop and sting. Indeed I would withdraw  For ever from philosophy.\" So he wrote  In grief, the mightiest mind of that new age.  Let those who'd stone the Roman Curia  For all the griefs that Galileo knew  Remember the dark hours that well-nigh quenched  The splendour of that spirit. He could not sleep.  Yet, with that patience of the God in man  That still must seek the Splendour whence it came,  Through midnight hours of mockery and defeat,  In loneliness and hopelessness and tears,  He laboured on. He had no power to see  How, after many years, when he was dead,  Out of this new discovery men should make  An instrument to explore the farthest stars  And, delicately dividing their white rays,  Divine what metals in their beauty burned,  Extort red secrets from the heart of Mars,  Or measure the molten iron in the sun.  He bent himself to nearer, lowlier, tasks;  And seeing, first, that those deflected rays,  Though it were only by the faintest bloom  Of colour, imperceptible to our eyes,  Must dim the vision of Galileo's glass,  He made his own new weapon of the sky,--  That first reflecting telescope which should hold  In its deep mirror, as in a breathless pool  The undistorted image of a star.          III      In that deep night where Galileo groped  Like a blind giant in dreams to find what power  Held moons and planets to their constant road  Through vastness, ordered like a moving fleet;  What law so married them that they could not clash  Or sunder, but still kept their rhythmic pace  As if those ancient tales indeed were true  And some great angel helmed each gliding sphere;  Many had sought an answer. Many had caught  Gleams of the truth; and yet, as when a torch  Is waved above a multitude at night,  And shows wild streams of faces, all confused,  But not the single law that knits them all  Into an ordered nation, so our skies  For all those fragmentary glimpses, whirled  In chaos, till one eagle-spirit soared,  Found the one law that bound them all in one,  And through that awful unity upraised  The soul to That which made and guides them all.    Did Newton, dreaming in his orchard there  Beside the dreaming Witham, see the moon  Burn like a huge gold apple in the boughs  And wonder why should moons not fall like fruit?  Or did he see as those old tales declare  (Those fairy-tales that gather form and fire  Till, in one jewel, they pack the whole bright world)  A ripe fruit fall from some immortal tree  Of knowledge, while he wondered at what height  Would this earth-magnet lose its darkling power?  Would not the fruit fall earthward, though it grew  High o'er the hills as yonder brightening cloud?  Would not the selfsame power that plucked the fruit  Draw the white moon, then, sailing in the blue?  Then, in one flash, as light and song are born,  And the soul wakes, he saw it--this dark earth  Holding the moon that else would fly through space  To her sure orbit, as a stone is held  In a whirled sling; and, by the selfsame power,  Her sister planets guiding all their moons;  While, exquisitely balanced and controlled  In one vast system, moons and planets wheeled  Around one sovran majesty, the sun.          IV      Light and more light! The spark from heaven was there,  The flash of that reintegrating fire  Flung from heaven's altars, where all light is born,  To feed the imagination of mankind  With vision, and reveal all worlds in one.  But let no dreamer dream that his great work  Sprang, armed, like Pallas from the Thunderer's brain.  With infinite patience he must test and prove  His vision now, in those clear courts of Truth  Whose absolute laws (bemocked by shallower minds  As less than dreams, less than the faithless faith  That fears the Truth, lest Truth should slay the dream)  Are man's one guide to his transcendent heaven;  For there's no wandering splendour in the soul,  But in the highest heaven of all is one  With absolute reality. None can climb  Back to that Fount of Beauty but through pain.  Long, long he toiled, comparing first the curves  Traced by the cannon-ball as it soared and fell  With that great curving road across the sky  Traced by the sailing moon.                              Was earth a loadstone  Holding them to their paths by that dark force  Whose mystery men have cloaked beneath a name?  Yet, when he came to test and prove, he found  That all the great deflections of the moon,  Her shining cadences from the path direct,  Were utterly inharmonious with the law  Of that dark force, at such a distance acting,  Measured from earth's own centre....  For three long years, Newton withheld his hope  Until that day when light was brought from France,  New light, new hope, in one small glistening fact,  Clear-cut as any diamond; and to him  Loaded with all significance, like the point  Of light that shows where constellations burn.  Picard in France--all glory to her name  Who is herself a light among all lands--  Had measured earth's diameter once more  With exquisite precision.                            To the throng,  Those few corrected ciphers, his results,  Were less than nothing; yet they changed the world.  For Newton seized them and, with trembling hands,  Began to work his problem out anew.  Then, then, as on the page those figures turned  To hieroglyphs of heaven, and he beheld  The moving moon, with awful cadences  Falling into the path his law ordained,  Even to the foot and second, his hand shook  And dropped the pencil.                          \"Work it out for me,\"  He cried to those around him; for the weight  Of that celestial music overwhelmed him;  And, on his page, those burning hieroglyphs  Were Thrones and Principalities and Powers...  For far beyond, immeasurably far  Beyond our sun, he saw that river of suns  We call the Milky Way, that glittering host  Powdering the night, each grain of solar blaze  Divided from its neighbour by a gulf  Too wide for thought to measure; each a sun  Huger than ours, with its own fleet of worlds,  Visible and invisible. Those bright throngs  That seemed dispersed like a defeated host  Through blindly wandering skies, now, at the word  Of one great dreamer, height o'er height revealed  Hints of a vaster order, and moved on  In boundless intricacies of harmony  Around one centre, deeper than all suns,  The burning throne of God.            V      He could not sleep. That intellect, whose wings  Dared the cold ultimate heights of Space and Time  Sank, like a wounded eagle, with dazed eyes  Back, headlong through the clouds to throb on earth.  What shaft had pierced him? That which also pierced  His great forebears--the hate of little men.  They flocked around him, and they flung their dust  Into the sensitive eyes and laughed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#14)"],[1,"at, so far from knowing all, he knew nothing whatever, except  the one fact of his own ignorance. Well, let us add up. Twenty years we  gave Pythagoras, the same to Plato, and so to the others. What will the  total come to, if we assume only ten schools?    _Her_. Over two hundred years.    _Ly_. Shall we deduct a quarter of that, and say a hundred and fifty  will do? or can we halve it?    _Her_. You must decide about that; but I see that, at the best, it  will be but few who will get through the course, though they begin  philosophy and life together.    _Ly_. In that case, what are we to do? Must we withdraw our previous  admission, that no one can choose the best out of many without trying  all? We thought selection without experiment a method of inquiry  savouring more of divination than of judgement, did we not?    _Her_. Yes.    _Ly_. Without such longevity, then, it is absolutely impossible for  us to complete the series--experiment, selection, philosophy, Happiness.  Yet anything short of that is a mere game of blindman's-buff; whatever we  knock against and get hold of we shall be taking for the thing we want,  because the truth is hidden from us. Even if a mere piece of luck brings  us straight to it, we shall have no grounded conviction of our success;  there are so many similar objects, all claiming to be the real thing.    _Her_. Ah, Lycinus, your arguments seem to me more or less logical,  but--but--to be frank with you--I hate to hear you going through them and  wasting your acuteness. I suspect it was in an evil hour that I came out  to-day and met you; my hopes were almost in my grasp; and now here are  you plunging me into a slough of despond with your demonstrations; truth  is undiscoverable, if the search needs so many years.    _Ly_. My dear friend, it would be much fairer to blame your parents,  Menecrates and whatever your mother's name may have been--or indeed to go  still further back to human nature. Why did not they make you a Tithonus  for years and durability? instead of which, they limited you like other  men to a century at the outside. As for me, I have only been helping you  to deduce results.    _Her_. No, no; it is just your way; you want to crow over me; you  detest philosophy--I cannot tell why--and poke fun at philosophers.    _Ly_. Hermotimus, I cannot show what truth is, so well as wise people like  you and your professor; but one thing I do know about it, and that is that  it is not pleasant to the ear; falsehood is far more esteemed; it is  prettier, and therefore pleasanter; while Truth, conscious of its purity,  blurts out downright remarks, and offends people. Here is a case of it:  even you are offended with me for having discovered (with your assistance)  how this matter really stands, and shown that our common object is hard of  attainment. Suppose you had been in love with a statue and hoped to win  it, under the impression that it was human, and I had realized that it was  only bronze or marble, and given you a friendly warning that your passion  was hopeless--you might just as well have thought I was your enemy then,  because I would not leave you a prey to extravagant and impracticable  delusions.    _Her_. Well, well; are we to give up philosophy, then, and idle our  lives away like the common herd?    _Ly_. What have I said to justify that? My point is not that we are  to give up philosophy, but this: whereas we are to pursue philosophy, and  whereas there are many roads, each professing to lead to philosophy and  Virtue, and whereas it is uncertain which of these is the true road,  therefore the selection shall be made with care. Now we resolved that it  was impossible out of many offers to choose the best, unless a man should  try all in turn; and then the process of trial was found to be long. What  do _you_ propose?--It is the old question again. To follow and join  philosophic forces with whomsoever you first fall in with, and let him  thank Fortune for his proselyte?    _Her_. What is the good of answering your questions? You say no one  can judge for himself, unless he can devote the life of a phoenix to  going round experimenting; and on the other hand you refuse to trust  either previous experience or the multitude of favourable testimony.    _Ly_. Where is your multitude, with knowledge and experience _of all_?  Never mind the multitude; one man who answers the description will do for  me. But if you mean the people who do not know, their mere numbers will  never persuade me, as long as they pronounce upon all from knowledge of,  at the most, one.    _Her_. Are you the only man who has found the truth, and are all the  people who go in for philosophy fools?    _Ly_. You wrong me, Hermotimus, when you imply that I put myself  above other people, or rank myself at all with those who know; you forget  what I said; I never claimed to know the truth better than others, only  confessed that I was as ignorant of it as every one else.    _Her_. Well, but, Lycinus, it may be all very well to insist on going the  round, testing the various statements, and eschewing any other method of  choice; but it is ridiculous to spend so many years on each experiment, as  though there were no such thing as judging from samples. That device seems  to me quite simple, and economical of time. There is a story that some  sculptor, Phidias, I think, seeing a single claw, calculated from it the  size of the lion, if it were modelled proportionally. So, if some one were  to let you see a man's hand, keeping the rest of his body concealed, you  would know at once that what was behind was a man, without seeing his  whole body. Well, it is easy to find out in a few hours the essential  points of the various doctrines, and, for selecting the best, these will  suffice, without any of your scrupulous exacting investigation.    _Ly_. Upon my word, how confident you are in your faculty of divining the  whole from the parts! and yet I remember being told just the  opposite--that knowledge of the whole includes that of the parts, but not  vice versa. Well, but tell me; when Phidias saw the claw, would he ever  have known it for a lion's, if he had never seen a lion? Could you have  said the hand was a man's, if you had never known or seen a man? Why are  you dumb? Let me make the only possible answer for you--that you could  _not_; I am afraid Phidias has modelled his lion all for nothing;  for it proves to be neither here nor there. What resemblance is there?  What enabled you and Phidias to recognize the parts was just your  knowledge of the wholes--the lion and the man. But in philosophy--the  Stoic, for instance--how will the part reveal the other parts to you, or  how can you conclude that they are beautiful? You do not know the whole  to which the parts belong.    Then you say it is easy to hear in a few hours the essentials of all  philosophy--meaning, I suppose, their principles and ends, their accounts  of God and the soul, their views on the material and the immaterial,  their respective identification of pleasure or goodness with the  desirable and the Happy; well, it is easy--it is quite a trifle--to  deliver an opinion after such a hearing; but really to _know_ where  the truth lies will be work, I suspect, not for a few hours, but for a  good many days. If not, what can have induced them to enlarge on these  rudiments to the tune of a hundred or a thousand volumes apiece? I  imagine they only wanted to establish the truth of those few points which  you thought so easy and intelligible. If you refuse to spend your time on  a conscientious selection, after personal examination of each and all, in  sum and in detail, it seems to me you will still want your soothsayer to  choose the best for you. It would be a fine short cut, with no  meanderings or wastings of time, if you sent for him, listened to the  summaries, and killed a victim at the end of each; by indicating in its  liver which is the philosophy for you, the God would save you a pack of  troubles.    Or, if you like, I can suggest a still simpler way; you need not shed all  this blood in sacrifice to any God, nor employ an expensive priest; put  into an urn a set of tablets, each marked with a philosopher's name, and  tell a boy (he must be quite young, and his parents both be living) to go  to the urn and pick out whichever tablet his hand first touches; and live  a philosopher ever after, of the school which then comes out triumphant.    _Her_. This is buffoonery, Lycinus; I should not have expected it of you.  Now tell me, did you ever buy wine? in person, I mean.    _Ly_. Many a time.    _Her_. Well, did you go to every wine vault in town, one after another,  tasting and comparing?    _Ly_. Certainly not.    _Her_. No; as soon as you find good sound stuff, you have only to get it  sent home.    _Ly_. To be sure.    _Her_. And from that little taste you could have answered for the quality  of the whole?    _Ly_. Yes.    _Her_. Now suppose you had gone to all the wine-merchants and said: I want  to buy a pint of wine; I must ask you, gentlemen, to let me drink the  whole of the cask which each of you has on tap; after that exhaustive  sampling, I shall know which of you keeps the best wine, and is the man  for my money. If you had talked like that, they might have laughed at  you, and, if you persisted in worrying them, have tried how you liked  water.    _Ly_. Yes; it would be no more than my deserts.    _Her_. Apply this to philosophy. What need to drink the whole cask,  when you can judge the quality of the whole from one little taste?    _Ly_. What an adept at evasion you are, Hermotimus! How you slip  through one's fingers! However, it is all the better this time; you  fancied yourself out, but you have flopped into the net again.    _Her_. What do you mean?    _Ly_. You take a thing whose nature is self-evident and universally  admitted, like wine, and argue from it to perfectly unlike things, whose"]]]
