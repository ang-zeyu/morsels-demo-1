I have only just ventured again  to set up in business. I am not going to risk my old neck again in a  hurry....\"    \"It is a matter of life and death,\" urged Agnes, as once more the tears  rushed to her pleading eyes and the look of misery settled again upon  her face.    \"Your life, citizeness?\" queried the old man, \"or that of citizen-deputy  Fabrice?\"    \"Hush!\" she broke in again, as a look of real terror now overspread her  face. Then she added under her breath: \"You know?\"    \"I know that Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines is fiancee to the  citizen-deputy Arnould Fabrice,\" rejoined the old man quietly, \"and that  it is Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines who is speaking with me now.\"    \"You have known that all along?\"    \"Ever since mademoiselle first tripped past me at the angle of the Pont  Neuf dressed in winsey kirtle and wearing sabots on her feet....\"    \"But how?\" she murmured, puzzled, not a little frightened, for his  knowledge might prove dangerous to her. She was of gentle birth, and as  such an object of suspicion to the Government of the Republic and of the  Terror; her mother was a hopeless cripple, unable to move: this together  with her love for Arnould Fabrice had kept Agnes de Lucines in France  these days, even though she was in hourly peril of arrest.    \"Tell me what has happened,\" the old man said, unheeding her last  anxious query. \"Perhaps I can help ...\"    \"Oh! you cannot--the English milor' can and will if only we could know  where he is. I thought of him the moment I received that awful man's  letter--and then I thought of you....\"    \"Tell me about the letter--quickly,\" he interrupted her with some  impatience. \"I'll be writing something--but talk away, I shall hear  every word. But for God's sake be as brief as you can.\"    He drew some paper nearer to him and dipped his pen in the ink. He  appeared to be writing under her dictation. Thin, flaky snow had begun  to fall and settled in a smooth white carpet upon the frozen ground, and  the footsteps of the passers-by sounded muffled as they hurried along.  Only the lapping of the water of the sluggish river close by broke the  absolute stillness of the air.    Agnes de Lucines' pale face looked ethereal in this framework of white  which covered her shoulders and the shawl crossed over her bosom: only  her eyes, dark, appealing, filled with a glow of immeasurable despair,  appeared tensely human and alive.    \"I had a letter this morning,\" she whispered, speaking very rapidly,  \"from citizen Heriot--that awful man--you know him?\"    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"He used to be valet in the service of deputy Fabrice. Now he, too, is a  member of the National Assembly ... he is arrogant and cruel and vile.  He hates Arnould Fabrice and he professes himself passionately in love  with me.\"    \"Yes, yes!\" murmured the old man, \"but the letter?\"    \"It came this morning. In it he says that he has in his possession a  number of old letters, documents and manuscripts which are quite enough  to send deputy Fabrice to the guillotine. He threatens to place all  those papers before the Committee of Public Safety unless ... unless  I....\"    She paused, and a deep blush, partly of shame, partly of wrath, suffused  her pale cheeks.    \"Unless you accept his grimy hand in marriage,\" concluded the man dryly.    Her eyes gave him answer. With pathetic insistence she tried now to  glean a ray of hope from the old scarecrow's inscrutable face. But he  was bending over his writing: his fingers were blue with cold, his great  shoulders were stooping to his task.    \"Citizen,\" she pleaded.    \"Hush!\" he muttered, \"no more now. The very snowflakes are made up of  whispers that may reach those bloodhounds yet. The English milor' shall  know of this. He will send you a message if he thinks fit.\"    \"Citizen--\"    \"Not another word, in God's name! Pay me five sous for this letter and  pray Heaven that you have not been watched.\"    She shivered and drew her shawl closer round her shoulders, then she  counted out five sous with elaborate care and laid them out upon the  table. The old man took up the coins. He blew into his fingers, which  looked paralysed with the cold. The snow lay over everything now; the  rough awning had not protected him or his wares.    Agnes turned to go. The last she saw of him, as she went up the Rue  Dauphine, was one broad shoulder still bending over the table, and clad  in the shabby, caped coat all covered with snow like an old Santa Claus.      II    It was half-an-hour before noon, and citizen-deputy Heriot was preparing  to go out to the small tavern round the corner where he habitually took  his dejeuner. Citizen Rondeau, who for the consideration of ten sous a  day looked after Heriot's paltry creature-comforts, was busy tidying up  the squalid apartment which the latter occupied on the top floor of a  lodging-house in the Rue Cocatrice. This apartment consisted of three  rooms leading out of one another; firstly there was a dark and narrow  antichambre wherein slept the aforesaid citizen-servant; then came a  sitting-room sparsely furnished with a few chairs, a centre table and an  iron stove, and finally there was the bedroom wherein the most  conspicuous object was a large oak chest clamped with wide iron hinges  and a massive writing-desk; the bed and a very primitive washstand were  in an alcove at the farther end of the room and partially hidden by a  tapestry curtain.    At exactly half-past seven that morning there came a peremptory knock at  the door of the antichambre, and as Rondeau was busy in the bedroom,  Heriot went himself to see who his unexpected visitor might be. On the  landing outside stood an extraordinary-looking individual--more like a  tall and animated scarecrow than a man--who in a tremulous voice asked  if he might speak with the citizen Heriot.    \"That is my name,\" said the deputy gruffly, \"what do you want?\"    He would have liked to slam the door in the old scarecrow's face, but  the latter, with the boldness which sometimes besets the timid, had  already stepped into the anti-chambre and was now quietly sauntering  through to the next room into the one beyond. Heriot, being a  representative of the people and a social democrat of the most advanced  type, was supposed to be accessible to every one who desired speech with  him. Though muttering sundry curses, he thought it best not to go  against his usual practice, and after a moment's hesitation he followed  his unwelcome visitor.    The latter was in the sitting-room by this time; he had drawn a chair  close to the table and sat down with the air of one who has a perfect  right to be where he is; as soon as Heriot entered he said placidly:    \"I would desire to speak alone with the citizen-deputy.\"    And Heriot, after another slight hesitation, ordered Rondeau to close  the bedroom door.    \"Keep your ears open in case I call,\" he added significantly.    \"You are cautious, citizen,\" merely remarked the visitor with a smile.    To this Heriot vouchsafed no reply. He, too, drew a chair forward and  sat opposite his visitor, then he asked abruptly: \"Your name and  quality?\"    \"My name is Lepine at your service,\" said the old man, \"and by  profession I write letters at the rate of five sous or so, according to  length, for those who are not able to do it for themselves.\"    \"Your business with me?\" queried Heriot curtly.    \"To offer you two thousand francs for the letters which you stole from  deputy Fabrice when you were his valet,\" replied Lepine with perfect  calm.    In a moment Heriot was on his feet, jumping up as if he had been stung;  his pale, short-sighted eyes narrowed till they were mere slits, and  through them he darted a quick, suspicious glance at the extraordinary  out-at-elbows figure before him. Then he threw back his head and laughed  till the tears streamed down his cheeks and his sides began to ache.    \"This is a farce, I presume, citizen,\" he said when he had recovered  something of his composure.    \"No farce, citizen,\" replied Lepine calmly. \"The money is at your  disposal whenever you care to bring the letters to my pitch at the angle  of the Rue Dauphine and the Quai des Augustins, where I carry on my  business.\"    \"Whose money is it? Agnes de Lucines' or did that fool Fabrice send  you?\"    \"No one sent me, citizen. The money is mine--a few savings I possess--I  honour citizen Fabrice--I would wish to do him service by purchasing  certain letters from you.\"    Then as Heriot, moody and sullen, remained silent and began pacing up  and down the long, bare floor of the room, Lepine added persuasively,  \"Well! what do you say? Two thousand francs for a packet of letters--not  a bad bargain these hard times.\"    \"Get out of this room,\" was Heriot's fierce and sudden reply.    \"You refuse?\"    \"Get out of this room!\"    \"As you please,\" said Lepine as he, too, rose from his chair. \"But  before I go, citizen Heriot,\" he added, speaking very quietly, \"let me  tell you one thing. Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines would far sooner cut  off her right hand than let yours touch it even for one instant. Neither  she nor deputy Fabrice would ever purchase their lives at such a price.\"    \"And who are you--you mangy old scarecrow?\" retorted Heriot, who was  getting beside himself with rage, \"that you should assert these things?  What are those people to you, or you to them, that you should interfere  in their affairs?\"    \"Your question is beside the point, citizen,\" said Lepine blandly; \"I am  here to propose a bargain. Had you not better agree to it?\"    \"Never!\" reiterated Heriot emphatically.    \"Two thousand francs,\" reiterated the old man imperturbably.    \"Not if you offered me two hundred thousand,\" retorted the other  fiercely. \"Go and tell that, to those who sent you. Tell them that  I--Heriot--would look upon a fortune as mere dross against the delight  of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#14)"],[1," with great animation, clinching  his fist, and extending his arm--darn it all, it fairly  makes my dander rise, to see the nasty idle loungin good  for nothin do little critters--they aint fit to tend a  bear trap, I vow. They ought to be quilted round and  round a room, like a lady's lap dog, the matter of two  hours a day, to keep them from dyin of apoplexy. Hush,  hush, said I, Mr. Slick, you forget. Well, said he,  resuming his usual composure--well, it's enough to make  one vexed though, I declare--is'nt it?    Mr. Slick has often alluded to this subject, and always  in a most decided manner; I am inclined to think he is  right. Mr. Howe's papers on the rail road I read till I  came to his calculations, but I never could read figures,  'I can't cypher,' and there I paused; it was a barrier:  I retreated a few paces, took a running leap, and cleared  the whole of them. Mr. Slick says he has UNDER and not  OVER rated its advantages. He appears to be such a shrewd,  observing, intelligent man, and so perfectly at home on  these subjects, that I confess I have more faith in this  humble but eccentric Clockmaker, than in any other man  I have met with in this Province. I therefore pronounce  'there will be a rail road.'    No. XIV    Sayings and Doings in Cumberland.    I reckon, said the Clockmaker, as we strolled through  Amherst, you have read Hook's story of the boy that one  day asked one of his father's guests who his next door  neighbor was, and when he heerd his name, asked him if  he warnt a fool. No, my little feller, said he, he beant  a fool, he is a most particular sensible man; but why  did you ax that are question? Why, said the little boy,  mother said tother day you were next door to a fool, and  I wanted to know who lived next door to you. His mother  felt pretty ugly, I guess, when she heerd him run right  slap on that are breaker. Now these Cumberland folks have  curious next door neighbors, too; they are placed by  their location right atwixt fire and water; they have  New Brunswick politics on one side, and Nova Scotia  politics on tother side of them, and Bay Fundy and Bay  Varte on tother two sides; they are actilly in hot water;  they are up to their croopers in politics, and great  hands for talking of House of Assembly, political Unions,  and what not. Like all folks who wade so deep, they can't  always tell the natur of the ford. Sometimes they strike  their shins agin a snag of a rock; at other times they  go whap into a quicksand, and if they don't take special  care they are apt to go souse over head and ears into  deep water. I guess if they'd talk more of ROTATIONS,  and less of ELECTIONS, more of them are DYKES, and less  of BANKS, and attend more to TOP-DRESSING, and lees to  RE-DRESSING, it ed be better for 'em. Now you mention  the subject, I think I have observed, said I, that there  is a great change in your countrymen in that respect.  Formerly, whenever you met an American, you had a dish  of politics set before you, whether you had an appetite  for it or not; but lately I have remarked they seldom  allude to it. Pray to what is this attributable? I guess,  said he, they have enough of it to home, and are sick of  the subject. They are cured the way our pastry cooks cure  their prentices of stealing sweet notions out of their  shops. When they get a new prentice they tell him he must  never so much as look at all them are nice things; and  if he dares to lay the weight of his finger upon one of  them, they'll have him up for it before a justice; they  tell him its every bit and grain as bad as stealing from  a till. Well, that's sure to set him at it, just as a  high fence does a breachy ox, first to look over it, and  then to push it down with its rump; its human natur.  Well, the boy eats and eats till he cant eat no longer,  and then he gets sick at his stomach, and hates the very  sight of sweetmeats arterwards. We've had politics with  us, till we're dog sick of 'em, I tell you. Besides, I  guess we are as far from perfection as when we set out  a roin for it. You may get PURITY OF ELECTION, but how  are you to get PURITY OF MEMBERS? It would take a great  deal of cyphering to tell that. I never see'd it yet,  and never heerd tell of one who had see'd it. The best  member I een amost ever seed was John Adams. Well, John  Adams could no more plough a straight furrow in politics  than he could haul the plough himself. He might set out  straight at beginnin for a little way, but he was sure  to get crooked afore he got to the eend of the ridge--and  sometimes he would have two or three crooks in it. I used  to say to him, how on airth is it, Mr. Adams, (for he  was no way proud like, though he was president of our  great nation--and it is allowed to be the greatest nation  in the world, too--for you might see him sometimes of an  arternoon, a swimmin along with the boys in the Potomac;  I do believe that's the way he larned to give the folks  the dodge so spry;) well, I used to say to him, how on  airth is it, Mr. Adams, you can't make straight work on  it? He was a grand hand at an excuse, (though minister  used to say that folks that were good at an excuse, were  seldom good for nothin else); sometimes, he said, the  ground was so tarnation stony, it throwed the plough out;  at other times he said the off ox was such an ugly wilful  tempered critter, there was no doin nothin with him; or  that there was so much machinery about the plough, it  made it plagy hard to steer; or may be it was the fault  of them that went afore him, that they laid it down so  bad; unless he was hired for another term of four years,  the work wouldn't look well; and if all them are excuses  wouldn't do, why he would take to scolding the nigger  that drove the team--throw all the blame on him, and  order him to have an everlastin lacin with the cowskin.  You might as well catch a weazel asleep as catch him. He  had somethin the matter with one eye--well, he knew I  know'd that when I was a boy; so one day, a feller  presented a petition to him, and he told him it was very  affectin. Says he, it fairly draws tears from me, and  his weak eye took to lettin off its water like statiee  so as soon as the chap went, he winks to me with tother  one, quite knowin, as much as to say, YOU SEE ITS ALL IN  MY EYE, Slick, but don't let on to any one about it, that  I said so. That eye was a regular cheat, a complete New  England wooden nutmeg. Folks said Mr. Adams was a very  tender hearted man. Perhaps he was, but I guess that eye  didn't pump its water out o' that place.    Members in general aint to be depended on, I tell you.  Politics makes a man as crooked as a pack does a pedlar;  not that they are so awful heavy, neither, but it TEACHES  A MAN TO STOOP IN THE LONG RUN. Arter all, there's not  that difference in 'em (at least there aint in Congress)  one would think, for if one of them is clear of one vice,  why, as like as not, he has another fault just as bad.  An honest farmer, like one of these Cumberland folks,  when he goes to choose atwixt two that offers for votes,  is jist like the flying fish. That are little critter is  not content to stay to home in the water, and mind its  business, but he must try his hand at flyin, and he is  no great dab at flyin, neither. Well, the moment he's  out of water, and takes to flyin, the sea fowl are arter  him, and let him have it; and if he has the good luck to  escape them, and makes a dive into the sea, the dolphin,  as like as not, has a dig at him, that knocks more wind  out of him than he got while aping the birds, a plagy  sight. I guess the Blue Noses know jist about as much  about politics as this foolish fish knows about flyin.  All critters in natur are better in their own element.    It beats cock fightin, I tell you, to hear the Blue Noses,  when they get together, talk politics. They have got  three or four evil spirits, like the Irish Banshees, that  they say cause all the mischief in the Province--the  Council, the Banks, the House of Assembly and the Lawyers.  If a man places a higher valiation on himself than his  neighbors do, and wants to be a magistrate before he is  fit to carry the ink horn for one, and finds himself  safely delivered of a mistake, he says it is all owing  to the Council. The members are cunnin critters, too;  they know this feelin, and when they come home from  Assembly, and people ax 'em \"where are all them are fine  things you promised us?\" why, they say, we'd a had 'em  all for you, but for that etarnal Council, they nullified  all we did. The country will come to no good till them  chaps show their respect for it, by covering their bottoms  with homespun. If a man is so tarnation lazy he wont  work, and in course has no money, why he says its all  owin to the banks, they wont discount, there's no money,  they've ruined the Province. If there beant a road made  up to every citizen's door, away back to the woods (who  as like as not has squatted there) why he says the House  of Assembly have voted all the money to pay great men's  salaries, and there's nothin left for poor settlers, and  cross roads. Well, the lawyers come in for their share  of cake and ale, too; if they don't catch it, its a pity.    There was one Jim Munroe of Onion County, Connecticut,  a desperate idle fellow, a great hand at singin songs,  a skatin, drivin about with the galls, and so on. Well,  if any body's windows were broke, it was Jim Munroe--and  if there were any youngsters in want of a father, they  were sure to be poor Jim's. Jist so it is with the lawyers  here; they stand Godfathers for every misfortune that  happens in the country. When there is a mad dog a goin  about, every dog that barks is said to be bit by the mad  one, so he gets credit for all the mischief that every  dog does for three months to come. So every feller that  goes yelpin home from a court house, smartin from the  law, swears he is bit by a lawyer."]]]
