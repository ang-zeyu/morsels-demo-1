The cacique sent him two thousand Indians with a present,  to wit, many conies and partridges, bread of maize, two hens and  many dogs.\" [Footnote: Historical Collections of Louisiana, part ii.  A Narrative of the Expedition of Hernando de Soto into Florida, by a  Gentleman of Elvas, p. 139.]    Again: \"Two leagues before he came to Chiaha, there met him fifteen  Indians loaded with maize which the cacique had sent; and they told  him on his behalf that he waited his coming with twenty barns full  of it.\" [Footnote: 3 ib. p. 147.] \"At Cora the chief commanded his  Indians to void their houses, wherein the governor and his men were  lodged. There was in the barns and in the fields great store of  maize and French beans. The country was greatly inhabited with many  great towns and many sown fields which reached from one to the other\".  [Footnote: ib. p 152.]    After crossing the Mississippi, of which De Soto was the first  discoverer, he \"rested in Pacaha forty days, in all which time the  two caciques served him with great store of fish, mantles, and skins,  and strove who should do him greatest service\". [Footnote: ib. p.  175.]    The justly celebrated Moravian missionary, John Heckewelder, obtained,  through a long experience, an intimate acquaintance with the manners  and customs of the Indian tribes. He was engaged in direct  missionary labor, among the Delawares and Munsees chiefly, for  fifteen years (1771-1786) on the Muskingum and Cuyahoga in Ohio,  where, besides the Delawares and Munsees, he came in contact with  Tuscaroras and other tribes of Iroquois lineage. He was conversant  with the usages and customs of the Indian tribes of Pennsylvania and  New York. His general knowledge justifies the title of his work,  \"History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations, who once  inhabited Pennsylvania and the neighboring States,\" and gives the  highest credibility to his statements.    In discussing the general character of the Indians, he remarks as  follows: \"They think that he [the Great Spirit] made the earth and  all that it contains for the common good of mankind; when he stocked  the country that he gave them with plenty of game, it was not for  the benefit of a few, but of all. Everything was given in common to  the sons of men. Whatever liveth on the land, whatsoever groweth out  of the earth, and all that is in the rivers and waters flowing  through the same, was given jointly to all, and ever one is entitled  to his share. From this principle hospitality flows as from its  source. With them it is not a virtue, but a strict duty; hence they  are never in search of excuses to avoid giving, but freely supply  their neighbors' wants from the stock prepared for their own use.  They give and are hospitable to all without exception, and will  always share with each other and often with the stranger to the last  morsel. They rather would lie down themselves on an empty stomach  than have it laid to their charge that they had neglected their duty  by not satisfying the wants of the stranger, the sick, or the needy.  The stranger has a claim to their hospitality, partly on account of  his being at a distance from his family and friends, and partly  because he has honored them with his visit and ought to leave them  with a good impression on his mind; the sick and the poor because  they have a right to be helped out of the common stock, for if the  meat they have been served with was taken from the woods it was  common to all before the hunter took it; if corn or vegetables, it  had grown out of the common ground, yet not by the power of man, but  by that of the Great Spirit.\" [Footnote: Heckewelder, Indian Nations,  Philadelphia ed., 1876, p. 101]    This is a clear and definite statement of the principle of  hospitality as it was observed by the Indian tribes at the epoch of  their discovery, with the Indians' reasons on which the obligations  rested. We recognize in this law of hospitality a conspicuous virtue  of mankind in barbarism.    Lewis and Clarke refer to the usages of the tribes of the Missouri,  which were precisely the same as those of the Iroquois. \"It is the  custom of all the nations on the Missouri,\" they remark, \"to offer  every white man food and refreshments when he first enters their  tents\". [Footnote: Travels, etc., London edition, 1814, p. 649.]    This was simply applying their rules of hospitality among themselves  to their white visitors.    About 1837-1838 George Catlin wintered at the Mandan Village, on the  Upper Missouri. He was an accurate and intelligent observer, and his  work on the \"Manners and Customs of the North American Indians\" is a  valuable contribution to American ethnography. The principal Mandan  village, which then contained fifty houses and fifteen hundred people,  was surrounded with a palisade. It was well situated for game, but  they did not depend exclusively upon this source of subsistence.  They cultivated maize, squashes, pumpkins, and tobacco in garden beds,  and gathered wild berries and a species of turnip on the prairies.  \"Buffalo meat, however,\" says Mr. Catlin, \"is the great staple and  staff of life in this country, and seldom, if ever, fails to afford  them an abundant means of subsistence.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"During the summer and fall months they use the meat fresh, and cook  it in a great variety of ways--by roasting, broiling, boiling,  stewing, smoking, &c., and, by boiling the ribs and joints with the  marrow in them, make a delicious soup, which is universally used and  in vast quantities. The Mandans, I find, have no regular or stated  times for their meals, but generally eat about twice in the  twenty-four hours. The pot is always boiling over the fire, and any  one who is hungry, either from the household or from any other part  of the village, has a right to order it taken off and to fall too,  eating as he pleases. Such is an unvarying custom among the North  American Indians, and I very much doubt whether the civilized world  have in their institutions any system which can properly be called  more humane and charitable. Every man, woman, or child in Indian  communities is allowed to enter any one's lodge, and even that of  the chief of the nation, and eat when they are hungry, provided  misfortune or necessity has drawn them to it. Even so can the  poorest and most worthless drone of the nation, if he is too lazy to  hunt or to supply himself; he can walk into any lodge, and every one  will share with him as long as there is anything to eat. He, however,  who thus begs when he is able to hunt, pays dear for his meat, for  he is stigmatized with the disgraceful epithet of poltroon and beggar.\"  [Footnote: Manners and Customs of the North American Indians,  Hazard's edition, 1857, i, 200.] Mr. Catlin puts the case rather  strongly when he turns the free hospitality of the household into a  right of the guest to entertainment independently of their consent.  It serves to show that the provisions of the household, which as he  elsewhere states, consisted of from twenty to forty persons, were  used in common, and that each household shared their provisions in  the exercise of hospitality with any inhabitant of the village who  came to the house hungry, and with strangers from other tribes as  well. Moreover, he speaks of this hospitality as universal amongst  the Indian tribes. It is an important statement, because few men in  the early period of intercourse with the western tribes have  traveled so extensively among them.    The tribes of the Columbia Valley lived upon fish, bread-roots, and  game. Food was abundant at certain seasons, but there were times of  scarcity even in this favored area. Whatever provisions they had  were shared freely with each other, with guests, and with strangers.  Lewis and Clarke, in 1804-1806, visited in their celebrated  expedition the tribes of the Missouri and of the Valley of the  Columbia. They experienced the same generous hospitality whenever  the Indians possessed any food to offer, and their account is the  first we have at all special of these numerous tribes. Frequent  references are made to their hospitality. The Nez Perces \"set before  them a small piece of buffalo meat, some dried salmon, berries, and  several kinds of roots. Among these last is one which is round and  much like an onion in appearance and sweet to the taste. It is  called quamash, and is eaten either in its natural state or boiled  into a kind of soup or made into a cake, which is then called pasheco.  After the long abstinence, this was a sumptuous treat; and we  returned the kindness of the people by a few small presents, and  then went on in company with one of the chiefs to a second village,  in the same plain at a distance of two miles. Here the party was  treated with great kindness and passed the night.\" [Footnote: Travels,  etc., p. 330.]    Of another tribe they remark, \"As we approached the village most of  the women, though apprised of our being expected, fled with their  children into the neighboring woods. The men, however, received us  without any apprehension, and gave us a plentiful supply of  provisions. The plains were now crowded with Indians who came to see  the persons of the whites, and the strange things they brought with  them; but as our guide was perfectly a stranger to their language we  could converse by signs only.\" [Footnote: Travels, etc., p. 334.]    The Indians of the Columbia, unlike the tribes previously named,  boiled their food in wooden vessels, or in ground cavities lined  with skins, by means of heated stones. They were ignorant of pottery.  \"On entering one of their houses he [Captain Clarke] found it  crowded with men, women, and children, who immediately provided a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#14)"],[1,": he is hounded out,  his only hope of rest being Apollo's sacred shrine. The play ends with a  note of hopelessness, of calamity without end.    After the _Agamemnon_ this play reads weak indeed. Yet it displays  two marked characteristics. It is full of vigorous action; the plot is  quickly conceived and quickly consummated; the business is soon over.  Further, Aeschylus has discovered yet another source of tragic power,  the conflict of duties. Orestes has to choose between obedience to  Apollo and reverence for his mother. That these duties are incompatible  is clear; whichever he performed, punishment was bound to follow. It  is in this enforced choice between two evils that the pathos of life is  often to be found; that Aeschylus should have so faithfully depicted it  is a great contribution to the growth of drama.    The concluding play, the _Eumenides_, calls for a briefer description.  It opens with one of the most awe-inspiring scenes which the imagination  of man has conceived. The priestess of Delphi finds a man sitting as  a suppliant at the central point of the earth, his hands dripping with  blood, a sword and an olive branch in his hand. Round him is slumbering  a troop of dreadful forms, beings from darkness, the avengers. When the  scene is disclosed, Apollo himself is seen standing at Orestes' side. He  urges Hermes to convey the youth with all speed to Athens where he is to  clasp the ancient image of Athena. Immediately the ghost of Clytemnestra  arises; waking the sleeping forms, she bids them fly after their victim.  They arise and confront Apollo, a younger deity, whom they reproach for  protecting one who should be abandoned to them. Apollo replies with a  charge that they are prejudiced in favour of Clytemnestra, whom, though  a murderess, they had never tormented.    The scene rapidly changes to Athens, where Orestes calls upon Athena;  confident in the privilege of their ancient office the Chorus awaits the  issue. The goddess appears and consents to try the case, the Council  of the Areopagus acting as a jury. Apollo first defends his action  in saving Orestes, asserting that he obeys the will of Zeus. The main  question is, which of the two parents is more to be had in honour?    Athena herself had no mother; the female is merely the nurse of the  child, the father being the true generative source. The Chorus points  out that the sin of slaying a husband is not the same as that of  murdering a mother, for the one implies kinship, while the other does  not. Athena advises the Court to judge without fear or favour. When the  votes are counted, it is found that they are exactly even. The goddess  casts her vote for Orestes, who is thus saved and restored.    The Chorus threaten that ruin and sterility shall visit Athena's city;  they are elder gods, daughters of night, and are overridden by younger  deities. But Athena by the power of her persuasion offers them a full  share in all the honours and wealth of Attica if they will consent  to take up their abode in it. They shall be revered by countless  generations and will gain new dignities such as they could not have  otherwise obtained. Little by little their resentment is overcome; they  are conducted to their new home to change their name and become the  kindly goddesses of the land.    The boldness of Aeschylus is most evident in this play. Not content with  raising a ghost as he had done in the _Persae_, he actually shows upon  a public stage the two gods whom the Athenians regarded as the special  objects of their worship. More than this, he has brought to the light  the dark powers of the underworld in all their terrors; it is said that  at the sight of them some of the women in the audience were taken with  the pangs of premature birth. The introduction of these supernatural  figures was the most vivid means at Aeschylus' disposal for bringing  home to the minds of his contemporaries the seriousness of the dramatic  issue. It will be remembered that the _Prometheus_ was the last echo of  the contest between two races of gods. The same strain of thought has  made the poet represent the struggle in the mind of Orestes as a trial  between the primeval gods and the newer stock; the result was the  same, the older and perhaps more terrifying deities are beaten, being  compelled to change their names and their character to suit the gentler  spirit which a religion takes to itself as it develops. At any rate,  such is Aeschylus' solution of the eternal question, \"What atonement can  be made for bloodshed and how can it be secured?\" The problem is of the  greatest interest; it may be that there is no real answer for it, but it  is at least worth while to examine the attempts which have been made to  solve it.    Before we begin to attempt an estimate of Aeschylus it is well to face  the reasons which make Greek drama seem a thing foreign to us. We are at  times aware that it is great, but we cannot help asking, \"Is it  real?\" Modern it certainly is not. In the first place, the Chorus was  all-important to the Greeks, but is non-existent with us. To them drama  was something more than action, it was music and dancing as well. Yet  as time went on, the Greeks themselves found the Chorus more and more  difficult to manage and it was discarded as a feature of the main plot.  Only in a very few instances could a play be constructed in such  a manner as to allow the Chorus any real influence on the story.  Aeschylus' skill in this branch of his art is really extraordinary; the  Chorus does take a part, and a vital part too, in the play. Again,  the number of Greek actors was limited, whereas in a modern play  their number is just as great as suits playwright's convenience or his  capacity. The impression then of a Greek play is that it is a somewhat  thin performance compared with the vivacity and complexity of the great  Elizabethans. The plot, where it exists, seems very narrow in Attic  drama; it could hardly be otherwise in a society which was content with  a repeated discussion of a rather close cycle of heroic legends.  Yet here, too, we might note how Aeschylus trod out of the narrow  circumscribed round, notably in the _Prometheus_ and the _Persoe_.  Lastly, the Greek play is short when compared with a full-bodied  five-act tragedy. It must be remembered, however, that very often  these plays are only a third part of the real subject dealt with by the  playwright.    All Greek tragedy is liable to these criticisms; it is not fair to judge  a process just beginning by the standards of an art which thinks itself  full-blown after many centuries of history. Considering the meagre  resources available for Aeschylus--the masks used by Greek actors made  it impossible for any of them to win a reputation or to add to the fame  of a play--we ought to admire the marvellous success he achieved. His  defects are clear enough; his teaching is a little archaic, his  plots are sometimes weak or not fully worked out, his tendency is to  description instead of vigorous action, he has a superabundance of  choric matter. Sometimes it is said that the doctrine of an inherited  curse on which much of his work is written is false; let it be  remembered that week by week a commandment is read in our churches which  speaks of visiting the sins of the fathers upon the third and fourth  generation of them that hate God; all that is needed to make Aeschylus'  doctrine \"real\" in the sense of \"modern\" is to substitute the  nineteenth-century equivalent Heredity. That he has touched on a genuine  source of drama will be evident to readers of Ibsen's _Ghosts_. More  serious is the objection that his work is not dramatic at all; the  actors are not really human beings acting as such, for their wills and  their deeds are under the control of Destiny. What then shall we say of  this from Hamlet:--        \"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,      Rough-hew them as we will?\"    In this matter we are on the threshold of one of our insoluble  problems--the freedom of the will. An answer to this real fault in  Aeschylus will be found in the subsequent history of the Attic drama  attempted in the next two chapters. Suffice it to say that, whether  the will is free or not, we act as if it were, and that is enough to  represent (as Aeschylus has done) human beings acting on a stage as we  ourselves would do in similar circumstances, for the discussions about  Destiny are very often to be found in the mouths not of the characters,  but of the Chorus, who are onlookers.    The positive excellences of Aeschylus are numerous enough to make us  thankful that he has survived. His style is that of the great sublime  creators in art, Dante, Michaelangelo, Marlowe; it has many a \"mighty  line\". His subjects are the Earth, the Heavens, the things under the  Earth; more, he reveals a period of unsuspected antiquity, the present  order of gods being young and somewhat inexperienced. He carries us back  to Creation and shows us the primeval deities, Earth, Night, Necessity,  Fate, powers simply beyond the knowledge of ordinary thoughtless men.  His characters are cast in a mighty mould; he taps the deepest  tragic springs; he teaches that all is not well when we prosper. The  thoughtless, light-hearted, somewhat shallow mind which thinks it can  speak, think, and act without having to render an account needs the  somewhat stern tonic of these seven dramas; it may be chastened into  some sobriety and learn to be a little less flippant and irreverent.    Aeschylus' influence is rather of the unseen kind. His genius is of  a lofty type which is not often imitated. Demanding righteousness,  justice, piety, and humility, he belongs to the class of Hebrew prophets  who saw God and did not die.      TRANSLATIONS:--    Miss Swanwick; E. D. A.
