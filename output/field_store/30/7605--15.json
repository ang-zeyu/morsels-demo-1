Every now and then we stood,  by common consent, silent and almost breathless to listen to the  Bell-bird, a dingy little fellow, nearly as large as a thrush with the  plumage of a chaffinch, but with such a note!--how can I make you hear  its wild, sweet, plaintive tone, as a little girl of the party said,  \"just as if it had a bell in its throat;\" but indeed it would require  a whole peal of silver bells to ring such an exquisite chime. Then we  crept softly up to a low branch, to have a good look at the Tui, or  Parson-bird, most respectable and clerical-looking in its glossy black  suit, with a singularly trim and dapper air, and white wattles of very  slender feathers--indeed they are as fine as hair-curled coquettishly  at each side of his throat, exactly like bands. All the birds were  quite tame, and, instead of avoiding us, seemed inclined to examine  us minutely. Many of them have English names, which I found very  tantalising, especially when, the New Zealand Robin was announced, and  I could only see a fat little ball of a bird, with a yellowish-white  breast. Animals there are none. No quadruped is indigenous to New  Zealand, except a rat; but then, on the other hand, we are as free from  snakes and all vermin as if St. Patrick himself had lived here. Our host  has turned several pheasants into this forest, but they increase very  slowly on account of the wekas. However, the happiness of this morning  was made complete by our putting up two splendid rocketers.    We could only make our way by the paths which have been cut through  the Bush; a yard off the track it is impossible to stir for the dense  undergrowth. In the ravines and steep gullies formed by the creeks  grow masses of ferns of all sorts, spreading like large shrubs, and  contrasting by their light bright green with the black stems of the  birch-trees around them. There are a few pines in this bush, but not  many. I can give you no idea of the variety among the shrubs:  the koromika, like an Alpine rose, a compact ball of foliage; the  lance-wood, a tall, slender stem, straight as a line, with a few long  leaves at the top, turned downwards like the barb of a spear, and  looking exactly like a lance stuck into the ground; the varieties of  matapo, a beautiful shrub, each leaf a study, with its delicate tracery  of black veins on a yellow-green ground; the mappo, the gohi, and many  others, any of which would be the glory of an English shrubbery: but  they seem to require the deep shelter of their native Bush, for they  never flourish when transplanted. I noticed the slender the large trees  have of the ground, and it is not at all surprising, after such a gale  as we had three weeks ago, to see many of the finest blown down in the  clearings where the wind could reach them. They do not seem to have any  tap-root at all, merely a very insufficient network of fibres, seldom of  any size, which spreads a short way along the surface of the ground  As long as a Bush is undisturbed by civilization, it appears to be  impervious to wind or weather; but as soon as it is opened and cleared  a little, it begins to diminish rapidly. There are traces all over the  hills of vast forests having once existed; chiefly of totara, a sort  of red pine, and those about us are scattered with huge logs of this  valuable wood, all bearing traces of the action of fire; but shepherds,  and explorers on expeditions, looking for country, have gradually  consumed them for fuel, till not many pieces remain except on the  highest and most inaccessible ranges.    It was a delightful, and by no means unacceptable surprise which awaited  us on the other side, when, on emerging from a very thick part of the  Bush, we came on a lovely spot, a true \"meeting of the waters.\" Three  broad, bright creeks came rushing and tumbling down from the densely  wooded hills about to join and flow on in quite a good-sized river, amid  boulders and a great deal of hurry and fuss,--a contrast to the profound  quiet of our ramble hitherto, the silence of which was only broken by  the twitter and whistle of the birds. Never a song can you hear, only a  sweet chirrup, or two or three melodious notes. On the opposite bank of  the river there was the welcome sight of several hampers more or less  unpacked, and the gleam of a white tablecloth on the moss. Half-a-dozen  gentlemen had formed themselves into a commissariat, and were arranging  luncheon. We could see the champagne cooling in a sort of little bay,  protected by a dam of big stones from being carried down the stream. It  all looked very charming and inviting, but the next question was how  to get across the river to these good things. Twelve or fourteen feet  separated us, hungry and tired wanderers as we were, from food and rest;  the only crossing-place was some miles lower down, near the house in  fact; so even the most timid amongst us scouted the idea of retracing  our steps. The only alternative was to make a bridge: one of the  gentlemen who were with us carried an axe in case of emergency, and in a  moment we heard the sharp ringing sounds foretelling the fall of a tree.  In the mean-time, others of the party were dragging out fallen logs--of  course small and manageable ones--and laying them from one huge boulder  to another, working up to their knees in water. So many of these  prostrate trunks were \"convenient,\" that a cry soon arose to the  woodman to \"spare the trees,\" for there were quite enough on the ground.  However, two substantial poles had been felled, and these were laid over  the deepest and most dangerous part of the current. The bridge was soon  declared passable, and loud shouts from the opposite side proclaimed  that luncheon was quite ready. I was called, as having a most undeserved  reputation for \"pluck,\" to make trial of the aerial-looking fabric. I  did not like it at all, and entreated some one else to lead the forlorn  hope; so a very quiet young lady, who really possessed more courage in  her little finger than I do in my whole body, volunteered to go first.  The effect from the bank was something like tight-rope dancing, and it  was very difficult to keep one's balance. Miss Kate, our pioneer, walked  on very steadily, amid great applause, till she reached the middle of  the stream, where fortunately the water was shallow, but strewed with  masses of boulders. She paused an instant on the large rock on which the  ends of the saplings rested, and then started afresh for the last half  of her journey. The instant she put her foot on the second part of the  bridge, it gave way with a loud crash; and the poor girl, with great  presence of mind, caught at the tree she, had just crossed, and so saved  herself from a ducking. Of course, she had plenty of help in an instant,  but the difficulty was to regain any sort of footing. She could not drop  into the water, and there was apparently no way of dragging herself  up again; but one of the gentlemen crept on hands and knees along the  unbroken part of the bridge, and eventually helped her up the sides  of the large boulder which acted as a pier, and from which the log had  slipped. From the other side they now pushed across tall, slim trees,  freshly cut, and the rest of the passage was safe enough. I did not like  the mode of transit at all, though I got over without a slip, but it  requires a steady head to cross a noisy stream on two slippery round  poles--for really the trees were little thicker--laid side by side,  bending with every step. It was a great comfort to me all luncheon-time  to know that we were not to return by the same path through the Bush. We  had a good rest after lunch: I lay back on a bed of fern, watching the  numbers of little birds around us; they boldly picked up our crumbs,  without a thought of possible danger. Presently I felt a tug at the  shawl on which I was lying: I was too lazy and dreamy to turn my head,  so the next thing was a sharp dig on my arm, which hurt me dreadfully. I  looked round, and there was a weka bent on thoroughly investigating the  intruder into its domain. The bird looked so cool and unconcerned, that  I had not the heart to follow my first impulse and throw my stick at it;  but my forbearance was presently rewarded by a stab on the ankle,  which fairly made me jump up with a scream, when my persecutor  glided gracefully away among the bushes, leaving me, like Lord Ullin,  \"lamenting.\"    We sauntered home slowly, gathering armfuls of, fern and a large variety  of a stag's-head moss so common on the west coast of Scotland; and as  soon as we had had some tea, the gentlemen went off with their towels to  bathe in the creek, and the five ladies set to work at the decorations  for the ball-room, weaving wreaths and arranging enormous bouquets very  rapidly: we had such a wealth of flowers to work with that our task was  not difficult. The most amusing part of the story is, however, that the  ball took place in my bed-room! A very pompous lady of my acquaintance  always prefaces the slenderest anecdote with these words, \"And it  happened in this wise,\" so I think I shall avail myself of the _tour de  phrase_.    It happened in this wise, then:-a large well-proportioned room had been  added to the house lately; it was intended for a drawing-room, but  for some reason has only been used as a spare bed-room, but as it  may possibly return to its original destination, very little bed-room  furniture has been put in it, and many of its belongings are appropriate  to a sitting-room. We called in the servants, the light cane bedstead  was soon deposited under the shade of a tree in the garden, the  washing-stand was similarly disposed of, and an hour's work with hammer  and nails and a ball of string turned the room into a perfect bower of  ferns and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#14)"],[1,"you won't hear them.  That business is over here.  To-night they beat in Swaziland and down  into the Tonga border.  Three days more, unless you and I, Mr Crawfurd,  are extra smart, and they'll be hearing them in Durban.'    It was not till the lamp was lit, the fire burning well, and the house  locked and shuttered, that Captain Arcoll began his tale.    'First,' he said, 'let me hear what you know.  Colles told me that you  were a keen fellow, and had wind of some mystery here.  You wrote him  about the way you were spied on, but I told him to take no notice.  Your affair, Mr Crawfurd, had to wait on more urgent matters.  Now,  what do you think is happening?' I spoke very shortly, weighing my  words, for I felt I was on trial before these bright eyes.  'I think  that some kind of native rising is about to commence.'    'Ay,' he said dryly, 'you would, and your evidence would be the spying  and drumming.  Anything more?'    'I have come on the tracks of a lot of I.D.B. work in the  neighbourhood.  The natives have some supply of diamonds, which they  sell bit by bit, and I don't doubt but they have been getting guns with  the proceeds.'    He nodded, 'Have you any notion who has been engaged in the job?'    I had it on my tongue to mention Japp, but forbore, remembering my  promise.  'I can name one,' I said, 'a little yellow Portugoose, who  calls himself Henriques or Hendricks. He passed by here the day before  yesterday.'    Captain Arcoll suddenly was consumed with quiet laughter. 'Did you  notice the Kaffir who rode with him and carried his saddlebags?  Well,  he's one of my men.  Henriques would have a fit if he knew what was in  those saddlebags.  They contain my change of clothes, and other odds  and ends.  Henriques' own stuff is in a hole in the spruit.  A handy  way of getting one's luggage sent on, eh?  The bags are waiting for me  at a place I appointed.'  And again Captain Arcoll indulged his sense  of humour.  Then he became grave, and returned to his examination.    'A rising, with diamonds as the sinews of war, and Henriques as the  chief agent.  Well and good!  But who is to lead, and what are the  natives going to rise about?'    'I know nothing further, but I have made some guesses.'    'Let's hear your guesses,' he said, blowing smoke rings from his pipe.    'I think the main mover is a great black minister who calls himself  John Laputa.'    Captain Arcoll nearly sprang out of his chair.  'Now, how on earth did  you find that out?  Quick, Mr Crawfurd, tell me all you know, for this  is desperately important.'    I began at the beginning, and told him the story of what happened on  the Kirkcaple shore.  Then I spoke of my sight of him on board ship,  his talk with Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and his hurried  departure from Durban.    Captain Arcoll listened intently, and at the mention of Durban he  laughed.  'You and I seem to have been running on lines which nearly  touched.  I thought I had grabbed my friend Laputa that night in  Durban, but I was too cocksure and he slipped off.  Do you know, Mr  Crawfurd, you have been on the right trail long before me?  When did  you say you saw him at his devil-worship?  Seven years ago?  Then you  were the first man alive to know the Reverend John in his true colours.  You knew seven years ago what I only found out last year.'    'Well, that's my story,' I said.  'I don't know what the rising is  about, but there's one other thing I can tell you.  There's some kind  of sacred place for the Kaffirs, and I've found out where it is.'  I  gave him a short account of my adventures in the Rooirand.    He smoked silently for a bit after I had finished.  'You've got the  skeleton of the whole thing right, and you only want the filling up.  And you found out everything for yourself?  Colles was right; you're  not wanting in intelligence, Mr Crawfurd.'    It was not much of a compliment, but I have never been more pleased in  my life.  This slim, grizzled man, with his wrinkled face and bright  eyes, was clearly not lavish in his praise.  I felt it was no small  thing to have earned a word of commendation.    'And now I will tell you my story,' said Captain Arcoll.  'It is a long  story, and I must begin far back.  It has taken me years to decipher  it, and, remember, I've been all my life at this native business.  I  can talk every dialect, and I have the customs of every tribe by heart.  I've travelled over every mile of South Africa, and Central and East  Africa too.  I was in both the Matabele wars, and I've seen a heap of  other fighting which never got into the papers.  So what I tell you you  can take as gospel, for it is knowledge that was not learned in a day.'    He puffed away, and then asked suddenly, 'Did you ever hear of Prester  John?'    'The man that lived in Central Asia?' I asked, with a reminiscence of a  story-book I had as a boy. 'No, no,' said Mr Wardlaw, 'he means the  King of Abyssinia in the fifteenth century.  I've been reading all  about him.  He was a Christian, and the Portuguese sent expedition  after expedition to find him, but they never got there.  Albuquerque  wanted to make an alliance with him and capture the Holy Sepulchre.'    Arcoll nodded.  'That's the one I mean.  There's not very much known  about him, except Portuguese legends.  He was a sort of Christian, but  I expect that his practices were as pagan as his neighbours'.  There is  no doubt that he was a great conqueror.  Under him and his successors,  the empire of Ethiopia extended far south of Abyssinia away down to the  Great Lakes.'    'How long did this power last?' I asked wondering to what tale this was  prologue.    'That's a mystery no scholar has ever been able to fathom. Anyhow, the  centre of authority began to shift southward, and the warrior tribes  moved in that direction.  At the end of the sixteenth century the chief  native power was round about the Zambesi.  The Mazimba and the  Makaranga had come down from the Lake Nyassa quarter, and there was a  strong kingdom in Manicaland.  That was the Monomotapa that the  Portuguese thought so much of.'    Wardlaw nodded eagerly.  The story was getting into ground that he knew  about.    'The thing to remember is that all these little empires thought  themselves the successors of Prester John.  It took me a long time to  find this out, and I have spent days in the best libraries in Europe  over it.  They all looked back to a great king in the north, whom they  called by about twenty different names.  They had forgotten about his  Christianity, but they remembered that he was a conqueror.    'Well, to make a long story short, Monomotapa disappeared in time, and  fresh tribes came down from the north, and pushed right down to Natal  and the Cape.  That is how the Zulus first appeared.  They brought with  them the story of Prester John, but by this time it had ceased to be a  historical memory, and had become a religious cult.  They worshipped a  great Power who had been their ancestor, and the favourite Zulu word  for him was Umkulunkulu.  The belief was perverted into fifty different  forms, but this was the central creed--that Umkulunkulu had been the  father of the tribe, and was alive as a spirit to watch over them.    'They brought more than a creed with them.  Somehow or other, some  fetich had descended from Prester John by way of the Mazimba and Angoni  and Makaranga.  What it is I do not know, but it was always in the  hands of the tribe which for the moment held the leadership.  The great  native wars of the sixteenth century, which you can read about in the  Portuguese historians, were not for territory but for leadership, and  mainly for the possession of this fetich.  Anyhow, we know that the  Zulus brought it down with them.  They called it _Ndhlondhlo_, which  means the Great Snake, but I don't suppose that it was any kind of  snake.  The snake was their totem, and they would naturally call their  most sacred possession after it.    'Now I will tell you a thing that few know.  You have heard of Tchaka.  He was a sort of black Napoleon early in the last century, and he made  the Zulus the paramount power in South Africa, slaughtering about two  million souls to accomplish it. Well, he had the fetich, whatever it  was, and it was believed that he owed his conquests to it.  Mosilikatse  tried to steal it, and that was why he had to fly to Matabeleland.  But  with Tchaka it disappeared.  Dingaan did not have it, nor Panda, and  Cetewayo never got it, though he searched the length and breadth of the  country for it.  It had gone out of existence, and with it the chance  of a Kaffir empire.'    Captain Arcoll got up to light his pipe, and I noticed that his face  was grave.  He was not telling us this yarn for our amusement.    'So much for Prester John and his charm,' he said.  'Now I have to take  up the history at a different point.  In spite of risings here and  there, and occasional rows, the Kaffirs have been quiet for the better  part of half a century.  It is no credit to us.  They have had plenty  of grievances, and we are no nearer understanding them than our fathers  were.  But they are scattered and divided.  We have driven great wedges  of white settlement into their territory, and we have taken away their  arms.  Still, they are six times as many as we are, and they have long  memories, and a thoughtful man may wonder how long the peace will last.  I have often asked myself that question, and till lately I used to  reply, \"For ever because they cannot find a leader with the proper  authority, and they have no common cause to fight for.\" But a year or  two ago I began to change my mind.    'It is my business to act as chief Intelligence officer among the  natives.  Well, one day, I came on the tracks of a curious person.  He  was a Christian minister called Laputa, and he was going among the  tribes from Durban to the Zambesi as a roving evangelist.  I found that  "]]]
