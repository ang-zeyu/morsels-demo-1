I accompanied Sola and Dejah Thoris in a search for new quarters, which  we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more  pretentious architecture than our former habitation.  We also found in  this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly  wrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the  marble ceilings.  The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and,  unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayed  many human figures in the compositions.  These were of people like  myself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris.  They were clad  in graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels,  and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze.  The men were beardless and only a few wore arms.  The scenes depicted  for the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.    Dejah Thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as she  gazed upon these magnificent works of art, wrought by a people long  extinct; while Sola, on the other hand, apparently did not see them.    We decided to use this room, on the second floor and overlooking the  plaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining and in the  rear for the cooking and supplies.  I then dispatched Sola to bring the  bedding and such food and utensils as she might need, telling her that  I would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.    As Sola departed Dejah Thoris turned to me with a faint smile.    \"And whereto, then, would your prisoner escape should you leave her,  unless it was to follow you and crave your protection, and ask your  pardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these past  few days?\"    \"You are right,\" I answered, \"there is no escape for either of us  unless we go together.\"    \"I heard your challenge to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and I  think I understand your position among these people, but what I cannot  fathom is your statement that you are not of Barsoom.\"    \"In the name of my first ancestor, then,\" she continued, \"where may you  be from?  You are like unto my people, and yet so unlike.  You speak my  language, and yet I heard you tell Tars Tarkas that you had but learned  it recently.  All Barsoomians speak the same tongue from the ice-clad  south to the ice-clad north, though their written languages differ.  Only in the valley Dor, where the river Iss empties into the lost sea  of Korus, is there supposed to be a different language spoken, and,  except in the legends of our ancestors, there is no record of a  Barsoomian returning up the river Iss, from the shores of Korus in the  valley of Dor.  Do not tell me that you have thus returned!  They would  kill you horribly anywhere upon the surface of Barsoom if that were  true; tell me it is not!\"    Her eyes were filled with a strange, weird light; her voice was  pleading, and her little hands, reached up upon my breast, were pressed  against me as though to wring a denial from my very heart.    \"I do not know your customs, Dejah Thoris, but in my own Virginia a  gentleman does not lie to save himself; I am not of Dor; I have never  seen the mysterious Iss; the lost sea of Korus is still lost, so far as  I am concerned.  Do you believe me?\"    And then it struck me suddenly that I was very anxious that she should  believe me.  It was not that I feared the results which would follow a  general belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian heaven or hell,  or whatever it was.  Why was it, then!  Why should I care what she  thought?  I looked down at her; her beautiful face upturned, and her  wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul; and as my eyes  met hers I knew why, and--I shuddered.    A similar wave of feeling seemed to stir her; she drew away from me  with a sigh, and with her earnest, beautiful face turned up to mine,  she whispered: \"I believe you, John Carter; I do not know what a  'gentleman' is, nor have I ever heard before of Virginia; but on  Barsoom no man lies; if he does not wish to speak the truth he is  silent.  Where is this Virginia, your country, John Carter?\" she asked,  and it seemed that this fair name of my fair land had never sounded  more beautiful than as it fell from those perfect lips on that far-gone  day.    \"I am of another world,\" I answered, \"the great planet Earth, which  revolves about our common sun and next within the orbit of your  Barsoom, which we know as Mars.  How I came here I cannot tell you, for  I do not know; but here I am, and since my presence has permitted me to  serve Dejah Thoris I am glad that I am here.\"    She gazed at me with troubled eyes, long and questioningly.  That it  was difficult to believe my statement I well knew, nor could I hope  that she would do so however much I craved her confidence and respect.  I would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents, but  no man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightest  behest.    Finally she smiled, and, rising, said: \"I shall have to believe even  though I cannot understand.  I can readily perceive that you are not of  the Barsoom of today; you are like us, yet different--but why should I  trouble my poor head with such a problem, when my heart tells me that I  believe because I wish to believe!\"    It was good logic, good, earthly, feminine logic, and if it satisfied  her I certainly could pick no flaws in it.  As a matter of fact it was  about the only kind of logic that could be brought to bear upon my  problem.  We fell into a general conversation then, asking and  answering many questions on each side.  She was curious to learn of the  customs of my people and displayed a remarkable knowledge of events on  Earth.  When I questioned her closely on this seeming familiarity with  earthly things she laughed, and cried out:    \"Why, every school boy on Barsoom knows the geography, and much  concerning the fauna and flora, as well as the history of your planet  fully as well as of his own.  Can we not see everything which takes  place upon Earth, as you call it; is it not hanging there in the  heavens in plain sight?\"    This baffled me, I must confess, fully as much as my statements had  confounded her; and I told her so.  She then explained in general the  instruments her people had used and been perfecting for ages, which  permit them to throw upon a screen a perfect image of what is  transpiring upon any planet and upon many of the stars.  These pictures  are so perfect in detail that, when photographed and enlarged, objects  no greater than a blade of grass may be distinctly recognized.  I  afterward, in Helium, saw many of these pictures, as well as the  instruments which produced them.    \"If, then, you are so familiar with earthly things,\" I asked, \"why is  it that you do not recognize me as identical with the inhabitants of  that planet?\"    She smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioning  child.    \"Because, John Carter,\" she replied, \"nearly every planet and star  having atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of Barsoom,  shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me; and,  further, Earth men, almost without exception, cover their bodies with  strange, unsightly pieces of cloth, and their heads with hideous  contraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to conceive;  while you, when found by the Tharkian warriors, were entirely  undisfigured and unadorned.    \"The fact that you wore no ornaments is a strong proof of your  un-Barsoomian origin, while the absence of grotesque coverings might  cause a doubt as to your earthliness.\"    I then narrated the details of my departure from the Earth, explaining  that my body there lay fully clothed in all the, to her, strange  garments of mundane dwellers.  At this point Sola returned with our  meager belongings and her young Martian protege, who, of course, would  have to share the quarters with them.    Sola asked us if we had had a visitor during her absence, and seemed  much surprised when we answered in the negative.  It seemed that as she  had mounted the approach to the upper floors where our quarters were  located, she had met Sarkoja descending.  We decided that she must have  been eavesdropping, but as we could recall nothing of importance that  had passed between us we dismissed the matter as of little consequence,  merely promising ourselves to be warned to the utmost caution in the  future.    Dejah Thoris and I then fell to examining the architecture and  decorations of the beautiful chambers of the building we were  occupying.  She told me that these people had presumably flourished  over a hundred thousand years before.  They were the early progenitors  of her race, but had mixed with the other great race of early Martians,  who were very dark, almost black, and also with the reddish yellow race  which had flourished at the same time.    These three great divisions of the higher Martians had been forced into  a mighty alliance as the drying up of the Martian seas had compelled  them to seek the comparatively few and always diminishing fertile  areas, and to defend themselves, under new conditions of life, against  the wild hordes of green men.    Ages of close relationship and intermarrying had resulted in the race  of red men, of which Dejah Thoris was a fair and beautiful daughter.  During the ages of hardships and incessant warring between their own  various races, as well as with the green men, and before they had  fitted themselves to the changed conditions, much of the high  civilization and many of the arts of the fair-haired Martians had  become lost; but the red race of today has reached a point where it  feels that it has made up in new discoveries and in a more practical  civilization for all that lies irretrievably buried with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#14)"],[1,"the sexes among shoppers  obtained as in the nineteenth century. As we entered, Edith said that  there was one of these great distributing establishments in each ward  of the city, so that no residence was more than five or ten minutes'  walk from one of them. It was the first interior of a twentieth-century  public building that I had ever beheld, and the spectacle naturally  impressed me deeply. I was in a vast hall full of light, received not  alone from the windows on all sides, but from the dome, the point of  which was a hundred feet above. Beneath it, in the centre of the hall,  a magnificent fountain played, cooling the atmosphere to a delicious  freshness with its spray. The walls and ceiling were frescoed in mellow  tints, calculated to soften without absorbing the light which flooded  the interior. Around the fountain was a space occupied with chairs and  sofas, on which many persons were seated conversing. Legends on the  walls all about the hall indicated to what classes of commodities the  counters below were devoted. Edith directed her steps towards one of  these, where samples of muslin of a bewildering variety were displayed,  and proceeded to inspect them.    \"Where is the clerk?\" I asked, for there was no one behind the counter,  and no one seemed coming to attend to the customer.    \"I have no need of the clerk yet,\" said Edith; \"I have not made my  selection.\"    \"It was the principal business of clerks to help people to make their  selections in my day,\" I replied.    \"What! To tell people what they wanted?\"    \"Yes; and oftener to induce them to buy what they didn't want.\"    \"But did not ladies find that very impertinent?\" Edith asked,  wonderingly. \"What concern could it possibly be to the clerks whether  people bought or not?\"    \"It was their sole concern,\" I answered. \"They were hired for the  purpose of getting rid of the goods, and were expected to do their  utmost, short of the use of force, to compass that end.\"    \"Ah, yes! How stupid I am to forget!\" said Edith. \"The storekeeper and  his clerks depended for their livelihood on selling the goods in your  day. Of course that is all different now. The goods are the nation's.  They are here for those who want them, and it is the business of the  clerks to wait on people and take their orders; but it is not the  interest of the clerk or the nation to dispose of a yard or a pound of  anything to anybody who does not want it.\" She smiled as she added,  \"How exceedingly odd it must have seemed to have clerks trying to  induce one to take what one did not want, or was doubtful about!\"    \"But even a twentieth century clerk might make himself useful in giving  you information about the goods, though he did not tease you to buy  them,\" I suggested.    \"No,\" said Edith, \"that is not the business of the clerk. These printed  cards, for which the government authorities are responsible, give us  all the information we can possibly need.\"    I saw then that there was fastened to each sample a card containing in  succinct form a complete statement of the make and materials of the  goods and all its qualities, as well as price, leaving absolutely no  point to hang a question on.    \"The clerk has, then, nothing to say about the goods he sells?\" I said.    \"Nothing at all. It is not necessary that he should know or profess to  know anything about them. Courtesy and accuracy in taking orders are  all that are required of him.\"    \"What a prodigious amount of lying that simple arrangement saves!\" I  ejaculated.    \"Do you mean that all the clerks misrepresented their goods in your  day?\" Edith asked.    \"God forbid that I should say so!\" I replied, \"for there were many who  did not, and they were entitled to especial credit, for when one's  livelihood and that of his wife and babies depended on the amount of  goods he could dispose of, the temptation to deceive the customer--or  let him deceive himself--was wellnigh overwhelming. But, Miss Leete, I  am distracting you from your task with my talk.\"    \"Not at all. I have made my selections.\" With that she touched a  button, and in a moment a clerk appeared. He took down her order on a  tablet with a pencil which made two copies, of which he gave one to  her, and enclosing the counterpart in a small receptacle, dropped it  into a transmitting tube.    \"The duplicate of the order,\" said Edith as she turned away from the  counter, after the clerk had punched the value of her purchase out of  the credit card she gave him, \"is given to the purchaser, so that any  mistakes in filling it can be easily traced and rectified.\"    \"You were very quick about your selections,\" I said. \"May I ask how you  knew that you might not have found something to suit you better in some  of the other stores? But probably you are required to buy in your own  district.\"    \"Oh, no,\" she replied. \"We buy where we please, though naturally most  often near home. But I should have gained nothing by visiting other  stores. The assortment in all is exactly the same, representing as it  does in each case samples of all the varieties produced or imported by  the United States. That is why one can decide quickly, and never need  visit two stores.\"    \"And is this merely a sample store? I see no clerks cutting off goods  or marking bundles.\"    \"All our stores are sample stores, except as to a few classes of  articles. The goods, with these exceptions, are all at the great  central warehouse of the city, to which they are shipped directly from  the producers. We order from the sample and the printed statement of  texture, make, and qualities. The orders are sent to the warehouse, and  the goods distributed from there.\"    \"That must be a tremendous saving of handling,\" I said. \"By our system,  the manufacturer sold to the wholesaler, the wholesaler to the  retailer, and the retailer to the consumer, and the goods had to be  handled each time. You avoid one handling of the goods, and eliminate  the retailer altogether, with his big profit and the army of clerks it  goes to support. Why, Miss Leete, this store is merely the order  department of a wholesale house, with no more than a wholesaler's  complement of clerks. Under our system of handling the goods,  persuading the customer to buy them, cutting them off, and packing  them, ten clerks would not do what one does here. The saving must be  enormous.\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Edith, \"but of course we have never known any  other way. But, Mr. West, you must not fail to ask father to take you  to the central warehouse some day, where they receive the orders from  the different sample houses all over the city and parcel out and send  the goods to their destinations. He took me there not long ago, and it  was a wonderful sight. The system is certainly perfect; for example,  over yonder in that sort of cage is the dispatching clerk. The orders,  as they are taken by the different departments in the store, are sent  by transmitters to him. His assistants sort them and enclose each class  in a carrier-box by itself. The dispatching clerk has a dozen pneumatic  transmitters before him answering to the general classes of goods, each  communicating with the corresponding department at the warehouse. He  drops the box of orders into the tube it calls for, and in a few  moments later it drops on the proper desk in the warehouse, together  with all the orders of the same sort from the other sample stores. The  orders are read off, recorded, and sent to be filled, like lightning.  The filling I thought the most interesting part. Bales of cloth are  placed on spindles and turned by machinery, and the cutter, who also  has a machine, works right through one bale after another till  exhausted, when another man takes his place; and it is the same with  those who fill the orders in any other staple. The packages are then  delivered by larger tubes to the city districts, and thence distributed  to the houses. You may understand how quickly it is all done when I  tell you that my order will probably be at home sooner than I could  have carried it from here.\"    \"How do you manage in the thinly settled rural districts?\" I asked.    \"The system is the same,\" Edith explained; \"the village sample shops  are connected by transmitters with the central county warehouse, which  may be twenty miles away. The transmission is so swift, though, that  the time lost on the way is trifling. But, to save expense, in many  counties one set of tubes connect several villages with the warehouse,  and then there is time lost waiting for one another. Sometimes it is  two or three hours before goods ordered are received. It was so where I  was staying last summer, and I found it quite inconvenient.\"[1]    \"There must be many other respects also, no doubt, in which the country  stores are inferior to the city stores,\" I suggested.    \"No,\" Edith answered, \"they are otherwise precisely as good. The sample  shop of the smallest village, just like this one, gives you your choice  of all the varieties of goods the nation has, for the county warehouse  draws on the same source as the city warehouse.\"    As we walked home I commented on the great variety in the size and cost  of the houses. \"How is it,\" I asked, \"that this difference is  consistent with the fact that all citizens have the same income?\"    \"Because,\" Edith explained, \"although the income is the same, personal  taste determines how the individual shall spend it. Some like fine  horses; others, like myself, prefer pretty clothes; and still others  want an elaborate table. The rents which the nation receives for these  houses vary, according to size, elegance, and location, so that  everybody can find something to suit. The larger houses are usually  occupied by large families, in which there are several to contribute to  the rent; while small families, like ours, find smaller houses more  convenient and economical. It is a matter of taste and convenience  wholly. I"]]]
