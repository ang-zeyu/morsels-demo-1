[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#14)"],[1,"d, Mr Charles Lowe, has told even of the College days that he was  always supposing things to undergo some sea-change into something else,  if not \"into something rich and strange,\" this was but to add to his  sense of enjoyment, and the power of conferring delight, and the luxuries  of variety, as boys do when they let fancy loose.  And this always had,  with him, an individual reference or return.  He was thus constantly, and  latterly, half-consciously, trying to interpret himself somehow through  all the things which engaged him, and which he so transmogrified--things  that especially attracted him and took his fancy.  Thus, if it must be  confessed, that even in his highest moments, there lingers a touch--if no  more than a touch--of self-consciousness which will not allow him to  forget manner in matter, it is also true that he is cunningly conveying  traits in himself; and the sense of this is often at the root of his  sweet, gentle, naive humour.  There is, therefore, some truth in the  criticisms which assert that even \"long John Silver,\" that fine pirate,  with his one leg, was, after all, a shadow of Stevenson himself--the  genial buccaneer who did his tremendous murdering with a smile on his  face was but Stevenson thrown into new circumstances, or, as one has  said, Stevenson-cum-Henley, so thrown as was also Archer in _Weir of  Hermiston_, and more than this, that his most successful women-folk--like  Miss Grant and Catriona--are studies of himself, and that in all his  heroes, and even heroines, was an unmistakable touch of R. L. Stevenson.  Even Mr Baildon rather maladroitly admits that in Miss Grant, the Lord  Advocate's daughter, _there is a good deal of the author himself  disguised in petticoats_.  I have thought of Stevenson in many suits,  beside that which included the velvet jacket, but--petticoats!    Youth is autocratic, and can show a grand indifferency: it goes for what  it likes, and ignores all else--it fondly magnifies its favourites, and,  after all, to a great extent, it is but analysing, dealing with and  presenting itself to us, if we only watch well.  This is the secret of  all prevailing romance: it is the secret of all stories of adventure and  chivalry of the simpler and more primitive order; and in one aspect it is  true that R. L. Stevenson loved and clung to the primitive and elemental,  if it may not be said, as one distinguished writer has said, that he even  loved savagery in itself.  But hardly could it be seriously held, as Mr  I. Zangwill held:       \"That women did not cut any figure in his books springs from this same     interest in the elemental.  Women are not born, but made.  They are a     social product of infinite complexity and delicacy.  For a like reason     Stevenson was no interpreter of the modern. . . . A child to the end,     always playing at 'make-believe,' dying young, as those whom the gods     love, and, as he would have died had he achieved his centenary, he was     the natural exponent in literature of the child.\"    But there were subtly qualifying elements beyond what Mr Zangwill here  recognises and reinforces.  That is just about as correct and true as  this other deliverance:       \"His Scotch romances have been as over-praised by the zealous Scotsmen     who cry 'genius' at the sight of a kilt, and who lose their heads at a     waft from the heather, as his other books have been under-praised.  The     best of all, _The Master of Ballantrae_, ends in a bog; and where the     author aspires to exceptional subtlety of character-drawing he befogs     us or himself altogether.  We are so long weighing the brothers     Ballantrae in the balance, watching it incline now this way, now that,     scrupulously removing a particle of our sympathy from the one brother     to the other, to restore it again in the next chapter, that we end     with a conception of them as confusing as Mr Gilbert's conception of     Hamlet, who was idiotically sane with lucid intervals of lunacy.\"    If Stevenson was, as Mr Zangwill holds, \"the child to the end,\" and the  child only, then if we may not say what Carlyle said of De Quincey:  \"_Eccovi_, that child has been in hell,\" we may say, \"_Eccovi_, that  child has been in unchildlike haunts, and can't forget the memory of  them.\"  In a sense every romancer is a child--such was Ludwig Tieck, such  was Scott, such was James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.  But each is  something more--he has been touched with the wand of a fairy, and knows,  at least, some of Elfin Land as well as of childhood's home.    The sense of Stevenson's youthfulness seems to have struck every one who  had intimacy with him.  Mr Baildon writes (p. 21 of his book):       I would now give much to possess but one of Stevenson's gifts--namely,     that extraordinary vividness of recollection by which he could so     astonishingly recall, not only the doings, but the very thoughts and     emotions of his youth.  For, often as we must have communed together,     with all the shameless candour of boys, hardly any remark has stuck to     me except the opinion already alluded to, which struck me--his elder     by some fifteen months--as very amusing, that at sixteen 'we should be     men.'  _He of all mortals_, _who was_, _in a sense_, _always still a     boy_!\"    Mr Gosse tells us:       \"He had retained a great deal of the temperament of a child, and it     was his philosophy to encourage it.  In his dreary passages of bed,     when his illness was more than commonly heavy on him, he used to     contrive little amusements for himself.  He played on the flute, or he     modelled little groups and figures in clay.\"    2. One of the qualifying elements unnoted by Mr Zangwill is simply this,  that R. L. Stevenson never lost the strange tint imparted to his youth by  the religious influences to which he was subject, and which left their  impress and colour on him and all that he did.  Henley, in his striking  sonnet, hit it when he wrote:       \"A deal of Ariel, just a streak of Puck,     Much Antony, of Hamlet most of all,     _And something of the Shorter Catechist_.\"    _Something_! he was a great deal of Shorter Catechist!  Scotch Calvinism,  its metaphysic, and all the strange whims, perversities, and questionings  of \"Fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,\" which it inevitably  awakens, was much with him--the sense of reprobation and the gloom born  of it, as well as the abounding joy in the sense of the elect--the  Covenanters and their wild resolutions, the moss-troopers and their dare-  devilries--Pentland Risings and fights of Rullion Green; he not only  never forgot them, but they mixed themselves as in his very breath of  life, and made him a great questioner.  How would I have borne myself in  this or in that?  Supposing I had been there, how would it have been--the  same, or different from what it was with those that were there?  His work  is throughout at bottom a series of problems that almost all trace to  this root, directly or indirectly.  \"There, but for the grace of God,  goes John Bradford,\" said the famous Puritan on seeing a felon led to  execution; so with Stevenson.  Hence his fondness for tramps, for scamps  (he even bestowed special attention and pains on Villon, the poet-scamp);  he was rather impatient with poor Thoreau, because he was a purist  solitary, and had too little of vice, and, as Stevenson held, narrow in  sympathy, and too self-satisfied, and bent only on self-improvement.  He  held a brief for the honest villain, and leaned to him brotherly.  Even  the anecdotes he most prizes have a fine look this way--a hunger for  completion in achievement, even in the violation of fine humane feeling  or morality, and all the time a sense of submission to God's will.  \"Doctor,\" said the dying gravedigger in _Old Mortality_, \"I hae laid  three hunner an' fower score in that kirkyaird, an' had it been His  wull,\" indicating Heaven, \"I wad hae likeit weel to hae made oot the  fower hunner.\"  That took Stevenson.  Listen to what Mr Edmond Gosse  tells of his talk, when he found him in a private hotel in Finsbury  Circus, London, ready to be put on board a steamer for America, on 21st  August, 1887:       \"It was church time, and there was some talk of my witnessing his     will, which I could not do because there could be found no other     reputable witness, the whole crew of the hotel being at church.     'This,' he said, 'is the way in which our valuable city hotels--packed     no doubt with gems and jewellery--are deserted on a Sunday morning.     Some bold piratical fellow, defying the spirit of Sabbatarianism,     might make a handsome revenue by sacking the derelict hotels between     the hours of ten and twelve.  One hotel a week would enable such a man     to retire in course of a year.  A mask might perhaps be worn for the     mere fancy of the thing, and to terrify kitchen-maids, but no real     disguise would be needful.'\"    I would rather agree with Mr Chesterton than with Mr Zangwill here:       \"Stevenson's enormous capacity for joy flowed directly out of his     profoundly religious temperament.  He conceived himself as an     unimportant guest at one eternal and uproarious banquet, and instead     of grumbling at the soup, he accepted it with careless gratitude. . .     . His gaiety was neither the gaiety of the pagan, nor the gaiety of     the _bon vivant_.  It was the greater gaiety of the mystic.  He could     enjoy trifles because there was to him no such thing as a trifle.  He     was a child who respected his dolls because they were the images of     the image of God, portraits at only two removes.\"    Here, then, we have the child crossed by the dreamer and the mystic, bred  of Calvinism and speculation on human fate and chance, and on the mystery  of temperament and inheritance, and all that flows from  these--reprobation, with its dire shadows, assured Election with its  joys, etc., etc.    3.

In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion  that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it  was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for  the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of  himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest  of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as  being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of  wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue,  he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself  crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so,  led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he  set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.    The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to  his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner  eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as  best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no  closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his  ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard  which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that,  in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his  sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an  instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had  knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that  danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he  was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more  experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most  perfect construction.    He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a  real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \"tantum pellis et  ossa fuit,\" surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the  Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give  him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse  belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,  should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as  to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and  what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a  new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a  distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling  he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out,  rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his  memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his  thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack  before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks  in the world.    Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to  get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this  point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \"Don Quixote,\"  whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history  have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and  not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the  valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing  more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous,  and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to  add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha,  whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country,  and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.    So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his  hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that  nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love  with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or  fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, \"If, for my sins,  or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common  occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or  cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him,  will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that  he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a  humble, submissive voice say, 'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the  island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never  sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded  me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me  at your pleasure'?\" Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of  this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady!  There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very  good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though,  so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.  Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the  title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which  should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and  indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her  Dulcinea del Toboso--she being of El Toboso--a name, to his mind,  musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already  bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.          CHAPTER II.    WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME      These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the  execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world  was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,  grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties  to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and  without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day  (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of  armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his  buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth  upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with  what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely  did he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck  him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very  outset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that  according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms  against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a  novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield  until by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waver  in his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made  up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came  across, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read  in the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he  resolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than  an ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that  which his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of  adventures.    Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to  himself and saying, \"Who knows but that in time to come, when the  veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes  it, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do  it after this fashion? 'Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o'er the  face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,  scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to  hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn,  that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to  mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the  renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted  his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and  famous Campo de Montiel;'\" which in fact he was actually traversing.  \"Happy the age, happy the time,\" he continued, \"in which shall be made  known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble,  limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician,  whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this  wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the  constant companion of my ways and wanderings.\" Presently he broke out  again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest, \"O Princess Dulcinea, lady  of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me  forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the  presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart,  thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.\"    So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the  style of those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well  as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so  rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he  had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable  happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to  encounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm.    Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of  Puerto Lapice; others say "]]]
