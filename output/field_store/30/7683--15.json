I was whirled over Arvle Woondery, and  brought to the lands of Snith, and swept on still until I came to Kragua,  and beyond this to those bleak lands that are nearly unknown to fancy. And  we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of  Madness, and I tried to struggle against the spirits of that frightful  Emperor's men, for I heard on the other side of the ivory hills the  pittering of those beasts that prey on the mad, as they prowled up and  down. It was no fault of mine that my little lump of hashish could not  fight with their horrible spoonsful....\"    Some one was tugging at the hall-door bell. Presently a servant came and  told our host that a policeman in the hall wished to speak to him at once.  He apologised to us, and went outside, and we heard a man in heavy boots,  who spoke in a low voice to him. My friend got up and walked over to the  window, and opened it, and looked outside. \"I should think it will be a  fine night,\" he said. Then he jumped out. When we put our astonished heads  out of the window to look for him, he was already out of sight.          POOR OLD BILL      On an antique haunt of sailors, a tavern of the sea, the light of day was  fading. For several evenings I had frequented this place, in the hope of  hearing something from the sailors, as they sat over strange wines, about  a rumour that had reached my ears of a certain fleet of galleons of old  Spain still said to be afloat in the South Seas in some uncharted region.    In this I was again to be disappointed. Talk was low and seldom, and I was  about to leave, when a sailor, wearing ear-rings of pure gold, lifted up  his head from his wine, and looking straight before him at the wall, told  his tale loudly:    (When later on a storm of rain arose and thundered on the tavern's leaded  panes, he raised his voice without effort and spoke on still. The darker  it got the clearer his wild eyes shone.)    \"A ship with sails of the olden time was nearing fantastic isles. We had  never seen such isles.    \"We all hated the captain, and he hated us. He hated us all alike, there  was no favouritism about him. And he never would talk a word with any of  us, except sometimes in the evening when it was getting dark he would stop  and look up and talk a bit to the men he had hanged at the yard-arm.    \"We were a mutinous crew. But Captain was the only man that had pistols.  He slept with one under his pillow and kept one close beside him. There  was a nasty look about the isles. They were small and flat as though they  had come up only recently from the sea, and they had no sand or rocks like  honest isles, but green grass down to the water. And there were little  cottages there whose looks we did not like. Their thatches came almost  down to the ground, and were strangely turned up at the corners, and under  the low eaves were queer dark windows whose little leaded panes were too  thick to see through. And no one, man or beast, was walking about, so that  you could not know what kind of people lived there. But Captain knew. And  he went ashore and into one of the cottages, and someone lit lights  inside, and the little windows wore an evil look.    \"It was quite dark when he came aboard again, and he bade a cheery  good-night to the men that swung from the yard-arm and he eyed us in a way  that frightened poor old Bill.    \"Next night we found that he had learned to curse, for he came on a lot of  us asleep in our bunks, and among them poor old Bill, and he pointed at us  with a finger, and made a curse that our souls should stay all night at  the top of the masts. And suddenly there was the soul of poor old Bill  sitting like a monkey at the top of the mast, and looking at the stars,  and freezing through and through.    \"We got up a little mutiny after that, but Captain comes up and points  with his finger again, and this time poor old Bill and all the rest are  swimming behind the ship through the cold green water, though their bodies  remain on deck.    \"It was the cabin-boy who found out that Captain couldn't curse when he  was drunk, though he could shoot as well at one time as another.    \"After that it was only a matter of waiting, and of losing two men when  the time came. Some of us were murderous fellows, and wanted to kill  Captain, but poor old Bill was for finding a bit of an island, out of the  track of ships, and leaving him there with his share of our year's  provisions. And everybody listened to poor old Bill, and we decided to  maroon Captain as soon as we caught him when he couldn't curse.    \"It was three whole days before Captain got drunk again, and poor old Bill  and all had a dreadful time, for Captain invented new curses every day,  and wherever he pointed his finger our souls had to go; and the fishes got  to know us, and so did the stars, and none of them pitied us when we froze  on the masts or were hurried through forests of seaweed and lost our  way--both stars and fishes went about their businesses with cold,  unastonished eyes. Once when the sun had set and it was twilight, and the  moon was showing clearer and clearer in the sky, and we stopped our work  for a moment because Captain seemed to be looking away from us at the  colours in the sky, he suddenly turned and sent our souls to the Moon. And  it was colder there than ice at night; and there were horrible mountains  making shadows; and it was all as silent as miles of tombs; and Earth was  shining up in the sky as big as the blade of a scythe, and we all got  homesick for it, but could not speak nor cry. It was quite dark when we  got back, and we were very respectful to Captain all the next day, but he  cursed several of us again very soon. What we all feared most was that he  would curse our souls to Hell, and none of us mentioned Hell above a  whisper for fear that it should remind him. But on the third evening the  cabin-boy came and told us that Captain was drunk. And we all went to his  cabin, and we found him lying there across his bunk, and he shot as he had  never shot before; but he had no more than the two pistols, and he would  only have killed two men if he hadn't caught Joe over the head with the  end of one of his pistols. And then we tied him up. And poor old Bill put  the rum between the Captain's teeth, and kept him drunk for two days, so  that he could not curse, till we found a convenient rock. And before  sunset of the second day we found a nice bare island for Captain, out of  the track of ships, about a hundred yards long and about eighty wide; and  we rowed him along to it in a little boat, and gave him provisions for a  year, the same as we had ourselves, because poor old Bill wanted to be  fair. And we left him sitting comfortable with his back to a rock singing  a sailor's song.    \"When we could no longer hear Captain singing we all grew very cheerful  and made a banquet out of our year's provisions, as we all hoped to be  home again in under three weeks. We had three great banquets every day for  a week--every man had more than he could eat, and what was left over we  threw on the floor like gentlemen. And then one day, as we saw San  Huegedos, and wanted to sail in to spend our money, the wind changed round  from behind us and beat us out to sea. There was no tacking against it,  and no getting into the harbour, though other ships sailed by us and  anchored there. Sometimes a dead calm would fall on us, while fishing  boats all around us flew before half a gale, and sometimes the wind would  beat us out to sea when nothing else was moving. All day we tried, and at  night we laid to and tried again the next day. And all the sailors of the  other ships were spending their money in San Huegedos and we could not  come nigh it. Then we spoke horrible things against the wind and against  San Huegedos, and sailed away.    \"It was just the same at Norenna.    \"We kept close together now and talked in low voices. Suddenly poor old  Bill grew frightened. As we went all along the Siractic coast-line, we  tried again and again, and the wind was waiting for us in every harbour  and sent us out to sea. Even the little islands would not have us. And  then we knew that there was no landing yet for poor old Bill, and every  one upbraided his kind heart that had made them maroon Captain on a rock,  so as not to have his blood upon their heads. There was nothing to do but  to drift about the seas. There were no banquets now, because we feared  that Captain might live his year and keep us out to sea.    \"At first we used to hail all passing ships, and used to try to board them  in the boats; but there was no towing against Captain's curse, and we had  to give that up. So we played cards for a year in Captain's cabin, night  and day, storm and fine, and every one promised to pay poor old Bill when  we got ashore.    \"It was horrible to us to think what a frugal man Captain really was, he  that used to get drunk every other day whenever he was at sea, and here he  was still alive, and sober too, for his curse still kept us out of every  port, and our provisions were gone.    \"Well, it came to drawing lots, and Jim was the unlucky one. Jim only kept  us about three days, and then we drew lots again, and this time it was the  nigger. The nigger didn't keep us any longer, and we drew again, and this  time it was Charlie, and still Captain was alive.    \"As we got fewer one of us kept us longer. Longer and longer a mate used  to last us, and we all wondered how ever Captain did it. It was five weeks  over the year when we drew Mike, and he kept us for a week, and Captain  was still alive. We wondered he didn't get tired of the same old curse;  but we supposed things looked different when one is alone on an island.    \"When there was only Jakes and poor old Bill and the cabin-boy and Dick,  we didn't draw any longer. We said that the cabin-boy had had all the  luck, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#14)"],[1,"evich. After reading the paper through, he  at once wrote under it that he agreed with its purport, and then added,  after a pause:    \"All this business is very disagreeable to me, and it is unnecessary. To  insure the propagation of my ideas by taking all sorts of measures--why,  no word can perish without leaving its trace, if it expresses a truth,  and if the man who utters it believes profoundly in its truth. But all  these outward means for insuring it only come of our disbelief in what  we utter.\"    And with these words Lyoff Nikolaievich left the study.    Thereupon Mr. Strakhof began to consider what he must do next, whether  he should go back with empty hands, or whether he should argue it out.    He decided to argue it out, and endeavored to explain to my father  how painful it would be for his friends after his death to hear people  blaming him for not having taken any steps, despite his strong opinion  on the subject, to see that his wishes were carried out, and for having  thereby helped to transfer his copyrights to the members of his family.    Tolstoy promised to think it over, and left the room again.    At dinner Sofya Andreyevna \"was evidently far from having any  suspicions.\" When Tolstoy was not by, however, she asked Mr. Strakhof  what he had come down about. Inasmuch as Mr. Strakhof had other affairs  in hand besides the will, he told her about one thing and another with  an easy conscience.    Mr. Strakhof described a second visit to Yasnaya, when he came to attest  the same will as a witness.    When he arrived, he said: \"The countess had not yet come down. I  breathed again.\"    Of his departure, he said:      As I said good-by to Sofya Andreyevna, I examined her countenance  attentively. Such complete tranquillity and cordiality toward her  departing guests were written on it that I had not the smallest doubt  of her complete ignorance of what was going on.... I left the house with  the pleasing consciousness of a work well done--a work that was destined  to have a considerable historic consequence. I only felt some little  twinge within, certain qualms of conscience about the conspiratorial  character of the transaction.      But even this text of the will did not quite satisfy my father's  \"friends and advisers\"; it was redrafted for the fourth and last time in  July, 1910.    This last draft was written by my father himself in the Limonovski  Forest, two miles from the house, not far from Mr. Tchertkof's estate.    Such is the melancholy history of this document, which was destined to  have historic consequences. \"All this business is very disagreeable to  me, and it is unnecessary,\" my father said when he signed the paper that  was thrust before him. That was his real opinion about his will, and it  never altered to the end of his days.    Is there any need of proof for that? I think one need know very little  of his convictions to have no doubt about it.    Was Lyoff Nikolaievich Tolstoy likely of his own accord to have recourse  to the protection of the law? And, if he did, was he likely to conceal  it from his wife and children?    He had been put into a position from which there was absolutely no way  out. To tell his wife was out of the question; it would have grievously  offended his friends. To have destroyed the will would have been worse  still; for his friends had suffered for his principles morally, and some  of them materially, and had been exiled from Russia. He felt himself  bound to them.    And on the top of all this were his fainting fits, his increasing loss  of memory, the clear consciousness of the approach of death, and the  continually growing nervousness of his wife, who felt in her heart  of hearts the unnatural estrangement of her husband, and could not  understand it. If she asked him what it was that he was concealing from  her, he would either have to say nothing or to tell her the truth. But  that was impossible.    So it came about that the long-cherished dream of leaving Yasnaya  Polyana presented itself as the only means of escape. It was certainly  not in order to enjoy the full realization of his dream that he left his  home; he went away only as a choice of evils.    \"I am too feeble and too old to begin a new life,\" he had said to my  brother Sergei only a few days before his departure.    Harassed, ill in body and in mind, he started forth without any object  in view, without any thought-out plan, merely in order to hide himself  somewhere, wherever it might be, and get some rest from the moral  tortures which had become insupportable to him.    \"To fly, to fly!\" he said in his deathbed delirium as he lay at  Astapova.    \"Has papa considered that mama may not survive the separation from him?\"  I asked my sister Sasha on October 29, when she was on the point of  going to join him at Shamerdino.    \"Yes, he has considered all that, and still made up his mind to go,  because he thinks that nothing could be worse than the state that things  have come to here,\" she answered.    I confess that my explanation of my father's flight by no means exhausts  the question. Life is complex and every explanation of a man's conduct  is bound to suffer from one-sidedness. Besides, there are circumstances  of which I do not care to speak at the present moment, in order not to  cause unnecessary pain to people still living. It may be that if those  who were about my father during the last years of his life had known  what they were doing, things would have turned out differently.    The years will pass. The accumulated incrustations which hide the truth  will pass away. Much will be wiped out and forgotten. Among other things  my father's will will be forgotten--that will which he himself looked  upon as an \"unnecessary outward means.\" And men will see more clearly  that legacy of love and truth in which he believed deeply, and which,  according to his own words, \"cannot perish without a trace.\"    In conclusion I cannot refrain from quoting the opinion of one of my  kinsmen, who, after my father's death, read the diaries kept both by my  father and my mother during the autumn before Lyoff Nikolaievich left  Yasnaya Polyana.    \"What a terrible misunderstanding!\" he said. \"Each loved the other with  such poignant affection, each was suffering all the time on the other's  behalf, and then this terrible ending!... I see the hand of fate in  this.\"          FOOTNOTES:      [Footnote 1: The name we gave to the stone annex.]    [Footnote 2: The instinct for lime, necessary to feed their bones,  drives Russian children to nibble pieces of chalk or the whitewash off  the wall.
