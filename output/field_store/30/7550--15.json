Get up, Tubby!\"    Tubby had to be urged incessantly; exertion was not loved by him. He  would rather walk than trot; he would rather stand than walk; and he  always had the appearance of being asleep--save when he was at his  manger.    Ruth remembered that she had been warned not to go past \"the gate with  the green eyes\" and she told Helen of her promise to Doctor Davison.    \"Oh, splendid!\" cried her chum. \"I don't know anybody whom I like to  call upon in Cheslow ahead of Doctor Davison. It's almost as good as  having him come to see you when you're sick.\"    \"But I don't think,\" Ruth objected, \"that it's any fun to have any  doctor come to see one on business.\"    \"You don't half mind being ill when Doctor Davison calls,\" declared  Helen, with unabated enthusiasm. \"And when you call there! Well,\"  concluded Helen, with a sigh of anticipation, \"you'll soon know what  that means. He's got a colored Mammy for cook who makes the most  wonderful jumbles and cakes that you ever tasted--they about melt in  pour mouth!\"    Ruth soon had the opportunity of judging Mammy 'Liza's goodies for  herself, for the doctor was at home, and the girls had scarcely become  seated in his consultation room when a little colored girl with her  wool \"done\" in innumerable pigtails, like tiny horns, and sticking out  all over her brown head in every direction, came in with a tray on  which was a plate piled high with fancy cakes and two tall glasses of  yellow-gold beaten egg and milk with a dust of nutmeg floating upon  the surface of each glassful.    \"'Liza done sez as how yo'-all might be hongry aftah yo' ride,\" said  the child, timidly, and then darted out of the room before Ruth and  Helen could thank her.    They were munching the goodies when Doctor Davison came smilingly in.    \"That's Mammy 'Liza all over,\" he said, shaking his head, but with his  dark eyes twinkling. \"I try to keep my young folk in good digestion  and she is bound to make a patient of everybody who comes to see me.  Cookies and cakes and sweets are what she believes girls live for; or  else she is trying to make customers for my nasty drugs.\"    Doctor Davison seemed to have plenty of time to give to the society of  young folk who called upon him. And he showed an interest in Ruth and  her affairs which warmed our heroine's heart. He wanted to know how  she got along at school, and if it was true that she was trying to  \"make\" the High by the opening of the fall term.    \"Not that I want any of my young folk to travel the road to knowledge  too steadily, or travel it when their bodily condition is not the  best. But you are strong and well, Ruthie, and you can do a deal that  other girls of your age would find irksome. I shall be proud if you  prepare to enter the High at your age.\"    And this made Ruth feel more and more sure that Doctor Davison had  taken interest enough in her career at school to supply the pretty  frocks, one of which she was then wearing. But Aunt Alvirah had warned  her that the frocks were to remain a mystery by the special request of  the donor, and she could not ask the good old doctor anything about  them. His interest in her progress seemed to infer that he expected  Ruth to accomplish a great deal in her school, and the girl from the  Red Mill determined not to disappoint him.    When Helen told Doctor Davison where else they intended to call, he  nodded understandingly. \"That is,\" he added, \"Ruth will call on Mercy  while you do your shopping, Miss Cameron. Oh, yes! that is the better  plan. You know very well that Mercy Curtis won't want to see you,  Helen.\"    \"I don't know why not,\" said Helen, pouting. \"I know she never treats  anyone nicely, but I don't mind. If it does her good to do what Tom  calls 'bully-ragging,' I can stand it as well as Ruth--better,  perhaps.\"    \"No,\" said the doctor, gravely. \"I have told you before why you  shouldn't call there. You have everything that Mercy can possibly  desire. Comparisons with poor Mercy certainly are odious. Ruth, she  knows, is not so fortunately placed in life as yourself. She is not so  fortunately placed, indeed, as Mercy is. And Mercy is in an extremely  nervous state just now, and I do not wish her to excite herself beyond  reason.\"    \"Well, I declare,\" exclaimed Helen, but good-naturedly after all. \"I  don't like to be told I'm not wanted anywhere. But if you say so, I'll  not go with Ruth to the house.\"    Doctor Davison opened a new topic of conversation by asking after Tom.    \"Oh, his head is all healed up--you can just barely see the scar,\"  Helen declared. \"And his arm is only a little tender. We think he got  out of it very lucky indeed--thanks to Ruth here.\"    \"Yes, thanks to Ruth,\" repeated the doctor, his eyes twinkling.    Ruth was \"on pins and needles,\" as the saying is, for she very well  remembered what the injured boy had murmured, in his half conscious  state, when they brought him along the road on the stretcher. Had it  been Jabez Potter who ran down Tom Cameron and forced him down the  embankment with his motorcycle? This thought had been bobbing up in  Ruth's mind ever since she had come to the Red Mill.    She had seen her uncle driving his team of mules in one of his  reckless moods. She would never forget how the team tore down the long  hill and was forced through the flood the day the Minturn dam had  burst. Had Jabez Potter been driving through the dark road where Tom  Cameron was hurt, in any such way as that, he would have run down a  dozen cyclists without noticing them.    Fortunately Tom's injury had not been permanent. He was all right now.  Ruth felt that she must be loyal to her uncle and say nothing about  her own suspicions; but as long as the matter was discussed between  Helen and Doctor Davison she was anxious. Therefore she hurried their  departure from the kind physician's office, by rising and saying:    \"I think we would better go, Helen. You know how slow Tubby is, and  perhaps I can give the little Curtis girl some pleasure by calling on  her.\"    \"Without doubt she'll have pleasure,\" observed Helen, somewhat  bitingly. \"She is likely to scold and 'bullyrag' to her heart's  content. You're such a meek thing that you'll let her.\"    \"If that's what gives her pleasure, Helen,\" said Ruth, with a quiet  smile, \"why, I guess I can stand it for an hour.\"    Doctor Davison had risen likewise, and he went to the front door with  them, his hand resting lightly on Ruth's shoulder.    \"You have the right idea of it, Ruthie,\" he said. \"Let Mercy take her  pleasure in that way if it's all the pleasure she can get. But perhaps  a better mind as well as a better body may come to the poor child in  time.\" Then to Ruth he added, more personally: \"Remember you have a  friend in here behind the green lamps. Don't forget to come to him  with any troubles you may have. Perhaps I do not look it, but I am  something like a fairy godmother--I have a wonderful power of  transmogrification. I can often turn dark clouds inside out and show  you the silver on the other side.\"    \"I believe that, Doctor Davison,\" she whispered, and squeezed his hand  hard, running after Helen the next moment down the walk.      CHAPTER XVII     TORMENTING MERCY    After they had awakened Tubby and urged him into something resembling  a trot they got into Cheslow proper by degrees. By the light of the  very sunshiny afternoon Ruth thought the town looked far prettier than  any place she had ever seen. This side of the railroad the houses were  mostly old-fashioned, and there were few stores. There were many lawns  and pretty, old-time gardens, while the elms and maples met in green  arches overhead so that many of the streets were like rustic tunnels,  the sun sifting through the thick branches to make only a fine,  lacework pattern upon the walks and driveway.    They crossed the railroad near the station and struck into Market  Street. Ruth would not allow Helen to drive her directly to the Curtis  cottage. She had remembered Doctor Davison's words, and she thought  that perhaps Mercy Curtis might be looking from the window and see her  visitor arrive in the pony cart. So she got down at the corner,  promising to meet her friend at that spot in an hour.    She could see the pretty cottage belonging to the railroad station  agent before she had walked far. Its garden on the side was already a  bower. But the rustic arbor on which the grape vines were trained was  not yet sufficiently covered to yield any shelter from the street;  therefore Ruth did not expect to find it occupied.    Just before she reached the cottage, however, she saw two little girls  ahead of her, hesitating on the walk. They were talking seriously  together when Ruth approached within earshot, and she heard one say to  the other:    \"Now, she'll be there in the window. We mustn't notice her, no matter  what she does or says. You know what mamma said.\"    The other child was sobbing softly. \"But she made me, oh, such a face!  And she chopped her teeth at me just as though she'd bite me! I think  she's the very hatefulest thing--\"    \"Hush! she's greatly to be pitied,\" said the older sister, with an air  and in a tone that showed she copied it from the \"grown-ups\" whom she  had heard discussing poor Mercy Curtis.    \"I wish we'd gone 'round the other way,\" complained the other child.    \"Now, come on. You needn't look into the window and smile. I'll do  that.\"    \"No,\" said the little one, stubbornly. \"I'll go by on the opposite  side of the way. And you must come, too, Anna. She--she'd bite me if  she could get the chance.\"    \"Oh, well! Come on, little silly!\" said her sister, and the two  crossed over and Ruth, who watched them interestedly, saw them hurry  by the cottage with scarcely a glance at the front windows.    But Ruth could see the outline of the lame girl's figure at one of the  windows and she saw a lean fist shaken in the air at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#14)"],[1," it was agreed that they would make a forced march back through the  jungle to where they had been deserted by Jacinto.  There they would  make camp for the night, and until such time as Tolpec could return  with a force of porters.    It was not easy, that backward tramp through the jungle, especially as  night had fallen.  But the new Indian guide could see like a cat, and  led the party along paths they never could have found by themselves.  The use of their pocket electric lights was a great help, and possibly  served to ward off the attacks of jungle beasts, for as they tramped  along they could hear stealthy sounds in the underbush on either side  of the path, as though tigers were stalking them.  For there was in the  woods an animal of the leopard family, called tiger or \"tigre\" by the  natives, that was exceedingly fierce and dangerous.  But watchfulness  prevented any accident, and eventually the party reached the place  where they had left their goods.  Nothing had been disturbed, and  finally a fire was made, the tents set up and a light meal, with hot  tea served.    \"We'll get ahead of Beecher yet,\" said Tom.    \"You seem as anxious as Professor Bumper,\" observed Mr. Damon.    \"I guess I am,\" admitted Tom.  \"I want to see that idol of gold in the  possession of our party.\"    The night passed without incident, and then, telling his new friends  that he would return as soon as possible with help, Tolpec, taking a  small supply of food with him, set out through the jungle again.    As the green vines and creepers closed after him, and the explorers  were left alone with their possessions piled around them, Ned remarked:    \"After all, I wonder if it was wise to let him go?\"    \"Why not?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, maybe he only wanted to get us back here, and then he'll desert,  too.  Maybe that's what he's done now, making us lose two or three days  by inducing us to return, waiting for what will never happen--his  return with other natives.\"    A silence followed Ned's intimation.          CHAPTER XV    IN THE COILS      \"Ned, do you really think Tolpec is going to desert us?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I don't know,\" was the slowly given reply.  \"It's a possibility,  isn't it?\"    \"Yes, it is,\" broke in Professor Bumper.  \"But what if it is?  We might  as well trust him, and if he proves true, as I believe he will, we'll  be so much better off.  If he proves a traitor we'll only have lost a  few days, for if he doesn't come back we can go on again in the way we  started.\"    \"But that's just it!\" complained Tom.  \"We don't want to lose any time  with that Beecher chap on our trail.\"    \"I am not so very much concerned about him,\" remarked Professor Bumper,  dryly.    \"Why not?\" snapped out Mr. Damon.    \"Well, because I think he'll have just about as hard work locating the  hidden city, and finding the idol of gold, as we'll have.  In other  words it will be an even thing, unless he gets too far ahead of us, or  keeps us back, and I don't believe he can do that now.    \"So I thought it best to take a chance with this Indian.  He would  hardly have taken the trouble to come all the way back, and run the  risks he did, just to delay us a few days.  However, we'll soon know.  Meanwhile, we'll take it easy and wait for the return of Tolpec and his  friends.\"    Though none of them liked to admit it, Ned's words had caused his three  friends some anxiety, and though they busied themselves about the camp  there was an air of waiting impatiently for something to occur.  And  waiting is about the hardest work there is.    But there was nothing for it but to wait, and it might be at least a  week, Professor Bumper said, before the Indian could return with a  party of porters and mules to move their baggage.    \"Yes, Tolpec has not only to locate the settlement,\" Tom admitted, \"but  he must persuade the natives to come back with him.  He may have  trouble in that, especially if it is known that he has left Jacinto,  who, I imagine, is a power among the tribes here.\"    But there were only two things left to do--wait and hope.  The  travelers did both.  Four days passed and there was no sign of Tolpec.  Eagerly, and not a little anxiously, they watched the jungle path along  which he had disappeared.    \"Oh, come on!\" exclaimed Tom one morning, when the day seemed a bit  cooler than its predecessor.  \"Let's go for a hunt, or something!  I'm  tired of sitting around camp.\"    \"Bless my watch hands! So am I!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Let's all go for a  trip.  It will do us good.\"    \"And perhaps I can get some specimens of interest,\" added Professor  Bumper, who, in addition to being an archaeologist, was something of a  naturalist.    Accordingly, having made everything snug in camp, the party, Tom and  Ned equipped with electric rifles, and the professor with a butterfly  net and specimen boxes, set forth.  Mr. Damon said he would carry a  stout club as his weapon.    The jungle, as usual, was teeming with life, but as Ned and Tom did not  wish to kill wantonly they refrained from shooting until later in the  day.  For once it was dead, game did not keep well in that hot climate,  and needed to be cooked almost immediately.    \"We'll try some shots on our back trip,\" said the young inventor.    Professor Bumper found plenty of his own particular kind of \"game\"  which he caught in the net, transferring the specimens to the boxes he  carried.  There were beautiful butterflies, moths and strange bugs in  the securing of which the scientist evinced great delight, though when  one beetle nipped him firmly and painfully on his thumb his involuntary  cry of pain was as real as that of any other person.    \"But I didn't let him get away,\" he said in triumph when he had dropped  the clawing insect into the cyanide bottle where death came painlessly.  \"It is well worth a sore thumb.\"    They wandered on through the jungle, taking care not to get too far  from their camp, for they did not want to lose their way, nor did they  want to be absent too long in case Tolpec and his native friends should  return.    \"Well, it's about time we shot something, I think,\" remarked Ned, when  they had been out about two hours.  \"Let's try for some of these wild  turkeys.  They ought to go well roasted even if it isn't Thanksgiving.\"    \"I'm with you,\" agreed Tom.  \"Let's see who has the best luck.  But  tone down the charge in your rifle and use a smaller projectile, or  you'll have nothing but a bunch of feathers to show for your shot.  The  guns are loaded for deer.\"    The change was made, and once more the two young men started off, a  little ahead of Professor Bumper and Mr. Damon.  Tom and Ned had not  gone far, however, before they heard a strange cry from Mr. Damon.    \"Tom! Ned!\" shouted the eccentric man, \"Here's a monster after me! Come  quick!\"    \"A tiger!\" ejaculated Tom, as he began once more to change the charge  in his rifle to a larger one, running back, meanwhile, in the direction  of the sound of the voice.    There were really no tigers in Honduras, the jaguar being called a  tiger by the natives, while the cougar is called a lion.  The presence  of these animals, often dangerous to man, had been indicated around  camp, and it was possible that one had been bold enough to attack Mr.  Damon, not through hunger, but because of being cornered.    \"Come on, Ned!\" cried Tom.  \"He's in some sort of trouble!\"    But when, a moment later, the young inventor burst through a fringe of  bushes and saw Mr. Damon standing in a little clearing, with upraised  club, Tom could not repress a laugh.    \"Kill it, Tom! Kill it!\" begged the eccentric man.  \"Bless my insurance  policy, but it's a terrible beast!\"    And so it was, at first glance.  For it was a giant iguana, one of the  most repulsive-looking of the lizards.  Not unlike an alligator in  shape, with spikes on its head and tail, with a warty, squatty  ridge-encrusted body, a big pouch beneath its chin, and long-toed  claws, it was enough to strike terror into the heart of almost any one.  Even the smaller ones look dangerous, and this one, which was about  five feet long, looked capable of attacking a man and injuring him.  As  a matter of fact the iguanas are harmless, their shape and coloring  being designed to protect them.    \"Don't be afraid, Mr. Damon,\" called Tom, still laughing.  \"It won't  hurt you!\"    \"I'm not so positive of that.  It won't let me pass.\"    \"Just take your club and poke it out of the way,\" the young inventor  advised.  \"It's only waiting to be shoved.\"    \"Then you do it, Tom.  Bless my looking glass, but I don't want to go  near it! If my wife could see me now she'd say it served me just right.\"    Mr. Damon was not a coward, but the giant iguana was not pleasant to  look at.  Tom, with the butt of his rifle, gave it a gentle shove,  whereupon the creature scurried off through the brush as though glad to  make its escape unscathed.    \"I thought it was a new kind of alligator,\" said Mr. Damon with a sigh  of relief.    \"Where is it?\" asked Professor Bumper, coming up at this juncture.  \"A  new species of alligator?  Let me see it!\"    \"It's too horrible,\" said Mr. Damon.  \"I never want to see one again.  It was worse than a vampire bat!\"    Notwithstanding this, when he heard that it was one of the largest  sized iguanas ever seen, the professor started through the jungle after  it.    \"We can't take it with us if we get it,\" Tom called after his friend.    \"We might take the skin,\" answered the professor.  \"I have a standing  order for such things from one of the museums I represent.  I'd like to  get it.  Then they are often eaten.  We can have a change of diet, you  see.\"    \"We'd better follow him,\" said Tom to Ned.  \"We'll have to let the  turkeys go for a while.  He may get into trouble.  Come on.\"    Off they started through the jungle, trailing after the impetuous  professor who was intent on capturing the iguana.  The giant lizard's  progress"]]]
