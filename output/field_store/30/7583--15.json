ASPENS    A sweet high treble threads its silvery song,  Voice of the restless aspen, fine and thin  It trills its pure soprano, light and long--  Like the vibretto of a mandolin.    FINALE    The cedar trees have sung their vesper hymn,  And now the music sleeps--  Its benediction falling where the dim  Dusk of the forest creeps.  Mute grows the great concerto--and the light  Of day is darkening, Good-night, Good-night.  But through the night time I shall hear within  The murmur of these trees,  The calling of your distant violin  Sobbing across the seas,  And waking wind, and star-reflected light  Shall voice my answering. Good-night, Good-night.        THE TRAIL TO LILLOOET      Sob of fall, and song of forest, come you here on haunting quest,  Calling through the seas and silence, from God's country of the west.  Where the mountain pass is narrow, and the torrent white and strong,  Down its rocky-throated canyon, sings its golden-throated song.    You are singing there together through the God-begotten nights,  And the leaning stars are listening above the distant heights  That lift like points of opal in the crescent coronet  About whose golden setting sweeps the trail to Lillooet.    Trail that winds and trail that wanders, like a cobweb hanging high,  Just a hazy thread outlining mid-way of the stream and sky,  Where the Fraser River canyon yawns its pathway to the sea,  But half the world has shouldered up between its song and me.    Here, the placid English August, and the sea-encircled miles,  There--God's copper-coloured sunshine beating through the lonely aisles  Where the waterfalls and forest voice for ever their duet,  And call across the canyon on the trail to Lillooet.        CANADA      (ACROSTIC)    Crown of her, young Vancouver; crest of her, old Quebec;  Atlantic and far Pacific sweeping her, keel to deck.  North of her, ice and arctics; southward a rival's stealth;  Aloft, her Empire's pennant; below, her nation's wealth.  Daughter of men and markets, bearing within her hold,  Appraised at highest value, cargoes of grain and gold.        THE LIFTING OF THE MIST      All the long day the vapours played    At blindfold in the city streets,  Their elfin fingers caught and stayed    The sunbeams, as they wound their sheets  Into a filmy barricade    'Twixt earth and where the sunlight beats.    A vagrant band of mischiefs these,    With wings of grey and cobweb gown;  They live along the edge of seas,    And creeping out on foot of down,  They chase and frolic, frisk and tease    At blind-man's buff with all the town.    And when at eventide the sun    Breaks with a glory through their grey,  The vapour-fairies, one by one,  Outspread their wings and float away  In clouds of colouring, that run    Wine-like along the rim of day.    Athwart the beauty and the breast    Of purpling airs they twirl and twist,  Then float away to some far rest,    Leaving the skies all colour-kiss't--  A glorious and a golden West    That greets the Lifting of the Mist.        THE HOMING BEE      You are belted with gold, little brother of mine,      Yellow gold, like the sun  That spills in the west, as a chalice of wine      When feasting is done.    You are gossamer-winged, little brother of mine,      Tissue winged, like the mist  That broods where the marshes melt into a line      Of vapour sun-kissed.    You are laden with sweets, little brother of mine,      Flower sweets, like the touch  Of hands we have longed for, of arms that entwine,      Of lips that love much.    You are better than I, little brother of mine,      Than I, human-souled,  For you bring from the blossoms and red summer shine,      For others, your gold.        THE LOST LAGOON      It is dusk on the Lost Lagoon,  And we two dreaming the dusk away,  Beneath the drift of a twilight grey,  Beneath the drowse of an ending day,  And the curve of a golden moon.    It is dark in the Lost Lagoon,  And gone are the depths of haunting blue,  The grouping gulls, and the old canoe,  The singing firs, and the dusk and--you,  And gone is the golden moon.    O! lure of the Lost Lagoon,--  I dream to-night that my paddle blurs  The purple shade where the seaweed stirs,  I hear the call of the singing firs  In the hush of the golden moon.        THE TRAIN DOGS      Out of the night and the north;    Savage of breed and of bone,  Shaggy and swift comes the yelping band,  Freighters of fur from the voiceless land    That sleeps in the Arctic zone.    Laden with skins from the north,    Beaver and bear and raccoon,  Marten and mink from the polar belts,  Otter and ermine and sable pelts--    The spoils of the hunter's moon.    Out of the night and the north,    Sinewy, fearless and fleet,  Urging the pack through the pathless snow,  The Indian driver, calling low,    Follows with moccasined feet.    Ships of the night and the north,    Freighters on prairies and plains,  Carrying cargoes from field and flood  They scent the trail through their wild red blood,    The wolfish blood in their veins.        THE KING'S CONSORT      I    Love, was it yesternoon, or years agone,      You took in yours my hands,  And placed me close beside you on the throne      Of Oriental lands?    The truant hour came back at dawn to-day,      Across the hemispheres,  And bade my sleeping soul retrace its way      These many hundred years.    And all my wild young life returned, and ceased      The years that lie between,  When you were King of Egypt, and The East,      And I was Egypt's queen.    II    I feel again the lengths of silken gossamer enfold  My body and my limbs in robes of emerald and gold.  I feel the heavy sunshine, and the weight of languid heat  That crowned the day you laid the royal jewels at my feet.    You wound my throat with jacinths, green and glist'ning serpent-wise,  My hot, dark throat that pulsed beneath the ardour of your eyes;  And centuries have failed to cool the memory of your hands  That bound about my arms those massive, pliant golden bands.    You wreathed around my wrists long ropes of coral and of jade,  And beaten gold that clung like coils of kisses love-inlaid;  About my naked ankles tawny topaz chains you wound,  With clasps of carven onyx, ruby-rimmed and golden bound.    But not for me the Royal Pearls to bind about my hair,  \"Pearls were too passionless,\" you said, for one like me to wear,  I must have all the splendour, all the jewels warm as wine,  But pearls so pale and cold were meant for other flesh than mine.    But all the blood-warm beauty of the gems you thought my due  Were pallid as a pearl beside the love I gave to you;  O! Love of mine come back across the years that lie between,  When you were King of Egypt--Dear, and I was Egypt's Queen.        WHEN GEORGE WAS KING      Cards, and swords, and a lady's love,  That is a tale worth reading,  An insult veiled, a downcast glove,  And rapiers leap unheeding.      And 'tis O! for the brawl,      The thrust, the fall,  And the foe at your feet a-bleeding.    Tales of revel at wayside inns,  The goblets gaily filling,  Braggarts boasting a thousand sins,  Though none can boast a shilling.      And 'tis O! for the wine,      The frothing stein,  And the clamour of cups a-spilling.    Tales of maidens in rich brocade,  Powder and puff and patches,  Gallants lilting a serenade  Of old-time trolls and catches.      And 'tis O! for the lips      And the finger tips,  And the kiss that the boldest snatches.    Tales of buckle and big rosette,  The slender shoe adorning,  Of curtseying through the minuet  With laughter, love, or scorning.      And 'tis O! for the shout      Of the roustabout,  As he hies him home in the morning.    Cards and swords, and a lady's love,  Give to the tale God-speeding,  War and wassail, and perfumed glove,  And all that's rare in reading.      And 'tis O! for the ways      Of the olden days,  And a life that was worth the leading.        DAY DAWN      All yesterday the thought of you was resting in my soul,  And when sleep wandered o'er the world that very thought she stole  To fill my dreams with splendour such as stars could not eclipse,  And in the morn I wakened with your name upon my lips.    Awakened, my beloved, to the morning of your eyes,  Your splendid eyes, so full of clouds, wherein a shadow tries  To overcome the flame that melts into the world of grey,  As coming suns dissolve the dark that veils the edge of day.    Cool drifts the air at dawn of day, cool lies the sleeping dew,  But all my heart is burning, for it woke from dreams of you;  And O! these longing eyes of mine look out and only see  A dying night, a waking day, and calm on all but me.    So gently creeps the morning through the heavy air,  The dawn grey-garbed and velvet-shod is wandering everywhere  To wake the slumber-laden hours that leave their dreamless rest,  With outspread, laggard wings to court the pillows of the west.    Up from the earth a moisture steals with odours fresh and soft,  A smell of moss and grasses warm with dew, and far aloft  The stars are growing colourless, while drooping in the west,  A late, wan moon is paling in a sky of amethyst.    The passing of the shadows, as they waft their pinions near,  Has stirred a tender wind within the night-hushed atmosphere,  That in its homeless wanderings sobs in an undertone  An echo to my heart that sobbing calls for you alone.    The night is gone, beloved, and another day set free,  Another day of hunger for the one I may not see.  What care I for the perfect dawn? the blue and empty skies?  The night is always mine without the morning of your eyes.        THE ARCHERS      I    Stripped to the waist, his copper-coloured skin  Red from the smouldering heat of hate within,  Lean as a wolf in winter, fierce of mood--  As all wild things that hunt for foes, or food--  War paint adorning breast "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#14)"],[1,"earth, and unto man's earthly affairs, may with propriety be  regulated by earthly authority, but that in the performance of  any ordinance, rite, or ceremony, claimed to be of effect beyond,  the grave, a power greater than that of man is requisite or the  performance is void.  Therefore, membership in the Church, which,  if of any value and significance at all, is of more than temporal  meaning, must be governed by laws which are prescribed by the  powers of heaven.  \"Mormonism\" recognizes Jesus Christ as the  head of the Church, as the literal Savior and Redeemer of  mankind, as the King of kings and Lord of lords, as the One whose  right it is to reign on earth, who shall yet subdue all worldly  kingdoms under his feet, who shall present the earth in its final  state of redemption to the Father.  It is his right to prescribe  the conditions under which mankind may be made partakers of his  bounty and of the privileges of the victory won by him over death  and the grave.    The Church claims that faith in God is essential to intelligent  service of him; and that faith, trust, confidence in God as the  Father of mankind, as the Supreme Being to whom all shall render  account of their deeds and misdeeds, must lead to a desire to  serve him and thus produce repentance.  Faith in God and genuine  repentance of sin, of necessity, therefore constitute the  fundamental principles of the gospel.  It is reasonable to expect  that after man has developed faith in God, and has repented of  his sins, he will be eager to find a means of demonstrating his  sincerity; and this means is found in the requirement concerning  baptism as essential to entrance into the Church, and as a means  whereby remission of sins may be obtained.  As to the mode of  baptism, the Church affirms that immersion alone is the one  method sanctioned by scripture, and that this mode has been  expressly prescribed by revelation in the present dispensation.    Water baptism, then, becomes a basic principle and the first  essential ordinance of the gospel.  It is to be administered by  one having authority; and that authority rests in the Priesthood  given of God.  Following baptism by water, comes the ordinance of  the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the authorized imposition of  hands, which constitutes the true baptism of the Spirit.  These  requirements, designated specifically the \"first principles and  ordinances of the gospel,\" \"Mormonism\" claims to be absolutely  essential to membership in the Church of Christ, and this without  modification or qualification as to the time at which the  individual lived in mortality.    Then with propriety it may be asked:--What shall become of those  who lived and died while the Priesthood was not operative upon  the earth?--those who have worked out their mortal probation  during the ages of the great apostasy?  Furthermore, what shall  be the destiny of those who, though living in a time of spiritual  light, perhaps had not the opportunity of learning and obeying  the gospel requirements? Here again the inherent justice of  \"Mormon\" philosophy shows itself in the doctrine of salvation for  the dead. No distinction is made between the living and the dead  in the solemn declaration of the Savior to Nicodemus, which  appears to have been given the widest possible application,--that  except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter  into the Kingdom of God.  (John 3:1-5.)    \"Mormonism\" proclaims something more than a heaven and a hell, to  one or the other of which all spirits of men shall be assigned,  perhaps on the basis of a very narrow margin of merit or demerit.  As it affirms the existence of an infinite range of graded  intelligences, so it claims the widest and fullest gradation of  conditions of future existence.  It holds that the honest,  though, perchance, mistaken soul who lived or tried to live  according to the light he had received, shall be counted among  the honorable of the earth, and shall find opportunity, if not  here then in the hereafter, for compliance with the requirements  essential for salvation.  It teaches that repentance with all its  attendant blessings shall be possible beyond the grave; but that  inasmuch as the change we call death does not transform the  character of the soul, repentance there will be difficult for him  who has ruthlessly and willfully rejected the manifold  opportunities afforded him for repentance here.  It asserts that  even the heathen devotee who may have bowed down to stocks and  stones, if in so doing he was obeying the highest law of worship  which to his benighted soul had come, shall have part in the  first resurrection, and shall be afforded the opportunity, which  on earth he had not found, of doing that which is required of  God's children for salvation.  And for all the dead who have been  without the privileges, perhaps indeed without the knowledge, of  compliance with Christ's law, there shall be given opportunity in  the hereafter.    Nevertheless, this life of ours is no trifle, no insignificant  incident in the soul's eternal course, having but small and  temporal importance, the omissions of which can be rectified with  ease by the individual beyond the veil.  If compliance with the  divine law as exemplified by the requirements of faith,  repentance, baptism, and the bestowal of the right to the  ministrations of the Holy Ghost, are essential to the salvation  of those few who just now are counted among the living, such is  not less necessary for those who once were living but now are  dead.  Who are the living of today but those who shortly shall be  added to the uncounted dead?  Who are the dead but those who at  some time have lived in mortality?    Christ has been ordained to be judge of both quick and dead; he  is Lord of living and dead as man uses these terms, for all live  unto him.  How then shall the dead receive the blessings and  ordinances denied to them or by them neglected while in the  flesh?  \"Mormonism\" answers: By the vicarious work of the living  in their behalf!  It was this great and privileged labor to which  the prophet Malachi referred in his solemn declaration, that  before the great and dreadful day of the Lord, Elijah should be  sent with the commission to turn the hearts of the fathers to the  children and the hearts of the children to the fathers.  Elijah's  visitation to earth has been realized.  On the 3rd of April, in  the year 1836, there appeared unto Joseph Smith and Oliver  Cowdery, in the temple erected by the.  Latter-day Saints at  Kirtland, Ohio, Elijah the prophet, who announced that the time  spoken of by Malachi had fully come; then and there he bestowed  the authority, for this dispensation, to inaugurate and carry on  this labor in behalf of the departed.    As to the fidelity with which the Latter-day Saints have sought  to discharge the duties thus divinely required at their hands,  let the temples erected in poverty as in relative prosperity--by  the blood and tears of the people--testify.  Two of these great  edifices were constructed by the Latter-day Saints in the days of  their tribulation, in times of their direst persecution,--one at  Kirtland, Ohio, the other at Nauvoo, Illinois.  The first is  still standing, though no longer possessed by the people who  built it; and no longer employed for the furtherance of the  purposes of its erection; the second fell a prey to flames  enkindled by mobocratic hate.  Four others have been constructed  in the vales of Utah, and are today in service, dedicated to the  blessing of the living, and particularly to the vicarious labor  of the living in behalf of the dead.  In them the ordinances of  baptism, and the laying on of hands for the bestowal of the Holy  Ghost, are performed upon the living representatives of the  dead.[6]    [Footnote 6: For a detailed treatment of Temples and Temple labor  among the Latter-day Saints, including a study of the doctrine of  vicarious labor for the dead, see \"The House of the Lord, a Study  of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern,\" including forty-six  plates illustrative of modern Temples; by James E. Talmage.  Published by the Church: Salt Lake City, Utah; 336 pp.]    But this labor for the dead is two-fold; it comprises the proper  performance of the required ordinances on earth, and the  preaching of the gospel to the departed.  Shall we suppose that  all of God's good gifts to his children are restricted to the  narrow limits of mortal existence?  We are told of the  inauguration of this great missionary labor in the spirit world,  as effected by the Christ himself.  After his resurrection, and  immediately following the period during which his body had lain  in the tomb guarded by the soldiery, he declared to the sorrowing  Magdalene that he had not at that time ascended to his Father;  and, in the light of his dying promise to the penitent malefactor  who suffered on a cross by his side, we learn that he had been in  paradise.  Peter also tells us of his labors--that he was  preaching to the spirits in prison, to those who had been  disobedient in the days of Noah when the long-suffering of God  waited while the ark was preparing.  If it was deemed necessary  or just that the gospel be carried to spirits that were  disobedient or neglectful in the days of Noah, are we justified  in concluding that others who have rejected or neglected the word  of God shall be left in a state of perpetual condemnation?    \"Mormonism\" claims that not only shall the gospel be carried to  the living, and be preached to every creature, but that the great  missionary labor, the burden of which has been placed on the  Church, must of necessity be extended to the realm of the dead.  It declares unequivocally that without compliance with the  requirements established by Jesus Christ, no soul can be saved  from the fate of the condemned; but that opportunity shall be  given to every one in the season of"]]]
