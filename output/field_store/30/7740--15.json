In itself a matter of small importance, a misunderstanding of this sort  was bound to grow and cause further ill-feeling. Fifty-two years after  the revolt under the Emperor Titus the Jews once more rebelled. This  time the Romans decided to be thorough in their work of destruction.    Jerusalem was destroyed.    The temple was burned down.    A new Roman city, called Aelia Capitolina was erected upon the ruins of  the old city of Solomon.    A heathenish temple devoted to the worship of Jupiter was built upon the  site where the faithful had worshipped Jehovah for almost a  thousand years.    The Jews themselves were expelled from their capital and thousands of  them were driven away from the home of their ancestors.    From that moment on they became wanderers upon the face of the Earth.    But the Holy Laws no longer needed the safe shelter of a royal shrine.    Their influence had long since passed beyond the narrow confines of the  land of Judah. They had become a living symbol of Justice wherever  honorable people tried to live a righteous life.        DAMASCUS--THE CITY OF TRADE    The old cities of Egypt have disappeared from the face of the earth.  Nineveh and Babylon are deserted mounds of dust and brick. The ancient  temple of Jerusalem lies buried beneath the blackened ruins of its  own glory.    One city alone has survived the ages.    It is called Damascus.    Within its four great gates and its strong walls a busy people has  followed its daily occupations for five thousand consecutive years and  the \"Street called Straight\" which is the city's main artery of  commerce, has seen the coming and going of one hundred and fifty  generations.    Humbly Damascus began its career as a fortified frontier town of the  Amorites, those famous desert folk who had given birth to the great King  Hammurapi. When the Amorites moved further eastward into the valley of  Mesopotamia to found the Kingdom of Babylon, Damascus had been continued  as a trading post with the wild Hittites who inhabited the mountains of  Asia Minor.    In due course of time the earliest inhabitants had been absorbed by  another Semitic tribe, called the Aramaeans. The city itself however had  not changed its character. It remained throughout these many changes an  important center of commerce.    It was situated upon the main road from Egypt to Mesopotamia and it was  within a week's distance from the harbors on the Mediterranean. It  produced no great generals and statesmen and no famous Kings. It did not  conquer a single mile of neighboring territory. It traded with all the  world and offered a safe home to the merchant and to the artisan.  Incidentally it bestowed its language upon the greater part of  western Asia.    Commerce has always demanded quick and practical ways of communication  between different nations. The elaborate system of nail-writing of the  ancient Sumerians was too involved for the Aramaean business man. He  invented a new alphabet which could be written much faster than the old  wedge-shaped figures of Babylon.    The spoken language of the Aramaeans followed their business  correspondence.    Aramaean became the English of the ancient world. In most parts of  Mesopotamia it was understood as readily as the native tongue. In some  countries it actually took the place of the old tribal dialect.    And when Christ preached to the multitudes, he did not use the ancient  Jewish speech in which Moses had explained the Laws unto his fellow  wanderers.    He spoke in Aramaean, the language of the merchant, which had become the  language of the simple people of the old Mediterranean world.        THE PHOENICIANS WHO SAILED BEYOND THE HORIZON    A pioneer is a brave fellow, with the courage of his own curiosity.    Perhaps he lives at the foot of a high mountain.    So do thousands of other people. They are quite contented to leave the  mountain alone.    But the pioneer feels unhappy. He wants to know what mysteries this  mountain hides from his eyes. Is there another mountain behind it, or a  plain? Does it suddenly arise with its steep cliffs from the dark waves  of the ocean or does it overlook a desert?    One fine day the true pioneer leaves his family and the safe comfort of  his home to go and find out. Perhaps he will come back and tell his  experience to his indifferent relatives. Or he will be killed by falling  stones or a treacherous blizzard. In that case he does not return at all  and the good neighbors shake their heads and say, \"He got what he  deserved. Why did he not stay at home like the rest of us?\"    [Illustration: THE DISTANT HORIZON]    But the world needs such men and after they have been dead for many  years and others have reaped the benefits of their discoveries, they  always receive a statue with a fitting inscription.    More terrifying than the highest mountain is the thin line of the  distant horizon. It seems to be the end of the world itself. Heaven have  mercy upon those who pass beyond this meeting-place of sky and water,  where all is black despair and death.    And for centuries and centuries after man had built his first clumsy  boats, he remained within the pleasant sight of one familiar shore and  kept away from the horizon.    Then came the Phoenicians who knew no such fears. They passed beyond the  sight of land. Suddenly the forbidding ocean was turned into a peaceful  highway of commerce and the dangerous menace of the horizon became  a myth.    These Phoenician navigators were Semites. Their ancestors had lived in  the desert of Arabia together with the Babylonians, the Jews and all the  others. But when the Jews occupied Palestine, the cities of the  Phoenicians were already old with the age of many centuries.    There were two Phoenician centers of trade.    One was called Tyre and the other was called Sidon. They were built upon  high cliffs and rumor had it that no enemy could take them. Far and wide  their ships sailed to gather the products of the Mediterranean for the  benefit of the people of Mesopotamia.    At first the sailors only visited the distant shores of France and Spain  to barter with the natives and hastened home with their grain and metal.  Later they had built fortified trading posts along the coasts of Spain  and Italy and Greece and the far-off Scilly Islands where the valuable  tin was found.    [Illustration: THE PHOENICIANS.]    To the uncivilized savages of Europe, such a trading post appeared as a  dream of beauty and luxury. They asked to be allowed to live close to  its walls, to see the wonderful sights when the boats of many sails  entered the harbor, carrying the much-desired merchandise of the unknown  east. Gradually they left their huts to build themselves small wooden  houses around the Phoenician fortresses. In this way many a trading post  had grown into a market place for all the people of the entire  neighborhood.    Today such big cities as Marseilles and Cadiz are proud of their  Phoenician origin, but their ancient mothers, Tyre and Sidon, have been  dead and forgotten for over two thousand years and of the Phoenicians  themselves, none have survived.    This is a sad fate but it was fully deserved.    The Phoenicians had grown rich without great effort, but they had not  known how to use their wealth wisely. They had never cared for books or  learning. They had only cared for money.    They had bought and sold slaves all over the world. They had forced the  foreign immigrants to work in their factories. They cheated their  neighbors whenever they had a chance and they had made themselves  detested by all the other people of the Mediterranean.    They were brave and energetic navigators, but they showed themselves  cowards whenever they were obliged to choose between honorable dealing  and an immediate profit, obtained through fraudulent and shrewd trading.    As long as they had been the only sailors in the world who could handle  large ships, all other nations had been in need of their services. As  soon as the others too had learned how to handle a rudder and a set of  sails, they at once got rid of the tricky Phoenician merchant.    From that moment on, Tyre and Sidon had lost their old hold upon the  commercial world of Asia. They had never encouraged art or science. They  had known how to explore the seven seas and turn their ventures into  profitable investments. No state, however, can be safely built upon  material possessions alone.    The land of Phoenicia had always been a counting-house without a soul.    It perished because it had honored a well-filled treasure chest as the  highest ideal of civic pride.        THE ALPHABET FOLLOWS THE TRADE    I have told you how the Egyptians preserved speech by means of little  figures. I have described the wedge-shaped signs which served the people  of Mesopotamia as a handy means of transacting business at home  and abroad.    But how about our own alphabet? From whence came those compact little  letters which follow us throughout our life, from the date on our birth  certificate to the last word of our funeral notice? Are they Egyptian or  Babylonian or Aramaic or are they something entirely different? They are  a little bit of everything, as I shall now tell you.    Our modern alphabet is not a very satisfactory instrument for the  purpose of reproducing our speech. Some day a genius will invent a new  system of writing which shall give each one of our sounds a little  picture of its own. But with all its many imperfections the letters of  our modern alphabet perform their daily task quite nicely and fully as  well as their very accurate and precise cousins, the numerals, who  wandered into Europe from distant India, almost ten centuries after the  first invasion of the alphabet. The earliest history of these letters,  however, is a deep mystery and it will take many years of painstaking  investigation before we can solve it.
