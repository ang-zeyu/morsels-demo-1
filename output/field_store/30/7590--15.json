Tomorrow is Labor Day.  Labor Day in this country has never been a  class holiday.  It has always been a national holiday.  It has never  had more significance as a national holiday than it has now.  In  other countries the relationship of employer and employee has been  more or less been accepted as a class relationship not readily to  be broken through.  In this country we insist, as an essential of  the American way of life, that the employer-employee relationship  should be one between free men and equals.  We refuse to regard  those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to  those who live from their property.  We insist that labor is  entitled to as much respect as property.  But our workers with hand  and brain deserve more than respect for their labor.  They deserve  practical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a  return adequate to support them at a decent and constantly rising  standard of living, and to accumulate a margin of security against  the inevitable vicissitudes of life.    The average man must have that twofold opportunity if we are to  avoid the growth of a class-conscious society in this country.    There are those who fail to read both the signs of the times and  American history.  They would try to refuse the worker any effective  power to bargain collectively, to earn a decent livelihood and to  acquire security.  It is those short-sighted ones, not labor, who  threaten this country with that class dissension which in other  countries has led to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and  hatred as the dominant emotions in human life.    All American workers, brain workers and manual workers alike, and  all the rest of us whose well-being depends on theirs, know that  our needs are one in building an orderly economic democracy in  which all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind  of faulty economic direction which brought us to the brink of  common ruin seven years ago.    There is no cleavage between white collar workers and manual  workers, between artists and artisans, musicians and mechanics,  lawyers and accountants and architects and miners.    Tomorrow, Labor Day, belongs to all of us.  Tomorrow, Labor Day,  symbolizes the hope of all Americans.  Anyone who calls it a class  holiday challenges the whole concept of American democracy.    The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom--a freedom  which without economic freedom is meaningless indeed.  Labor Day  symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the  average man which will give his political freedom reality.        March 9, 1937.      Last Thursday I described in detail certain economic problems which  everyone admits now face the nation.  For the many messages which  have come to me after that speech, and which it is physically  impossible to answer individually, I take this means of saying  \"thank you.\"    Tonight, sitting at my desk in the White House, I make my first  radio report to the people in my second term of office.    I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made  my first radio report to you.  We were then in the midst of the  great banking crisis.    Soon after, with the authority of the Congress, we asked the nation  to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for dollar, to  the government of the United States.    Today's recovery proves how right that policy was.    But when, almost two years later, it came before the Supreme Court  its constitutionality was upheld only by a five-to-four vote.  The  change of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great  Nation back into hopeless chaos.  In effect, four Justices ruled  that the right under a private contract to exact a pound of flesh  was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to  establish an enduring Nation.    In 1933 you and I knew that we must never let our economic system  get completely out of joint again--that we could not afford to take  the risk of another great depression.    We also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of  those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent and  to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that  system out of joint.    We then began a program of remedying those abuses and  inequalities--to give balance and stability to our economic  system--to make it bomb-proof against the causes of 1929.    Today we are only part-way through that program--and recovery is  speeding up to a point where the dangers of 1929 are again becoming  possible, not this week or month perhaps, but within a year or two.    National laws are needed to complete that program.  Individual or  local or state effort alone cannot protect us in 1937 any better  than ten years ago.    It will take time--and plenty of time--to work out our remedies  administratively even after legislation is passed.  To complete our  program of protection in time, therefore, we cannot delay one  moment in making certain that our national government has power to  carry through.    Four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.  It was  almost too late.    If we learned anything from the depression we will not allow  ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and  debate, always postponing the day of decision.    The American people have learned from the depression.  For in the  last three national elections an overwhelming majority of them  voted a mandate that the Congress and the President begin the task  of providing that protection--not after long years of debate, but  now.    The courts, however, have cast doubts on the ability of the elected  Congress to protect us against catastrophe by meeting squarely our  modern social and economic conditions.    We are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.  It is a quiet crisis.  There are no lines of depositors outside  closed banks.  But to the far-sighted it is far-reaching in its  possibilities of injury to America.    I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present  action in this crisis--the need to meet the unanswered challenge of  one-third of a Nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, ill-housed.    Last Thursday I described the American form of government as a  three horse team provided by the Constitution to the American  people so that their field might be plowed.  The three horses are,  of course, the three branches of government--the Congress, the  Executive and the courts.  Two of the horses are pulling in unison  today; the third is not.  Those who have intimated that the  President of the United States is trying to drive that team,  overlook the simple fact that the President, as Chief Executive, is  himself one of the three horses.    It is the American people themselves who are in the driver's seat.    It is the American people themselves who want the furrow plowed.    It is the American people themselves who expect the third horse to  pull in unison with the other two.    I hope that you have re-read the Constitution of the United States  in these past few weeks.  Like the Bible, it ought to be read again  and again.    It is an easy document to understand when you remember that it was  called into being because the Articles of Confederation under which  the original thirteen States tried to operate after the Revolution  showed the need of a national government with power enough to  handle national problems.  In its Preamble, the Constitution states  that it was intended to form a more perfect Union and promote the  general welfare; and the powers given to the Congress to carry out  those purposes can be best described by saying that they were all  the powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a  national character and which could not be met by merely local  action.    But the framers went further.  Having in mind that in succeeding  generations many other problems then undreamed of would become  national problems, they gave to the Congress the ample broad powers  \"to levy taxes. . . and provide for the common defense and general  welfare of the United States.\"    That, my friends, is what I honestly believe to have been the clear  and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal  constitution to create a national government with national power,  intended as they said, \"to form a more perfect union. . . for  ourselves and our posterity.\"    For nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the Congress  and the Court.  Then Congress passed a statute which, in 1803, the  Court said violated an express provision of the Constitution.  The  Court claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional and did so  declare it.  But a little later the Court itself admitted that it  was an extraordinary power to exercise and through Mr. Justice  Washington laid down this limitation upon it:  \"It is but a decent  respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the  legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor  of its validity until its violation of the Constitution is proved  beyond all reasonable doubt.\"    But since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic  progress through legislation, the Court has more and more often and  more and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the  Congress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this  original limitation.    In the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the  benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside.  The Court has  been acting not as a judicial body, but as a policy-making body.    When the Congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to  improve the conditions of labor, to safeguard business against  unfair competition, to protect our national resources, and in many  other ways,"]]]
