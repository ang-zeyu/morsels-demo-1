By this manoeuvre, Ariovistus cut  off Caesar's communication with Sequania and the AEduan country, but he  left open the communications with the country of the Leuci and the  Lingones.[223] (_See the Map of Gaul, 2._) The two armies thus encamped  at a short distance from each other. During the five following days,  Caesar drew out his troops each day, and formed them in order of battle  at the head of his camp (_pro castris suas copias produxit_), but was  not able to provoke the Germans to fight; all hostility was limited to  cavalry skirmishes, in which the latter were much practised. To 6,000  horsemen was joined an equal number of picked men on foot, among whom  each horseman had chosen one to watch over him in combat. According to  circumstances, the horsemen fell back upon the footmen, or the latter  advanced to their assistance. Such was their agility, that they kept up  with the horses, running and holding by the mane.[224]    Caesar, seeing that Ariovistus persisted in shutting himself up in his  camp and intercepting his communications, sought to re-establish them,  chose an advantageous position about 600 paces (900 metres) beyond that  occupied by the Germans, and led thither his army drawn up in three  lines. He kept the first and second under arms, and employed the third  on the retrenchments. The spot on which he established himself is  perhaps the eminence situated on the Little Doller, to the north of  Schweighausen. Ariovistus sent thither about 16,000 of his light troops  and all his cavalry, to intimidate the Romans and impede the works.  Nevertheless, the third line continued them, and the two others repelled  the attack. The camp once fortified, Caesar left in it two legions and a  part of the auxiliaries, and took back the four others to the principal  camp. The two Roman camps were 3,600 metres distant from each other.    Hitherto Caesar had been satisfied with drawing out his troops and  backing them upon his retrenchments; the next day, persisting in his  tactics (_instituto suo_) of trying to provoke Ariovistus to fight, he  drew them up at a certain distance in advance of the principal camp, and  placed them in order of battle (_paulum a majoribus castris progressus,  aciem instruxit_). In spite of this advanced position (_ne tum  quidem_), Ariovistus persisted in not coming out. The Roman army  re-entered the camp towards midday, and a part of the German troops  immediately attacked the small camp. Both armies fought resolutely till  evening, and there were many wounded on both sides. Astonished at seeing  that, in spite of this engagement, Ariovistus still avoided a general  battle, Caesar interrogated the prisoners, and learnt that the matrons  charged with consulting destiny had declared that the Germans could not  be conquerors if they fought before the new moon.[225]      [Sidenote: Battle against the Germans.]    VIII. Next day, leaving a sufficient guard in the two camps, Caesar  placed all his auxiliaries in view of the enemy, in advance of the  smaller camp; the number of the legionaries being less than that of the  Germans, he sought to conceal his inferiority from the enemy by  displaying other troops. While the Germans took these auxiliaries for  the two legions which occupied the lesser camp, the latter left it by  the Decuman gate, and, unperceived, went to rejoin the other four. Then  Caesar drew up his six legions in three lines, and, marching forward, he  led them up to the enemy's camp (_usque ad castra hostium accessit_).  This offensive movement allowed the Germans no longer the choice of  avoiding battle: they quitted their camp, descended into the plain,[226]  drew up in line, by order of nations, at equal intervals--Harudes,  Marcomanni, Suevi, Triboces, Vangiones, Nemetes, and Sedusii; and, to  deprive themselves of all possibility of flight, inclosed themselves on  the sides and in the rear by a circuit of carriages and wagons, on which  they placed their women: dishevelled and in tears, these implored the  warriors, as they marched to the battle, not to deliver them in slavery  to the Romans. In this position, the Roman army faced the east, and the  German army the west, and their lines extended over a space now partly  covered by the forest of Nonnenbruch.[227]    Caesar, still more to animate his soldiers, determined to give them  witnesses worthy of their courage, and placed at the head of each legion  either one of his lieutenants or his quaestor.[228] He led the attack in  person, with his right wing, on the side where the Germans seemed  weakest. The signal given, the legions dash forward; the enemy, on his  side, rushes to the encounter. On both sides the impetuosity is so great  that the Romans, not having time to use the _pilum_, throw it away, and  fight hand to hand with the sword. But the Germans, according to their  custom, to resist an attack of this kind, form rapidly in phalanxes of  three or four hundred men,[229] and cover their bare heads with their  bucklers. They are pressed so close together, that even when dead they  still remain standing.[230] Such was the ardour of the legionaries, that  many rushed upon these sort of tortoises, tearing away the bucklers, and  striking the enemies from above.[231] The short and sharp-pointed swords  of the Romans had the advantage over the long swords of the  Germans.[232] Nevertheless, according to Appian, the legions owed their  victory chiefly to the superiority of their tactics and the steadiness  with which they kept their ranks.[233] Ariovistus's left did not resist  long; but while it was driven back and put to flight, the right, forming  in deep masses, pressed the Romans hard. Young P. Crassus, commander of  the cavalry placed at a distance from the thick of the battle, and  better placed to judge of its incidents, perceived this, sent the third  line to the succour of the wavering legions, and restored the combat.  Soon Ariovistus's right was obliged to give way in its turn; the rout  then became general, and the Germans desisted from flight only when they  reached the Rhine, fifty miles from the field of battle.[234] They  descended, no doubt, the valley of the Ill as far as Rhinau, thus  retracing a part of the road by which they had come. (_See Plate 4._)  Caesar sent his cavalry after them; all who were overtaken were cut to  pieces; the rest attempted to swim across the river, or sought safety in  boats. Among the latter was Ariovistus, who threw himself into a  boat[235] he found attached to the bank. According to Plutarch and  Appian,[236] 80,000 men perished in the combat and during the pursuit.  Two of the wives of the German king experienced the same fate; one was a  Sueve, the other a Norician. Of his two daughters, one was killed and  the other taken prisoner. Caesar says that, as he himself pursued the  enemy with his cavalry, he experienced a pleasure equal to that given by  victory when he recovered, first Procillus, loaded with a triple chain,  and who had thrice seen the barbarians draw lots whether he should be  burnt alive or not, and, subsequently, M. Mettius, both of whom, as we  have seen, had been sent by him as messengers to Ariovistus.    The report of this glorious exploit having spread beyond the Rhine, the  Suevi, who had come to its banks, returned home. The Ubii, who dwelt  near the river, pursued their terrified bands, and slew a considerable  number of the fugitives.    Caesar, having concluded two great wars in one single campaign, placed  his army in winter quarters among the Sequani rather sooner than the  season required--at the beginning of September--and left them under the  command of Labienus. He then left, and went to hold the assemblies in  Cisalpine Gaul.[237]      [Sidenote: Observations.]    IX. There are several things worthy of remark in this campaign:--    1. The resolution taken by Caesar to gain possession of Besancon, and  thus to anticipate Ariovistus. We see the importance which he attaches  to that military position as a point of support and of supply.    2. The facility with which a whole legion transforms itself into  cavalry.    3. The judicious use which Caesar makes of his light troops (_alarii_),  by assembling them in mass, so that the enemy should believe in a  greater number of legions.    4. Lastly, this singular circumstance, that the third line, which serves  as reserve and decides the fate of the battle, receives from young P.  Crassus, and not from the general-in-chief, the order to attack.    The dates of the principal events of this year may be indicated in the  following manner:--    Rendezvous of the Helvetii on the  banks of the Rhone (the day of the  equinox)                                 March 24.    Caesar refuses them a passage through  the province                              April 8.    Arrival at the confluence of the Rhone  and the Saone of the legions from  Italy and Illyria                          June 7.    Defeat of the Tigurini on the Saone       June 10.    Passage of the Saone by Caesar             June 12.    About fifteen days' march (_De Bello  Gallico_, I. 15)          From June 13 to June 27.    Manoeuvre of Labienus to surprise the  Helvetii                                  June 28.    Battle of Bibracte                        June 29.    Caesar remains three days interring the  dead; marches on the fourth; employs  six days in his march from  the field of battle to the country of  the Lingones, and there overtakes  the Helvetii in their retreat,                             From June 30 to July 8.    Negotiations with Ariovistus (a month),                            From July 8 to August 8.    Departure of Caesar (from Tonnerre,  to meet Ariovistus)                     August 10."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#14)"],[1,"bour. Will the picture I have learned to love  so well ever fade? The countless masts rising to the sky, the water  dashing over the distant breakwater, the clock at the Gare Maritime,  now visible, now obscured by smoke from the packet-boat's funnel.    The incoming destroyers, the sister hospital ships lying abreast,  the distant windmill on the hill, round which many corrugated iron  buildings are springing up (bakeries, they say), the weather-beaten  tars, the women, their backs bent with the weight of their sacks of  mussels and cockles, tramping along barefooted or in sabots, the  ceaseless stream of ambulances.      _February 8th._ Laden with parting gifts and consoled by parting  regrets (strangest among them those of our padre, who will miss having  someone to darn his socks!), we found ourselves at our new domain--the  American girl and I.    Certainly the circumstances of our arrival were far from favourable,  for my colleague fell very ill the day we arrived, and after a night  spent on the floor of her ten-by-eight-feet-long room (oh, those  boards!--my bones still ache, my head swims in memory of them), we  installed her in a military hospital, and set to work to \"carry on.\"    Two other workers have arrived from England; neither of them having  done hard manual labour before, they are apt to find this somewhat  strenuous, though to our more veteran hands it is child's play.  Footsoreness, too, that bane of all amateur workers, is their portion.    There are times when one wonders if all new things are horrid!    This morning, at Mattins in the little tin church, for instance, when  the convalescent soldier organist, with the angelic face and absolute  lack of any musical instinct, crashed out his last discordant notes,  when the congregation, consisting of three nurses, the old, old man who  took round the plate, and two maiden ladies who acted as choir, trooped  into the sunshine, I could not but cast a longing thought at St.  John's, with its dim religious glow and mellow organ and congregation  of muddy soldiers.      _February 12th._ Besides getting the place in order, we are busily  employed in thinking out new dishes for the men. To the ordinary store  of cakes and drinks we have already added custard, stewed fruits, and  bread puddings.    In spare moments I catalogue the library, and have evolved a good  system by which the men fill in the register themselves on taking out a  book, thus dispensing with a librarian. The library book is like this:     Rank  Name        Number  Regt.    No. of   Name of     Date                                      Book     Book        taken     Pte.  J. Smith    30496   R.F.        4    \"She\"        Feb. 1   Cpl.  J. Philips   5328   R.A.M.C.  299    \"Last Days   Feb. 10                                              of Pompeii\"      _February 16th._ Yesterday, a train being derailed close by here on  its way up to the front, and the men left stranded, we took them up a  supply of cigarettes and chocolates that good friends at home had sent  out.    The canteen is growing like wildfire, and we are heart and soul in  our work, which we estimate by the material return in the till each  evening. We have trebled the receipts in two weeks, which shows how the  men are flocking to it.      _February 18th._ _The day_--the great day of the German blockade. We  are wondering how far the enemy will really carry out his scheme.  Certainly no mail boat has come in to-day, and we are without letters  or newspapers. The suspension of communication with England is nothing  new, but we are speculating if this time it will be a matter of weeks  instead of days.    Being _hors de combat_ with a sore throat--the toll exacted apparently  by this germ-filled place from every worker who comes to stay--I have  leisure to note our surroundings. The walls of the large, airy room,  which though devoid of all save the necessities of life is luxury  embodied by reason of its cleanliness, are bare except for a few unpaid  bills held together by a file, a few hastily scrawled quotations from  favourite authors to remind us that we once had time to indulge in  beautiful pictures, to roam into the realms of beautiful books.    By the window, acting as a couch, are two large wooden cases in which  gramophones for the men had been sent out, and which prove a great  attraction to the friendly little mice who come out and hold long  confabulations, not only under cover of night, but frequently, when  things are quiet, by day. They are welcome enough to the wooden boxes,  but when they take to running over our beds, our clothing as it lies  on the chairs, and finally even over our _faces_, they can hardly  expect to be well received!    The view from the window is superb. Before us, in front of the  little grey church, the river runs down to the sea, now gently, now  turbulently. To the right a peep of the ocean. To the left the bridge,  through the arches of which is a glimpse of landscape as peaceful as  any Tuscan village, and over which the trains pass intermittently up to  the front by day and by night. They rush past with a whistle that is  more of a shriek and a groan, as if they themselves realised the value  of their burden--the guns, the ammunition wagons, the trainloads of men  in khaki or in blue clustered along the edge of the overcrowded trucks  designed to carry \"eighteen horses or thirty-six men.\"    In contrast with the rushing up-trains the loaded ambulances crawl  creakingly down at a snail's pace.    God! That such things should be! If the heart of the world were big  enough, surely it would break at so much misery, so much destruction.  For what have all previous generations laboured, legislating, studying  to salve human ills? For this! Wanton destruction, rapine, murder.      _February 21st._ These are exciting times. Last night there was the  sound of guns at sea. An engagement off Dover is recounted, but papers  no longer get through to us. A sudden explosion about five o'clock  the same day, and the subsequent report of a sunken hospital ship,  afterwards said to have been a neutral (Dutch?) liner, leaves us with  but the vaguest idea of what really happened.    Just as the doctor, a kindly little man, who was invalided down some  weeks ago from his field ambulance at B----, had appeared, stethoscope  in hand, all attention was riveted on a funeral that passed by--that  of a nursing sister who has just died of the fatal spotted fever. The  flower-bedecked coffin, the whole available hospital unit marching  slowly with arms reversed, made an impressive sight. One wondered if  she had ever received so much attention in her lifetime as at her  death. The doctor told me that in India, where the intense heat is  sometimes conducive to suicide, the fear of _not_ having a military  funeral often acts as a deterrent.     [Illustration: \"THE BRIDGE, THROUGH THE ARCHES OF WHICH IS A GLIMPSE OF  LANDSCAPE AS PEACEFUL AS ANY TUSCAN VILLAGE\"]    No sooner was the cortege past than a broken aeroplane rolled by on a  heavy trolley, and left us wondering if that was the crash we heard  yesterday.    An air raid on Calais, packet-boat nearly sunk, torpedoes off  Boulogne--it almost seems as if we are going to see the real thing.    Martial law here has become very strict. The roads are guarded so that  one cannot move an inch without showing passports. Lights have to be  out by 9 P.M., and even my diary has to be penned behind a screen of  bedclothes with the aid of a candle stump. Seeing that we only finish  work at 9 P.M., have to get home, eat our supper, and go to bed in  the dark, it is rather tiresome, and we are now engaged in rigging up  light-proof curtains.    On returning to work after my first committee meeting--the very  existence of which proves the method that is creeping into the  erstwhile chaos--I was greeted by the news of our Dardanelles  Expedition which is now occupying all our attention.          CHAPTER VI    March, 1915      _March 5th._ March was inaugurated by an amusing incident. At about  midnight the alarm was given--a Taube or Zeppelin signalled from  Calais--bells rang, guns boomed, the whole of the French population  turned out, and the police raided a nurse's room because a light was  visible--and, after all, nothing happened.    That the Germans still have hopes of getting to Calais is obvious from  their Press comments on the range of their coast guns.    \"The chief point of which lies in the suggestion that from Calais the  harbour defences of Dover can be bombarded over a front of five and a  half miles!\" (See extract from _Daily Mail_.) Their preparations for  billeting a number of troops in Belgium are large: \"At Liege 20,000 men  are expected.\" The order has been given for the Wimereux hospitals to  be cleared.    \"It is our duty to keep the men here and feed the front,\" said one of  the C.O.s to-day. \"And when we are told to clear it means a big move.\"      _March 10th._ In spite of the fact that a great battle is raging at  Neuve Chapelle, where the British have made a great push, the \"all  star\" concert party, sent over by the Y.M.C.A. in London, gave a  performance in the large gaming room of the Casino (once the haunt of  so much frivolity). The worst cases lay in beds in the centre, whilst  the blue-jacketed lesser cases clustered behind, and the sisters  flitted to and fro in their grey dresses and red capes attending to the  more serious.    \"Messieurs, faites vos jeux, le jeu est fait!\" Over and over again the  suave voice of the croupier seemed to ring in my ears--as it had so  often rung in this very room in peace time. \"Faites vos jeux.\" What an  awful thing this new game of War is, only those who have seen can grasp.    \"Le jeu est fait!\"--and here in this gilded hall, that once witnessed  such a different game, we see the results.    Stretchers were brought in all through the performance. As I glanced up  during the cheerful"]]]
