[_He pauses thoughtfully._          And for the downfall        Schemes Alberich!        Now I see        The sense hidden    In the strange, wild words of the Wala:    \"When the gloomy foe of love    Gets a son in his wrath,        The high gods' doom        Shall be at hand!\"        Not long ago        A rumour I heard    That the dwarf had won a woman,    By gold gaining her grace.        A woman bears        Hate's bitter fruit;        The child of spite        Grows in her womb;        This marvel befell        The man who loved not;        But I, the loving wooer,        Have never begotten the free.            [_Rising in bitter wrath._          Accept thou my blessing,        Nibelung son!        I leave to thee        What I loathe with deep loathing:    The hollow pomp of the gods.    Consume it with envious greed!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Alarmed._          O say! tell me        What task is thy child's?    WOTAN [_Bitterly._      Fight, faithful to Fricka;    Wedlock and vows defend!        What she desires        Is also my choice,    For what does my own will profit,    Since it cannot fashion a free one?        For Fricka's slaves        Do battle henceforth!    BRÜNNHILDE          Ah repent,        And take back thy word!        Thou lovest,        And fain, I know,    Wouldst have me shelter the Wälsung.    WOTAN      Siegmund thou shalt vanquish,    And fight so that Hunding prevails.        Ward thyself well        And doughtily do,        Bring all thy boldness        To bear on the field;        A strong sword        Swings Siegmund;    Undismayed he will fight!    BRÜNNHILDE          He whom thou still        Hast taught me to love,        He whose courage high        To thy heart was so precious--    I will shield him in spite of    Thy wavering word!    WOTAN          Ha, daring one!        Floutest thou me?    Who art thou--who but the choiceless,    Blind slave of my will?        I have sunk so low        By showing my mind,        That the creature made by me        Holds me in scorn.    Dost thou, child, know my wrath?        If ever its awful        Lightning struck thee    Then quail wouldst thou indeed!        Within my bosom        Burns enough rage        To lay waste        In dread ruin a world    That once wore nothing but smiles.    Woe to him whom it strikes!    Dear the price he would pay!        So be advised,        Call it not forth    But carry out my commands.        Cut down Siegmund!    That is the Valkyrie's task.

I fight afraid.    Evil is my cause!            [_She gazes thoughtfully before her._          Woe! My Wälsung!        With sorrow sore    Must the faithful one falsely forsake thee!

She watches them for a moment, then          turns into the cave where her horse is, so that she          is completely hidden from the audience. Siegmund          and Sieglinde appear on the pass, Sieglinde          hurrying in front. Siegmund tries to stop her._    SIEGMUND          Wait here and rest;        Tarry a while!    SIEGLINDE          Farther! Farther!    SIEGMUND [_Embraces her with tender force, straining her to him._          No farther now!    O linger, woman most sweet!        From bliss when most blissful        Breaking away,        In headlong haste        Far thou hast fled,    So fleet that I lagged behind:        Through wood and field,        Over cliff and scaur,        Voiceless, silent,        Speeding along,    Thy foot stopped for no call.            [_Sieglinde stares wildly before her._          Tarry a while!        Say but a word,    Ending this speechless dread!        See, thy brother        Holds thee, his bride:    Siegmund's comrade art thou!    SIEGLINDE            [_Gazes into his eyes with growing rapture, throws          her arms passionately round his neck and remains so          for some time. She then starts up in wild terror._          Away! Away!        Fly the profaned one!        Unholy        The clasp of her arm;        In shame, dishonoured,        This body died.        Fling it from thee,        Flee from the corpse!    The winds scatter her dust--    The foul one who loved one so fair!    When in his loving embrace    She rested in rapture pure,    And all the love of the man    Was hers who loved him alone--        When on holiest height,        When bliss was at sweetest,        And sense and soul        Were steeped in delight,        Hatred and loathing        Of hideous dishonour        Shook the disgraced one,        Filled her with fear--    The thought she once had obeyed.    Bridegroom unloving, unloved.        Leave the accurst one,        Far let her fly!        An outcast she is,        Bereft of grace!        Ah, I must leave        The purest of heroes;        I cannot be thine,        To sully thy glory:    Scorn to bring on the brother,    Shame to the rescuing friend!    SIEGMUND      For the shame and dishonour,    Pay the transgressor's blood!        No farther, then, flying,        Here let us wait him;    Here--here I shall slay him:        When Nothung's point        Shall pierce his heart,        All thy wrongs will be avenged!    SIEGLINDE [_Starts up and listens._          Hark! The bugles!        Dost thou not hear?        All around,        Angry and shrill,        From wood and vale        Clamour their calls.        Hunding has wakened        From slumber deep;        Kinsmen and hounds        He summons together;        How the dogs howl,        Urged on hotly,    Loud-baying to heaven    Of the vows and the wedlock profaned!            [_Gazes before her as if gone crazed._          Where art thou, Siegmund?        Art thou still here,        Fervently loved one,        Beautiful brother?        Let thine eyes like stars    Shine again on me softly;        Turn not away    From the outcast woman's kiss!            [_She throws herself sobbing on his breast, and          presently starts up in terror again._          Hark! O hark!        That is Hunding's horn!        With his hounds full force,        In haste he comes.        No sword helps        When the dogs attack:--        Throw it down, Siegmund!        Siegmund, where art thou?        Ha, there! I see thee now!        Horrible sight!        Eager-fanged        Are the bloodhounds for flesh;        Ah, what to them        Is thy noble air!        By the feet they seize thee        With terrible teeth;        Alas!    Thou fallest with splintered sword:--        The ash-tree sinks--        The trunk is rent!        Brother! My brother!        Siegmund--ha!            [_She falls fainting into his arms._    [Illustration: Plate 28, Brünnhilde with her horse, at the mouth of the cave.]    SIEGMUND          Sister! Belovèd!

In this position both          remain till the end of the following scene. A long          silence, during which Siegmund bends over Sieglinde          with tender concern, and presses a long kiss on her          brow._            [_Brünnhilde, leading her horse, comes out of the          cave and walks slowly and solemnly towards the          front. She pauses and watches Siegmund from a          distance, then advances slowly again and stops when          she gets nearer. In one hand she carries her shield          and spear, the other rest on her horse's neck, and          thus she gravely stands looking at Siegmund._    BRÜNNHILDE          Siegmund!

On the battle-field only        Heroes view me;        He whom I greet    Is chosen and must go.    SIEGMUND            [_Looks into her eyes with a long steadfast and          searching gaze, then bows his head in thought and          finally turns resolutely to her again._          When thou dost lead,    Whither follows the hero?    BRÜNNHILDE          I lead thee        To Wotan;        The lot he has cast:    To Walhall must thou come.    SIEGMUND          In Walhall's hall        Wotan alone shall I find?    BRÜNNHILDE          A glorious host        Of heroes slain        Will greet thee there    With love holy and high.    SIEGMUND          Say if in Walhall    Sojourns my father, Wälse.

Don't you, Toto?\"    \"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, wagging his tail again.    \"But I've such wonderful news for you, Dorothy,\" cried the yellow hen;  \"I've--\"    \"Wait a minute, dear,\" interrupted the little girl; \"I've got to  introduce you all, first.  That's manners, Billina.  This,\" turning to  her traveling companions, \"is Mr. Tik-tok, who works by machinery  'cause his thoughts wind up, and his talk winds up, and his action  winds up--like a clock.\"    \"Do they all wind up together?\" asked the shaggy man.    \"No; each one separate.  But he works just lovely, and Tik-tok was a  good friend to me once, and saved my life--and Billina's life, too.\"    \"Is he alive?\" asked Button-Bright, looking hard at the copper man.    \"Oh, no, but his machinery makes him just as good as alive.\"  She  turned to the copper man and said politely: \"Mr. Tik-tok, these are my  new friends: the shaggy man, and Polly the Rainbow's Daughter, and  Button-Bright, and Toto.  Only Toto isn't a new friend, 'cause he's  been to Oz before.\"    The copper man bowed low, removing his copper hat as he did so.    \"I'm ve-ry pleased to meet Dor-o-thy's fr-r-r-r---\"  Here he stopped  short.    \"Oh, I guess his speech needs winding!\" said the little girl, running  behind the copper man to get the key off a hook at his back.  She wound  him up at a place under his right arm and he went on to say:    \"Par-don me for run-ning down.  I was a-bout to say I am pleased to  meet Dor-o-thy's friends, who must be my friends.\"  The words were  somewhat jerky, but plain to understand.    \"And this is Billina,\" continued Dorothy, introducing the yellow hen,  and they all bowed to her in turn.    \"I've such wonderful news,\" said the hen, turning her head so that one  bright eye looked full at Dorothy.    \"What is it, dear?\" asked the girl.    \"I've hatched out ten of the loveliest chicks you ever saw.\"    \"Oh, how nice!  And where are they, Billina?\"    \"I left them at home.  But they're beauties, I assure you, and all  wonderfully clever.  I've named them Dorothy.\"    \"Which one?\" asked the girl.    \"All of them,\" replied Billina.    \"That's funny.  Why did you name them all with the same name?\"    \"It was so hard to tell them apart,\" explained the hen.  \"Now, when I  call 'Dorothy,' they all come running to me in a bunch; it's much  easier, after all, than having a separate name for each.\"    \"I'm just dying to see 'em, Billina,\" said Dorothy, eagerly.  \"But tell  me, my friends, how did you happen to be here, in the Country of the  Winkies, the first of all to meet us?\"    \"I'll tell you,\" answered Tik-tok, in his monotonous voice, all the  sounds of his words being on one level--\"Prin-cess Oz-ma saw you in her  mag-ic pic-ture, and knew you were com-ing here; so she sent Bil-lin-a  and me to wel-come you as she could not come her-self; so  that--fiz-i-dig-le cum-so-lut-ing hy-ber-gob-ble in-tu-zib-ick--\"    \"Good gracious!  Whatever's the matter now?\" cried Dorothy, as the  copper man continued to babble these unmeaning words, which no one  could understand at all because they had no sense.    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright, who was half scared.  Polly whirled  away to a distance and turned to look at the copper man in a fright.    \"His thoughts have run down, this time,\" remarked Billina composedly,  as she sat on Tik-tok's shoulder and pruned her sleek feathers.  \"When  he can't think, he can't talk properly, any more than you can.  You'll  have to wind up his thoughts, Dorothy, or else I'll have to finish his  story myself.\"    Dorothy ran around and got the key again and wound up Tik-tok under his  left arm, after which he could speak plainly again.    \"Par-don me,\" he said, \"but when my thoughts run down, my speech has no  mean-ing, for words are formed on-ly by thought.  I was a-bout to say  that Oz-ma sent us to wel-come you and in-vite you to come straight to  the Em-er-ald Ci-ty.  She was too bus-y to come her-self, for she is  pre-par-ing for her birth-day cel-e-bra-tion, which is to be a grand  af-fair.\"    \"I've heard of it,\" said Dorothy, \"and I'm glad we've come in time to  attend.  Is it far from here to the Emerald City?\"    \"Not ve-ry far,\" answered Tik-tok, \"and we have plen-ty of time.  To-night we will stop at the pal-ace of the Tin Wood-man, and  to-mor-row night we will ar-rive at the Em-er-ald Ci-ty.\"    \"Goody!\" cried Dorothy.  \"I'd like to see dear Nick Chopper again.  How's his heart?\"    \"It's fine,\" said Billina; \"the Tin Woodman says it gets softer and  kindlier every day.  He's waiting at his castle to welcome you,  Dorothy; but he couldn't come with us because he's getting polished as  bright as possible for Ozma's party.\"    \"Well then,\" said Dorothy, \"let's start on, and we can talk more as we  go.\"    They proceeded on their journey in a friendly group, for Polychrome had  discovered that the copper man was harmless and was no longer afraid of  him.  Button-Bright was also reassured, and took quite a fancy to  Tik-tok.  He wanted the clockwork man to open himself, so that he might  see the wheels go round; but that was a thing Tik-tok could not do.  Button-Bright then wanted to wind up the copper man, and Dorothy  promised he should do so as soon as any part of the machinery ran down.  This pleased Button-Bright, who held fast to one of Tik-tok's copper  hands as he trudged along the road, while Dorothy walked on the other  side of her old friend and Billina perched by turns upon his shoulder  or his copper hat.  Polly once more joyously danced ahead and Toto ran  after her, barking with glee.  The shaggy man was left to walk behind;  but he didn't seem to mind that a bit, and whistled merrily or looked  curiously upon the pretty scenes they passed.    At last they came to a hilltop from which the tin castle of Nick  Chopper could plainly be seen, its towers glistening magnificently  under the rays of the declining sun.    \"How pretty!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"I've never seen the Emp'ror's new  house before.\"    \"He built it because the old castle was damp, and likely to rust his  tin body,\" said Billina.  \"All those towers and steeples and domes and  gables took a lot of tin, as you can see.\"    \"Is it a toy?\" asked Button-Bright softly.    \"No, dear,\" answered Dorothy; \"it's better than that.  It's the fairy  dwelling of a fairy prince.\"          15.  The Emperor's Tin Castle      The grounds around Nick Chopper's new house were laid out in pretty  flower-beds, with fountains of crystal water and statues of tin  representing the Emperor's personal friends.  Dorothy was astonished  and delighted to find a tin statue of herself standing on a tin  pedestal at a bend in the avenue leading up to the entrance.  It was  life-size and showed her in her sunbonnet with her basket on her arm,  just as she had first appeared in the Land of Oz.    \"Oh, Toto--you're there too!\" she exclaimed; and sure enough there was  the tin figure of Toto lying at the tin Dorothy's feet.    Also, Dorothy saw figures of the Scarecrow, and the Wizard, and Ozma,  and of many others, including Tik-tok.  They reached the grand tin  entrance to the tin castle, and the Tin Woodman himself came running  out of the door to embrace little Dorothy and give her a glad welcome.  He welcomed her friends as well, and the Rainbow's Daughter he declared  to be the loveliest vision his tin eyes had ever beheld.  He patted  Button-Bright's curly head tenderly, for he was fond of children, and  turned to the shaggy man and shook both his hands at the same time.    Nick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies, who was also known throughout  the Land of Oz as the Tin Woodman, was certainly a remarkable person.  He was neatly made, all of tin, nicely soldered at the joints, and his  various limbs were cleverly hinged to his body so that he could use  them nearly as well as if they had been common flesh.  Once, he told  the shaggy man, he had been made all of flesh and bones, as other  people are, and then he chopped wood in the forests to earn his living.  But the axe slipped so often and cut off parts of him--which he had  replaced with tin--that finally there was no flesh left, nothing but  tin; so he became a real tin woodman.  The wonderful Wizard of Oz had  given him an excellent heart to replace his old one, and he didn't at  all mind being tin.  Every one loved him, he loved every one; and he  was therefore as happy as the day was long.    The Emperor was proud of his new tin castle, and showed his visitors  through all the rooms.  Every bit of the furniture was made of brightly  polished tin--the tables, chairs, beds, and all--even the floors and  walls were of tin.    \"I suppose,\" said he, \"that there are no cleverer tinsmiths in all the  world than the Winkies.  It would be hard to match this castle in  Kansas; wouldn't it, little Dorothy?\"    \"Very hard,\" replied the child, gravely.    \"It must have cost a lot of money,\" remarked the shaggy man.    \"Money!  Money in Oz!\" cried the Tin Woodman.  \"What a queer idea!  Did  you suppose we are so vulgar as to use money here?\"    \"Why not?\" asked the shaggy man.    \"If we used money to buy things with, instead of love and kindness and  the desire to please one another, then we should be no better than the  rest of the world,\" declared the Tin Woodman.  \"Fortunately money is  not known in the Land of Oz at all.  We have no rich, and no poor; for  what one wishes the others all try to give him, in order to make him  happy, and no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use.\"    \"Good!\" cried the shaggy man, greatly pleased to hear this.  \"I also  despise money--a man in Butterfield owes me fifteen cents, and I will  not take it from him.  The Land of Oz is surely the most favored land  in all the world, and its people the happiest.  I should like to live  here always.\"    The Tin Woodman listened with respectful attention.  Already he loved  the shaggy man, although he did not yet know of the Love Magnet.  So he  "]]]
