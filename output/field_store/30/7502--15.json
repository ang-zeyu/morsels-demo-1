The economists cannot  deny that they have before them the fragments, scattered  pell-mell, of a chef-d'oeuvre, disjecti membra poetae; but it  has been impossible for them as yet to recover the general  design, and, whenever they have attempted any comparisons, they  have met only with incoherence.  Driven to despair at last by  their fruitless combinations, they have erected as a dogma the  architectural incongruity of the science, or, as they say, the  INCONVENIENCES of its principles; in a word, they have denied the  science.[7]      [7] \"The principle which governs the life of nations is not pure  science: it is the total of the complex data which depend on the  state of enlightenment, on needs and interests.\"  Thus expressed  itself, in December, 1844, one of the clearest minds that France  contained, M. Leon Faucher.  Explain, if you can, how a man of  this stamp was led by his economic convictions to declare that  the COMPLEX DATA of society are opposed to PURE SCIENCE.        Thus the division of labor, without which production would be  almost nothing, is subject to a thousand inconveniences, the  worst of which is the demoralization of the laborer; machinery  causes, not only cheapness, but obstruction of the market and  stoppage of business; competition ends in oppression; taxation,  the material bond of society, is generally a scourge dreaded  equally with fire and hail; credit is necessarily accompanied by  bankruptcy; property is a swarm of abuses; commerce degenerates  into a game of chance, in which it is sometimes allowable even to  cheat: in short, disorder existing everywhere to an equal extent  with order, and no one knowing how the latter is to banish the  former, taxis ataxien diokein, the economists have decided that  all is for the best, and regard every reformatory proposition as  hostile to political economy.    The social edifice, then, has been abandoned; the crowd has burst  into the wood-yard; columns, capitals, and plinths, wood, stone,  and metal, have been distributed in portions and drawn by lot:  and, of all these materials collected for a magnificent temple,  property, ignorant and barbarous, has built huts.  The work  before us, then, is not only to recover the plan of the edifice,  but to dislodge the occupants, who maintain that their city is  superb, and, at the very mention of restoration, appear in  battle-array at their gates.  Such confusion was not seen of old  at Babel: happily we speak French, and are more courageous than  the companions of Nimrod.    But enough of allegory: the historical and descriptive method,  successfully employed so long as the work was one of examination  only, is henceforth useless: after thousands of monographs and  tables, we are no further advanced than in the age of Xenophon  and Hesiod.  The Phenicians, the Greeks, the Italians, labored in  their day as we do in ours: they invested their money, paid their  laborers, extended their domains, made their expeditions and  recoveries, kept their books, speculated, dabbled in stocks, and  ruined themselves according to all the rules of economic art;  knowing as well as ourselves how to gain monopolies and fleece  the consumer and laborer.  Of all this accounts are only too  numerous; and, though we should rehearse forever our statistics  and our figures, we should always have before our eyes only  chaos,--chaos constant and uniform.    It is thought, indeed, that from the era of mythology to the  present year 57 of our great revolution, the general welfare has  improved: Christianity has long been regarded as the chief cause  of this amelioration, but now the economists claim all the honor  for their own principles.  For after all, they say, what has been  the influence of Christianity upon society?  Thoroughly utopian  at its birth, it has been able to maintain and extend itself only  by gradually adopting all the economic categories,--labor,  capital, farm-rent, usury, traffic, property; in short, by  consecrating the Roman law, the highest expression of political  economy.    Christianity, a stranger in its theological aspect to the  theories of production and consumption, has been to European  civilization what the trades-unions and free-masons were not long  since to itinerant workmen,--a sort of insurance company and  mutual aid society; in this respect, it owes nothing to political  economy, and the good which it has done cannot be invoked by the  latter in its own support.  The effects of charity and  self-sacrifice are outside of the domain of economy, which must  bring about social happiness through justice and the organization  of labor.  For the rest, I am ready to admit the beneficial  effects of the system of property; but I observe that these  effects are entirely balanced by the misery which it is the  nature of this system to produce; so that, as an illustrious  minister recently confessed before the English Parliament, and as  we shall soon show, the increase of misery in the present state  of society is parallel and equal to the increase of  wealth,--which completely annuls the merits of political economy.    Thus political economy is justified neither by its maxims nor by  its works; and, as for socialism, its whole value consists in  having established this fact.  We are forced, then, to resume the  examination of political economy, since it alone contains, at  least in part, the materials of social science; and to ascertain  whether its theories do not conceal some error, the correction of  which would reconcile fact and right, reveal the organic law of  humanity, and give the positive conception of order.        CHAPTER II.    OF VALUE.    % 1.--Opposition of value in USE and value in EXCHANGE.    Value is the corner-stone of the economic edifice.  The divine  artist who has intrusted us with the continuation of his work has  explained himself on this point to no one; but the few  indications given may serve as a basis of conjecture.  Value, in  fact, presents two faces: one, which the economists call value in  USE, or intrinsic value; another, value in EXCHANGE, or of  opinion.  The effects which are produced by value under this  double aspect, and which are very irregular so long as it is not  established,--or, to use a more philosophical expression, so long  as it is not constituted,--are changed totally by this  constitution.    Now, in what consists the correlation between USEFUL value and  value in EXCHANGE?  What is meant by CONSTITUTED value, and by  what sudden change is this constitution effected?  To answer  these questions is the object and end of political economy.  I  beg the reader to give his whole attention to what is to follow,  this chapter being the only one in the work which will tax his  patience.  For my part, I will endeavor to be more and more  simple and clear.    Everything which can be of any service to me is of value to me,  and the more abundant the useful thing is the richer I am: so  far there is no difficulty.  Milk and flesh, fruits and grains,  wool, sugar, cotton, wine, metals, marble; in fact, land, water,  air, fire, and sunlight,-- are, relatively to me, values of use,  values by nature and function.  If all the things which serve to  sustain my life were as abundant as certain of them are, light  for instance,--in other words, if the quantity of every valuable  thing was inexhaustible,--my welfare would be forever assured: I  should not have to labor; I should not even think.  In such a  state, things would always be USEFUL, but it would be no longer  true to say that they ARE VALUABLE; for value, as we shall soon  see, indicates an essentially social relation; and it is solely  through exchange, reverting as it were from society to Nature,  that we have acquired the idea of utility.  The whole development  of civilization originates, then, in the necessity which the  human race is under of continually causing the creation of new  values; just as the evils of society are primarily caused by the  perpetual struggle which we maintain against our own inertia.  Take away from man that desire which leads him to think and fits  him for a life of contemplation, and the lord of creation stands  on a level with the highest of the beasts.    But how does value in use become value in exchange?  For it  should be noticed that the two kinds of value, although  coexisting in thought (since the former becomes apparent only in  the presence of the latter), nevertheless maintain a relation of  succession: exchangeable value is a sort of reflex of useful  value; just as the theologians teach that in the Trinity the  Father, contemplating himself through all eternity, begets the  Son.  This generation of the idea of value has not been noted by  the economists with sufficient care: it is important that we  should tarry over it.    Since, then, of the objects which I need, a very large number  exist in Nature only in moderate quantities, or even not at all,  I am forced to assist in the production of that which I lack;  and, as I cannot turn my hand to so many things, I propose to  other men, my collaborators in various functions, to yield me a  portion of their products in exchange for mine.  I shall then  always have in my possession more of my own special product than  I consume; just as my fellows will always have in their  possession more of their respective products than they use.  This  tacit agreement is fulfilled by COMMERCE.  Here we may observe  that the logical succession of the two kinds of value is even  more apparent in history than in theory, men having spent  thousands of years in disputing over natural wealth (this being  what is called PRIMITIVE COMMUNISM) before their industry  afforded opportunity for exchange.    Now, the capacity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#14)"],[1,"the _records of the  courts_, in the highest state of preservation.    Governor Cumming was perfectly amazed. Was it possible his eyes did not  deceive him? Were these the veritable records about which so much had  been said? They were; and the Mormons had been belied, and the  Government deceived. He immediately wrote to the President and to Col.  Johnson, and explained how matters stood.    The gifted and accomplished Col. Kane was the bearer of these documents  to his venerable friend James Buchanan, who read with delight these  \"signs of repentance\" on the part of his dear children, and immediately  commenced writing their pardon.    It has been supposed by many that Col. Kane was, at that time, acting as  the agent of the United States Government. But the following extract  from a letter to him, written by President Buchanan, dated December 31,  1857, will at once determine the position which the Colonel occupied:--         \"MY DEAR SIR,--You furnish the strongest evidence of your       desire to serve the Mormons, by abandoning the comforts of       friends, family, and home, and voluntarily encountering the       perils and dangers of a journey to Utah, at the present       inclement season of the year, at your own expense, and without       official position. . . . Nothing but pure philanthropy, and a       strong desire to serve the Mormon people, could have dictated       a course so much at war with your private interests.\"    While the President was penning his proclamation of pardon, the Mormons  were leaving their property and homes, and taking up their line of march  for the South. Governor Cumming was unable to control the movements of  Col. Johnson, who was acting under instructions from the Secretary of  War. Hence Cumming could not save to Brigham, however much he might feel  disposed to do so, the humiliation of seeing the streets of the city  filled with the federal soldiers, against whom he had been hurling his  anathemas. Finding this catastrophe could not possibly be averted, he  promulgated an order, purporting to emanate from the Almighty,  commanding the people to leave their homes and start for the South. This  order was prompted partly by the fact that the \"President of the Church\"  was committed to this course by his repeated declarations, and partly  by the wish on his part to test his power over \"this people.\" It was  readily and implicitly obeyed by his deluded followers. They knew not  where they were going. Many believed they were destined for Sonora. They  only knew the Prophet of the Lord had spoken, and they must obey.    On the 6th of April, 1858, their long trains moved southward, taking  with them their household goods, and provisions for the journey.  Brigham, Heber, and the principal men, also removed their families from  their comfortable homes, again to encounter the toils and privations  incident to life on the Plains. They went to Provo, 50 miles from the  city, and there halted. The snow was still on the ground, and the  pilgrims suffered much from the inclemency of the weather.    On the 12th of April, Mr. Buchanan appointed L. W. Powell, of Kentucky,  and Ben McCulloch, of Texas, Commissioners to Utah, and by them sent on  his proclamation of pardon. They reached Salt Lake on the 7th of June,  and immediately made known their business to the Mormon authorities.  They were instructed to say to the Mormons, in the language of the  proclamation, \"If you obey the laws, keep the peace, and respect the  just rights of others, you will be perfectly secure, and may live in  your present faith, or change it for another at your pleasure. Every  intelligent man among you knows very well that the Government has never,  directly or indirectly, sought to molest you in your worship, to control  you in your ecclesiastical affairs, or even to influence you in your  religious opinions.\"    The following extracts from the report of the Commissioners will serve  to show the result of their mission:--         \"We stated that we wished a free conference with them, and       were ready to hear what they had to say. Ex-Governor Brigham       Young, Lieut.-Governor Wells, and others, spoke. They       expressed their gratification that the President had sent       commissioners to Utah. They stated that they were attached to       the Constitution and the Government of the United States; they       spoke harshly of many of the officials who had held office in       the Territory; they spoke of the wrongs and injuries hitherto       done them; they said they desired to live in peace, under the       Constitution of the United States. They denied that they had       ever driven any officials from Utah, or prevented any civil       officer from entering the Territory. They admitted that they       burned the army trains, and drove off the cattle from the army       last fall, and for that act they accepted the President's       pardon. All the charges that had been made against them,       except the one last named, they denied. . . . We are pleased       to state that the conference resulted in their agreeing to       receive, quietly and peaceably, all the civil officers of the       Government, and not to resist them in the execution of the       duties of their offices; and to yield obedience to the       authorities and laws of the United States.         \"That they would offer no resistance to the army; that the       officers of the army would not be resisted in the execution of       their orders within the Territory. In short, they agreed that       the officers, civil and military, of the United States, should       enter the Territory without resistance, and exercise,       peaceably and unmolested, all the functions of their various       offices.\"    The Mormons, on their part, stipulated that the army should not be  encamped within forty miles of the city; that they should protect  private property; that they should march directly through the city,  without halting; and should not encamp until they crossed the Jordan.  These conditions were substantially complied with. \"On the 26th of June  General Johnson marched the army under his command through Salt Lake  City, and encamped on the banks of the river Jordan, just without the  city limits. The place selected for a permanent camp was in Cedar  Valley, about forty miles south of Great Salt Lake City, and known as  Camp Floyd, now Fort Crittenden.\"    On the 5th of July, 1858, the Mormon refugees received orders to return  to their homes. With joy and alacrity they prepared to obey the welcome  summons.    Governor Cumming had frequently urged them to return, without avail. But  when the \"mighty man of God\" sent forth his mandate, each man sprang to  his feet as if by magic, rushed to his teams, and before the morning  sun gilded the eastern hills, \"the faithful\" were again returning to  their Mecca.    A company of United States troops were stationed on what was called \"the  Dug Out,\" to prevent collision with the Mormons on their return to Salt  Lake. The officer commanding related to me the following incident:--         \"I witnessed the most extreme destitution among the returning       emigrants. I saw a number of women cooking around a camp-fire,       and their clothing was extremely scanty. The supply of a       family of fourteen persons could have been compressed into a       small-sized trunk. One evening I saw two or three women       cooking supper, and observing that they had neither tea nor       coffee, I questioned them, and they replied they had had none       for two or three years. At this time, according to report, it       took a four-mule team to draw the Prophet's gold and silver,       besides some that went in other conveyances.\"    The saints again entered into possession of their deserted homes, and  began, as well as the lateness of the season would permit, to cultivate  their farms and gardens.    Thus ended this crusade against the modern Mohammed and his followers.      FOOTNOTES:    [49:A] _Deseret News_, November 18, 1857.    [52:A] John Hyde, Jr., in his work on Mormonism, page 146, says:  \"Fillmore, by the advice and intercession of Col. Kane, _who had  embraced Mormonism in Iowa_, appointed Brigham as the Governor of  Utah.\"          CHAPTER V.    POLITICAL HISTORY CONTINUED.         The Mountain Meadow Massacre and other Crimes of the Mormons.       --Attempts to bring the Perpetrators to Justice.--Doings of       Judge Cradlebaugh.--Governor Cumming and the Military Officers.       --Judge Sinclair's Court.--Governor Dawson and his Misfortune.       --New Governor and Associate Justices appointed.      The darkest chapter of Mormon history is now before us. It becomes my  duty to relate one of the most perfidious acts of cruelty and wholesale  butchery to be found in the annals of this or any other country. In  doing so, free use will be made of the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh  and others who were thoroughly conversant with all the facts.    The following is from the able speech of Judge Cradlebaugh, delivered in  the House of Representatives on the 7th of February, 1863:--         \"As one of the Associate Justices of the Territory of Utah, in       the month of April, 1859, I commenced and held a term of the       District Court for the Second Judicial District, in the city       of Provo, about sixty miles south of Salt Lake City. Upon my       requisition, Gen. A. S. Johnson, in command of the military       department, furnished a small military force for the purpose       of protecting the court. A grand jury was empanelled, and       their attention was pointedly and specifically called to a       great number of crimes that had been committed in the       immediate vicinity,--cases of public notoriety, both as to the       offence and the persons who had perpetrated the same; (for       none of these things had \"been done in a corner\").
