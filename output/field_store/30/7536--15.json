If they had been  all Indian--Chipewyan, Cree, Ojibway, Dog Rib--anything--there would  have been no trouble at all in the matter. He would have bent them to  his power, and Nepeese would have come to his cabin, as Marie had come  six months ago. But there was the accursed French of it! Pierrot and  Nepeese were different. And yet--    He smiled grimly, and his hands clenched tighter. After all, was not  his power sufficient? Would even Pierrot dare stand up against that? If  Pierrot objected, he would drive him from the country--from the  trapping regions that had come down to him as heritage from father and  grandfather, and even before their day. He would make of Pierrot a  wanderer and an outcast, as he had made wanderers and outcasts of a  score of others who had lost his favor. No other Post would sell to or  buy from Pierrot if Le Bete--the black cross--was put after his name.  That was his power--a law of the factors that had come down through the  centuries. It was a tremendous power for evil. It had brought him  Marie, the slim, dark-eyed Cree girl, who hated him--and who in spite  of her hatred \"kept house for him.\"    That was the polite way of explaining her presence if explanations were  ever necessary. McTaggart looked again at the notes he had made on the  sheet of paper. Pierrot's trapping country, his own property according  to the common law of the wilderness, was very valuable. During the last  seven years he had received an average of a thousand dollars a year for  his furs, for McTaggart had been unable to cheat Pierrot quite as  completely as he had cheated the Indians. A thousand dollars a year!  Pierrot would think twice before he gave that up. McTaggart chuckled as  he crumpled the paper in his hand and prepared to put out the light.  Under his close-cropped beard his reddish face blazed with the fire  that was in his blood. It was an unpleasant face--like iron, merciless,  filled with the look that gave him his name of Napao Wetikoo. His eyes  gleamed, and he drew a quick breath as he put out the light.    He chuckled again as he made his way through the darkness to the door.  Nepeese as good as belonged to him. He, would have her if it  cost--PIERROT'S LIFE. And--WHY NOT? It was all so easy. A shot on a  lonely trap line, a single knife thrust--and who would know? Who would  guess where Pierrot had gone? And it would all be Pierrot's fault. For  the last time he had seen Pierrot, he had made an honest proposition:  he would marry Nepeese. Yes, even that. He had told Pierrot so. He had  told Pierrot that when the latter was his father-in-law, he would pay  him double price for furs.    And Pierrot had stared--had stared with that strange, stunned look in  his face, like a man dazed by a blow from a club. And so if he did not  get Nepeese without trouble it would all be Pierrot's fault. Tomorrow  McTaggart would start again for the half-breed's country. And the next  day Pierrot would have an answer for him. Bush McTaggart chuckled again  as he went to bed.    Until the next to the last day Pierrot said nothing to Nepeese about  what had passed between him and the factor at Lac Bain. Then he told  her.    \"He is a beast--a man-devil,\" he said, when he had finished. \"I would  rather see you out there--with her--dead.\" And he pointed to the tall  spruce under which the princess mother lay.    Nepeese had not uttered a sound. But her eyes had grown bigger and  darker, and there was a flush in her cheeks which Pierrot had never  seen there before. She stood up when he had finished, and she seemed  taller to him. Never had she looked quite so much like a woman, and  Pierrot's eyes were deep-shadowed with fear and uneasiness as he  watched her while she gazed off into the northwest--toward Lac Bain.    She was wonderful, this slip of a girl-woman. Her beauty troubled him.  He had seen the look in Bush McTaggart's eyes. He had heard the thrill  in McTaggart's voice. He had caught the desire of a beast in  McTaggart's face. It had frightened him at first. But now--he was not  frightened. He was uneasy, but his hands were clenched. In his heart  there was a smoldering fire. At last Nepeese turned and came and sat  down beside him again, at his feet.    \"He is coming tomorrow, ma cherie,\" he said. \"What shall I tell him?\"    The Willow's lips were red. Her eyes shone. But she did not look up at  her father.    \"Nothing, Nootawe--except that you are to say to him that I am the one  to whom he must come--for what he seeks.\"    Pierrot bent over and caught her smiling. The sun went down. His heart  sank with it, like cold lead.      From Lac Bain to Pierrot's cabin the trail cut within half a mile of  the beaver pond, a dozen miles from where Pierrot lived. And it was  here, on a twist of the creek in which Wakayoo had caught fish for  Baree, that Bush McTaggart made his camp for the night. Only twenty  miles of the journey could be made by canoe, and as McTaggart was  traveling the last stretch afoot, his camp was a simple affair--a few  cut balsams, a light blanket, a small fire. Before he prepared his  supper, the factor drew a number of copper wire snares from his small  pack and spent half an hour in setting them in rabbit runways. This  method of securing meat was far less arduous than carrying a gun in hot  weather, and it was certain. Half a dozen snares were good for at least  three rabbits, and one of these three was sure to be young and tender  enough for the frying pan. After he had placed his snares McTaggart set  a skillet of bacon over the coals and boiled his coffee.    Of all the odors of a camp, the smell of bacon reaches farthest in the  forest. It needs no wind. It drifts on its own wings. On a still night  a fox will sniff it a mile away--twice that far if the air is moving in  the right direction. It was this smell of bacon that came to Baree  where he lay in his hollow on top of the beaver dam.    Since his experience in the canyon and the death of Wakayoo, he had not  fared particularly well. Caution had kept him near the pond, and he had  lived almost entirely on crayfish. This new aroma that came with the  night wind roused his hunger. But it was elusive: now he could smell  it--the next instant it was gone. He left the dam and began questing  for the source of it in the forest, until after a time he lost it  altogether. McTaggart had finished frying his bacon and was eating it.    It was a splendid night that followed. Perhaps Baree would have slept  through it in his nest on the top of the dam if the bacon smell had not  stirred the new hunger in him. Since his adventure in the canyon, the  deeper forest had held a dread for him, especially at night. But this  night was like a pale, golden day. It was moonless; but the stars shone  like a billion distant lamps, flooding the world in a soft and billowy  sea of light. A gentle whisper of wind made pleasant sounds in the  treetops. Beyond that it was very quiet, for it was Puskowepesim--the  Molting Moon--and the wolves were not hunting, the owls had lost their  voice, the foxes slunk with the silence of shadows, and even the  beavers had begun to cease their labors. The horns of the moose, the  deer, and the caribou were in tender velvet, and they moved but little  and fought not at all. It was late July, Molting Moon of the Cree, Moon  of Silence for the Chipewyan.    In this silence Baree began to hunt. He stirred up a family of  half-grown partridges, but they escaped him. He pursued a rabbit that  was swifter than he. For an hour he had no luck. Then he heard a sound  that made every drop of blood in him thrill. He was close to  McTaggart's camp, and what he had heard was a rabbit in one of  McTaggart's snares. He came out into a little starlit open and there he  saw the rabbit going through a most marvelous pantomime. It amazed him  for a moment, and he stopped in his tracks.    Wapoos, the rabbit, had run his furry head into the snare, and his  first frightened jump had \"shot\" the sapling to which the copper wire  was attached so that he was now hung half in mid-air, with only his  hind feet touching the ground. And there he was dancing madly while the  noose about his neck slowly choked him to death.    Baree gave a sort of gasp. He could understand nothing of the part that  the wire and the sapling were playing in this curious game. All he  could see was that Wapoos was hopping and dancing about on his hind  legs in a most puzzling and unrabbitlike fashion. It may be that he  thought it some sort of play. In this instance, however, he did not  regard Wapoos as he had looked on Umisk the beaver. He knew that Wapoos  made mighty fine eating, and after another moment or two of hesitation  he darted upon his prey.    Wapoos, half gone already, made almost no struggle, and in the glow of  the stars Baree finished him, and for half an hour afterward he feasted.    McTaggart had heard no sound, for the snare into which Wapoos had run  his head was the one set farthest from his camp. Beside the smoldering  coals of his fire he sat with his back to a tree, smoking his black  pipe and dreaming covetously of Nepeese, while Baree continued his  night wandering. Baree no longer had the desire to hunt. He was too  full. But he nosed in and out of the starlit spaces, enjoying immensely  the stillness and the golden glow of the night. He was following a  rabbit-run when he came to a place where two fallen logs left a trail  no wider than his body. He squeezed through; something tightened about  his neck. There was a sudden snap--a swish as the sapling was released  from its \"trigger\"--and Baree was jerked off his feet so suddenly that  he had no time to conjecture as to what was happening.    The yelp in his throat died in a gurgle, and the next moment he was  going"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#14)"],[1,"before us. America will be a Zion to all that  choose to come to it; and if the churches in foreign countries wish  to come, let them do so. Say to brother P. P.

May peace rest upon him  in life and in death.    \"Brethren, pray for us, and cease not till our deliverance comes, which  we hope may come. We _hope_, we say, for our families' sake.    \"Let the Elders preach nothing but the first principles of the gospel,  and let them publish our afflictions--the injustice and cruelty  thereof, upon the house tops. Let them write it and publish it in all  the papers where they go.

S.\"    On the 7th of February, 1839, I accompanied Brother Brigham to Liberty,  to visit Joseph and the brethren in prison. We had the privilege of  going in to see and converse with them. We stayed at Liberty over  night, and the next morning we were permitted to visit the prisoners  again, while they were at breakfast. We returned during the day to Far  West.    When we left there, Lyman Sherman was somewhat unwell, and in a few  days after our return he died. We did not notify him of his appointment.    I fitted up a small wagon, procured a span of ponies, and sent my wife  and three children out of the State in company with Brother Brigham  Young and his family, and several others, who left Far West February  14th. Everything my family took with them out of Missouri, could have  been packed on the backs of two horses; the mob took all the rest.    Being a stranger in Missouri, I was requested by Joseph, Brigham and  others to tarry and assist the committee in getting the brethren and  families out of the State, and in waiting upon those brethren who were  confined in prison.    On the 12th of March, I wrote to Joseph Fielding, Liverpool, England,  saying: \"I have only received two letters from you since I have come  here. If you knew the feelings I have for the welfare of that people,  your pen would not be so idle. May God stir you up to diligence to  feed the sheep of God; for they are children of my begetting through  the gospel. Think it not strange that I speak thus; for you know the  feelings that a father has for his children.    \"Now, brethren, be faithful and visit the churches, and exhort the  Saints to be faithful in all things, and not lay down their watch for  a moment; for there is great danger of falling beneath the powers of  darkness. Don't think hard of me, brethren, for my plainness, for I  am a plain man, and God requires it of me, and the same of you. Don't  keep the Saints in ignorance of those things I have made you acquainted  with--that is, our sufferings, for they will know them when I come, and  they will have to pass through similar scenes. Don't be selfish; for it  will not impoverish you to tell them all that I tell you.    \"Your sister Mary left here about eight weeks ago, also the rest of the  wives of the prisoners, thinking that they would be out in a few days.  There are ten in prison; they are all well and in good spirits. I am  going to see them to-morrow if the Lord will.    \"Mobs are common in this country; it is getting so that there is no  safety anywhere in this land. Prepare yourselves for trouble wherever  you go, for it awaits you and all others that love the Lord and keep  His commandments.    \"Brethren, I want you to go to the north where Brother Russell labored,  and see what situation the Saints are in, for I have some fears about  them. Go and strengthen them in the name of the Lord. * * * * * *    \"Brethren, I can truly say that I have never seen the Church in a  better state since I have been a member of it. What there are left are  firm and steadfast, full of love and good works. They have lost all  their earthly goods, and are now ready to go and preach the gospel  to a dying world. We have ordained about one hundred Elders into the  Seventies. There are about one hundred and fifty who have gone into the  vineyard this winter to preach the gospel, and many more will go in the  spring, and several will come to England with me in the summer or fall.  Elder Rigdon was bailed out of prison, and has left Missouri. About ten  thousand had gathered to this State. By the 1st of May next there will  not be one left who has any faith. Not one-fourth part had any teams to  move with, and we had two hundred miles to travel before we could get  out of the State. I think their deliverance is a great miracle.\"    About this time, Orson Hyde came to me, feeling very sorrowful for the  course he had pursued the past few months. He said it was because of  fear, and that he lamented his folly, and he asked me what he should  do. I told him to give up his school, remove his family and gather with  the Church. He wanted to know if I thought the brethren would forgive  him. I said, \"Yes.\"    He then asked, \"Will you defend my case?\" and I promised him I would.    On the 15th, the Prophet Joseph and others petitioned Judge Tompkins,  or either of the supreme judges of the State of Missouri, for a States  writ of _habeas corpus_, that he and his brethren might be brought  before either of those judges, that justice might be administered. I  was requested by Joseph to go to Jefferson and present the petition.    Theodore Turley accompanied me. We took copies of the papers by which  the prisoners were held, with the petition to the supreme judges, and  immediately started a distance of three hundred miles. We visited the  judges, and laid the whole matter before them individually, according  to our best ability. Neither of them would take any action in the  case, although they appeared friendly and acknowledged that they were  illegally imprisoned. We also presented a petition to the secretary of  state, the governor being absent. He appeared very kind, but like the  other officers, he _had no power to do good_.    We immediately returned to Liberty, where we arrived on the 3rd,  and made Joseph and the prisoners acquainted with the result of our  mission--through the gate of the dungeon, as we were not permitted to  enter the prison.    Joseph told us to be of good cheer, for the Lord would deliver him and  his brethren in due time. He also told us to advise the brethren to  keep up their spirits, and get all the Saints away as fast as possible.    In company with Brother Turley, I visited Judge Austin A. King, who was  vexed at us for presenting his illegal papers to the supreme judges. He  treated us very roughly.    I returned to Far West April 5th, and remained a few days. My family  having been gone about two months (during which time I heard nothing  from them), our brethren being in prison, and death and destruction  following us wherever we went, I felt very sorrowful and lonely. While  in this condition, the following words came to my mind, and the Spirit  said unto me, \"write.\" I obeyed by taking a piece of paper and writing  on my knee, as follows:    \"FAR WEST,    \"April 6, 1839.    \"_A Word from the Spirit of the Lord to My Servant Heber C. Kimball_:    \"Verily, I say unto my servant Heber, thou art my son in whom I am  well pleased; for thou art careful to hearken to my words, and not  transgress my law nor rebel against my servant Joseph Smith; for thou  hast a respect to the words of mine anointed, even from the least to  the greatest of them; therefore, thy name is written in heaven, no more  to be blotted out forever, because of these things; and this spirit and  blessing shall rest down upon thy posterity forever and ever; for they  shall be called after thy name, for thou shalt have many more sons and  daughters, for thy seed shall be as numerous as the sands upon the sea  shore. Therefore, my servant Heber, be faithful; go forth in my name  and I will go with you, and be on your right hand and on your left,  and my angels shall go before you and raise you up when you are cast  down and afflicted. Remember that I am always with you, even to the  end; therefore, be of good cheer, my son, and my Spirit shall be in  your heart, to teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom. Trouble  not thyself about thy family, for they are in my hands; I will feed  them and clothe them and make unto them friends. They never shall want  for food nor raiment, houses nor lands, fathers nor mothers, brothers  nor sisters; and peace shall rest upon them forever, if thou wilt be  faithful and go forth and preach my gospel to the nations of the earth;  for thou shalt be blessed in this thing. Thy tongue shall be loosed  to such a degree that has not entered into thy heart as yet, and the  children of men shall believe thy words, and flock to the water, even  as they did to my servant John; for thou shalt be great in winning  souls to me, for this is thy gift and calling. And there shall be no  gift withheld from thee, if thou art faithful; therefore, be faithful,  and I will give thee favor in the eyes of the people. Be humble and  kind, and thou shalt obtain kindness; be merciful, and thou shalt  obtain mercy; and I will be with thee even unto the end. Amen.\"        CHAPTER XIII.
