In these  letters Oliver Cowdery gives an account of the young Prophet's first  visit to Cumorah that is much more circumstantial than the description  of that event by the Prophet, and which Oliver Cowdery could only have  learned from Joseph himself. It will be remembered that in the account  already quoted from the personal history of the Prophet Joseph that he  said the angel Moroni had warned him that Satan would tempt him, on  account of his father's indigent circumstances, to obtain the plates  for the purpose of getting rich; but this he must not do, nor have  any other object in view than that of glorifying God; and he must be  influenced by no other consideration than that of building up God's  kingdom. Otherwise, he could not get possession of the plates. And now  Cowdery's account of the young Prophet's first visit to Cumorah. After  quoting the instructions of the angel, directing Joseph to go to the  hill Cumorah, Cowdery says:        Accordingly he repaired to the place which had thus been described.      But it is necessary to give you more fully the express instructions      of the angel with regard to the object of this work in which our      brother [meaning, of course, Joseph Smith] had now engaged. He was      to remember that it was the work of the Lord, to fulfill certain      promises previously made to a branch of the house of Israel of the      tribe of Joseph, and when it was brought forth it must be done      expressly with an eye, as I have said before, single to the glory      of God, and the welfare and restoration of the house of Israel. You      will understand, then, that no motive of a pecuniary or earthly      nature, was to be suffered to take the lead in the heart of the man      thus favored. The allurements of vice, the contaminating influences      of wealth, without the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit, must      have no place in his heart nor be suffered to take from it that      warm desire for the glory and kingdom of the Lord, or, instead of      obtaining, disappointment and reproof would most assuredly follow.      Such was the instruction and the caution. Alternately, as we would      naturally expect, the thought of the previous vision was ruminating      in his mind, with a reflection of the brightness and glory of the      heavenly messenger; but again a thought would start across the mind      on the prospects of obtaining so desirable a treasure--one in all      human probability sufficient to raise him above the level of the      common earthly fortunes of his fellow men, and relieve his family      from want, in which by misfortune and sickness they were placed.      * * * Here was a struggle indeed; for when he calmly reflected      upon his errand, he knew that if God did not give, he could not      obtain; and again, with the thought or hope of obtaining, his      mind would be carried back to its former reflections of poverty,      abuse, wealth, grandeur and ease, until before arriving at the      place described, this wholly occupied his desire; and when he      thought upon the fact of what was previously shown him, it was      only with an assurance that he should obtain, and accomplish his      desire in relieving himself and friends from want. * * * You will      have wondered, perhaps, that the mind of our brother should be so      occupied with the thoughts of the goods of this world, at the time      of arriving at Cumorah, on the morning of the 22nd of September,      1823, after having been wrapt in the visions of heaven, during the      night, and also seeing and hearing in open day; but the mind of man      is easily turned if it is not held by the power of God through the      prayer of faith, and you will remember that I have said that two      invisible powers were operating upon his mind during his walk from      his residence to Cumorah, and that the one urging the certainty of      wealth and ease in this life, had so powerfully wrought upon him      that the great object so carefully and impressively named by the      angel, had entirely gone from his recollection that only a fixed      determination to obtain now urged him forward. In this, which      occasioned a failure to obtain, at that time, the record, do not      understand me to attach blame to our brother; he was young, and      his mind easily turned from correct principles, unless he could be      favored with a certain round of experience. And yet, while young,      untraditioned and untaught in the systems of the world, he was in a      situation to be led into the great work of God, and be qualified to      perform it in due time.        After arriving at the repository, a little exertion in removing      the soil from the edges of the top of the box, and a light pry,      brought to his natural vision its contents. No sooner did he behold      this sacred treasure than his hopes were renewed, and he supposed      his success certain and, without first attempting to take it from      its place of long deposit, he thought, perhaps, there might be      something more, equally as valuable, and to take only the plates      might give others an opportunity of obtaining the remainder, which      could he secure, would still add to his store of wealth. These, in      short, were his reflections, without once thinking of the solemn      instruction of the heavenly messenger, and that all must be done      with an express view of glorifying God.        On attempting to take possession of the record a shock was produced      upon his system, by an invisible power, which deprived him, in a      measure, of his natural strength. He desisted, for an instant,      and then made another attempt, but was more sensibly shocked than      before. What was the occasion of this he knew not--there was the      pure unsullied record, as has been described--he had heard of the      powers of enchantment, and a thousand like stories, which held      the hidden treasures of the earth, and supposed that physical      exertion and personal strength was only necessary to enable him      to yet obtain the object of his wish. He therefore made the third      attempt with an increased exertion, when his strength failed him      more than at either of the former times, and without premeditating      he exclaimed, \"Why can I not obtain this book?\" \"Because you      have not kept the commandments of the Lord,\" answered a voice,      within a seeming short distance. He looked and to his astonishment      there stood the angel who had previously given him the directions      concerning this matter. In an instant, all the former instructions,      the great intelligence concerning Israel and the last days were      brought to his mind; he thought of the time when his heart was      fervently engaged in prayer to the Lord, when his spirit was      contrite, and when this holy messenger from the skies unfolded      the wonderful things connected with this record. He had come to      be sure, and found the word of the angel fulfilled concerning the      reality of the records, but he had failed to remember the great end      for which they had been kept, and in consequence could not have      power to take them into his possession and bear them away.        At that instant he looked to the Lord in prayer, and as he prayed,      darkness began to disperse from his mind and his soul was lit up as      it was the evening before, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit;      and again did the Lord manifest his condescension and mercy; the      heavens were opened and the glory of the Lord shone around about      and rested upon him. While thus he stood gazing and admiring, the      angel said, \"Look!\" and as he thus spake he beheld the prince of      darkness, surrounded by his innumerable train of associates. All      this passed before him, and the heavenly messenger said, \"All this      is shown, the good and the evil, the holy and impure, the glory      of God and the power of darkness, that you may know hereafter the      two powers and never be influenced or overcome by that wicked      one. Behold, whatever entices and leads to good and to do good,      is of God, and whatever does not is of that wicked one: it is he      that fills the hearts of men with evil, to walk in darkness and      blaspheme God; and you may learn from henceforth, that his ways      are to destruction, but the way of holiness is peace and rest. You      now see why you could not obtain this record; that the commandment      was strict, and that if ever these sacred things are obtained they      must be by prayer and faithfulness in obeying the Lord. They are      not deposited here for the sake of accumulating gain and wealth      for the glory of this world: they were sealed by the prayer of      faith, and because of the knowledge which they contain they are of      no worth among the children of men, only for their knowledge. On      them is contained the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it      was given to his people on this land, and when it shall be brought      forth by the power of God it shall be carried to the Gentiles, of      whom many will receive it, and after will the seed of Israel be      brought into the fold of their Redeemer by obeying it also. Those      who kept the commandments of the Lord on this land, through the      prayer of faith obtained the promise, that if their descendants      should transgress and fall away, a record should be kept and in      the last days come to their children. These things are sacred,      and must be kept so, for the promise of the Lord concerning them      must be fulfilled. No man can obtain them if his heart is impure,      because they contain that which is sacred; and besides, should they      be entrusted in unholy hands the knowledge could not come to the      world, because they cannot be interpreted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#14)"],[1,"the tabernacle, had  he had any suspicion that it was standing empty at Gibeon, in the  immediate neighbourhood, he would have been relieved of all  difficulty.  But inasmuch as the ark brings blessing to the house  of Obed-Edom,--the ark, be it remembered, in the house of a soldier  and a Philistine, yet bringing down, not wrath, but blessing,--/1/    *********************************************  1. The Chronicle has good reason for making him a Levite. But Gath  without any qualifying epithet, and particularly in connection with David,  is the Philistine Gath, and Obed-Edom belongs to the bodyquard, which  consisted chiefly of foreigners and Philistines. His name,  moreover, is hardly Israelite.  **********************************************    the king is thereby encouraged to persevere after all with his original  proposal, and establish it upon his citadel.  And this he does in a tent  he had caused to be made for it (2Samuel vi.17), which tent of David  in Zion continued to be its lodging until the temple was built.  Some mention of the tabernacle, had it existed, would have been  inevitable when the temple took its place.  That it did not serve  as the model of the temple has already been said; but it might  have been expected at least that in the account of the building of  the new sanctuary some word might have escaped about the  whereabouts of the old.  And this expectation seems to be realised  in 1Kings viii.4, which says that when the temple was finished  there were brought into it, besides the ark, the Ohel Moed and all  the sacred vessels that were therein.  Interpreters hesitate as to  whether they ought to understand by the Ohel Moed the tent of the  ark upon Zion, to which alone reference has been made in the  preceding narrative (1Kings i.39, ii.28-30), or whether it is the  Mosaic tent, which, according to Chronicles, was standing at  Gibeon, but of which the Book of Kings tells nothing, and also  knows nothing (iii.2-4).  It is probable that the author of viii.4  mixed up both together; but we have to face the following  alternative.  Either the statement belongs to the original context  of the narrative in which it occurs, and in that case the Ohel Moed  can only be the tent on Mount Zion, or the Ohel Moed of 1Kings  viii.4 is the Mosaic tabernacle which was removed from Gibeon into  Solomon's temple, and in that case the allegation has no  connection with its context, and does not hang together with the  premisses which that furnishes; in other words, it is the  interpolation of a later hand.  The former alternative, though  possible, is improbable, for the name Ohel Moed occurs absolutely  nowhere in the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings (apart from the  interpolation in 1Samuel ii.22b), and particularly it is not used  to denote David's tent upon Mount Zion; and, moreover, that tent  had received too little of the consecration of antiquity, and  according to 2Samuel vii. was too insignificant and provisional to  be thought worthy of preservation in the temple.  But if the Ohel  Moed is here (what it everywhere else is) the tabernacle, as is  indicated also by the sacred vessels, then the verse is, as has  been said, an interpolation.  The motive for such a thing is easily  understood; the same difficulty as that with which we set out  must have made it natural for any Jew who started from the ideas  of the Pentateuch to look for the tabernacle here, and, if he did  not find it, to introduce it.  Yet even the interpolation does not  remove the difficulties. Where is the Mosaic altar of  burnt-offering?  It was quite as important and holy as the  tabernacle itself; even in Chronicles it is invariably mentioned  expressly in connection with it, and did not deserve to be  permitted to go to ruin at Gibeon, which, from another point of  view, would also have been extremely dangerous to the unity of  the sacrificial worship.  Further, if the sacred vessels were  transferred from the tabernacle to the temple, why then was it  that Solomon, according to 1Kings vii., cast a completely new  set? /1/    *************************************  1. The brazen altar cast by Solomon (1Kings viii.64;  2Kings xvi.14, 15) is not now found in the inventory of the temple  furniture in 1Kings vii.; but originally it cannot have been  absent, for it is the most important article.  It has therefore  been struck out in order to avoid collision with the brazen altar  of Moses.  The deletion is the negative counterpart to the  interpolation of the tabernacle in 1Kings viii.4.  ***************************************    The old ones were costly enough, in part even costlier than the new, and,  moreover, had been consecrated by long use.  It is clear that  in Solomon's time neither tabernacle, nor holy vessels, nor brazen altar  of Moses had any existence.    But if there was no tabernacle in the time of the last judges and  first kings, as little was it in existence during the whole of the  previous period.  This is seen from 2Samuel vii., a section with  whose historicity we have here nothing to do, but which at all  events reflects the view of a pre-exilian author.  It is there told  that David, after he had obtained rest from all his enemies,  contemplated building a worthy home for the ark, and expressed his  determination to the prophet Nathan in the words, \"I dwell in a  house of cedar, and the ark of God within curtains.\"  According to  vi.17, he can only mean the tent which he had set up, that is to  say, not the Mosaic tabernacle, which, moreover, according to the  description of Exodus xxv. seq., could not appropriately be  contrasted with a timber erection, still less be regarded as a  mean structure or unworthy of the Deity, for in point of  magnificence it at least competed with the temple of Solomon.  Nathan at first approves of the king's intention, but afterwards  discountenances it, saying that at present God does not wish to  have anything different from that which He has hitherto had.  \"I  have dwelt in no house since the day that I brought the children  of Israel out of Egypt, but have wandered about under tent and  covering.\"  Nathan also, of course, has not in his eye the Mosaic  tabernacle as the present lodging of the ark, but David's tent upon  Zion.  Now he does not say that the ark has formerly been always  in the tabernacle, and that its present harbourage is therefore in  the highest degree unlawful, but, on the contrary, that the present  state of matters is the right one,--that until now the ark has  invariably been housed under an equally simple and unpretentious  roof.  As David's tent does not date back to the Exodus, Nathan is  necessarily speaking of changing tents and dwellings; the reading  of the parallel passage in 1Chron. xvii.5, therefore, correctly  interprets the sense.  There could be no more fundamental  contradiction to the representation contained in the Pentateuch  than that embodied in these words:  the ark has not as its  correlate a single definite sacred tent of state, but is quite  indifferent to the shelter it enjoys--has frequently changed its  abode, but never had any particularly fine one.  Such has been  the state of matters since the time of Moses.    Such is the position of affairs as regards the tabernacle; if it  is determined that the age of the Priestly Code is to hang by  these threads, I have no objection.  The representation of the  tabernacle arose out of the temple of Solomon as its root, in  dependence on the sacred ark, for which there is early  testimony,  and which in the time of David, and also before it, was sheltered  by a tent.  From the temple it derives at once its inner character  and its central importance for the cultus as well as its external  form.    I.III.2. A peculiar point of view is taken up by Theodor Noldeke.  He  grants the premisses that the tabernacle is a fiction, of which the  object is to give pre-existence to the temple and to the unity of  worship, but he denies the conclusion that in that case the  Priestly Code presuppose; the unity of worship as already  existing in its day, and therefore is late, than Deuteronomy.  In his Untersuchungen zur Kritik des Alten Testaments (p. 127 seq.)  he says:--    \"A strong tendency towards unity of worship MUST have arisen as  soon as Solomon's temple was built.  Over against the splendid  sanctuary with its imageless worship at the centre of the kingdom  of Judah, the older holy places MUST ever have shrunk farther into  the background, and that not merely in the eyes of the people,  but quite specially also in those of the better classes and of  those whose spiritual advancement was greatest (compare Amos iv.  4,viii.14).  If even Hezekiah carried out the unification in Judah  with tolerable thoroughness, the effort after it MUST surely have  been of very early date; for the determination violently to  suppress old sacred usages would not have been easily made, unless  this had been long previously demanded by theory.  The priests at  Jerusalem MUST very specially at an early date have arrived at  the conception that their temple with the sacred ark and the great  altar was the one true place of worship, and an author has clothed  this very laudable effort on behalf of the purity of religion in  the form of a law, which certainly in its strictness was quite  impracticable (ILeviticus xvii.4 seq.), and which, therefore, was  modified later by the Deuteronomist with a view to practice.\"    What MUST have happened is of less consequence to know than what  actually took place.  Noldeke relies solely upon the statement of  2Kings xviii.4, 22, that Hezekiah abolished the high places and  altars of Jehovah, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, \"Before this  altar shall ye worship in Jerusalem.\"  With reference to that  statement doubts have already been raised above.  How startling  was the effect produced at a later date by the similar ordinance  of Josiah!  Is it likely then"]]]
