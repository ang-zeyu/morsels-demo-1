And so we might go wandering for ever about New London, passing on every  side the shadows of the old, but seeing little of the substance.  Book-men of the true stamp are antiquaries, to whom novelty is  abhorrent.  The pleasantest places are to them those which time has  consecrated with a gentle touch, and which reflect all their imaginings,  even as they echo their footsteps.  These are departing under the  mandate of an inexorable law, and we go with them.                                       *CHAPTER VI.*                          *VAGARIES OF BOOK-HUNTERS.*      Ten or fifteen years ago it was quite usual to meet with collections of  title-pages formed by followers of the immortal Bagford. These were to  be seen quoted in booksellers' catalogues and displayed in the auction  rooms, and were commonly disposed of for small sums of money--small,  that is to say, in comparison with what would have been realized for the  books themselves had they been allowed to remain in that state of life  to which the author and others had called them.  Of late, collections of  title-pages have not been very much in evidence anywhere, for it is  universally felt that there is little or no romance surrounding the  slaughter even of folios, to say nothing of smaller-sized victims, and  for that reason these scrappy collections are huddled out of sight like  family skeletons.  The book-hunter of the present day has his foibles,  it is true, but he has learned by experience and from the expostulatory  remarks of others that wild freaks are completely out of place in a  library, and so it has come to pass that books are treated in a  different way from what they were only a couple of decades ago, and no  one who has the smallest respect either for himself or his vocation  would now either care or dare to form a collection of title-pages.  Should he happen to own one either by purchase or under circumstances  beyond his control, he will produce it, if at all, with apologies and  sighs.  It is abundantly manifest that the wicked man hath turned away  from much of his wickedness.    The reason of this tremendous transformation must be put down to the  credit of a rule which, though formulated and preached at one time by  the elite only, has been insisted upon with such pertinacity that it has  gradually become diffused throughout the whole world of collectors, no  matter to what objects of interest they may direct their attention.  This rule is, that taste and the pocket alike demand that be a book  good, bad, or indifferent in its externals, it shall, nevertheless, be  left untouched by its owner, who is but its temporary custodian, and a  trustee for others who shall come after him.  To rip out the title-page,  no matter with what object, is an outrage on decency which, it is  pleasant to find, is now appraised at its proper pitch of enormity.  If  the stamp-collector rejoice in the possession of a specimen with  'original gum,' and rate its interest and value higher on that account,  shall the book-collector, who is the oldest, the most learned, and the  most aristocratic of all collectors, give place in the matter of  common-sense and discretion to the product of a frivolous age?  Shall he  cut initial letters from missals and other manuscripts, and insult the  shades of Fust and Schoeffer by making a senseless collection of  colophons?  These things were in vogue at one time, but are now frowned  down even by the most ignorant of mortals, since, to put the matter on  no higher ground, the money value of old books has considerably  increased of late years to his certain knowledge, and he believes that  anything with curious type, the f's made so--f, and villainous prints  scattered about the text, must _ex necessitate rei_ be worth its weight  in gold, and perhaps more.  What a contrast is this little false, but  preventative, store of knowledge to the crass stupidity of the early  years of the present century, as exemplified in the persons of the  Bishops, Canons, and Chaplains of Lincoln Cathedral, who permitted the  choir-boys to collect illuminated initials, and with that object to cut  up with their pen-knives scores of vellum manuscripts.  A good many of  the Caxtons from this same Cathedral were purchased by Dibdin for the  Althorpe collection, and will be found catalogued in 'A Lincolne  Nosegaye.'  The Dean and Chapter, knowing little about books, and caring  less, had disposed of them all for a 'consideration,' and thus without  thought stripped themselves of their choicest possessions next to the  Cathedral itself.    Of a truth, books have only recently come to be regarded as possessing a  sentimental value altogether distinct from considerations of utility,  and it is only within the compass of a comparatively few years that  collectors have sprung up from the very stones to cry aloud, and to  protest against such wanton acts of mutilation or destruction as the  records of past days almost choke themselves in the echoing of.  Only a  little while ago 'Grangerizing' was the favourite pastime of thousands  of persons of elegant leisure, as Griswold called the lazy dullards of  his generation, and what this involved would be whispered in corners but  for the fact that it was for 200 years unblushingly shouted in the open  day.    During all that period the teachings of the genuine bibliophiles had so  passed from deed and truth into mere monotony of unbelieved phrase that  no English was literal enough to convert the persons who went about  seeking material, at vast expense, wherewith to extra-illustrate some  inane book of polemics or proverbs.    Nicholas Ferrar, who kept the 'Protestant Nunnery' at Little Gidding, in  Huntingdonshire, was, I believe, the inventor of a system which was not  fully developed until the publication of Granger's 'Biographical History  of England,' but which is, nevertheless, directly or indirectly  responsible for the condition of most of the imperfect volumes which are  met with at every turn. The story of Nicholas Ferrar, assuming it to be  true, which there is little reason to doubt, makes it clear that King  Charles I. was as bad as or worse than anybody in this matter, for, had  he not affected to admire the handiwork of this first and chief of  sinners, the baneful practice of mutilating books for the sake of their  illustrations, title-pages, or frontispieces, might never have become an  aristocratic amusement, sanctified by tradition, and ennobled far beyond  its deserts by kingly patronage.  The Concordance which Ferrar showed  the King escaped the wrath of the fanatic Hugh Peters and his crew, and,  after many vicissitudes, is now safely lodged in the British Museum, a  warning to all who may at any time seek to revive a practice which  would, in these days of emulation and competition, burn with a white  heat.    In Wordsworth's 'Ecclesiastical Biography' the story of Nicholas Ferrar  is set out at length. There is no need to enter into minute details, as  the tale has since become stereotyped, and is found reproduced in a  dozen different places at least.  Shortly, it appears that in June,  1634, King Charles I. was staying with the Earl of Westmorland at  Apethorpe, and from thence sent one of his gentlemen to the home of  Nicholas Ferrar, hard by, to 'intreat' a sight of a Concordance which he  had heard had recently been completed.  When Ferrar was on the Continent  some time previously, he had bought up a great number of prints by the  best masters, illustrative of historical passages of the Old and New  Testaments, and these he afterwards used for ornamenting various  compilations of the Scriptures, among them a 'full harmony or  concordance of the four Evangelists, adorned with many beautiful  pictures, which required more than a year for the composition, and was  divided into 150 heads or chapters.'    This was the Concordance that King Charles was so anxious to look at,  and which, indeed, he admired so much that he never rested until he had  obtained one like it for his own library.  Both books are now in the  British Museum, the original having been acquired about three years ago,  and the one in the King's Library from George II., who had inherited the  royal collection of books and manuscripts.    From the point of view of Nicholas Ferrar, there was certainly no harm  in this process of extra-illustrating.  There is no reason to believe  that he had gone about tearing out plates from books, or done anything  else which in any respect, save one, could be regarded as objectionable  in the slightest degree.  There was, and is, however, one objection to  his procedure, namely, the very bad example he set to unscrupulous  people who, in after years, rose up in their thousands and commenced to  rip and tear with diabolical enterprise.  These were the days of  Granger's 'Biographical History of England'--hence the verb to  Grangerize--when people went about searching for portraits of  celebrities mentioned in the text to paste between the leaves in their  proper places.  If Granger incidentally mentioned that someone had been  conveyed to the Tower, and subsequently had the good fortune to escape  out of a certain window, books would be ransacked and mutilated to  provide illustrations of (1) the Tower of London from the N., S., E. or  W., as the case might be; (2) portrait of the prisoner; (3) view of the  window from which he let himself down; and finally, if, Laus Deo, a  letter in his handwriting or a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#14)"],[1," great  strength, and that the Dutchmen numbered some 5000. Besides these bands,  other roving commandos flitted about mosquito-wise, seeking to draw  British blood.    On the 20th Colonel Dalgety at Hibernia reported that he had been  surrounded. He stated that some 200 Dutchmen were ensconced on Doorn Kop  near his camp, and asked for help in order to effect their capture. Off  went General Rundle, with Scots Guards, Cavalry and Artillery, marching  nimbly, in the fond hope of making a \"bag,\" through the pitchy blackness  of the night, and reaching the destination at dawn. When the troops  arrived, however, it was found that Colonel Dalgety had retired, and the  Boers in dispersed gangs were again a prowling danger to the vicinity.  Meanwhile General Paget, who was holding Lindley, was attacked by De Wet,  who brought five pieces to bear on him, but the guerilla chief was  successfully repulsed by the 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, assisted later  on by a battery of the City Imperial Volunteers which gave a splendid  account of itself.    General Rundle's march was continued on the 23rd towards Senekal,  whereupon the Dutch hordes, seizing their opportunity, pounced on the  rear of the transport. Under cover of a fiercely-flaring veldt fire they  poured a volley on the rear guard--the Scots Guards and Hampshire  Yeomanry under Captain Seely--who instantly jumped to action, giving the  oncoming Boers so keen a dose from rifles and a Maxim, that they bolted  to their main position at Tafelberg. Sundry of their party, seeking  safety at the farm of some supposed neutral, were luckily captured and  their harbour of refuge razed to the ground. (It was impossible longer to  shut our eyes to the fact that the farms had become half-way houses for  rebels, and there was no other means of disposing of these death traps.)  In this engagement many of the Boers bit the dust, for the British troops  actively pursued the enemy in their flight, and succeeded in thinning  their numbers without casualties on their own side.    The dogged determination of the Boers was to break through to the south,  and it took all the ingenuity of Generals Rundle and Brabant to create a  linked chain from Winburg to the Basutoland border, through which the  slim ones could not squeeze. Owing to the nature of the country--in some  places a replica of Switzerland, with snow-capped peaks, enormous gorges,  and treacherous passes--it was difficult to assume the offensive, and Sir  Leslie Rundle had to content himself with the task of keeping the Boers  in check while help came from the north. General Clements, on the 24th,  engaged a body of fierce ruffians near Winburg, where he had gone to  gather guns and supplies prior to combining his force with those at  Lindley, Heilbron, and Heidelberg. He succeeded in driving the rebels  north of the Zand River without great loss, though Captain G. E. F.  Fitzgerald, 2nd Bedfordshire Regiment, was severely wounded, and Second  Lieutenant R. H. Lascelles, 8th Battery Royal Field Artillery, was  slightly injured.    At Bloemfontein, at this time, there was deep regret at the loss of  Captain Lord Kensington,[7] 2nd Life Guards, who had died of his wounds.    Meanwhile, near Ficksburg, on the 25th, General Boyes' Brigade also  encountered the Dutchmen. Two valuable officers were killed--Captain E.  B. Grogan and Lieutenant G. L. D. Brancker, 1st South Staffordshire  Regiment--and five men were wounded and missing.    A convoy returning with General Clements to Senekal from Winburg was also  attacked some seven miles from Senekal. Hearing of the fray, Colonel  Grenfell and his Colonials set out from Senekal, attacked the enemy's  left flank, and became so hotly engaged that General Brabant, with all  the available troops, rushed to the succour of the party. Of the combined  forces three men were killed and twenty-three wounded.    General Paget was also desperately engaged at Lindley on the 26th, when a  convoy of stores moving towards that place was attacked by the marauding  bands, but after a heavy rearguard action succeeded in getting to their  destination in safety. Ten men were killed and four officers and fifty  men wounded.    On the following day the Roodival Spruit post was attacked, but the  detachment of the Shropshire Light Infantry and West Australian Mounted  Infantry, who were there, briskly sent the enemy flying.    General Methuen, too, was not inactive. On the 28th the Boer laagers near  Vach Kop and Spitz Kop were found to be hastily removing in the direction  of Lindley, whereupon the General gave chase, pursued the enemy for  twelve miles, and eventually wrested from them some 8000 sheep and 500  head of cattle they had appropriated during their freebooting excursions  in the neighbourhood. Lieutenant G. C. W. G. Hall and Lieutenant L.  Simpson, 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, and four men were wounded, but  otherwise the operations were highly satisfactory, as the Boer larder, if  not the Boer person, had been made to pay heavily at a time when both  belligerents were none too fully fed! The enemy once hemmed in, and once  devoid of supplies, it was hoped the end of the war would be reached.    On the 2nd of July General Clements joined hands with General Paget, and  the combined force began their advance on Bethlehem, of which anon.      IN THE WESTERN TRANSVAAL. JUNE    Early in the month came a report from General Baden-Powell, from camp  forty miles west-south-west of Rustenburg, that the railway to Mafeking  had been repaired, and that over a hundred arrested rebels were awaiting  their trial. The General was working his systematic way through the  districts of Manrico, West Lichtenburg, and Rustenburg, carrying out a  mission of pacification, re-establishing order, and collecting arms and  supplies. It must be explained that in recognition of his splendid  services he had been promoted to the rank of major-general, after which  he was appointed a lieutenant-general on the staff while employed with  her Majesty's forces in South Africa. Lord Edward Cecil now filled the  post of Administrator of the Rustenburg district, and had already  accepted surrenders and collected rifles innumerable.    Rustenburg was occupied on the 14th of June by General Baden-Powell, and  a column from Pretoria was sent out to meet this officer, to repair the  telegraph between the two places, and thus provide a second line of  telegraph between the Chief and Cape Town. This, with the opening of the  railway line from Durban to Pretoria (shortly to be accomplished by Sir  Redvers Buller's operations), made important advance in the work of  occupation.    On the 18th General Baden-Powell arrived at Pretoria, where he had an  enthusiastic reception. He stayed but two days, and was off again on his  return journey towards Rustenburg. This town at the time was garrisoned  by a very small force and one gun, whose occupation it was to continue  the work of pacification, and accept the surrender of arms--most of which  appeared to be of obsolete type.    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL R. A. P. CLEMENTS, D.S.O., A.D.C.    Photo by Elliott & Fry, London]    At this date, between Rustenburg and Pretoria, a body of the enemy under  Commandant Du Plessis were roaming about, and these were met on the 19th  by Hutton's Mounted Infantry, who came out of the fray with two guns to  their credit. It was not often in the history of the war that Boer guns  were seized, and the little British force was justifiably pleased with  their prowess. There was no end to the activity of Hutton's Mounted  Infantry, and skirmishes with wandering tribes of the enemy were of  almost daily occurrence. On the 24th Captain Anley had a smart \"set-to\"  with Boer patrols south of Pretoria, in which Lieutenant Crispin and  one man of the Northumberland Fusiliers were wounded.    [Illustration: RAILWAY MAP SHOWING LINES TO W. AND S.W. OF PRETORIA.  (Scale, 1 inch=64 miles. By permission of the Publishers of \"South  Africa.\")]    About this period an informal armistice was in operation; Botha having  been given time to consider the philosophy of fighting against the  inevitable. Lord Roberts made the suggestion that the Boer commandant  should disarm his forces, and thus avert unnecessary bloodshed, but the  Dutchman doggedly refused to surrender without the consent of his  Government, and demanded further respite to obtain the same. This being  probably another ruse to enable the Dutch rebels, mercenaries, and  others--who were gathering round the standard of the commandant--to gain  breathing time, the request was refused, and hostilities were resumed. An  official warning was given to the effect that any further activities in  the form of the destruction of railway lines, &c., would be met with  prompt punishment, and involve the demolition of all farms within five  miles of the point molested. Colonel Girouard was also authorised to  compel leading residents to accompany trains--a wise precaution,  reminiscent of the policy of the East, which forces the Grand Vizier to  taste of every dish prepared for his sovereign!    When the cat is away the mice may play, and the opportunity for a game  was not lost on the Boers. During General Baden-Powell's absence from  Rustenburg a party of Dutchmen under Commandant Limmer made an effort to  lodge themselves on the heights commanding the town, and demanded its  surrender. Major Hanbury Tracy, who with 120 men was in charge of the  place, replied that he held Rustenburg for her Majesty's Government, and  intended so to do. Thereupon hostile artillery began its thunderous  detonations, and things grew frowning. But Colonel Holdsworth (7th  Hussars) from the region of Zeerust, forty-eight miles off, scenting  fight from afar, made a brilliant march, and assisted by Colonel Airey  and his mettlesome Bushmen drove back the enemy. Two Bushmen were slain,  and Captain Machattie and three men were wounded. This"]]]
