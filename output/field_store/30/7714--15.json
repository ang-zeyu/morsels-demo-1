The  _Adams_ after several changes of form finally became a flush-decked  corvette. The _Essex_ had originally mounted twenty-six long 12's  on her main-deck, and sixteen 24-pound carronades on her spar-deck;  but official wisdom changed this, giving her 46 guns, twenty-four  32-pound carronades, and two long 12's on the main-deck, and  sixteen 32-pound carronades with four long 12's on the spar-deck.  When Captain Porter had command of her he was deeply sensible of  the disadvantages of an armament which put him at the mercy of any  ordinary antagonist who could choose his distance; accordingly he  petitioned several times, but always without success, to have his  long 12's returned to him.    The American 38's were about the size of the British frigates of  the same rate, and armed almost exactly in the same way, each  having 28 long 18's on the main-deck and 20 32-pound carronades on  the spar-deck. The proper complement was 300 men, but each carried  from 30 to 80 more. [Footnote: The _Chesapeake_, by some curious  mistake, was frequently rated as a 44, and this drew in its train  a number of attendant errors. When she was captured, James says  that in one of her lockers was found a letter, dated in February,  1811, from Robert Smith, the Secretary of War, to Captain Evans,  at Boston, directing him to open houses of rendezvous for manning  the _Chesapeake_, and enumerating her crew at a total of 443.  Naturally this gave British historians the idea that such was the  ordinary complement of our 38-gun frigates. But the ordering so  large a crew was merely a mistake, as may be seen by a letter from  Captain Bainbridge to the Secretary of the Navy, which is given in  full in the \"Captains' Letters,\" vol. xxv. No. 19 (Navy Archives).  In it he mentions the extraordinary number of men ordered for the  _Chesapeake_, saying, \"There is a mistake in the crew ordered for  the _Chesapeake_, as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun  frigates, whereas the _Chesapeake_ is of the class of the _Congress_  and _Constellation_.\"]    Our three 44-gun ships were the finest frigates then afloat (although  the British possessed some as heavy, such as the _Egyptienne_, 44).  They were beautifully modelled, with very thick scantling, extremely  stout masts, and heavy cannon. Each carried on her main-deck thirty  long 24's, and on her spar-deck two long bow-chasers, and twenty  or twenty-two carronades--42-pounders on the _President_ and _United  States_, 32-pounders on the _Constitution_. Each sailed with a crew  of about 450 men--50 in excess of the regular complement. [Footnote:  The _President_ when in action with the _Endymion_ had 450 men  aboard, as sworn by Decatur; the muster-roll of the _Constitution_,  a few days before her action with the _Guerrière_ contains 464  names (including 51 marines); 8 men were absent in a prize, so she  had aboard in the action 456. Her muster-roll just before the  action with the _Cyane_ and _Levant_ shows 461 names.]    It may be as well to mention here the only other class of vessels  that we employed during the war. This was composed of the ship-sloops  built in 1813, which got to sea in 1814. They were very fine vessels,  measuring 509 tons apiece, [Footnote: The dimensions were 117 feet  11 inches upon the gun-deck, 97 feet 6 inches keel for tonnage,  measuring from one foot before the forward perpendicular and along  the base line to the front of the rabbet of the port, deducting  3/5 of the moulded breadth of the beam, which is 31 feet 6 inches;  making 509 21/95 tons. (See in Navy Archives, \"Contracts,\" vol. ii.  p. 137.)] with very thick scantling and stout masts and spars. Each  carried twenty 32-pound carronades and two long 12's with a crew  nominally of 160 men, but with usually a few supernumeraries.  [Footnote: The _Peacock_ had 166 men, as we learn from her commander  Warrington's letter of June 1st (Letter No. 140 in \"Masters'  Commandant Letters,\" 1814, vol. i). The _Frolic_ took aboard \"10  or 12 men beyond her regular complement\" (see letter of Joseph  Bainbridge, No. 51, in same vol.). Accordingly when she was  captured by the _Orpheus_, the commander of the latter, Captain  Hugh Pigot, reported the number of men aboard to be 171. The  _Wasp_ left port with 173 men, with which she fought her first  action; she had a much smaller number aboard in her second.]    The British vessels encountered were similar, but generally  inferior, to our own. The only 24-pounder frigate we encountered  was the _Endymion_ of about a fifth less force than the _President_.  Their 38-gun frigates were almost exactly like ours, but with  fewer men in crew as a rule. They were three times matched against  our 44-gun frigates, to which they were inferior about as three is  to four. Their 36-gun frigates were larger than the _Essex_, with  a more numerous crew, but the same number of guns; carrying on  the lower deck, however, long 18's instead of 32-pound carronades,--a  much more effective armament. The 32-gun frigates were smaller,  with long 12's on the main-deck. The largest sloops were also  frigate-built, carrying twenty-two 32-pound carronades on the  main-deck, and twelve lighter guns on the quarter-deck and  forecastle, with a crew of 180. The large flush-decked ship-sloops  carried 21 or 23 guns, with a crew of 140 men. But our vessels  most often came in contact with the British 18-gun brig-sloop;  this was a tubby craft, heavier than any of our brigs, being about  the size of the _Hornet_. The crew consisted of from 110 to 135 men;  ordinarily each was armed with sixteen 32-pound carronades, two  long 6's, and a shifting 12-pound carronade; often with a light  long gun as a stern-chaser, making 20 in all. The _Reindeer_ and  _Peacock_ had only 24-pound carronades; the _Epervier_ had but  eighteen guns, all carronades. [Footnote: The _Epervier_ was taken  into our service under the same name and rate. Both Preble and  Emmons describe her as of 477 tons. Warrington, her captor, however,  says: \"The surveyor of the port has just measured the _Epervier_  and reports her 467 tons.\" (In the Navy Archives, \"Masters'  Commandant Letters,\" 1814, i. No. 125.) For a full discussion of  tonnage, see Appendix, A.]    Among the stock accusations against our navy of 1812, were, and  are, statements that our vessels were rated at less than their  real force, and in particular that our large frigates were \"disguised  line-of-battle ships.\" As regards the ratings, most vessels of  that time carried more guns than they rated; the disparity was  less in the French than in either the British or American navies.  Our 38-gun frigates carried 48 guns, the exact number the British  38's possessed. The worst case of underrating in our navy was the  _Essex_, which rated 32, and carried 46 guns, so that her real was  44 per cent, in excess of her nominal force; but this was not as  bad as the British sloop _Cyane_, which was rated a 20 or 22, and  carried 34 guns, so that she had either 55 or 70 per cent, greater  real than nominal force. At the beginning of the war we owned two  18-gun ship-sloops, one mounting 18 and the other 20 guns; the  18-gun brig-sloops they captured mounted each 19 guns, so the  average was the same. Later we built sloops that rated 18 and  mounted 22 guns, but when one was captured it was also put down in  the British navy list as an 18-gun ship-sloop. During all the  combats of the war there were but four vessels that carried as  few guns as they rated. Two were British, the _Epervier_ and  _Levant_, and two American, the _Wasp_ and _Adams_. One navy was  certainly as deceptive as another, as far as underrating went.    The force of the statement that our large frigates were disguised  line-of-battle ships, of course depends entirely upon what the  words \"frigate\" and \"line-of-battle ship\" mean. When on the 10th  of August, 1653, De Ruyter saved a great convoy by beating off Sir  George Ayscough's fleet of 38 sail, the largest of the Dutch admiral's  \"33 sail of the line\" carried but 30 guns and 150 men, and his own  flag-ship but 28 guns and 134 men. [Footnote: La Vie et les Actions  Memorables du Sr. Michel de Ruyter, à Amsterdam, Chez Henry et  Theodore Boom. MDCLXXVII. The work is by Barthelemy Pielat, a  surgeon in de Ruyter's fleet, and personally present during many  of his battles. It is written in French, but is in tone more  strongly anti-French than anti-English.] The Dutch book from which  this statement is taken speaks indifferently of frigates of 18, 40,  and 58 guns. Toward the end of the eighteenth century the terms had  crystallized. Frigate then meant a so-called single-decked ship;  it in reality possessed two decks, the main- or gun-deck, and the  upper one, which had no name at all, until our sailors christened  it spar-deck. The gun-deck possessed a complete battery, and the  spar-deck an interrupted one, mounting guns on the forecastle and  quarter-deck. At that time all \"two-decked\" or \"three-decked\" (in  reality three- and four-decked) ships were liners. But in 1812  this had changed somewhat; as the various nations built more and  more powerful vessels, the lower rates of the different divisions  were dropped. Thus the British ship _Cyane_, captured by the  _Constitution_, was in reality a small frigate, with a main-deck  battery of 22 guns, and 12 guns on the spar-deck; a few years  before she would have been called a 24-gun frigate, but she then  ranked merely as a 22-gun sloop. Similarly the 50- and 64-gun ships  that had fought in the line at the Doggerbank, Camperdown, and  even at Aboukir, were now no longer deemed fit for the purpose,  and the 74 was the lowest line-of-battle ship.    The _Constitution_, _President_, and _States_ must then be compared  with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#14)"],[1," kept his money, or some little fall of that  kind--would be the making of her, and could hardly fail to render her  one of the most agreeable companions in existence. Whether they were  right or wrong in this conjecture, certain it is that minds, like  bodies, will often fall into a pimpled ill-conditioned state from  mere excess of comfort, and like them, are often successfully cured by  remedies in themselves very nauseous and unpalatable.    Mrs Varden's chief aider and abettor, and at the same time her principal  victim and object of wrath, was her single domestic servant, one Miss  Miggs; or as she was called, in conformity with those prejudices of  society which lop and top from poor hand-maidens all such genteel  excrescences--Miggs. This Miggs was a tall young lady, very much  addicted to pattens in private life; slender and shrewish, of a rather  uncomfortable figure, and though not absolutely ill-looking, of a sharp  and acid visage. As a general principle and abstract proposition, Miggs  held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and unworthy of notice;  to be fickle, false, base, sottish, inclined to perjury, and wholly  undeserving. When particularly exasperated against them (which, scandal  said, was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most) she was accustomed to  wish with great emphasis that the whole race of women could but die off,  in order that the men might be brought to know the real value of the  blessings by which they set so little store; nay, her feeling for her  order ran so high, that she sometimes declared, if she could only have  good security for a fair, round number--say ten thousand--of young  virgins following her example, she would, to spite mankind, hang, drown,  stab, or poison herself, with a joy past all expression.    It was the voice of Miggs that greeted the locksmith, when he knocked at  his own house, with a shrill cry of 'Who's there?'    'Me, girl, me,' returned Gabriel.    What, already, sir!' said Miggs, opening the door with a look of  surprise. 'We were just getting on our nightcaps to sit up,--me and  mistress. Oh, she has been SO bad!'    Miggs said this with an air of uncommon candour and concern; but the  parlour-door was standing open, and as Gabriel very well knew for whose  ears it was designed, he regarded her with anything but an approving  look as he passed in.    'Master's come home, mim,' cried Miggs, running before him into the  parlour. 'You was wrong, mim, and I was right. I thought he wouldn't  keep us up so late, two nights running, mim. Master's always considerate  so far. I'm so glad, mim, on your account. I'm a little'--here Miggs  simpered--'a little sleepy myself; I'll own it now, mim, though I said I  wasn't when you asked me. It ain't of no consequence, mim, of course.'    'You had better,' said the locksmith, who most devoutly wished that  Barnaby's raven was at Miggs's ankles, 'you had better get to bed at  once then.'    'Thanking you kindly, sir,' returned Miggs, 'I couldn't take my rest in  peace, nor fix my thoughts upon my prayers, otherways than that I knew  mistress was comfortable in her bed this night; by rights she ought to  have been there, hours ago.'    'You're talkative, mistress,' said Varden, pulling off his greatcoat,  and looking at her askew.    'Taking the hint, sir,' cried Miggs, with a flushed face, 'and thanking  you for it most kindly, I will make bold to say, that if I give offence  by having consideration for my mistress, I do not ask your pardon, but  am content to get myself into trouble and to be in suffering.'    Here Mrs Varden, who, with her countenance shrouded in a large nightcap,  had been all this time intent upon the Protestant Manual, looked round,  and acknowledged Miggs's championship by commanding her to hold her  tongue.    Every little bone in Miggs's throat and neck developed itself with a  spitefulness quite alarming, as she replied, 'Yes, mim, I will.'    'How do you find yourself now, my dear?' said the locksmith, taking a  chair near his wife (who had resumed her book), and rubbing his knees  hard as he made the inquiry.    'You're very anxious to know, an't you?' returned Mrs Varden, with  her eyes upon the print. 'You, that have not been near me all day, and  wouldn't have been if I was dying!'    'My dear Martha--' said Gabriel.    Mrs Varden turned over to the next page; then went back again to the  bottom line over leaf to be quite sure of the last words; and then went  on reading with an appearance of the deepest interest and study.    'My dear Martha,' said the locksmith, 'how can you say such things,  when you know you don't mean them? If you were dying! Why, if there was  anything serious the matter with you, Martha, shouldn't I be in constant  attendance upon you?'    'Yes!' cried Mrs Varden, bursting into tears, 'yes, you would. I don't  doubt it, Varden. Certainly you would. That's as much as to tell me that  you would be hovering round me like a vulture, waiting till the breath  was out of my body, that you might go and marry somebody else.'    Miggs groaned in sympathy--a little short groan, checked in its birth,  and changed into a cough. It seemed to say, 'I can't help it. It's wrung  from me by the dreadful brutality of that monster master.'    'But you'll break my heart one of these days,' added Mrs Varden, with  more resignation, 'and then we shall both be happy. My only desire is  to see Dolly comfortably settled, and when she is, you may settle ME as  soon as you like.'    'Ah!' cried Miggs--and coughed again.    Poor Gabriel twisted his wig about in silence for a long time, and then  said mildly, 'Has Dolly gone to bed?'    'Your master speaks to you,' said Mrs Varden, looking sternly over her  shoulder at Miss Miggs in waiting.    'No, my dear, I spoke to you,' suggested the locksmith.    'Did you hear me, Miggs?' cried the obdurate lady, stamping her foot  upon the ground. 'YOU are beginning to despise me now, are you? But this  is example!'    At this cruel rebuke, Miggs, whose tears were always ready, for large  or small parties, on the shortest notice and the most reasonable terms,  fell a crying violently; holding both her hands tight upon her heart  meanwhile, as if nothing less would prevent its splitting into small  fragments. Mrs Varden, who likewise possessed that faculty in high  perfection, wept too, against Miggs; and with such effect that Miggs  gave in after a time, and, except for an occasional sob, which seemed to  threaten some remote intention of breaking out again, left her mistress  in possession of the field. Her superiority being thoroughly asserted,  that lady soon desisted likewise, and fell into a quiet melancholy.    The relief was so great, and the fatiguing occurrences of last night so  completely overpowered the locksmith, that he nodded in his chair, and  would doubtless have slept there all night, but for the voice of Mrs  Varden, which, after a pause of some five minutes, awoke him with a  start.    'If I am ever,' said Mrs V.--not scolding, but in a sort of monotonous  remonstrance--'in spirits, if I am ever cheerful, if I am ever more than  usually disposed to be talkative and comfortable, this is the way I am  treated.'    'Such spirits as you was in too, mim, but half an hour ago!' cried  Miggs. 'I never see such company!'    'Because,' said Mrs Varden, 'because I never interfere or interrupt;  because I never question where anybody comes or goes; because my whole  mind and soul is bent on saving where I can save, and labouring in this  house;--therefore, they try me as they do.'    'Martha,' urged the locksmith, endeavouring to look as wakeful as  possible, 'what is it you complain of? I really came home with every  wish and desire to be happy. I did, indeed.'    'What do I complain of!' retorted his wife. 'Is it a chilling thing to  have one's husband sulking and falling asleep directly he comes home--to  have him freezing all one's warm-heartedness, and throwing cold water  over the fireside? Is it natural, when I know he went out upon a matter  in which I am as much interested as anybody can be, that I should wish  to know all that has happened, or that he should tell me without my  begging and praying him to do it? Is that natural, or is it not?'    'I am very sorry, Martha,' said the good-natured locksmith. 'I was  really afraid you were not disposed to talk pleasantly; I'll tell you  everything; I shall only be too glad, my dear.'    'No, Varden,' returned his wife, rising with dignity. 'I dare say--thank  you! I'm not a child to be corrected one minute and petted the next--I'm  a little too old for that, Varden. Miggs, carry the light.--YOU can be  cheerful, Miggs, at least.'    Miggs, who, to this moment, had been in the very depths of compassionate  despondency, passed instantly into the liveliest state conceivable,  and tossing her head as she glanced towards the locksmith, bore off her  mistress and the light together.    'Now, who would think,' thought Varden, shrugging his shoulders and  drawing his chair nearer to the fire, 'that that woman could ever be  pleasant and agreeable? And yet she can be. Well, well, all of us have  our faults. I'll not be hard upon hers. We have been man and wife too  long for that.'    He dozed again--not the less pleasantly, perhaps, for his hearty temper.  While his eyes were closed, the door leading to the upper stairs was  partially opened; and a head appeared, which, at sight of him, hastily  drew back again.    'I wish,' murmured Gabriel, waking at the noise, and looking round  the room, 'I wish somebody would marry Miggs. But that's impossible! I  wonder whether there's any madman alive, who would marry Miggs!'    This was such a vast speculation that he fell into a doze again, and  slept until the fire was quite burnt out. At last he roused himself; and  having double-locked the street-door according to custom, and put the  key in his pocket, went off to bed.    He had not left "]]]
