When, however, it comes to the taxation of personal property,  which means any kind of property that can be detached and carried  about, it is a different matter.    Just as many people, otherwise regarded as honest, do not think it  a great wrong to get the better of the Custom House, so many  reputable people are inclined to revolt against the tax on  personal property and to conceal their actual possessions from the  assessor, nor is this peculiarity confined to the poor.    Any man may be legally compelled to swear to the accuracy of his  statement, and if it is found that he has knowingly sworn to a  false statement, he may be brought to task for perjury.    What is known as \"personal property\" varies in many of the states.    Personal property generally includes, merchandise in possession;  all fixtures, all furniture in home, offices, and factories; all  live stock, all money on hand and in banks; other men's notes, not  transferred; all stocks and bonds and other forms of security.    TOWN TAXES    Townships or counties, if properly authorized by charter or the  votes of the people, may levy special taxes for special purposes  within the limits of their own jurisdictions, or they may in the  same way sell bonds to carry out some work that has been decided  on for the common weal.    Two or more towns, or counties, may join in the same way to carry  out a project of benefit to both, provided that the burden of the  undertaking be equitably assessed.    PAYMENTS    All tax bills are due and collectable on presentation, but this is  never enforced.    A time is, however, fixed beyond which payment cannot be deferred.    A sufficient amount of any property may be sold at auction to  satisfy a tax bill.    Of old, and still in some places, the road taxes were paid in  cash, but more frequently by work on the roads, either by the  individual man, or in connection with his team, each day's work of  one or both being fixed at a regular rate.    TAXING CORPORATIONS    The state does not tax the individual members of a corporation for  property held in common. The same result is secured better by  taxing the corporation as a body. This applies to banks,  railroads, and incorporated manufacturing establishments.    Savings banks are taxed lightly. Every depositor is liable for a  personal property tax proportioned to the amount of his credit.    To make collection easy the savings bank always pays the amount of  this tax in bulk, and then charges it to the expense account of  the establishment, so that indirectly the depositors pay after  all, as their dividends are reduced by just the amount of the tax.    TAXES IN GENERAL    When a man owns property in different towns, counties, or states,  he is regarded as so many individuals, and must pay each as the  local demands require. No matter where a man's personal property  is placed, the rule is to tax him for the whole at the place of  his usual residence.    The landlord and the merchant each pays a direct tax to the  collector, but it would be a business error to think that in so  doing either or both is carrying more than his share of the total  taxation.    The landlord keeps in mind the added expense when he comes to  adjust leases with his tenants. The merchant, who pays taxes on  his stock and so adds to his expense account, should not be blamed  if he keeps this in mind when he fixes the selling prices of his  goods.    THE RETURNS    Taxes duly paid, honestly collected, and properly expended should  never be regarded as a burden.    From no equal expenditure of money do the people get so much good.    The public schools, the public highways, the protection of life  and property, public hospitals, public libraries, residences for  the old, the blind, the orphaned and the insane, as well as secure  places for the lawless, are built and maintained by the taxpayer.    As a rule all these things are done honestly and well,  notwithstanding the outcry to the contrary.    If there be dishonesty in places, it is the fault quite as much of  the voter who selected him as of the official culprit himself.    We must take all the responsibility of our agents, whether they be  public or private.    Every good citizen should feel that his public duty is an  important private business.          CHAPTER XVIII    CONTRACTS, LEASES, AND GUARANTEES        The law books define a contract to be \"An agreement between two or  more persons to do or not to do a certain stated thing or things,  for a consideration.\"    The consideration is a vital part of every contract.    There can be no binding contract without a consideration.    The other requisites of a contract are--    1. It must be possible of accomplishment.  2. It must be in accordance with law.  3. Its performance must not injure the public.  4. The parties to a contract must be competent to do the things to  which they pledge themselves.  5. A drunken or an insane man cannot make a contract.  6. All parties to a contract must be agreed.    THE CONSIDERATION    No contract can be held as binding where the consideration is not  named.    A promise, verbal or in writing, to do something for a certain  party, cannot be enforced.    A promise to do the same thing for a stipulation named is a  contract and may be enforced.    A gift is not a form of contract. Once made it cannot be legally  taken back.    WRITTEN AND VERBAL CONTRACTS    There are certain forms of contract which cannot be legally  enforced, unless they are in writing.    1. All contracts for the sale of real estate.  2. Contracts that are not to be performed for a year or more.  3. All contracts, to answer for the debt and obligations of  another, must be in writing.    If the contracting parties put but a part of their agreement in  writing the law will recognize only the written part. The whole  must be in writing, or the agreement will not hold.    Verbal contracts are not safe.    Although the law does not require even contract to be in writing,  yet, as it never declares that a contract must be verbal, it is  the part of prudence, wherever possible, to put every contract in  writing.    Owing to defects of memory even honest men may, and frequently do,  disagree as to the terms of a verbal contract.    Because the party with whom the contract is made is a close  friend, one is apt to depend on a verbal agreement, but the closer  the friend or relative, the more reason there is for an exact  written contract, if we would keep the friend.    FORMS OF CONTRACT    The law is never specific as to the form of contract that may be  used.    It is not necessary to draw up the contract with the formal  accuracy of a real estate deed.    Any one with good sense and a fair common school education can  draw up a contract that will hold.    Know what is required, then state the facts simply.    Contracts need not be sworn to or even witnessed.    KINDS OF CONTRACT    Every note, mortgage and other form of obligation is a specific  contract.    A lease is a form of contract between two people, known as  landlord and tenant, for the use of real estate for a period and  at a rental specified in the document.    A verbal lease may be made for a short period, but if for a year  or more, it must be in writing.    A lease should state when, where and to whom the rent is to be  paid.    Each party to a lease, or other form contract should have a copy.    If the premises rented should become unusable by fire or any  action of the elements the tenant is still liable for rent, unless  there is a special clause in the lease providing for such a  contingency.    A tenant cannot, without the written consent of the landlord, use  the rented premises for any other purpose than that stated in the  lease.    AS TO REPAIRS    In some states the law compels the landlord to keep the premises  in habitable repair, but this does not seem to be the rule. It  should be decided, where there is doubt, before signing the lease.    Where it is agreed that the landlord shall keep the premises in  repair, and, after due notice of the fact, he fails to do so, the  tenant may himself make the repairs and deduct the amount from the  rent.    SUBLETTING    If there is no contract to the contrary, the tenant may sublet the  whole or any part of the premises, but this does not release him  from liability for rent.    If the tenant fails to leave the property when his lease has  expired, the owner may make his demand through what is known as a  \"notice to quit,\" which must be served on the tenant in person.    WHAT IS A GUARANTY?    A guaranty is sometimes required to insure the payment of rent.    Plainly, a guaranty is an agreement to assume, under certain  conditions, the liabilities of another.    If a man makes a contract, a lease, or a note, and his personal  resources are not deemed sufficient to secure his performance of  the things agreed to, the other may require that some one, in whom  he has more faith, shall give him a guaranty, or personal security  in writing.    The following might be used as the form for a guaranty for a  lease, contract, note or other obligation of contract:        \"For value received, I hereby guarantee    the payment of the within lease (bond or    contract).        George L. Roberts.\"      Short Hills, N. J.        October 1, 1910.    A BILL OF SALE    This is a written agreement by which one person transfers to  another his interest in certain personal property.    The law lays down no rule as to the form.    A bill of sale usually passes where the property paid for is not  immediately removed from the possession of the seller.    This form would answer in any state:          \"Bridgeport, Conn., Aug. 2, 1910.      \"I have this day sold to Calvin E. Platt,    of New Haven, in this state, my team of    bay horses, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#14)"],[1,"no one else to send. Besides, it is not our custom  to deliver goods.\"    \"Then how am I to get it home?\" asked the young gentleman.    \"I suppose you will have to carry it yourself,\" said the market man.  \"It is not heavy.\"    \"Carry it myself! Who do you think I am? Fancy me carrying a turkey  along the street!\" said the young gentleman; and he began to grow very  angry. The old man who had bought the first turkey was standing quite  near. He had heard all that was said.    \"Excuse me, sir,\" he said; \"but may I ask where you live?\"    \"I live at Number 39, Blank Street,\" answered the young gentleman;  \"and my name is Johnson.\"    \"Well, that is lucky,\" said the old man, smiling. \"I happen to be going  that way, and I will carry your turkey, if you will allow me.\"    \"Oh, certainly!\" said Mr. Johnson. \"Here it is. You may follow me.\"    When they reached Mr. Johnson's house, the old man politely handed him  the turkey and turned to go.    \"Here, my friend, what shall I pay you?\" said the young gentleman.    \"Oh, nothing, sir, nothing,\" answered the old man. \"It was no trouble  to me, and you are welcome.\"    He bowed and went on. Young Mr. Johnson looked after him and wondered.  Then he turned and walked briskly back to the market.    \"Who is that polite old gentleman who carried my turkey for me?\" he  asked of the market man.    \"That is John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States. He is one  of the greatest men in our country,\" was the answer.    The young gentleman was surprised and ashamed. \"Why did he offer to  carry my turkey?\" he asked.    \"He wished to teach you a lesson,\" answered the market man.    \"What sort of lesson?\"  \"He wished to teach you that no man should feel himself too fine to  carry his own packages.\"    \"Oh, no!\" said another man who had seen and heard it all. \"Judge  Marshall carried the turkey simply because he wished to be kind and  obliging. That is his way.\"          THE PADDLE-WHEEL BOAT        More than a hundred years ago, two boys were fishing in a small river.  They sat in a heavy flat-bottomed boat, each holding a long, crooked  rod in his hands and eagerly waiting for \"a bite.\"    When they wanted to move the boat from one place to another they had  to pole it; that is, they pushed against a long pole, the lower end  of which reached the bottom of the stream.    \"This is slow work, Robert,\" said the older of the boys as they were  poling up the river to a new fishing place. \"The old boat creeps over  the water no faster than a snail.\"    \"Yes, Christopher; and it is hard work, too,\" answered Robert. \"I think  there ought to be some better way of moving a boat.\"    \"Yes, there is a better way, and that is by rowing,\" said Christopher.  \"But we have no oars.\"    \"Well, I can make some oars,\" said Robert; \"but I think there ought  to be still another and a better way. I am going to find such a way  if I can.\" The next day Robert's aunt heard a great pounding and sawing  in her woodshed. The two boys were there, busily working with hammer  and saw. \"What are you making, Robert?\" she asked.    \"Oh, I have a plan for making a boat move without poling it or rowing  it,\" he answered.    His aunt laughed and said, \"Well, I hope that you will succeed.\"    After a great deal of tinkering and trying, they did succeed in making  two paddle wheels. They were very rough and crude, but strong and  serviceable. They fastened each of these wheels to the end of an iron  rod which they passed through the boat from side to side. The rod was  bent in the middle so that it could be turned as with a crank. When  the work was finished, the old fishing boat looked rather odd, with  a paddle wheel on each side which dipped just a few inches into the  water. The boys lost no time in trying it.    [Illustration]    \"She goes ahead all right,\" said Christopher, \"but how shall we guide  her?\"    \"Oh, I have thought of that,\" said Robert. He took something like an  oarlock from his pocket and fastened it to the stern of the boat; then  with a paddle which worked in this oarlock one of the boys could guide  the boat while the other turned the paddle wheels.    \"It is better than poling the boat,\" said Christopher.    \"It is better than rowing, too,\" said Robert. \"See how fast she goes!\"    That night when Christopher went home he had a wonderful story to tell.  \"Bob Fulton planned the whole thing,\" he said, \"and I helped him make  the paddles and put them on the boat.\"    \"I wonder why we didn't think of something like that long ago,\" said  his father. \"Almost anybody could rig up an old boat like that.\"    \"Yes, I wonder, too,\" said Christopher. \"It looks easy enough, now  that Bob has shown how it is done.\"    When Robert Fulton became a man, he did not forget his experiment with  the old fishing boat. He kept on, planning and thinking and working,  until at last he succeeded in making a boat with paddle wheels that  could be run by steam.    He is now remembered and honored as the inventor of the steamboat. He  became famous because he was always thinking and studying and working.          THE CALIPH AND THE GARDENER        There was once a caliph of Cordova whose name was Al Mansour. One day  a strange merchant came to him with some diamonds and pearls which he  had brought from beyond the sea. The caliph was so well pleased with  these jewels that he bought them and paid the merchant a large  sum of money. The merchant put the gold in a bag of purple silk which  he tied to his belt underneath his long cloak. Then he set out on foot  to walk to another city.    It was midsummer, and the day was very hot. As the merchant was walking  along, he came to a river that flowed gently between green and shady  banks.    He was hot and covered with dust. No one was near. Very few people  ever came that way. Why should he not cool himself in the refreshing  water? He took off his clothes and laid them on the bank. He put the  bag of money on top of them and then leaped into the water. How cool  and delicious it was!    Suddenly he heard a rustling noise behind him. He turned quickly and  saw an eagle rising into the air with his moneybag in its claws. No  doubt the bird had mistaken the purple silk for something good to eat.    The merchant shouted. He jumped out of the water and shouted again.  But it was no use. The great bird was high in the air and flying  towards the far-off mountains with all his money.    The poor man could do nothing but dress himself and go sorrowing on  his way.    A year passed by and then the merchant appeared once more before Al  Mansour. \"O Caliph,\" he said, \"here are a few jewels which I had  reserved as a present for my wife. But I have met with such bad luck  that I am forced to sell them. I pray that you will look at them and  take them at your own price.\"    Al Mansour noticed that the merchant was very sad and downcast. \"Why,  what has happened to you?\" he asked. \"Have you been sick?\"    Then the merchant told him how the eagle had flown away with his money.    \"Why didn't you come to us before?\" he asked. \"We might have done  something to help you. Toward what place was the eagle flying when you  last saw it?\"    \"It was flying toward the Black Mountains,\" answered the merchant.    The next morning the caliph called ten of his officers before him.  \"Ride at once to the Black Mountains,\" he said. \"Find all the old men  that live on the mountains or in the flat country around, and command  them to appear before me one week from to-day.\"    The officers did as they were bidden. On the day appointed, forty gray-  bearded, honest old men stood before the caliph. All were asked the  same question. \"Do you know of any person who was once poor but who  has lately and suddenly become well-to-do?\"    Most of the old men answered that they did not know of any such person.  A few said that there was one man in their neighborhood who seemed to  have had some sort of good luck.    This man was a gardener. A year ago he was so poor that he had scarcely  clothes for his back. His children were crying for food. But lately  everything had changed for him. Both he and his family dressed well;  they had plenty to eat; he had even bought a horse to help him carry  his produce to market.    The caliph at once gave orders for the gardener to be brought before  him the next day. He also ordered that the merchant should come at the  same time.    Before noon the next day the gardener was admitted to the palace. As  soon as he entered the hall the caliph went to meet him. \"Good friend,\"  he said, \"if you should find something that we have lost, what would  you do with it?\"    [Illustration]    The gardener put his hand under his cloak and drew out the very bag  that the merchant had lost.    \"Here it is, my lord,\" he said.    At sight of his lost treasure, the merchant began to dance and shout  for joy.    \"Tell us,\" said Al Mansour to the gardener, \"tell us how you came to  find that bag.\"    The gardener answered: \"A year ago, as I was spading in my garden, I  saw something fall at the foot of a palm tree. I ran to pick it up and  was surprised to find that it was a bag full of bright gold pieces.  I said to myself, 'This money must belong to our master, Al Mansour.  Some large bird has stolen it from his palace.'\"    \"Well, then,\" said the caliph, \"why did you not return it to us at  once?\" \"It was this way,\" said the gardener: \"I looked at the gold  pieces, and then thought of my own great necessities. My wife and  children were suffering from the want of food and clothing. I had no  shoes for my feet, no coat for my back. So I said to myself, 'My lord  Al Mansour is famous for his kindness to the poor. He will not care.'  So I took ten gold pieces from the many that were in the bag.    \"I meant only to borrow them. And I put the bag in a safe place, saying  that as soon as I could replace the ten pieces, I would return all to  my lord Al Mansour. With much hard labor and careful"]]]
