It was the first  Christmas since they had entered High School that she had not been with  them, and they were looking forward with great eagerness to her return  in February.    Julia Crosby, who was at Smith College, had accepted an invitation from  her roommate to spend the holidays in Boston, much to Grace's  disappointment, who had reckoned on Julia as one of the judge's house  party.    New Year's Day the Phi Sigma Tau nobly lived up to their reputation as  entertainers of those girls who they had originally pledged themselves  to look out for, but New Year's Night the four girl chums had reserved  for a special gathering which included the \"eight originals\" only. It  was Miriam who had made this possible by inviting Eva Allen, James  Gardiner, Arnold Evans, Marian Barber, and much against her will, Henry  Hammond, to a dinner.    \"Don't feel slighted at being left off my dinner list,\" she said to  Grace, then added slyly, \"Why don't the eight originals hold forth at  Nora's?\"    \"You're a positive dear, Miriam,\" Grace replied. \"We have been wanting  to have an old-time frolic, but didn't wish to seem selfish and  clannish.\"    \"Opportunity is knocking at your gate, get busy,\" was Miriam's advice,  which Grace was not slow to follow.    \"At last there are signs of that spread that I was promised at the  bazaar,\" proclaimed Hippy Wingate cheerfully, as attired in a long  gingham apron belonging to Nora's elder sister, he energetically stirred  fudge in a chafing dish and insisted every other minute that Nora should  try it to see if it were done.    \"You'll have to stir it a lot, yet,\" Nora informed him.    \"But I'm so tired,\" protested Hippy. \"I think Tom or Reddy might change  jobs with me.\"    \"Not so you could notice it,\" was the united reply from these two young  men who sat with a basket of English walnuts between them and did great  execution with nut crackers, while Anne and David separated the kernels  from their shells.    The eight originals had repaired to the O'Malley kitchen immediately  after their arrival, and were deep in the preparation of the spread,  long deferred.    Grace stood by the gas range watching the chocolate she was making,  while Nora and Jessica sat at a table making tiny sandwiches of white  and brown bread with fancy fillings.    \"This spread will taste much better because we've all had a hand in it,\"  remarked David, as he handed Nora a dish of nut kernels, which she  dropped into the mixture over which Hippy labored.    \"I never fully realized my own cleverness until to-night,\" said Hippy  modestly. \"My powers as a fudge maker are simply marvelous.\"    \"Humph!\" jeered David, \"you haven't done anything except stir it, and  you tried to quit doing that.\"    \"But no one paid any attention to my complaints, so I turned out  successfully without aid,\" retorted Hippy, waving his spoon in triumph.    \"Stop talking,\" ordered Nora, \"and pour that fudge into this pan before  it hardens.\"    \"At your service,\" said Hippy, with a flourish of the chafing dish that  almost resulted in sending its contents to the floor, and elicited  Nora's stern disapproval.    \"How fast the time has gone,\" remarked David to Anne. \"Just to think  that it's back to the college for us to-morrow.\"    \"It will seem a long time until Easter,\" replied Anne rather sadly.    \"And still longer to us,\" was David's answer.    \"Oh, I don't know about that,\" put in Grace, who had heard the  conversation. \"I think it is always more lonely for those who are left  behind. Oakdale will seem awfully dull and sleepy. We can't play  basketball any more this year on account of the loss of the gym., and we  seniors are going to give a concert instead of a play. So there are no  exciting prospects ahead. There will be no class dances as we have no  place to dance, unless we hire a hall, and we never have money enough  for that.\"    \"How about the five hundred dollars the judge sent?\" asked Reddy.    \"Oh, we have decided not to touch that. The money we take in at the  concert will be added to it,\" said Nora. \"That will be two  entertainments for the seniors, and we think that is enough. We want the  other classes to have a chance to make some money, too.\"    \"If we only had the bazaar money that was stolen,\" said Anne  regretfully.    \"Strange that no trace of the thief was ever found,\" remarked David. \"I  know that my wrist was lame for a week from the twist that rascal gave  it.\"    \"I have always had a curious conviction that the man who took that money  had been traveling around in the hall all evening,\" said Anne  thoughtfully. \"Whoever it was, he must have seen Grace deposit the money  in the box, and he also knew the exact location of the switch.\"    \"One would imagine the box too heavy to have been spirited away so  easily,\" said Tom Gray. \"The weight of all that silver must have been  considerable.\"    \"Yes, it did weigh heavily,\" replied Grace. \"Still, we had a great many  bills, too. In spite of the weight the thief did make a successful get  away, and we owe Judge Putnam a heavy debt of gratitude for making good  our loss.\"    \"'Look not mournfully into the past,'\" quoted Hippy, \"but rather turn  your attention to the important matter of refreshing the inner man.\"    \"You fixed your attention on that matter years ago, Hippopotamus,\" said  Reddy, \"and since then you've never turned it in any other direction.\"    \"Which proves me to be a person of excellent judgment and unqualified  good taste,\" answered Hippy with a broad grin.    \"More taste than judgment, I should say,\" remarked David.    \"This conversation is becoming too personal,\" complained Hippy. \"Excuse  me, Nora, use that Irish wit of yours and lay these slanderers low.\"    \"I am neither a life preserver nor a repairer of reputations,\" replied  Nora cruelly. \"Fight your own battles.\"    \"All right, here goes,\" said Hippy. \"Now Reddy Brooks and David Nesbit,  I said, that what you said, and formerly have said to have said, was  said, because you happened to have said something that I formerly was  said to have said that never should have been said. What I really  said--\"    But what Hippy really did say was never revealed, for David and Reddy  laid violent hands upon their garrulous friend and, escorting him to the  kitchen door, shoved him outside and calmly locking the door, left him  to meditate in the back yard, until Nora suddenly remembering that she  had set the fudge on the steps to cool, opened the door in a hurry to  find Hippy seated upon the lower step, a piece of fudge in either hand,  looking the picture of content.    [Illustration: Hippy Sat With A Piece of Fudge in Either Hand]    The party broke up at eleven o'clock, and the hard task of saying  good-bye began. The boys were to leave early the next morning, so the  girls would not see them again until Easter.    \"Don't forget to write,\" called Nora after Hippy, as he hurried down the  steps after the others, who had reached the gate.    \"You'll hear from me as soon as we hit the knowledge shop,\" was the  reassuring answer.    At the corner the little party separated, Hippy, Reddy and Jessica going  in one direction, Anne and David in another, leaving Tom and Grace to  pursue their homeward way alone. As they turned into Putnam Square,  Grace gave a little exclamation, and seizing Tom by the arm, drew him  behind a statue of Israel Putnam at the entrance of the square.    \"Marian Barber is coming this way with that horrid Henry Hammond,\" she  whispered. \"I don't care to meet them. I have not spoken to him since  the house party, and Marian will be so angry if I cut him deliberately  when he is with her. I am sure they have not seen us. They were invited  to Miriam's to-night. We'll stand here until they pass.\"    The two young people stood in the shadow quietly waiting, unseen by the  approaching couple, who were completely absorbed in conversation.    \"I tell you I can't do it,\" Grace heard Marian say impatiently. \"It  doesn't belong to me, and I have no right to touch it.\"    Hammond's reply was inaudible, but it was evident that Marian's remark  had angered him, for he grasped her by the arm so savagely that she  cried out: \"Don't hold my arm so tightly, Henry, you are hurting me. I  am not foolish to refuse to give it to you. Suppose you should lose it  all--\"    They had passed the statue by this time, and Grace and Tom heard no more  of their conversation. There was a brief silence between them, then  Grace spoke.    \"Tom, what do you suppose that means?\"    \"I don't know, Grace,\" was the answer. \"It didn't sound very promising.\"    \"I should say not,\" said Grace decidedly. \"I feel sure that Henry  Hammond is a thoroughly unscrupulous person, and I shall not rest until  I find out what the conversation we overheard leads to.\"    \"I believe you are right,\" said Tom, \"and I'm only sorry I can't be here  to help ferret the thing out.\"    \"I'll write and keep you posted as to my progress,\" promised Grace, as  she said good-bye to Tom at the Harlowe's door, a little later.    \"Good-bye, Tom. Best wishes to Arnold. I'm sorry I didn't see him  again.\"    \"Good-night, Grace, and good-bye,\" said Tom, and with a hearty handshake  they parted.    As Grace prepared for bed that night she turned Marian's words over and  over in her mind, but could arrive at no logical conclusion, and finally  dropped to sleep with the riddle still unsolved.          CHAPTER XIV    GRACE AND ANNE PLAN A STUDY CAMPAIGN      With the delights of the past holiday season still fresh in their  memories, the pupils of Oakdale High School went back to their studies  on the fourth of January, and in the course of a few days everything was  again in smooth running order.    Semi-annual examinations were but three weeks away, and that meant a  general brushing up in studies on the part of every pupil.

[_He puts the drinking-horn to his lips and takes          a long draught; then he hands it back to Gutrune,          who, ashamed and confused, casts down her eyes.          Siegfried gazes at her with sudden passion._    SIEGFRIED        O thou who dost scorch      And blind with thine eyes,  Why sink them abashed by my gaze?            [_Gutrune, blushing, looks up at him._        O lovely maid,      Lower thine eyes;      My heart is aflame,      Burnt by their light;  They kindle my blood; it flows  In devouring torrents of fire.            [_With a trembling voice._    Gunther, what name is thy sister's?    GUNTHER        Gutrune.    SIEGFRIED [_Softly._        Can those be good runes  That in her eyes I am reading?            [_He ardently seizes Gutrune's hand._    With thy brother I was fain to serve;  His pride my prayer scorned.  Were I to pray the same of thee,  Wouldst thou like him be proud?            [_Gutrune involuntarily meets Hagen's eye. She bows          her head humbly, and, expressing her feeling of          unworthiness with a gesture, leaves the hall with          faltering steps._    SIEGFRIED            [_Attentively watched by Hagen and Gunther, gazes          after Gutrune as if entranced._    Gunther, hast thou a wife?    GUNTHER        I am not wed,      Nor, it would seem,  Likely to find a wife!  My heart on one I have set  Whom there is no way to win.    SIEGFRIED            [_Turns with animation to Gunther._        In what canst thou fail      With me for friend?    GUNTHER    On rocky heights her home;  Surrounded by fire her hall;    SIEGFRIED            [_Interrupting in wondering haste._    \"On rocky heights her home;  Surrounded by fire her hall\"...?    GUNTHER    He only who braves the fire...    SIEGFRIED            [_As if making an intense effort to remember          something._    \"He only who braves the fire\"...?      [Illustration: Siegfried hands the drinking-horn back to Gutrune, and  gazes at her with sudden passion--See p. 119]      GUNTHER    May Brünnhilde's wooer be.            [_Siegfried shows by a gesture that at the mention          of Brünnhilde's name all remembrance of her has          faded._    I dare not essay the dread mountain;  The flames would not fall for me.    SIEGFRIED            [_Awakes from his dreamy state, and turns to          Gunther high-spirited and gay._    For thee I will win her,  Of fire I have no fear;      For thy man am I,      And my strength is thine,  If Gutrun' I win as my wife.    GUNTHER    Gutrune gladly I grant thee    SIEGFRIED    Thou shalt have Brünnhilde then.    GUNTHER    But how wilt deceive her?    SIEGFRIED    I will wear the Tarnhelm  And appear in thy form.    GUNTHER    Then let the oath now be sworn!    SIEGFRIED        Blood-brotherhood      Sworn be by oath!            [_Hagen fills a drinking-horn with fresh wine; he          holds it out to Siegfried and Gunther, who cut          their arms with their swords and hold them for a          short pace over the horn; then they each lay two          fingers on the horn, which Hagen continues to hold          between them._    SIEGFRIED and GUNTHER        Quickening blood      Of blossoming life  Lo! I drop in the horn!      Bravely mixed      In brotherly love,  Bloom our blood in the draught!  Troth I drink to the friend      Glad and free      To-day from the bond  Blood-brotherhood spring!  But if broken the bond,  Or if faithless the friend,      What in drops to-day      We drink kindly  In torrents wildly shall flow,  Paying treachery's wage.  So--sealed be the bond!  So--pledged be my faith!            [_Gunther drinks and hands the horn to Siegfried,          who finishes the draught, and holds out the empty          horn to Hagen. Hagen breaks the horn in two with          his sword. Gunther and Siegfried join hands._    SIEGFRIED            [_Observes Hagen, who, while the oat was being          sworn, has stood behind him._    Why hast not thou plighted thy troth?    HAGEN    My blood had soured the good draught.      It flows not pure      And noble like yours;      Stubborn and cold,      Slow it runs,  My cheek refusing to redden.      I hold aloof      From hot-blooded bonds.    GUNTHER [_To Siegfried._    Heed not him and his spleen.    SIEGFRIED            [_Puts on his shield again._        Up, then, and off!      Back to the boat!  Sail swift to the mountain!            [_He steps nearer to Gunther and points at him._        By the bank one night      On board thou shalt tarry,  And then bring home the bride.            [_He turns to go, and beckons Gunther to follow          him._    GUNTHER    Wilt thou not rest awhile?    SIEGFRIED    I am eager to be back.            [_He goes to the shore to unmoor the boat._    GUNTHER    Thou, Hagen, keep guard o'er the homestead.            [_He follows Siegfried to the shore. Whilst          Siegfried and Gunther, after laying their arms          in the boat, are hoisting the sail and making          ready for departure, Hagen takes up his spear and          shield. Gutrune appears at the door of her chamber          just as Siegfried is pushing off the boat, which          immediately glides into the middle of the stream._    GUTRUNE    So swiftly whither haste they?    HAGEN            [_While he seats himself comfortably with shield          and spear in front of the hall._    To woo Brünnhild' for bride.    GUTRUNE    Siegfried?    Hagen        See how he hastes,  For wife seeking to win thee!    GUTRUNE    Siegfried--mine?            [_She returns to her room greatly excited.          Siegfried has seized an oar and rows the boat          down-stream, so that it is soon lost to view._    HAGEN            [_Sits motionless, his back against the door-post          of the hall._        On guard here I sit      Watching the house,  Warding the hall from the foe:      Gibich's son      Is sped by the wind,  And sails away for a wife;      A hero bold      Of the helm has charge,  And danger braves for his sake;      His bride once loved      He brings to the Rhine;  With her he brings me--the ring.      O merry comrades,      Freeborn and honoured,  Gaily speed on in your pride!      Base though ye deem him,      The Niblung's son  Shall yet be your lord.            [_A curtain which frames the front of the hall is          drawn, and cuts the stage off from the audience._    [Illustration]    _The curtain is raised again. The rocky height as in the Prelude.  Brünnhilde sits at the entrance to the cave in silent contemplation of  Siegfried's ring. Moved by blissful memories, she covers the ring with  kisses. Distant thunder is heard; she looks up and listens. She turns  to the ring again. A flash of lightning. Again she listens, and looks  into the distance, whence a dark thunder-cloud is approaching the rock._    BRÜNNHILDE    On my ear from afar  Falls an old sound familiar.      A horse comes flying      Swift through the air;      On the clouds it sweeps      In storm to the rock.  Who seeks the lonely one here?    WALTRAUTE'S voice [_From the distance._        Brünnhilde, sister,      Wake if thou sleepest!    [Illustration: Brünnhilde kisses the ring that Siegfried has left with  her See p. 124]      BRÜNNHILDE [_Starts from her seat._        Waltraute's call!      How welcome the sound!            [_Calling to the wing, and then hastening to the          edge of the rock._        Dost thou, sister,      Boldly swinging come this way?      In the wood--      Still dear to thee--      Halt and dismount,  And leave thy courser to rest.            [_She runs into the wood, from which a loud sound          like a thunder-clap is heard. She returns in great          agitation with Waltraute, and remains joyfully          excited without noticing the latter's anxious fear._        Art thou so bold      That thou art come      Brünnhild' to greet,  Thy love unconquered by dread?    WALTRAUTE        Thou alone      Art cause of my haste!    WALTRAUTE    For Brünnhild's sake War-father's ban  Hast thou thus bravely broken?      Or perchance--O say!--            [_With some hesitation._        Has he at last  Softened to his child?      When against the God      I sought to shield Siegmund,      Vainly--I know it--  My deed fulfilled his desire.      And I know that his anger      Was assuaged,  For albeit in slumber deep  Here to the rock I was bound,  Doomed to be thrall to the man  Who should wake the maid as he passed,      To my anguished prayer      He granted grace;      With ravening fire      He surrounded the rock,  To bar to all cowards the road.      Bane and chastisement      Turned so to blessing;      A hero unmatched      Has won me as wife;      Blest by his love,  In light and laughter I live.            [_She embraces Waltraute with wild manifestations          of joy, which the latter tries with anxious          impatience to repress._    Hast thou been lured by my lot,      And wouldst thou, sister,      Feast on my gladness,  Sharing in my delight?    WALTRAUTE [_Vehemently._        Sharing the frenzy  That has maddened thee, fool!  Far other the cause why I come,  Defying Wotan in fear.    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Here, for the first time, notices with surprise          Waltraute's wildly excited state._        Art afraid?      Anguished with terror?  So the stern one does not forgive?  Thou fearest his punishing wrath?    WALTRAUTE [_Gloomily._        Might I but fear it,  At an end were my distress.    BRÜNNHILDE    I am perplexed and amazed.    WALTRAUTE        Calm thou thy frenzy;  Mark with care what I say!      The fear that drove me      Hither to thee  Drives me back to Walhall again.    BRÜNNHILDE [_Alarmed._    What ails, then, the Gods everlasting?    WALTRAUTE    Give earnest heed to what I tell thee!  Since from thee Wotan parted,      No more"]]]
