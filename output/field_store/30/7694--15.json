The distribution of the disease in the herd following the  introduction of a cow, sow, or ewe that has aborted before or after being  purchased, takes place through contact of the other animals with the virus  that may be present on the floor, or in the manure, or by taking the virus  into the digestive tract along with the feed and drinking water.  Experimental evidence indicates the latter avenue of infection.    The stallion is the most common source of infectious abortion in mares. An  infected stallion may distribute the disease to a large percentage of the  mares that he serves. For this reason nearly all of the mares in a certain  locality may abort.    In case the infection occurs at the time of service, the abortion usually  takes place during the first half of the period of pregnancy. Cows that  become pregnant without recovering from the inflammation of the lining  membrane of the genital tract, may abort at a very early period. McFadyean  and Stockman from the artificially inoculated cases of infectious abortion  in cows, showed that the period of incubation averaged 126 days.    _The symptoms of accidental abortion_ are extremely variable. Animals that  abort during the early periods of pregnancy may show so little disturbance,  that the animal can be treated as if nothing had happened. During the  latter half of pregnancy, and especially when the accident is caused by an  injury, the symptoms are more serious. Loss of appetite, dulness,  restlessness, abdominal pain and haemorrhage are the symptoms commonly  noted. If the foetus is dead, it may be necessary to assist the animal in  expelling it. In the latter case, death of the mother may occur.    A slight falling of the flanks, swelling of the lips of the vulva and a  retention of the fetal membranes, or discharge from the vulva may be the  only symptoms noted at the time abortion occurs.    _The symptoms of infectious abortion_ vary in the different periods of  pregnancy. At an early period, the foetus may be passed with so little  evidence of labor that the animal pays little attention to it. The  recurrence of heat may be the first intimation of the abortion. All cases  of abortion are followed by more or less discharge from the vulva. This is  especially true if the fetal membranes are retained. In such cases, the  discharge has a very disagreeable odor. In most cases the foetus is dead.  When born alive, it is weak and puny, and usually dies or is destroyed  within a few days. When the attendant fails to give the animal the  necessary attention, or is careless in his manipulation of the parts,  inflammation of the womb, caused by the decomposition of the retained  membranes, or the introduction of irritating germs on the ropes,  instruments and hands, may occur. Death commonly follows this complication.    It is very important that the infectious form be diagnosed early in the  outbreak. For all practical purposes we are justified in diagnosing  infectious abortion, if several animals in the herd abort, especially if it  follows the introduction of new animals. Methods of serum diagnosis, the  agglutination and complement-fixation tests, are now used in the diagnosis  of this disease.    _The preventive treatment_ of the accidental form consists in avoiding  conditions that may result in this accident. Pregnant animals should not be  exposed to injuries from other animals or from the surroundings. Animals  which show a predisposition to abort should not be bred. We should see that  all animals receive the necessary exercise and a proper ration.    If the animal indicates by her actions that abortion may take place, we  should give her comfortable, quiet quarters. It is very necessary to keep  her quiet, and if restless, morphine may be given. A very light diet should  be fed and constipation prevented by administering a laxative. The  necessary attention should be given in case abortion occurs.    The enforcement of _preventive_ or _quarantine measures_ is very important  in the control of infectious abortion. This is especially true of breeding  herds and dairy cows. Breeders do not recognize the importance of keeping  their herds clean or free from disease. It is a well-known fact among  stockmen that abortion and other infectious diseases have been frequently  introduced into the herd through the purchase of one or more breeding  animals. Because of the prevalence of infectious abortion among cows, it is  advisable to subject newly purchased breeding animals, or a cow that has  been bred outside of the herd, to a short quarantine period before allowing  them to mix with the herd. The breeding of cows from neighboring herds to  the herd bull is not a safe practice. In communities where there are  outbreaks of this disease, animals that abort, or show indications of  aborting, should be quarantined for a period of from two to three months.  The separation from the herd should be so complete as to eliminate any  danger of carrying the disease to the healthy animals on the clothing and  farm tools. If this method of control were practised at the very beginning  of the outbreaks, the disease could be checked in the large majority of  herds.    The foetus and membranes should be destroyed by burning. In case the animal  does not pass the fetal membranes, they should be completely removed. In  the cow, it is advisable to wait twenty-four hours before doing this. The  animal's stall should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. It is very  advisable to give the entire stable a thorough disinfecting. For this  purpose a three or four per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compound  may be used. It is advisable to apply it with a spray pump. The floor and  feed troughs should be sprinkled daily with the disinfectant. All manure  should be removed to a place where the animals can not come in contact with  it. It is not advisable to confine the cows to a small yard. The more range  they have the easier it is to control the disease.    _Individual treatment_ is very necessary. In infectious abortion the mucous  lining of the womb and the passages leading to it become inflamed. This  should be treated by irrigating the parts with a warm water solution of a  disinfectant that is non-irritating. This treatment should be repeated  daily for a period of from two to four weeks. We must be very careful not  to irritate the parts. A one-half per cent water solution of liquor  cresolis compound may be used.    Animals that abort should not be bred until they have completely recovered.  Small animals that have no special value as breeding animals should be  marketed. Cows and mares should not be bred for a period of at least three  months.    Infected males should not be used for service. The male should receive the  necessary attention in the way of irrigating the sheath before and after  each service.    PHYSIOLOGY OF PARTURITION.--Parturition or birth, when occurring in the  mare, is designated as foaling; in the cow, calving; in the sheep, lambing;  and in the sow, farrowing. A normal or natural birth occurs when no  complications are present and the mother needs no assistance. When the act  is complicated and prolonged, it is termed abnormal birth. The length of  time required for different individuals of the same species to give birth  to their young varies widely. It may require but a few minutes, or be  prolonged for a day or more. The cause of this variation in the length of  time required for different animals to bring forth their young, can be  better understood if we study the anatomy of the parts and their functions.    Throughout the pregnant period the _expulsion of the foetus_ is being  prepared for. As the foetus develops there is a corresponding development  of the muscular wall of the womb. The last period of pregnancy is  characterized by the relaxation of the muscles and ligaments that form the  pelvic walls, and a relaxation and dilation of the maternal passages. In  addition, degenerative changes occur in the structures that attach the  foetus to the womb, the normal structures being gradually destroyed by a  fatty degeneration. This results in a separation between the fetal and  maternal placenta. The contents of the womb begin to affect the organ in  the same manner as a foreign body, irritating the nerve endings and  producing contractions of the muscles. These contractions of the muscles  help greatly in breaking down the attachments until finally the labor pains  begin in earnest, and the foetus is gradually forced out of the womb,  through the dilated os and into the vagina and vulva.    _A normal birth_ is possible, only when the expelling power of the womb is  able to overcome the resistance offered by the foetus and its membranes,  the pelvic walls and the vagina and vulva.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Photograph of model of uterus of cow containing a  foetus: foetus; umbilical cord; placenta; horn containing foetus; and  opposite horn. Note the difference in the development of the two horns.]    The relative size of the foetus to the inlet of the pelvic cavity and its  position are the most important factors for the veterinarian and stockman  to consider (Fig. 18). On leaving the womb, the foetus passes into the  vagina and vulva. This portion of the maternal passages is situated in the  pelvic cavity which continues the abdominal cavity posteriorly. The pelvic  walls are formed by bones and ligaments that are covered by heavy muscles.  As previously mentioned, the ligaments and muscles relax toward the end of  pregnancy in order to prepare the way for the passage of the foetus. Before  entering the pelvis it is necessary for the foetus to be forced through the  inlet to this cavity. This is the most difficult part of the birth, as the  bones that form the framework of the pelvis completely enclose the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8508"],[0,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved in 50 Arguments (#14)"],[1," the transition  state if the theory were true. We have proven elsewhere that there is  no credible evidence of links connecting man with the monkey family.  There would have been many millions. We have shown, at length, that  some of these great changes, especially the Evolution of man from the  brute, could never have occurred.  No one of these nine great advances  was ever made, but it will suffice to examine now, as examples, two  alleged great changes, reptiles into mammals, and reptiles into birds.    1. Evolutionists say that mammals are descended from some reptiles,  unknown, of course, and birds from others, also unknown. Mammals  differ from reptiles in having breasts (Latin, mammae), a four  chambered heart instead of three, a coat of hair or fur or wool, and a  womb for the young. The temperature of the blood of reptiles is as low  as 60 and even 40 degrees, since the temperature of the blood is about  the same as the environment, sometimes approaching the freezing point.  But mammals have a temperature approaching 100°. We are to believe  that one progressive branch of reptiles, which passed through the  sieve of natural selection, during the Permian Ice Age, was capable of  being adapted to the colder climate. But this mighty chasm between  reptiles and mammals was crossed unaided by any external interference,  unaided by God; then the mammals groped their way, without  intelligence or design, up to man! The difficulties are too great to  satisfy the serious student. No satisfactory explanation has been  given. No fossils, part reptile, part mammal, have been found. We  would naturally expect millions of them. Evidently none ever  existed. How could such radical changes be brought about? What caused  the development of hair, fur and wool? The change in the heart, and  the temperature, the formation of the mammae and of the womb?  There  is no evidence of such change. But it is necessary to the scheme.    2. Some reptiles became birds, they say; whether a pair for each of  the 12,000 species of birds or one pair for all, we can not learn. For  nobody knows. They would like for us to believe that these  cold-blooded reptiles with a temperature of 40 to 60 degrees became  birds with a temperature as high as 107; that wings and feathers were  developed, which must have been perfectly useless through the long  ages during which they were developing; that the wonderful  contrivances in the wings and feathers were made by senseless reptiles  that did not know what they were doing. Reptiles have a  three-chambered heart, making them cold-blooded. Birds have a  four-chambered heart, and a temperature higher than that of  man. Reptiles left their eggs to hatch in the sun.  Birds, by a fine  instinct, built their nests with care. Some reptiles have 4 feet, some  2, some none. All birds have two feet. The bird's structure is so well  suited for flight and shows the marks of design so clearly, that the  clumsy aeroplane is but a poor imitation. Yet to link the 12,000  species of birds to their unknown reptilian ancestors, they show us  two fossils of the archæopteryx, as the sum total of the evidence  showing the transition from reptiles to birds. The fossil varies  slightly but not essentially from other birds. It has a feathered  tail, some teeth and claws. It is probably not a connecting link at  all, and if it were, we would expect a million fossils of connecting  links. All these nine transmutations are devoid of a single sure  connecting link, when we would expect millions in every case. These  facts prove that evolution is a delusion and an absurdity.        18. ANCESTRAL APES AND MONKEYS      Many have taught that man was descended from an ape or  monkey. Evolutionists, ashamed of a doctrine so repugnant to all  reason and so revolting to mankind, vainly imagine they can escape the  odium of such a view, by declaring that man is not descended from an  ape or monkey, but that all the primates including all monkeys, apes,  and man, sprang from a common ancestor. Of this alleged ancestor  _not a single fossil remains_. Dr. Chapin, Social Evolution, page  39, says: \"When the doctrine of the descent of man was first advanced,  superficial and popular writers immediately jumped at the conclusion  that naturalists believed that man was descended from the  monkey. This, of course, is quite absurd, as man obviously could not  be descended from a form of life now living. The ape and the monkey  family, together with man are probably (?) descended from some  generalized ape-like form long since perished from the earth.\" Suppose  this absurd and unsupported guess to be correct.  Then the gorillas,  chimpanzees, gibbons, orang-outangs and other apes; the baboons and  other monkeys; and the lemurs and man were brothers and sisters, or  otherwise closely related, and all were descended immediately or  nearly so from a common ancestor _lower than any_. Where is the  comfort or gain? Moreover, all the members of this primate family must  have inter-breeded for ages, until, according to the theory, they  became distinct species. Therefore, the ancestors of man, for ages,  must have been descended from all these members of the primate family,  and are thus the offspring of _all_ these repulsive brutes, and  the blood of them all is in our veins! In attempting to rescue us from  the ape as our ancestor, they have shown that we are descendants of  the whole monkey family and every species of ape and of many of their  more disreputable relatives also. Great is evolution!    It certainly would be impossible for one single pair to have become  the ancestors of the human race, without mixing and interbreeding with  their kindred primates.  Where are the descendants of these mongrel  breeds, part monkey and part man? We would expect all gradations of  mixed animals from monkey to man. \"Two or three millions of years ago  an enormous family of monkeys spread over Europe, Asia and Africa.\"  All related, many our ancestors.    Why did not some other species of the primates equal or excel man or  advance part way between man and the brute? Why are they not now  becoming human? It is plain to the sincere student that the evolution  of man from the brute is only the product of the imagination of those  who wish to deny special creation and exclude God from his universe.    The slight external resemblance between man and the ape family is more  than offset by structural differences which deny kinship. Alfred  McCann in his great book \"God--or Gorilla\" says, p. 24, \"Man has 12  pairs of ribs; the gibbon and chimpanzee, 13; man has 12 dorsal  vertebrae; the chimpanzee and gorilla, 13; the gibbon, 14. The gorilla  has massive spines on the cervical vertebrae above the scapula\"; and,  like the other quadrumana (4-handed animals) has an opposable thumb on  the hind foot.  There are wide differences in the shape of the skull,  thorax, femur, and even the liver. The skeleton of the brutes is much  more massive. On the tips of the fingers and thumbs of the human hand  are lines arranged in whorls, for identification. In monkeys, the  lines are parallel on the finger tips, but whorls on the palm. Is it  possible that man and such brutes came from the same parents?        19. A STAGGERING SPECULATION      The theory that all plants and animals have descended from one  primordial germ, is staggering to the mind. If so, how was it? Did  this original germ split in two, like some disease germs, one of them  the beginning of plant life, and the other the head of all animal  life? Or, did vegetation only, grow from this first germ for ages, and  then some of it turn into species of animals? As if the guess were  worthy of attention, some are ready to assert that early vegetation  Algae turned into animals. Did plants become animals somewhere along  the way? Or did animals, somewhere along the way, turn into plants?  How long did they interbreed before the gap became too wide? Where are  the descendants of the union between plants and animals? If animals  were first developed from this first germ, what did they live on while  there was no vegetation? What folly is like the folly of the  evolutionist who claims that such weird speculation is science?    Great gaps between the principal divisions of the animal world are  fatal to this speculation, which rests upon nothing but the wish that  it were so. Links are lacking between marine and amphibian animals;  reptiles and birds; reptiles and mammals; between apes and man. Of  course, we would find fossils of millions of these links if there were  any. The missing links are necessary to the scheme. Is there one  chance in a million that evolution is a true hypothesis?        20. SEX      Can the evolutionist explain the origin of sex? Starting with one germ  or even a few germs, reproduction must have been by division for a  time. If the germ that became the head of all plant life, reproduced  by division, when did it begin to reproduce by seeds?    It is still more difficult to explain when sex life began in  animals. There could have been no sex life at first, and perhaps for  ages. They can not tell us when the animals, by chance, acquired the  wonderful adaptation of the sexual life. They have no evidence  whatever. Their guess is no better than that of others. It passes  credulity to believe that the sexual life, with all its marvelous  design, was reached by the invention of irrational animals, when man,  with all his powers of reason, invention, and discovery, is helpless  even to understand the great wisdom and power that brought it about.    Can blind chance, or aimless effort by senseless brutes, accomplish  more than the amazing design of an infinitely wise and powerful God?    How was the progeny of mammals kept alive, during the ages required  for the slow development of the mammae?        21.
