Rebecca started, but  she could not get away her hand.  The laughter outside redoubled.  Jos  continued to drink, to make love, and to sing; and, winking and waving  his glass gracefully to his audience, challenged all or any to come in  and take a share of his punch.    Mr. Osborne was just on the point of knocking down a gentleman in  top-boots, who proposed to take advantage of this invitation, and a  commotion seemed to be inevitable, when by the greatest good luck a  gentleman of the name of Dobbin, who had been walking about the  gardens, stepped up to the box.  \"Be off, you fools!\" said this  gentleman--shouldering off a great number of the crowd, who vanished  presently before his cocked hat and fierce appearance--and he entered  the box in a most agitated state.    \"Good Heavens! Dobbin, where have you been?\" Osborne said, seizing the  white cashmere shawl from his friend's arm, and huddling up Amelia in  it.--\"Make yourself useful, and take charge of Jos here, whilst I take  the ladies to the carriage.\"    Jos was for rising to interfere--but a single push from Osborne's  finger sent him puffing back into his seat again, and the lieutenant  was enabled to remove the ladies in safety.  Jos kissed his hand to  them as they retreated, and hiccupped out \"Bless you! Bless you!\" Then,  seizing Captain Dobbin's hand, and weeping in the most pitiful way, he  confided to that gentleman the secret of his loves.  He adored that  girl who had just gone out; he had broken her heart, he knew he had, by  his conduct; he would marry her next morning at St. George's, Hanover  Square; he'd knock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth: he  would, by Jove! and have him in readiness; and, acting on this hint,  Captain Dobbin shrewdly induced him to leave the gardens and hasten to  Lambeth Palace, and, when once out of the gates, easily conveyed Mr.  Jos Sedley into a hackney-coach, which deposited him safely at his  lodgings.    George Osborne conducted the girls home in safety: and when the door  was closed upon them, and as he walked across Russell Square, laughed  so as to astonish the watchman.  Amelia looked very ruefully at her  friend, as they went up stairs, and kissed her, and went to bed without  any more talking.    \"He must propose to-morrow,\" thought Rebecca.  \"He called me his soul's  darling, four times; he squeezed my hand in Amelia's presence.  He must  propose to-morrow.\" And so thought Amelia, too. And I dare say she  thought of the dress she was to wear as bridesmaid, and of the presents  which she should make to her nice little sister-in-law, and of a  subsequent ceremony in which she herself might play a principal part,  &c., and &c., and &c., and &c.    Oh, ignorant young creatures! How little do you know the effect of rack  punch! What is the rack in the punch, at night, to the rack in the head  of a morning? To this truth I can vouch as a man; there is no headache  in the world like that caused by Vauxhall punch. Through the lapse of  twenty years, I can remember the consequence of two glasses! two  wine-glasses! but two, upon the honour of a gentleman; and Joseph  Sedley, who had a liver complaint, had swallowed at least a quart of  the abominable mixture.    That next morning, which Rebecca thought was to dawn upon her fortune,  found Sedley groaning in agonies which the pen refuses to describe.  Soda-water was not invented yet.  Small beer--will it be believed!--was  the only drink with which unhappy gentlemen soothed the fever of their  previous night's potation.  With this mild beverage before him, George  Osborne found the ex-Collector of Boggley Wollah groaning on the sofa  at his lodgings.  Dobbin was already in the room, good-naturedly  tending his patient of the night before.  The two officers, looking at  the prostrate Bacchanalian, and askance at each other, exchanged the  most frightful sympathetic grins.  Even Sedley's valet, the most solemn  and correct of gentlemen, with the muteness and gravity of an  undertaker, could hardly keep his countenance in order, as he looked at  his unfortunate master.    \"Mr. Sedley was uncommon wild last night, sir,\" he whispered in  confidence to Osborne, as the latter mounted the stair.  \"He wanted to  fight the 'ackney-coachman, sir. The Capting was obliged to bring him  upstairs in his harms like a babby.\" A momentary smile flickered over  Mr. Brush's features as he spoke; instantly, however, they relapsed  into their usual unfathomable calm, as he flung open the drawing-room  door, and announced \"Mr. Hosbin.\"    \"How are you, Sedley?\" that young wag began, after surveying his  victim.  \"No bones broke? There's a hackney-coachman downstairs with a  black eye, and a tied-up head, vowing he'll have the law of you.\"    \"What do you mean--law?\" Sedley faintly asked.    \"For thrashing him last night--didn't he, Dobbin? You hit out, sir,  like Molyneux.  The watchman says he never saw a fellow go down so  straight.  Ask Dobbin.\"    \"You DID have a round with the coachman,\" Captain Dobbin said, \"and  showed plenty of fight too.\"    \"And that fellow with the white coat at Vauxhall! How Jos drove at him!  How the women screamed! By Jove, sir, it did my heart good to see you.  I thought you civilians had no pluck; but I'll never get in your way  when you are in your cups, Jos.\"    \"I believe I'm very terrible, when I'm roused,\" ejaculated Jos from the  sofa, and made a grimace so dreary and ludicrous, that the Captain's  politeness could restrain him no longer, and he and Osborne fired off a  ringing volley of laughter.    Osborne pursued his advantage pitilessly.  He thought Jos a milksop. He  had been revolving in his mind the marriage question pending between  Jos and Rebecca, and was not over well pleased that a member of a  family into which he, George Osborne, of the --th, was going to marry,  should make a mesalliance with a little nobody--a little upstart  governess.  \"You hit, you poor old fellow!\" said Osborne. \"You  terrible! Why, man, you couldn't stand--you made everybody laugh in the  Gardens, though you were crying yourself.  You were maudlin, Jos.  Don't you remember singing a song?\"    \"A what?\" Jos asked.    \"A sentimental song, and calling Rosa, Rebecca, what's her name,  Amelia's little friend--your dearest diddle-diddle-darling?\" And this  ruthless young fellow, seizing hold of Dobbin's hand, acted over the  scene, to the horror of the original performer, and in spite of  Dobbin's good-natured entreaties to him to have mercy.    \"Why should I spare him?\" Osborne said to his friend's remonstrances,  when they quitted the invalid, leaving him under the hands of Doctor  Gollop.  \"What the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing  airs, and make fools of us at Vauxhall? Who's this little schoolgirl  that is ogling and making love to him? Hang it, the family's low enough  already, without HER.  A governess is all very well, but I'd rather  have a lady for my sister-in-law. I'm a liberal man; but I've proper  pride, and know my own station: let her know hers.  And I'll take down  that great hectoring Nabob, and prevent him from being made a greater  fool than he is.  That's why I told him to look out, lest she brought  an action against him.\"    \"I suppose you know best,\" Dobbin said, though rather dubiously. \"You  always were a Tory, and your family's one of the oldest in England.  But--\"    \"Come and see the girls, and make love to Miss Sharp yourself,\" the  lieutenant here interrupted his friend; but Captain Dobbin declined to  join Osborne in his daily visit to the young ladies in Russell Square.    As George walked down Southampton Row, from Holborn, he laughed as he  saw, at the Sedley Mansion, in two different stories two heads on the  look-out.    The fact is, Miss Amelia, in the drawing-room balcony, was looking very  eagerly towards the opposite side of the Square, where Mr. Osborne  dwelt, on the watch for the lieutenant himself; and Miss Sharp, from  her little bed-room on the second floor, was in observation until Mr.  Joseph's great form should heave in sight.    \"Sister Anne is on the watch-tower,\" said he to Amelia, \"but there's  nobody coming\"; and laughing and enjoying the joke hugely, he described  in the most ludicrous terms to Miss Sedley, the dismal condition of her  brother.    \"I think it's very cruel of you to laugh, George,\" she said, looking  particularly unhappy; but George only laughed the more at her piteous  and discomfited mien, persisted in thinking the joke a most diverting  one, and when Miss Sharp came downstairs, bantered her with a great  deal of liveliness upon the effect of her charms on the fat civilian.    \"O Miss Sharp! if you could but see him this morning,\" he  said--\"moaning in his flowered dressing-gown--writhing on his sofa; if  you could but have seen him lolling out his tongue to Gollop the  apothecary.\"    \"See whom?\" said Miss Sharp.    \"Whom? O whom?  Captain Dobbin, of course, to whom we were all so  attentive, by the way, last night.\"    \"We were very unkind to him,\" Emmy said, blushing very much.  \"I--I  quite forgot him.\"    \"Of course you did,\" cried Osborne, still on the laugh.    \"One can't be ALWAYS thinking about Dobbin, you know, Amelia.  Can one,  Miss Sharp?\"    \"Except when he overset the glass of wine at dinner,\" Miss Sharp said,  with a haughty air and a toss of the head, \"I never gave the existence  of Captain Dobbin one single moment's consideration.\"    \"Very good, Miss Sharp, I'll tell him,\" Osborne said; and as he spoke  Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#14)"],[1,"bundled. The empty coach and horses was driven over at another part of  the stream. I shall never forget the jolting: the river must have been  at least a quarter of a mile wide at that reach, and over its bed of  boulders and rocks we bumped In the middle stretched a long strip of  shingle, which seemed as smooth as turf by contrast with the first  half of the river-bed. When we charged into the water again our driver  removed his pipe from his mouth, looked over his shoulder and remarked,  \"River's come down since mornin'; best tuck up your feet, marms all.\" I  can answer for this \"marm\" tucking up her feet with great agility, and  not a moment too soon either, for as a light wind was blowing, a playful  wave came rippling over and through the planked floor of the dray,  floating all the smaller parcels about. But no one could speak, we were  so jolted: it literally seemed as if our spines _must_ come through the  crown of our heads, and I expected all my teeth to tumble out.    In the midst of my fright and suffering, a laugh was jolted out of me  by the absurd behaviour of one of our fellow-passengers. He was what is  called a bush carpenter: i.e., a wandering carpenter, who travels from  station to station, doing any little odd rough jobs wanted. This man had  been working for us some time before, and had often amused me with his  quaint ways. On this occasion he was on his oppressively good behaviour,  and sat quite silent and solemn on the opposite ledge of the dray.  But when for the second time the water came swirling through our rude  conveyance with a force which threatened to upset it altogether, Dale  fumbled in his pocket, as if he were seeking for a life-belt, produced  an enormous pair of green goggle spectacles, which might have made part  of Moses Primrose's purchases at the fair, and adjusting them on his  nose as steadily as he could, said gravely, \"This must be looked to!\"  He continued to stare at the wash of water during the remainder of our  perilous and rough transit without vouchsafing any explanation of his  meaning, but after we had safely landed he replaced his spectacles,  first in their huge shagreen case, and next in his pocket, with an air  which seemed to say, \"The danger is now over: thanks to my precautions.\"    Timaru was reached very late, and the best accommodation at the inn  placed at our disposal. Still, in those distant days there was no such  thing as a private sitting room, and we had all to eat our supper in the  same rough-boarded little apartment. But in all my varied wanderings in  different parts of the world, when the accidents of travel have thrown  me for a time among the class whom we foolishly speak of as the lower  orders, I have never yet had to complain of the slightest inconvenience  or disagreeableness from my fellow-travellers. On the contrary, I have  always received the most chivalrous politeness at their hands, and have  noticed how ready they were to forego their usual tastes and habits lest  they should cause me any annoyance. I wonder whether fine gentlemen in  their splendid clubs would be quite so willing to spoil the pleasure of  their evening if any accident were to throw an unwelcome lady amongst  them? At all events, they could not be _more_ self-sacrificing than my  friends in fustian jackets have always proved themselves, and on this  particular evening the landlord of the inn was so amazed at the orders  for tea and coffee instead of the usual \"nips\" of spirits, that he was  constrained to inquire the reason. A stalwart drover who was sitting  opposite to me at the rude table, murmured from the depths of his  great beard, in an oracular whisper, \"The smell of speerits might'nt be  agreeble like to the lady.\" In vain I protested that I did not mind it  in the least; tea and coffee was the order of the evening, and solemn  silence and good behaviour. No smoking, no songs, no conviviality of  any sort. I would fain have shown my appreciation of their courtesy by  talking to them; but alas, I was one vast ache all over! Although the  road had been a dead level, sixteen hours of jolting and bumping had  reduced me to a limp, black-and-blue creature, with out a word or a  smile. Of course I retired to what was literally a pallet, and a very  hard pallet too, as early as possible, but even after I had vanished  behind the thin wooden partition which formed my bedroom, the greatest  silence and decorum continued to reign among my fellow-travellers.        Chapter VII: \"Buying a run.\"--continued.      Early the next morning we all breakfasted together, and then separated  with most polite adieux. We sallied forth to look for a couple of riding  horses. There were none to be hired, so we had to buy two good-looking  nags for 45 pounds a-piece. Now-a-days the same horses would not fetch  more than 10 pounds and I have been told that in Australia you can buy a  horse for a shilling, but ours in New Zealand have never sunk lower  than a couple of pounds, if they had any legs at all. It seemed to the  horse-dealer quite a superfluous question when I timidly inquired if my  horse had ever carried a lady. \"No: I can't just say as he has, mum, as  you see there aint no ladies in these parts for him to carry. But,\" he  added magnanimously, \"I'll try him with a blanket fust, if you're at  all oneasy about him.\" We did not start until the next day, as we had to  hunt up side-saddles, and I had to sew a few yards of grey linsey into  a riding-skirt; but by the following day we were all ready, and our  \"swags\" packed and strapped to the saddles by nine o'clock. F----'s  horse looked a very nice one in every respect; mine was evidently uneasy  in his mind at the strange shape of his saddle, and I was recommended to  mount outside the little enclosure, on a patch of open ground, where  my steed would not be able to brush me off. The moment I mounted, the  \"Hermit\" as he was called, made for a dry ditch and tried to lie down,  but a sharp cut from a stock-whip brought him out of it, and then he  laid his ears well back and started for a good gallop, to endeavour to  get rid of his strange rider. However, his head was turned in the right  direction; there were no obstacles in the way, and before he got tired  of his pace we had left Timaru a good many miles behind us. F----  looked complacently at the \"Hermit,\" and observed, \"He'll carry you very  nicely, I think.\" I could only breathe a sincere hope that he might.    It was a beautiful day, warm but not oppressive, and delightfully  calm. Our road lay at first along the sea-shore. Ever since we had left  Christchurch the ground had been almost level, and the road consisted  merely of a track cleared from tussocks. On our left extended the vast  strip known as the Ninety-miles Beach, whilst far on our right, between  us and the west coast, the Southern Alps, rose in all their might and  beauty, sometimes lightly veiled by a summer haze, at others cutting our  Italian-blue sky sharp and clear with their grand outlines. Our horses  were a trifle too fat for good condition, and we feared to hurry them  the first day, so we made an early halt at Mahiki, only a twenty  miles stage; but the next day they took us on to Waitaki Ferry, past a  splendid bush, and so into the heart of the hill country.    Between the ranges, beautiful fertile valleys extended; when I say  fertile, I mean that the soil was excellent, and the land well-grassed.  But there was no cultivation. Not a sod had ever been turned there  since the creation of the world, and the whole country wore the  peculiar yellow tinge caught from the tall waving tussocks, which is the  prevailing feature of New Zealand scenery _au naturel_. Every acre  had been \"taken up,\" but as yet the runs were rather understocked. Our  fourth day's ride was the longest,--fifty-five miles in all, though we  halted for a couple of hours at a miserable accommodation house.  Our bivouac that night was close to Lake Wanaka, at the Molyneux  Ferry-house, and there I was kept awake all night by the attentions of  a cat. I never saw such a ridiculous animal. Prince, for that was his  name, took the greatest fancy to me, or rather to my woollen skirt I  suppose, and found a linsey lap much more comfortable than the corduroy  knees on which he took his usual evening nap. At all events he followed  me into my room, which only boasted of a mattress, stuffed with  tussock-grass by the way, on the floor. Here I should have slept very  well after my long journey, if Prince would have permitted it. In vain  I put him out of the window, not always very gently; he returned in five  minutes, bringing a palpitating, just-caught bird or mouse, which he  softly dropped on my face, and purred loudly with delight at his own  gallantry. Twenty times did I strike a match that night and try to  restore the victims to life; only one recovered sufficiently to be  released, and Prince brought it in again, quite dead, five minutes  later. I shut the little casement window, but the room became so hot and  stuffy, and suspicious fumes of stale beer and tobacco began to assert  their presence, so that I found myself obliged to open it again.  Sometimes the victim's bones were crunched close to my ear, and I found  more than one feather in my hair in the morning. Never was any one so  persecuted by a cat as I was by Prince that weary night.    The next day we got to a station known as \"Johnson's.\" It was just at  the head of the lake, and as we arrived tolerably early in the forenoon  we embarked, after the usual station dinner of mutton, tea, and damper,  on Lake Wanaka. Alas for those treacherous blue waters! We had only a  little pair-oared boat, in which I took my place as coxwain, and after  pulling for a mile or two under a blazing sun, over short chopping  waves, with a head-wind, we all became so deadly sea-sick that we had to  turn back! As soon as we had rested and recovered, a"]]]
