Like him, he is represented sitting on a  hemi-cycle.    These two statues, which are companions, are admirable for the noble  simplicity of their execution. They are both of Pentelic marble, and  were found in the XVIth century at Rome, in the gardens of the  convent of _San Lorenzo_, on Mount Viminal. After making part of the  baths of Olympius, they were placed by Sixtus V. at _Negroni_, whence  they were removed to the Vatican by Pius VI.           *       *       *       *       *    Continuing our examination, after leaving the HALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS  MEN, we next come to the    HALL OF THE ROMANS.    The ceiling of this hall is ornamented with subjects taken from the  Roman history, painted by ROMANELLI; and in it are chiefly assembled  such works of sculpture as have a relation to that people.    Among several busts and statues, representing ADRIAN, PUBLIUS  CORNELIUS SCIPIO, MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, CICERO,  &c. I shall point out to your notice,      209. _The_ TORSO _of_ BELVEDERE.    This admirable remnant of a figure seated, though the head, arms, and  legs are wanting, represents the apotheosis of Hercules. The lion's  skin spread on the rock, and the enormous size of the limbs, leave no  doubt as to the subject of the statue. Notwithstanding the muscles  are strongly marked, the veins in the body of the hero are  suppressed, whence antiquaries have inferred, that the intention of  the author was to indicate the very moment of his deification.  According to this idea, our countryman FLAXMAN has immortalized  himself by restoring a copy of the _Torso_, and placing Hebe on the  left of Hercules, in the act of presenting to him the cup of  immortality.    On the rock, where the figure is seated, is the following Greek  inscription:      [Greek: APOLLONIOS]    [Greek: NESTOROS]    [Greek: ATÆNAIOS]    [Greek: EPOIEI.]    By which we are informed, that it is the production of APOLLONIUS,  _the Athenian, the son of Nestor_, who, probably, flourished in the  time of Pompey the Great.    This valuable antique is of Pentelic marble, and sculptured in a most  masterly style. It was found at Rome, near Pompey's theatre, now  _Campo di Fiore_. Julius II. placed it in the garden of the Vatican,  where it was long the object of the studies of MICHAEL ANGELO,  RAPHAEL, &c. those illustrious geniuses, to whom we are indebted for  the improvement of the fine arts. Among artists, it has always been  distinguished by the appellation of the _Torso of Belvedere_.      94. _A wounded warrior, commonly called the_ GLADIATOR MORIENS.    This figure, represents a barbarian soldier, dying on the field of  battle, without surrendering. It is remarkable for truth of  imitation, of a choice nature, though not sublime, (because the  subject would not admit of it,) and for nobleness of expression,  which is evident without affectation.    This statue formerly belonged to the _Villa-Ludovisi_, whence it was  removed to the Museum of the Capitol by Clement XII. It is from the  chisel of AGASIAS, a sculptor of Ephesus, who lived 450 years before  the Christian era.      82. CERES.    This charming figure is rather that of a Muse than of the goddess of  agriculture. It is admirable for the _ideal_ beauty of the drapery.  She is clad in a tunic; over this is thrown a mantle, the execution  of which is so perfect, that, through it, are perceived the knots of  the strings which fasten the tunic below the bosom.    It formerly belonged to the _Villa-Mattei_, on Mount Esquiline; but  was taken from the Museum of the Vatican, where it had been placed by  Clement XIV.      80. _A Roman orator, called_ GERMANICUS.    Hitherto this admirable figure of a Roman orator, with the attributes  of Mercury, the god of eloquence, has passed for that of Germanicus,  though it is manifestly too old for him. Here we have another model  of beautiful elegance of form, though not of an _ideal_ sublimity.    On the shell of a tortoise, at tide foot of the statue, is inscribed  in beautiful Greek characters:      [Greek: KLEOMENÆS]    [Greek: KLEOMENOYS]    [Greek: ATÆNIOSE]    [Greek: POIÆSEN.]    Whence we learn that it is the production of CLEOMENES, an Athenian  artist, mentioned by Pliny, and who flourished towards the end of the  Roman republic, about 500 years before Christ. This statue was taken  from the Gallery of Versailles, where it had been placed in the reign  of Lewis XIV. It formerly belonged to the garden of Sixtus V. at  _Villa-Montalto_, in Rome.      97. ANTINOÜS, _called the_ ANTINOÜS OF THE CAPITOL.    In this monument, Adrian's favourite is represented as having  scarcely attained the age of puberty. He is naked, and his attitude  has some affinity to that of Mercury. However, his countenance seems  to be impressed with that cast of melancholy, by which all his  portraits are distinguished: Hence has been applied to him that verse  of Virgil on Marcellus;      _\"Sed frons læta parum, et dejecto lumina vultu\"_    This beautiful figure, of Carrara marble, is sculptured in a masterly  manner. It comes from the Museum of the Capitol, and previously  belonged to the collection of Cardinal Alessandro Albani. The  fore-arm and left leg are modern.      200. ANTINOÜS.    In this colossal bust of the Bithynian youth, are some peculiarities  which call to mind the images of the Egyptian god _Harpocrates_. It  is finely executed in hard Greek marble, and comes from the Museum of  the Vatican. As recently as the year 1790, it was dug from the ruins  of the _Villa-Fede_ at Tivoli.    But enough for to-day--to-morrow I will resume my pen, and we will  complete our survey of the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES.        LETTER VIII.    _Paris, October 29, 1801._    If the culture of the arts, by promoting industry and increasing  commerce, improves civilization, and refines manners, what modern  people can boast of such advantages as are now enjoyed by the French  nation? While the sciences keep pace with the arts, good taste bids  fair to spread, in time, from the capital throughout the country, and  to become universal among them. In antiquity, Athens attests the  truth of this proposition, by rising, through the same means, above  all the cities of Greece; and, in modern times, have we not seen in  Florence, become opulent, the darkness of ignorance vanish, like a  fog, before the bright rays of knowledge, diffused by the flourishing  progress of the arts and sciences?    When I closed my letter yesterday, we had just terminated our  examination of the HALL OF THE ROMANS. On the same line with it, the  next apartment we reach, taking its name from the celebrated group  here placed, is styled the    HALL OF THE LAOCOON.    Here are to be admired four pillars of _verde antico_, a species of  green marble, obtained by the ancients, from the environs of  Thessalonica. They were taken from the church of _Montmorency_, where  they decorated the tomb of Anne, the constable of that name. The  first three apartments are floored with inlaid oak; but this is paved  with beautiful marble.    Of the _chefs d'oeuvre_ exhibited in this hall, every person of taste  cannot but feel particular gratification in examining the  undermentioned;      N° 108. LAOCOON.    The pathetic story which forms the subject of this admirable group is  known to every classic reader. It is considered as one of the most  perfect works that ever came from the chisel; being at once a  master-piece of composition, design, and feeling. Any sort of  commentary could but weaken the impression which it makes on the  beholder.    It was found in 1506, under the pontificate of Julius II, at Rome, on  Mount Esquiline, in the ruins of the palace of Titus. The three  Rhodian artists, AGESANDER, POLYDORUS, and ATHENOPORUS, mentioned by  Pliny, as the sculptors of this _chef d'oeuvre_ flourished during the  time of the Emperors, in the first century of the Christian era.    The group is composed of five blocks, but joined in so skilful a  manner, that Pliny thought them of one single piece. The right arm of  the father and two arms of the children are wanting.      111. AMAZON.    This uncommonly beautiful figure of Parian marble represents a woman,  whose feminine features and form seem to have contracted the  impression of the masculine habits of warfare. Clad in a very fine  tunic, which, leaving the left breast exposed, is tucked up on the  hips, she is in the act of bending a large bow. No attitude could be  better calculated for exhibiting to advantage the finely-modelled  person of this heroine.    For two centuries, this statue was at the _Villa-Mattei_, on Mount  Coelius at Rome, whence it was removed to the Museum of the Vatican  by Clement XIV.      118. MELEAGER.    The son of OEneus, king of Calydon, with nothing but a _chlamis_  fastened on his shoulders, and winding round his left arm, is here  represented resting himself, after having killed the formidable wild  boar, which was ravaging his dominions; at his side is the head of  the animal, and near him sits his faithful dog.    The beauty of this group is sublime, and yet it is of a different  cast, from either that of the _Apollo of Belvedere_, or that of the  _Mercury_, called Antinoüs, of which we shall presently have occasion  to speak.    This group is of Greek marble of a cinereous colour: there are two  different traditions respecting the place where it was found; but the  preference is given to that of Aldroandi, who affirms that it was  discovered in a vineyard bordering on the Tiber. It belonged to  Fusconi, physician to Paul III, and was for a long time in the  _Pighini_ palace at Rome, whence Clement XIV had it conveyed to the  Vatican.      103 and 104. _Two busts, called_ TRAGEDY and COMEDY.    These colossal heads of Bacchantes adorned the entrance of the  theatre of the _Villa-Adriana_ at Tivoli. Though the execution of  them is highly finished, it is no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#14)"],[1,"the lower  branches through which he was traveling an old but well-marked spoor--a  spoor that set his heart to leaping--the spoor of man, of white men,  for among the prints of naked feet were the well defined outlines of  European made boots.  The trail, which marked the passage of a  good-sized company, pointed north at right angles to the course the boy  and the ape were taking toward the coast.    Doubtless these white men knew the nearest coast settlement.  They  might even be headed for it now.  At any rate it would be worth while  overtaking them if even only for the pleasure of meeting again  creatures of his own kind.  The lad was all excitement; palpitant with  eagerness to be off in pursuit.  Akut demurred.  He wanted nothing of  men.  To him the lad was a fellow ape, for he was the son of the king  of apes.  He tried to dissuade the boy, telling him that soon they  should come upon a tribe of their own folk where some day when he was  older the boy should be king as his father had before him.  But Jack  was obdurate.  He insisted that he wanted to see white men again.  He  wanted to send a message to his parents.  Akut listened and as he  listened the intuition of the beast suggested the truth to him--the boy  was planning to return to his own kind.    The thought filled the old ape with sorrow.  He loved the boy as he had  loved the father, with the loyalty and faithfulness of a hound for its  master.  In his ape brain and his ape heart he had nursed the hope that  he and the lad would never be separated.  He saw all his fondly  cherished plans fading away, and yet he remained loyal to the lad and  to his wishes.  Though disconsolate he gave in to the boy's  determination to pursue the safari of the white men, accompanying him  upon what he believed would be their last journey together.    The spoor was but a couple of days old when the two discovered it,  which meant that the slow-moving caravan was but a few hours distant  from them whose trained and agile muscles could carry their bodies  swiftly through the branches above the tangled undergrowth which had  impeded the progress of the laden carriers of the white men.    The boy was in the lead, excitement and anticipation carrying him ahead  of his companion to whom the attainment of their goal meant only  sorrow.  And it was the boy who first saw the rear guard of the caravan  and the white men he had been so anxious to overtake.    Stumbling along the tangled trail of those ahead a dozen heavily laden  blacks who, from fatigue or sickness, had dropped behind were being  prodded by the black soldiers of the rear guard, kicked when they fell,  and then roughly jerked to their feet and hustled onward.  On either  side walked a giant white man, heavy blonde beards almost obliterating  their countenances.  The boy's lips formed a glad cry of salutation as  his eyes first discovered the whites--a cry that was never uttered, for  almost immediately he witnessed that which turned his happiness to  anger as he saw that both the white men were wielding heavy whips  brutally upon the naked backs of the poor devils staggering along  beneath loads that would have overtaxed the strength and endurance of  strong men at the beginning of a new day.    Every now and then the rear guard and the white men cast apprehensive  glances rearward as though momentarily expecting the materialization of  some long expected danger from that quarter.  The boy had paused after  his first sight of the caravan, and now was following slowly in the  wake of the sordid, brutal spectacle.  Presently Akut came up with him.  To the beast there was less of horror in the sight than to the lad, yet  even the great ape growled beneath his breath at useless torture being  inflicted upon the helpless slaves.  He looked at the boy.  Now that he  had caught up with the creatures of his own kind, why was it that he  did not rush forward and greet them?  He put the question to his  companion.    \"They are fiends,\" muttered the boy.  \"I would not travel with such as  they, for if I did I should set upon them and kill them the first time  they beat their people as they are beating them now; but,\" he added,  after a moment's thought, \"I can ask them the whereabouts of the  nearest port, and then, Akut, we can leave them.\"    The ape made no reply, and the boy swung to the ground and started at a  brisk walk toward the safari.  He was a hundred yards away, perhaps,  when one of the whites caught sight of him.  The man gave a shout of  alarm, instantly levelling his rifle upon the boy and firing.  The  bullet struck just in front of its mark, scattering turf and fallen  leaves against the lad's legs.  A second later the other white and the  black soldiers of the rear guard were firing hysterically at the boy.    Jack leaped behind a tree, unhit.  Days of panic ridden flight through  the jungle had filled Carl Jenssen and Sven Malbihn with jangling  nerves and their native boys with unreasoning terror.  Every new note  from behind sounded to their frightened ears the coming of The Sheik  and his bloodthirsty entourage.  They were in a blue funk, and the  sight of the naked white warrior stepping silently out of the jungle  through which they had just passed had been sufficient shock to let  loose in action all the pent nerve energy of Malbihn, who had been the  first to see the strange apparition.  And Malbihn's shout and shot had  set the others going.    When their nervous energy had spent itself and they came to take stock  of what they had been fighting it developed that Malbihn alone had seen  anything clearly.  Several of the blacks averred that they too had  obtained a good view of the creature but their descriptions of it  varied so greatly that Jenssen, who had seen nothing himself, was  inclined to be a trifle skeptical.  One of the blacks insisted that the  thing had been eleven feet tall, with a man's body and the head of an  elephant.  Another had seen THREE immense Arabs with huge, black  beards; but when, after conquering their nervousness, the rear guard  advanced upon the enemy's position to investigate they found nothing,  for Akut and the boy had retreated out of range of the unfriendly guns.    Jack was disheartened and sad.  He had not entirely recovered from the  depressing effect of the unfriendly reception he had received at the  hands of the blacks, and now he had found an even more hostile one  accorded him by men of his own color.    \"The lesser beasts flee from me in terror,\" he murmured, half to  himself, \"the greater beasts are ready to tear me to pieces at sight.  Black men would kill me with their spears or arrows.  And now white  men, men of my own kind, have fired upon me and driven me away.  Are  all the creatures of the world my enemies?  Has the son of Tarzan no  friend other than Akut?\"    The old ape drew closer to the boy.    \"There are the great apes,\" he said.  \"They only will be the friends of  Akut's friend.  Only the great apes will welcome the son of Tarzan.  You have seen that men want nothing of you.  Let us go now and continue  our search for the great apes--our people.\"    The language of the great apes is a combination of monosyllabic  gutturals, amplified by gestures and signs.  It may not be literally  translated into human speech; but as near as may be this is what Akut  said to the boy.    The two proceeded in silence for some time after Akut had spoken.  The  boy was immersed in deep thought--bitter thoughts in which hatred and  revenge predominated.  Finally he spoke:  \"Very well, Akut,\" he said,  \"we will find our friends, the great apes.\"    The anthropoid was overjoyed; but he gave no outward demonstration of  his pleasure.  A low grunt was his only response, and a moment later he  had leaped nimbly upon a small and unwary rodent that had been  surprised at a fatal distance from its burrow.  Tearing the unhappy  creature in two Akut handed the lion's share to the lad.          Chapter 8      A year had passed since the two Swedes had been driven in terror from  the savage country where The Sheik held sway.  Little Meriem still  played with Geeka, lavishing all her childish love upon the now almost  hopeless ruin of what had never, even in its palmiest days, possessed  even a slight degree of loveliness.  But to Meriem, Geeka was all that  was sweet and adorable.  She carried to the deaf ears of the battered  ivory head all her sorrows all her hopes and all her ambitions, for  even in the face of hopelessness, in the clutches of the dread  authority from which there was no escape, little Meriem yet cherished  hopes and ambitions.  It is true that her ambitions were rather  nebulous in form, consisting chiefly of a desire to escape with Geeka  to some remote and unknown spot where there were no Sheiks, no  Mabunus--where El Adrea could find no entrance, and where she might  play all day surrounded only by flowers and birds and the harmless  little monkeys playing in the tree tops.    The Sheik had been away for a long time, conducting a caravan of ivory,  skins, and rubber far into the north.  The interim had been one of  great peace for Meriem.  It is true that Mabunu had still been with  her, to pinch or beat her as the mood seized the villainous old hag;  but Mabunu was only one.  When The Sheik was there also there were two  of them, and The Sheik was stronger and more brutal even than Mabunu.  Little Meriem often wondered why the grim old man hated her so.  It is  true that he was cruel and unjust to all with whom he came in contact,  but to Meriem he reserved his greatest cruelties, his most studied  injustices.    Today Meriem was squatting at the foot of a large tree which grew  inside the palisade close to the edge of the village.  She was  fashioning a tent of leaves for Geeka.  Before the tent were some  pieces of wood and small leaves and a few stones.  These were the  household utensils.  Geeka was cooking dinner.  As the"]]]
