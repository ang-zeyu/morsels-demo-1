O'Neil from the workshop came on too, in that year,  became chief mechanic.    When a base was set up at Los Angeles, Lange, a New Englander who had  left Boston University to fly airships in the first war, later flying  out of Panama, joined up, was sent to California, later took charge of  the Washington base. Sewell, a Kansan with a similar record, having left  the state university to fly blimps in coastal patrol in 1918 came in,  captained a ship at New York, followed Lange at Los Angeles.    Further expansion came in 1929, when the Puritan, Mayflower, Vigilant  and Volunteer and Defender were added to the fleet. Now came Wilson,  Purdue footballer, Furculow from West Point and Mt. Union, Hobensack  from West Virginia U, Rieker and Crum from Ohio State, the last named  becoming engineer officer of the group.    Other practical men came in, from the balloon room and aero  shops--Sheppard a Virginian, who later flew all over New England, the  Middle West and Texas; Massick, Crosier and Munro; Blair, Army sergeant  from Scott Field, came to Goodyear after the semi-rigid RS-1 was  finished.    Stacy, another New Englander, left the class room at Massachusetts Tech  to sign up. Dixon, born in a lighthouse on Nantucket Island, left a  billet as junior officer on a South American liner to fly land ships  instead. Trotter, from the Naval Academy, was in engineering work in  Florida when a blimp flew over. Lueders came in via the ground crew at  Los Angeles.    Many of the Goodyear pilots were commissioned as Reserve officers in the  Navy, and Fickes, Boettner, Lange, Sewell, Wilson, Trotter and Furculow  each took a year's active duty with the Navy at Lakehurst with rigid  ships. More than a score of trips were made by Goodyear pilots across  the ocean as student officers aboard the Graf Zeppelin and the  Hindenburg, getting post-graduate training.    The breaking up of the pilot organization began as early as 1940, when  with war clouds appearing in the East, Trotter, Rieker and Furculow  volunteered for active duty with the Navy. By the middle of 1941, Stacy,  Smith, Lueders and Dixon had followed them into uniform, were flying  Navy airships at Lakehurst.    To fill their places and also furnish material for the already expanding  airship Navy, a training class of 19 men was started in late 1940 at  Akron and Los Angeles. A six-months' ground school preceded flight  training--which started with seven balloon flights.    The training course evolved there was one which grew naturally out of  such a situation. Airship piloting had changed from the \"seat of the  pants\" flying of the first war, when veteran Jack Boettner would turn  out pilots in six weeks. The ships had become more complex as  improvements were made. Helium gas was being used. Navigation by radio  and compass was quite different from the \"concrete compass flying\" of  1916, when pilots followed highways or railroad tracks to keep on  course. Instrument flying had come in, and blind flying was part of  every student's training, in a closed control car, operating by  instrument only. The modern airship pilot had to know his radio beams  and the rules of Civil Aeronautics Authority, be able to ride the beam  into the airport. In these various details the Goodyear pilots,  long-seasoned, had perfected themselves through years of operation, were  competent to pass on their secrets to the youngsters coming in.    The student pilot spent his first half dozen hours trying only to keep  the ship at constant altitude, not caring where he was going. Then he  would fly a given course, follow a zigzag rail fence, or a winding road,  not worrying about his altitude. Lesson three was to combine the two,  fly at constant altitude over a set course. And after enough hours at  this, he'd try to circle a pylon, keeping a specified distance away,  while the wind pushed the ship in one direction, then another--now  flying up wind, now down, now cross-wind, now quartering, making such  changes in course to allow for wind and drift as to maintain a perfect  circle--and trying finally to achieve the supreme art of the airshipper,  which is to get the feel of the controls and the weather so that he can  anticipate drift and sharp drops and rises, move his controls a split  second ahead of time, stay on course and altitude.    Airship students got no exemption from Civil Aeronautics Authority by  reason of the fact that blimps land more slowly than bombers, took the  same physical examination, including eyesight. The training course  worked out with the government followed closely that for  heavier-than-air pilots, with such changes only as were made necessary  by the fact that in one case a static lift was utilized chiefly, and in  the other case dynamic lift. There was plenty of need for the students  by the time they finished their training.    Over the 16 years during which the fleet operations were carried on ship  sizes settled down to 123,000 cu. ft. as a compromise between the 51,000  cu. ft. Pilgrim and the 164,000 cu. ft. Defender. This size ship could  carry six passengers with pilot and aide, was easy to handle with a  small crew, had adequate cruising radius for the job at hand.    Later ships, the Enterprise, Ranger, Resolute, Reliance and Rainbow,  carried on the tradition of honoring the defenders of America's cup in  international racing.    While an airplane can land anywhere on an open field, the airship needed  at least a minimum of terminal facilities. Many groups co-operated at  the outset. St. Petersburg, Florida built a hangar; Miami towed a  war-time Navy shed up from Key West; Col. E. H. R. Green built one on  his New Bedford estate for use in connection with radio studies being  made by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company built its own  at Gadsden, Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and New York, calling them  air docks rather than hangars.    Unused Army and Navy hangars were borrowed in the early years at  Aberdeen, Md., and briefly at Cape May, N. J., Pensacola, Arcadia, Cal.  and Chatham, Mass., with Lakehurst, Langley Field, Scott Field and  Sunnyvale, Cal., handy as ports of call.    More and more, however, the fleet grew independent of ground aid, became  increasingly self-reliant through the use of its masting equipment.    The Goodyear fleet wrote a remarkable safety record in the 16 years.  Accidents to airship personnel could be counted on the fingers of one  hand, and in the case of the public, 400,000 passengers had been carried  up to 1942, for a total of 4,000,000 miles without a scratch of anyone's  finger.                                        CHAPTER VIII                        Results of Fleet Operations          [Illustration: Moored airship and flying airship]    Goodyear airships made some contribution during the 16 years of fleet  operations, to flight and ground handling technique. They also  contributed to men's knowledge about weather. For wherever it is flying,  an airship, by the very nature of the craft, is continually registering  the effects at that point of certain components of weather. And the  ships covered a considerable part of the country fairly thoroughly.    The nature and movements of air currents can be studied only  incompletely from the ground, for conditions there are merely the result  of forces aloft. Only two vehicles leave the ground and use the air as  highways. Of these the airship is vastly more responsive to changes in  temperatures and barometric pressure than the airplane, because of the  lifting gas in its envelope, and somewhat more responsive to changes in  wind directions and velocities, because of its greater displacement of  air.    Goodyear airships have traveled widely, have seen at first-hand the  effects of rain and snow, fog and sleet, wind and whirlwind, thunderhead  and lightning storm. More important they have been spectators at the  unseen battle waged endlessly between cold fronts and warm ones across  the great central plains, continued with renewed vindictiveness through  mountain ranges and valleys.    The information brought by these voyagers has not been without value to  the men in the airport control towers, who are studying weather  phenomena in the effort to make flying safe.    A whole new science of weather interpretation has come in with air  transport, and the U. S. Weather Bureau has other duties than advising  farmers about planting and harvesting crops. It may be merely  coincidence that when a new chief had to be selected for the Weather  Bureau a few years ago an airship pilot was selected--Commander F. W.  Reichelderfer of the Navy, who had long studied the movement of air  masses and their effect on flight.    Army and Navy ships put in more actual flying days per month than  Goodyear ships, when on coastal patrol, because once out at sea the  service ships were out for all day--and an airship, by picking its time,  and using its mast, can always get out and get back.    Goodyear pilots had a different sort of job. They were operating over  land, flying 100 passengers a day, at 10 to 15 minute intervals, in one  town after another. They might suspend operations when ceilings were  low, or winds high, or gusty, not because they couldn't fly under those  circumstances, but because flights would be less agreeable, and might be  hazardous for their passengers. However, the ships themselves, having no  shelter at hand, had to stay out and take it. Their job was to interest  the people of America in lighter-than-air, and they had to go wherever  people were, regardless of what flying weather might intervene.    So between Navy, Army and Goodyear airships operating over a period of  years, it was fairly well demonstrated that there is very little  unflyable weather for lighter-than-air craft. That is a conclusion of no  small importance.

Having caught a specimen of this fly, I next proceeded to institute a  comparison between it and the tsetse, as described by Dr. Livingstone on  pp. 56-57, 'Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa' (Murray's  edition of 1868). The points of disagreement are many, and such as to  make it entirely improbable that this fly is the true tsetse, though my  men unanimously stated that its bite was fatal to horses as well as to  donkeys. A descriptive abstract of the tsetse would read thus: \"Not much  larger than a common house-fly, nearly of the same brown colour as the  honey-bee. After-part of the body has yellow bars across it. It has a  peculiar buzz, and its bite is death to the horse, ox, and dog. On man  the bite has no effect, neither has it on wild animals. When allowed  to feed on the hand, it inserts the middle prong of three portions into  which the proboscis divides, it then draws the prong out a little  way, and it assumes a crimson colour as the mandibles come into brisk  operation; a slight itching irritation follows the bite.\"    The fly which I had under inspection is called mabunga by the natives.  It is much larger than the common housefly, fully a third larger than  the common honey-bee, and its colour more distinctly marked; its head is  black, with a greenish gloss to it; the after-part of the body is marked  by a white line running lengthwise from its junction with the trunk, and  on each side of this white line are two other lines, one of a crimson  colour, the other of a light brown. As for its buzz, there is no  peculiarity in it, it might be mistaken for that of a honey-bee. When  caught it made desperate efforts to get away, but never attempted to  bite. This fly, along with a score of others, attacked my grey horse,  and bit it so sorely in the legs that they appeared as if bathed in  blood. Hence, I might have been a little vengeful if, with more than the  zeal of an entomologist, I caused it to disclose whatever peculiarities  its biting parts possessed.    In order to bring this fly as life-like as possible before my readers, I  may compare its head to most tiny miniature of an elephant's, because it  has a black proboscis and a pair of horny antennae, which in colour and  curve resemble tusks. The black proboscis, however, the simply a hollow  sheath, which encloses, when not in the act of biting, four reddish  and sharp lancets. Under the microscope these four lancets differ in  thickness, two are very thick, the third is slender, but the fourth, of  an opal colour and almost transparent, is exceedingly fine. This last  must be the sucker. When the fly is about to wound, the two horny  antennae are made to embrace the part, the lancets are unsheathed, and  on the instant the incision is performed. This I consider to be the  African \"horse-fly.\"    The second fly, which sang the tenor notes more nearly resembled in size  and description the tsetse. It was exceedingly nimble, and it occupied  three soldiers nearly an hour to capture a specimen; and, when it was  finally caught, it stung most ravenously the hand, and never ceased  its efforts to attack until it was pinned through. It had three or four  white marks across the after-part of its body; but the biting parts of  this fly consisted of two black antennae and an opal coloured style,  which folded away under the neck. When about to bite, this style was  shot out straight, and the antennae embraced it closely. After death the  fly lost its distinctive white marks. Only one of this species did  we see at this camp. The third fly, called \"chufwa,\" pitched a weak  alto-crescendo note, was a third larger than the house fly, and had long  wings. If this insect sang the feeblest note, it certainly did the most  work, and inflicted the most injury. Horses and donkeys streamed with  blood, and reared and kicked through the pain. So determined was it not  to be driven before it obtained its fill, that it was easily despatched;  but this dreadful enemy to cattle constantly increased in numbers. The  three species above named are, according to natives, fatal to  cattle; and this may perhaps be the reason why such a vast expanse of  first-class pasture is without domestic cattle of any kind, a few goats  only being kept by the villagers. This fly I subsequently found to be  the \"tsetse.\"    On the second morning, instead of proceeding, I deemed it more prudent  to await the fourth caravan. Burton experimented sufficiently for me  on the promised word of the Banyans of Kaole and Zanzibar, and waited  eleven months before he received the promised articles. As I did not  expect to be much over that time on my errand altogether, it would be  ruin, absolute and irremediable, should I be detained at Unyanyembe so  long a time by my caravan. Pending its arrival, I sought the pleasures  of the chase. I was but a tyro in hunting, I confess, though I had shot  a little on the plains of America and Persia; yet I considered myself  a fair shot, and on game ground, and within a reasonable proximity to  game, I doubted not but I could bring some to camp.    After a march of a mile through the tall grass of the open, we gained  the glades between the jungles. Unsuccessful here, after ever so much  prying into fine hiding-places and lurking corners, I struck a trail  well traversed by small antelope and hartebeest, which we followed. It  led me into a jungle, and down a watercourse bisecting it; but, after  following it for an hour, I lost it, and, in endeavouring to retrace it,  lost my way. However, my pocket-compass stood me in good stead; and by  it I steered for the open plain, in the centre of which stood the camp.  But it was terribly hard work--this of plunging through an African  jungle, ruinous to clothes, and trying to the cuticle. In order to  travel quickly, I had donned a pair of flannel pyjamas, and my feet were  encased in canvas shoes. As might be expected, before I had gone a  few paces a branch of the acacia horrida--only one of a hundred such  annoyances--caught the right leg of my pyjamas at the knee, and ripped  it almost clean off; succeeding which a stumpy kolquall caught me by the  shoulder, and another rip was the inevitable consequence. A few yards  farther on, a prickly aloetic plant disfigured by a wide tear the  other leg of my pyjamas, and almost immediately I tripped against a  convolvulus strong as ratline, and was made to measure my length on a  bed of thorns. It was on all fours, like a hound on a scent, that I was  compelled to travel; my solar topee getting the worse for wear every  minute; my skin getting more and more wounded; my clothes at each step  becoming more and more tattered. Besides these discomforts, there was  a pungent, acrid plant which, apart from its strong odorous emissions,  struck me smartly on the face, leaving a burning effect similar to  cayenne; and the atmosphere, pent in by the density of the jungle, was  hot and stifling, and the perspiration transuded through every pore,  making my flannel tatters feel as if I had been through a shower. When I  had finally regained the plain, and could breathe free, I mentally vowed  that the penetralia of an African jungle should not be visited by me  again, save under most urgent necessity.    The second and third day passed without any news of Maganga.  Accordingly, Shaw and Bombay were sent to hurry him up by all means.  On the fourth morning Shaw and Bombay returned, followed by the  procrastinating Maganga and his laggard people. Questions only elicited  an excuse that his men had been too sick, and he had feared to tax their  strength before they were quite equal to stand the fatigue. Moreover he  suggested that as they would be compelled to stay one day more at the  camp, I might push on to Kingaru and camp there, until his arrival.  Acting upon which suggestion I broke camp and started for Kingaru,  distant five miles.    On this march the land was more broken, and the caravan first  encountered jungle, which gave considerable trouble to our cart.  Pisolitic limestone cropped out in boulders and sheets, and we began  to imagine ourselves approaching healthy highlands, and as if to give  confirmation to the thought, to the north and north-west loomed the  purple cones of Udoe, and topmost of all Dilima Peak, about 1,500 feet  in height above the sea level. But soon after sinking into a bowl-like  valley, green with tall corn, the road slightly deviated from north-west  to west, the country still rolling before us in wavy undulations.    In one of the depressions between these lengthy land-swells stood the  village of Kingaru, with surroundings significant in their aspect  of ague and fever. Perhaps the clouds surcharged with rain, and the  overhanging ridges and their dense forests dulled by the gloom, made the  place more than usually disagreeable, but my first impressions of the  sodden hollow, pent in by those dull woods, with the deep gully close by  containing pools of stagnant water, were by no means agreeable.    Before we could arrange our camp and set the tents up, down poured the  furious harbinger of the Masika season in torrents sufficient to damp  the ardor and newborn love for East Africa I had lately manifested.  However, despite rain, we worked on until our camp was finished and the  property was safely stored from weather and thieves, and we could regard  with resignation the raindrops beating the soil into mud of a very  tenacious kind, and forming lakelets and rivers of our camp-ground.    Towards night, the scene having reached its acme of unpleasantness, the  rain ceased, and the natives poured into camp from the villages in the  woods with their vendibles. Foremost among these, as if in duty bound,  came the village sultan--lord, chief, or head--bearing three measures  of matama and half a measure of rice, of which he begged, with paternal  smiles, my acceptance. But under his smiling mask,"]]]
