It was Necile's idea to  make some of the dolls say \"papa\" and \"mama.\"  It was a thought of the  Knooks to put a squeak inside the lambs, so that when a child squeezed  them they would say \"baa-a-a-a!\"  And the Fairy Queen advised Claus to  put whistles in the birds, so they could be made to sing, and wheels on  the horses, so children could draw them around.  Many animals perished  in the Forest, from one cause or another, and their fur was brought to  Claus that he might cover with it the small images of beasts he made  for playthings.  A merry Ryl suggested that Claus make a donkey with a  nodding head, which he did, and afterward found that it amused the  little ones immensely.  And so the toys grew in beauty and  attractiveness every day, until they were the wonder of even the  immortals.    When another Christmas Eve drew near there was a monster load of  beautiful gifts for the children ready to be loaded upon the big  sledge.  Claus filled three sacks to the brim, and tucked every corner  of the sledge-box full of toys besides.    Then, at twilight, the ten reindeer appeared and Flossie introduced  them all to Claus.  They were Racer and Pacer, Reckless and Speckless,  Fearless and Peerless, and Ready and Steady, who, with Glossie and  Flossie, made up the ten who have traversed the world these hundreds of  years with their generous master.  They were all exceedingly beautiful,  with slender limbs, spreading antlers, velvety dark eyes and smooth  coats of fawn color spotted with white.    Claus loved them at once, and has loved them ever since, for they are  loyal friends and have rendered him priceless service.    The new harness fitted them nicely and soon they were all fastened to  the sledge by twos, with Glossie and Flossie in the lead.  These wore  the strings of sleigh-bells, and were so delighted with the music they  made that they kept prancing up and down to make the bells ring.    Claus now seated himself in the sledge, drew a warm robe over his knees  and his fur cap over his ears, and cracked his long whip as a signal to  start.    Instantly the ten leaped forward and were away like the wind, while  jolly Claus laughed gleefully to see them run and shouted a song in his  big, hearty voice:          \"With a ho, ho, ho!        And a ha, ha, ha!    And a ho, ho, ha, ha, hee!        Now away we go        O'er the frozen snow,    As merry as we can be!          There are many joys        In our load of toys,    As many a child will know;        We'll scatter them wide        On our wild night ride    O'er the crisp and sparkling snow!\"      Now it was on this same Christmas Eve that little Margot and her  brother Dick and her cousins Ned and Sara, who were visiting at  Margot's house, came in from making a snow man, with their clothes  damp, their mittens dripping and their shoes and stockings wet through  and through.  They were not scolded, for Margot's mother knew the snow  was melting, but they were sent early to bed that their clothes might  be hung over chairs to dry.  The shoes were placed on the red tiles of  the hearth, where the heat from the hot embers would strike them, and  the stockings were carefully hung in a row by the chimney, directly  over the fireplace.  That was the reason Santa Claus noticed them when  he came down the chimney that night and all the household were fast  asleep.  He was in a tremendous hurry and seeing the stockings all  belonged to children he quickly stuffed his toys into them and dashed  up the chimney again, appearing on the roof so suddenly that the  reindeer were astonished at his agility.    \"I wish they would all hang up their stockings,\" he thought, as he  drove to the next chimney.  \"It would save me a lot of time and I could  then visit more children before daybreak.\"    When Margot and Dick and Ned and Sara jumped out of bed next morning  and ran downstairs to get their stockings from the fireplace they were  filled with delight to find the toys from Santa Claus inside them.  In  face, I think they found more presents in their stockings than any  other children of that city had received, for Santa Claus was in a  hurry and did not stop to count the toys.    Of course they told all their little friends about it, and of course  every one of them decided to hang his own stockings by the fireplace  the next Christmas Eve.  Even Bessie Blithesome, who made a visit to  that city with her father, the great Lord of Lerd, heard the story from  the children and hung her own pretty stockings by the chimney when she  returned home at Christmas time.    On his next trip Santa Claus found so many stockings hung up in  anticipation of his visit that he could fill them in a jiffy and be  away again in half the time required to hunt the children up and place  the toys by their bedsides.    The custom grew year after year, and has always been a great help to  Santa Claus.  And, with so many children to visit, he surely needs all  the help we are able to give him.        12.  The First Christmas Tree    Claus had always kept his promise to the Knooks by returning to the  Laughing Valley by daybreak, but only the swiftness of his reindeer has  enabled him to do this, for he travels over all the world.    He loved his work and he loved the brisk night ride on his sledge and  the gay tinkle of the sleigh-bells.  On that first trip with the ten  reindeer only Glossie and Flossie wore bells; but each year thereafter  for eight years Claus carried presents to the children of the Gnome  King, and that good-natured monarch gave him in return a string of  bells at each visit, so that finally every one of the ten deer was  supplied, and you may imagine what a merry tune the bells played as the  sledge sped over the snow.    The children's stockings were so long that it required a great many  toys to fill them, and soon Claus found there were other things besides  toys that children love.  So he sent some of the Fairies, who were  always his good friends, into the Tropics, from whence they returned  with great bags full of oranges and bananas which they had plucked from  the trees.  And other Fairies flew to the wonderful Valley of  Phunnyland, where delicious candies and bonbons grow thickly on the  bushes, and returned laden with many boxes of sweetmeats for the little  ones.  These things Santa Claus, on each Christmas Eve, placed in the  long stockings, together with his toys, and the children were glad to  get them, you may be sure.    There are also warm countries where there is no snow in winter, but  Claus and his reindeer visited them as well as the colder climes, for  there were little wheels inside the runners of his sledge which  permitted it to run as smoothly over bare ground as on the snow.  And  the children who lived in the warm countries learned to know the name  of Santa Claus as well as those who lived nearer to the Laughing Valley.    Once, just as the reindeer were ready to start on their yearly trip, a  Fairy came to Claus and told him of three little children who lived  beneath a rude tent of skins on a broad plain where there were no trees  whatever.  These poor babies were miserable and unhappy, for their  parents were ignorant people who neglected them sadly.  Claus resolved  to visit these children before he returned home, and during his ride he  picked up the bushy top of a pine tree which the wind had broken off  and placed it in his sledge.    It was nearly morning when the deer stopped before the lonely tent of  skins where the poor children lay asleep.  Claus at once planted the  bit of pine tree in the sand and stuck many candles on the branches.  Then he hung some of his prettiest toys on the tree, as well as several  bags of candies.  It did not take long to do all this, for Santa Claus  works quickly, and when all was ready he lighted the candles and,  thrusting his head in at the opening of the tent, he shouted:    \"Merry Christmas, little ones!\"    With that he leaped into his sledge and was out of sight before the  children, rubbing the sleep from their eyes, could come out to see who  had called them.    You can imagine the wonder and joy of those little ones, who had never  in their lives known a real pleasure before, when they saw the tree,  sparkling with lights that shone brilliant in the gray dawn and hung  with toys enough to make them happy for years to come!  They joined  hands and danced around the tree, shouting and laughing, until they  were obliged to pause for breath.  And their parents, also, came out to  look and wonder, and thereafter had more respect and consideration for  their children, since Santa Claus had honored them with such beautiful  gifts.    The idea of the Christmas tree pleased Claus, and so the following year  he carried many of them in his sledge and set them up in the homes of  poor people who seldom saw trees, and placed candles and toys on the  branches.  Of course he could not carry enough trees in one load of all  who wanted them, but in some homes the fathers were able to get trees  and have them all ready for Santa Claus when he arrived; and these the  good Claus always decorated as prettily as possible and hung with toys  enough for all the children who came to see the tree lighted.    These novel ideas and the generous manner in which they were carried  out made the children long for that one night in the year when their  friend Santa Claus should visit them, and as such anticipation is very  pleasant and comforting the little ones gleaned much happiness by  wondering what would happen when Santa Claus next arrived.    Perhaps you remember that stern Baron Braun who once drove Claus from  his castle and forbade him to visit his children?  Well, many years  afterward, when the old Baron was dead and his son ruled in his place,  the new Baron Braun came to the house of Claus with his train of  knights and pages and henchmen and, dismounting from his charger, bared  his head humbly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#14)"],[1,": ¿Qué te amedrenta,            Does it cause you to fear,  si a tus ojos se presenta               that some rich Don Juan Tenorio  muy rico don Juan Tenorio.              presents himself to your eyes                                          here?
