You are unable even to return my brother's  corpse.\" Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by his divine  power, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus  was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.    The brothers had a long talk about each other's adventures. They both  went to Ujjaini, where Gangazara married the princess, and succeeded  to the throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring  several benefits upon his brother. And so the horoscope was fully  fulfilled.    [Illustration:]          Harisarman      There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He  was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he  had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds  in a former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at  last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich  householder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of  Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him,  and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an  attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the  daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the  bridegroom, and merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able  to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other  dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron.  While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him.    [Illustration:]    Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his  wife at night, \"It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am  treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an  artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an  object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an  opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge.\" He said this  to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people  were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on  which his master's son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at  some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could  not find the horse, though they searched in every direction. Then,  while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for  the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came  and said to him, \"My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and  magical sciences; he can get the horse back for you; why do you not  ask him?\" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who  said, \"Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen,  I am called to mind,\" and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman  with these words--\"I forgot you, forgive me\"--and asked him to tell  him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of  pretended diagrams, and said: \"The horse has been placed by thieves on  the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and  before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day,  go quickly and bring it.\" When they heard that, many men ran and  brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman.  Then Harisarman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in  happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta.    Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been  stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not  known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his  reputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to  gain time, and said, \"I will tell you to-morrow,\" and then he was  placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad  because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there  was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance  of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the  palace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night  and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out  what he was about. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that  very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of  knowledge. He said: \"O Tongue, what is this that you have done  through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment  in full.\" When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she  had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where  he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard:  \"Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the  thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in  a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and  receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession.\"    When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: \"Depart, I know  all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce  you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But  whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me.\" When he  said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But  Harisarman reflected in his astonishment: \"Fate brings about, as if in  sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would  have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming  my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret  crimes manifest themselves by means of fear.\" Thus thinking, he passed  the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the  king, by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden,  and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate  tree, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the  king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages.    But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear: \"How  can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having  studied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen  of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret  intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some  new artifice.\" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered  pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman,  \"Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do  you great honour to-day.\" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he  thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet  name of \"Froggie\" which his father had given him in his childhood in  sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name,  lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out: \"This is a fine  pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of  your helpless self.\" The people there, when they heard him say that,  raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with  the object presented to him, and murmured, \"Ah! a great sage, he knows  even about the frog!\" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to  knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the  revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages  of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world.          The Charmed Ring      A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade  him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the  money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some  herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill.  \"Please do not kill the dog,\" pleaded the young and tender-hearted  fellow; \"I will give you one hundred rupees for it.\" Then and there,  of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the  dog, and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting  about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. \"Oh!  please do not kill it,\" said he; \"I will give you one hundred rupees  for it.\" Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money.  He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling  over a snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill  it, but others did not. \"Please do not kill the snake,\" said he; \"I  will give you one hundred rupees.\" Of course the people agreed, and  were highly delighted.    What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money  was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he  went home.    \"You fool! You scamp!\" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his  son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. \"Go and live  in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter  my house.\"    So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass  spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and  the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very  fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by  him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head,  and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its  tail on the other.    One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, \"I am  the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground  to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had  you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I  shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would  that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's  preserver!\"    \"Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,\" said the  young man.    \"Well said!\" continued the snake. \"Do you see yonder mountain?

He had renounced high prospects in the church, and contented  himself with the simple abbacy of Clairvaux, in order that he might  have the leisure he desired, to raise his powerful voice against abuses  wherever he found them. Vice met in him an austere and uncompromising  reprover; no man was too high for his reproach, and none too low for  his sympathy. He was just as well suited for his age as Peter the  Hermit had been for the age preceding. He appealed more to the reason,  his predecessor to the passions; Peter the Hermit collected a mob,  while St. Bernard collected an army. Both were endowed with equal zeal  and perseverance, springing, in the one, from impulse, and in the other  from conviction, and a desire to increase the influence of the church,  that great body of which he was a pillar and an ornament.    One of the first converts he made was in himself a host. Louis VII. was  both superstitious and tyrannical, and, in a fit of remorse for the  infamous slaughter he had authorised at the sacking of Vitry, he made a  vow to undertake the journey to the Holy Land. [The sacking of Vitry  reflects indelible disgrace upon Louis VII. His predecessors had been  long engaged in resistance to the outrageous powers assumed by the  Popes, and Louis continued the same policy. The ecclesiastical chapter  of Bourges, having elected an Archbishop without his consent, he  proclaimed the election to be invalid, and took severe and prompt  measures against the refractory clergy. Thibault, Count de Champagne,  took up arms in defence of the Papal authority, and intrenched himself  in the town of Vitry. Louis was immediately in the field to chastise  the rebel, and he besieged the town with so much vigour, that the Count  was forced to surrender. Upwards of thirteen hundred of the  inhabitants, fully one half of whom were women and children, took  refuge in the church; and, when the gates of the city were opened, and  all resistance had ceased, Louis inhumanly gave orders to set fire to  the church, and a thousand persons perished in the flames.] He was in  this disposition when St. Bernard began to preach, and wanted but  little persuasion to embark in the cause. His example had great  influence upon the nobility, who, impoverished as many of them were by  the sacrifices made by their fathers in the holy wars, were anxious to  repair their ruined fortunes by conquests on a foreign shore. These  took the field with such vassals as they could command, and, in a very  short time, an army was raised amounting to two hundred thousand men.  At Vezelai the monarch received the cross from the hands of St.  Bernard, on a platform elevated in sight of all the people. Several  nobles, three bishops, and his Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, were  present at this ceremony, and enrolled themselves under the banners of  the Cross, St. Bernard cutting up his red sacerdotal vestments, and  making crosses of them, to be sewn on the shoulders of the people. An  exhortation from the Pope was read to the multitude, granting remission  of their sins to all who should join the Crusade, and directing that no  man on that holy pilgrimage should encumber himself with heavy baggage  and vain superfluities, and that the nobles should not travel with dogs  or falcons, to lead them from the direct road, as had happened to so  many during the first Crusade.    The command of the army was offered to St. Bernard; but he wisely  refused to accept a station for which his habits had unqualified him.  After consecrating Louis with great solemnity, at St. Denis, as chief  of the expedition, he continued his course through the country,  stirring up the people wherever he went. So high an opinion was  entertained of his sanctity, that he was thought to be animated by the  spirit of prophecy, and to be gifted with the power of working  miracles. Many women, excited by his eloquence, and encouraged by his  predictions, forsook their husbands and children, and, clothing  themselves in male attire, hastened to the war. St. Bernard himself  wrote a letter to the Pope, detailing his success, and stating, that in  several towns there did not remain a single male inhabitant capable of  bearing arms, and that everywhere castles and towns were to be seen  filled with women weeping for their absent husbands. But in spite of  this apparent enthusiasm, the numbers who really took up arms were  inconsiderable, and not to be compared to the swarms of the first  Crusade. A levy of no more than two hundred thousand men, which was the  utmost the number amounted to, could hardly have depopulated a country  like France to the extent mentioned by St. Bernard. His description of  the state of the country appears, therefore, to have been much more  poetical than true.    Suger, the able minister of Louis, endeavoured to dissuade him from  undertaking so long a journey at a time when his own dominions so much  needed his presence. But the king was pricked in his conscience by the  cruelties of Vitry, and was anxious to make the only reparation which  the religion of that day considered sufficient. He was desirous  moreover of testifying to the world, that though he could brave the  temporal power of the church when it encroached upon his prerogatives,  he could render all due obedience to its spiritual decrees whenever it  suited his interest or tallied with his prejudices to so do. Suger,  therefore, implored in vain, and Louis received the pilgrim's staff at  St. Denis, and made all preparations for his pilgrimage.    In the mean time St. Bernard passed into Germany, where similar success  attended his preaching. The renown of his sanctity had gone before him,  and he found everywhere an admiring audience. Thousands of people, who  could not understand a word he said, flocked around him to catch a  glimpse of so holy a man; and the knights enrolled themselves in great  numbers in the service of the Cross, each receiving from his hands the  symbol of the cause. But the people were not led away as in the days of  Gottschalk. We do not find that they rose in such tremendous masses of  two and three hundred thousand men, swarming over the country like a  plague of locusts. Still the enthusiasm was very great. The  extraordinary tales that were told and believed of the miracles worked  by the preacher brought the country people from far and near. Devils  were said to vanish at his sight, and diseases of the most malignant  nature to be cured by his touch. [Philip, Archdeacon of the cathedral  of Liege, wrote a detailed account of all the miracles performed by St.  Bernard during thirty-four days of his mission. They averaged about ten  per day. The disciples of St. Bernard complained bitterly that the  people flocked around their master in such numbers, that they could not  see half the miracles he performed. But they willingly trusted the eyes  of others, as far as faith in the miracles went, and seemed to vie with  each other whose credulity should be greatest.] The Emperor Conrad  caught at last the contagion from his subjects, and declared his  intention to follow the Cross.    The preparations were carried on so vigorously under the orders of  Conrad, that in less than three months he found himself at the head of  an army containing at least one hundred and fifty thousand effective  men, besides a great number of women who followed their husbands and  lovers to the war. One troop of them rode in the attitude and armour of  men: their chief wore gilt spurs and buskins, and thence acquired the  epithet of the golden-footed lady. Conrad was ready to set out long  before the French Monarch, and in the month of June 1147, he arrived  before Constantinople, having passed through Hungary and Bulgaria  without offence to the inhabitants.    Manuel Comnenus, the Greek Emperor, successor not only to the throne,  but to the policy of Alexius, looked with alarm upon the new levies who  had come to eat up his capital and imperil its tranquillity. Too weak  to refuse them a passage through his dominions, too distrustful of them  to make them welcome when they came, and too little assured of the  advantages likely to result to himself from the war, to feign a  friendship which he did not feel, the Greek Emperor gave offence at the  very outset. His subjects, in the pride of superior civilization,  called the Germans barbarians, while the latter, who, if  semi-barbarous, were at least honest and straight-forward, retorted  upon the Greeks by calling them double-faced knaves and traitors.  Disputes continually arose between them, and Conrad, who had preserved  so much good order among his followers during their passage, was unable  to restrain their indignation when they arrived at Constantinople. For  some offence or other which the Greeks had given them, but which is  rather hinted at than stated by the scanty historians of the day, the  Germans broke into the magnificent pleasure garden of the Emperor,  where he had a valuable collection of tame animals, for which the  grounds had been laid out in woods, caverns, groves, and streams, that  each might follow in captivity his natural habits. The enraged Germans,  meriting the name of barbarians that had been bestowed upon them, laid  waste this pleasant retreat, and killed or let loose the valuable  animals it contained. Manuel, who is said to have beheld the  devastation from his palace windows without power or courage to prevent  it, was completely disgusted with his guests, and resolved, like his  predecessor Alexius, to get rid of them on the first opportunity. He  sent a message to Conrad respectfully desiring an interview, but the  German refused to trust himself within the walls of"]]]
