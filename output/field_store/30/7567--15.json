The first resource of the superannuated or  discharged police detective is to start an agency. Of course, he may be  first class in spite of these disqualifications, but the presumption in  the first instance is that he is no longer alert or effective, and  in the second that in one way or another he is not honest. Agencies  recruited from deposed and other ex-policemen usually have all the  faults of the police without any of their virtues. There are many small  agencies which do reliable work, and there are a number of private  detectives in all the big cities who work single-handed and achieve  excellent results. However, if he expects to accomplish anything by  hiring detectives, the layman or lawyer must first make sure of his  agency or his man.    One other feature of the detective business should not be overlooked. In  addition to charging for services not actually rendered and expenses not  actually incurred, there is in many cases a strong temptation to betray  the interests of the employer. A private detective may, and usually  does, become possessed of information even more valuable to the person  who is being watched than to the person to whom he owes his allegiance.  Unreliable rascals constantly sell out to the other side and play  both ends against the middle. In this they resemble some of the famous  diplomatic agents of history. And police detectives employed to run down  criminals and protect society have been known instead to act as stalls  for bank burglars and (for a consideration) to assist them to dispose of  their booty and protect them from arrest and capture. It has repeatedly  happened that reliable private detectives have discovered that the  police employed upon the same case have in reality been tipping off  the criminals as to what was being done and coaching them as to their  conduct. Of course the natural jealousy existing between official and  unofficial agents of the law leads to many unfounded accusations of  this character, but, on the other hand, the fact that much of the most  effective police work is done by employing professional criminals to  secure information and act as stool-pigeons often results in a definite  understanding that the latter shall be themselves protected in the quiet  enjoyment of their labors. The relations of the regular police to crime,  however, and the general subject of police graft have little place in a  chapter of this character.    The first question that usually arises is whether a detective shall or  shall not be employed at all in any particular case. Usually the most  important thing is to find out what the real character, past, and  associations of some particular individual may be. Well-established  detective agencies with offices throughout the country are naturally in  a better position to acquire such information quickly than the private  individual or lawyer, since they are on the spot and have an organized  staff containing the right sort of men for the work. If the information  lies in your own city you can probably hire some one to get it or ferret  it out yourself quite as well, and much more cheaply, than by employing  their services. The leads are few and generally simple. The subject's  past employers and business associates, his landlords and landladies,  his friends and enemies, and his milkman must be run down and  interrogated. Perhaps his personal movements must be watched. Any  intelligent fellow who is out of a job will do this for you for about $5  a day and expenses. The agencies usually charge from $6 to $8 (and up),  and prefer two men to one, as a matter of convenience and to make sure  that the subject is fully covered. If the suspect is on the move and  trains or steamships must be met, you have practically no choice but to  employ a national agency. It alone has the proper plant and equipment  for the work. In an emergency, organization counts more than anything  else. Where time is of the essence, the individual has no opportunity to  hire his own men or start an organization of his own. But if the matter  is one where there is plenty of leisure to act, you can usually do your  own detective work better and cheaper than any one else.    Regarding the work of the detective as a spy (which probably constitutes  seventy-five per cent of his employment to-day), few persons realize  how widely such services are being utilized. The insignificant old  Irishwoman who stumbles against you in the department store is  possibly watching with her cloudy but eagle eye for shoplifters. The  tired-looking man on the street-car may, in fact, be a professional  \"spotter.\" The stout youth with the pince nez who is examining the  wedding presents is perhaps a central-office man. All this you know or  may suspect. But you are not so likely to be aware that the floor-walker  himself is the agent of a rival concern placed in the department store  to keep track, not only of prices but of whether or not the wholesalers  are living up to their agreements in regard to the furnishing of  particular kinds of goods only to one house; or that the conductor on  the car is a paid detective of the company, whose principal duty is not  to collect fares, but to report the doings of the unions; or that the  gentleman who is accidentally introduced to you at the wedding breakfast  is employed by a board of directors to get a line on your host's  business associates and social companions.    In the great struggle between capital and labor, each side has  expended large sums of money in employing confederates to secure secret  information as to the plans and doings of the enemy. Almost every labor  union has its Judas, and less often a secretary to a capitalist is  in the secret employment of a labor union. The railroads must be kept  informed of what is going on, and, if necessary, they import a man from  another part of the country to join the local organization. Often such  men, on account of their force and intelligence, are elected to high  office in the brotherhoods whose secrets they are hired to betray.  Practically every big manufacturing plant in the United States has  on its payrolls men acting as engineers, foremen, or laborers who are  drawing from $80 to $100 per month as detectives either (1) to keep  their employers informed as to the workings of the labor unions, (2)  to report to the directors the actual conduct of the business by its  salaried officers, superintendents, and overseers, or (3) to ascertain  and report to outside competing concerns the methods and processes made  use of, the materials utilized, and the exact cost of production.    There are detectives among the chambermaids and bellboys in the hotels,  and also among the guests; there are detectives on the passenger lists  and in the cardrooms of the Atlantic liners; the colored porter on  the private car, the butler at your friend's house, the chorus girl on  Broadway, the clerk in the law office, the employee in the commercial  agency, may all be drawing pay in the interest of some one else, who may  be either a transportation company, a stock-broker, a rival financier,  a yellow newspaper, an injured or even an erring wife, a grievance  committee, or a competing concern; and the duties of these persons  may and will range from the theft of mailing lists, books, papers,  and private letters, up to genuine detective work requiring some real  ability.    Detective work of the sort which involves the betrayal of confidences  and friendships naturally excites our aversion--yet in many cases the  end undoubtedly justifies the means employed, and often there is no  other way to avert disaster and prevent fiendish crimes. Sometimes, on  the other hand, the information sought is purely for mercenary or even  less worthy reasons, and those engaged in these undertakings range from  rascals of the lowest type to men who are ready to risk death for the  cause which they represent and who are really heroes of a high order.  One of the latter with whom I happened to be thrown professionally was a  young fellow of about twenty named Guthrie.    It was during a great strike, and outrages were being committed all over  the city of New York by dynamiters supposed to be in the employ of  the unions. Young Guthrie, who was a reckless daredevil, offered his  services to the employers, and agreed to join one of the local unions  and try to find out who were the men blowing up office buildings in  process of construction and otherwise terrorizing the inhabitants of the  city. Accordingly he applied for membership in the organization, and by  giving evidence of his courage and fiber managed to secure a place as a  volunteer in the dynamiting squad. So cleverly did he pass himself off  as a bitter enemy of capital that he was entrusted with secrets of  the utmost value and took part in making the plans and procuring the  dynamite to execute them. The quality of his nerve (as well as his  foolhardiness) is shown by the fact that he once carried a dress-suit  case full of the explosive around the city, jumping on and off street  cars, and dodging vehicles. When the proper moment came and the dynamite  had been placed in an uncompleted building on Twenty-second Street,  Guthrie gave the signal and the police arrested the dynamiters--all of  them, including Guthrie, who was placed with the rest in a cell in  the Tombs and continued to report to the district attorney all the  information which he thus secured from his unsuspecting associates.  Indeed, it was hard to convince the authorities that Guthrie was a spy  and not a mere accomplice who had turned State's evidence, a distinction  of far-reaching legal significance so far as his evidence was concerned.    The final episode in the drama was the unearthing by the police of  Hoboken of the secret cache of the dynamiters, containing a large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#14)"],[1,". Some months ago I      borrowed the Golden Bible, put it into my pocket, carried it home,      and thought no more about it. About a week after my wife found the      book in my coat pocket as it hung up, and commenced reading it      aloud as I lay upon the bed. She had not read twenty minutes when      I was astonished to find the same passages in it that Spaulding      had read to me more than twenty years before from his 'Manuscript      Found.' Since that I have more carefully examined the said Golden      Bible, and have no hesitation in saying that the historical part of      it principally, if not wholly, taken from the 'Manuscript Found.'      I well recollect telling Mr. Spaulding that the so frequent use of      the words, 'And it came to pass,' 'Now it came to pass,' rendered      it ridiculous.\"    IV.    Our fourth witness is John N. Miller, who was employed by Spaulding and  Lake at Conneaut and boarded at the former's home. Miller says:        \"He [Spaulding] had written two or three books or pamphlets on      different subjects, but that which more particularly drew my      attention was the one which he called the 'Manuscript Found.' From      this he would frequently read some humorous passages to the company      present. It purported to be the history of the first settlement of      America before discovered by Columbus. He brought them off from      Jerusalem under their leaders, detailing their travels by land and      water, their manners, customs, laws, wars, etc. He said that he      designed it as a historical novel, and that in after years it would      be believed by many people as much as the history of England. He      soon after failed in business, and told me he should retire from      the din of his creditors, finish his book, and have it published,      which would enable him to pay his debts and support his family. He      soon after removed to Pittsburg, as I understood. I have recently      examined the Book of Mormon, and find in it the writings of Solomon      Spaulding from beginning to end, but mixed up with Scripture      and other religious matters which I did not meet with in the      'Manuscript Found.' Many of the passages in the Mormon book are      verbatim from Spaulding, and others in part. The names of _Nephi,      Lehi, Moroni,_ and, in fact; all the principal names are brought      fresh to my recollection by the Golden Bible. When Spaulding      divested his history of its fabulous names by a verbal explanation,      he landed his people near the Straits of Darien, which I am very      confident he called Zarahemla; they were marched about that country      for a length of time in which wars and great bloodshed ensued. He      brought them across North America in a northeast direction.        \"JOHN N. MILLER.\"    Our fifth witness is Aaron Wright, who says:        \"I first became acquainted with Solomon Spaulding in 1808 or 1809,      when he commenced building a forge on Conneaut Creek. When at his      house one day, he showed and read to me a history he was writing      of the lost tribes of Israel, purporting that they were the first      settlers of America, and that the Indians were their descendants.      Upon this subject we had frequent conversations. He traced their      journey from Jerusalem to America as it is given in the Book of      Mormon, excepting the religious matter. The historical part of the      Book of Mormon I know to be the same as I read and heard read from      the writings of Spaulding more than twenty years ago; the names are      especially the same without any alteration. He told me his object      was to account for all the fortifications, etc., to be found in      this country, and said that in time it would be fully believed by      all except learned men and historians. I once anticipated reading      his writings in print, but little expected to see them in a new      Bible. Spaulding _had many other manuscripts_ which I expect to      see when Smith translates his other plates. In conclusion I will      observe that the names of, and most of the historical part of the      Book of Mormon, were as familiar to me before I read it as most      modern history. If it is not Spaulding's writing, it is the same      as he wrote; and if Smith was inspired, I think it was by the same      spirit that Spaulding was, which he confessed to be the love of      money.        \"AARON WRIGHT.\"    Our sixth witness is Oliver Smith, who testifies:        \"When Solomon Spaulding first came to this place [Conneaut], he      purchased a tract of land, surveyed it out, and commenced selling      it. While engaged in this business he boarded at my house, in all      nearly six months. All his leisure hours were occupied in writing a      historical novel founded upon the first settlers of this country.      He said he intended to trace their journey from Jerusalem, by land      and sea, till their arrival in America, and give an account of      their arts, sciences, civilization, wars and contentions. In this      way he would give a satisfactory account of all the old mounds      so Common to this country. During the time he was at my house I      read and heard read one hundred pages or more. Nephi and Lehi were      by him represented as leading characters when they first started      for America. Their main object was to escape the judgments which      they supposed were coming upon the old world. But no religious      matter was introduced, as I now recollect. * * * When I heard the      historical part of it related, I at once said it was the writings      of Solomon Spaulding. Soon after I obtained the book, and on      reading it, found much of it the same as Spaulding had written more      than twenty years before.        \"OLIVER SMITH.\"    Our seventh witness, Nahum Howard, avers this:        \"I first became acquainted with Solomon Spaulding in December,      1810. After that time I frequently saw him at his house, and also      at my house. I once, in conversation with him, expressed a surprise      at not having any account of the inhabitants once in this country,      who erected the old forts, mounds, etc. He then told me that he was      writing a history of that race of people and afterwards frequently      showed me his writings which I read. I have lately read the Book      of Mormon and believe it to be the same as Spaulding wrote, except      the religious part. He told me that he intended to get his writings      published in Pittsburg, and he thought that in one century from      that time it would be believed as much as any other history.        \"NAHUM HOWARD.\"    Our eighth witness is Artemas Cunningham, whose evidence reads thus:        \"In the month of October, 1811, I went from the township of Madison      to Conneaut, for the purpose of securing a debt due me from Solomon      Spaulding. I tarried with him nearly two days for the purpose of      accomplishing my object, which I was finally unable to do. I found      him destitute of the means of paying his debts. His only hope of      ever paying his debts appeared to be upon the sale of a book which      he had been writing. He endeavored to convince me from the nature      and character of the work that it would meet with a ready sale.      Before showing me his manuscripts, he went into a verbal relation      of its outlines, saying that it was a fabulous or romantic history      of the first settlement of this country, and as it purported to      have been a record found buried in the earth, or in a cave, he      had adopted the ancient or scripture style of writing. He then      presented his manuscripts, when we sat down and spent a good share      of the night in reading them and conversing upon them. I well      remember the name of Nephi, which appeared to be the principal hero      of the story. The frequent repetition of the phrase 'I, Nephi.' I      recollect as distinctly as though it was but yesterday, although      the general features of the story have passed from my memory      through the lapse of twenty-two years. He attempted to account for      the numerous antiquities which are found upon this continent, and      remarked that after this generation had passed away, his account of      the first inhabitants of America would be considered as authentic      as any other history. The Mormon Bible I have partially examined      and am fully of the opinion that Solomon Spaulding had written its      outlines before he left Conneaut.\" [151]    [Footnote 151: This ends the evidence taken from Howe's \"Mormonism  Unveiled,\" Chapter 19.]    After the publication of the foregoing evidence (1834) \"Apostle\" Orson  Hyde went to Conneaut, evidently to secure impeaching or contradicting  testimony. He received so little comfort that not even a public mention  of the trip was made by him until 1841, while he was in London. [152]    [Footnote 152: \"The Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" by Page, 10.]    Our ninth witness upon the facts showing the plagiarism of the Book  of Mormon from the Spaulding manuscript is Mr. Joseph Miller. He was  intimately acquainted with Solomon Spaulding during all of the time  while the latter resided at Amity, Pa. (1814-16).[153] Mr. Miller's  testimony is preserved in the Pittsburg _Telegraph_ of February 6,  1879, from which the following is pertinent:    [Footnote 153: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 6.]        \"On hearing read the account from the book [of Mormon] of the      battle between the Amlicites and the Nephites [Book of Alma,      Chapter 1--Chapter 3, Edition of '88--], in which the soldiers of      one army had placed a red mark on their foreheads to distinguish      them from their enemies, it seems to reproduce in my mind, not only      the narration, but the very words, as they had been impressed upon      my mind by the reading of Spaulding's manuscript.\"    Our tenth witness is Redick McKee, Whose"]]]
