As the  pumps worked more rapidly, and the sea was sent from the tank in great  volumes, the boat fairly shot to the surface. Tom was ready to open the  conning tower and let in fresh air as soon as the top was above the  surface.    With a bound the Advance reached the top. Tom frantically worked the  worm gear that opened the tower. In rushed the fresh, life-giving air,  and the treasure-hunters filled their lungs with it.    And it was only just in time, for Mr. Sharp was almost gone. He quickly  revived, as did the others, when they could breathe as much as they  wished of the glorious oxygen.    \"That was a close call,\" commented Mr. Swift. \"We'll not go below again  until I have provided for all emergencies. I should have seen to the  air tanks and the expanding one before going below. We'll sail home on  the surface now.\"    The submarine was put about and headed for her dock. On the way she  passed a small steamer, and the passengers looked down in wonder at the  strange craft.    When the Advance reached the secluded creek where she had been  launched, her passengers had fully recovered from their terrible  experience, though the nerves of Mr. Swift and Mr. Damon were not at  ease for some days thereafter.    \"I should never have made a submerged test without making sure that we  had a reserve supply of air,\" remarked the aged inventor. \"I will not  be caught that way again. But I can't understand how the pump valve got  out of order.\"    \"Maybe some one tampered with it,\" suggested Mr. Damon.  \"Could Andy  Foger, any of the Happy Harry gang, or the rival gold-seekers have done  it?\"    \"I hardly think so,\" answered Tom. \"The place has been too carefully  guarded since Berg and Andy once sneaked in. I think it was just an  accident, but I have thought of a plan whereby such accidents can be  avoided in the future. It needs a simple device.\"    \"Better patent it,\" suggested Mr. Sharp with a smile.    \"Maybe I will,\" replied the young inventor. \"But not now.  We haven't  time, if we intend to get fitted out for our trip.\"    \"No; I should say the sooner we started the better,\" remarked Captain  Weston. \"That is, if you don't mind me speaking about it,\" he added  gently, and the others smiled, for his diffident comments were only a  matter of habit.    The first act of the adventurers, after tying the submarine at the  dock, was to proceed with the loading of the food and supplies. Tom and  Mr. Damon looked to this, while Mr. Swift and Mr. Sharp made some  necessary changes to the machinery. The next day the young inventor  attached his device to the pump valve, and the loading of the craft was  continued.    All was in readiness for the gold-seeking expedition a week later.  Captain Weston had carefully charted the route they were to follow, and  it was decided to move along on the surface for the first day, so as to  get well out to sea before submerging the craft. Then it would sink  below the surface, and run along under the water until the wreck was  reached, rising at times, as needed, to renew the air supply.    With sufficient stores and provisions aboard to last several months, if  necessary, though they did not expect to be gone more than sixty days  at most, the adventurers arose early one morning and went down to the  dock. Mr. Jackson was not to accompany them. He did not care about a  submarine trip, he said, and Mr. Swift desired him to remain at the  seaside cottage and guard the shops, which contained much valuable  machinery. The airship was also left there.    \"Well, are we all ready?\" asked Mr. Swift of the little party of  gold-seekers, as they were about to enter the conning tower hatchway of  the submarine.    \"All ready, dad,\" responded his son.    \"Then let's get aboard,\" proposed Captain Weston. \"But first let me  take an observation.\"    He swept the horizon with his telescope, and Tom noticed that the  sailor kept it fixed on one particular spot for some time.    \"Did you see anything?\" asked the lad.    \"Well, there is a boat lying off there,\" was the answer.  \"And some one  is observing us through a glass. But I don't believe it matters.  Probably they're only trying to see what sort of an odd fish we are.\"    \"All aboard, then,\" ordered Mr. Swift, and they went into the  submarine. Tom and his father, with Captain Weston, remained in the  conning tower. The signal was given, the electricity flowed into the  forward and aft plates, and the Advance shot ahead on the surface.    The sailor raised his telescope once more and peered through a window  in the tower. He uttered an exclamation.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom.    \"That other ship--a small steamer--is weighing anchor and seems to be  heading this way,\" was the reply.    \"Maybe it's some one hired by Berg to follow us and trace our  movements,\" suggested Tom.    \"If it is we'll fool them,\" added his father. \"Just keep an eye on  them, captain, and I think we can show them a trick or two in a few  minutes.\"    Faster shot the Advance through the water. She had started on her way  to get the gold from the sunken wreck, but already enemies were on the  trail of the adventurers, for the ship the sailor had noticed was  steaming after them.          Chapter Fourteen    In the Diving Suits      There was no doubt that the steamer was coming after the submarine.  Several observations Captain Weston made confirmed this, and he  reported the fact to Mr. Swift.    \"Well, we'll change our plans, then,\" said the inventor.  \"Instead of  sailing on the surface we'll go below. But first let them get near so  they may have the benefit of seeing what we do. Tom, go below, please,  and tell Mr. Sharp to get every thing in readiness for a quick descent.  We'll slow up a bit now, and let them get nearer to us.\"    The speed of the submarine was reduced, and in a short time the strange  steamer had overhauled her, coming to within hailing distance.    Mr. Swift signaled for the machinery to stop and the submarine came to  a halt on the surface, bobbing about like a half-submerged bottle. The  inventor opened a bull's-eye in the tower, and called to a man on the  bridge of the steamer:    \"What are you following us for?\"    \"Following you?\" repeated the man, for the strange vessel had also come  to a stop. \"We're not following you.\"    \"It looks like it,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"You'd better give it up.\"    \"I guess the waters are free,\" was the quick retort.  \"We'll follow you  if we like.\"    \"Will you? Then come on!\" cried the inventor as he quickly closed the  heavy glass window and pulled a lever. An instant later the submarine  began to sink, and Mr. Swift could not help laughing as, just before  the tower went under water, he had a glimpse of the astonished face of  the man on the bridge. The latter had evidently not expected such a  move as that.    Lower and lower in the water went the craft, until it was about two  hundred feet below the surface. Then Mr. Swift left the conning tower,  descended to the main part of the ship, and asked Tom and Captain  Weston to take charge of the pilot house.    \"Send her ahead, Tom,\" his father said. \"That fellow up above is  rubbing his eyes yet, wondering where we are, I suppose.\"    Forward shot the Advance under water, the powerful electrical plates  pulling and pushing her on the way to secure the sunken gold.    All that morning a fairly moderate rate of speed was maintained, as it  was thought best not to run the new machinery too fast.    Dinner was eaten about a quarter of a mile below the surface, but no  one inside the submarine would ever have known it. Electric lights made  the place as brilliant as could be desired, and the food, which Tom and  Mr. Damon prepared, was equal to any that could have been served on  land. After the meal they opened the shutters over the windows in the  sides of the craft, and looked at the myriads of fishes swimming past,  as the creatures were disclosed in the glare of the searchlight.    That night they were several hundred miles on their journey, for the  craft was speedy, and leaving Tom and Captain Weston to take the first  watch, the others went to bed.    \"Bless my soul, but it does seem odd, though, to go to bed under water,  like a fish,\" remarked Mr. Damon. \"If my wife knew this she would worry  to death. She thinks I'm off automobiling. But this isn't half as  dangerous as riding in a car that's always getting out of order. A  submarine for mine, every time.\"    \"Wait until we get to the end of this trip,\" advised Tom.  \"I guess  you'll find almost as many things can happen in a submarine as can in  an auto,\" and future events were to prove the young inventor to be  right.    Everything worked well that night, and the ship made good progress.  They rose to the surface the next morning to make sure of their  position, and to get fresh air, though they did not really need the  latter, as the reserve supply had not been drawn on, and was sufficient  for several days, now that the oxygen machine had been put in running  order.    On the second day the ship was sent to the bottom and halted there, as  Mr. Swift wished to try the new diving suits. These were made of a new,  light, but very strong metal to withstand the pressure of a great depth.    Tom, Mr. Sharp and Captain Weston donned the suits, the others agreeing  to wait until they saw how the first trial resulted. Then, too, it was  necessary for some one acquainted with the machinery to remain in the  ship to operate the door and water chamber through which the divers had  to pass to get out.    The usual plan, with some changes, was followed in letting the three  out of the boat, and on to the bottom of the sea.  They entered a  chamber in the side of the submarine, water was gradually admitted  until it equaled in pressure that outside, then an outer door was  opened by means of levers, and they could step out.    It was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#14)"],[1,"the window. A little cry burst  from Flavia, as she sprang back from me. My half-finished sentence died  on my lips. Sapt stood there, bowing low, but with a stern frown on his  face.    \"A thousand pardons, sire,\" said he, \"but his Eminence the Cardinal has  waited this quarter of an hour to offer his respectful adieu to your  Majesty.\"    I met his eye full and square; and I read in it an angry warning. How  long he had been a listener I knew not, but he had come in upon us in  the nick of time.    \"We must not keep his Eminence waiting,\" said I.    But Flavia, in whose love there lay no shame, with radiant eyes and  blushing face, held out her hand to Sapt. She said nothing, but no  man could have missed her meaning, who had ever seen a woman in the  exultation of love. A sour, yet sad, smile passed over the old soldier's  face, and there was tenderness in his voice, as bending to kiss her  hand, he said:    \"In joy and sorrow, in good times and bad, God save your Royal  Highness!\"    He paused and added, glancing at me and drawing himself up to military  erectness:    \"But, before all comes the King--God save the King!\"    And Flavia caught at my hand and kissed it, murmuring:    \"Amen! Good God, Amen!\"    We went into the ballroom again. Forced to receive adieus, I was  separated from Flavia: everyone, when they left me, went to her. Sapt  was out and in of the throng, and where he had been, glances, smiles,  and whispers were rife. I doubted not that, true to his relentless  purpose, he was spreading the news that he had learnt. To uphold  the Crown and beat Black Michael--that was his one resolve. Flavia,  myself--ay, and the real King in Zenda, were pieces in his game; and  pawns have no business with passions. Not even at the walls of the  Palace did he stop; for when at last I handed Flavia down the broad  marble steps and into her carriage, there was a great crowd awaiting  us, and we were welcomed with deafening cheers. What could I do? Had I  spoken then, they would have refused to believe that I was not the King;  they might have believed that the King had run mad. By Sapt's devices  and my own ungoverned passion I had been forced on, and the way back had  closed behind me; and the passion still drove me in the same direction  as the devices seduced me. I faced all Strelsau that night as the King  and the accepted suitor of the Princess Flavia.    At last, at three in the morning, when the cold light of dawning day  began to steal in, I was in my dressing-room, and Sapt alone was with  me. I sat like a man dazed, staring into the fire; he puffed at his  pipe; Fritz was gone to bed, having almost refused to speak to me. On  the table by me lay a rose; it had been in Flavia's dress, and, as we  parted, she had kissed it and given it to me.    Sapt advanced his hand towards the rose, but, with a quick movement, I  shut mine down upon it.    \"That's mine,\" I said, \"not yours--nor the King's either.\"    \"We struck a good blow for the King tonight,\" said he.    I turned on him fiercely.    \"What's to prevent me striking a blow for myself?\" I said.    He nodded his head.    \"I know what's in your mind,\" he said. \"Yes, lad; but you're bound in  honour.\"    \"Have you left me any honour?\"    \"Oh, come, to play a little trick on a girl--\"    \"You can spare me that. Colonel Sapt, if you would not have me utterly a  villain--if you would not have your King rot in Zenda, while Michael and  I play for the great stake outside--You follow me?\"    \"Ay, I follow you.\"    \"We must act, and quickly! You saw tonight--you heard--tonight--\"    \"I did,\" said he.    \"Your cursed acuteness told you what I should do. Well, leave me here a  week--and there's another problem for you. Do you find the answer?\"    \"Yes, I find it,\" he answered, frowning heavily. \"But if you did that,  you'd have to fight me first--and kill me.\"    \"Well, and if I had--or a score of men? I tell you, I could raise all  Strelsau on you in an hour, and choke you with your lies--yes, your mad  lies--in your mouth.\"    \"It's gospel truth,\" he said--\"thanks to my advice you could.\"    \"I could marry the princess, and send Michael and his brother together  to--\"    \"I'm not denying it, lad,\" said he.    \"Then, in God's name,\" I cried, stretching out my hands to him, \"let us  go to Zenda and crush this Michael and bring the King back to his own  again.\" The old fellow stood and looked at me for full a minute.    \"And the princess?\" he said.    I bowed my head to meet my hands, and crushed the rose between my  fingers and my lips.    I felt his hand on my shoulder, and his voice sounded husky as he  whispered low in my ear:    \"Before God, you're the finest Elphberg of them all. But I have eaten  of the King's bread, and I am the King's servant. Come, we will go to  Zenda!\"    And I looked up and caught him by the hand. And the eyes of both of us  were wet.          CHAPTER 11    Hunting a Very Big Boar      The terrible temptation which was assailing me will now be understood.  I would so force Michael's hand that he must kill the King. I was in a  position to bid him defiance and tighten my grasp on the crown--not for  its own sake, but because the King of Ruritania was to wed the Princess  Flavia. What of Sapt and Fritz? Ah! but a man cannot be held to write  down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when  an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them. Yet, unless  he sets up as a saint, he need not hate himself for them. He is better  employed, as it humbly seems to me, in giving thanks that power to  resist was vouchsafed to him, than in fretting over wicked impulses  which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the  weakness of our nature.    It was a fine bright morning when I walked, unattended, to the  princess's house, carrying a nosegay in my hand. Policy made excuses  for love, and every attention that I paid her, while it riveted my own  chains, bound closer to me the people of the great city, who worshipped  her. I found Fritz's _inamorata_, the Countess Helga, gathering blooms in  the garden for her mistress's wear, and prevailed on her to take mine in  their place. The girl was rosy with happiness, for Fritz, in his turn,  had not wasted his evening, and no dark shadow hung over his wooing,  save the hatred which the Duke of Strelsau was known to bear him.    \"And that,\" she said, with a mischievous smile, \"your Majesty has made  of no moment. Yes, I will take the flowers; shall I tell you, sire, what  is the first thing the princess does with them?\"    We were talking on a broad terrace that ran along the back of the house,  and a window above our heads stood open.    \"Madame!\" cried the countess merrily, and Flavia herself looked out. I  bared my head and bowed. She wore a white gown, and her hair was loosely  gathered in a knot. She kissed her hand to me, crying:    \"Bring the King up, Helga; I'll give him some coffee.\"    The countess, with a gay glance, led the way, and took me into Flavia's  morning-room. And, left alone, we greeted one another as lovers are  wont. Then the princess laid two letters before me. One was from Black  Michael--a most courteous request that she would honour him by spending  a day at his Castle of Zenda, as had been her custom once a year in the  summer, when the place and its gardens were in the height of their great  beauty. I threw the letter down in disgust, and Flavia laughed at me.  Then, growing grave again, she pointed to the other sheet.    \"I don't know who that comes from,\" she said. \"Read it.\"    I knew in a moment. There was no signature at all this time, but the  handwriting was the same as that which had told me of the snare in the  summer-house: it was Antoinette de Mauban's.    \"I have no cause to love you,\" it ran, \"but God forbid that you should  fall into the power of the duke. Accept no invitations of his. Go  nowhere without a large guard--a regiment is not too much to make you  safe. Show this, if you can, to him who reigns in Strelsau.\"    \"Why doesn't it say 'the King'?\" asked Flavia, leaning over my shoulder,  so that the ripple of her hair played on my cheek. \"Is it a hoax?\"    \"As you value life, and more than life, my queen,\" I said, \"obey it to  the very letter. A regiment shall camp round your house today. See that  you do not go out unless well guarded.\"    \"An order, sire?\" she asked, a little rebellious.    \"Yes, an order, madame--if you love me.\"    \"Ah!\" she cried; and I could not but kiss her.    \"You know who sent it?\" she asked.    \"I guess,\" said I. \"It is from a good friend--and I fear, an unhappy  woman. You must be ill, Flavia, and unable to go to Zenda. Make your  excuses as cold and formal as you like.\"    \"So you feel strong enough to anger Michael?\" she said, with a proud  smile.    \"I'm strong enough for anything, while you are safe,\" said I.    Soon I tore myself away from her, and then, without consulting Sapt, I  took my way to the house of Marshal Strakencz. I had seen something  of the old general, and I liked and trusted him. Sapt was less  enthusiastic, but I had learnt by now that Sapt was best pleased when  he could do everything, and jealousy played some part in his views. As  things were now, I had more work than Sapt and Fritz could manage, for  they must come with me to Zenda, and I wanted a man to guard what I  loved most in all the world, and suffer me to set about my task of  releasing the King with a quiet mind.    The Marshal received me with most loyal kindness. To some extent, I took  him into my confidence. I charged him with the care of the princess,  looking him full and significantly in the face as I bade him let no one  from her cousin the duke approach her, unless he himself were there and  a dozen of his men with him.    \"You may be right, sire,\" said he, shaking his grey head sadly. \"I have  known better men than the duke do worse things than that for love.\"    I could quite"]]]
