On the other hand, official returns of criminal statistics, and a  majority of the members of the Central Commission, when pursuing  an inquiry suggested by myself into Italian crime since 1873  <p 67>--for previously to this date there are no criminal  statistics in Italy except for 1853 and 1869-70--came to the  conclusion that there was a tendency towards a diminution of  crime.  But their decision was formed from an entirely partial  standpoint, which they had taken up in the exigency of polemical  discussion.  They compared, in fact, the years just concluded,  1881-5, with 1880, and thus it naturally followed that after a  maximum they had a relative decrease.  And it was only this  ingenious comparison which gave an appearance of actual proof to  their optimistic assertions; for when a fever is at forty degrees,  the fall of even half a degree is very important.  They paid  special attention to the so-called high criminality, which is  tried by the Assize courts, and is actually decreasing, though by  the purely artificial effect of more and more effective measures  of correction.  But I have always maintained, and I have the  support of M. Oettingen, that we cannot separate crimes and  offences tried by the Assizes from those tried by the Tribunals,  for there is only a difference of degree between them, as is clear  in regard to theft, assaults and wounding, forgery and the like.    It is a curious fact that similar illusions have existed in all  countries through the same causes and prejudices which have been  mentioned above.  In France, for instance, we often find that the  keepers of the seals, reporting on volumes of the excellent and  valuable series of criminal statistics since the year 1826,  occasionally remark on these oscillatory diminutions, and make a  point of treating them as <p 68>signs of a constant and general  tendency, which succeeding years have always contradicted.    In France also, the same controversy has been kept up since 1840,  with the same polemical artifices as were employed more recently  in Italy, on the question whether crime has increased or  decreased.  Dufau, B<e'>ranger, Berrzat de St. Prix, and Legoyt  affirmed that it had diminished since 1826, against the true  opinion of de Metz, Dupin, Chassan, Mesuard, and Fayet, the last  of whom quotes the others in one of his essays on criminal  statistics, now undeservedly forgotten, though they abound in  striking and profound observation.    But, as for France in those days, so for Italy to-day, the  statistics of succeeding years quickly proved that what official  optimism and national self-complacency spoke of as pessimism on  our part was but a conscientious inference from lamentable facts,  established in every country by the influence of civilisation on  crime, which I have described in preceding pages.    After these general statements we ought logically to watch the  periodic movement of each leading category of crimes and offences  in each division of the country; for not all crimes, nor all  districts, pursue the same course from year to year.  But as this  inquiry is impossible in the present work, we may pass on to the  general figures for other European countries.

'' contraventions   ......  100 113)        The most constant general fact shown by these data is in all cases  the very remarkable increase of slighter delinquencies, side by  side with constancy or <p 70>slight diminution in crimes against  the person, and a large diminution in crime against property.  This is seen in France, England, Belgium, whilst there is an  increase both of crimes and offences in Austria.    Behind the general fact, however, we must distinguish between the  actual and the apparent.    On the one hand, the decrease of more serious crime against  property is simply due to prisoners electing to be sentenced by  the inferior court, which is at the discretion of the Tribunals in  France, but legally established in Belgium, by the laws of 1838  and 1848, and in England by the Acts of 1856 and 1878--an election  of the slighter but more certain punishment of the magistrates in  preference to going before a jury.  Indeed, crimes against the  person, in which there is less power of election, do not exhibit  so marked a decrease; and accordingly we see that in Belgium the  increase of ``correctionalised'' crimes is due far more to crimes  against property (62 per cent in 36 years) than to those against  the person (9 per cent.).    On the other hand, the growth of slighter delinquency is partly  the effect of special enactments, which are constantly creating  new infractions, offences or contraventions.  For France may be  mentioned the law of 1832 on eluding supervision, that of 1844 on  the game laws, that of 1857 on the false description of goods for  sale, of 1845 on railway offences, of 1849 on the expulsion of  refugees, of 1873 on drunkenness, and of 1874 on requisition of  horses.  I dealt with the statistical results of these laws, and  with the influence of the increasing number of police  <p 71>agents, in my ``Studies on Criminality in France'' (Rome,  1881); and I will here add only a single observation.  If it is  true, as M. Joly says, that other laws, passed since 1826, have  extinguished a few offences, or at least have diminished their  frequency under less severe regulations, yet it is also true that  the new infractions created in the past half-century show far  higher numbers than those of the infractions which have been  extinguished or rendered less easy.  So that amongst the 297 per  cent. of increase on the offences tried in France between 1826 and  1887, the element due to legal creation of new infractions must  not be ignored.    It cannot, however, be denied that for certain more frequent  offences we have a real and very noteworthy increase, apart from  any legislative or statistical cause of disturbance.    The same observation may be made in regard to England.  There also  the increase of 76 per cent, during thirty years of offences tried  summarily is due in part to new infractions, created by special  legislation, and especially by the Education Act of 1873, under  which there were more than forty thousand infractions in 1878, and  more than sixty-five thousand in 1886.    In regard to this delinquency in England (wherein are included,  over and above real offences, certain infractions corresponding to  the police contraventions of the Italian, French, Belgian and  Austrian codes) it is to be observed that the increase of 76 per  cent. in thirty years is due rather to contraventions than to  offences.  And this would establish a remarkable <p 72>difference  between the variations of delinquency in England and in France.    If we analyse the record of infractions tried summarily in  England, we find that contraventions of the law in respect of  drunkenness account for most of this increase (from 82,196 in 1861  to 183,221 in 1885 and 165,139 in 1886).  On the other hand,  offences against the person (assaults) and against property  (stealing, larceny, malicious offences) have not shown so large an  increase.    In fact, if we compare the variations in assaults and thefts in  France and England, we have the following figures:--    ENGLAND.                                          1861-3. 1879-81.

It was very dark, but we traveled toward the noise,  and when we drew near the Indian camp quite a number of large Indian  dogs came out to meet us. They smelled us, but did not bark or bite.  Soon we were surrounded by Osage Indians, and were kindly received by  Mr. Jereu and his wife who was an Indian. She gave us an excellent  supper and a good bed, which we were thankful for after the fatigue of  the day.    \"As I laid my head upon my pillow, I felt to thank God from the  bottom of my heart for the exchange from the barbarous treatment of  a civilized Presbyterian priest to the humane, kind, and generous  treatment of the savage Osage Indians. May God reward them both  according to their deserts!    \"We arose in the morning, after a good night's rest. I was somewhat  lame, from wading in the swamp the night before. {49} We had a good  breakfast. Mr. Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the river, and  informed us that it was sixty miles to the nearest settlement of either  white or red men.    \"We were too bashful to ask for anything to take with us to eat; so  we crossed the river and started on our day's journey of sixty miles  without a morsel of food of any kind. We started about sunrise and  crossed a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level as a house floor,  without shrub or water. We arrived at timber about two o'clock in the  afternoon.    \"As we approached the timber, a large black bear came out towards us.  We were not afraid of him, for we were on the Lord's business, and had  not mocked God's prophets as did the forty-two wicked children who said  to Elisha, 'Go up thou bald head,' for which they were torn by bears.  When the bear got within eight rods of us he sat on his haunches,  looked at us a moment, and ran away; and we went on our way rejoicing.    \"We had to travel in the night, which was cloudy and very dark, so we  had great difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large drove of wolves  gathered around, and followed us. They came very close, and at times it  seemed as though they would eat us up. We had materials for striking a  light, and at ten o'clock, not knowing where we were, and the wolves  becoming so bold, we thought it wisdom to make a fire; so we stopped  and gathered a lot of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and lit them,  and as our fire began to burn the wolves left us.    \"As we were about to lay down on the ground--for we had no blankets--we  heard a dog bark. My companion said it was a wolf; I said it was a  dog; but soon we heard a cowbell. Then we each took a firebrand, went  about a quarter of a mile, and found the house, which was sixty miles  from where we started that morning. It was an old log cabin, about  twelve feet square, with no door, but an old blanket was hung up in the  door-way. There was no furniture except one bedstead, upon which lay a  woman, several children, and several small dogs.    \"A man lay on the bare floor with his feet to the fireplace, and all  were asleep. I went in and spoke to the man, but did not wake him. I  stepped up to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder. The moment he felt  the weight of my hand he jumped to his feet and ran around the room as  though he were {50} frightened; but he was quieted when we informed him  we were friends. The cause of his fright was that he had shot a panther  a few nights before, and he thought its mate had jumped upon him. He  asked us what we wanted; we told him we wished to stop with him all  night, and would like something to eat. He informed us we might lie  on the floor as he did, but that he had not a mouthful for us to eat,  as he had to depend on his gun to get breakfast for his family in the  morning. So we lay on the bare floor, and slept through a long, rainy  night, which was pretty hard after walking sixty miles without anything  to eat. That was the hardest day's work of my life. The man's name was  Williams. He was in the mob in Jackson County; and after the Saints  were driven out, he, with many others, went south.    \"We got up in the morning and walked in the rain twelve miles to the  house of a man named Bemon, who was also one of the mob from Jackson  County. The family were about to sit down to breakfast as we came in.  In those days it was the custom of the Missourians to ask you to eat  even though they were hostile to you; so he asked us to take breakfast,  and we were very glad of the invitation. He knew we were Mormons; and  as soon as we began to eat, he began to swear about the Mormons. He had  a large platter of bacon and eggs, and plenty of bread on the table,  and his swearing did not hinder our eating, for the harder he swore the  harder we ate, until we got our stomachs full; then we arose from the  table, took our hats, and thanked him for our breakfast. The last we  heard of him he was still swearing. I trust the Lord will reward him  for our breakfast.    \"In the early days of the Church, it was a great treat to an elder in  his travels through the country to find a Mormon; it was so with us. We  were hardly in Arkansas when we heard of a family named Akeman. They  were in Jackson County in the persecutions. Some of the sons had been  tied up there and whipped on their bare backs, with hickory switches,  by the mob. We heard of their living on Petit Jean River, in the  Arkansas Territory, and we went a long way to visit them.    \"Recently there had been heavy rains, and a creek that we had to cross  was swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods in width. There was no  person living nearer than two miles from the crossing, and no boat. The  people living at the last house {51} on the road, some three miles from  the crossing said we would have to tarry till the water fell before  we could cross. Feeling to trust in God, we did not stop. Just as we  arrived at the rolling flood, a negro, on a powerful horse, entered the  stream on the opposite side and rode through it. On making our wants  known to him, he took us, one at a time, behind him and carried us  safely over, and we went on our way rejoicing.    \"We arrived that night within five miles of Mr. Akeman's, and were  kindly entertained by a stranger. During the night I had the following  dream: I thought an angel came to us, and told us we were commanded of  the Lord to follow a certain straight path, which was pointed out to  us, let it lead us wherever it might. After we had walked in it awhile  we came to the door of a house, which was in the line of a high wall  running north and south, so that we could not go around. I opened the  door and saw the room was filled with large serpents, and I shuddered  at the sight. My companion said he would not go into the room for fear  of the serpents. I told him I would try to go through the room though  they killed me, for the Lord commanded it. As I stepped into the room  the serpents coiled themselves up, and raised their heads some two  feet from the floor, to spring at me. There was one much larger than  the rest, in the center of the room, which raised his head nearly as  high as mine and made a spring at me. At that instant I felt as though  nothing but the power of God could save me, and I stood still. Just  before the serpent reached me he dropped dead at my feet; all the  rest dropped dead, swelled up, turned black, bust open, took fire and  were consumed before my eyes, and we went through the room unharmed,  thanking God for our deliverance.    \"I awoke in the morning and pondered upon the dream. We took breakfast,  and started on our journey on Sunday morning to visit Mr. Akeman. I  related to my companion my dream, and told him we should see something  strange. We had great anticipations of meeting Mr. Akeman, supposing  him to be a member of the Church. When we arrived at his house, he  received us very coldly, and we soon found that he had apostatized.  He brought railing accusations against the Book of Mormon and the  authorities of the Church.    \"Word was sent through all the settlements on the river for {52} twenty  miles that two Mormon preachers were in the place. A mob was soon  raised, and warning sent to us to leave immediately or we would be  tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail, and hanged. I soon saw who the  serpents were. My companion wanted to leave; I told him, no. I would  stay and see my dream fulfilled.    \"There was an old gentleman and lady named Hubbel, who had read the  Book of Mormon and believed. Father Hubbel came to see us, and invited  us to make our home with him while we stayed in the place. We did so,  and labored for him some three weeks with our axes, clearing land,  while we were waiting to see the salvation of God.    \"February 14th, 1835, was an important day to me. In company with  Brother Brown, I took my axe went into the woods to help Brother  Hubbel clear some land. We chopped till 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  The spirit of the Lord came upon me like a rushing of mighty wind.  The voice of the spirit said, 'Go up again and visit Mr. Akeman and  again bear testimony to him of the truth of the Book of Mormon and of  the work of God.' I marveled at this and told Brother Brown what the  spirit said to me. He replied that I might go if I wished to do so,  but that he would not go. I carried my ax to the house and walked up  to Mr. Akeman's about one and a half miles through a pleasant grove.  While on my way I reflected upon this strange operation of the spirit  within me. I was in a deep, gloomy frame of mind and thought. As I  approached the house I saw the door open and Mr. Akeman walking the  floor. I felt particularly impressed to ask if he was well. He said he  never felt better in health. I told him I had come to bear testimony  again to him of the truth of the Book of Mormon and of the work of God  and of the danger of opposing that work. He was soon filled with wrath  and indignation and he opposed me in the strongest terms and raged "]]]
