[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#14)"],[1,"     _Chapter 3_    The Easter term was nearing its end. Football, with the exception of  the final House-match, which had still to come off, was over, and life  was in consequence a trifle less exhilarating than it might have been.  In some ways the last few weeks before the Easter holidays are quite  pleasant. You can put on running shorts and a blazer and potter about  the grounds, feeling strong and athletic, and delude yourself into the  notion that you are training for the sports. Ten minutes at the broad  jump, five with the weight, a few sprints on the track--it is all very  amusing and harmless, but it is apt to become monotonous after a time.  And if the weather is at all inclined to be chilly, such an occupation  becomes impossible.    Charteris found things particularly dull. He was a fair average runner,  but there were others far better at every distance, so that he saw no  use in mortifying the flesh with strict training. On the other hand, in  view of the fact that the final House-match had yet to be played, and  that Merevale's was one of the two teams that were going to play it, it  behoved him to keep himself at least moderately fit. The genial muffin  and the cheery crumpet were still things to be avoided. He thus found  himself in a position where, apparently, the few things which it was  possible for him to do were barred, and the net result was that he felt  slightly dull.    To make matters worse, all the rest of his set were working full time  at their various employments, and had no leisure for amusing him. Welch  practised hundred-yard sprints daily, and imagined that it would be  quite a treat for Charteris to be allowed to time him. So he gave him  the stopwatch, saw him safely to the end of the track, and at a given  signal dashed off in the approved American style. By the time he  reached the tape, dutifully held by two sporting Merevalian juniors,  Charteris's attention had generally been attracted elsewhere. 'What  time?' Welch would pant. 'By Jove,' Charteris would observe blandly, 'I  forgot to look. About a minute and a quarter, I fancy.' At which Welch,  who always had a notion that he had done it in ten and a fifth  _that_ time, at any rate, would dissemble his joy, and mildly  suggest that somebody else should hold the watch. Then there was Jim  Thomson, generally a perfect mine of elevating conversation. He was in  for the mile and also the half, and refused to talk about anything  except those distances, and the best methods for running them in the  minimum of time. Charteris began to feel a blue melancholy stealing  over him. The Babe, again. He might have helped to while away the long  hours, but unfortunately the Babe had been taken very bad with a notion  that he was going to win the 'cross-country run, and when, in addition  to this, he was seized with a panic with regard to the prospects of the  House team in the final, and began to throw out hints concerning strict  training, Charteris regarded him as a person to be avoided. If he fled  to the Babe for sympathy now, the Babe would be just as likely as not  to suggest that he should come for a ten-mile spin with him, to get him  into condition for the final Houser. The very thought of a ten-mile  spin made Charteris feel faint. Lastly, there was Tony. But Tony's  company was worse than none at all. He went about with his arm in a  sling, and declined to be comforted. But for his injury, he would by  now have been training hard for the Aldershot Boxing Competition, and  the fact that he was now definitely out of it had a very depressing  effect upon him. He lounged moodily about the gymnasium, watching  Menzies, who was to take his place, sparring with the instructor, and  refused consolation. Altogether, Charteris found life a distinct bore.    He was reduced to such straits for amusement, that one Wednesday  afternoon, finding himself with nothing else to do, he was working at a  burlesque and remarkably scurrilous article on 'The Staff, by one who  has suffered', which he was going to insert in _The Glow Worm_, an  unofficial periodical which he had started for the amusement of the  School and his own and his contributors' profit. He was just warming to  his work, and beginning to enjoy himself, when the door opened without  a preliminary knock. Charteris deftly slid a piece of blotting-paper  over his MS., for Merevale occasionally entered a study in this manner.  And though there was nothing about Merevale himself in the article, it  would be better perhaps, thought Charteris, if he did not see it. But  it was not Merevale. It was somebody far worse. The Babe.    The Babe was clothed as to his body in football clothes, and as to  face, in a look of holy enthusiasm. Charteris knew what that look  meant. It meant that the Babe was going to try and drag him out for a  run.    'Go away, Babe,' he said, 'I'm busy.'    'Why on earth are you slacking in here on this ripping afternoon?'    'Slacking!' said Charteris. 'I like that. I'm doing berrain work, Babe.  I'm writing an article on masters and their customs, which will cause a  profound sensation in the Common Room. At least it would, if they ever  saw it, but they won't. Or I hope they won't for their sake _and_  mine. So run away, my precious Babe, and don't disturb your uncle when  he's busy.'    'Rot,' said the Babe firmly, 'you haven't taken any exercise for a  week.'    Charteris replied proudly that he had wound up his watch only last  night. The Babe refused to accept the remark as relevant to the matter  in hand.    'Look here, Alderman,' he said, sitting down on the table, and gazing  sternly at his victim, 'it's all very well, you know, but the final  comes on in a few days, and you know you aren't in any too good  training.'    'I am,' said Charteris, 'I'm as fit as a prize fighter. Simply full of  beans. Feel my ribs.'    The Babe declined the offer.    'No, but I say,' he said plaintively, 'I wish you'd treat it seriously.  It's getting jolly serious, really. If Dacre's win that cup again this  year, that'll make four years running.'    'Not so,' said Charteris, like the mariner of  infinite-resource-and-sagacity; 'not so, but far otherwise. It'll only  make three.'    'Well, three's bad enough.'    'True, oh king, three is quite bad enough.'    'Well, then, there you are. Now you see.'    Charteris looked puzzled.    'Would you mind explaining that remark?' he said. 'Slowly.'    But the Babe had got off the table, and was prowling round the room,  opening cupboards and boxes.    'What are you playing at?' enquired Charteris.    'Where do you keep your footer things?'    'What do you want with my footer things, if you don't mind my asking?'    'I'm going to help you put them on, and then you're coming for a run.'    'Ah,' said Charteris.    'Yes. Just a gentle spin to keep you in training. Hullo, this looks  like them.'    He plunged both hands into a box near the window and flung out a mass  of football clothes. It reminded Charteris of a terrier digging at a  rabbit-hole.    He protested.    'Don't, Babe. Treat 'em tenderly. You'll be spoiling the crease in  those bags if you heave 'em about like that. I'm very particular about  how I look on the football field. _I_ was always taught to dress  myself like a little gentleman, so to speak. Well, now you've seen  them, put 'em away.'    'Put 'em on,' said the Babe firmly.    'You are a beast, Babe. I don't want to go for a run. I'm getting too  old for violent exercise.'    'Buck up,' said the Babe. 'We mustn't chuck any chances away. Now that  Tony can't play, we shall have to do all we know if we want to win.'    'I don't see what need there is to get nervous about it. Considering  we've got three of the First three-quarter line, and the Second Fifteen  back, we ought to do pretty well.'    'But look at Dacre's scrum. There's Prescott, to start with. He's worth  any two of our men put together. Then they've got Carter, Smith, and  Hemming out of the first, and Reeve-Jones out of the second. And their  outsides aren't so very bad, if you come to think of it. Bannister's in  the first, and the other three-quarters are all good. And they've got  both the second halves. You'll have practically to look after both of  them now that Tony's crocked. And Baddeley has come on a lot this  term.'    'Babe,' said Charteris, 'you have reason. I will turn over a new leaf.  I _will_ be good. Give me my things and I'll come for a run. Only  please don't let it be anything over twenty miles.'    'Good man,' said the gratified Babe. 'We won't go far, and will take it  quite easy.'    'I tell you what,' said Charteris. 'Do you know a place called Worbury?  I thought you wouldn't, probably. It's only a sort of hamlet, two  cottages, three public-houses, and a duck-pond, and that sort of thing.  I only know it because Welch and I ran there once last year. It's in  the Badgwick direction, about three miles by road, mostly along the  level. I vote we muffle up fairly well, blazers and sweaters and so on,  run to Worbury, tea at one of the cottages, and back in time for  lock-up. How does that strike you?'    'It sounds all right. How about tea though? Are you certain you can get  it?'    'Rather. The Oldest Inhabitant is quite a pal of mine.'    Charteris's circle of acquaintances was a standing wonder to the Babe  and other Merevalians. He seemed to know everybody in the county.    When once he was fairly started on any business, physical or mental,  Charteris generally shaped well. It was the starting that he found the  difficulty. Now that he was actually in motion, he was enjoying himself  thoroughly. He wondered why on earth he had been so reluctant to come  for this run. The knowledge that there were three miles to go, and that  he was equal to them, made him feel a new man. He felt fit. And there  is nothing like feeling fit for dispelling boredom. He swung along with  the Babe at a steady pace.    'There's the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#14)"],[1,"pane.    'I suppose he tried that window first, before going round to the  other?' hazarded Mr Thompson.    'Yes. Most probably. Broke it, and then remembered that anyone at the  windows of the boarding Houses might see him, so left his job half  done, and shifted his point of action. I think so. Yes.'    He moved on again till he came to the other window. Then he gave vent  to an excited exclamation, and picked up a piece of caked mud from the  sill as carefully as if it were some fragile treasure.    'Now, see this,' he said. 'This was wet when the robbery was done. The  man brought it in with him. On his boot. Left it on the sill as he  climbed in. Got out in a hurry, startled by something--you can see he  was startled and left in a hurry from the different values of the cups  he took--and as he was going, put his hand on this. Left a clear  impression. Good as plaster of Paris very nearly.'    Mr Thompson looked at the piece of mud, and there, sure enough, was the  distinct imprint of the palm of a hand. He could see the larger of the  lines quite clearly, and under a magnifying-glass there was no doubt  that more could be revealed.    He drew in a long breath of satisfaction and excitement.    'Yes,' said the detective. 'That piece of mud couldn't prove anything  by itself, but bring it up at the end of a long string of evidence, and  if it fits your man, it convicts him as much as a snap-shot photograph  would. Morning, sir. I must be going.' And he retired, carrying the  piece of mud in his hand, leaving Mr Thompson in the full grip of the  detective-fever, hunting with might and main for more clues.    After some time, however, he was reluctantly compelled to give up the  search, for the bell rang for dinner, and he always lunched, as did  many of the masters, in the Great Hall. During the course of the meal  he exercised his brains without pause in the effort to discover a  fitting suspect. Did he know of any victim of kleptomania in the  School? No, he was sorry to say he did not. Was anybody in urgent need  of money? He could not say. Very probably yes, but he had no means of  knowing.    After lunch he went back to the Common Room. There was a letter lying  on the table. He picked it up. It was addressed to 'J. Thomson, St  Austin's.' Now Mr Thompson's Christian name was John. He did not notice  the omission of the _p_ until he had opened the envelope and  caught a glimpse of the contents. The letter was so short that only a  glimpse was needed, and it was not till he had read the whole that he  realized that it was somebody else's letter that he had opened.    This was the letter:    'Dear Jim--Frantic haste. Can you let me have that two pounds directly  you come back? Beg, borrow, or steal it. I simply must have it.--Yours  ever,    Allen.'          [11]    THE SPORTS      Sports weather at St Austin's was as a rule a quaint but unpleasant  solution of mud, hail, and iced rain. These were taken as a matter of  course, and the School counted it as something gained when they were  spared the usual cutting east wind.    This year, however, occurred that invaluable exception which is so  useful in proving rules. There was no gale, only a gentle breeze. The  sun was positively shining, and there was a general freshness in the  air which would have made a cripple cast away his crutches, and, after  backing himself heavily both ways, enter for the Strangers' Hundred  Yards.    Jim had wandered off alone. He was feeling too nervous at the thought  of the coming mile and all it meant to him to move in society for the  present. Charteris, Welch, and Tony, going out shortly before lunch to  inspect the track, found him already on the spot, and in a very low  state of mind.    'Hullo, you chaps,' he said dejectedly, as they came up.    'Hullo.'    'Our James is preoccupied,' said Charteris. 'Why this jaundiced air,  Jim? Look at our other Thompson over there.'    'Our other Thompson' was at that moment engaged in conversation with  the Headmaster at the opposite side of the field.    'Look at him,' said Charteris, 'prattling away as merrily as a little  che-ild to the Old Man. You should take a lesson from him.'    'Look here, I say,' said Jim, after a pause, 'I believe there's  something jolly queer up between Thompson and the Old Man, and I  believe it's about me.'    'What on earth makes you think that?' asked Welch.    'It's his evil conscience,' said Charteris. 'No one who hadn't  committed the awful crime that Jim has, could pay the least attention  to anything Thompson said. What does our friend Thucydides remark on  the subject?--       '\"_Conscia mens recti, nec si sinit esse dolorem     Sed revocare gradum_.\"    Very well then.'    'But why should you think anything's up?' asked Tony.    'Perhaps nothing is, but it's jolly fishy. You see Thompson and the Old  'Un pacing along there? Well, they've been going like that for about  twenty minutes. I've been watching them.'    'But you can't tell they're talking about you, you rotter,' said Tony.  'For all you know they may be discussing the exams.'    'Or why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings,' put in  Charteris.    'Or anything,' added Welch profoundly.    'Well, all I know is that Thompson's been doing all the talking, and  the Old Man's been getting more and more riled.'    'Probably Thompson's been demanding a rise of screw or asking for a  small loan or something,' said Charteris. 'How long have you been  watching them?'    'About twenty minutes.'    'From here?'    'Yes.'    'Why didn't you go and join them? There's nothing like tact. If you  were to go and ask the Old Man why the whale wailed or something after  that style it 'ud buck him up like a tonic. I wish you would. And then  you could tell him to tell you all about it and see if you couldn't do  something to smooth the wrinkles from his careworn brow and let the  sunshine of happiness into his heart. He'd like it awfully.'    'Would he!' said Jim grimly. 'Well, I got the chance just now. Thompson  said something to him, and he spun round, saw me, and shouted  \"Thomson\". I went up and capped him, and he was starting to say  something when he seemed to change his mind, and instead of confessing  everything, he took me by the arm, and said, \"No, no, Thomson. Go away.  It's nothing. I will send for you later.\"'    'And did you knock him down?' asked Charteris.    'What happened?' said Welch.    'He gave me a shove as if he were putting the weight, and said again,  \"It's no matter. Go away, Thomson, now.\" So I went.'    'And you've kept an eye on him ever since?' said Charteris. 'Didn't he  seem at all restive?'    'I don't think he noticed me. Thompson had the floor and he was pretty  well full up listening to him.'    'I suppose you don't know what it's all about?' asked Tony.    'Must be this Pavilion business.'    'Now, my dear, sweet cherub,' said Charteris, 'don't you go and make an  utter idiot of yourself and think you're found out and all that sort of  thing. Even if they suspect you they've got to prove it. There's no  sense in your giving them a helping hand in the business. What you've  got to do is to look normal. Don't overdo it or you'll look like a  swashbuckler, and that'll be worse than underdoing it. Can't you make  yourself look less like a convicted forger? For my sake?'    'You really do look a bit off it,' said Welch critically. 'As if you  were sickening for the flu., or something. Doesn't he, Tony?'    'Rather!' said that expert in symptoms. 'You simply must buck up, Jim,  or Drake'll walk away from you.'    'It's disappointing,' said Charteris, 'to find a chap who can crack a  crib as neatly as you can doubling up like this. Think how Charles  Peace would have behaved under the circs. Don't disgrace him, poor  man.'    'Besides,' said Jim, with an attempt at optimism, 'it isn't as if I'd  actually done anything, is it?'    'Just so,' said Charteris, 'that's what I've been trying to get you to  see all along. Keep that fact steadily before you, and you'll be all  right.'    'There goes the lunch-bell,' said Tony. 'You can always tell Merevale's  bell in a crowd. William rings it as if he was doing it for his  health.'    William, also known in criminal circles as the Moke, was the gentleman  who served the House--in a perpetual grin and a suit of livery four  sizes too large for him--as a sort of butler.    'He's an artist,' agreed Charteris, as he listened to the performance.  'Does it as if he enjoyed it, doesn't he? Well, if we don't want to  spoil Merevale's appetite by coming in at half-time, we might be  moving.' They moved accordingly.    The Sports were to begin at two o'clock with a series of hundred-yards  races, which commenced with the 'under twelve' (Cameron of Prater's a  warm man for this, said those who had means of knowing), and culminated  at about a quarter past with the open event, for which Welch was a  certainty. By a quarter to the hour the places round the ropes were  filled, and more visitors were constantly streaming in at the two  entrances to the School grounds, while in the centre of the ring the  band of the local police force--the military being unavailable owing to  exigencies of distance--were seating themselves with the grim  determination of those who know that they are going to play the  soldiers' chorus out of _Faust_. The band at the Sports had played  the soldiers' chorus out of _Faust_ every year for decades past,  and will in all probability play it for decades to come.    The Sports at St Austin's were always looked forward to by everyone  with the keenest interest, and when the day arrived, were as regularly  voted slow. In all school sports there are too many foregone  conclusions. In the present instance everybody knew, and none better  than the competitors themselves, that Welch would win the quarter and  hundred. The high jump was an equal certainty for a boy named Reece in  Halliday's House. Jackson,"]]]
