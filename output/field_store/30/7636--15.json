Joe Bevan stooped down, and examined it in the dim light.    \"What's happened here, sir,\" he said, \"is that there's a plank gone  from the bottom. Smashed clean out, it is. Not started it isn't.  Smashed clean out. That's what it is. Some one must have been here and  done it.\"    Sheen looked at the boat, and saw that he was right. A plank in the  middle had been splintered. It looked as if somebody had driven some  heavy instrument into it. As a matter of fact, Albert had effected the  job with the butt-end of an oar.    The damage was not ruinous. A carpenter could put the thing right at no  great expense. But it would take time. And meanwhile the minutes were  flying, and lock-up was now little more than half an hour away.    \"What'll you do, sir?\" asked Bevan.    That was just what Sheen was asking himself. What could he do? The road  to the school twisted and turned to such an extent that, though the  distance from the \"Blue Boar\" to Seymour's was only a couple of miles  as the crow flies, he would have to cover double that distance unless  he took a short cut across the fields. And if he took a short cut in  the dark he was certain to lose himself. It was a choice of evils. The  \"Blue Boar\" possessed but one horse and trap, and he had seen that  driven away to the station in charge of a fisherman's luggage half an  hour before.    \"I shall have to walk,\" he said.    \"It's a long way. You'll be late, won't you?\" said Mr Bevan.    \"It can't be helped. I suppose I shall. I wonder who smashed that  boat,\" he added after a pause.    Passing through the inn on his way to the road, he made inquiries. It  appeared that two young gentlemen from the school had been there to  tea. They had arrived in a boat and gone away in a boat. Nobody else  had come into the inn. Suspicion obviously rested upon them.    \"Do you remember anything about them?\" asked Sheen.    Further details came out. One of the pair had worn a cap like Sheen's.  The other's headgear, minutely described, showed him that its owner was  a member of the school second eleven.    Sheen pursued the inquiry. He would be so late in any case that a  minute or so more or less would make no material difference; and he was  very anxious to find out, if possible, who it was that had placed him  in this difficulty. He knew that he was unpopular in the school, but he  had not looked for this sort of thing.    Then somebody suddenly remembered having heard one of the pair address  the other by name.    \"What name?\" asked Sheen.    His informant was not sure. Would it be Lindon?    \"Linton,\" said Sheen.    That was it.    Sheen thanked him and departed, still puzzled. Linton, as he knew him,  was not the sort of fellow to do a thing like that. And the other, the  second eleven man, must be Dunstable. They were always about together.  He did not know much about Dunstable, but he could hardly believe that  this sort of thing was his form either. Well, he would have to think of  that later. He must concentrate himself now on covering the distance to  the school in the minimum of time. He looked at his watch. Twenty  minutes more. If he hurried, he might not be so very late. He wished  that somebody would come by in a cart, and give him a lift.    He stopped and listened. No sound of horse's hoof broke the silence. He  walked on again.    Then, faint at first, but growing stronger every instant, there came  from some point in the road far behind him a steady droning sound. He  almost shouted with joy. A motor! Even now he might do it.    But could he stop it? Would the motorist pay any attention to him, or  would he flash past and leave him in the dust? From the rate at which  the drone increased the car seemed to be travelling at a rare speed.    He moved to one side of the road, and waited. He could see the lights  now, flying towards him.    Then, as the car hummed past, he recognised its driver, and put all he  knew into a shout.    \"Bruce!\" he cried.    For a moment it seemed as if he had not been heard. The driver paid not  the smallest attention, as far as he could see. He looked neither to  the left nor to right. Then the car slowed down, and, backing, came  slowly to where he stood.    \"Hullo,\" said the driver, \"who's that?\"    Jack Bruce was alone in the car, muffled to the eyes in an overcoat.  It was more by his general appearance than his face that Sheen had  recognised him.    \"It's me, Sheen. I say, Bruce, I wish you'd give me a lift to  Seymour's, will you?\"    There was never any waste of words about Jack Bruce. Of all the six  hundred and thirty-four boys at Wrykyn he was probably the only one  whose next remark in such circumstances would not have been a question.  Bruce seldom asked questions--never, if they wasted time.    \"Hop in,\" he said.    Sheen consulted his watch again.    \"Lock-up's in a quarter of an hour,\" he said, \"but they give us ten  minutes' grace. That allows us plenty of time, doesn't it?\"    \"Do it in seven minutes, if you like.\"    \"Don't hurry,\" said Sheen. \"I've never been in a motor before, and I  don't want to cut the experience short. It's awfully good of you to  give me a lift.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Bruce.    \"Were you going anywhere? Am I taking you out of your way?\"    \"No. I was just trying the car. It's a new one. The pater's just got  it.\"    \"Do you do much of this?\" said Sheen.    \"Good bit. I'm going in for the motor business when I leave school.\"    \"So all this is training?\"    \"That's it.\"    There was a pause.    \"You seemed to be going at a good pace just now,\" said Sheen.    \"About thirty miles an hour. She can move all right.\"    \"That's faster than you're allowed to go, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You've never been caught, have you?\"    \"Not yet. I want to see how much pace I can get out of her, because  she'll be useful when the election really comes on. Bringing voters to  the poll, you know. That's why the pater bought this new car. It's a  beauty. His other's only a little runabout.\"    \"Doesn't your father mind your motoring?\"    \"Likes it,\" said Jack Bruce.    It seemed to Sheen that it was about time that he volunteered some  information about himself, instead of plying his companion with  questions. It was pleasant talking to a Wrykinian again; and Jack Bruce  had apparently either not heard of the Albert incident, or else he was  not influenced by it in any way.    \"You've got me out of an awful hole, Bruce,\" he began.    \"That's all right. Been out for a walk?\"    \"I'd been to the 'Blue Boar'.\"    \"Oh!\" said Bruce. He did not seem to wish to know why Sheen had been  there.    Sheen proceeded to explain.    \"I suppose you've heard all about me,\" he said uncomfortably. \"About  the town, you know. That fight. Not joining in.\"    \"Heard something about it,\" said Bruce.    \"I went down town again after that,\" said Sheen, \"and met the same  fellows who were fighting Linton and the others. They came for me, and  I was getting awfully mauled when Joe Bevan turned up.\"    \"Oh, is Joe back again?\"    \"Do you know him?\" asked Sheen in surprise.    \"Oh yes. I used to go to the 'Blue Boar' to learn boxing from him all  last summer holidays.\"    \"Did you really? Why, that's what I'm doing now.\"    \"Good man,\" said Bruce.    \"Isn't he a splendid teacher?\"    \"Ripping.\"    \"But I didn't know you boxed, Bruce. You never went in for any of the  School competitions.\"    \"I'm rather a rotten weight. Ten six. Too heavy for the Light-Weights  and not heavy enough for the Middles. Besides, the competitions here  are really inter-house. They don't want day-boys going in for them. Are  you going to box for Seymour's?\"    \"That's what I want to do. You see, it would be rather a score,  wouldn't it? After what's happened, you know.\"    \"I suppose it would.\"    \"I should like to do something. It's not very pleasant,\" he added, with  a forced laugh, \"being considered a disgrace to the house, and cut by  everyone.\"    \"Suppose not.\"    \"The difficulty is Drummond. You see, we are both the same weight, and  he's much better than I am. I'm hoping that he'll go in for the Middles  and let me take the Light-Weights. There's nobody he couldn't beat in  the Middles, though he would be giving away a stone.\"    \"Have you asked him?\"    \"Not yet. I want to keep it dark that I'm learning to box, just at  present.\"    \"Spring it on them suddenly?\"    \"Yes. Of course, I can't let it get about that I go to Joe Bevan,  because I have to break bounds every time I do it.\"    \"The upper river's out of bounds now for boarders, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    Jack Bruce sat in silence for a while, his gaze concentrated on the  road in front of him.    \"Why go by river at all?\" he said at last. \"If you like, I'll run you  to the 'Blue Boar' in the motor every day.\"    \"Oh, I say, that's awfully decent of you,\" said Sheen.    \"I should like to see old Joe again. I think I'll come and spar, too.  If you're learning, what you want more than anything is somebody your  own size to box with.\"    \"That's just what Joe was saying. Will you really? I should be awfully  glad if you would. Boxing with Joe is all right, but you feel all the  time he's fooling with you. I should like to try how I got on with  somebody else.\"    \"You'd better meet me here, then, as soon after school as you can.\"    As he spoke, the car stopped.    \"Where are we?\" asked Sheen.    \"Just at the corner of the road behind the houses.\"    \"Oh, I know. Hullo, there goes the lock-up bell. I shall do it  comfortably.\"    He jumped down.    \"I say, Bruce,\" he said, \"I really am most awfully obliged for the  lift. Something went wrong with my boat, and I couldn't get back in it.  I should have been frightfully in the cart if you hadn't come by.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Jack Bruce. \"I say, Sheen!\"    \"Hullo?\"    \"Are you going to practise in the music-room after morning school  tomorrow?\"    \"Yes. Why?\"    \"I think I'll turn up.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#14)"],[1," which he took to the schoolmaster, and thereby gained himself a  holiday. There is no account of any other wicked use to which he put  his talent. It is said that he could copy any writing that he saw, and  his ready pencil covered all his copy-books with sketches of his  schoolmasters. It was thought better for him finally to follow his own  ideas of education, namely, to roam the woodlands and make beautiful  pictures.    His father's heart was not softened till one day little Gainsborough  brought home a sketch of the orchard into which the head of a man had  thrust itself, painted with great ability. This man was a poacher, and  father Gainsborough recognised him by the portrait. There seemed to be  utility in art of this kind, and before long the boy found himself  apprenticed to a silversmith.    Through the silversmith the artist got admission to an art school and  began his studies; but his master was a dissolute fellow, and before  long the pupil left him.    Gainsborough was born in the town of Sudbury on the River Stour, the  same which inspired another great painter half a century  later. Gainsborough is best known by his portraits, in particular as  the inventor of \"the Gainsborough hat,\" but he was first of all a  truly great landscape painter, and learned his art as Constable did  after him, along the beautiful shores of the river that flowed past  his native town.    The old Black Horse Inn is still to be seen, and it was in the orchard  behind it that he studied nature, the same in which he made the first  of his famous portraits, that of the poacher. It is known to this day  as the portrait of \"Tom Pear-tree.\" That picture was copied on a piece  of wood cut into the shape of a man, and it is in the possession of  Mr. Jackson, who lent it for the exhibition of Gainsborough's work  held at the Grosvenor Gallery, in 1885.    While Thomas was with his first master, by no means a good companion  for a lad of fifteen, he lived a busy, self-respecting life, since he  was devoted to his home and to his parents. Only three years after he  set out to learn his art he married a young lady of Sudbury. The pair  were by no means rich, Gainsborough having only eighteen years of  experience in this world, besides his brush, and a maker of  woolen-crape shrouds for a father--who was not over pleased to have an  artist for a son. The lady had two hundred pounds but this did not  promise a very luxurious living, so they took a house for six pounds a  year, at Ipswich. Thus the two young lovers began their life  together. There was a good deal of romance in the story of his wife,  whose name was supposed to be Margaret Burr. The two hundred pounds  that helped to pay the Ipswich rent did not come from the man accepted  as her father, but from her real father, who was either the Duke of  Bedford, or an exiled prince. This would seem to be just the sort of  story that should surround a great painter and his affairs.    While he lived at Ipswich Gainsborough used to say of himself that he  was \"chiefly in the face-way\" meaning that for the most part he made  portraits. He loved best to paint the scenes of his boyhood, as  Constable afterward did, but he soon found there was more money in  portraits, and so he decided to go to live in Bath, the fashionable  resort of English people in that day, where he was likely to find rich  folk who wanted to see themselves on canvas. He settled down there  with his wife, whom he loved dearly, and his two daughters and at once  began to make money. It is said he painted five hours a day and all  the rest of the time studied music. As the theatre was Corot's  greatest happiness, so did music most delight Gainsborough, and he  could play well on nearly every known instrument; he became so  excellent a musician that he even gave concerts. He had the most  delightful people about him, people who loved art and who appreciated  him, and then there were the other people who paid for having  themselves painted. Altogether it was an ideal situation.    His studio was in the place known as the \"Circus\" at Bath, and people  came and went all day, for it became the fashionable resort for all  the fine folks.    From five guineas for half length portraits, he soon raised his price  to forty; he had charged eight for full length portraits, but now they  went for one hundred. He painted some famous men of the time. The very  thought is inspiring of such a company of geniuses with Gainsborough  in the centre of the group. He painted Laurence Sterne, who wrote \"The  Sentimental Journey,\" and a few other delightful things; also Garrick,  the renowned actor.    Even the encyclopaedia reads thrillingly upon this subject and one can  afford to quote it, with the feeling that the quotation will be read:  \"His house harboured Italian, German, French and English musicians. He  haunted the green room of Palmer's Theatre, and painted gratuitously  the portraits of many of the actors. He gave away his sketches and  landscapes to any one who had taste or assurance enough to ask for  them.\" This sounds royal and exciting.    After that Gainsborough went up to London with plenty of money and  plenty of confidence and instead of six pounds a year for his house,  he paid three hundred pounds, which suggests much more comfort.    There were two other great painters of the time in London, Sir  Benjamin West--an American, by the way--and Sir Joshua Reynolds. West  was court favourite, but Gainsborough too was called upon to paint  royalty, and share West's honours. Reynolds was the favourite of the  town, but he too had to divide honours with Gainsborough when the  latter painted Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke and Sir William  Blackstone.    Notwithstanding, his landscapes, for which he should have been most  famous, did not sell. Everybody approved of them, but it is said they  were returned to him till they \"stood ranged in long lines from his  hall to his painting room\" Gainsborough was a member of the Royal  Academy and also a true Bohemian. He cared little for elegant society,  but made his friends among men of genius of all sorts. He was very  handsome and impulsive, tall and fair, and generous in his ways; but  he had much sorrow on account of one of his daughters, Mary, who  married Fischer, a hautboy player, against her father's wishes. The  girl became demented--at least she had spells of madness.    When Mary Gainsborough married, her father wrote the following letter  to his sister, which shows that he was a man of tender feeling for  those whom he truly loved:    \" ... I had not the least suspicion of the attachment being so long  and deeply seated; and as it was too late for me to alter anything  without being the cause of total unhappiness on both sides, my  consent ... I needs must give ... and accordingly they were married  last Monday and settled for the present in a ready-furnished little  house in Curzon Street, Mayfair ... I can't say I have any reason to  doubt the man's honesty or goodness of heart, as I never heard anyone  speak anything amiss of him, and as to his oddities and temper, she  must learn to like them as she likes his person ... Peggy has been  very unhappy about it, but I endeavour to comfort her.\" Peggy was his  wife.    The abominable Fischer died twenty-years before Mary did--she lived to  be an old, old woman.    Among those whom Gainsborough loved best was the man called Wiltshire  who carried his pictures to and from London. He was a public \"carrier\"  but would never take any money for his services to the artist, because  he loved his work. All he asked was \"a little picture\"--and he got so  many of these, given in purest affection, that he might have gone out  of business as a carrier, had he chosen to sell them. Four of those  little pictures are now very great ones worth thousands of pounds and  known everywhere to fame. They are \"The Parish Clerk,\" \"Portrait of  Quin,\" \"A Landscape with Cattle,\" and \"The Harvest Waggon.\"    We have a good many stories of Gainsborough's bad manners. The artists  of his day tried to treat him with every consideration, but in return  he treated them very badly, especially Sir Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds,  who was then President of the Academy greatly admired Gainsborough but  the latter would not return Sir Joshua's call, and when Reynolds asked  him to paint his portrait for him, Gainsborough undertook it  thanklessly. Sir Joshua left town for Bath for a time, and when he  returned he tried to learn how soon the portrait would be finished,  but Gainsborough would not even reply to his inquiry. There seems to  have been no reason for this behaviour unless it was jealousy, but it  made a most uncomfortable situation between fellow artists.    Gainsborough has told some not very pleasing stories about himself,  but one of them shows us what a knack he had for seeing the comic side  of things, and perhaps for seeing comedy where it never existed. Upon  one occasion he was invited to a friend's house where the family were  in the habit of assembling for prayers, and he had no sooner got  inside, than he began to fear he should laugh, when prayer time came,  at the chaplain. In a rush of shyness he fled, leaving his host to  look for him, till he stumbled over a servant who said that  Mr. Gainsborough had charged him to say he had gone to breakfast at  Salisbury. Even respect for the customs of others could not make him  control himself.    It was through his intimacy with King George's family that his quarrel  with the Royal Academy came about. He had painted the three  princesses--the Princess Royal, Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth, and  these were to be hung at a certain height in Carlton House, but when  he sent the first to the Academy he asked it to be specially hung and  his request was refused. Then he sent a note as follows:    \"He begs pardon for giving them so much trouble, but he has painted  the picture of the"]]]
