[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#14)"],[1," The abrupt change of subject shut the door on any further confidences.    \"Miss Cornelia is a darling, isn't she?\" said Anne.  \"Gilbert and I  were invited to her house to a state tea last week.  You've heard of  groaning tables.\"    \"I seem to recall seeing the expression in the newspaper reports of  weddings,\" said Leslie, smiling.    \"Well, Miss Cornelia's groaned--at least, it creaked--positively.  You  couldn't have believed she would have cooked so much for two ordinary  people.  She had every kind of pie you could name, I think--except  lemon pie.  She said she had taken the prize for lemon pies at the  Charlottetown Exhibition ten years ago and had never made any since for  fear of losing her reputation for them.\"    \"Were you able to eat enough pie to please her?\"    \"_I_ wasn't.  Gilbert won her heart by eating--I won't tell you how  much.  She said she never knew a man who didn't like pie better than  his Bible.  Do you know, I love Miss Cornelia.\"    \"So do I,\" said Leslie.  \"She is the best friend I have in the world.\"    Anne wondered secretly why, if this were so, Miss Cornelia had never  mentioned Mrs. Dick Moore to her.  Miss Cornelia had certainly talked  freely about every other individual in or near Four Winds.    \"Isn't that beautiful?\" said Leslie, after a brief silence, pointing to  the exquisite effect of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the  rock behind them, across a dark green pool at its base.  \"If I had come  here--and seen nothing but just that--I would go home satisfied.\"    \"The effects of light and shadow all along these shores are wonderful,\"  agreed Anne.  \"My little sewing room looks out on the harbor, and I sit  at its window and feast my eyes.  The colors and shadows are never the  same two minutes together.\"    \"And you are never lonely?\" asked Leslie abruptly.  \"Never--when you  are alone?\"    \"No.  I don't think I've ever been really lonely in my life,\" answered  Anne.  \"Even when I'm alone I have real good company--dreams and  imaginations and pretendings.  I LIKE to be alone now and then, just to  think over things and TASTE them.  But I love friendship--and nice,  jolly little times with people.  Oh, WON'T you come to see me--often?  Please do.  I believe,\" Anne added, laughing, \"that you'd like me if  you knew me.\"    \"I wonder if YOU would like ME,\" said Leslie seriously.  She was not  fishing for a compliment.  She looked out across the waves that were  beginning to be garlanded with blossoms of moonlit foam, and her eyes  filled with shadows.    \"I'm sure I would,\" said Anne.  \"And please don't think I'm utterly  irresponsible because you saw me dancing on the shore at sunset.  No  doubt I shall be dignified after a time.  You see, I haven't been  married very long.  I feel like a girl, and sometimes like a child,  yet.\"    \"I have been married twelve years,\" said Leslie.    Here was another unbelievable thing.    \"Why, you can't be as old as I am!\" exclaimed Anne.  \"You must have  been a child when you were married.\"    \"I was sixteen,\" said Leslie, rising, and picking up the cap and jacket  lying beside her.  \"I am twenty-eight now.  Well, I must go back.\"    \"So must I.  Gilbert will probably be home.  But I'm so glad we both  came to the shore tonight and met each other.\"    Leslie said nothing, and Anne was a little chilled.  She had offered  friendship frankly but it had not been accepted very graciously, if it  had not been absolutely repelled.  In silence they climbed the cliffs  and walked across a pasture-field of which the feathery, bleached, wild  grasses were like a carpet of creamy velvet in the moonlight.  When  they reached the shore lane Leslie turned.    \"I go this way, Mrs. Blythe.  You will come over and see me some time,  won't you?\"    Anne felt as if the invitation had been thrown at her.  She got the  impression that Leslie Moore gave it reluctantly.    \"I will come if you really want me to,\" she said a little coldly.    \"Oh, I do--I do,\" exclaimed Leslie, with an eagerness which seemed to  burst forth and beat down some restraint that had been imposed on it.    \"Then I'll come.  Good-night--Leslie.\"    \"Good-night, Mrs. Blythe.\"    Anne walked home in a brown study and poured out her tale to Gilbert.    \"So Mrs. Dick Moore isn't one of the race that knows Joseph?\" said  Gilbert teasingly.    \"No--o--o, not exactly.  And yet--I think she WAS one of them once, but  has gone or got into exile,\" said Anne musingly.  \"She is certainly  very different from the other women about here.  You can't talk about  eggs and butter to HER.  To think I've been imagining her a second Mrs.  Rachel Lynde!  Have you ever seen Dick Moore, Gilbert?\"    \"No.  I've seen several men working about the fields of the farm, but I  don't know which was Moore.\"    \"She never mentioned him.  I KNOW she isn't happy.\"    \"From what you tell me I suppose she was married before she was old  enough to know her own mind or heart, and found out too late that she  had made a mistake.  It's a common tragedy enough, Anne.    \"A fine woman would have made the best of it.  Mrs. Moore has evidently  let it make her bitter and resentful.\"    \"Don't let us judge her till we know,\" pleaded Anne.  \"I don't believe  her case is so ordinary.  You will understand her fascination when you  meet her, Gilbert.  It is a thing quite apart from her beauty.  I feel  that she possesses a rich nature, into which a friend might enter as  into a kingdom; but for some reason she bars every one out and shuts  all her possibilities up in herself, so that they cannot develop and  blossom.  There, I've been struggling to define her to myself ever  since I left her, and that is the nearest I can get to it.  I'm going  to ask Miss Cornelia about her.\"        CHAPTER 11    THE STORY OF LESLIE MOORE    \"Yes, the eighth baby arrived a fortnight ago,\" said Miss Cornelia,  from a rocker before the fire of the little house one chilly October  afternoon.  \"It's a girl.  Fred was ranting mad--said he wanted a  boy--when the truth is he didn't want it at all.  If it had been a boy  he'd have ranted because it wasn't a girl.  They had four girls and  three boys before, so I can't see that it made much difference what  this one was, but of course he'd have to be cantankerous, just like a  man.  The baby is real pretty, dressed up in its nice little clothes.  It has black eyes and the dearest, tiny hands.\"    \"I must go and see it.  I just love babies,\" said Anne, smiling to  herself over a thought too dear and sacred to be put into words.    \"I don't say but what they're nice,\" admitted Miss Cornelia.  \"But some  folks seem to have more than they really need, believe ME.  My poor  cousin Flora up at the Glen had eleven, and such a slave as she is!  Her husband suicided three years ago.  Just like a man!\"    \"What made him do that?\" asked Anne, rather shocked.    \"Couldn't get his way over something, so he jumped into the well.  A  good riddance!  He was a born tyrant.  But of course it spoiled the  well.  Flora could never abide the thought of using it again, poor  thing!  So she had another dug and a frightful expense it was, and the  water as hard as nails.  If he HAD to drown himself there was plenty of  water in the harbor, wasn't there?  I've no patience with a man like  that.  We've only had two suicides in Four Winds in my recollection.  The other was Frank West--Leslie Moore's father.  By the way, has  Leslie ever been over to call on you yet?\"    \"No, but I met her on the shore a few nights ago and we scraped an  acquaintance,\" said Anne, pricking up her ears.    Miss Cornelia nodded.    \"I'm glad, dearie.  I was hoping you'd foregather with her.  What do  you think of her?\"    \"I thought her very beautiful.\"    \"Oh, of course.  There was never anybody about Four Winds could touch  her for looks.  Did you ever see her hair?  It reaches to her feet when  she lets it down.  But I meant how did you like her?\"    \"I think I could like her very much if she'd let me,\" said Anne slowly.    \"But she wouldn't let you--she pushed you off and kept you at arm's  length.  Poor Leslie!  You wouldn't be much surprised if you knew what  her life has been.  It's been a tragedy--a tragedy!\" repeated Miss  Cornelia emphatically.    \"I wish you would tell me all about her--that is, if you can do so  without betraying any confidence.\"    \"Lord, dearie, everybody in Four Winds knows poor Leslie's story.  It's  no secret--the OUTSIDE, that is.  Nobody knows the INSIDE but Leslie  herself, and she doesn't take folks into her confidence.  I'm about the  best friend she has on earth, I reckon, and she's never uttered a word  of complaint to me.  Have you ever seen Dick Moore?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, I may as well begin at the beginning and tell you everything  straight through, so you'll understand it.  As I said, Leslie's father  was Frank West.  He was clever and shiftless--just like a man.  Oh, he  had heaps of brains--and much good they did him!  He started to go to  college, and he went for two years, and then his health broke down.  The Wests were all inclined to be consumptive.  So Frank came home and  started farming.  He married Rose Elliott from over harbor.  Rose was  reckoned the beauty of Four Winds--Leslie takes her looks from her  mother, but she has ten times the spirit and go that Rose had, and a  far better figure.  Now you know, Anne, I always take the ground that  us women ought to stand by each other.  We've got enough to endure at  the hands of the men, the Lord knows, so I hold we hadn't ought to  clapper-claw one another, and it isn't often you'll find me running  down another woman.  But I never had much use for Rose Elliott.  She  was spoiled to begin with, believe ME, and she was nothing but a lazy,  selfish, whining creature.  Frank was no hand to work, so they were  poor as Job's turkey.  Poor!  They lived on potatoes and point, believe  ME.  They had two children--Leslie and Kenneth.  Leslie had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#14)"],[1,"their slender hands over their mouths and noses, and suggest to the old  folks how they ought to behave to the princess who condescended to bless  them with her presence. The old woman must lay down the head that rested  in her bosom, the paraschites must drop the feet he so anxiously rubbed,  on the floor, to rise and kiss the dust before Bent-Anat. Whereupon--the  \"mind's eye\" of the young priest seemed to see it all--the courtiers  fled before him, pushing each other, and all crowded together into a  corner, and at last the princess threw a few silver or gold rings into  the laps of the father and mother, and perhaps to the girl too, and he  seemed to hear the courtiers all cry out: \"Hail to the gracious daughter  of the Sun!\"--to hear the joyful exclamations of the crowd of women--to  see the gorgeous apparition leave the hut of the despised people,  and then to see, instead of the lovely sick child who still breathed  audibly, a silent corpse on the crumpled mat, and in the place of the  two tender nurses at her head and feet, two heart-broken, loud-lamenting  wretches.    Pentaur's hot spirit was full of wrath. As soon as the noisy cortege  appeared actually in sight he would place himself in the doorway, forbid  the princess to enter, and receive her with strong words.    She could hardly come hither out of human kindness.    \"She wants variety,\" said he to himself, \"something new at Court; for  there is little going on there now the king tarries with the troops in  a distant country; it tickles the vanity of the great to find themselves  once in a while in contact with the small, and it is well to have  your goodness of heart spoken of by the people. If a little misfortune  opportunely happens, it is not worth the trouble to inquire whether  the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief to such wretched  people.\"    He ground his teeth angrily, and thought no more of the defilement which  might threaten Bent-Anat from the paraschites, but exclusively, on  the contrary, of the impending desecration by the princess of the holy  feelings astir in this silent room.    Excited as he was to fanaticism, his condemning lips could not fail to  find vigorous and impressive words.    He stood drawn to his full height and drawing his breath deeply, like  a spirit of light who holds his weapon raised to annihilate a demon of  darkness, and he looked out into the valley to perceive from afar the  cry of the runners and the rattle of the wheels of the gay train he  expected.    And he saw the doorway darkened by a lowly, bending figure, who, with  folded arms, glided into the room and sank down silently by the side of  the sick girl. The physicians and the old people moved as if to rise;  but she signed to them without opening her lips, and with moist,  expressive eyes, to keep their places; she looked long and lovingly in  the face of the wounded girl, stroked her white arm, and turning to the  old woman softly whispered to her    \"How pretty she is!\"    The paraschites' wife nodded assent, and the girl smiled and moved her  lips as though she had caught the words and wished to speak.    Bent-Anat took a rose from her hair and laid it on her bosom.    The paraschites, who had not taken his hands from the feet of the  sick child, but who had followed every movement of the princess, now  whispered, \"May Hathor requite thee, who gave thee thy beauty.\"    The princess turned to him and said, \"Forgive the sorrow, I have caused  you.\"    The old man stood up, letting the feet of the sick girl fall, and asked  in a clear loud voice:    \"Art thou Bent-Anat?\"    \"Yes, I am,\" replied the princess, bowing her head low, and in so gentle  a voice, that it seemed as though she were ashamed of her proud name.    The eyes of the old man flashed. Then he said softly but decisively:    \"Leave my hut then, it will defile thee.\"    \"Not till you have forgiven me for that which I did unintentionally.\"    \"Unintentionally! I believe thee,\" replied the paraschites. \"The hoofs  of thy horse became unclean when they trod on this white breast. Look  here--\" and he lifted the cloth from the girl's bosom, and showed her  the deep red wound, \"Look here--here is the first rose you laid on my  grandchild's bosom, and the second--there it goes.\"    The paraschites raised his arm to fling the flower through the door of  his hut. But Pentaur had approached him, and with a grasp of iron held  the old man's hand.    \"Stay,\" he cried in an eager tone, moderated however for the sake of the  sick girl. \"The third rose, which this noble hand has offered you, your  sick heart and silly head have not even perceived. And yet you must know  it if only from your need, your longing for it. The fair blossom of pure  benevolence is laid on your child's heart, and at your very feet, by  this proud princess. Not with gold, but with humility. And whoever the  daughter of Rameses approaches as her equal, bows before her, even if he  were the first prince in the Land of Egypt. Indeed, the Gods shall not  forget this deed of Bent-Anat. And you--forgive, if you desire to be  forgiven that guilt, which you bear as an inheritance from your fathers,  and for your own sins.\"    The paraschites bowed his head at these words, and when he raised it  the anger had vanished from his well-cut features. He rubbed his wrist,  which had been squeezed by Pentaur's iron fingers, and said in a tone  which betrayed all the bitterness of his feelings:    \"Thy hand is hard, Priest, and thy words hit like the strokes of a  hammer. This fair lady is good and loving, and I know; that she did not  drive her horse intentionally over this poor girl, who is my grandchild  and not my daughter. If she were thy wife or the wife of the leech  there, or the child of the poor woman yonder, who supports life by  collecting the feet and feathers of the fowls that are slaughtered for  sacrifice, I would not only forgive her, but console her for having made  herself like to me; fate would have made her a murderess without any  fault of her own, just as it stamped me as unclean while I was still  at my mother's breast. Aye--I would comfort her; and yet I am not very  sensitive. Ye holy three of Thebes!--[The triad of Thebes: Anion, Muth  and Chunsu.]--how should I be? Great and small get out of my way that  I may not touch them, and every day when I have done what it is my  business to do they throw stones at me.       [The paraschites, with an Ethiopian knife, cuts the flesh of the     corpse as deeply as the law requires: but instantly takes to flight,     while the relatives of the deceased pursue him with stones, and     curses, as if they wished to throw the blame on him.]    \"The fulfilment of duty--which brings a living to other men, which makes  their happiness, and at the same time earns them honor, brings me every  day fresh disgrace and painful sores. But I complain to no man, and  must forgive--forgive--forgive, till at last all that men do to me seems  quite natural and unavoidable, and I take it all like the scorching of  the sun in summer, and the dust that the west wind blows into my face.  It does not make me happy, but what can I do? I forgive all--\"    The voice of the paraschites had softened, and Bent-Anat, who looked  down on him with emotion, interrupted him, exclaiming with deep feeling:    \"And so you will forgive me?--poor man!\"    The old man looked steadily, not at her, but at Pentaur, while he  replied: \"Poor man! aye, truly, poor man. You have driven me out of the  world in which you live, and so I made a world for myself in this hut.  I do not belong to you, and if I forget it, you drive me out as an  intruder--nay as a wolf, who breaks into your fold; but you belong just  as little to me, only when you play the wolf and fall upon me, I must  bear it!\"    \"The princess came to your hut as a suppliant, and with the wish of  doing you some good,\" said Pentaur.    \"May the avenging Gods reckon it to her, when they visit on her the  crimes of her father against me! Perhaps it may bring me to prison, but  it must come out. Seven sons were mine, and Rameses took them all from  me and sent them to death; the child of the youngest, this girl, the  light of my eyes, his daughter has brought to her death. Three of my  boys the king left to die of thirst by the Tenat,       [Literally the \"cutting\" which, under Seti I., the father of     Rameses, was the first Suez Canal; a representation of it is found     on the northern outer wall of the temple of Karnak. It followed     nearly the same direction as the Fresh-water canal of Lesseps, and     fertilized the land of Goshen.]    which is to join the Nile to the Red Sea, three were killed by the  Ethiopians, and the last, the star of my hopes, by this time is eaten by  the hyaenas of the north.\"    At these words the old woman, in whose lap the head of the girl rested,  broke out into a loud cry, in which she was joined by all the other  women.    The sufferer started up frightened, and opened her eyes.    \"For whom are you wailing?\" she asked feebly. \"For your poor father,\"  said the old woman.    The girl smiled like a child who detects some well-meant deceit, and  said:    \"Was not my father here, with you? He is here, in Thebes, and looked at  me, and kissed me, and said that he is bringing home plunder, and that  a good time is coming for you. The gold ring that he gave me I was  fastening into my dress, when the chariot passed over me. I was just  pulling the knots, when all grew black before my eyes, and I saw and  heard nothing more. Undo it, grandmother, the ring is for you; I meant  to bring it to you. You must buy a beast for sacrifice with it, and wine  for grandfather, and eye salve       [The Egyptian mestem, that is stibium or antimony, which was     introduced into Egypt by the Asiatics at a very early period and     universally used.]    for yourself, and sticks of mastic,       [At the present day the"]]]
