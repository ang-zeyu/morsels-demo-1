It was like a miracle because the creature  did actually suffer from all those violent, debilitating emotions  expressed in its disordered cries and action, and it is the miracle of  Nature's marvellous health. If we, for example, were thrown into these  violent extremes of passion, we should not escape the after-effects. Our  whole system would suffer, a doctor would perhaps have to be called in  and would discourse wisely on metabolism and the development of toxins  in the muscles, and give us a bottle of medicine.    I will conclude this digression and dissertation on a bird's instinct by  relating the action of a hen-pheasant I once witnessed, partly because  it is the most striking one I have met with of that instantaneous  recovery of a bird from an extremity of distress and terror, and partly  for another reason which will appear at the end.    The hen-pheasant was a solitary bird, having strayed away from the  pheasant copses near the Itchen and found a nesting-place a mile away,  on the other side of the valley, among the tall grasses and sedges on its  border. I was the bird's only human neighbour, as I was staying in a  fishing-cottage near the spot where the bird had its nest. Eventually,  it brought off eight chicks and remained with them at the same spot on the  edge of the valley, living like a rail among the sedges and tall valley  herbage. I never went near the bird, but from the cottage caught sight of  it from time to time, and sometimes watched it with my binocular. There  was, I thought, a good chance of its being able to rear its young, unless  the damp proved injurious, as there was no dog or cat at the cottage, and  there were no carrion crows or sparrow-hawks at that spot. One morning  about five o'clock on going out I spied a fox-terrier, a poaching dog  from the neighbouring village, rushing about in an excited state a  hundred yards or so below the cottage. He had scented the birds, and  presently up rose the hen from the tall grass with a mighty noise, then  flopping down she began beating her wings and struggling over the grass,  uttering the most agonizing screams, the dog after her, frantically  grabbing at her tail. I feared that he would catch her, and seizing a  stick flew down to the rescue, yelling at the dog, but he was too excited  to obey or even hear me. At length, thanks to the devious course taken by  the bird, I got near enough to get in a good blow on the dog's back. He  winced and went on as furiously as ever, and then I got in another blow  so well delivered that the rascal yelled, and turning fled back to the  village. Hot and panting from my exertions, I stood still, but sooner  still the pheasant had pulled herself up and stood there, about three  yards from my feet, as if nothing had happened--as if not a ripple had  troubled the quiet surface of her life! The serenity of the bird, just  out of that storm of violence and danger, and her perfect indifference to  my presence, was astonishing to me. For a minute or two I stood still  watching her; then turned to walk back to the cottage, and no sooner did  I start than after me she came at a gentle trot, following me like a dog.  On my way back I came to the very spot where the fox-terrier had found  and attacked the bird, and at once on reaching it she came to a stop and  uttered a call, and instantly from eight different places among the tall  grasses the eight fluffy little chicks popped up and started running to  her. And there she stood, gathering them about her with gentle  chucklings, taking no notice of me, though I was standing still within  two yards of her!    Up to the moment when the dog got his smart blow and fled from her she  had been under the domination of a powerful instinct, and could have  acted in no other way; but what guided her so infallibly in her  subsequent actions? Certainly not instinct, and not reason, which  hesitates between different courses and is slow to arrive at a decision.  One can only say that it was, or was like, intuition, which is as much  as to say that we don't know.        IX      Among the rarer fringilline birds on the common were the cirl bunting,  bullfinch and goldfinch, the last two rarely seen. Linnets, however,  were abundant, now gathered in small flocks composed mainly of young  birds in plain plumage, with here and there an individual showing the  carmine-tinted breast of the adult male. Unhappily, a dreary fate was in  store for many of these blithe twitterers.    On June 24, when walking towards the pool, I spied two recumbent human  figures on a stretch of level turf near its banks, and near them a  something dark on the grass--a pair of clap-nets! \"Still another serpent  in my birds' paradise!\" said I to myself, and, walking on, I skirted the  nets and sat down on the grass beside the men. One was a rough  brown-faced country lad; the other, who held the strings and wore the  usual cap and comforter, was a man of about five-and-twenty, with pale  blue eyes and yellowish hair, close-cropped, and the unmistakable London  mark in his chalky complexion. He regarded me with cold, suspicious  looks, and, when I talked and questioned, answered briefly and somewhat  surlily. I treated him to tobacco, and he smoked; but it wasn't shag,  and didn't soften him. On mentioning casually that I had seen a stoat an  hour before, he exhibited a sudden interest. It was as if one had said  \"rats!\" to a terrier. I succeeded after a while in getting him to tell  me the name of the man to whom he sent his captives, and when I told him  that I knew the man well--a bird-seller in a low part of London--he  thawed visibly. Finally I asked him to look at a red-backed shrike,  perched on a bush about fifteen yards from his nets, through my  field-glasses, and from that moment he became as friendly as possible,  and conversed freely about his mystery. \"How near it brings him!\" he  exclaimed, with a grin of delight, after looking at the bird.  The  shrike had greatly annoyed him; it had been hanging about for some time,  he told me, dashing at the linnets and driving them off when they flew  down to the nets. Two or three times he might have caught it, but would  not draw the nets and have the trouble of resetting them for so  worthless a bird. \"But I'll take him the next time,\" he said  vindictively. \"I didn't know he was such a handsome bird.\"  Unfortunately, the shrike soon flew away, and passing linnets dropped  down, drawn to the spot by the twitterings of their caged fellows, and  were caught; and so it went on for a couple of hours, we conversing  amicably during the waiting intervals. For now he regarded me as a  friend of the bird-catcher. Linnets only were caught, most of them young  birds, which pleased him; for the young linnet after a month or two of  cage life will sing; but the adult males would be silent until the next  spring, consequently they were not worth so much, although the carmine  stain in their breast made them for the time so much more beautiful.    I remarked incidentally that there were some who looked with unfriendly  eyes on his occupation, and that, sooner or later, these people would  try to get an Act of Parliament to make bird-catching in lanes, on  commons and waste lands illegal. \"They can't do it!\" he exclaimed  excitedly. \"And if they can do it, and if they do do it, it will be the  ruination of England. For what would there be, then, to stop the birds  increasing? It stands to reason that the whole country would be eaten  up.\"    Doubtless the man really believed that but for the laborious days that  bird-catchers spend lying on the grass, the human race would be very  badly off.    Just after he had finished his protest, three or four linnets flew down  and were caught. Taking them from the nets, he showed them to me,  remarking, with a short laugh, that they were all young males. Then he  thrust them down the stocking-leg which served as an entrance to the  covered box he kept his birds in--the black hole in which their captive  life begins, where they were now all vainly fluttering to get out. Going  back to the previous subject, he said that he knew very well that many  persons disliked a bird-catcher, but there was one thing that nobody  could say against him--he wasn't cruel; he caught, but didn't kill. He  only killed when he caught a great number of female linnets, which were  not worth sending up; he pulled their heads off, and took them home to  make a linnet pie. Then, by way of contrast to his own merciful temper,  he told me of the young nest-destroyer I have writ-ten about. It made  him mad to see such things! Something ought to be done, he said, to stop  a boy like that; for by destroying so many nestlings he was taking the  bread out of the bird-catcher's mouth. Passing to other subjects, he  said that so far he had caught nothing but linnets on the common--you  couldn't expect to catch other kinds in June. Later on, in August and  September, there would be a variety. But he had small hopes of catching  goldfinches, they were too scarce now. Greenfinches, yellow-hammers,  common buntings, reed sparrows--all such birds were worth only tuppence  apiece. Oh, yes, he caught them just the same, and sent them up to  London, but that was all they were worth to him. For young male linnets  he got eightpence, sometimes tenpence; for hen birds fourpence, or less.  I dare say that eightpence was what he hoped to get, seeing that young  male linnets are not unfrequently sold by London dealers for sixpence  and even fourpence.  Goldfinches ran to eighteenpence, sometimes as much  as two shillings.  Starlings he had made a lot out of, but that was all  past and over. Why?    Because they were not wanted--because people were such fools that they  now preferred to shoot at pigeons. He hated pigeons!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#14)"],[1," \"This writing, or these marks you have made on  the paper, are not the same as the letters on the gold.\"    I took the paper and proceeded to copy the sentence I had written, but  in printing letters, beneath it, then returned it to him.    He examined it again, and, after comparing my letters with those on the  sovereigns, said: \"Pray tell me, now, what you have written here, and  explain why you write in two different ways?\"    I told him, as well as I could, why letters of one form were used to  stamp on gold and other substances, and of a different form for writing.  Then, with a modest blush, I read the words of the sentence: \"In  different parts of the world men have different customs, and write  different letters; but alike to all men in all places, a lie is  hateful.\"    \"Smith,\" he said, addressing me in an impressive manner, but happily not  to charge me with a third and bigger lie, \"I have lived long in the  world, and the knowledge others possess concerning it is mine also. It  is common knowledge that in the hotter and colder regions men are  compelled to live differently, owing to the conditions they are placed  in; but we know that everywhere they have the same law of right and  wrong inscribed on the heart, and, as you have said, hate a lie; also  that they all speak the same language; and until this moment I also  believed that they wrote in similar characters. You, however, have now  succeeded in convincing me that this is not the case; that in some  obscure valley, cut off from all intercourse by inaccessible mountains,  or in some small, unknown island of the sea, a people may exist--ah, did  you not tell me that you came from an island?\"    \"Yes, my home was on an island,\" I answered.    \"So I imagined. An island of which no report has ever reached us, where  the people, isolated from their fellows, have in the course of many  centuries changed their customs--even their manner of writing. Although  I had seen these gold pieces I did not understand, or did not realize,  that such a human family existed: now I am persuaded of it, and as I  alone am to blame for having brought this charge against you, I must now  ask your forgiveness. We rejoice at your innocence, and hope with  increased love to atone for our injustice. My son,\" he concluded,  placing a hand on my shoulder, \"I am now deeply in your debt.\"    \"I am glad it has ended so happily,\" I replied, wondering whether his  being in my debt would increase my chances with Yoletta or not.    Seeing him again directing curious glances at the stylograph, which I  was turning about in my fingers, I offered it to him.    He examined it with interest.    \"I have only been waiting for an opportunity,\" he said, \"to look closely  at this wonderful contrivance, for I had perceived that your writing was  not made with a pencil, but with a fluid. It is black polished stone,  beautifully fashioned and encircled with gold bands, and contains the  writing-fluid within itself. This surprises me as much as anything you  have told me.\"    \"Allow me to make you a present of it,\" said I, seeing him so taken with  it.    \"No, not so,\" he returned. \"But I should greatly like to possess it, and  will keep it if I may bestow in return something you desire.\"    Yoletta's hand was really the only thing in life I desired, but it was  too early to speak yet, as I knew nothing about their matrimonial  usages--not even whether or not the lady's consent was necessary to a  compact of the kind. I therefore made a more modest request. \"There is  one thing I greatly desire,\" I said. \"I am very anxious to be able to  read in your books, and shall consider myself more than compensated if  you will permit Yoletta to teach me.\"    \"She shall teach you in any case, my son,\" he returned. \"That, and much  more, is already owning to you.\"    \"There is nothing else I desire,\" said I. \"Pray keep the pen and make me  happy.\"    And thus ended a disagreeable matter.    The cloud having blown over, we all repaired to the supper-room, and  nothing could exceed our happiness as we sat at meat--or vegetables. Not  feeling so ravenously hungry as on the previous evening, and, moreover,  seeing them all in so lively a mood, I did not hesitate to join in the  conversation: nor did I succeed so very badly, considering the  strangeness of it all; for like the bee that has been much hindered at  his flowery work by geometric webs, I began to acquire some skill in  pushing my way gracefully through the tangling meshes of thought and  phrases that were new to me.    The afternoon's experiences had certainly been remarkable--a strange  mixture of pain and pleasure, not blending into homogeneous gray, but  resembling rather a bright embroidery on a dark, somber ground; and of  these surprising contrasts I was destined to have more that same  evening.    We were again assembled in the great room, the venerable father  reclining at his ease on his throne-like couch near the brass globes,  while the others pursued their various occupations as on the former  evening. Not being able to get near Yoletta, and having nothing to do, I  settled myself comfortably in one of the spacious seats, and gave up my  mind to pleasant dreams. At length, to my surprise, the father, who had  been regarding me for some time, said: \"Will you lead, my son?\"    I started up, turning very red in the face, for I did not wish to  trouble him with questions, yet was at a loss to know what he meant by  leading. I thought of several things--whist, evening prayers, dancing,  etc.; but being still in doubt, I was compelled to ask him to explain.    \"Will you lead the singing?\" he returned, looking a little surprised.    \"Oh yes, with pleasure,\" said I. There being no music about, and no  piano, I concluded naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo  songs without accompaniment of an evening, and having a good tenor voice  I was not unwilling to lead off with a song. Clearing my rusty throat  with a _ghrr-ghrr-hram_ which made them all jump, I launched forth  with the \"Vicar of Bray\"--a grand old song and a great favorite of mine.  They all started when I commenced, exchanging glances, and casting  astonished looks towards me; but it was getting so dusky in the room  that I could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me. Presently  some that were near me began retiring to distant seats, and this  distressed me so that it made me hoarse, and my singing became very bad  indeed; but still I thought it best to go bravely on to the end.  Suddenly the old gentleman, who had been staring wildly at me for some  time, drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and  head. I glanced at Yoletta, sitting at some distance, and saw that she  was holding her hands pressed to her ears.    I thought it about time to leave off then, and stopping abruptly in the  middle of the fourth stanza I sat down, feeling extremely hot and  uncomfortable. I was almost choking, and unable to utter a word. But  there was no word for me to utter: it was, of course, for them to thank  me for singing, or to say something; but not a word was spoken. Yoletta  dropped her hands and resumed her work, while the old man slowly emerged  with a somewhat frightened look from the wrappings; and then the long  dead silence becoming unendurable, I remarked that I feared my singing  was not to their taste. No reply was made; only the father, putting out  one of his hands, touched a handle or key near him, whereupon one of the  brass globes began slowly revolving. A low murmur of sound arose, and  seemed to pass like a wave through the room, dying away in the distance,  soon to be succeeded by another, and then another, each marked by an  increase of power; and often as this solemn sound died away, faint  flute-like notes were heard as if approaching, but still at a great  distance, and in the ensuing wave of sound from the great globes they  would cease to be distinguishable. Still the mysterious coming sounds  continued at intervals to grow louder and clearer, joined by other tones  as they progressed, now altogether bursting out in joyous chorus, then  one purest liquid note soaring bird-like alone, but whether from voices  or wind-instruments I was unable to tell, until the whole air about me  was filled and palpitating with the strange, exquisite harmony, which  passed onwards, the tones growing fewer and fainter by degrees until  they almost died out of hearing in the opposite direction. That all were  now taking part in the performance I became convinced by watching in  turn different individuals, some of them having small, curiously-shaped  instruments in their hands, but there was a blending of voices and a  something like ventriloquism in the tones which made it impossible to  distinguish the notes of any one person. Deeper, more sonorous tones now  issued from the revolving globes, sometimes resembling in character the  vox humana of an organ, and every time they rose to a certain pitch  there were responsive sounds--not certainly from any of the  performers--low, tremulous, and Aeolian in character, wandering over the  entire room, as if walls and ceiling were honey-combed with sensitive  musical cells, answering to the deeper vibrations. These floating aerial  sounds also answered to the higher notes of some of the female singers,  resembling soprano voices, brightened and spiritualized in a wonderful  degree; and then the wide room would be filled with a mist, as it were,  of this floating, formless melody, which seemed to come from invisible  harpers hovering in the shadows above.    Lying back on my couch, listening with closed eyes to this mysterious,  soul-stirring concert, I was affected to tears, and almost feared that I  had been snatched away into some supra-mundane region inhabited by  beings of an angelic or half-angelic order--feared, I say, for, with  this new love in my heart, no elysium or starry abode could compare"]]]
