Each man as he entered was stopped  just inside the door. A noose was dropped over his neck, and he  was hauled up to a hook over the door. All who entered are dead.\"    A cry of indignation and rage broke from Wallace and those standing  round him, and the Scottish leader again repeated his oath to take  a bloody vengeance for the deed.    \"And who are among the murdered?\" he asked, after a pause.    \"Alas! Sir William,\" Grahame said, \"your good uncle, Sir Ronald  Crawford, the Sheriff of Ayr, is one; and also Sir Richard Wallace  of Riccartoun; Sir Bryce Blair, and Sir Neil Montgomery, Boyd,  Barclay, Steuart, Kennedy, and many others.\"    Wallace was overwhelmed with grief at the news that both his uncles,  to whom he was greatly attached, had perished. Most of those around  had also lost relatives and friends, and none could contain their  grief and indignation.    \"Was my uncle, Sir Robert Gordon, among the victims?\" Archie  inquired.    \"No,\" Sir John replied; \"happily he was one of the last who came  along the road.\"    \"Thank God for that!\" Archie said earnestly; \"my uncle's slowness  has saved his life. He was ever late for business or pleasure, and  my aunt was always rating him for his unpunctuality. She will not  do so again, for assuredly it has saved his life.\"    The men came in but slowly, for the bands had all dispersed to  their homes, and it was only those who lived within a few miles  who could arrive in time. Little over fifty men had come in by the  hour named. With these Wallace started at once towards Ayr. Archie's  band fell in with their arms, for they too burned to revenge the  massacre, and Wallace did not refuse Archie's request that they  might join.    \"Let them come,\" he said; \"we shall want every sword and pike  tonight.\"    This was the first time that Wallace had seen the band under arms,  for at the battle of Biggar, Archie had kept them from his sight,  fearing that he might order them from the field.    \"They look well, Sir Archie, and in good military order.  Hitherto  I have regarded them but as messengers, and as such they have done  good service indeed; but I see now that you have them in good order,  and that they can do other service on a pinch.\"    One member of Wallace's band was left behind, with orders to wait  until seven o'clock, and then to bring on as fast as they could  march all who might arrive before that hour. The band marched to  within a mile of the barns. They then halted at a stack of straw,  and sat down while one of Archie's band went forward to see what was  being done. He reported that a great feast, at which the governor  and all the officers of the garrison, with other English dwelling  in town, were present, was just beginning in the great barn where  the massacre had taken place.    Soon after nine o'clock the man who had been left behind, with ten  others, who had come in after Wallace had marched, came up. Each  man, by Wallace's directions, drew a great truss of straw from the  stack, and then the party, now eighty in all, marched toward the  barn. Wallace's instructions were that so soon as the work had  fairly begun, Grahame, with Archie and half the band, was to hurry  off to seize the gate of Ayr, feigning to be a portion of the guard  at the barn.    When they approached the spot they saw that the wooden building was  brightly lit up with lights within, and the English guard, some  fifty in number, were standing carelessly without, or, seated  round fires, were carousing on wine which had been sent out by the  revellers within.    The Scotch stole up quietly. Wallace's party, composed of half the  strength, handed their bundles of straw to the men of Grahame's  company; then with a sudden shout they fell upon the English  soldiers, while Grahame's men, running straight to the door of the  barn, threw down their trusses of straw against it, and Sir John,  snatching down a torch which burned beside the entrance, applied  fire to the mass, and then, without a moment's delay, started at a  run towards the town. Taken wholly by surprise the English soldiers  were slain by Wallace and his men almost before they had time  to seize their arms. Then the Scots gathered round the barn.  The  flames were already leaping up high, and a terrible din of shouts  and cries issued from within. The doors had been opened now, but  those within were unable to force their way across the blazing mass  of straw. Many appeared at the windows and screamed for mercy, and  some leapt out, preferring to fall by the Scottish swords rather  than to await death by fire within.    The flames rose higher and higher, and soon the whole building  was enveloped, and ere many minutes all those who had carried out,  if not planned, the massacre of Ayr had perished. In the meantime  Grahame and his party had reached the gate of Ayr. Bidding others  follow him at a distance of about a hundred yards, he himself, with  Archie and ten of his followers, ran up at full speed.    \"Quick!\" he shouted to the sentry on the gate. \"Lower the bridge  and let us in. We have been attacked by Wallace and the Scots, and  they will speedily be here.\"    The attention of the guard had already been attracted by the sudden  burst of light by the barns. They had heard distant shouts, and  deemed that a conflagration had broken out in the banqueting hall.  Not doubting for an instant the truth of Grahame's story, they  lowered the drawbridge instantly, and Sir John and his companions  rushed across.    The guard were only undeceived when Grahame and his followers fell  upon them with their heavy broadswords.  They had left their arms  behind when they had assembled on the walls to look at the distant  flames, and were cut down to a man by the Scots. By this time the  rest of Grahame's band had arrived.    So short and speedy had been the struggle that no alarm had been  given in the town. The inmates of a few houses near opened their  windows and looked out.    \"Come down as quickly as you may,\" Sir John said to them; \"we have  taken Ayr.\"    Several of the burghers were soon in the street.    \"Now,\" Sir John said, \"do two of you who know the town well go  with me and point out the houses in which the English troops are  quartered; let the others go from house to house, and bid every  man come quickly with his sword to strike a blow for freedom.\"    Sir John now went round the town with the guides and posted two or  more men at the door of each house occupied by the English. Soon  the armed citizens flocked into the streets, and when sufficient  were assembled the blowing of a horn gave the signal. The doors of  the houses were beaten in with axes, and, pouring in, the Scotch  slew the soldiers before they had scarce awakened from sleep. Very  few of the English in the town escaped to tell of the terrible  retaliation which had been taken for the massacre of Ayr.    One of the few who were saved was Captain Thomas Hawkins. Archie,  mindful of the part which he had taken, and to which, indeed, the  discovery of the governor's intention was due, had hurried direct to  the prison, and when this was, with the rest of the town, taken,  discovered the English officer in chains in a dungeon, and protected  him from all molestation.    The next morning he was brought before Wallace, who expressed to  him his admiration of the honourable course which he had adopted,  gave him a rich present out of the booty which had been captured,  and placed him on a ship bound for England.    A week after the capture of Ayr one of Archie's band came into his  hut. Tears were running down his cheeks, and his face was swollen  with weeping.    \"What is it, Jock?\" Archie asked kindly.    \"Ah! Sir Archie! we have bad news from Glen Cairn.  One has come  hither who says that a few days since the Kerrs, with a following  of their own retainers, came down to the village. Having heard  that some of us had followed you to the wars, they took a list of  all that were missing, and Sir John called our fathers up before  him. They all swore, truly enough, that they knew nought of our  intentions, and that we had left without saying a word to them.  Sir John refused to believe them, and at first threatened to hang  them all.  Then after a time he said they might draw lots, and  that two should die. My father and Allan Cunninghame drew the evil  numbers, and Kerr hung them up to the old tree on the green and put  fire to the rooftrees of all the others. Ah! but there is weeping  and wailing in Glen Cairn!\"    Archie was for a while speechless with indignation. He knew well  that this wholesale vengeance had not been taken by the Kerrs because  the sons of the cottagers of Glen Cairn had gone to join the army  of Wallace, but because he deemed them to be still attached to their  old lord; and it was to their fidelity to the Forbeses rather than  to Scotland that they owed the ruin which had befallen them.    \"My poor Jock!\" he said, \"I am grieved, indeed, at this misfortune.  I cannot restore your father's life, but I can from the spoils of  Ayr send a sufficient sum to Glen Cairn to rebuild the cottages  which the Kerrs have destroyed. But this will not be enough--we  will have vengeance for the foul deed. Order the band to assemble  at dusk this evening, and tell Orr and Macpherson to come here to  me at once.\"    Archie had a long consultation with his two young lieutenants,  whose fathers' cottages had with the others been destroyed.    \"What we have to do,\" Archie said, \"we must do alone.  Sir William  has ample employment for his men, and I cannot ask him to weaken  his force to aid me in a private broil; nor, indeed, would any aid  short of his whole band be of use, seeing that the Kerrs can put  three hundred retainers in the field.

Thanks      to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor force,      and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies specialized      niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces      almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in      agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and      the opening of Eastern Europe, boosted the economy during 1990 and to a      lesser extent in 1991. GDP growth slowed from 4.9% in 1990 to 3% in 1991 -      mainly due to the weaker world economy - and is expected to drop to around      2% in 1992. Inflation is forecasted at about 4%, while unemployment probably      will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993. Living      standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western      Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level      of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget      capabilities. Austria, which has applied for EC membership, was involved in      EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic      Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of      goods, services, capital, and labor within the EC.
