Our provisions were exhausted and we had cleaned up everything before  Jesse Jones came to our relief. We were now in a tight place. There was  a set of harness and an old pack saddle covered with rawhide still on  hand, that some of the boys considered safe to depend upon for a few  days, still we had great hopes of getting something better. Our faith  had been much strengthened by receiving the supplies mentioned.    As usual we went out to see what we could find in the way of game.  After traveling through the snow for several miles at the foot of  the mountains, we saw a drove of mountain sheep. They were standing,  seemingly entirely off their guard. I was in front and saw the sheep,  as I supposed before they did me. We dodged down out of sight. I crept  to a large rock, fully expecting to get meat. When I looked to get  a shot the game was gone, I could see it making for the top of the  mountain. We watched them for a minute or two and they were soon too  far for us to follow. My heart almost failed me, and I could have cried  like a child, for I knew that nothing was in camp when we left and our  comrades expected us to bring something for supper.    We were convinced that nothing could be obtained this day by hunting,  so we started for home. After traveling a few miles we struck the road  below Devil's Gate and here we stopped to hold a council.    As will be remembered, our instructions from Brother Brigham were never  to leave the fort with less than ten men. There never had been a time  when we had that many men able to stand very hard service. Sometimes  I felt like disregarding counsel and going out to try to get food,  or perish in the attempt. But up to this time we had all followed  instructions as nearly as possible. Now here was a trial for me. I  firmly believed I could go on foot to Platte bridge and get something  to save the lives of my comrades. Very few of the others were able, but  all were willing to go with me. I told them if counsel had to be broken  I would risk no one but myself, and would go alone. The boys thought  they could live five days before starving. So it was arranged that I  should start alone next morning for the Platte bridge. I had now been  one day without food, it would take two more to reach the bridge, where  there were traders, as the snow was from eighteen inches to three feet  deep. This looked a little hard, but I had fully made up my mind to try  it.    On arriving in sight of camp we saw a number of horses; we knew some  one had arrived but had no idea who it was. A shout of joy rang out  from our crowd that made the hills ring. All mankind were friends to  us then. I often wonder why people are enemies. My experience in life,  with a few exceptions, has been more of the friendly than warlike  nature. I have been fed and helped by all classes of people, and  mankind in general are not so bad when properly approached.    The new arrivals proved to be the first company of the Y. X. Express,  with William Hickman in charge. This was the first effort of this firm  to send the mail through. Several old acquaintances were along, and of  course we were rejoiced to see them, especially so when we learned they  had a good supper for us. Among the party were George Boyd of Salt Lake  City and Joshua Terry of Draperville.    A day or two before their arrival Brother Terry had killed a large  buffalo and they packed the whole of it into our camp.    I remember about the first thing I did after shaking hands, was to  drink a pint of strong salty broth, where some salt pork had been  boiled.    When Hickman's company arrived, some of our boys were getting the pack  saddle soaked up ready for cooking the hide covering. Boyd always calls  me the man that ate the pack saddle. But this is slander. The kindness  of him and others prevented me from eating my part of it. I think if  they had not arrived, probably I would have taken a _wing_ or _leg_, but  don't think I would have eaten the whole of it. As it was, the saddle  was allowed to dry up again, and may be in existence yet and doing well  so far as I know.    In Hickman's book he says he found us starving with plenty of  provisions in store houses, but did not dare to take them; that on his  arrival he burst open the store houses and told us to help ourselves.  Can anyone believe such stuff? If all his book is like this for truth,  one would do well to believe the reverse. Hickman left about the 6th of  March, going on east.    Ben Hampton and myself started to go on to Platte bridge with this  party, intending to get some supplies if possible. Hickman left us two  animals and with one of ours (the other three had long since been eaten  by the wolves) found nearby we felt ourselves rich.    We had gone but a few miles when we met some men from the Platte  bringing us some beef. They had heard in some way that we were still  alive. I think the Indians must have passed the word. They could not  get buffalo meat, so had killed some cattle and were bringing them to  us. They had been four days on the road, tramping snow and working  through drifts, expecting to find us starving. I often think of these  old pioneers, who were always so ready to help a fellowman in need.    We bade good-by to Hickman and party and returned to the fort with the  meat. We paid for it in goods from Brother Van Cott's boxes, paying  mostly calico and domestic. They charged us ten cents per pound, which  was very cheap considering.    With our animals and meat we felt quite well fitted out; for we had now  become so used to taking what we could get thankfully, that we looked  upon these two mules left us as sure food when all else failed.    While Jesse Jones was in camp, one of his men gave me a small book of  words in the Snake language. I expected the Indians around and studied  hard every day. Soon they commenced coming in to see us. There were  over one hundred lodges of Snakes and Bannocks came in from the Wind  river country and camped about fifteen miles from us. Small bands  camped around us in different directions. They soon learned we were  short of provisions.    The first party that brought meat to us wanted to charge an  unreasonable price for it. I talked with them quite a while before they  would consent to sell it cheaper. They said that they themselves were  hungry, showing us their bare arms, how lean they were. But I told them  it was not just to take advantage of our circumstances. I weighed up a  dollar's worth of meat on a pair of spring balances, marked the scales  plainly and told them I would give no more. They consented, and we  bought hundreds of pounds afterwards without more trouble. In buying we  had to weigh one dollar's worth at a time, no matter how much they sold  us.    We exchanged various articles with them, many of the company trading  shirts, handkerchiefs and such things as they could spare. We had some  coffee, for which the Indians traded readily. This helped us out for  a short season; but game became so scarce that this camp of natives  (several hundred) had to move out or starve. They came up the first day  and pitched their lodges near us. We had but little provisions on hand,  some meat and a few pounds of flour that we used to thicken our broth  was all. We had about lost our appetite for bread. We were a little  uneasy to have all these hungry Indians come upon us at once; the  greatest care had to be taken to avoid trouble.    They were not of the best class, being a party made up of Snakes and  Bannocks, who had left their regular tribes and chiefs and joined  together under an ambitious young fellow named Tabawantooa. Washakie,  the old Snake chief, called them bad men.    There was one little party under an old petty chief, Toquatah, who  kept apart from the main band. From them we had procured most of our  meat. Toquatah had informed us that the main band and his were not on  the best of terms, and that Tabawantooa was \"no good.\" This naturally  made us feel a little uneasy. We had some two hundred wagon loads of  valuable goods under our charge, and only twenty men, the greater  portion of them with no frontier experience.    The store rooms were blocked up with logs, and had been all winter.    By this time I could talk considerable Snake and many of these Indians  understood Ute.    Tabawantooa and his band came in sight of our quarters about noon. They  were all mounted and well armed. The chief with many others rode up in  quite a pompous style, no doubt expecting to be looked upon with awe  and treated with great deference.    I had time to get my wits together before they got to our gate where  an armed guard was stationed. Brother Alexander was to be chief cook.  Knowing that from such as we had we would have to make a great showing  of hospitality, we concluded to make up in ceremony what was lacking in  food. So all the camp-kettles and coffee-pots were filled and put on.  The one for weak soup the other for strong coffee. We had plenty of the  latter on hand.    The company were instructed to go into their rooms, shut the doors,  keep quiet, and not to show themselves unless ordered to do so. Brother  Hampton was to be general roust-a-bout, ready for any emergency; I was  to meet these Indians outside and invite them in the gate, as we knew  the chief and grandees of the band would expect to be entertained.    Soon the chief with some fifty others rode up to the fort, while  hundreds more passed on a short distance and commenced to put up their  lodges. I met the chief, shook hands, and asked him to get down and  come in. He wanted to know if they could not ride inside. I told him  no, and explained to him that we had a lot of men in the fort who were  afraid of Indians; that they had gone into their houses and shut the  doors; but the door of my house was open for them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"some similar  precaution against the box or the bottle being opened. One of the  Pashas whom I attended,-a brave soldier who had been a favourite with  Mohammed Ali, and therefore was degraded by his successor,-kept an  impression of my ring in wax, to compare with that upon the phials. Men  have not forgotten how frequently, in former times, those who became  obnoxious to the State were seized with sudden and fatal cramps in the  stomach. In the case of the doctor it is common prudence to adopt these  precautions, as all evil consequences would be charged upon him, and he  would be exposed to the family's revenge.    Cairo, though abounding in medical practitioners, can still support  more; but to thrive they must be Indians, Chinese, or Maghrabis. The  Egyptians are thoroughly disgusted with European treatment, which is  here about as efficacious as in India-that is to say, not at all. But  they are ignorant of the medicine of Hind, and therefore great is its  name; deservedly perhaps, for skill in simples and dietetics. Besides  which the Indian    [p.58]may deal in charms and spells,-things to which the latitude gives  such force that even Europeans learn to put faith in them. The  traveller who, on the banks of the Seine, scoffs at Sights and Sounds,  Table-turning and Spirit-rapping, sees in the wilds of Tartary and  Thibet a something supernatural and diabolical in the bungling Sie-fa  of the Bokte.[FN#16] Some sensible men, who pass for philosophers among  their friends, have been caught by the incantations of the turbanded  and bearded Cairo magician. In our West African colonies the phrase  \"growing black\" was applied to colonists, who, after a term of  residence, became thoroughly imbued with the superstitions of the land.  And there are not wanting old Anglo-Indians, intelligent men, that  place firm trust in tales and tenets too puerile even for the Hindus to  believe. As a \"Hindi\" I could use animal magnetism, taking care,  however, to give the science a specious supernatural appearance. Haji  Wali, who, professing positive scepticism, showed the greatest interest  in the subject as a curiosity, advised me not to practise pure  mesmerism; otherwise, that I should infallibly become a \"Companion of  Devils.\" \"You must call this an Indian secret,\" said my friend, \"for it  is clear that you are no Mashaikh,[FN#17] and people will ask, where  are your drugs, and what business have you with charms?\" It is useless  to say that I followed his counsel; yet patients would consider  themselves my    [p.59]Murids (disciples), and delighted in kissing the hand of the  Sahib Nafas[FN#18] or minor saint.    The Haji repaid me for my docility by vaunting me everywhere as the  very phoenix of physicians. My first successes were in the Wakalah;  opposite to me there lived an Arab slave dealer, whose Abyssinians  constantly fell sick. A tender race, they suffer when first transported  to Egypt from many complaints, especially consumption, dysentery and  varicose veins. I succeeded in curing one girl. As she was worth at  least fifteen pounds, the gratitude of her owner was great, and I had  to dose half a dozen others in order to cure them of the pernicious and  price-lowering habit of snoring. Living in rooms opposite these slave  girls, and seeing them at all hours of the day and night, I had  frequent opportunities of studying them. They were average specimens of  the steato-pygous Abyssinian breed, broad-shouldered, thin-flanked,  fine-limbed, and with haunches of a prodigious size. None of them had  handsome features, but the short curly hair that stands on end being  concealed under a kerchief, there was something pretty in the brow,  eyes, and upper part of the nose, coarse and sensual in the pendent  lips, large jowl and projecting mouth, whilst the whole had a  combination of piquancy with sweetness. Their style of flirtation was  peculiar.    \"How beautiful thou art, O Maryam!-what eyes!-what-\"    [p.60]\"Then why,\"-would respond the lady-\"don't you buy me?\"    \"We are of one faith-of one creed-formed to form each other's  happiness.\"    \"Then why don't you buy me?\"    \"Conceive, O Maryam, the blessing of two hearts-\"    \"Then why don't you buy me?\"    and so on. Most effectual gag to Cupid's eloquence! Yet was not the  plain-spoken Maryam's reply without its moral. How often is it our  fate, in the West as in the East, to see in bright eyes and to hear  from rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed, \"Why don't you buy me?\"  or, worse still, \"Why can't you buy me?\"    All I required in return for my services from the slave-dealer, whose  brutal countenance and manners were truly repugnant, was to take me  about the town, and explain to me certain mysteries in his craft, which  knowledge might be useful in time to come. Little did he suspect who  his interrogator was, and freely in his unsuspiciousness he entered  upon the subject of slave hunting in the Somali country, and Zanzibar,  of all things the most interesting to me. I have, however, nothing new  to report concerning the present state of bondsmen in Egypt. England  has already learned that slaves are not necessarily the most wretched  and degraded of men. Some have been bold enough to tell the British  public that, in the generality of Oriental countries,[FN#19] the serf  fares far    [p.61]better than the servant, or indeed than the poorer orders of  freemen. \"The laws of Mahomet enjoin his followers to treat slaves with  the greatest mildness, and the Moslems are in general scrupulous  observers of the Apostle's recommendation. Slaves are considered  members of the family, and in houses where free servants are also kept,  they seldom do any other work than filling the pipes, presenting the  coffee, accompanying their master when going out, rubbing his feet when  he takes his nap in the afternoon, and driving away the flies from him.  When a slave is not satisfied, he can legally compel his master to sell  him. He has no care for food, lodging, clothes and washing, and has no  taxes to pay; he is exempt from military service and soccage, and in  spite of his bondage is freer than the freest Fellah in Egypt.[FN#20]\"  This is, I believe, a true statement, but of course it in no wise  affects the question of slavery in the abstract. A certain amount of  reputation was the consequence of curing the Abyssinian girls: my  friend Haji Wali carefully told the news to all the town, and before  fifteen days were over, I found myself obliged to decline extending a  practice which threatened me with fame.    Servants are most troublesome things to all Englishmen in Egypt, but  especially to one travelling as a respectable native, and therefore  expected to have slaves. After much deliberation, I resolved to take a  Berberi,[FN#21]    [p.62]and accordingly summoned a Shaykh-there is a Shaykh for  everything down to thieves in \"the East,\" (in Egypt since the days of  Diodorus Siculus), and made known my want. The list of sine qua nons  was necessarily rather an extensive one,-good health and a readiness to  travel anywhere, a little skill in cooking, sewing and washing,  willingness to fight, and a habit of regular prayers. After a day's  delay the Shaykh brought me a specimen of his choosing, a  broad-shouldered, bandy-legged fellow, with the usual bull-dog  expression of the Berberis, in his case rendered doubly expressive by  the drooping of an eyelid-an accident brought about with acrid juice in  order to avoid conscription. He responded sturdily to all my questions.  Some Egyptian donkey boys and men were making a noise in the room at  the time, and the calm ferocity with which he ejected them commanded my  approval. When a needle, thread, and an unhemmed napkin were handed to  him, he sat down, held the edge of the cloth between his big toe and  its neighbour, and finished the work in quite a superior style. Walking  out, he armed himself with a Kurbaj, which he used, now lightly, then  heavily, upon all laden animals, biped and quadruped, that came in the  way. His conduct proving equally satisfactory in the kitchen, after  getting security from him, and having his name registered by the  Shaykh,[FN#22] I closed with him for eighty piastres a    [p.63]month. But Ali the Berberi and I were destined to part. Before a  fortnight he stabbed his fellow servant-a Surat lad, who wishing to  return home forced his services upon me-and for this trick he received,  with his dismissal, 400 blows on the feet by order of the Zabit, or  police magistrate. After this failure I tried a number of servants,  Egyptians, Sa'idis,[FN#23] and clean and unclean eating[FN#24]  Berberis. Recommended by different Shaykhs, all had some fatal defect;  one cheated recklessly, another robbed me, a third drank, a fourth was  always in scrapes for infringing the Julian edict, and the last, a  long-legged Nubian, after remaining two days in the house, dismissed me  for expressing    [p.64]a determination to travel by sea from Suez to Yambu'. I kept one  man; he complained that he was worked to death: two-they did nothing  but fight; and three-they left me, as Mr. Elwes said of old, to serve  myself. At last, thoroughly tired of Egyptian domestics, and one  servant being really sufficient for comfort, as well as suitable to my  assumed rank, I determined to keep only the Indian boy. He had all the  defects of his nation; a brave at Cairo, he was an arrant coward at  Al-Madinah; the Badawin despised him heartily for his effeminacy in  making his camel kneel to dismount, and he could not keep his hands  from picking and stealing. But the choice had its advantages: his  swarthy skin and chubby features made the Arabs always call him an  Abyssinian slave, which, as it favoured my disguise, I did not care to  contradict; he served well, he was amenable to discipline, and being  completely dependent upon me, he was therefore less likely to watch and  especially to prate about my"]]]
