Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur's only son asked his  father to give him a large sum of money, in order that he might go and  seek his fortune in the principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful  lady possessed with seven evil spirits. The king did his best to  persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last gave way and the  prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the other for  himself to ride upon. Now, after several days' travel, he came to a  market-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered  together. The prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they had  arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the deceased  owed when he died. The prince replied that it was a pity creditors  should be so cruel, and said: \"Go bury the dead, and let his creditors  come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid.\" They came,  in such great numbers that before night he had only twopence left for  himself.    Now Jack the Giant-Killer, coming that way, was so taken with the  generosity of the prince, that he desired to be his servant. This  being agreed upon, the next morning they set forward on their journey  together, when, as they were riding out of the town, an old woman called  after the prince, saying, \"He has owed me twopence these seven years;  pray pay me as well as the rest.\" Putting his hand to his pocket, the  prince gave the woman all he had left, so that after their day's food,  which cost what small spell Jack had by him, they were without a penny  between them.    When the sun got low, the king's son said: \"Jack, since we have no  money, where can we lodge this night?\"    But Jack replied: \"Master, we'll do well enough, for I have an uncle  lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and monstrous giant  with three heads; he'll fight five hundred men in armour, and make them  to fly before him.\" \"Alas!\" quoth the prince, \"what shall we do there?  He'll certainly chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are scarce enough to  fill one of his hollow teeth!\"    \"It is no matter for that,\" quoth Jack; \"I myself will go before and  prepare the way for you; therefore stop here and wait till I return.\"  Jack then rode away at full speed, and coming to the gate of the castle,  he knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills resound. The  giant roared out at this like thunder: \"Who's there?\"    Jack answered: \"None but your poor cousin Jack.\"    Quoth he: \"What news with my poor cousin Jack?\"    He replied: \"Dear uncle, heavy news, God wot!\"    \"Prithee,\" quoth the giant, \"what heavy news can come to me? I am  a giant with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five  hundred men in armour, and make them fly like chaff before the wind.\"    \"Oh, but,\" quoth Jack, \"here's the king's son a-coming with a thousand  men in armour to kill you and destroy all that you have!\"    \"Oh, cousin Jack,\" said the giant, \"this is heavy news indeed! I will  immediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar  me in, and keep the keys until the prince is gone.\" Having secured the  giant, Jack fetched his master, when they made themselves heartily merry  whilst the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.    Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of  gold and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,  at which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant.  Jack then returned, and let the giant out of the vault, who asked what  he should give him for keeping the castle from destruction. \"Why,\" quoth  Jack, \"I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together with the old  rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed's head.\" Quoth the giant:  \"You know not what you ask; they are the most precious things I have.  The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will tell you all you want to  know, the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike, and the shoes are  of extraordinary swiftness. But you have been very serviceable to me,  therefore take them with all my heart.\" Jack thanked his uncle, and then  went off with them. He soon overtook his master and they quickly arrived  at the house of the lady the prince sought, who, finding the prince to  be a suitor, prepared a splendid banquet for him. After the repast was  concluded, she told him she had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with  a handkerchief, saying: \"You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow  morning, or else you will lose your head.\" With that she put it in  her bosom. The prince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack's cap of  knowledge informed him how it was to be obtained. In the middle of the  night she called upon her familiar spirit to carry her to Lucifer. But  Jack put on his coat of darkness and his shoes of swiftness, and was  there as soon as she was. When she entered the place of the Old One, she  gave the handkerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf, whence  Jack took it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady  next day, and so saved his life. On that day, she gave the prince a kiss  and told him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning that she kissed  last night, or lose his head.    \"Ah!\" he replied, \"if you kiss none but mine, I will.\"    \"That is neither here nor there,\" said she; \"if you do not, death's your  portion!\"    At midnight she went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for  letting the handkerchief go. \"But now,\" quoth she, \"I will be too hard  for the king's son, for I will kiss thee, and he is to show me thy  lips.\" Which she did, and Jack, when she was not standing by, cut off  Lucifer's head and brought it under his invisible coat to his master,  who the next morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady. This  broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her, and she appeared in  all her beauty. They were married the next morning, and soon after went  to the court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great exploits, was  made one of the Knights of the Round Table.    Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not ridden far,  when he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he beheld a giant sitting  upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side. His goggle  eyes were like flames of fire, his countenance grim and ugly, and his  cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon, while the bristles of  his beard resembled rods of iron wire, and the locks that hung down upon  his brawny shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders. Jack  alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat of darkness, went up  close to the giant, and said softly: \"Oh! are you there? It will not  be long before I take you fast by the beard.\" The giant all this while  could not see him, on account of his invisible coat, so that Jack,  coming up close to the monster, struck a blow with his sword at his  head, but, missing his aim, he cut off the nose instead. At this, the  giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to lay about him with his  iron club like one stark mad. But Jack, running behind, drove his sword  up to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he fell down dead. This  done, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it, with his brother's  also, to King Arthur, by a waggoner he hired for that purpose.    Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his treasure,  and, passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came  at length to a large room paved with freestone, at the upper end of  which was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large table, at  which the giant used to dine. Then he came to a window, barred with  iron, through which he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable  captives, who, seeing him, cried out: \"Alas! young man, art thou come to  be one amongst us in this miserable den?\"    \"Ay,\" quoth Jack, \"but pray tell me what is the meaning of your  captivity?\"    \"We are kept here,\" said one, \"till such time as the giants have a wish  to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered! And many are the  times they have dined upon murdered men!\"    \"Say you so,\" quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the gate and let them  free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon. Then  searching the giant's coffers, he shared the gold and silver equally  amongst them and took them to a neighbouring castle, where they all  feasted and made merry over their deliverance.    But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that one  Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his  kinsmen, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack, and  was within a mile of the castle, the country people flying before him  like chaff. But Jack was not a bit daunted, and said: \"Let him come! I  have a tool to pick his teeth; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out  into the garden, and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell's death  and destruction.\"    The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by a  moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over which lay a drawbridge.  So Jack employed men to cut through this bridge on both sides, nearly to  the middle; and then, dressing himself in his invisible coat, he marched  against the giant with his sword of sharpness. Although the giant could  not see Jack, he smelt his approach, and cried out in these words:      \"Fee, fi, fo, fum!    I smell the blood of an Englishman!    Be he alive or be he dead,    I'll grind his bones to make me bread!\"    \"Say'st thou so,\" said Jack; \"then thou art a monstrous miller indeed.\"    The giant cried out again: \"Art thou that villain who killed my kinsmen?  Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood, and grind thy bones  to powder.\"    \"You'll have to catch me first,\" quoth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#14)"],[1,"Soyûti, apud Poc.

Al Safadi confirms this by a story of a grammarian named Abu  Jaafar, who sitting by the Mikyas or Nilometer in Egypt, in a year when the  Nile did not rise to its usual height, so that a famine was apprehended, and  dividing a piece of poetry into its parts or feet, to examine them by the  rules of art, some who passed by not understanding him, imagined he was  uttering a charm to hinder the rise of the river, and pushed him into the  water, where he lost his life.  9  Vide Clericum de Prosod.

I could produce many remarkable instances of  this commendable quality among them,5 but shall content myself with the  following.  Three men were disputing in the court of the Caaba, which was the  most liberal person among the Arabs.  One gave the preference to Abdallah, the  son of Jaafar, the uncle of Mohammed; another to Kais Ebn Saad Ebn Obâdah; and  the third gave it to Arâbah, of the tribe of Aws.  After much debate, one that  was present, to end the dispute, proposed that each of them should go to his  friend and ask his assistance, that they might see what every one gave, and  form a judgment accordingly.  This was agreed to; and Abdallah's friend, going  to him, found him with his foot in the stirrup, just mounting his camel for a  journey, and thus accosted him: \"Son of the uncle of the apostle of GOD, I am  travelling and in necessity.\"  Upon which Abdallah alighted, and bid him take  the camel with all that was upon her, but desired him not to part with a sword  which happened to be fixed to the saddle, because it had belonged to Ali, the  son of Abutâleb.  So he took the camel, and found on her some vests of silk  and 4,000 pieces of gold; but the thing of greatest value was the sword.  The  second went to Kais Ebn Saad, whose servant told him that his master was  asleep, and desired to know his business.  The friend answered that he came to  ask Kais's assistance, being in want on the road.  Whereupon the servant said  that he had rather supply his necessity than wake his master, and gave him a  purse of 7,000 pieces of gold, assuring him that it was all the money then in  the house.  He also directed him to go to those who had the charge of the  camels, with a certain token, and take a camel and a slave, and return home  with them.  When Kais awoke, and his servant informed him of what he had done,  he gave him his freedom, and asked him why he did not call him, \"For,\" says  he, \"I would have given him more.\"  The third man went to Arâbah, and met him  coming out of his house in order to go to prayers, and leaning on two slaves,  because his eyesight failed him.  The friend no sooner made known his case,  but Arâbah let go the slaves, and clapping his hands together, loudly lamented  his misfortune in having no money, but desired him to take the two slaves,  which the man refused to do, till Arâbah protested that if he would not accept  of them he gave them their liberty, and leaving the slaves, groped his way  along by the wall.  On the return of the adventurers, judgment was  unanimously, and with great justice, given by all who were present, that  Arâbah was the most generous of the three.     Nor were these the only good qualities of the Arabs; they are commended by  the ancients for being most exact to their words,1 and respectful to their  kindred.2  And they have always been celebrated for their quickness of  apprehension and penetration, and the vivacity of their wit, especially those  of the desert.3     As the Arabs have their excellencies, so have they, like other nations,  their defects and vices.  Their own writers acknowledge that they have       5  Several may be found in D'Herbelot's Bibl. Orient., particularly in the  articles of Hasan the son of Ali, Maan, Fadhel, and Ebn Yahya.  1  Herodot. l.3, c. 8.  2  Strabo, l. 16, p. 1129.  3  Vide  D'Herbel. Bibl. Orient. p. 121.          a natural disposition to war, bloodshed, cruelty, and rapine, being so much  addicted to bear malice that they scarce ever forget an old grudge; which  vindictive temper some physicians say is occasioned by their frequent feeding  on camel's flesh (the ordinary diet of the Arabs of the desert, who are  therefore observed to be most inclined to these vices), that creature being  most malicious and tenacious of anger,4 which account suggests a good reason  for a distinction of meats.     The frequent robberies committed by these people on merchants and  travellers have rendered the name of an Arab almost infamous in Europe; this  they are sensible of, and endeavour to excuse themselves by alleging the hard  usage of their father Ismael, who, being turned out of doors by Abraham, had  the open plains and deserts given him by GOD for his patrimony, with  permission to take whatever he could find there; and on this account they  think they may, with a safe conscience, indemnify themselves as well as they  can, not only on the posterity of Isaac, but also on everybody else, always  supposing a sort of kindred between themselves and those they plunder.  And in  relating their adventures of this kind, they think it sufficient to change the  expression, and instead of \"I robbed a man of such or such a thing,\" to say,  \"I gained it.\"1  We must not, however, imagine that they are the less honest  for this among themselves, or towards those whom they receive as friends; on  the contrary, the strictest probity is observed in their camp, where  everything is open and nothing ever known to be stolen.2     The sciences the Arabians chiefly cultivated before Mohammedism, were  three; that of their genealogies and history, such a knowledge of the stars as  to foretell the changes of weather, and the interpretation of dreams.3  They  used to value themselves excessively on account of the nobility of their  families, and so many disputes happened on that occasion, that it is no wonder  if they took great pains in settling their descents.  What knowledge they had  of the stars was gathered from long experience, and not from any regular  study, or astronomical rules.4  The Arabians, as the Indians also did, chiefly  applied themselves to observe the fixed stars, contrary to other nations,  whose observations were almost confined to the planets, and they foretold  their effects from their influences, not their nature; and hence, as has been  said, arose the difference of the idolatry of the Greeks and Chaldeans, who  chiefly worshipped the planets, and that of the Indians, who worshipped the  fixed star.  The stars or asterisms they most usually foretold the weather by,  were those they called Anwâ, or the houses of the moon.  These are 28 in  number, and divide the zodiac into as many parts, through one of which the  moon passes every night;5 as some of them set in the morning, others rise  opposite to them, which happens every thirteenth night; and from their rising  and setting, the Arabs, by long experience, observed what changes happened in  the air, and at length, as has been said, came to ascribe divine power to  them; saying, that their rain was from such or such a star: which expression  Mohammed condemned, and absolutely forbade them to use it in the old sense;       4  Vide Poc. Spec. p. 87, Bochart, Hierozoic. l. 2, c. I.  1  Voyage dans la Palest. p. 220, &c.  2  Ibid. p. 213, &c.  3  Al  Shahrestani, apud Pocock Orat. ubi sup. p. 9, and Spec. 164.  4  Abulfarag, p. 161.  5  Vide Hyde, in not. ad Tabulas stellar. fixar. Ulugh Beigh, p. 5.          unless they meant no more by it, than that GOD had so ordered the seasons,  that when the moon was in such or such a mansion or house, or at the rising or  setting of such and such a star, it should rain or be windy, hot or cold.1     The old Arabians therefore seem to have made no further progress in  astronomy, which science they afterwards cultivated with so much success and  applause, than to observe the influence of the stars on the weather, and to  give them names; and this it was obvious for them to do, by reason of their  pastoral way of life, lying night and day in the open plains.  The names they  imposed on the stars generally alluded to cattle and flocks, and they were so  nice in distinguishing them, that no language has so many names of stars and  asterisms as the Arabic; for though they have since borrowed the names of  several constellations from the Greeks, yet the far greater part are of their  own growth, and much more ancient, particularly those of the more conspicuous  stars, dispersed in several constellations, and those of the lesser  constellations which are contained within the greater, and were not observed  or named by the Greeks.2     Thus have I given the most succinct account I have been able, of the state  of the ancient Arabians before Mohammed, or, to use their expression, in the  time of ignorance.  I shall now proceed briefly to consider the state of  religion in the east, and of the two great empires which divided that part of  the world between them, at the time of Mohammed's setting up for a prophet,  and what were the conducive circumstances and accidents that favoured his  success.      _______      SECTION II.
