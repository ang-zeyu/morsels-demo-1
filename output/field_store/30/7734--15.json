[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#14)"],[1,"   warrior, but he was also an excellent ruler in time of peace. When he    was a boy he had shown his love of books. His mother once offered a    beautifully written Saxon poem as a prize to the one of her sons who    should be the first to learn it. Alfred could not yet read, but he had a    ready memory, and with the aid of his teacher he learned the poem and    won the prize.      At that time almost all books were written in Latin and few even of the    clergy could read. During the long wars with the Danes many books had    been destroyed. Men found battle-axes more useful than books and ceased    to care about reading. King Alfred feared that the Saxons would soon    become ignorant barbarians, and sent for priests and monks who were    learned and were able to teach his clergy. He sent even into France    for such men.    EARLY ENGLISH BOOKS. As it would be easier for people to learn to    read books written in the language they spoke rather than in Latin,    Alfred helped to translate several famous Latin books into English.    Among these was a history written by a Roman before the Germans had    overthrown the Roman Empire. This history told about the world of the    Greeks and the Romans.      Alfred commanded some of his clergy to keep a record from year to year    of things which happened in his kingdom. This record was called the    Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and was the first history written in the English    language. It was carefully kept for many years after Alfred's death.    Another wise thing Alfred did was to collect the laws or \"dooms\" of the    earlier kings, so that every one might know what the law required.      [Illustration: EXTRACT FROM THE SAXON CHRONICLE From a copy in    the British Museum]    THE BEGINNING OF A NAVY. Alfred has been called the creator of the    English navy. He thought that the only way to keep the Danes from    plundering his shores was to fight them on the sea. He built several    ships which were bigger than the Danish ships, but they were not always    victorious, for they could not follow the Danish ships into shallow    water. Nevertheless, the Danes could not plunder England as easily    as before.    THE NEW ARMY. Alfred organized his fighting men in a better way. In    times past the men had been called upon to fight only when the Danes    were near, but now he kept a third of his men ready all the time, and    another third he placed in forts, so the rest were able to work in the    fields in safety. There are good reasons why Englishmen regard Alfred    as a hero.    WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR BEGAN TO RULE ENGLAND IN 1066. About a    hundred and fifty years after Alfred died, William, duke of Normandy,    crossed the Channel with an army, killed the English king in battle, and    seized the throne. This was not altogether a misfortune to the English,    for they came under the same ruler as the Normans and they shared in all    that the men of the Continent were beginning to learn. For one thing,    builders from the Continent taught the English to construct the great    Norman churches or cathedrals which every traveler in England sees.    Besides, William the Conqueror was a strong king and put down the chiefs    or lords that were inclined to oppress the common people.    HENRY II. Henry II, one of William's successors, ruled over most of    western France as well as over England. His officers and nobles were    tired out by his endless traveling in his lands, which extended from the    banks of the river Loire in France to the borders of Scotland. All    Englishmen and Americans should remember him with gratitude because of    the improvements he made in the ways of discovering the truth when    disputes arose and were carried into courts.      [Illustration: THE NORMANS CROSSING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL From the    Bayeux Tapestry, embroidered in the time of William the Conqueror. The    figures are worked on a band of linen two hundred and thirty feet long,    and twenty inches wide. Worsteds of eight colors are used]    ORDEALS AND TRIALS BY BATTLE. Before Henry's reign it was the    custom when a man was accused of a crime to find out the truth by    arranging a wager of battle or what were called ordeals. The two most    common ordeals were the ordeal by fire and the ordeal by water. In the    ordeal by fire an iron was heated red-hot, and after it had been blessed    by a priest it was put into the hand of the man the truth of whose word    was being tested, and he had to carry it a certain number of feet. His    hand was then bound up and left for three days. If at the end of that    time the wound was healing, men believed he was innocent, for they    thought God would keep an innocent man from being punished.      In the ordeal by water the man was tied and thrown into water which had    been blessed by the priest. If he was guilty, the people thought the    water would not receive him. If he sank at once, he was pulled out and    treated as if he had told the truth.      [Illustration: TRIAL BY BATTLE After a drawing in an old    manuscript]      A wager of battle was a fight between the two men whose dispute was to    be settled, or between a man and his accuser. Each was armed with a    hammer or a small battle-axe, and the one who gave up lost his case.    TRIAL BY JURY. King Henry introduced a better way of finding out    the truth. He called upon twelve men from a neighborhood to come before    the judges, to promise solemnly to tell what they knew about a matter,    and then to decide which person was in the right. They were supposed to    know about the facts, and they were allowed to talk the matter over with    one another before they made a decision.      Later these men from the neighborhood were divided into two groups, one    to tell what they knew and the other to listen and decide what was true.    Those who told what they knew were called the witnesses, and those who    listened and decided were called jurors. The name jurors came from a    Latin word meaning to take an oath.    RICHARD THE LIONHEARTED. King Henry had two sons, Richard and John.    Richard was the boldest and most skilful fighter of his time. When the    news was brought to England that Jerusalem had been captured by the    Mohammedans, he led an army to Palestine to recapture it. He failed to    take the city, but he became famous throughout the East as a fearless    warrior and was ever afterwards called the \"Lionhearted.\" At his death    his brother John became king. He was as cowardly and wicked as Richard    was brave and generous.    THE GREAT CHARTER. The leaders of the people, the nobles and the    clergy, soon grew tired of John's wickedness. In 1215 they raised an    army and threatened to take the kingdom from John and crown another    prince as king. John was soon ready to promise anything in order to    obtain power once more, and the nobles and bishops met him at Runnymede    on the river Thames, a few miles west of London, and compelled him to    sign a list of promises. As the list contained sixty-three separate    promises, it was called the Great Charter or Magna Charta. If John did    not keep these promises, the lords and clergy agreed to make war on him,    and he even said that this would be their duty.    PROMISES OF THE CHARTER. Many of the articles of the Great Charter    were important only to the men of King John's day, but others are as    important to us as to them. In these the king promised that every one    should be treated justly. He said he would not refuse to listen to the    complaints of those who thought they were wronged. The king also    promised that he would not decide in favor of a rich man just because    the rich man might offer him money. He would put no one in prison who    had not been tried and found guilty by a jury. By another important    promise the king said he would not levy new taxes without the consent of    the chief men of the kingdom. This opened the way for the people to have    something to say about how their money should be spent. This right is a    very important part of what we call self-government.      [Illustration: A PORTION OF THE GREAT CHARTER]    PROMISES OF THE GREAT CHARTER RENEWED. In after times whenever the    English thought a king was doing them a wrong they reminded him of the    promises made by King John in the Great Charter and demanded that the    promises be solemnly renewed.      In 1265 a great noble named Simon de Montfort asked many towns to send a    number of their chief men to meet with the nobles and clergy to talk    over the conduct of the king. Others, even kings, soon followed Simon's    example by asking the townsmen for advice about matters of government.    After a while this became the custom. Occasionally the king wanted the    advice of the clergy, the nobles, and the townsmen at the same time and    called them together. The meeting was called a parliament, that is, an    assembly in which talking or discussion goes on.      [Illustration: Parliament House Westminster Hall Westminster    Abbey--WHERE PARLIAMENT MET IN LONDON IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]    THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT. Only the most important nobles or lords    could go in person to the assemblies, otherwise the meeting would be too    large to do any business. The other lords chose certain ones from their    number to go in place of all the rest. We call such men representatives.    In this way, besides the men who represented the towns, there were    present these nobles who represented the landowners of the counties.    Gradually these nobles and the townsmen formed an assembly of their own,    while the greater lords, the bishops, and abbots sat together in another    assembly. The two assemblies were called the House of Commons and the    House of Lords, and the two made up the parliament.    AN ASSEMBLY OF REPRESENTATIVES. This parliament was a great    invention. The English had discovered a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#14)"],[1," great man. Perhaps he was  coming to his room to form the posse and issue general instructions for  the chase.    The door opened. Dozier entered, jerked his head squarely to one side,  and found himself gazing into the muzzle of a revolver. The astonishment  and the swift hardening of his face had begun and ended in a fraction  of a second.    \"It's you, eh?\" he said, still holding the door.    \"Right,\" said Andrew. \"I'm here for a little chat about this Lanning  you're after.\"    Hal Dozier paused another heartbreaking second, then he saw that caution  was the better way. \"I'll have to shut you out for a minute or two,  boys. Go down to the bar and have a few on me.\" He turned, laughing and  waving to them. Then the door closed, and Dozier turned slowly to face  his hunted man. Into Andrew's mind came back the words of the great  outlaw, Allister: \"There's one man I'd think twice about meeting,  and that--\"    \"Sit down,\" said Andrew. \"And you can take off your belt if you want to.  Easy! That's it. Thank you.\"    The belt and the guns were tossed onto the bed, and Hal Dozier sat  down. He reminded Andrew of a terrier, not heavy, but all compact nerve  and fighting force.    \"I'll not frisk you for another gun,\" said Andrew.    \"Thanks; I have one, but I'll let it lie.\"    He made a movement. \"If you don't mind,\" said Andrew, \"I'd rather that  you don't reach into your pockets. Use my tobacco and papers, if you  wish.\" He tossed them onto the table, and Hal Dozier rolled his smoke in  silence. Then he tilted back in his chair a little. His hand with the  cigarette was as steady as a vise, and Andrew, shrugging forward his own  ponderous shoulders, dropped his elbows on his knees and trained the gun  full on his companion.    \"I've come to make a bargain, Dozier,\" he said.    The other made no comment, and the two continued that silent struggle of  the eyes that was making Andrew's throat dry and his heart leap.    \"Here's the bargain: Drop off this trail. Let the law take its own  course through other hands, but you give me your word to keep off the  trail. If you'll do that I'll leave this country and stay away. Except  for one thing, I'll never come back here. You're a proud man; you've  never quit a trail yet before the end of it. But this time I only ask  you to let it go with running me out of the country.\"    \"What's the one thing for which you'd come back?\"    \"I'll come back--once--because of a girl.\"    He saw the eyes of Dozier widen and then contract again. \"You're not  exactly what I expected to find,\" he said. \"But go on. If I don't take  the bargain you pull that trigger?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"H'm! You may have heard the voices of the men who came up the hall with  me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"The moment a report of a gun is heard they'll swarm up to this room and  get you.\"    \"They made too much noise. Barking dogs don't bite. Besides, the moment  I've dropped you I go out that window.\"    \"It's a good bluff, Lanning,\" said the other. \"I'll tell you what, if  you were what I expected you to be, a hysterical kid, who had a bit of  bad luck and good rolled together, I'd take that offer. But you're  different--you're a man. All in all, Lanning, I think you're about as  much of a man as I've ever crossed before. No, you won't pull that  trigger, because there isn't one deliberate murder packed away in your  system. It's a good bluff, as I said before, and I admire the way you  worked it. But it won't do. I call it. I won't leave your trail,  Lanning. Now pull your trigger.\"    He smiled straight into the eye of the younger man. A flush jumped into  the cheeks of Andrew, and, fading, left him by contrast paler than ever.  \"You were one-quarter of an inch from death, Dozier,\" he replied.    \"Lanning, with men like you--and like myself, I hope--there's no  question of distance. It's either a miss or a hit. Here's a better  proposition: Let me put my belt on again. Then put your own gun back in  the holster. We'll turn and face the wall. And when the clock downstairs  strikes ten--that'll be within a few minutes--we'll turn and blaze at  the first sound.\"    He watched his companion eagerly, and he saw the face of Andrew work. \"I  can't do it, Dozier,\" said Andrew. \"I'd like to. But I can't!\"    \"Why not?\" The voice of Hal Dozier was sharp with a new suspicion. \"Get  me out of the way, and you're free to get across the mountains, and,  once there, your trail will never be found. I know that; every one knows  that. That's why I hit up here after you.\"    \"I'll tell you why,\" said Andrew slowly. \"I've got the blood of one man  on my hands already, but, so help me God, I'm not going to have another  stain. I had to shoot once, because I was hounded into it. And, if this  thing keeps on, I'm going to shoot again--and again. But as long as I  can I'm fighting to keep clean, you understand?\"    His voice became thin and rose as he spoke; his breath was a series of  gasps, and Hal Dozier changed color.    \"I think,\" said Andrew, regaining his self-control, \"that I'd kill you.  I think I'm just a split second surer and faster than you are with a  gun. But don't you see, Dozier?\"    He cast out his left hand, but his right hand held the revolver like a  rock.    \"Don't you see? I've got the taint in me. I've killed my man. If I kill  another I'll go bad. I know it. Life will mean nothing to me. I can feel  it in me.\"    His voice fell and became deeper.    \"Dozier, give me my chance. It's up to you. Stand aside now, and I'll  get across those mountains and become a decent man. Keep me here, and  I'll be a killer. I know it; you know it. Why are you after me? Because  your brother was killed by me. Dozier, think of your brother and then  look at me. Was his life worth my life? You're a cool-headed man. You  knew him, and you knew what he was worth. His killings were as long as  the worst bad man that ever stepped, except that he had the law behind  him. When he got on my trail he knew that I was just a scared kid who  thought he'd killed a man. Why didn't he let me run until I found out  that I hadn't killed Buck Heath? Then he knew, and you know, that I'd  have come back. But he wouldn't give me the chance. He ran me into the  ground, and I shot him down. And that minute he turned me from a scared  kid into an outlaw--a killer. Tell me, man to man, Dozier, if Bill  hasn't already done me more wrong than I've done him!\"    As he finished that strange appeal he noted that the famous fighter was  white about the mouth and shaken. He added with a burst of appeal: \"Hal,  you know I'm straight. You know I'm worth a chance.\"    The older man lifted his head at last. \"Andy, I can't leave the trail.\"    At that sentence every muscle of Andrew's body relaxed, and he sat like  one in a state of collapse, except that the right hand and the gun in it  were steady as rocks.    \"Here's something between you and me that I'd swear I never said if I  was called in a court,\" went on Hal Dozier in a solemn murmur. \"I'll  tell you that I know Bill was no good. I've known it for years, and I've  told him so. It's Bill that bled me, and bled me until I've had to soak  a mortgage on the ranch. It's Bill that's spent the money on his cussed  booze and gambling. Until now there's a man that can squeeze and ruin me  any day, and that's Merchant. He sent me hot along this trail. He sent  me, but my pride sent me also. No, son, I wasn't bought altogether. And  if I'd known as much about you then as I know now, I'd never have  started to hound you. But now I've started. Everybody in the mountains,  every puncher on the range knows that Hal Dozier has started on a new  trail, and every man of them knows that I've never failed before. Andy,  I can't give it up. You see, I've got no shame before you. I tell you  the straight of it. I tell you that I'm a bought man. But I can't leave  this trail to go back and face the boys. If one of them was to shake his  head and say on the side that I'm no longer the man I used to be, I'd  shoot him dead as sure as there's a reckoning that I'm bound for. It  isn't you, Andy; it's my reputation that makes me go on.\"    He stopped, and the two men looked sadly at each other.    \"Andy, boy,\" said Hal Dozier, \"I've no more bad feeling toward you than  if you was my own boy.\" Then he added with a little ring to his voice:  \"But I'm going to stay on your trail till I kill you. You write that  down in red.\"    And the outlaw dropped his gun suddenly into the holster. \"That ends  it, then,\" he said slowly. \"The next time we meet we won't sit down and  chin friendly like. We'll let our guns do our talking for us. And, first  of all, I'm going to get across these mountains, Hal, in spite of you  and your friends.\"    \"You can't do it, Andy. Try it. I've sent the word up. The whole  mountains will be alive watchin' for you. Every trail will be alive  with guns.\"    But Andrew stood up, and, using always his left hand while the right arm  hung with apparent carelessness at his side, he arranged his hat so that  it came forward at a jaunty angle, and then hitched his belt around so  that the holster hung a little more to the rear. The position for a gun  when one is sitting is quite different from the proper position when one  is standing. All these things Uncle Jasper had taught Andrew long and  long before. He was remembering them in chunks.    \"Give me three minutes to get my saddle on my horse and out of town,\"  said Andrew. \"Is that fair?\"    \"Considering that you could have filled me full of lead here,\" said Hal  Dozier, with a wry smile, \"I think that's fair enough.\"          CHAPTER 18      As Andrew went down the stairs and through the entrance hall he noticed  it was filled with armed men. At the door he paused for the least  fraction of a second, and during that breathing space he had seen every  face in the room. Then he walked carelessly across to the desk and asked  for his bill.    Someone, as he crossed the room,"]]]
