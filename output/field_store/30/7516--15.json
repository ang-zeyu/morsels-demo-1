I shall begin with observing, that there is an evident absurdity in  pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact, or to prove it by any  arguments a priori. Nothing is demonstrable, unless the contrary implies  a contradiction. Nothing, that is distinctly conceivable, implies a  contradiction. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as  non-existent. There is no being, therefore, whose non-existence implies a  contradiction. Consequently there is no being, whose existence is  demonstrable. I propose this argument as entirely decisive, and am  willing to rest the whole controversy upon it.    It is pretended that the Deity is a necessarily existent being; and this  necessity of his existence is attempted to be explained by asserting,  that if we knew his whole essence or nature, we should perceive it to be  as impossible for him not to exist, as for twice two not to be four. But  it is evident that this can never happen, while our faculties remain the  same as at present. It will still be possible for us, at any time, to  conceive the non-existence of what we formerly conceived to exist; nor  can the mind ever lie under a necessity of supposing any object to remain  always in being; in the same manner as we lie under a necessity of always  conceiving twice two to be four. The words, therefore, necessary  existence, have no meaning; or, which is the same thing, none that is  consistent.    But further, why may not the material universe be the necessarily  existent Being, according to this pretended explication of necessity? We  dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of matter; and for aught  we can determine, it may contain some qualities, which, were they known,  would make its non-existence appear as great a contradiction as that  twice two is five. I find only one argument employed to prove, that the  material world is not the necessarily existent Being: and this argument  is derived from the contingency both of the matter and the form of the  world. \"Any particle of matter,\" it is said[]Dr. Clarke, \"may be conceived  to be annihilated; and any form may be conceived to be altered. Such an  annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not impossible.\" But it seems  a great partiality not to perceive, that the same argument extends  equally to the Deity, so far as we have any conception of him; and that  the mind can at least imagine him to be non-existent, or his attributes  to be altered. It must be some unknown, inconceivable qualities, which  can make his non-existence appear impossible, or his attributes  unalterable: And no reason can be assigned, why these qualities may not  belong to matter. As they are altogether unknown and inconceivable, they  can never be proved incompatible with it.    Add to this, that in tracing an eternal succession of objects, it seems  absurd to inquire for a general cause or first author. How can any thing,  that exists from eternity, have a cause, since that relation implies a  priority in time, and a beginning of existence?    In such a chain, too, or succession of objects, each part is caused by  that which preceded it, and causes that which succeeds it. Where then is  the difficulty? But the whole, you say, wants a cause. I answer, that the  uniting of these parts into a whole, like the uniting of several distinct  countries into one kingdom, or several distinct members into one body, is  performed merely by an arbitrary act of the mind, and has no influence on  the nature of things. Did I show you the particular causes of each  individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter, I should think  it very unreasonable, should you afterwards ask me, what was the cause of  the whole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in explaining the cause  of the parts.    Though the reasonings which you have urged, CLEANTHES, may well excuse  me, said PHILO, from starting any further difficulties, yet I cannot  forbear insisting still upon another topic. It is observed by  arithmeticians, that the products of 9, compose always either 9, or some  lesser product of 9, if you add together all the characters of which any  of the former products is composed. Thus, of 18, 27, 36, which are  products of 9, you make 9 by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6. Thus, 369 is  a product also of 9; and if you add 3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a lesser  product of 9. To a superficial observer, so wonderful a regularity may  be admired as the effect either of chance or design: but a skilful  algebraist immediately concludes it to be the work of necessity, and  demonstrates, that it must for ever result from the nature of these  numbers. Is it not probable, I ask, that the whole economy of the  universe is conducted by a like necessity, though no human algebra can  furnish a key which solves the difficulty? And instead of admiring the  order of natural beings, may it not happen, that, could we penetrate into  the intimate nature of bodies, we should clearly see why it was  absolutely impossible they could ever admit of any other disposition? So  dangerous is it to introduce this idea of necessity into the present  question! and so naturally does it afford an inference directly opposite  to the religious hypothesis!    But dropping all these abstractions, continued PHILO, and confining  ourselves to more familiar topics, I shall venture to add an observation,  that the argument a priori has seldom been found very convincing, except  to people of a metaphysical head, who have accustomed themselves to  abstract reasoning, and who, finding from mathematics, that the  understanding frequently leads to truth through obscurity, and, contrary  to first appearances, have transferred the same habit of thinking to  subjects where it ought not to have place. Other people, even of good  sense and the best inclined to religion, feel always some deficiency in  such arguments, though they are not perhaps able to explain distinctly  where it lies; a certain proof that men ever did, and ever will derive  their religion from other sources than from this species of reasoning.          PART 10      It is my opinion, I own, replied DEMEA, that each man feels, in a manner,  the truth of religion within his own breast, and, from a consciousness of  his imbecility and misery, rather than from any reasoning, is led to seek  protection from that Being, on whom he and all nature is dependent. So  anxious or so tedious are even the best scenes of life, that futurity is  still the object of all our hopes and fears. We incessantly look forward,  and endeavour, by prayers, adoration, and sacrifice, to appease those  unknown powers, whom we find, by experience, so able to afflict and  oppress us. Wretched creatures that we are! what resource for us amidst  the innumerable ills of life, did not religion suggest some methods of  atonement, and appease those terrors with which we are incessantly  agitated and tormented?    I am indeed persuaded, said PHILO, that the best, and indeed the only  method of bringing every one to a due sense of religion, is by just  representations of the misery and wickedness of men. And for that purpose  a talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more requisite than that of  reasoning and argument. For is it necessary to prove what every one feels  within himself? It is only necessary to make us feel it, if possible,  more intimately and sensibly.    The people, indeed, replied DEMEA, are sufficiently convinced of this  great and melancholy truth. The miseries of life; the unhappiness of man;  the general corruptions of our nature; the unsatisfactory enjoyment of  pleasures, riches, honours; these phrases have become almost proverbial  in all languages. And who can doubt of what all men declare from their  own immediate feeling and experience?    In this point, said PHILO, the learned are perfectly agreed with the  vulgar; and in all letters, sacred and profane, the topic of human misery  has been insisted on with the most pathetic eloquence that sorrow and  melancholy could inspire. The poets, who speak from sentiment, without a  system, and whose testimony has therefore the more authority, abound in  images of this nature. From Homer down to Dr. Young, the whole inspired  tribe have ever been sensible, that no other representation of things  would suit the feeling and observation of each individual.    As to authorities, replied DEMEA, you need not seek them. Look round this  library of CLEANTHES. I shall venture to affirm, that, except authors of  particular sciences, such as chemistry or botany, who have no occasion to  treat of human life, there is scarce one of those innumerable writers,  from whom the sense of human misery has not, in some passage or other,  extorted a complaint and confession of it. At least, the chance is  entirely on that side; and no one author has ever, so far as I can  recollect, been so extravagant as to deny it.    There you must excuse me, said PHILO: LEIBNIZ has denied it; and is  perhaps the first [That sentiment had been maintained by Dr. King and some  few others before Leibniz; though by none of so great a fame as that  German philosopher] who ventured upon so bold and paradoxical an opinion;  at least, the first who made it essential to his philosophical system.    And by being the first, replied DEMEA, might he not have been sensible of  his error? For is this a subject in which philosophers can propose to  make discoveries especially in so late an age? And can any man hope by a  simple denial (for the subject scarcely admits of reasoning), to bear  down the united testimony of mankind, founded on sense and consciousness?    And why should man, added he, pretend to an exemption from the lot of all  other animals? The whole earth, believe me, PHILO, is cursed and  polluted. A perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures.  Necessity, hunger, want, stimulate the strong and courageous: Fear,  anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and infirm. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#14)"],[1,"to receive such a  message than any other youth, because he was illiterate or poor, or  obscure, or rough and vulgar? This simple country youth told a tale  of what he had seen and heard, in the face of all the broad blazing  science and christianity of the nineteenth century; but was he any  less likely to be _the_ youth that the prophets saw and spoke of on  that account? Was it a marvellous tale that he told? so likewise was  the tale that the Virgin Mary told about her _offspring as begotten  of God_ the Father. Did the message that Joseph received, lead him to  disfellowship all the religious systems of the day, as incompatible  with the primitive pattern? so did Jesus, with the religions of his  day. But lest some lingering doubt should remain upon your mind,  whether the young man Joseph was the identical youth spoken of by  the prophets just named, you shall have other proofs until reason is  satisfied.    The prophet Daniel being greatly beloved of God, and of great faith,  saw this scene of the visitation of the angel to the _young_ man,  and the laying of the corner-stone of a millennial kingdom, and the  time of its organization, and calculated the same, to a day, as will  be developed in due time. Job wished that his words, or revelations  and history, were written with a pen of iron (the engraver's tool)  and laid in a rock. Now many of the prophets that lived and suffered  on the American continent, and settled that continent about the time  of the destruction of Jerusalem under Zedekiah, also wished _their_  words written and laid in rock or stone. By great faith they obtained  permission to have their records and prophecies laid up in _stone_,  being neatly engraved with a pen of iron, on plates of the most  enduring metal. Daniel saw this _stone_ that contained the records, and  spoke of it. Now this stone, containing the words of these prophets of  that \"_other fold_\" spoken of by Christ, had been buried about fourteen  hundred years previous to its discovery, probably to a considerable  depth in the earth, in what was then called the mountain of Cumorah.  Daniel's language is very remarkable in regard to the manner in which  this _stone_, with its contents, and connexion with the angelic  message, should come forth \"_out_ of the mountain _without hands_.\" The  stone probably, in consequence of the wear of the elements upon the  earth under the guidance of God, was gradually resurrected from the  depths of its burial, until it was literally _out_ of the mountain, and  visible without the aid of hands.    Oh! how marvellous, literal, and exact the fulfilment of Daniel's  prophecy! THE MOUNTAIN! THE VISIBILITY OF THE LONG BURIED STONE WITHOUT  HANDS! The contents of this stone, long harped upon by commentators,  joined with the whole of the angelic message foreseen by John and  Zechariah, were to lay the foundation of a kingdom that should extend  over the whole earth, and break in pieces all others, and never be  thrown down. Daniel not only saw the stone, and mountain, and _young_  man, and the whole beginning of this latter-day work, and calculated  the precise year and day of the month when the kingdom (not the coming  of Christ) should be set up; but he describes the small and weak  governments into which the four great universal governments should be  divided and subdivided. The governments that should exist on the earth  when this stone should be brought to light, would be, in comparison  with the four universal and potent governments of previous ages, as the  numerously divided toes of a man's feet in magnitude to his body.    When Jesus Christ came to organize the kingdom, the Romish government  was universal, and all the world were required to be taxed for its  support; consequently Daniel did not speak of _his_ organization, which  all the apostles saw and declared would be overcome. But he saw that  the kingdom which Christ would never take from the earth would be set  up, when the image of great kingdoms would be reduced to the simile of  mere toes, or petty kingdoms, just such as exist all over the earth  now--weak and small, and huddled together as thick as some of the  supernumerary toes of the feet of some ancient prodigies.    The kingdoms of this world, just precisely like the religions of this  world, are small, very numerous and contentious--all the present  governments of the earth being based on mixed, heterogenous, and  discordant principles, will readily crumble, like dry clay, before  the march of truth, until the dust thereof is carried away, and these  kingdoms and diversified religions are known only in the past. You,  sir, know very well whether the signs of the times fully indicate the  tottering state, and general disruption of all the governments of  the earth. But before I close this part of my subject, I will still  multiply the testimony of the prophets even further upon it.    Omitting Ezekiel, I will next introduce the testimony of Isaiah. This  prophet has probably said more on the re-establishment of the church  in the last days, and the surpassing glory of it than any other, and  deserves rather to be read as a whole than suffer mutilation from a  single extract or two. How any man can read Isaiah's testimony and  not see that an extraordinary scene, just like the one I have been  describing, was in full vision before him, it is difficult to explain,  except their hearts are waxed gross and dull to perceive, and the veil  remains untaken away in reading the Old Testament prophecies.    Instead of citing passages of scripture verbatim, I will here name  topics, which Isaiah distinctly exhibited, bearing directly upon the  subject at issue. First, he speaks unequivocally of an extraordinary  BOOK, and says it would be a \"_sealed_ book,\" that neither the learned  or unlearned could read. Second, in the context, he gives a cutting  rebuke, because there is no prophet or seer to read it; and administers  a most withering reproof to the religious world, that draw near to Him  with their lips, and honour Him with their mouths only; and for lack of  the spirit of _revelation and prophecy_, resort to their own ingenuity  of teaching the fear of the Lord by human precepts. Third, he says, the  \"_vision_\" of all is become as a BOOK that is sealed which cannot be  read. How is this, sir, that the prophecies and revelations of _all_  are locked up in a book, that neither learned nor unlearned can read,  and the men that uttered them, prophets and seers, are covered--shut  out from the knowledge of mankind?    The visions of the Old and New Testament are so plainly legible in many  books, that he who runs may read. Those who had these latter visions,  instead of being covered or unknown, are well known, and preached every  Sabbath day. Don't shrink from this issue, sir, but meet it like one  who feels his destiny to be suspended on a correct faith in revealed  truth. What mysterious collection of visions, arranged into the form  of a BOOK, that no uninspired man can read, IS THIS? It must be the  visions of _some_ prophets and seers, that have lived and prophesied  to _some_ people, that have now faded from the knowledge of men.  Mankind is ignorant of them. And when the BOOK, that contains their  _records_ is found (taken out of the earth, as I shall show by Isaiah's  testimony), no man can read it or is the wiser for it (unless God  reveals it).    Now, sir, as you are a teacher, professing to be sent from God, I again  ask, whose visions are all these, so curiously wrapped up in a BOOK,  and sealed too, and kept hid from the knowledge of mankind? You will  not deny that the prophet saw a _book_, containing important records  of some certain unknown prophets and seers. But if you believe the  prophet, as I know you do, and humbly acknowledge, that you cannot tell  what this mysterious BOOK of RECORDS means; then, by the spirit and  blessing of God, I will further endeavour to show that it is the same  that the angel announced to the young man Joseph.    This mysterious BOOK of records was found in that identical _stone_,  spoken of by Daniel the prophet. The prophets and seers, whose records  constitute that book, lived among a mighty nation on the American  continent, whose history is as important as that of other continents in  its place.    Another topic dwelt upon by Isaiah is, that \"truth\" (plainly alluding  to this book of inspired records) should \"_speak out of the ground_,  and thy speech shall be low _out of the dust_, and thy voice shall be  as of one that hath a familiar spirit _out of the ground_, and thy  speech shall whisper _out of the dust_.\"    Is it a marvellous thing that this wonderful book of the visions of all  the American seers should be so skilfully entombed in _stone_, and then  buried in the earth? Where should they have deposited it, so that it  could have answered the purpose intended, so well as in the ground? How  could the STONE, containing it, ever have been CUT OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN  WITHOUT HANDS, if it had never been put _into the mountain_? Isaiah  says, the people should be besieged and brought _low_ (nearly all were  slain), but by the records of their seers should, after a long time,  speak _out_ of the ground, and their records should be as the voice  of a familiar spirit. Who, sir, that has read them does not clearly  perceive that they speak familiarly of things past, present, and to  come? So truly do these records speak of what shall transpire, after  the BOOK has been shewn to them, that many have slanderously said, that  it was written by an eye witness of the things spoken of. It speaks  also of the ruins of cities--of antiquities since discovered on the  American continent, by travellers and antiquarians, that have excited  the curiosity and wonder of the world.    This Book of Mormon, is one of the most unexceptionable and  God-honouring books that was ever published to the world. An uninspired  man might as well "]]]
