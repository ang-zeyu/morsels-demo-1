Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#14)"],[1,"the thirteenth at table, or to choose a house  numbered 13 fearless of any croaking about flying in the face of what  is humorously called \"Providence.\"    Looking towards the Carpathia in the faint light, we saw what seemed  to be two large fully rigged sailing ships near the horizon, with all  sails set, standing up near her, and we decided that they must be  fishing vessels off the Banks of Newfoundland which had seen the  Carpathia stop and were waiting to see if she wanted help of any kind.  But in a few minutes more the light shone on them and they stood  revealed as huge icebergs, peaked in a way that readily suggested a  ship. When the sun rose higher, it turned them pink, and sinister as  they looked towering like rugged white peaks of rock out of the sea,  and terrible as was the disaster one of them had caused, there was an  awful beauty about them which could not be overlooked. Later, when the  sun came above the horizon, they sparkled and glittered in its rays;  deadly white, like frozen snow rather than translucent ice.    As the dawn crept towards us there lay another almost directly in the  line between our boat and the Carpathia, and a few minutes later,  another on her port quarter, and more again on the southern and  western horizons, as far as the eye could reach: all differing in  shape and size and tones of colour according as the sun shone through  them or was reflected directly or obliquely from them.    [Illustration: THE CARPATHIA]    We drew near our rescuer and presently could discern the bands on her  funnel, by which the crew could tell she was a Cunarder; and already  some boats were at her side and passengers climbing up her ladders. We  had to give the iceberg a wide berth and make a detour to the south:  we knew it was sunk a long way below the surface with such things as  projecting ledges--not that it was very likely there was one so near  the surface as to endanger our small boat, but we were not inclined to  take any risks for the sake of a few more minutes when safety lay so  near.    Once clear of the berg, we could read the Cunarder's name--C A R P A T  H I A--a name we are not likely ever to forget. We shall see her  sometimes, perhaps, in the shipping lists,--as I have done already  once when she left Genoa on her return voyage,--and the way her lights  climbed up over the horizon in the darkness, the way she swung and  showed her lighted portholes, and the moment when we read her name on  her side will all come back in a flash; we shall live again the scene  of rescue, and feel the same thrill of gratitude for all she brought  us that night.    We rowed up to her about 4.30, and sheltering on the port side from  the swell, held on by two ropes at the stern and bow. Women went up  the side first, climbing rope ladders with a noose round their  shoulders to help their ascent; men passengers scrambled next, and the  crew last of all. The baby went up in a bag with the opening tied up:  it had been quite well all the time, and never suffered any ill  effects from its cold journey in the night. We set foot on deck with  very thankful hearts, grateful beyond the possibility of adequate  expression to feel a solid ship beneath us once more.          CHAPTER VI    THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC SEEN FROM HER DECK      The two preceding chapters have been to a large extent the narrative  of a single eyewitness and an account of the escape of one boat only  from the Titanic's side. It will be well now to return to the Titanic  and reconstruct a more general and complete account from the  experiences of many people in different parts of the ship. A  considerable part of these experiences was related to the writer first  hand by survivors, both on board the Carpathia and at other times, but  some are derived from other sources which are probably as accurate as  first-hand information. Other reports, which seemed at first sight to  have been founded on the testimony of eyewitnesses, have been found on  examination to have passed through several hands, and have therefore  been rejected. The testimony even of eye-witnesses has in some cases  been excluded when it seemed not to agree with direct evidence of a  number of other witnesses or with what reasoned judgment considered  probable in the circumstances. In this category are the reports of  explosions before the Titanic sank, the breaking of the ship in two  parts, the suicide of officers. It would be well to notice here that  the Titanic was in her correct course, the southerly one, and in the  position which prudence dictates as a safe one under the ordinary  conditions at that time of the year: to be strictly accurate she was  sixteen miles south of the regular summer route which all companies  follow from January to August.    Perhaps the real history of the disaster should commence with the  afternoon of Sunday, when Marconigrams were received by the Titanic  from the ships ahead of her, warning her of the existence of icebergs.  In connection with this must be taken the marked fall of temperature  observed by everyone in the afternoon and evening of this day as well  as the very low temperature of the water. These have generally been  taken to indicate that without any possibility of doubt we were near  an iceberg region, and the severest condemnation has been poured on  the heads of the officers and captain for not having regard to these  climatic conditions; but here caution is necessary. There can be  little doubt now that the low temperature observed can be traced to  the icebergs and ice-field subsequently encountered, but experienced  sailors are aware that it might have been observed without any  icebergs being near. The cold Labrador current sweeps down by  Newfoundland across the track of Atlantic liners, but does not  necessarily carry icebergs with it; cold winds blow from Greenland and  Labrador and not always from icebergs and ice-fields. So that falls in  temperature of sea and air are not prima facie evidence of the close  proximity of icebergs. On the other hand, a single iceberg separated  by many miles from its fellows might sink a ship, but certainly would  not cause a drop in temperature either of the air or water. Then, as  the Labrador current meets the warm Gulf Stream flowing from the Gulf  of Mexico across to Europe, they do not necessarily intermingle, nor  do they always run side by side or one on top of the other, but often  interlaced, like the fingers of two hands. As a ship sails across this  region the thermometer will record within a few miles temperatures of  34 deg., 58 deg., 35 deg., 59 deg., and so on.    It is little wonder then that sailors become accustomed to place  little reliance on temperature conditions as a means of estimating the  probabilities of encountering ice in their track. An experienced  sailor has told me that nothing is more difficult to diagnose than the  presence of icebergs, and a strong confirmation of this is found in  the official sailing directions issued by the Hydrographic Department  of the British Admiralty. \"No reliance can be placed on any warning  being conveyed to the mariner, by a fall in temperature, either of sea  or air, of approaching ice. Some decrease in temperature has  occasionally been recorded, but more often none has been observed.\"    But notification by Marconigram of the exact location of icebergs is a  vastly different matter. I remember with deep feeling the effect this  information had on us when it first became generally known on board  the Carpathia. Rumours of it went round on Wednesday morning, grew to  definite statements in the afternoon, and were confirmed when one of  the Titanic officers admitted the truth of it in reply to a direct  question. I shall never forget the overwhelming sense of hopelessness  that came over some of us as we obtained definite knowledge of the  warning messages. It was not then the unavoidable accident we had  hitherto supposed: the sudden plunging into a region crowded with  icebergs which no seaman, however skilled a navigator he might be,  could have avoided! The beautiful Titanic wounded too deeply to  recover, the cries of the drowning still ringing in our ears and the  thousands of homes that mourned all these calamities--none of all  these things need ever have been!    It is no exaggeration to say that men who went through all the  experiences of the collision and the rescue and the subsequent scenes  on the quay at New York with hardly a tremor, were quite overcome by  this knowledge and turned away, unable to speak; I for one, did so,  and I know others who told me they were similarly affected.    I think we all came to modify our opinions on this matter, however,  when we learnt more of the general conditions attending trans-Atlantic  steamship services. The discussion as to who was responsible for these  warnings being disregarded had perhaps better be postponed to a later  chapter. One of these warnings was handed to Mr. Ismay by Captain  Smith at 5 P.M. and returned at the latter's request at 7 P.M., that  it might be posted for the information of officers; as a result of the  messages they were instructed to keep a special lookout for ice. This,  Second Officer Lightoller did until he was relieved at 10 P.M. by  First Officer Murdock, to whom he handed on the instructions. During  Mr. Lightoller's watch, about 9 P.M., the captain had joined him on  the bridge and discussed \"the time we should be getting up towards the  vicinity of the ice, and how we should recognize it if we should see  it, and refreshing our minds on the indications that ice gives when it  is in the vicinity.\" Apparently, too, the officers had discussed among  themselves the proximity of ice and Mr. Lightoller had remarked that  they would be approaching the position where ice had been reported  during his watch. The lookouts were cautioned similarly, but no ice  was sighted until a few minutes before the collision, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#14)"],[1,"in a covered dish.      PEACH CORDIAL.    Take a peck of cling-stone peaches; such as come late in the  season, and are very juicy. Pare them, and cut them from the  stones. Crack about half the stones and save the kernels. Leave  the remainder of the stones whole, and mix them with the cut  peaches; add also the kernels. Put the whole into a wide-mouthed  demi-john, and pour on them two gallons of double-rectified  whiskey. Add three pounds of rock-sugar candy. Cork it tightly,  and set It away for three months: then bottle it, and it will be  fit for use. This cordial is as clear as water, and nearly equal  to noyau.      CHERRY BOUNCE.    Take a peck of morella cherries, and a peck of black hearts. Stone  the morellas and crack the stones. Put all the cherries and the  cracked stones into a demi-john, with three pounds of loaf-sugar  slightly pounded or beaten. Pour in two gallons of double-rectified  whiskey. Cork the demi-john, and in six months the cherry-bounce  will be fit to pour off and bottle for use; but the older it is,  the better.      RASPBERRY CORDIAL.    To each quart of raspberries allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Mash the  raspberries and strew the sugar over them, having first pounded it  slightly, or cracked it with the rolling-pin. Let the raspberries  and sugar set till next day, keeping them well covered, then put  them in a thin linen bag and squeeze out the juice with your  hands. To every pint of juice allow a quart of double-rectified  whiskey. Cork it well, and set it away for use. It will be ready  in a few days.    Raspberry Vinegar (which, mixed with water, is a pleasant and  cooling beverage in warm weather) is made exactly in the same  manner as the cordial, only substituting the best white vinegar  for the whiskey.      BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.    Take the ripest blackberries. Mash them, put them in a linen bag  and squeeze out the juice. To every quart of juice allow a pound  of beaten loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a large preserving  kettle, and pour the juice on it. When it is all melted, set it on  the fire, and boil it to a thin jelly. When cold, to every quart  of juice allow a quart of brandy. Stir them well together, and  bottle it for use. It will be ready at once.      GINGER BEER.    Put into a kettle, two ounces of powdered ginger,(or more if it is  not very strong,) half an ounce of cream of tartar, two large  lemons cut in slices, two pounds of broken loaf-sugar, and one  gallon of soft water. Simmer them over a slow fire for half an  hour. When the liquor is nearly cold, stir into it a large  table-spoonful of the best yeast. After it has fermented, bottle  for use.      JELLY CAKE.    Stir together till very light, half a pound of fresh butter and  half a pound of powdered white sugar. Beat twelve eggs very light,  and stir them into the butter and sugar, alternately with a pound  of sifted flour. Add a beaten nutmeg, and half a wine-glass of  rose-water. Have ready a flat circular plate of tin, which must be  laid on your griddle, or in the oven of your stove, and well  greased with butter. Pour on it a large ladle-full of the batter,  and bake it as you would a buck-wheat cake, taking care to have it  of a good shape. It will not require turning. Bake as many of  these cakes as you want, laying each on a separate plate. Then  spread jelly or marmalade all over the top of each cake, and lay  another upon it. Spread that also with jelly, and so on till you  have a pile of five or six, looking like one large thick cake.  Trim the edge nicely with a penknife, and cover the top with  powdered sugar. Or you may ice it; putting on the nonpareils or  sugar-sand in such a manner as to mark out the cake in triangular  divisions. When it is to be eaten, cut it in three-cornered slices  as you would a pie.      COLOURING FOR ICING, &c.    _To make a red colouring for icing_. Take twenty grains of  cochineal powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty  grains of powdered alum. Put them into gill of cold soft water,  and boil it very slowly till reduced to one half. Strain it  through thin muslin, and cork it up for use. A very small quantity  of this mixture will colour icing of a beautiful pink. With pink  icing, white nonpareils should be used.      RICE CAKES FOR BREAKFAST.    Put half a pound of rice in soak over night. Early in the morning  boil it very soft, drain it from the water, mix with it a quarter  of a pound of butter, and set it away to cool. When it is cold,  stir it into a quart of milk, and add a very little salt. Beat six  eggs, and sift half a pint of flour. Stir the egg and flour  alternately into the rice and milk. Having beaten the whole very  well, bake it on the griddle in cakes about the size of a small  dessert-plate. Butter them, and send them to table hot.      GROUND RICE PUODIJVG.    Take five table-spoonfuls of ground rice and boil it in a quart of  new milk, with a grated nutmeg or a tea-spoonful of powdered  cinnamon, stirring it all the time. When it has boiled, pour it  into a pan and stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, and a  quarter of a pound of powdered sugar, a nutmeg and half a pint of  cream. Set it away to get cold. Then heat eight eggs, omitting the  whites of four. Have ready a pound of dried currants well cleaned,  and sprinkled with flour; stir them into the mixture alternately  with the beaten egg. Add half a glass of rose-water, or half a  glass of mixed wine and brandy. Butter a deep dish, put in the  mixture, and hake it of a pale brown. Or you may bake it in  saucers.      TOMATA KETCHUP.    Slice the tomatas. Put them in layers into a deep earthen pan, and  sprinkle every layer with salt. Let them stand in this state for  twelve hours. Then put them over the fire in a preserving kettle,  and simmer them till they are quite soft. Pour them into a linen  bag, and squeeze the juice from them. Season the liquor to your  taste, with grated horse-radish, a little garlic, some mace, and a  few cloves. Boil it well with these ingredients--and, when cold,  bottle it for use.      YEAST    Have ready two quarts of boiling water; put into it a large  handful of hops, and let them boil twenty minutes. Sift into a pan  a pound and a half of flour. Strain the liquor from the hops, and  pour half of it over the flour. Let the other half of the liquid  stand till it is cool, and then pour it gradually into the pan of  flour, mixing it well. Stir into it a large tea-cup full of good  yeast,(brewer's yeast if you can get it.) Put it immediately into  bottles, and cork it tightly. It will be fit for use in an hour.  It will be much improved and keep longer, by putting into each  bottle a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash."]]]
