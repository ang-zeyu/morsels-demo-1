On arriving at the Exposition Grounds the following morning, we observed  that--in spite of the early hour--the promenades were unusually  frequented. This fact was due to the celebration of the Illinois Day which  had attracted a multitude of citizens from Chicago and environs. In  accordance with our unanimous desire--to first view the interior of the  largest edifice, we entered one of its four great entrances designed in  the manner of triumphal arches. The MANUFACTURES BUILDING was erected for  the purpose of accommodating all classes of leading industries--the  products of modern machinery and man's skillful handiwork--which, in this  epoch of constant progress, have attained a high stage of perfection. And  comparing the achievements of the present age with those recorded in the  annals of history, proves that opinion.    Having stepped into the central aisle at the northern end of the mammoth  structure, we found ourselves in a broad street, called Columbia Avenue.  Glancing around, we were dazzled by the resplendent glory of an aspect  almost overpowering. The fine display included those exhibits which  exemplified most advantageously the modern industrial progress made by the  various nations on the globe. Artistic pavilions, oriental pagodas, and  quaint kiosks had been provided for most of the exhibits. The United  States section--covering the entire range of manufactures, and extending  from the extreme northwestern corner to the avenue east and west--evinced  the high rank of the Union in the industrial world in consequence of its  uncommon wealth, and the inventive genius of Americans in the production  of labor-saving devices and improved machinery.    All the great firms were represented, commending the abnormal variety of  domestic industries. It was, indeed, a matter of difficulty to decide  which of them was paramount. Tiffany's costly exhibits in jewels,  especially diamonds, housed in a beautiful pavilion, attracted the  visitor's eyes.    Opposite this structure, Germany had a stately building. Gobelin  tapestries and handsome furniture adorned its interior. The elegant rooms  were modeled after the reception _salon_ of the Imperial Palace in Berlin,  and that of King Louis of Bavaria. All the various products of industrial  pursuits--inclosed in this pavilion--manifested the intelligence and  dexterity of the German nation.    Austria had a rich display, principally in jewelry and ornamental  decorations, in an adjoining edifice. A splendid collection, including  everything in the line of manufactures, was shown in the English Pavilion,  which rose south of the German exhibits. Facing the former, France  occupied a structure whose walls were adorned with costly tapestries, and  whose ceramic, furniture, and household decorations were worthy of the  highest admiration. Next to the Belgian section a sumptuous pavilion  housed an enormous outlay of diverse Russian manufactures.    At the southern end of Columbia Avenue a magnificent building formed the  gateway to a rich collection of Italian art ware and industries. The  handsome Spanish Pavilion was succeeded by typically Persian exhibits  consisting prominently of carpets, curtains, silk needlework, and  tapestries. Mexico, the land of _ma√±ana_ and _poco tiempo_ was represented  by costly decorations and art feather-work. The facade of the Siamese  structure--close by--covered with gold leaf, was imposing and attractive.  Displays of manufactured goods had been made by scores of other countries,  all of which to enumerate would be an impossibility.    As we reached the northwestern portion of the gigantic building, we were  delighted with the sight of the Japanese Pavilion, one of the most  valuable structures. Upon its construction the Japanese government had  expended a great amount of money. The superb exhibits in works of art,  bric-a-brac, and other exquisite manufactures brought to view by this  nation, evinced an eminent talent and great ingenuity.    The Mikado--to whom is due the rapid progress civilization has made in his  country within the last ten years--was the first of the foreign monarchs  to demonstrate an active interest in the exposition.    The melodious chimes resounding from the belfry of a clock-tower in the  center of Columbia Avenue, caused us to take notice of the rapidly  elapsing time. To our surprise, the immense time-piece indicated an  advanced hour in the afternoon.    We could not abandon the superb temple, so amply filled with the products  of human industry, embracing that which was regally magnificent, as well  as that most applicable to our daily needs--without an enthusiastic  thrill. If man is weak in many things, he is also grand in much; and every  thoughtful observer must have paused upon this threshold to pay a tribute  to that untiring energy which must make the world better for its existence  and progress.    We entered the next great structure to the northwest. Here, the GOVERNMENT  of the UNITED STATES from its Executive Departments, the Smithsonian  Institution, the U.S. Fish Commission, and the National Museum, exhibited  such articles and materials as illustrate the function and administrative  faculty of the government in time of piece, as well as its resources as a  war power.    Taking the south-entrance, our attention was first turned to the  collection of the Smithsonian exhibits. They showed the results of  scientific investigations during the forty-seven years of its existence,  and the scope of its work.    The contributions from the National Museum represented the natural  resources of the United States: Rare specimens of the American fauna;  illustrations showing the geological variations within the limits of the  United States and the utilization of nature's rich gifts bestowed upon  this country. This department gave us occasion to obtain an entire idea of  the enormous melioration, arts and industries have experienced in modern  times--by means of exhibits demonstrating the history and development of  ceramics, graphic arts, musical instruments; as well as many important  trades from the most primitive stages to the present day. Here also were  interesting studies in ethnology, prehistoric anthropology, archeology,  religious ceremonials, zoology, mineralogy, and geology.    The Treasury Department--more westward--contained models, pictures,  charts, and diagrams elucidating the Marine Hospital Service, Coast and  Geodetic Survey, the Mint of the United States, the Bureau of Engraving  and Printing, the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment, the Bureau of Internal  Revenue, the Register's Office, and the Bureau of Statistics.    In the adjoining division assigned to the Postoffice, we could trace the  subject of transportation which plays so prominent a part in the history  of civilization--by means of models, drawings, and pictures from the most  incipient stages to the modern uses of steam and electricity.    The northwestern portion of this interesting building was given up to the  Department of the Interior; embracing the Patent Office, the Bureau of  Education, the Census Office, and the U.S. Geological Survey.    In the rotunda we viewed the \"_Big Tree_,\" a section thirty feet in  length, cut from Sequoia Gigantea, a tree 300 feet high whose diameter at  the base covered a space of twenty-six feet. It grew in the Sequoia  National Park in the charming clime of California. Under the central dome  were also shown 138 colonial exhibits--relics of historic value from days  long gone by.    The War Department was well represented in all its branches; regarding  uniforms and equipage, means of transportation, military engineering,  shooting apparatuses, ammunition, etc.    Having visited the State and Justice Departments, we repaired to the  division in which the government displayed (in the Department of  Agriculture) a very complete and comprehensively arranged collection of  grains obtained in this and other countries.    Very interesting were the adjacent exhibits, presenting to view the topics  of food adulteration, entomology, pomology, botany, ornithology, and  mammalogy; together with experiments in fibre investigation.    Betaking ourselves to the northern division, we were instructed--by  various illustrations--of the methods employed by the scientific branch of  the Fish Commission in determining the habits, peculiar to denizens of  water. Models and apparatuses showed the results of Fish Culture.    The displays in this unique building covering almost all the branches of  modern science and arts, bore testimony to the fact that the United States  now rank with the most powerful nations on the globe; and to this  attainment only a little more than one century of development was  requisite. This says everything for American enterprise and genius--and a  country so young in a very old world.    The circumstance of its being a calm evening--with the prospect of a  pyrotechnic display later--permitted us to remain on the Fair Grounds  longer than we usually did; hence we determined to visit still another  structure.    By crossing a bridge over the lagoon, we arrived at the _Fisheries  Building_. In the main edifice we first saw fishing-tackles, nets, and  other apparatuses used by fishermen, and shown by the American Net and  Twine Co. The contiguous space to the right was given up to the exhibits  of several States in the Union, especially noted for fisheries, and of  various foreign countries as Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, France, Great  Britain, Russia, and Norway. Walking through a curved arcade, we beheld on  either side aquaria of an enormous capacity, inclosing both denizens of  fresh and salt water. It is safe to say the display of aquatic life made  here, could rival the greatest permanent aquaria in existence;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#15)"],[1,"whom the gods proceeded.

THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.        The Chapter of the divine (or, mighty) god, who created himself, who  made the heavens and the earth, and the breath of life, and fire, and  the gods, and men, and beasts, and cattle, and reptiles, and the fowl  of the air, and the fish, who is the king of men and gods, [who  existeth] in one Form, [to whom] periods of one hundred and twenty  years axe as single years, whose names by reason of their multitude are  unknowable, for [even] the gods know them not.  Behold, the goddess  Isis lived in the form, of a woman, who had the knowledge of words [of  power].  Her heart turned away in disgust from the millions of men, and  she chose for herself the millions of the gods, but esteemed more  highly the millions of the spirits.  Was it not possible to become even  as was Ra in heaven and upon earth, and to make [herself] mistress of  the earth, and a [mighty] goddess--thus she meditated in her heart--by  the knowledge of the Name of the holy god?  Behold, Ra entered [heaven]  each day at the head of his mariners, establishing himself upon the  double throne of the two horizons. Now the divine one had become old,  he dribbled at the mouth, and he let his emissions go forth from him  upon the earth, and his spittle fell upon the ground.  This Isis  kneaded in her hand,[FN#66] with [some] dust, and she fashioned it in  the form of a sacred serpent, and made it to have the form of a dart,  so that none might be able to escape alive from it, and she left it  lying upon the road whereon the great god travelled, according to his  desire, about the two lands.  Then the holy god rose up in the  tabernacle of the gods in the great double house (life, strength,  health!) among those who were in his train, and [as] he journeyed on  his way according to his daily wont, the holy serpent shot its fang  into him, and the living fire was departing from the god's own body,  and the reptile destroyed the dweller among the cedars. And the mighty  god opened his mouth, and the cry of His Majesty (life, strength,  health!) reached unto the heavens, and the company of the gods said,  \"What is it?\" and his gods said, \"What is the matter?\"  And the god  found [no words] wherewith to answer concerning himself.  His jaws  shook, his lips trembled, and the poison took possession of all his  flesh just as Hapi (i.e., the Nile) taketh possession of the land  through which he floweth.  Then the great god made firm his heart  (i.e., took courage) and he cried out to those who were in his  following:--\"Come ye unto me, O ye who have come into being from my  members,[FN#67] ye gods who have proceeded from me, for I would make  you to know what hath happened.  I have been smitten by some deadly  thing, of which my heart hath no knowledge, and which I have neither  seen with my eyes nor made with my hand; and I have no knowledge at all  who hath done this to me.  I have never before felt any pain like unto  it, and no pain can be worse than this [is].  I am a Prince, the son of  a Prince, and the divine emanation which was produced from a god.  I am  a Great One, the son of a Great One, and my father hath determined for  me my name.  I have multitudes of names, and I have multitudes of  forms, and my being existeth in every god.  I have been invoked (or,  proclaimed?) by Temu and Heru-Hekennu.  My father and my mother uttered  my name, and [they] hid it in my body at my birth so that none of those  who would use against me words of power might succeed in making their  enchantments have dominion over me.[FN#68] I had come forth from my  tabernacle to look upon that which I had made, and was making my way  through the two lands which I had made, when a blow was aimed at me,  but I know not of what kind.  Behold, is it fire?  Behold, is it water?  My heart is full of burning fire, my limbs are shivering, and my  members have darting pains in them.  Let there be brought unto me my  children the gods, who possess words of magic, whose mouths are cunning  [in uttering them], and whose powers reach up to heaven.\"  Then his  children came unto him, and every god was there with his cry of  lamentation; and Isis[FN#69] came with her words of magic, and the  place of her mouth [was filled with] the breath of life, for the words  which she putteth together destroy diseases, and her words make to live  those whose throats are choked (i.e., the dead).  And she said, \"What  is this, O divine father?  What is it?  Hath a serpent shot his venom  into thee?  Hath a thing which thou hast fashioned lifted up its head  against thee?  Verily it shall be overthrown by beneficent words of  power, and I will make it to retreat in the sight of thy rays.\"  The  holy god opened his mouth, [saying], I was going along the road and  passing through the two lands of my country, for my heart wished to  look upon what I had made, when I was bitten by a serpent which I did  not see; behold, is it fire?  Behold, is it water?  I am colder than  water, I am hotter than fire, all my members sweat, I myself quake,  mine eye is unsteady.  I cannot look at the heavens, and water forceth  itself on my face as in the time of the Inundation.\"[FN#70]  And Isis  said unto Ra, \"O my divine father, tell me thy name, for he who is able  to pronounce his name liveth.\"  [And Ra said], \"I am the maker of the  heavens and the earth, I have knit together the mountains, and I have  created everything which existeth upon them.  I am the maker of the  Waters, and I have made Meht-ur to come into being; I have made the  Bull of his Mother, and I have made the joys of love to exist.  I am  the maker of heaven, and I have made to be hidden the two gods of the  horizon, and I have placed the souls of the gods within them.  I am the  Being who openeth his eyes and the light cometh; I am the Being who  shutteth his eyes and there is darkness.  I am the Being who giveth the  command, and the waters of Hapi (the Nile) burst forth, I am the Being  whose name the gods know not.  I am the maker of the hours and the  creator of the days.  I am the opener (i.e., inaugurator) of the  festivals, and the maker of the floods of water.  I am the creator of  the fire of life whereby the works of the houses are caused to come  into being. I am Khepera in the morning, and Ra (at the time of his  culmination (i.e., noon), and Temu in the evening.\"[FN#71]  Nevertheless the poison was not driven from its course, and the great  god felt no better.  Then Isis said unto Ra, \"Among the things which  thou hast said unto me thy name hath not been mentioned.  O declare  thou it unto me, and the poison shall come forth; for the person who  hath declared his name shall live.\"  Meanwhile the poison burned with  blazing fire and the heat thereof was stronger than that of a blazing  flame.  Then the Majesty of Ra, said, \"I will allow myself to be  searched through by Isis, and my name shall come forth from my body and  go into hers.\"  Then the divine one hid himself from the gods, and the  throne in the Boat of Millions of Years[FN#72] was empty.  And it came  to pass that when it was the time for the heart to come forth [from the  god], she said unto her son Horus, \"The great god shall bind himself by  an oath to give his two eyes.\"[FN#73]  Thus was the great god made to  yield up his name, and Isis, the great lady of enchantments, said,  \"Flow on, poison, and come forth from Ra; let the Eye of Horus come  forth from the god and shine(?) outside his mouth.  I have worked, and  I make the poison to fall on the ground, for the venom hath been  mastered.  Verily the name hath been taken away from the great god.  Let Ra live, and let the poison die; and if the poison live then Ra  shall die.  And similarly, a certain man, the son of a certain man,  shall live and the poison shall die.\"  These were the words which spake  Isis, the great lady, the mistress of the gods, and she had knowledge  of Ra in his own name.  The above words shall be said over an image of  Temu and an image of Heru-Hekennu,[FN#74] and over an image of Isis and  an image of Horus.
