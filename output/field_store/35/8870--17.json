When there was no more boy,  and the Captain still alive, Dick, who was a huge strong man like poor old  Bill, said that it was Jakes' turn, and he was very lucky to have lived as  long as he had. But poor old Bill talked it all over with Jakes, and they  thought it better than Dick should take his turn.    \"Then there was Jakes and poor old Bill; and Captain would not die.    \"And these two used to watch one another night and day, when Dick was gone  and no one else was left to them. And at last poor old Bill fell down in a  faint and lay there for an hour. Then Jakes came up to him slowly with his  knife, and makes a stab at poor old Bill as he lies there on the deck. And  poor old Bill caught hold of him by the wrist, and put his knife into him  twice to make quite sure, although it spoiled the best part of the meat.  Then poor old Bill was all alone at sea.    \"And the very next week, before the food gave out, Captain must have died  on his bit of an island; for poor old Bill heard the Captain's soul going  cursing over the sea, and the day after that the ship was cast on a rocky  coast.    \"And Captain's been dead now for over a hundred years, and poor old Bill  is safe ashore again. But it looks as if Captain hadn't done with him yet,  for poor old Bill doesn't ever get any older, and somehow or other he  doesn't seem to die. Poor old Bill!\"    When this was over the man's fascination suddenly snapped, and we all  jumped up and left him.    It was not only his revolting story, but it was the fearful look in the  eyes of the man who told it, and the terrible ease with which his voice  surpassed the roar of the rain, that decided me never again to enter that  haunt of sailors--the tavern of the sea.          THE BEGGARS      I was walking down Piccadilly not long ago, thinking of nursery rhymes and  regretting old romance.    As I saw the shopkeepers walk by in their black frock-coats and their  black hats, I thought of the old line in nursery annals: \"The merchants of  London, they wear scarlet.\"    The streets were all so unromantic, dreary. Nothing could be done for  them, I thought--nothing. And then my thoughts were interrupted by barking  dogs. Every dog in the street seemed to be barking--every kind of dog, not  only the little ones but the big ones too. They were all facing East  towards the way I was coming by. Then I turned round to look and had this  vision, in Piccadilly, on the opposite side to the houses just after you  pass the cab-rank.    Tall bent men were coming down the street arrayed in marvelous cloaks. All  were sallow of skin and swarthy of hair, and most of them wore strange  beards. They were coming slowly, and they walked with staves, and their  hands were out for alms.    All the beggars had come to town.    I would have given them a gold doubloon engraven with the towers of  Castile, but I had no such coin. They did not seem the people to who it  were fitting to offer the same coin as one tendered for the use of a  taxicab (O marvelous, ill-made word, surely the pass-word somewhere of  some evil order). Some of them wore purple cloaks with wide green borders,  and the border of green was a narrow strip with some, and some wore cloaks  of old and faded red, and some wore violet cloaks, and none wore black.  And they begged gracefully, as gods might beg for souls.    I stood by a lamp-post, and they came up to it, and one addressed it,  calling the lamp-post brother, and said, \"O lamp-post, our brother of the  dark, are there many wrecks by thee in the tides of night? Sleep not,  brother, sleep not. There were many wrecks an it were not for thee.\"    It was strange: I had not thought of the majesty of the street lamp and  his long watching over drifting men. But he was not beneath the notice of  these cloaked strangers.    And then one murmured to the street: \"Art thou weary, street? Yet a little  longer they shall go up and down, and keep thee clad with tar and wooden  bricks. Be patient, street. In a while the earthquake cometh.\"    \"Who are you?\" people said. \"And where do you come from?\"    \"Who may tell what we are,\" they answered, \"or whence we come?\"    And one turned towards the smoke-stained houses, saying, \"Blessed be the  houses, because men dream therein.\"    Then I perceived, what I had never thought, that all these staring houses  were not alike, but different one from another, because they held  different dreams.    And another turned to a tree that stood by the Green Park railings,  saying, \"Take comfort, tree, for the fields shall come again.\"    And all the while the ugly smoke went upwards, the smoke that has stifled  Romance and blackened the birds. This, I thought, they can neither praise  nor bless. And when they saw it they raised their hands towards it,  towards the thousand chimneys, saying, \"Behold the smoke. The old  coal-forests that have lain so long in the dark, and so long still, are  dancing now and going back to the sun. Forget not Earth, O our brother,  and we wish thee joy of the sun.\"    It had rained, and a cheerless stream dropped down a dirty gutter. It had  come from heaps of refuse, foul and forgotten; it had gathered upon its  way things that were derelict, and went to somber drains unknown to man or  the sun. It was this sullen stream as much as all other causes that had  made me say in my heart that the town was vile, that Beauty was dead in  it, and Romance fled.    Even this thing they blessed. And one that wore a purple cloak with broad  green border, said, \"Brother, be hopeful yet, for thou shalt surely come  at last to the delectable Sea, and meet the heaving, huge, and travelled  ships, and rejoice by isles that know the golden sun.\" Even thus they  blessed the gutter, and I felt no whim to mock.    And the people that went by, in their black unseemly coats and their  misshapen, monstrous, shiny hats, the beggars also blessed. And one of  them said to one of these dark citizens: \"O twin of Night himself, with  thy specks of white at wrist and neck like to Night's scattered stars. How  fearfully thou dost veil with black thy hid, unguessed desires. They are  deep thoughts in thee that they will not frolic with colour, that they say  'No' to purple, and to lovely green 'Begone.' Thou hast wild fancies that  they must needs be tamed with black, and terrible imaginings that they  must be hidden thus. Has thy soul dreams of the angels, and of the walls  of faery that thou hast guarded it so utterly, lest it dazzle astonished  eyes? Even so God hid the diamond deep down in miles of clay.    \"The wonder of thee is not marred by mirth.    \"Behold thou art very secret.    \"Be wonderful. Be full of mystery.\"    Silently the man in the black frock-coat passed on. And I came to  understand when the purple beggar had spoken, that the dark citizen had  trafficked perhaps with Ind, that in his heart were strange and dumb  ambitions; that his dumbness was founded by solemn rite on the roots of  ancient tradition; that it might be overcome one day by a cheer in the  street or by some one singing a song, and that when this shopman spoke  there might come clefts in the world and people peering over at the abyss.    Then turning towards Green Park, where as yet Spring was not, the beggars  stretched out their hands, and looking at the frozen grass and the yet  unbudding trees they, chanting all together, prophesied daffodils.    A motor omnibus came down the street, nearly running over some of the dogs  that were barking ferociously still. It was sounding its horn noisily.    And the vision went then.          _In a letter from a friend whom I have never seen, one of those that read  my books, this line was quoted--\"But he, he never came to Carcassonne.\" I  do not know the origin of the line, but I made this tale about it._      CARCASSONNE      When Camorak reigned at Arn, and the world was fairer, he gave a festival  to all the weald to commemorate the splendour of his youth.    They say that his house at Arn was huge and high, and its ceiling painted  blue; and when evening fell men would climb up by ladders and light the  scores of candles hanging from slender chains. And they say, too, that  sometimes a cloud would come, and pour in through the top of one of the  oriel windows, and it would come over the edge of the stonework as the  sea-mist comes over a sheer cliffs shaven lip where an old wind has blown  for ever and ever (he has swept away thousands of leaves and thousands of  centuries, they are all one to him, he owes no allegiance to Time). And  the cloud would re-shape itself in the hall's lofty vault and drift on  through it slowly, and out to the sky again through another window. And  from its shape the knights in Camorak's hall would prophesy the battles  and sieges of the next season of war. They say of the hall of Camorak at  Arn that there hath been none like it in any land, and foretell that there  will be never.    Hither had come in the folk of the Weald from sheepfold and from forest,  revolving slow thoughts of food, and shelter, and love, and they sat down  wondering in that famous hall; and therein also were seated the men of  Arn, the town that clustered round the King's high house, and all was  roofed with red, maternal earth.    If old songs may be trusted, it was a marvelous hall.    Many who sat there could only have seen it distantly before, a clear shape  in the landscape, but smaller than a hill. Now they beheld along the wall  the weapons of Camorak's men, of which already the lute-players made  songs, and tales were told at evening in the byres. There they described  the shield of Camorak that had gone to and fro across so many battles, and  the sharp but dinted edges of his sword; there were the weapons of Gadriol  the Leal, and Norn, and Athoric of the Sleety Sword, Heriel the Wild,  Yarold, and Thanga of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#15)"],[1,"1895.]    [Footnote 24: One of the authors of \"Junker Schmidt.\"]    [Footnote 25: The curious may be disposed to trace to some such  \"corrections beforehand\" the remarkable discrepancy of style and matter  which distinguishes some of Tolstoy's later works, published after his  death by Mr. Tchertkof and his literary executors.]    [Footnote 26: Tolstoy's private secretary, arrested and banished in  1908.]    [Footnote 27: Five weeks after Leskof's death.]    [Footnote 28: The Countess Tolstoy.]"]]]
