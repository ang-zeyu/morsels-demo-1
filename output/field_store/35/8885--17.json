It means literally,  \"the name-carriers,\"--as if, said one of my informants, they bore a  parcel of names in a bag slung upon the back.    Each of the other nations had also its peculiar name in the Council,  distinct from the mere local designation by which it was commonly  called. Thus the Caniengas had for their \"Council name\" the term  _Tehadirihoken_. This is the plural form of the name of their leading  chief, Tekarihoken. Opinions differ much among the Indians as to the  meaning of this name. Cusick, the Tuscarora historian, defines it \"a  speech divided,\" and apparently refers it to the division of the  Iroquois language into dialects. Chief George Johnson, the interpreter,  rendered it \"two statements together,\" or \"two pieces of news together.\"  Another native informant thought it meant \"one word in two divisions,\"  while a third defined it as meaning \"between two words.\" The root-word  of the name is the Canienga _orihwa_, or _karihwa_, (properly  _karihoa_), which is defined \"thing, affair, speech, news.\" [Footnote:  See Bruyas, _sub voce Gorihoa_. Mr. Morgan (_League of the Iroquois_, p.  97), who derived his information from the Senecas, says that the name  \"was a term of respect, and signifies 'neutral,' or, as it may be  rendered, the shield.\" He adds, \"its origin is lost in obscurity.\"] It  also apparently means office; thus we have the derivatives _garihont_,  \"to give some charge of duty to some one,\" and _atrihont_, \"to be an  officer, or captain.\" The name is in the peculiar dual or rather  duplicative form which is indicated by the prefix _te_ and the affix  _ken_ or _ke_. It may possibly, therefore, mean \"holding two offices,\"  and would thus be specially applicable to the great Canienga noble, who,  unlike most of his order, was both a civil ruler and a war-chief. But  whether he gave his name to his people, or received it from them, is  uncertain. In other instances the Council name of a nation appears to  have been applied in the singular number to the leading chief of the  nation. Thus the head-chief of the Onondagas was often known by the  title of _Sakosennakehte_, \"the Name-carrier.\" [Footnote: \"Il y avait en  cette bande un Capitaine qui porte'le nom le plus considerable de toute  sa Nation, Sagochiendagehte.\"--_Relation_ of 1654, p. 8. Elsewhere, as  in the _Relation_ for 1657, p. 17, this name is spelt Agochiendaguete.]    The name of the Oneida nation in the Council was _Nihatirontakowa_--or,  in the Onondaga dialect, _Nihatientakona_--usually rendered the  \"Great-Tree People,\"--literally, \"those of the great log.\" It is derived  from _karonta_, a fallen tree or piece of timber, with the suffix _kowa_  or _kona_, great, added, and the verb-forming pronoun prefixed. In the  singular number it becomes _Niharontakowa_, which would be understood to  mean \"He is an Oneida.\" The name, it is said, was given to the nation  because when Dekanawidah and Hiawatha first went to meet its chief, they  crossed the Oneida creek on a bridge composed of an immense tree which  had fallen or been laid across it, and noted that the Council fire at  which the treaty was concluded was kindled against another huge log.  These, however, may be merely explanations invented in later times.    The Cayugas bore in Council the name of _Sotinonnawentona_, meaning \"the  Great-Pipe People.\" In the singular it is _Sononnawentona_. The root of  the word is _kanonnawen_, which in composition becomes _kanonnawenta_,  meaning pipe, or calumet. It is said that the chief who in the first  Council represented the Cayugas smoked a pipe of unusual size, which  attracted the notice of the \"name-givers.\"    Finally the Seneca mountaineers, the _Sonnontowanas_, bore the title, in  the Canienga speech, of _Ronaninhohonti_, \"the Door-keepers,\" or  literally, \"they who are at the doorway.\" In the singular this becomes  _Roninhohonti_. In the Onondaga dialect it is _Honinhohonta_. It is a  verbal form, derived from _Kanhoha_, door, and _ont_, to be. This name  is undoubtedly coeval with the formation of the League, and was bestowed  as a title of honor. The Senecas, at the western end of the \"extended  mansion,\" guarded the entrance against the wild tribes in that quarter,  whose hostility was most to be dreaded.    The enumeration of the chiefs who formed the confederacy is closed by  the significant words, \"and then, in later times, additions were made to  the great edifice.\" This is sufficient evidence that the Canienga \"Book  of Rites\" was composed in its present form after the Tuscaroras, and  possibly after the Nanticokes and Tuteloes, were received into the  League. The Tuscaroras were admitted in 1714; the two other nations were  received about the year 1753. [Footnote: The former date is well known;  for the latter, see _N. Y. Hist. Col._, Vol. 6, p. 311; Stone's _Life of  Sir William Johnson_, p. 434.]    An outburst of lamentation follows. The speaker has recited the names of  the heroes and statesmen to whom the united nations were indebted for  the Great Peace which had so long prevailed among them. He has recalled  the wise laws which they established; and he is about to chant the  closing litany, commemorating the fifty chiefs who composed the first  federal council, and whose names have remained as the official titles of  their successors. In recalling these memories of departed greatness his  mind is filled with grief and humiliation at the contrast presented by  the degeneracy of his own days. It is a common complaint of all  countries and all times; but the sentiment was always, according to the  missionaries, especially strong among the Indians, who are a  conservative race. The orator appeals to the shades of their ancestors,  in words which, in the baldest of literal versions, are full of  eloquence and pathos. The \"great law\" has become old, and has lost its  force. Its authors have passed away, and have carried it with them into  their graves. They have placed it as a pillow under their heads. Their  degenerate successors have inherited their names, but not their mighty  intellects; and in the flourishing region which they left, naught but a  desert remains. A trace, and not a slight one, of the mournful sublimity  which we admire in the Hebrew prophets, with a similar cadence of  \"parallelism\" in the style, will be noticed in this forest lament.    The same characteristics mark the chanted litany which closes the  address. There is not merely parallelism and cadence, but occasionally  rhyme, in the stanzas which are interspersed among the names, as is seen  in the oft-repeated chorus which follows the names composing each clan  or \"class\":--        Etho natejonhne,    Sewaterihwakhaonghkwe,    Sewarihwisaanonghkwe,      Kayaterenhkowa. [Footnote: For the translation, see _ante_, p. 33.]    This litany is sung in the usual style of their mourning or religious  chants, with many long-drawn repetitions of the customary ejaculation  _haihhaih_,--an exclamation which, like the Greek \"ai! ai!\" belongs to  the wailing style appropriate to such a monody. The expressions of the  chant, like those of a Greek chorus, are abrupt, elliptical, and  occasionally obscure. It is probable that this chant, like the condoling  Hymn in the former part of the Book, is of earlier style than the other  portions of the work, their rhythmical form having preserved the  original words with greater accuracy. Such explanations of the doubtful  passages as could be obtained from the chiefs and the interpreters will  be found in the notes.    The chant and the Book end abruptly with the mournful exclamation, \"Now  we are dejected in mind.\" The lament which precedes the litany, and  which is interrupted by it, may be said to close with these words. As  the council is held, nominally at least, for the purpose of condolence,  and as it necessarily revives the memory of the departed worthies of  their republic, it is natural that the ceremonies throughout should be  of a melancholy cast. They were doubtless so from the beginning, and  before there was any occasion to deplore the decay of their commonwealth  or the degeneracy of the age. In fact, when we consider that the  founders of the League, with remarkable skill and judgment, managed to  compress into a single day the protracted and wasteful obsequies  customary among other tribes of the same race, we shall not be surprised  to find that they sought to make the ceremonies of the day as solemn and  impressive as possible.    But there are other characteristics of the \"Book of Rites,\" prominent in  the Canienga section, and still more marked in the Onondaga portion,  which may well excite our astonishment. They have been already noticed,  but seem to deserve fuller consideration. It will be observed that, from  beginning to end, the Book breathes nothing but sentiments of kindness  and sympathy for the living, and of reverence for the departed,--not  merely for the chief whom they have come to mourn, but also for the  great men who have preceded him, and especially for the founders of  their commonwealth. Combined with these sentiments, and harmonizing with  them, is an earnest desire for peace, along with a profound respect for  the laws under which they lived. The work in which these feelings are  expressed is a genuine composition of the Indians themselves, framed  long before they were affected by any influences from abroad, and  repeated among them for centuries, with the entire assent of the  hearers. It affords unquestionable evidence of the true character both  of those who composed and of those who received it.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE IROQUOIS CHARACTER.      The popular opinion of the Indian, and more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#15)"],[1," a celebrated philosopher of this city, who applied himself all  his life to the knowledge of plants and minerals, and at last  performed such surprising cures in this city as will never be  forgotten; but he died suddenly himself, before he could apply his  own sovereign remedy, and left his wife and a great many young  children behind him in very indifferent circumstances; to support  her family, and provide for her children, she has resolved to sell  it.'    While the crier was telling Prince Ahmed the virtues of the  artificial apple, a great many persons came about them, and  confirmed what he said; and one among the rest said he had a friend  dangerously ill, whose life was despaired of, which was a  favourable opportunity to show Prince Ahmed the experiment. Upon  which Prince Ahmed told the crier he would give him forty purses if  he cured the sick person by letting him smell at it.    The crier, who had orders to sell it at that price, said to Prince  Ahmed, 'Come, sir, let us go and make the experiment, and the apple  shall be yours; it is an undoubted fact that it will always have  the same effect as it already has had in recovering from death many  sick persons whose life was despaired of.'    The experiment succeeded, and the prince, after he had counted out  to the crier forty purses, and the other had delivered the apple to  him, waited with the greatest impatience for the first caravan that  should return to the Indies. In the meantime he saw all that was  curious in and about Samarcand, especially the valley of Sogda, so  called from the river which waters it, and is reckoned by the  Arabians to be one of the four paradises of this world, for the  beauty of its fields and gardens and fine palaces, and for its  fertility in fruit of all sorts, and all the other pleasures  enjoyed there in the fine season.    At last Prince Ahmed joined the first caravan that returned to the  Indies, and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the Princes  Houssain and Ali were waiting for him.    Prince Ali, who was there some time before Prince Ahmed, asked  Prince Houssain, who got there first, how long he had been there;  he told him three months: to which he replied, 'Then certainly you  have not been very far.'    'I will tell you nothing now,' said Prince Houssain, 'but only  assure you I was more than three months travelling to the place I  went to.'    'But then,' replied Prince Ali, 'you made a short stay there.'    'Indeed, brother,' said Prince Houssain, 'you are mistaken: I  resided at one place over four or five months, and might have  stayed longer.'    'Unless you flew back,' replied Prince Ali again, 'I cannot  comprehend how you can have been three months here, as you would  make me believe.'    'I tell you the truth,' added Prince Houssain, 'and it is a riddle  which I shall not explain till our brother Ahmed comes; then I will  let you know what curiosity I have brought home from my travels. I  know not what you have got, but believe it to be some trifle,  because I do not see that your baggage is increased.'    'And pray what have you brought?' replied Prince Ali, 'for I can  see nothing but an ordinary piece of carpet, with which you cover  your sofa, and as you seem to make what you have brought a secret,  you cannot take it amiss that I do the same.'    'I consider the rarity which I have purchased,' replied Prince  Houssain, 'to excel all others whatever, and should not have any  objection to show it you, and make you agree that it is so, and at  the same time tell you how I came by it, without being in the least  apprehensive that what you have got is better. But we ought to wait  till our brother Ahmed arrives, that we may all communicate our  good fortune to each other.'    Prince Ali would not enter into a dispute with Prince Houssain, but  was persuaded that, if his perspective glass were not preferable,  it was impossible it should be inferior, and therefore agreed to  wait till Prince Ahmed arrived, to produce his purchase.    When Prince Ahmed came, they embraced and complimented each other  on the happiness of meeting together at the place they set out  from. Then Prince Houssain, as the elder brother, said, 'Brothers,  we shall have time enough hereafter to entertain ourselves with the  particulars of our travels: let us come to that which is of the  greatest importance for us to know; let us not conceal from each  other the curiosities we have brought home, but show them, that we  may do ourselves justice beforehand and see to which of us the  sultan our father may give the preference.    'To set the example,' continued Prince Houssain, 'I will tell you  that the rarity which I have brought from my travels to the kingdom  of Bisnagar, is the carpet on which I sit, which looks but ordinary  and makes no show; but, when I have declared its virtues to you,  you will be struck with admiration, and will confess you never  heard of anything like it. Whoever sits on it as we do, and desires  to be transported to any place, be it ever so far off, is  immediately carried thither. I made the experiment myself before I  paid down the forty purses, and when I had fully satisfied my  curiosity at the court of Bisnagar, and had a mind to return, I  made use of no other means than this wonderful carpet for myself  and servant, who can tell you how long we were coming hither. I  will show you both the experiment whenever you please. I expect you  to tell me whether what you have brought is to be compared to this  carpet.'    Here Prince Houssain ended, and Prince Ali said, 'I must own,  brother, that your carpet is one of the most surprising things  imaginable, if it has, as I do not doubt in the least, that  property you speak of. But you must allow that there may be other  things, I will not say more, but at least as wonderful, in another  way; and to convince you there are, here is an ivory tube, which  appears to the eye no more a rarity than your carpet. It cost me as  much, and I am as well satisfied with my purchase as you can be  with yours; and you will be so just as to own that I have not been  cheated, when you know by experience that by looking at one end you  see whatever you wish to behold. Take it,' added Prince Ali,  presenting the tube to him, 'make trial of it yourself.'    Prince Houssain took the ivory tube from Prince Ali, and clapped  that end to his eye which Prince Ali showed him, to see the  Princess Nouronnihar, and to know how she was, when Prince Ali and  Prince Ahmed, who kept their eyes fixed upon him, were extremely  surprised to see his countenance change suddenly with extraordinary  pain and grief. Prince Houssain would not give them time to ask  what was the matter, but cried out, 'Alas! princes, to what purpose  have we undertaken long and fatiguing journeys? In a few moments  our lovely princess will breathe her last. I saw her in her bed,  surrounded by her women and attendants, who were all in tears. Take  the tube, behold for yourselves the miserable state she is in.'    Prince Ali took the tube out of Prince Houssain's hand and after he  had looked, presented it to Prince Ahmed.    When Prince Ahmed saw that the Princess Nouronnihar's end was so  near, he addressed himself to his two brothers, and said, 'Princes,  the Princess Nouronnihar, the object of all our vows, is indeed at  death's door; but provided we make haste and lose no time, we may  preserve her life.' Then he took out the artificial apple, and  showing it to the princes his brothers, said to them, 'This apple  which you see here cost as much as either the carpet or tube. The  opportunity now presents itself to show you its wonderful virtue.  Not to keep you longer in suspense, if a sick person smells it,  though in the last agonies, it restores him to perfect health  immediately. I have made the experiment, and can show you its  wonderful effect on the Princess Nouronnihar, if we make all haste  to assist her.'    'If that is all,' replied Prince Houssain, 'we cannot make more  haste than by transporting ourselves instantly into her room by the  means of my carpet. Come, lose no time; sit down on it by me; it is  large enough to hold us all three: but first let us give orders to  our servants to set out immediately, and join us at the palace.'    As soon as the order was given, Prince Ali and Prince Ahmed went  and sat down by Prince Houssain, and all three framed the same  wish, and were transported into the Princess Nouronnihar's chamber.    The presence of the three princes, who were so little expected,  frightened the princess's women and attendants, who could not  comprehend by what enchantment three men should be among them; for  they did not know them at first, and the attendants were ready to  fall upon them, as people who had got into a part of the palace  where they were not allowed to come; but they presently recollected  and found their mistake.    Prince Ahmed no sooner saw himself in Nouronnihar's room, and  perceived the princess dying, than he rose off the tapestry, as did  also the other two princes, and went to the bed-side, and put the  apple under her nose. Some moments after, the princess opened her  eyes, and turned her head from one side to another, looking at the  persons who stood about her; she then rose up in the bed, and asked  to be dressed, just as if she had awaked out of a sound sleep. Her  women informed her, in a manner that showed their joy, that she was  obliged to the three princes her cousins, and particularly to  Prince Ahmed, for the sudden recovery of her health. She  immediately expressed her joy to see them, and thanked them all  together, and afterwards Prince Ahmed in particular, and they then  retired.    While the princess was dressing, the princes went to throw  themselves at the sultan their father's feet, and pay their  respects to him. The sultan received and embraced them with the  greatest joy, both for their return and for the"]]]
