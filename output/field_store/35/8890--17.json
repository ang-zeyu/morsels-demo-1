The occurrence had been sufficient to give a new direction to Milton's  thoughts. Regardless of the fact that his plea for liberty in marriage  had fallen upon deaf ears, he would plead for liberty of speech. The  _Areopagitica, for the Liberty of unlicensed Printing_, came out in  November, 1644, an unlicensed, unregistered publication, without  printer's or bookseller's name. It was cast in the form of a speech  addressed to the Parliament. The motto was taken from Euripides, and  printed in the original Greek, which was not, when addressed to the  Parliament of 1644, the absurdity which it would be now. The title is  less appropriate, being borrowed from the _Areopagitic Discourse_ of  Isocrates, between which and Milton's _Speech_ there is no resemblance  either in subject or style. All that the two productions have in  common is their form. They are both unspoken orations, written to the  address of a representative assembly--the one to the Boul√© or Senate  of Athens, the other to the Parliament of England.    Milton's _Speech_ is in his own best style; a copious flood of  majestic eloquence, the outpouring of a noble soul with a divine  scorn of narrow dogma and paltry aims. But it is a mere pamphlet,  extemporised in, at most, a month or two, without research or special  knowledge, with no attempt to ascertain general principles, and more  than Milton's usual disregard of method. A jurist's question, is here  handled by a rhetorician. He has preached a noble and heart-stirring  sermon on his text, but the problem for the legislator remains where  it was. The vagueness and confusion of the thoughts finds a vehicle  in language which is too often overcrowded and obscure. I think the  _Areopagitica_ has few or no offences against taste; on the other  hand, it has few or none of those grand passages which redeem the  scurrility of his political pamphlets. The passage in which Milton's  visit to Galileo \"grown old, a prisoner to the Inquisition,\" is  mentioned, is often quoted for its biographical interest; and the  terse dictum, \"as good almost kill a man as kill a good book,\" has  passed into a current axiom. A paragraph at the close, where he hints  that the time may be come to suppress the suppressors, intimates, but  so obscurely as to be likely to escape notice, that Milton had already  made up his mind that a struggle with the Presbyterian party was to be  the sequel of the overthrow of the Royalists. He has not yet arrived  at the point he will hereafter reach, of rejecting the very idea of  a minister of religion, but he is already aggrieved by the implicit  faith which the Puritan laity, who had cast out bishops, were  beginning to bestow upon their pastor; \"a factor to whose care and  credit he may commit the whole managing of his religious affairs.\"  Finally, it must be noted, that Milton, though he had come to see  round Presbyterianism, had not, in 1644, shaken off all dogmatic  profession. His toleration of opinion was far from complete. He  would call in the intervention of the executioner in the case of  \"mischievous and libellous books,\" and could not bring himself to  contemplate the toleration of Popery and open superstition, \"which as  it extirpates all religious and civil supremacies, so itself should be  extirpate; provided first that all charitable and compassionate means  be used to win and gain the weak and misled.\"    The _Areopagitica_, as might be expected, produced no effect upon the  legislation of the Long Parliament, of whom (says Hallam) \"very  few acts of political wisdom or courage are recorded.\" Individual  licensers became more lax in the performance of the duty, but this is  reasonably to be ascribed to the growing spirit of independency--a  spirit which was incompatible with any embargo on the utterance of  private opinion. A curious epilogue to the history of this publication  is the fact, first brought to light by Mr. Masson, that the author of  the _Areopagitica_, at a later time, acted himself in the capacity of  licenser. It was in 1651, under the Commonwealth, Marchmont Needham  being editor of the weekly paper called _Mercurius Politicus_, that  Milton was associated with him as his censor or supervising editor.  Mr. Masson conjectures, with some probability, that the leading  articles of the _Mercurius_, during part of the year 1651, received  touches from Milton's hand. But this was, after all, rather in the  character of editor, whose business it is to see that nothing improper  goes into the paper, than in that of press licenser in the sense in  which the _Areopagitica_ had denounced it.          CHAPTER VII.    BIOGRAPHICAL. 1640--1649.      In September, 1645, Milton left the garden-house in Aldersgate, for  a larger house in Barbican, in the same neighbourhood, but a little  further from the city gate, i.e. more in the country. The larger house  was, perhaps, required for the accommodation of his pupils (see above,  p. 44), but it served to shelter his wife's family, when they were  thrown upon the world by the surrender of Oxford in June, 1646. In  this Barbican house Mr. Powell died at the end of that year. Milton  had been promised with his wife a portion of 1000 l.; but Mr. Powell's  affairs had long been in a very embarrassed condition, and now by the  consequences of delinquency that condition had become one of absolute  ruin. Great pains have been bestowed by Mr. Masson in unravelling the  entanglement of the Powell accounts. The data which remain are ample,  and we cannot but feel astonished at the accuracy with which our  national records, in more important matters so defective, enable us  to set out a debtor and creditor balance of the estate of a private  citizen, who died more than 200 years ago. But the circumstances  are peculiarly intricate, and we are still unable to reconcile Mr,  Powell's will with the composition records, both of which are extant.  As a compounding delinquent, his fine, assessed at the customary rate  of two years' income, was fixed by the commissioners at 180 l. The  commissioners must have, therefore, been satisfied that his income did  not exceed 90 l. a year. Yet by his will of date December 30, 1646, he  leaves his estate of Forest Hill, the annual value of which alone far  exceeded 90 l., to his eldest son. This property is not mentioned  in the inventory of his estate, real and personal, laid before the  commissioners, sworn to by the delinquent, and by them accepted. The  possible explanation is that the Forest Hill property had really  passed into the possession, by foreclosure, of the mortgagee, Sir  Robert Pye, who sate for Woodstock in the Long Parliament, but that  Mr. Powell, making his will on his deathbed, pleased himself with the  fancy of leaving his son and heir an estate which was no longer his to  dispose of. Putting Forest Hill out of the account, it would appear  that the sequestrators had dealt somewhat harshly with Mr. Powell; for  they had included in their estimate one doubtful asset of 500 l., and  one non-existent of 400 l. This last item was a stock of timber stated  to be at Forest Hill, but which had really been appropriated without  payment by the Parliamentarians, and part of it voted by Parliament  itself towards repair of the church in the staunch Puritan town of  Banbury.    The upshot of the whole transaction is that, in satisfaction of his  claim of 1500 l. (1000 l. his wife's dower, 500 l. an old loan of  1627), Milton came into possession of some property at Wheatley. This  property, consisting of the tithes of Wheatley, certain cottages,  and three and a half yard lands, had in the time of the disturbances  produced only 40 l. a year. But as the value of all property improved  when, the civil war came to an end, Milton found the whole could now  be let for 80 l. But then out of this he had to pay Mr. Powell's  composition, reduced to 130 l. on Milton's petition, and the widow's  jointure, computed at 26 l. 13 s. 4 d. per annum. What of income  remained after these disbursements he might apply towards repaying  himself the old loan of 1627. This was all Milton ever saw of the 1000  l. which Mr. Powell, with the high-flying magnificence of a cavalier  who knew he was ruined, had promised as his daughter's portion.    Mr. Powell's death was followed in less than three months by that of  John Milton, senior. He died in the house in Barbican, and the entry,  \"John Milton, gentleman, 15 (March),\" among the burials in 1646,  is still to be seen in the register of the parish of St. Giles's,  Cripplegate. A host of eminent men have traced the first impulse of  their genius to their mother. Milton always acknowledged with just  gratitude that it was to his father's discerning taste and fostering  care, that he owed the encouragement of his studies, and the leisure  which rendered them possible. He has registered this gratitude in both  prose and verse. The Latin hexameters, \"Ad patrem,\" written at Horton,  are inspired by a feeling far beyond commonplace filial piety, and a  warmth which is rare indeed in neo-Latin versification. And when, in  his prose pamphlets, he has occasion to speak of himself, he does not  omit the acknowledgment of \"the ceaseless diligence and care of my  father, whom God recompense.\" (_Reason of Church Government_.)    After the death of his father, being now more at ease in his  circumstances, he gave up taking pupils, and quitted the large house  in Barbican for a smaller in High Holborn, opening backwards into  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. This removal was about Michaelmas, 1647.    During this period, 1639--1649, while his interests were engaged by  the all-absorbing events of the civil strife, he wrote no poetry,  or none deserving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#15)"],[1,"y,\" said Jurgen, \"everywhere. For thus is every  woman for a little while, and thus is every man for all time.\"    \"That being a dreadful truth,\" continued Gogyrvan, \"you may take it  as one of the many reasons why I jeer out of season in order to  stave off far more untimely tears. For this thing happens: in my  city it happens, and in my castle it happens. King or no, I am  powerless to prevent its happening. So I can but shrug and hearten  my old blood with a fresh bottle. No less, I regard the young woman,  who is quite possibly my daughter, with considerable affection: and  it would be salutary for you to remember that circumstance, Messire  de Logreus, if ever you are tempted to be candid.\"    Jurgen was horrified. \"But with the Princess, sir, it is unthinkable  that I should not deal fairly.\"    King Gogyrvan continued to look at Jurgen. Gogyrvan Gawr said  nothing, and not a muscle of him moved.    \"Although of course,\" said Jurgen, \"I would, in simple justice to  her, not ever consider volunteering any information likely to cause  pain.\"    \"Again I perceive,\" said Gogyrvan, \"that you understand me. Yet I  did not speak of my daughter only, but of everybody.\"    \"How then, sir, would you have me deal with everybody?\"    \"Why, I can but repeat my words,\" says Gogyrvan, very patiently: \"I  would have you lie like a gentleman. And now be off with you, for I  am going to sleep. I shall not be wide awake again until my daughter  is safely married. And that is absolutely all I can do for you.\"    \"Do you think this is reputable conduct, King?\"    \"Oh, no!\" says Gogyrvan, surprised. \"It is what we call  philanthropy.\"          14.    Preliminary Tactics of Duke Jurgen      So Jurgen abode at court, and was tolerably content for a little  while. He loved a princess, the fairest and most perfect of mortal  women; and loved her (a circumstance to which he frequently  recurred) as never any other man had loved in the world's history:  and very shortly he was to stand by and see her married to another.  Here was a situation to delight the chivalrous court of Glathion,  for every requirement of romance was exactly fulfilled.    Now the appearance of Guenevere, whom Jurgen loved with an entire  heart, was this:--She was of middling height, with a figure not yet  wholly the figure of a woman. She had fine and very thick hair, and  the color of it was the yellow of corn floss. When Guenevere undid  her hair it was a marvel to Jurgen to note how snugly this hair  descended about the small head and slender throat, and then  broadened boldly and clothed her with a loose soft foam of pallid  gold. For Jurgen delighted in her hair; and with increasing  intimacy, loved to draw great strands of it back of his head,  crossing them there, and pressing soft handfuls of her perfumed hair  against his cheeks as he kissed the Princess.    The head of Guenevere, be it repeated, was small: you wondered at  the proud free tossing movements of that little head which had to  sustain the weight of so much hair. The face of Guenevere was  colored tenderly and softly: it made the faces of other women seem  the work of a sign-painter, just splotched in anyhow. Gray eyes had  Guenevere, veiled by incredibly long black lashes that curved  incredibly. Her brows arched rather high above her eyes: that was  almost a fault. Her nose was delicate and saucy: her chin was  impudence made flesh: and her mouth was a tiny and irresistible  temptation.    \"And so on, and so on! But indeed there is no sense at all in  describing this lovely girl as though I were taking an inventory of  my shopwindow,\" said Jurgen. \"Analogues are all very well, and they  have the unanswerable sanction of custom: none the less, when I  proclaim that my adored mistress's hair reminds me of gold I am  quite consciously lying. It looks like yellow hair, and nothing  else: nor would I willingly venture within ten feet of any woman  whose head sprouted with wires, of whatever metal. And to protest  that her eyes are as gray and fathomless as the sea is very well  also, and the sort of thing which seems expected of me: but imagine  how horrific would be puddles of water slopping about in a lady's  eye-sockets! If we poets could actually behold the monsters we rhyme  of, we would scream and run. Still, I rather like this sirvente.\"    For he was making a sirvente in praise of Guenevere. It was the  pleasant custom of Gogyrvan's court that every gentleman must  compose verses in honor of the lady of whom he was hopelessly  enamored; as well as that in these verses he should address the lady  (as one whose name was too sacred to mention) otherwise than did her  sponsors. So Duke Jurgen of Logreus duly rhapsodized of his  Phyllida.    \"I borrow for my dear love the appellation of that noted but by much  inferior lady who was beloved by Ariphus of Belsize,\" he explained.  \"You will remember Poliger suspects she was a princess of the house of  Scleroveus: and you of course recall Pisander's masterly summing-up of  the probabilities, in his _Heraclea_.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" they said. And the courtiers of Gogyrvan Gawr, like  Mother Sereda, were greatly impressed by young Duke Jurgen's  erudition.    For Jurgen was Duke of Logreus nowadays, with his glittering shirt  and the coronet upon his bridle to show for it. Awkwardly this  proved to be an earl's coronet, but incongruities are not always  inexplicable.    \"It was Earl Giarmuid's horse. You have doubtless heard of Giarmuid:  but to ask that is insulting.\"    \"Oh, not at all. It is humor. We perfectly understand your humor,  Duke Jurgen.\"    \"And a very pretty fighter I found this famous Giarmuid as I  traveled westward. And since he killed my steed in the heat of our  conversation, I was compelled to take over his horse, after I had  given this poor Giarmuid proper interment. Oh, yes, a very pretty  fighter, and I had heard much talk of him in Logreus. He was Lord of  Ore and Persaunt, you remember, though of course the estate came by  his mother's side.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" they said. \"You must not think that we of Glathion are  quite shut out from the great world. We have heard of all these  affairs. And we have also heard fine things of your duchy of  Logreus, messire.\"    \"Doubtless,\" said Jurgen; and turned again to his singing.    \"Lo, for I pray to thee, resistless Love,\" he descanted, \"that thou  to-day make cry unto my love, to Phyllida whom I, poor Logreus, love  so tenderly, not to deny me love! Asked why, say thou my drink and  food is love, in days wherein I think and brood on love, and truly  find naught good in aught save love, since Phyllida hath taught me  how to love.\"    Here Jurgen groaned with nicely modulated ardor; and he continued:  \"If she avow such constant hate of love as would ignore my great and  constant love, plead thou no more! With listless lore of love woo  Death resistlessly, resistless Love, in place of her that saith such  scorn of love as lends to Death the lure and grace I love.\"    Thus Jurgen sang melodiously of his Phyllida, and meant thereby (as  everybody knew) the Princess Guenevere. Since custom compelled him  to deal in analogues, he dealt wholesale. Gems and metals, the  blossoms of the field and garden, fires and wounds and sunrises and  perfumes, an armory of lethal weapons, ice and a concourse of  mythological deities were his starting-point. Then the seas  and heavens were dredged of phenomena to be mentioned with  disparagement, in comparison with one or another feature of Duke  Jurgen's Phyllida. Zoology and history, and generally the remembered  contents of his pawnshop, were overhauled and made to furnish  targets for depreciation: whereas in dealing with the famous ladies  loved by earlier poets, Duke Jurgen was positively insulting,  allowing hardly a rag of merit. Still, he was careful to be just:  and he allowed that these poor creatures might figure advantageously  enough in eyes which had never beheld his Phyllida. And to all this  information the lady whom he hymned attended willingly.    \"She is a princess,\" reflected Jurgen. \"She is quite beautiful. She  is young, and whatever her father's opinion, she is reasonably  intelligent, as women go. Nobody could ask more. Why, then, am I not  out of my head about her? Already she permits a kiss or two when  nobody is around, and presently she will permit more. And she thinks  I am quite the cleverest person living. Come, Jurgen, man! is there  no heart in this spry young body you have regained? Come, let us  have a little honest rapture and excitement over this promising  situation!\"    But somehow Jurgen could not manage it. He was interested in what,  he knew, was going to happen. Yes, undoubtedly he looked forward to  more intimate converse with this beautiful young princess, but it  was rather as one anticipates partaking of a favorite dessert.  Jurgen felt that a liaison arranged for in this spirit was neither  one thing or the other.    \"If only I could feel like a cold-blooded villain, now, I would at  worst be classifiable. But I intend the girl no harm, I am honestly  fond of her. I shall talk my best, broaden her ideas, and give her,  I flatter myself, considerable pleasure: vulgar prejudices apart, I  shall leave her no whit the worse. Why, the dear little thing, not  for the ransom of seven emperors would I do her any hurt! And in  these matters discretion is everything, simply everything. No, quite  decidedly, I am not a cold-blooded villain; and I shall deal fairly  with the Princess.\"    Thus Jurgen was disappointed by his own emotions, as he turned them  from side to side, and prodded them, and shifted to a fresh  viewpoint, only to find it no more favorable than the one  relinquished: but he veiled the inadequacy of his emotions with very  moving fervors. The tale does not record his conversations with  Guenevere: for Jurgen now discoursed plain idiocy, as one purveys  sweetmeats to a child in fond astonishment at"]]]
