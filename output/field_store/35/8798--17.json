These ancient Martians had been a highly cultivated and literary race,  but during the vicissitudes of those trying centuries of readjustment  to new conditions, not only did their advancement and production cease  entirely, but practically all their archives, records, and literature  were lost.    Dejah Thoris related many interesting facts and legends concerning this  lost race of noble and kindly people.  She said that the city in which  we were camping was supposed to have been a center of commerce and  culture known as Korad.  It had been built upon a beautiful, natural  harbor, landlocked by magnificent hills.  The little valley on the west  front of the city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor,  while the pass through the hills to the old sea bottom had been the  channel through which the shipping passed up to the city's gates.    The shores of the ancient seas were dotted with just such cities, and  lesser ones, in diminishing numbers, were to be found converging toward  the center of the oceans, as the people had found it necessary to  follow the receding waters until necessity had forced upon them their  ultimate salvation, the so-called Martian canals.    We had been so engrossed in exploration of the building and in our  conversation that it was late in the afternoon before we realized it.  We were brought back to a realization of our present conditions by a  messenger bearing a summons from Lorquas Ptomel directing me to appear  before him forthwith.  Bidding Dejah Thoris and Sola farewell, and  commanding Woola to remain on guard, I hastened to the audience  chamber, where I found Lorquas Ptomel and Tars Tarkas seated upon the  rostrum.          CHAPTER XII    A PRISONER WITH POWER      As I entered and saluted, Lorquas Ptomel signaled me to advance, and,  fixing his great, hideous eyes upon me, addressed me thus:    \"You have been with us a few days, yet during that time you have by  your prowess won a high position among us.  Be that as it may, you are  not one of us; you owe us no allegiance.    \"Your position is a peculiar one,\" he continued; \"you are a prisoner  and yet you give commands which must be obeyed; you are an alien and  yet you are a Tharkian chieftain; you are a midget and yet you can kill  a mighty warrior with one blow of your fist.  And now you are reported  to have been plotting to escape with another prisoner of another race;  a prisoner who, from her own admission, half believes you are returned  from the valley of Dor.  Either one of these accusations, if proved,  would be sufficient grounds for your execution, but we are a just  people and you shall have a trial on our return to Thark, if Tal Hajus  so commands.    \"But,\" he continued, in his fierce guttural tones, \"if you run off with  the red girl it is I who shall have to account to Tal Hajus; it is I  who shall have to face Tars Tarkas, and either demonstrate my right to  command, or the metal from my dead carcass will go to a better man, for  such is the custom of the Tharks.    \"I have no quarrel with Tars Tarkas; together we rule supreme the  greatest of the lesser communities among the green men; we do not wish  to fight between ourselves; and so if you were dead, John Carter, I  should be glad.  Under two conditions only, however, may you be killed  by us without orders from Tal Hajus; in personal combat in  self-defense, should you attack one of us, or were you apprehended in  an attempt to escape.    \"As a matter of justice I must warn you that we only await one of these  two excuses for ridding ourselves of so great a responsibility.  The  safe delivery of the red girl to Tal Hajus is of the greatest  importance.  Not in a thousand years have the Tharks made such a  capture; she is the granddaughter of the greatest of the red jeddaks,  who is also our bitterest enemy.  I have spoken.  The red girl told us  that we were without the softer sentiments of humanity, but we are a  just and truthful race.  You may go.\"    Turning, I left the audience chamber.  So this was the beginning of  Sarkoja's persecution!  I knew that none other could be responsible for  this report which had reached the ears of Lorquas Ptomel so quickly,  and now I recalled those portions of our conversation which had touched  upon escape and upon my origin.    Sarkoja was at this time Tars Tarkas' oldest and most trusted female.  As such she was a mighty power behind the throne, for no warrior had  the confidence of Lorquas Ptomel to such an extent as did his ablest  lieutenant, Tars Tarkas.    However, instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my mind,  my audience with Lorquas Ptomel only served to center my every faculty  on this subject.  Now, more than before, the absolute necessity for  escape, in so far as Dejah Thoris was concerned, was impressed upon me,  for I was convinced that some horrible fate awaited her at the  headquarters of Tal Hajus.    As described by Sola, this monster was the exaggerated personification  of all the ages of cruelty, ferocity, and brutality from which he had  descended.  Cold, cunning, calculating; he was, also, in marked  contrast to most of his fellows, a slave to that brute passion which  the waning demands for procreation upon their dying planet has almost  stilled in the Martian breast.    The thought that the divine Dejah Thoris might fall into the clutches  of such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me.  Far better  that we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last moment, as did  those brave frontier women of my lost land, who took their own lives  rather than fall into the hands of the Indian braves.    As I wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings Tars Tarkas  approached me on his way from the audience chamber.  His demeanor  toward me was unchanged, and he greeted me as though we had not just  parted a few moments before.    \"Where are your quarters, John Carter?\" he asked.    \"I have selected none,\" I replied.  \"It seemed best that I quartered  either by myself or among the other warriors, and I was awaiting an  opportunity to ask your advice.  As you know,\" and I smiled, \"I am not  yet familiar with all the customs of the Tharks.\"    \"Come with me,\" he directed, and together we moved off across the plaza  to a building which I was glad to see adjoined that occupied by Sola  and her charges.    \"My quarters are on the first floor of this building,\" he said, \"and  the second floor also is fully occupied by warriors, but the third  floor and the floors above are vacant; you may take your choice of  these.    \"I understand,\" he continued, \"that you have given up your woman to the  red prisoner.  Well, as you have said, your ways are not our ways, but  you can fight well enough to do about as you please, and so, if you  wish to give your woman to a captive, it is your own affair; but as a  chieftain you should have those to serve you, and in accordance with  our customs you may select any or all the females from the retinues of  the chieftains whose metal you now wear.\"    I thanked him, but assured him that I could get along very nicely  without assistance except in the matter of preparing food, and so he  promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care of  my arms and the manufacture of my ammunition, which he said would be  necessary.  I suggested that they might also bring some of the sleeping  silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat, for the nights  were cold and I had none of my own.    He promised to do so, and departed.  Left alone, I ascended the winding  corridor to the upper floors in search of suitable quarters.  The  beauties of the other buildings were repeated in this, and, as usual, I  was soon lost in a tour of investigation and discovery.    I finally chose a front room on the third floor, because this brought  me nearer to Dejah Thoris, whose apartment was on the second floor of  the adjoining building, and it flashed upon me that I could rig up some  means of communication whereby she might signal me in case she needed  either my services or my protection.    Adjoining my sleeping apartment were baths, dressing rooms, and other  sleeping and living apartments, in all some ten rooms on this floor.  The windows of the back rooms overlooked an enormous court, which  formed the center of the square made by the buildings which faced the  four contiguous streets, and which was now given over to the quartering  of the various animals belonging to the warriors occupying the  adjoining buildings.    While the court was entirely overgrown with the yellow, moss-like  vegetation which blankets practically the entire surface of Mars, yet  numerous fountains, statuary, benches, and pergola-like contraptions  bore witness to the beauty which the court must have presented in  bygone times, when graced by the fair-haired, laughing people whom  stern and unalterable cosmic laws had driven not only from their homes,  but from all except the vague legends of their descendants.    One could easily picture the gorgeous foliage of the luxuriant Martian  vegetation which once filled this scene with life and color; the  graceful figures of the beautiful women, the straight and handsome men;  the happy frolicking children--all sunlight, happiness and peace.  It  was difficult to realize that they had gone; down through ages of  darkness, cruelty, and ignorance, until their hereditary instincts of  culture and humanitarianism had risen ascendant once more in the final  composite race which now is dominant upon Mars.    My thoughts were cut short by the advent of several young females  bearing loads of weapons, silks, furs, jewels, cooking utensils, and  casks of food and drink, including considerable loot from the air  craft.  All this, it seemed, had been the property of the two  chieftains I had slain, and now, by the customs of the Tharks, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#15)"],[1,"read that in old times people often kept up  establishments and did other things which they could not afford for  ostentation, to make people think them richer than they were. Was it  really so, Mr. West?\"    \"I shall have to admit that it was,\" I replied.    \"Well, you see, it could not be so nowadays; for everybody's income is  known, and it is known that what is spent one way must be saved  another.\"      [1] I am informed since the above is in type that this lack of  perfection in the distributing service of some of the country districts  is to be remedied, and that soon every village will have its own set of  tubes.        Chapter 11    When we arrived home, Dr. Leete had not yet returned, and Mrs. Leete  was not visible. \"Are you fond of music, Mr. West?\" Edith asked.    I assured her that it was half of life, according to my notion.    \"I ought to apologize for inquiring,\" she said. \"It is not a question  that we ask one another nowadays; but I have read that in your day,  even among the cultured class, there were some who did not care for  music.\"    \"You must remember, in excuse,\" I said, \"that we had some rather absurd  kinds of music.\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"I know that; I am afraid I should not have fancied it  all myself. Would you like to hear some of ours now, Mr. West?\"    \"Nothing would delight me so much as to listen to you,\" I said.    \"To me!\" she exclaimed, laughing. \"Did you think I was going to play or  sing to you?\"    \"I hoped so, certainly,\" I replied.    Seeing that I was a little abashed, she subdued her merriment and  explained. \"Of course, we all sing nowadays as a matter of course in  the training of the voice, and some learn to play instruments for their  private amusement; but the professional music is so much grander and  more perfect than any performance of ours, and so easily commanded when  we wish to hear it, that we don't think of calling our singing or  playing music at all. All the really fine singers and players are in  the musical service, and the rest of us hold our peace for the main  part. But would you really like to hear some music?\"    I assured her once more that I would.    \"Come, then, into the music room,\" she said, and I followed her into an  apartment finished, without hangings, in wood, with a floor of polished  wood. I was prepared for new devices in musical instruments, but I saw  nothing in the room which by any stretch of imagination could be  conceived as such. It was evident that my puzzled appearance was  affording intense amusement to Edith.    \"Please look at to-day's music,\" she said, handing me a card, \"and tell  me what you would prefer. It is now five o'clock, you will remember.\"    The card bore the date \"September 12, 2000,\" and contained the longest  programme of music I had ever seen. It was as various as it was long,  including a most extraordinary range of vocal and instrumental solos,  duets, quartettes, and various orchestral combinations. I remained  bewildered by the prodigious list until Edith's pink finger tip  indicated a particular section of it, where several selections were  bracketed, with the words \"5 P.M.\" against them; then I observed that  this prodigious programme was an all-day one, divided into twenty-four  sections answering to the hours. There were but a few pieces of music  in the \"5 P.M.\" section, and I indicated an organ piece as my  preference.    \"I am so glad you like the organ,\" said she. \"I think there is scarcely  any music that suits my mood oftener.\"    She made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room, so far as I  could see, merely touched one or two screws, and at once the room was  filled with the music of a grand organ anthem; filled, not flooded,  for, by some means, the volume of melody had been perfectly graduated  to the size of the apartment. I listened, scarcely breathing, to the  close. Such music, so perfectly rendered, I had never expected to hear.    \"Grand!\" I cried, as the last great wave of sound broke and ebbed away  into silence. \"Bach must be at the keys of that organ; but where is the  organ?\"    \"Wait a moment, please,\" said Edith; \"I want to have you listen to this  waltz before you ask any questions. I think it is perfectly charming\";  and as she spoke the sound of violins filled the room with the witchery  of a summer night. When this had also ceased, she said: \"There is  nothing in the least mysterious about the music, as you seem to  imagine. It is not made by fairies or genii, but by good, honest, and  exceedingly clever human hands. We have simply carried the idea of  labor saving by cooperation into our musical service as into everything  else. There are a number of music rooms in the city, perfectly adapted  acoustically to the different sorts of music. These halls are connected  by telephone with all the houses of the city whose people care to pay  the small fee, and there are none, you may be sure, who do not. The  corps of musicians attached to each hall is so large that, although no  individual performer, or group of performers, has more than a brief  part, each day's programme lasts through the twenty-four hours. There  are on that card for to-day, as you will see if you observe closely,  distinct programmes of four of these concerts, each of a different  order of music from the others, being now simultaneously performed, and  any one of the four pieces now going on that you prefer, you can hear  by merely pressing the button which will connect your house-wire with  the hall where it is being rendered. The programmes are so coordinated  that the pieces at any one time simultaneously proceeding in the  different halls usually offer a choice, not only between instrumental  and vocal, and between different sorts of instruments; but also between  different motives from grave to gay, so that all tastes and moods can  be suited.\"    \"It appears to me, Miss Leete,\" I said, \"that if we could have devised  an arrangement for providing everybody with music in their homes,  perfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every mood, and  beginning and ceasing at will, we should have considered the limit of  human felicity already attained, and ceased to strive for further  improvements.\"    \"I am sure I never could imagine how those among you who depended at  all on music managed to endure the old-fashioned system for providing  it,\" replied Edith. \"Music really worth hearing must have been, I  suppose, wholly out of the reach of the masses, and attainable by the  most favored only occasionally, at great trouble, prodigious expense,  and then for brief periods, arbitrarily fixed by somebody else, and in  connection with all sorts of undesirable circumstances. Your concerts,  for instance, and operas! How perfectly exasperating it must have been,  for the sake of a piece or two of music that suited you, to have to sit  for hours listening to what you did not care for! Now, at a dinner one  can skip the courses one does not care for. Who would ever dine,  however hungry, if required to eat everything brought on the table? and  I am sure one's hearing is quite as sensitive as one's taste. I suppose  it was these difficulties in the way of commanding really good music  which made you endure so much playing and singing in your homes by  people who had only the rudiments of the art.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it was that sort of music or none for most of us.    \"Ah, well,\" Edith sighed, \"when one really considers, it is not so  strange that people in those days so often did not care for music. I  dare say I should have detested it, too.\"    \"Did I understand you rightly,\" I inquired, \"that this musical  programme covers the entire twenty-four hours? It seems to on this  card, certainly; but who is there to listen to music between say  midnight and morning?\"    \"Oh, many,\" Edith replied. \"Our people keep all hours; but if the music  were provided from midnight to morning for no others, it still would be  for the sleepless, the sick, and the dying. All our bedchambers have a  telephone attachment at the head of the bed by which any person who may  be sleepless can command music at pleasure, of the sort suited to the  mood.\"    \"Is there such an arrangement in the room assigned to me?\"    \"Why, certainly; and how stupid, how very stupid, of me not to think to  tell you of that last night! Father will show you about the adjustment  before you go to bed to-night, however; and with the receiver at your  ear, I am quite sure you will be able to snap your fingers at all sorts  of uncanny feelings if they trouble you again.\"    That evening Dr. Leete asked us about our visit to the store, and in  the course of the desultory comparison of the ways of the nineteenth  century and the twentieth, which followed, something raised the  question of inheritance. \"I suppose,\" I said, \"the inheritance of  property is not now allowed.\"    \"On the contrary,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"there is no interference with  it. In fact, you will find, Mr. West, as you come to know us, that  there is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty  nowadays than you were accustomed to. We require, indeed, by law that  every man shall serve the nation for a fixed period, instead of leaving  him his choice, as you did, between working, stealing, or starving.  With the exception of this fundamental law, which is, indeed, merely a  codification of the law of nature--the edict of Eden--by which it is  made equal in its pressure on men, our system depends in no particular  upon legislation, but is entirely voluntary, the logical outcome of the  operation of human nature under rational conditions. This question of  inheritance illustrates just that point. The fact that the nation is  the sole capitalist and land-owner of course restricts the individual's  possessions to his annual credit, and what personal and household  belongings he may have procured with it. His credit, like an annuity in  your day, ceases on"]]]
