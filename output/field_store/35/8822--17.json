For the greater part of the second round he  fought without knowing it. When Jimmy Silver called time he was in as  good case as ever, and the only effects of the blow on his head were a  vast lump underneath the hair, and a settled determination to win or  perish. In a few minutes the bell would ring for tea, and all his  efforts would end in nothing. It was no good fighting a draw with  Walton if he meant to impress the house. He knew exactly what Rumour,  assisted by Walton, would make of the affair in that case. \"Have you  heard the latest?\" A would ask of B. \"Why, Kennedy tried to touch  Walton up for not playing footer, and Walton went for him and would  have given him frightful beans, only they had to go down to tea.\"  There must be none of that sort of thing.    \"Time,\" said Jimmy Silver, breaking in on his meditations.    It was probably the suddenness and unexpectedness of it that took  Walton aback. Up till now his antagonist had been fighting strictly on  the defensive, and was obviously desirous of escaping punishment as  far as might be possible. And then the fall at the end of round one  had shaken him up, so that he could hardly fight at all at their  second meeting. Walton naturally expected that it would be left to him  to do the leading in round three. Instead of this, however, Kennedy  opened the round with such a lightning attack that Walton was all  abroad in a moment. In his most scientific mood he had never had the  remotest notion of how to guard. He was aggressive and nothing else.  Attacked by a quick hitter, he was useless. Three times Kennedy got  through his guard with his left. The third hit staggered him. Before  he could recover, Kennedy had got his right in, and down went Walton  in a heap.    He was up again as soon as he touched the boards, and down again  almost as soon as he was up. Kennedy was always a straight hitter, and  now a combination of good cause and bad temper--for the thought of the  foul in the first round had stirred what was normally a more or less  placid nature into extreme viciousness--lent a vigour to his left arm  to which he had hitherto been a stranger. He did not use his right  again. It was not needed.    Twice more Walton went down. He was still down when Jimmy Silver  called time. When the half-minute interval between the rounds was  over, he stated that he was not going on.    Kennedy looked across at him as he sat on a bed dabbing tenderly at  his face with a handkerchief, and was satisfied with the success of  his object-lesson. From his own face the most observant of headmasters  could have detected no evidence that he had been engaged in a vulgar  fight. Walton, on the other hand, looked as if he had been engaged in  several--all violent. Kennedy went off to his study to change, feeling  that he had advanced a long step on the thorny path that led to the  Perfect House.          XIV    FENN RECEIVES A LETTER      But the step was not such a very long one after all. What it amounted  to was simply this, that open rebellion ceased in Kay's. When Kennedy  put up the list on the notice-board for the third time, which he did  on the morning following his encounter with Walton, and wrote on it  that the match with Blackburn's would take place that afternoon, his  team turned out like lambs, and were duly defeated by thirty-one  points. He had to play a substitute for Walton, who was rather too  battered to be of any real use in the scrum; but, with that exception,  the team that entered the field was the same that should have entered  it the day before.    But his labours in the Augean stables of Kay's were by no means over.  Practically they had only begun. The state of the house now was  exactly what it had been under Fenn. When Kennedy had taken over the  reins, Kay's had become on the instant twice as bad as it had been  before. By his summary treatment of the revolution, he had, so to  speak, wiped off this deficit. What he had to do now was to begin to  improve things. Kay's was now in its normal state--slack, rowdy in an  underhand way, and utterly useless to the school. It was \"up to\"  Kennedy, as they say in America, to start in and make something  presentable and useful out of these unpromising materials.    What annoyed him more than anything else was the knowledge that if  only Fenn chose to do the square thing and help him in his work, the  combination would be irresistible. It was impossible to make any  leeway to speak of by himself. If Fenn would only forget his  grievances and join forces with him, they could electrify the house.    Fenn, however, showed no inclination to do anything of the kind. He  and Kennedy never spoke to one another now except when it was  absolutely unavoidable, and then they behaved with that painful  politeness in which the public schoolman always wraps himself as in a  garment when dealing with a friend with whom he has quarrelled.    On the Walton episode Fenn had made no comment, though it is probable  that he thought a good deal.    It was while matters were in this strained condition that Fenn  received a letter from his elder brother. This brother had been at  Eckleton in his time--School House--and had left five years before to  go to Cambridge. Cambridge had not taught him a great deal, possibly  because he did not meet the well-meant efforts of his tutor half-way.  The net result of his three years at King's was--_imprimis_, a  cricket blue, including a rather lucky eighty-three at Lord's;  secondly, a very poor degree; thirdly and lastly, a taste for  literature and the drama--he had been a prominent member of the  Footlights Club. When he came down he looked about him for some  occupation which should combine in happy proportions a small amount of  work and a large amount of salary, and, finding none, drifted into  journalism, at which calling he had been doing very fairly ever since.    \"Dear Bob,\" the letter began. Fenn's names were Robert Mowbray, the  second of which he had spent much of his time in concealing. \"Just a  line.\"    The elder Fenn always began his letters with these words, whether they  ran to one sheet or eight. In the present case the screed was not  particularly long.    \"Do you remember my reading you a bit of an opera I was writing? Well,  I finished it, and, after going the round of most of the managers, who  chucked it with wonderful unanimity, it found an admirer in Higgs, the  man who took the part of the duke in _The Outsider_. Luckily, he  happened to be thinking of starting on his own in opera instead of  farce, and there's a part in mine which fits him like a glove. So he's  going to bring it out at the Imperial in the spring, and by way of  testing the piece--trying it on the dog, as it were--he means to tour  with it. Now, here's the point of this letter. We start at Eckleton  next Wednesday. We shall only be there one night, for we go on to  Southampton on Thursday. I suppose you couldn't come and see it? I  remember Peter Brown, who got the last place in the team the year I  got my cricket colours, cutting out of his house (Kay's, by the way)  and going down town to see a piece at the theatre. I'm bound to admit  he got sacked for it, but still, it shows that it can be done. All the  same, I shouldn't try it on if I were you. You'll be able to read all  about the 'striking success' and 'unrestrained enthusiasm' in the  _Eckleton Mirror_ on Thursday. Mind you buy a copy.\"    The rest of the letter was on other subjects. It took Fenn less than a  minute to decide to patronise that opening performance. He was never  in the habit of paying very much attention to risks when he wished to  do anything, and now he felt as if he cared even less than usual what  might be the outcome of the adventure. Since he had ceased to be on  speaking terms with Kennedy, he had found life decidedly dull. Kennedy  had been his only intimate friend. He had plenty of acquaintances, as  a first eleven and first fifteen man usually has, but none of them  were very entertaining. Consequently he welcomed the idea of a break  in the monotony of affairs. The only thing that had broken it up to  the present had been a burglary at the school house. Some enterprising  marauder had broken in a week before and gone off with a few articles  of value from the headmaster's drawing-room. But the members of the  school house had talked about this episode to such an extent that the  rest of the school had dropped off the subject, exhausted, and  declined to discuss it further. And things had become monotonous once  more.    Having decided to go, Fenn began to consider how he should do it. And  here circumstances favoured him. It happened that on the evening on  which his brother's play was to be produced the headmaster was giving  his once-a-term dinner to the house-prefects. This simplified matters  wonderfully. The only time when his absence from the house was at all  likely to be discovered would be at prayers, which took place at  half-past nine. The prefects' dinner solved this difficulty for him.  Kay would not expect him to be at prayers, thinking he was over at the  Head's, while the Head, if he noticed his absence at all, would  imagine that he was staying away from the dinner owing to a headache  or some other malady. It seemed tempting Providence not to take  advantage of such an excellent piece of luck. For the rest, detection  was practically impossible. Kennedy's advent to the house had ousted  Fenn from the dormitory in which he had slept hitherto, and, there  being no bed available in any of the other dormitories, he had been  put into the spare room usually reserved for invalids whose invalidism  was not of a sufficiently infectious kind to demand their removal to  the infirmary. As for getting back into the house, he would leave the  window of his study unfastened.

Well?\"    \"As he was going past your study, a white figure emerged--\"    \"I should strongly advise you, young Barry,\" said Milton, gravely, \"not  to try and rot me in any way. You're a jolly good wing three-quarters,  but you shouldn't presume on it. I'd slay the Old Man himself if he  rotted me about this business.\"    Barry was quite pained at this sceptical attitude in one whom he was  going out of his way to assist.    \"I'm not rotting,\" he protested. \"This is all quite true.\"    \"Well, go on. You were saying something about white figures emerging.\"    \"Not white figures. A white figure,\" corrected Barry. \"It came out of  your study--\"    \"--And vanished through the wall?\"    \"It went into Rigby's dorm.,\" said Barry, sulkily. It was maddening to  have an exclusive bit of news treated in this way.      \"Did it, by Jove!\" said Milton, interested at last. \"Are you sure the  chap who told you wasn't pulling your leg? Who was it told you?\"    \"I promised him not to say.\"    \"Out with it, young Barry.\"    \"I won't,\" said Barry.    \"You aren't going to tell me?\"    \"No.\"    Milton gave up the point with much cheerfulness. He liked Barry, and he  realised that he had no right to try and make him break his promise.    \"That's all right,\" he said. \"Thanks very much, Barry. This may be  useful.\"    \"I'd tell you his name if I hadn't promised, you know, Milton.\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said Milton. \"It's not important.\"    \"Oh, there was one thing I forgot. It was a biggish chap the fellow  saw.\"    \"How big! My size?\"    \"Not quite so tall, I should think. He said he was about Seymour's  size.\"    \"Thanks. That's worth knowing. Thanks very much, Barry.\"    When his visitor had gone, Milton proceeded to unearth one of the  printed lists of the house which were used for purposes of roll-call.  He meant to find out who were in Rigby's dormitory. He put a tick  against the names. There were eighteen of them. The next thing was to  find out which of them was about the same height as Mr Seymour. It was a  somewhat vague description, for the house-master stood about five feet  nine or eight, and a good many of the dormitory were that height, or near  it. At last, after much brain-work, he reduced the number of \"possibles\"  to seven. These seven were Rigby himself, Linton, Rand-Brown, Griffith,  Hunt, Kershaw, and Chapple. Rigby might be scratched off the list at  once. He was one of Milton's greatest friends. Exeunt also Griffith,  Hunt, and Kershaw. They were mild youths, quite incapable of any deed  of devilry. There remained, therefore, Chapple, Linton, and Rand-Brown.  Chapple was a boy who was invariably late for breakfast. The inference  was that he was not likely to forego his sleep for the purpose of  wrecking studies. Chapple might disappear from the list. Now there  were only Linton and Rand-Brown to be considered. His suspicions fell  on Rand-Brown. Linton was the last person, he thought, to do such a  low thing. He was a cheerful, rollicking individual, who was popular with  everyone and seemed to like everyone. He was not an orderly member of  the house, certainly, and on several occasions Milton had found it  necessary to drop on him heavily for creating disturbances. But he was  not the sort that bears malice. He took it all in the way of business,  and came up smiling after it was over. No, everything pointed to  Rand-Brown. He and Milton had never got on well together, and quite  recently they had quarrelled openly over the former's play in the Day's  match. Rand-Brown must be the man. But Milton was sensible enough to  feel that so far he had no real evidence whatever. He must wait.    On the following afternoon Seymour's turned out to play Donaldson's.    The game, like most house-matches, was played with the utmost keenness.  Both teams had good three-quarters, and they attacked in turn.  Seymour's had the best of it forward, where Milton was playing a great  game, but Trevor in the centre was the best outside on the field, and  pulled up rush after rush. By half-time neither side had scored.    After half-time Seymour's, playing downhill, came away with a rush to  the Donaldsonites' half, and Rand-Brown, with one of the few decent  runs he had made in good class football that term, ran in on the left.  Milton took the kick, but failed, and Seymour's led by three points.  For the next twenty minutes nothing more was scored. Then, when five  minutes more of play remained, Trevor gave Clowes an easy opening, and  Clowes sprinted between the posts. The kick was an easy one, and what  sporting reporters term \"the major points\" were easily added.    When there are five more minutes to play in an important house-match,  and one side has scored a goal and the other a try, play is apt to  become spirited. Both teams were doing all they knew. The ball came out  to Barry on the right. Barry's abilities as a three-quarter rested  chiefly on the fact that he could dodge well. This eel-like attribute  compensated for a certain lack of pace. He was past the Donaldson's  three-quarters in an instant, and running for the line, with only the  back to pass, and with Clowes in hot pursuit. Another wriggle took him  past the back, but it also gave Clowes time to catch him up. Clowes was  a far faster runner, and he got to him just as he reached the  twenty-five line. They came down together with a crash, Clowes on  top, and as they fell the whistle blew.    \"No-side,\" said Mr. Aldridge, the master who was refereeing.    Clowes got up.    \"All over,\" he said. \"Jolly good game. Hullo, what's up?\"    For Barry seemed to be in trouble.    \"You might give us a hand up,\" said the latter. \"I believe I've twisted  my beastly ankle or something.\"          XV    A SPRAIN AND A VACANT PLACE      \"I say,\" said Clowes, helping him up, \"I'm awfully sorry. Did I do it?  How did it happen?\"    Barry was engaged in making various attempts at standing on the injured  leg. The process seemed to be painful.    \"Shall I get a stretcher or anything? Can you walk?\"    \"If you'd help me over to the house, I could manage all right. What a  beastly nuisance! It wasn't your fault a bit. Only you tackled me when  I was just trying to swerve, and my ankle was all twisted.\"    Drummond came up, carrying Barry's blazer and sweater.    \"Hullo, Barry,\" he said, \"what's up? You aren't crocked?\"    \"Something gone wrong with my ankle. That my blazer? Thanks. Coming  over to the house? Clowes was just going to help me over.\"    Clowes asked a Donaldson's junior, who was lurking near at hand, to  fetch his blazer and carry it over to the house, and then made his way  with Drummond and the disabled Barry to Seymour's. Having arrived at  the senior day-room, they deposited the injured three-quarter in a  chair, and sent M'Todd, who came in at the moment, to fetch the doctor.    Dr Oakes was a big man with a breezy manner, the sort of doctor who  hits you with the force of a sledge-hammer in the small ribs, and asks  you if you felt anything _then_. It was on this principle that he  acted with regard to Barry's ankle. He seized it in both hands and gave  it a wrench.    \"Did that hurt?\" he inquired anxiously.    Barry turned white, and replied that it did.    Dr Oakes nodded wisely.    \"Ah! H'm! Just so. 'Myes. Ah.\"    \"Is it bad?\" asked Drummond, awed by these mystic utterances.    \"My dear boy,\" replied the doctor, breezily, \"it is always bad when one  twists one's ankle.\"    \"How long will it do me out of footer?\" asked Barry.    \"How long? How long? How long? Why, fortnight. Fortnight,\" said the  doctor.    \"Then I shan't be able to play next Saturday?\"    \"Next Saturday? Next Saturday? My dear boy, if you can put your foot to  the ground by next Saturday, you may take it as evidence that the age  of miracles is not past. Next Saturday, indeed! Ha, ha.\"    It was not altogether his fault that he treated the matter with such  brutal levity. It was a long time since he had been at school, and he  could not quite realise what it meant to Barry not to be able to play  against Ripton. As for Barry, he felt that he had never loathed and  detested any one so thoroughly as he loathed and detested Dr Oakes at  that moment.    \"I don't see where the joke comes in,\" said Clowes, when he had gone.  \"I bar that man.\"    \"He's a beast,\" said Drummond. \"I can't understand why they let a tout  like that be the school doctor.\"    Barry said nothing. He was too sore for words.    What Dr Oakes said to his wife that evening was: \"Over at the school,  my dear, this afternoon. This afternoon. Boy with a twisted ankle. Nice  young fellow. Very much put out when I told him he could not play  football for a fortnight. But I chaffed him, and cheered him up in no  time. I cheered him up in no time, my dear.\"    \"I'm sure you did, dear,\" said Mrs Oakes. Which shows how differently  the same thing may strike different people. Barry certainly did not  look as if he had been cheered up when Clowes left the study and went  over to tell Trevor that he would have to find a substitute for his  right wing three-quarter against Ripton.    Trevor had left the field without noticing Barry's accident, and he was  tremendously pleased at the result of the game.    \"Good man,\" he said, when Clowes came in, \"you saved the match.\"    \"And lost the Ripton match probably,\" said Clowes, gloomily.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"That last time I brought down Barry I crocked him. He's in his study  now with a sprained ankle. I've just come from there. Oakes has seen  him, and says he mustn't play for a fortnight.\"    \"Great Scott!\" said Trevor, blankly. \"What on earth shall we do?\"    \"Why not move Strachan up to the wing, and put somebody else back "]]]
