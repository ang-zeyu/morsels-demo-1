For example, he retained the coinage minted under Nero  and Galba and Otho, evincing no displeasure at their images; and whatever  gifts had been bestowed upon any persons he held to be valid and deprived  no one of any such possession. He did not collect any sums still owing of  former public contributions, and he confiscated no one's property. A very  few of those who sided with Otho he put to death but did not withhold even  the property of these from their relatives. Upon the kinsmen of those  previously executed he bestowed all the funds that were found in the  public treasury. He did not obstruct the execution of the wills of such as  had fought against him and had fallen in the battles. Furthermore he  forbade the senators and the knights to fight as gladiators or to appear  in any spectacle in the orchestra. And for these measures he was  commended.]    [Sidenote:--7--] He was a constant attendant of the theatres, and this won  the attachment of the populace. He ate with the most influential men on  free and easy terms, and this gained their favor to an even greater  degree. His old companions he never failed to remember and honored them  greatly, not (like some others) disdaining to appear to recognize any of  them. Many persons have unexpectedly attained to great power feel hate for  those who are acquainted with their former humble state. [Vitellius, when  Priscus opposed him in the senate and denounced one of the soldiers,  called the tribunes to his side as if he had some need of their  assistance. He did not himself do Priscus any harm and did not allow the  officials to hurt him, but merely said: \"Be not indignant, Conscript  Fathers, that we two out of your number have had a little dispute with  each other.\" This act seemed to have been due to a kindly disposition. The  fact, however, that he wished to imitate Nero and offered sacrifices to  his Manes, and that he spent so great sums on dinners, though it caused  joy to some, made the sensible grieve, since they were fully aware that  not all the money in the whole world would be sufficient for him.]    [Sidenote:--8--] While he was behaving in this way, evil omens occurred. A  comet star was seen, and the moon contrary to precedent appeared to have  had two eclipses, being obscured by shadows on the fourth and on the  seventh day. Also people saw two suns at once, one in the west weak and  pale, and one in the east brilliant and powerful. On the Capitol many huge  footprints were seen, presumably of some spirits that had descended that  hill. The soldiers who had slept there the night in question said that the  temple of Jupiter had opened of itself with great clangor and some of the  guards were so terrified that they expired. At the same time that this  happened Vespasian, engaged in warfare with the Jews, [sent his son Titus  to the emperor Galba to give him a message. But when Titus returned,  having learned on the way] of the rebellion of Vitellius and of Otho, he  deliberated what ought to be done. [For Vespasian was in general not  rashly inclined and he hesitated very much about involving himself in such  troublous affairs.]    [Sidenote:--9--] But people favored him greatly: his reputation won in  Britain, his fame derived from the war under way, his kindheartedness and  prudence, all led them to desire to have him at their head. Likewise  Mucianus urged him strongly, hoping that Vespasian should get the name of  emperor and that he as a result of the other's good nature should enjoy an  equal share of power. Vespasian's soldiers on ascertaining all these facts  surrounded his tent and hailed him as emperor. Portents and dreams  pointing him out as sovereign long before had also fallen to the lot of  Vespasian, and these will be recited in the story of his life. For the  time being he sent Mucianus to Italy against Vitellius, while he himself,  after taking a look at affairs in Syria and entrusting to others the  conduct of the war against the Jews, proceeded to Egypt. There he  collected money, of which of course he needed a great deal, and grin,  which he desired to send in as large quantities as possible to Rome. The  soldiers in Moesia, hearing how matters stood with him, would not wait for  Mucianus,--they had learned that he was _en route_,--and chose as  their general Antonius Primus, [Footnote: _M. Antonius Primus._] who  had suffered sentence of exile in Nero's reign but had been restored by  Galba and was commander of the legion in Pannonia. This man held supreme  authority, although not chosen by the emperor nor by the senate. So great  was the soldiers' anger at Vitellius and their zest for plunder. They were  doing this for no other purpose except to pillage Italy. And their  intention was realized.    [Sidenote:--10--] Vitellius when he heard about it remained where he was  and went on with his luxurious living even to the extent of arranging  gladiatorial combats. In the course of these it was proposed that Sporus  portray the role of a maiden being ravished, but he would not endure the  shame and committed suicide. Vitellius gave the charge of the war to  Alienus [Footnote: _A. Caevina Alienus._] and certain others. Alienus  reached Cremona and occupied the town, but seeing that his own soldiers  were out of training as a result of their luxurious life in Rome and  impaired by lack of practice, whereas the others were physically well  exercised and stout of heart, he was afraid. Subsequently, when friendly  proposals came to him from Primus, he called the soldiers together and by  indicating the weakness of Vitellius and the strength of Vespasian  together with the character of the two men he persuaded them to revolt.  Then they removed the images of Vitellius from their standards and took an  oath that they would be governed by Vespasian. But, after the meeting had  broken up and they had retired to their tents, they changed their minds  and suddenly gathering excitedly in force with great outcry they again  saluted Vitellius as emperor and imprisoned Alienus for having betrayed  them, and they paid no heed to his consular office. Such are the regular  practices of civil wars.    [Sidenote:--11--] The great confusion which under these conditions  prevailed in the camp of Vitellius was increased that night by an eclipse  of the moon. It was not so much its being obscured (though even such  phenomena cause fear to men in excitement) as the fact that the luminary  appeared both blood-colored and black and reflected still other terrifying  shades. Not for this, however, would the men change their attitude or  yield: but when they encountered each other they contended most  vigorously, although, as I said, the Vitellians were leaderless; for  Alienus had been imprisoned at Cremona.    On the following day, when Primus through messengers tried to induce them  to come to terms, the soldiers of Vitellius sent a return message to him  urging that he espouse the cause of Vitellius. When, moreover, they joined  battle with his soldiers they contended most vigorously. The battle was  not the result of any concerted plan. Some few horsemen, as often happens  when two forces are encamped opposite each other, were out foraging in  front of the others and suddenly made an attack. After that reinforcements  came from both armies to each of the two parties in whatever order the  troops happened to become aware of the situation,--first to one side, then  to the other, now of one kind of fighting force, now of another, infantry  or cavalry: and the conflict was marked by vicissitudes until all had  hastened to the front. Then they got into some kind of regular formation  and carried on the struggle with some order even though leaderless.  Alienus, as you remember, had been imprisoned.    [Sidenote:--12--] From this point on the battle between them was a well  matched and evenly balanced affair, not only during the day but at night  as well. For the coming of night did not separate them. They were  thoroughly angry and determined, although they were acquainted with each  other and talked back and forth. Hence not hunger nor fatigue nor cold nor  darkness nor wounds nor deaths nor the remains of men that fell on this  field before [nor the memory of the disaster nor the number of those that  perished to no purpose] mitigated their fierceness. Such was the madness  that possessed both sides alike [and so eager were they, incited by the  very memories of the spot, which made one party resolved to conquer this  time also, and the other not to be conquered this time either. So they  fought as against foreigners instead of kindred, and as if all on both  sides were absolutely obliged either to perish at once or thereafter to be  slaves. Therefore, not even when night came on, as I stated, would they  yield; but though tired out and for that reason often resting and  indulging in conversation together, they nevertheless continued to  struggle]. As often as the moon shone out (it was constantly being  concealed by [numerous] clouds [of all shapes that kept passing in front  of it]), one might see them sometimes fighting, sometimes  [Sidenote:--13--] standing and leaning on their spears, sometimes sitting  down. Now and then they would shout in unison on one side the name of  Vespasian and on the other that of Vitellius, and again they would  challenge each other with abuse and praise of the two men. At intervals  one soldier would have a private chat with an opponent:--\"Comrade,  fellow-citizen, what are we doing? Why are we fighting? Come over to my  side.\" \"Oh, no, you come to my side.\" But what is there surprising about  this, considering that when the women of the city in the course of the  night brought food and drink to give to the soldiers of Vitellius, the  latter after eating and drinking themselves passed the supplies on to  their antagonists? One of them would call out the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#16)"],[1,"Mary  when she led forth the two children, in the bright sunshine of a delightful  summer day, to a cozy resting place among the rocks where the waves of Lake  Winnipeg rippled on the sandy beach at their feet.    Minnehaha was eager for a story about the sweet birdies or the brilliant  flowers, but the young invalid had his way this time, and Mary proceeded to  tell the story of the Indians' idea as to the origin of sickness and  disease.    \"Long, long ago,\" said Mary, \"all the animals and birds on this earth lived  in peace and harmony with the human family. Then there was food for all in  abundance without any shedding of blood. Even the wild animals, that now  live by killing and devouring each other, found plenty of food in the  fruits and vegetables that then were so abundant.    \"Men and women also lived on similar things, and were contented and happy.  But as the years went on the people became so numerous, and their  settlements spread over so much of the earth, that many of the poor animals  began to be cramped for room.    \"Even this could have been borne, but by and by men began to make bows and  arrows, spears and knives, and other weapons, and began to use them on the  defenseless animals. Then soon they began to eat the flesh of the animals,  and presently they found that they preferred the meat thus obtained to the  fruits and vegetables of the earth.    \"Formerly they had made their garments out of the fiber of the trees and  plants, which the women carefully prepared and wove; but after a while they  discovered that the skins of the buffalo and deer and other animals, when  well prepared, made better and more durable garments and wigwams than the  materials they had previously used. As time went on the destruction of  the larger animals increased, and men became so much more cruel than  formerly that even the frogs and worms, that in the earlier days were never  harmed, were now destroyed without mercy, or by sheer carelessness or  contempt. Thus the animals came to be in such a sad plight that it was  resolved by them to call great councils of their members together to  consult upon what could be done for their common safety.    \"The bears were the first to assemble. They gathered together on the peak  of a great smoky mountain, which the white men now call Cathedral mountain,  and the great white bear from the Northland was appointed chairman.\"    [Illustration: \"Which the white men now call Cathedral Mountain.\"]    \"Well, that was funny,\" said Minnehaha. \"Just fancy a big white bear  sitting up in a chair! Why, he would need a whole sofa to hold him.\"    \"Don't be silly, child,\" said the patronizing brother. \"It was a bears'  council and, of course, the chairs used were bears' and not men's.\"    When Mary was appealed to to settle the question she could only say, \"As  the council was held on the top of a mountain perhaps the bears sat on the  rocks. But never mind; let me go on with the story.    \"After the white bear had made his speech he took his seat and said he was  now ready to hear the statements of the different bears who had assembled  to lodge their complaints against the way in which men killed their  relatives, devoured their flesh for food, and made garments and robes out  of their skins.    \"Nearly every kind of bear had grievous statements to make, and so  blood-curdling were some of their recitals that it was decided to begin war  at once against the human race.    \"Then the question was asked, 'What weapons shall we use against them?'  After some discussion it was decided to use bows and arrows, the favorite  weapons of their enemies.    \"'And what are they made of?' was the next question.    \"This was soon answered by a bear who had been caught when young and kept  captive for a couple of years in the wigwam of one of their enemies. He had  often seen the process of making bows, and he was now able to tell all  about it, and even to do the work himself. It was not long before the first  bow, with some arrows, was manufactured, and there was great excitement  when the first trial of it was made. A large strong bear was selected to  shoot the first arrow. To their great disappointment the trial was not a  success, for it was found that when the bear let the arrow fly, after  drawing back the bow, his long claws caught in the string and spoiled the  shot. Other bears tried, but they all had long claws, and they all failed.  Then some one suggested that this difficulty could be overcome by their  cutting off their long claws. But here the chairman, the white bear,  interposed, saying that it was very necessary that they should have their  long claws in order to climb trees, or up steep rocky places. 'It is  better,' said he, 'for us to trust to our claws and teeth than to man's  weapons, which certainly were not designed for us.'    \"The bears remained in council until they got very hungry, but think as  much as they might they could not devise any satisfactory plan, for they  are stupid animals after all, and they dispersed to their different homes  no better able to fight the human race than before.    \"Then the deer next held a council. Representatives of all the different  kinds of deer, from the great elk and moose down to the smallest species in  existence, assembled in a beautiful forest glade. The moose was selected as  chief. After a long discussion it was resolved that in revenge for man's  tyranny they would inflict rheumatism, lumbago, and similar diseases upon  every hunter who should kill one of their number unless he took great care  to ask pardon for the offense. That is the reason why so many hunters say,  just before they shoot, 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Deer, but shoot you I must,  for I want your flesh for food.' They know that if they do this they are  safe.    \"The Cree legend is that it is the bear that has to be propitiated by  gentlemanly expressions when he is being approached to be killed. I well  remember being with a couple of hunters closely following up a bear, and  just before they fired they kept saying, 'Excuse us for shooting you,  Brother Bear, but we must do it. We want your warm fur robe, our families  want your meat, our girls want your grease to put on their heads, so you  must excuse us, Brother Bear. Please do, Brother Bear; please do.' Thus  they went on at a great rate until he was killed.    \"But many forget it, and the spirit of their chief knows it and is angry,  and he strikes those hunters, or their relatives, down with rheumatism or  some other painful disease.    \"Next the fishes and snakes and other reptiles held their council, and they  decided that as the human race had now become such enemies to them they  would trouble them with 'fearful dreams' of snakes twining about them, and  blowing their poisonous breath in their faces, by which they would lose  their appetites and die, while others of them would seek opportunity to  make the water they drank, or even the air they breathed, unwholesome. The  poisonous ones were also directed to use every opportunity to kill with  their deadly bites whenever possible.    \"The birds also held a council, over which the crow was appointed chairman.  The eagle objected, and wanted the place, but he was voted down because  there were so few of his kind, and these were only hunted for their  feathers to adorn the war bonnets of the great chiefs and warriors. The  crow was appointed because he was always with the human race and knew the  various schemes and tricks they were inventing to injure the birds and  animals of various kinds. After much deliberation the birds decided to give  colds, and coughs, and throat diseases, and consumption, to the human  race, and to thus lessen their numbers that there might be room for all  creatures.    \"The insects and smaller animals then held their council, and the grubworm  was appointed to preside over the gathering. He was so elated over his  election, and that they had arranged a scheme which should be fatal  especially to women, that he fell over backward and could not get on his  feet again. So from that time the grubworm has only been able to wiggle in  that way. There was any amount of talking and buzzing among the crowd. The  frog was especially noisy and angry in his remarks.    \"'It is high time,' said he, 'that we began to do something against this  cruel human race, or we will soon be swept off the earth. See how my back  is ugly with lumps and sores because men have so kicked and knocked me  about!'    \"Others followed in the same strain of indignant protest against man's  cruelty. Even the flies and mosquitoes had something to complain of.    \"Well, after the buzzing, and the croakings, and the hummings and angry  talkings were over, they settled down to business.    \"Some were appointed to poison the waters so that malarias and fevers  should attack the now hated race. Others, such as the flies and mosquitoes,  were to carry in their bites and stings many diseases. Thus it has come to  pass that there is more damage done to the hated human beings by these  bites and stings than the mere smarting pain caused at the time of the  bite. Thus, because the human race changed from being all kindness to the  rest of the creatures, both great and small, into being cruel and savage,  all these various creatures have combined to bring dreadful diseases among  men in revenge for their own wrongs.\"    \"That is too bad,\" said Minnehaha. \"Why could they not have kept on loving  each other all the time, instead of things being as they are now?\"    Sagastao, who had laughed at the idea of the mosquitoes coming to a  council, and of their having anything to complain of, said, \"I would like  to know what mosquitoes lived on in those good old days you speak about.  Now they are after me lively enough.\" And he slowly lifted up his hand, on  the back of which a couple were rapidly filling themselves with his blood.    But Mary, who, Indian like, was wise "]]]
