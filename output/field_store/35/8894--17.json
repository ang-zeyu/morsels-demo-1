ANAXAGORAS is said to have  been the first who supposed the universe created and governed by an  intelligence: ARISTOTLE reproaches him with having made an automaton  of this intelligence; or in other words, with ascribing to it the  production of things, only when he was at a loss to account for their  appearance. From whence it may be deduced, that it is for want of being  acquainted with the powers of Nature, or the properties of matter, that  man has multiplied beings without necessity--that he has supposed the  universe under the government of an intelligent cause, which he is, and  perhaps always will be, himself the model: in fine, this cause has been  personified under such a variety of shapes, sexes, and names, that  a list of the deities he has at various times supposed to guide this  Nature, or to whom he has submitted her, makes a large volume that  occupies some years of his youthful education to understand. He only  rendered this cause more inconceivable, when he extended in it his own  faculties too much. He either annihilates, or renders it altogether  impossible, when he would attach to it incompatible qualities, which  he is obliged to do, to enable him to account for the contradictory and  disorderly effects he beholds in the world. In fact, he sees confusion  in the world; yet, notwithstanding his confusion contradicts the  plan, the power, the wisdom, the bounty of this intelligence, and the  miraculous order which he ascribes to it; he says, the extreme beautiful  arrangement of the whole, obliges him to suppose it to be the work of  a sovereign intelligence: unable, however, to reconcile this seeming  confusion with the benevolence he attaches to this cause, he had  recourse to another effort of his imagination; he made a new cause,  to whom he ascribed all the evil, all the misery, resulting from this  confusion: still, his own person served for the model; to which he  added those deformities which he had learned to hold in disrespect: in  multiplying these counter or destroying causes, he peopled Pandemonium.    It will no doubt be argued, that as Nature contains and produces  intelligent beings, either she must be herself intelligent, or else she  must be governed by an intelligent cause. We reply, intelligence is  a faculty peculiar to organized beings, that it is to say, to beings  constituted and combined after a determinate manner; from whence results  certain modes of action, which are designated under various names;  according to the different effects which these beings produce: wine  has not the properties called _wit_ and _courage_; nevertheless, it  is sometimes seen that it communicates those qualities to men, who are  supposed to be in themselves entirely devoid of them. It cannot be  said Nature is intelligent after the manner of any of the beings she  contains; but she can produce intelligent beings by assembling matter  suitable to their particular organization, from whose peculiar modes of  action will result the faculty called intelligence; who shall be capable  of producing certain effects which are the necessary consequence of this  property. I therefore repeat, that to have intelligence, designs and  views, it is requisite to have ideas; to the production of ideas, organs  or senses are necessary: this is what is neither said of Nature nor  of the causes he has supposed to preside over her actions. In short  experience warrants the assertion, it does more, it proves beyond  a doubt, that matter, which is regarded as inert and dead, assumes  sensible action, intelligence, and life, when it is combined and  organized after particular modes.    From what has been said, it must rationally be concluded that _order_ is  never more than the necessary or uniform connection of causes with  their effects; or that series of action which flows from the peculiar  properties of beings, so long as they remain in a given state; that  _confusion_ is nothing more than the change of this state; that in the  universe, all is necessarily in order, because every thing acts and  moves according to the various properties of the different beings it  contains; that in Nature there cannot be either confusion or real evil,  since every thing follows the laws of its natural existence; that there  is neither _chance_ nor any thing fortuitous in this Nature, where no  effect is produced without a sufficient, without a substantial cause;  where all causes act necessarily according to fixed and certain laws,  which are themselves dependant on the essential properties of these  causes or beings, as well as on the combination, which constitutes  either their transitory or permanent state; that intelligence is a mode  of acting, a method of existence natural to some particular beings; that  if this intelligence should be attributed to Nature, it would then be  nothing more than the faculty of conserving herself in active existence  by necessary means. In refusing to Nature the intelligence he himself  enjoys--in rejecting the intelligent cause which is supposed to be the  contriver of this Nature, or the principle of that _order_ he discovers  in her course, nothing is given to _chance_, nothing to a blind cause,  nothing to a power which is indistinguishable; but every thing he  beholds is attributed to real, to known causes; or to those which by  analogy are easy of comprehension. All that exists is acknowledged to  be a consequence of the inherent properties of eternal matter, which by  contact, by blending, by combination, by change of form, produces order  and confusion; with all those varieties which assail his sight, it  is himself who is blind, when he imagines blind causes:--man only  manifested his ignorance of the powers of motion, of the laws of Nature,  when he attributed, any of its effects to _chance_. He did not shew a  more enlightened feeling when he ascribed them to an intelligence, the  idea of which he borrowed from himself, but which is never in conformity  with the effects which he attributes to its intervention--he only  imagined words to supply the place of things--he made JUPITER, SATURN,  JUNO, and a thousand others, operate that which he found himself  inadequate to perform; he distinguished them from Nature, gave them an  amplification of his own properties, and believed he understood them by  thus obscuring ideas, which he never dared either define or analyze.            CHAP. VI.    _Moral and Physical Distinctions of Man.--His Origin._      Let us now apply the general laws we have scrutinized, to those beings  of Nature who interest us the most. Let us see in what man differs from  the other beings by which he is surrounded. Let us examine if he has not  certain points in conformity with them, that oblige him, notwithstanding  the different properties they respectively possess, to act in certain  respects according to the universal laws to which every thing is  submitted. Finally, let us enquire if the ideas he has formed of himself  in meditating on his own peculiar mode of existence, be chimerical, or  founded in reason.    Man occupies a place amidst that crowd, that multitude of beings,  of which Nature is the assemblage. His essence, that is to say, the  peculiar manner of existence, by which he is distinguished from other  beings, renders him susceptible of various modes of action, of a variety  of motion, some of which are simple and visible, others concealed and  complicated. His life itself is nothing more than a long series, a  succession of necessary and connected motion; which operates perpetual  changes in his machine; which has for its principle either causes  contained within himself, such as blood, nerves, fibres, flesh, bones;  in short, the matter, as well solid as fluid, of which his body is  composed--or those exterior causes, which, by acting upon him, modify  him diversely; such as the air with which he is encompassed, the  aliments by which he is nourished, and all those objects from which  he receives any impulse whatever, by the impression they make on his  senses.    Man, like all other beings in Nature, tends to his own destruction--he  experiences inert force--he gravitates upon himself--he is attracted by  objects that are contrary or repugnant to his existence--he seeks after  some--he flies, or endeavours to remove himself from others. It is this  variety of action, this diversity of modification of which the human  being is susceptible, that has been designated under such different  names, by such varied nomenclature. It will be necessary, presently, to  examine these closely and go more into detail.    However marvellous, however hidden, however secret, however complicated  may be the modes of action, which the human frame undergoes, whether  interiorly or exteriorly; whatever may be, or appear to be the impulse  he either receives or communicates, examined closely, it will be found  that all his motion, all his operations, all his changes, all his  various states, all his revolutions, are constantly regulated by the  same laws, which Nature has prescribed to all the beings she brings  forth--which she developes--which she enriches with faculties--of which  she increases the bulk--which she conserves for a season--which she ends  by decomposing, by destroying: obliging them to change their form.    Man, in his origin, is an imperceptible point, a speck, of which the  parts are without form; of which the mobility, the life, escapes his  senses; in short, in which he does not perceive any sign of those  qualities, called SENTIMENT, FEELING, THOUGHT, INTELLIGENCE, FORCE,  REASON, &c. Placed in the womb suitable to his expansion, this point  unfolds, extends, increases, by the continual addition of matter he  attracts, that is analogous to his being, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#15)"],[1,"can a corporeal being  make an incorporeal being experience incommodious sensations? On the  other hand, _justice_, according to the only ideas man can ever form of  it, supposes, a permanent disposition to render to each what is due  to him; the theologian will not admit that the beings he has jumbled  together owe any thing to man; he insists that the benefits they bestow  are all the gratuitous effects of their own goodness; that they have  the right to dispose of the work of their hands according to their  own pleasure; to plunge it if they please into the abyss of misery; in  short, that their volition is the only guide of their conduct. It is  easy to see, that according to man's idea of justice, this does not  even contain the shadow of it; that it is, in fact, the mode of action  adopted by what he calls the most frightful tyrants. How then can he  be induced to call men just who act after this manner? Indeed, while  he sees innocence suffering, virtue in tears, crime triumphant, vice  recompensed, and at the same time, is told the beings whom theology has  invented are the authors, he will never be able to acknowledge them  to have _justice_. But he will find no such contradictory qualities in  nature, where every thing is the result of immutable laws: he will at  once perceive that these transient evils produce more permanent good;  that they are necessary to the conservation of the whole, or else result  from modifications of matter, which it is competent for him to change,  by altering his own mode of action; a lesson that nature herself teaches  him when he is willing to receive her instructions. But to form gods  with human passions, is to make them appear unjust; to say that such  beings chastise their friends for their own I good, is at once to  upset all the ideas he has either of kindness or unkindness: thus  the incompatible human qualities ascribed to these beings, do in fact  destroy their existence. If it be insisted they have the knowledge and  power of man, only that they are more extended, then it becomes a very  natural reply, to say, since they know every thing, they ought at least  to restrain mischief; because this would be the observation of man upon  the action of his fellows;--if it be urged these qualities are similar  to the same qualities possessed by man, then it may be fairly asked in  what do they differ? To this, if any answer be given, be what it may, it  will still be only changing the language: it will be invariably another  method of expressing the same thing; seeing that man with all his  ingenuity, will never be able to describe properties but after himself  or those of the beings by whom he is surrounded.    Where is the man filled with kindness, endowed with humanity, who does  not desire with all his heart to render his fellow creatures happy? If  these beings, as the theologians assert, really have man's qualities  augmented, would they not, by the same reasoning, exercise their  infinite power to render them all happy? Nevertheless, in despite of  these theologists, we scarcely find any one who is perfectly satisfied  with his condition on earth: for one mortal that enjoys, we behold  a thousand who suffer; for one rich man who lives in the midst of  abundance, there are thousands of poor who want common necessaries:  whole nations groan in indigence, to satisfy the passions of some  avaricious princes, of some few nobles, who are not thereby rendered  more contented--who do not acknowledge themselves more fortunate on  that account. In short, under the dominion of these beings, the earth  is drenched with the tears of the miserable. What must be the inference  from all this? That they are either negligent of, or incompetent to, his  happiness. But the mythologists will tell you coolly, that the judgments  of his gods are impenetrable! How do we understand this term? Not to be  taught--not to be informed--impervious--not to be pierced: in this case  it would be an unreasonable question to inquire by what authority do you  reason upon them? How do you become acquainted with these impenetrable  mysteries? Upon what foundation do you attribute virtues which you  cannot penetrate? What idea do you form to yourself of a justice that  never resembles that of man? Or is it a truth that you yourself are not  a man, but one of those impenetrable beings whom you say you represent?    To withdraw themselves from this, they will affirm that the justice of  these idols are tempered with mercy, with compassion, with goodness:  these again are human qualities: what, therefore, shall we understand by  them? What idea do we attach to mercy? Is it not a derogation from the  severe rules of an exact, a rigorous justice, which causes a  remission of some part of a merited punishment? Here hinges the great  incompatibility, the incongruity of those qualities, especially when  augmented by the word _omni_; which shews how little suitable human  properties are to the formation of divinities. In a prince, clemency is  either a violation of justice, or the exemption from a too severe law:  nevertheless, man approves of clemency in a sovereign, when its too  great facility does not become prejudicial to society; he esteems it,  because it announces humanity, mildness, a compassionate, noble soul;  qualities he prefers in his governors to rigour, cruelty, inflexibility:  besides, human laws are defective; they are frequently too severe; they  are not competent to foresee all the circumstances of every case: the  punishments they decree are not always commensurate with the offence:  he therefore does not always think them just: but he feels very well,  he understands distinctly, that when the sovereign extends his mercy, he  relaxes from his justice--that if mercy he merited, the punishment ought  not to take place--that then its exercise is no longer clemency, but  justice: thus he feels, that in his fellow creatures these two qualities  cannot exist at the same moment. How then is he to form his judgment of  beings who are represented to possess both in the extremest degree? Is  it not, in fact, announcing these beings to be men like ourselves, who  act with our imperfections on an enlarged scale?    They then say, well, but in the next world these idols will reward you  for all the evils you suffer in this: this, indeed, is something to  look to, if it could be contemplated alone; unmixed with all they have  formerly asserted: if we could also find that there was an unison of  thinking on this point--if there was a reasonable comprehensible view of  it held forth: but alas! here again human pleasures, human feelings, are  the basis on which these rewards are rested; only they are promised in a  way we cannot comprehend them; houris, or females who are to remain for  ever virgins, notwithstanding the knowledge of man, are so opposed to  all human comprehension, so opposite to all experience, are such mystic  assertions, that the human mind cannot possibly embrace an idea of  them: besides this is only promised by one class of these beings; others  affirm it will be altogether different: in short, the number of modes  in which this hereafter reward is promised to him, obliges man to ask  himself one plain question, Which is the real history of these blissful  abodes? At this question he staggers--he seeks for advice: each assures  him that the other is in error--that his peculiar mode is that which  will really have place; that to believe the other is a crime. How is  he to judge now? Take what course he will, he runs the chance of being  wrong; he has no standard whereby to measure the correctness of these  contradictory assurances; his mind is held suspended; he feels the  impossibility of the whole being right; he knows not that which he ought  to elect! Again, they have positively asserted these beings owe nothing  to man: how then is he to expect in a future life, a more real happiness  than he enjoys in the present? This they parry, by assuring him it  is founded upon their promises, contained in their revealed oracles.  Granted: but is he quite certain these oracles have emanated from  themselves? If they are so different in their detail, may there not  be reasonable ground for suspecting some of them are not authentic? If  there is, which are the spurious, which are the genuine? By what rule  is he to guide himself in the choice; how, with his frail methods  of judging, is he to scrutinize oracles delivered by such powerful  beings--to discriminate the true from the false? The ministers of each  will give you an infallible method, one that, is according to their  own asseveration, cannot err; that is, by an implicit belief in the  particular doctrine each promulgates.    Thus will be perceived the multitude of contradictions, the extravagant  hypotheses which these human attributes, with which theology clothes its  divinities, must necessarily produce. Beings embracing at one time so  many discordant qualities will always be undefinable--can only present a  train of ideas calculated to displace each other; they will consequently  ever remain beings of the imagination. These beings, say their  ministers, created the heavens, the earth, the creatures who inhabit  it, to manifest their own peculiar glory; they have neither rivals, nor  equals in nature; nothing which can be compared with them. Glory  is, again, a human passion: it is in man the desire of giving his  fellow-creatures an high opinion of him; this, passion is laudable when  it stimulates him to undertake great projects--when it determines him to  perform useful actions--but it is very frequently a weakness attached  to his nature; it is nothing more than a desire to be distinguished from  those beings with whom he compares himself, without exciting him to one  noble, one generous act. It is easy to perceive that beings who are so  much elevated above men, cannot be actuated by such a defective passion.  They say"]]]
