Andy heard, for his ears were sharpened: \"I thought for a minute--But it  does look like him!\"    \"Aw, Mike, I seen that gent in the barroom the other day. Besides, he's  just a kid.\"    \"So's this Lanning. I'm going out to look at the poster again. You hold  this gent here.\"    \"All right. I'll talk to him while you're gone. But be quick. I'll be  holdin' a laugh for you, Mike.\"    Andrew paid his bill, but as he reached the door a short man with legs  bowed by a life in the saddle waddled out to him and said: \"Just a  minute, partner. Are you one of us?\"    \"One of who?\" asked Andrew.    \"One of the posse Hal is getting together? Well, come to think of it, I  guess you're a stranger around here, ain't you?\"    \"Me?\" asked Andrew. \"Why, I've just been talking to Hal.\"    \"About young Lanning?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"By the way, if you're out of Hal's country, maybe you know Lanning,  too?\"    \"Sure. I've stood as close to him as I am to you.\"    \"You don't say so! What sort of a looking fellow is he?\"    \"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Andrew, and he smiled in an embarrassed  manner. \"They say he's a ringer for me. Not much of a compliment,  is it?\"    The other gasped, and then laughed heartily. \"No, it ain't, at that,\" he  replied. \"Say, I got a pal that wants to talk to you. Sort of a job on  him, at that.\"    \"I'll tell you what,\" said Andy calmly. \"Take him in to the bar, and  I'll come in and have a drink with him and you in about two  minutes. S'long.\"    He was gone through the door while the other half reached a hand toward  him. But that was all.    In the stables he had the saddle on the chestnut in twenty seconds, and  brought him to the watering trough before the barroom.    He found his short, bow-legged friend in the barroom in the midst of  excited talk with a big, blond man. He looked a German, with his parted  beard and his imposing front and he had the stern blue eye of a fighter.  \"Is this your friend?\" asked Andrew, and walked straight up to them. He  watched the eyes of the big man expand and then narrow; his hand even  fumbled at his hip, but then he shook his head. He was too bewildered  to act.    At that moment there was an uproar from the upper part of the hotel.  With a casual wave of his hand, Andy wandered out of the barroom and  then raced for the street. He heard men shouting in the lobby.    A fighting mass jammed its way into the open, and there, in the middle  of the square, sat Hal Dozier on his gray stallion. He was giving orders  in a voice that rang above the crowd, and made voices hush in whispers  as they heard him. Under his direction the crowd split into groups of  four and five and six and rode at full speed in three directions out of  the town. In the meantime there were two trusted friends of Hal Dozier  busy at telephones in the hotel. They were calling little towns among  the mountains. The red alarm was spreading like wildfire, and faster  than the fastest horse could gallop.    But Andrew, with the chestnut running like a red flash beneath him, had  vanished.    Buried away in the mountains, one stiff day's march, was a trapper whom  Uncle Jasper had once befriended. That was many a day long since, but  Uncle Jasper had saved the man's life, and he had often told Andrew  that, sooner or later, he must come to that trapper's cabin to talk of  the old times.    He was bound there now. For, if he could get shelter for three days, the  hue and cry would subside. When the mountaineers were certain that he  must have gone past them to other places and slipped through their  greedy fingers he could ride on in comparative safety. It was an  excellent plan. It gave Andrew such a sense of safety, as he trotted the  chestnut up a steep grade, that he did not hear another horse, coming in  the opposite direction, until the latter was almost upon him. Then,  coming about a sharp shoulder of the hill, he almost ran upon a  bare-legged boy, who rode without saddle upon the back of a bay mare.  The mare leaped catlike to one side, and her little rider clung like a  piece of her hide. \"You might holler, comin' around a turn,\" shrilled  the boy. And he brought the mare to a halt by jerking the rope around  her neck. He had no other means of guiding her, no sign of a bridle.    But Andrew looked with hungry eyes. He knew something of horses, and  this bay fitted into his dreams of an ideal perfectly. She was  beautiful, quite heavily built in the body, with a great spread of  breast that surely told of an honest heart beneath a glorious head, legs  that fairly shouted to Andrew of good blood, and, above all, she had  that indescribable thing which is to a horse what personality is to a  man. She did not win admiration, she commanded it. And she stood alert  at the side of the road, looking at Andrew like a queen. Horse stealing  is the cardinal sin in the mountain desert, but Andrew felt the moment  he saw her that she must be his. At least he would first try to buy her  honorably.    \"Son,\" he said to the urchin, \"how much for that horse?\"    \"Why,\" said the boy, \"anything you'll give.\"    \"Don't laugh at me,\" said Andrew sternly. \"I like her looks and I'll buy  her. I'll trade this chestnut--and he's a fine traveler--with a good  price to boot. If your father lives up the road and not down, turn back  with me and I'll see if I can't make a trade.\"    \"You don't have to see him,\" said the boy. \"I can tell you that he'll  sell her. You throw in the chestnut and you won't have to give any  boot.\" And he grinned.    \"But there's the house.\" He pointed across the ravine at a little  green-roofed shack buried in the rocks. \"You can come over if you  want to.\"    \"Is there something wrong with her?\"    \"Nothin' much. Pop says she's the best hoss that ever run in these  parts. And he knows, I'll tell a man!\"    \"Son, I've got to have that horse!\"    \"Mister,\" said the boy suddenly, \"I know how you feel. Lots feel the  same way. You want her bad, but she ain't worth her feed. A skunk put a  bur under the saddle when she was bein' broke, and since then anybody  can ride her bareback, but nothin' in the mountains can sit a saddle  on her.\"    Andrew cast one more long, sad look at the horse. He had never seen a  horse that went so straight to his heart, and then he straightened the  chestnut up the road and went ahead.          CHAPTER 19      He had to be guided by what Uncle Jasper had often described--a mountain  whose crest was split like the crown of a hat divided sharply by a  knife, and the twin peaks were like the ears of a mule, except that they  came together at the base. By the position of those distant summits he  knew that he was in the ravine leading to the cabin of Hank Rainer,  the trapper.    Presently the sun flashed on a white cliff, a definite landmark by which  Uncle Jasper had directed him, so Andrew turned out of his path on the  eastern side of the gully and rode across the ravine. The slope was  steep on either side, covered with rocks, thick with slides of loose  pebbles and sand. His horse, accustomed to a more open country, was  continually at fault. He did not like his work, and kept tossing his  ugly head and champing the bit as they went down to the river bottom.    It was not a real river, but only an angry creek that went fuming and  crashing through the canyon with a voice as loud as some great stream.  Andrew had to watch with care for a ford, for though the bed was not  deep the water ran like a rifle bullet over smooth places and was torn  to a white froth when it struck projecting rocks. He found, at length, a  place where it was backed up into a shallow pool, and here he rode  across, hardly wetting the belly of the gelding. Then up the far slope  he was lost at once in a host of trees. They cut him off from his  landmark, the white cliff, but he kept on with a feel for the right  direction, until he came to a sudden clearing, and in the clearing was a  cabin. It was apparently just a one-room shanty with a shed leaning  against it from the rear. No doubt the shed was for the trapper's horse.    He had no time for further thought. In the open door of the cabin  appeared a man so huge that he had to bend his head to look out, and  Andrew's heart fell. It was not the slender, rawboned youth of whom  Uncle Jasper had told him, but a hulking giant. And then he remembered  that twenty years had passed since Uncle Jasper rode that way, and in  twenty years the gaunt body might have filled out, the shock of  bright-red hair of which Jasper spoke might well have been the original  of the red flood which now covered the face and throat of the big man.    \"Hello!\" called the trapper. \"Are you one of the boys on the trail?  Well, I ain't seen anything. Been about six others here already.\"    The blood leaped in Andrew, and then ran coldly back to his heart.  Could they have outridden the gelding to such an extent as that?    \"From Tomo?\" he asked.    \"Tomo? No. They come down from Gunter City, up yonder, and Twin Falls.\"    And Andrew understood. Well indeed had Hal Dozier fulfilled his threat  of rousing the mountains against this quarry. He glanced westward. It  was yet an hour lacking of sundown, but since mid-morning Dozier had  been able to send his messages so far and so wide. Andrew set his teeth.  What did cunning of head and speed of horse count against the law when  the law had electricity for its agent?    \"Well,\" said Andrew, slipping from his saddle, \"if he hasn't been by  this way I may as well stay over for the night. If they've hunted the  woods around here all day, no use in me doing it by night. Can you  put me up?\"    \"Can I put you up? I'll tell a man. Glad to have you, stranger. Gimme  your hoss. I'll take care of him. Looks like he was kind of ganted up,  don't it? Well, I'll give him a feed of oats that'll thicken his ribs.\"    Still talking, he led the gelding into his shed. Andrew followed, took  off the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],[0,"Nightmare Abbey (#15)"],[1,"--'    'Joined together in holy matrimony--'    'Under which is carried a branch of the fifth pair of nerves--'    'I say, sir, when you are so shortly to be married to your cousin  Marionetta--'    'The _cavitas tympani_--'    A loud noise was heard behind the book-case, which, to the  astonishment of Mr Glowry, opened in the middle, and the massy  compartments, with all their weight of books, receding from each other  in the manner of a theatrical scene, with a heavy rolling sound (which  Mr Glowry immediately recognised to be the same which had excited his  curiosity,) disclosed an interior apartment, in the entrance of  which stood the beautiful Stella, who, stepping forward, exclaimed,  'Married! Is he going to be married? The profligate!'    'Really, madam,' said Mr Glowry, 'I do not know what he is going to  do, or what I am going to do, or what any one is going to do; for all  this is incomprehensible.'    'I can explain it all,' said Scythrop, 'in a most satisfactory manner,  if you will but have the goodness to leave us alone.'    'Pray, sir, to which act of the tragedy of the Great Mogul does this  incident belong?'    'I entreat you, my dear sir, leave us alone.'    Stella threw herself into a chair, and burst into a tempest of tears.  Scythrop sat down by her, and took her hand. She snatched her hand  away, and turned her back upon him. He rose, sat down on the other  side, and took her other hand. She snatched it away, and turned from  him again. Scythrop continued entreating Mr Glowry to leave them  alone; but the old gentleman was obstinate, and would not go.    'I suppose, after all,' said Mr Glowry maliciously, 'it is only a  phaenomenon in acoustics, and this young lady is a reflection of sound  from concave surfaces.'    Some one tapped at the door: Mr Glowry opened it, and Mr Hilary  entered. He had been seeking Mr Glowry, and had traced him to  Scythrop's tower. He stood a few moments in silent surprise, and then  addressed himself to Mr Glowry for an explanation.    'The explanation,' said Mr Glowry, 'is very satisfactory. The Great  Mogul has taken lodgings at Kensington, and the external part of the  ear is a cartilaginous funnel.'    'Mr Glowry, that is no explanation.'    'Mr Hilary, it is all I know about the matter.'    'Sir, this pleasantry is very unseasonable. I perceive that my niece  is sported with in a most unjustifiable manner, and I shall see if she  will be more successful in obtaining an intelligible answer.' And he  departed in search of Marionetta.    Scythrop was now in a hopeless predicament. Mr Hilary made a hue and  cry in the abbey, and summoned his wife and Marionetta to Scythrop's  apartment. The ladies, not knowing what was the matter, hastened in  great consternation. Mr Toobad saw them sweeping along the corridor,  and judging from their manner that the devil had manifested his wrath  in some new shape, followed from pure curiosity.    Scythrop meanwhile vainly endeavoured to get rid of Mr Glowry and  to pacify Stella. The latter attempted to escape from the tower,  declaring she would leave the abbey immediately, and he should never  see her or hear of her more. Scythrop held her hand and detained her  by force, till Mr Hilary reappeared with Mrs Hilary and Marionetta.  Marionetta, seeing Scythrop grasping the hand of a strange beauty,  fainted away in the arms of her aunt. Scythrop flew to her assistance;  and Stella with redoubled anger sprang towards the door, but was  intercepted in her intended flight by being caught in the arms of Mr  Toobad, who exclaimed--'Celinda!'    'Papa!' said the young lady disconsolately.    'The devil is come among you,' said Mr Toobad, 'how came my daughter  here?'    'Your daughter!' exclaimed Mr Glowry.    'Your daughter!' exclaimed Scythrop, and Mr and Mrs Hilary.    'Yes,' said Mr Toobad, 'my daughter Celinda.'    Marionetta opened her eyes and fixed them on Celinda; Celinda in  return fixed hers on Marionetta. They were at remote points of the  apartment. Scythrop was equidistant from both of them, central and  motionless, like Mahomet's coffin.    'Mr Glowry,' said Mr Toobad, 'can you tell by what means my daughter  came here?'    'I know no more,' said Mr Glowry, 'than the Great Mogul.'    'Mr Scythrop,' said Mr Toobad, 'how came my daughter here?'    'I did not know, sir, that the lady was your daughter.'    'But how came she here?'    'By spontaneous locomotion,' said Scythrop, sullenly.    'Celinda,' said Mr Toobad, 'what does all this mean?'    'I really do not know, sir.'    'This is most unaccountable. When I told you in London that I had  chosen a husband for you, you thought proper to run away from him; and  now, to all appearance, you have run away to him.'    'How, sir! was that your choice?'    'Precisely; and if he is yours too we shall be both of a mind, for the  first time in our lives.'    'He is not my choice, sir. This lady has a prior claim: I renounce  him.'    'And I renounce him,' said Marionetta.    Scythrop knew not what to do. He could not attempt to conciliate the  one without irreparably offending the other; and he was so fond of  both, that the idea of depriving himself for ever of the society  of either was intolerable to him: he therefore retreated into his  stronghold, mystery; maintained an impenetrable silence; and contented  himself with stealing occasionally a deprecating glance at each of the  objects of his idolatry. Mr Toobad and Mr Hilary, in the mean time,  were each insisting on an explanation from Mr Glowry, who they thought  had been playing a double game on this occasion. Mr Glowry was  vainly endeavouring to persuade them of his innocence in the whole  transaction. Mrs Hilary was endeavouring to mediate between her  husband and brother. The Honourable Mr Listless, the Reverend Mr  Larynx, Mr Flosky, Mr Asterias, and Aquarius, were attracted by the  tumult to the scene of action, and were appealed to severally and  conjointly by the respective disputants. Multitudinous questions, and  answers _en masse_, composed a _charivari_, to which the genius of  Rossini alone could have given a suitable accompaniment, and which  was only terminated by Mrs Hilary and Mr Toobad retreating with the  captive damsels. The whole party followed, with the exception of  Scythrop, who threw himself into his arm-chair, crossed his left  foot over his right knee, placed the hollow of his left hand on the  interior ancle of his left leg, rested his right elbow on the elbow  of the chair, placed the ball of his right thumb against his right  temple, curved the forefinger along the upper part of his forehead,  rested the point of the middle finger on the bridge of his nose, and  the points of the two others on the lower part of the palm, fixed his  eyes intently on the veins in the back of his left hand, and sat in  this position like the immoveable Theseus, who, as is well known to  many who have not been at college, and to some few who have, _sedet,  oeternumque sedebit_.[13] We hope the admirers of the _minutiae_ in  poetry and romance will appreciate this accurate description of a  pensive attitude.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER XIV      Scythrop was still in this position when Raven entered to announce  that dinner was on table.    'I cannot come,' said Scythrop.    Raven sighed. 'Something is the matter,' said Raven: 'but man is born  to trouble.'    'Leave me,' said Scythrop: 'go, and croak elsewhere.'    'Thus it is,' said Raven. 'Five-and-twenty years have I lived in  Nightmare Abbey, and now all the reward of my affection is--Go, and  croak elsewhere. I have danced you on my knee, and fed you with  marrow.'    'Good Raven,' said Scythrop, 'I entreat you to leave me.'    'Shall I bring your dinner here?' said Raven. 'A boiled fowl and  a glass of Madeira are prescribed by the faculty in cases of low  spirits. But you had better join the party: it is very much reduced  already.'    'Reduced! how?'    'The Honourable Mr Listless is gone. He declared that, what with  family quarrels in the morning, and ghosts at night, he could get  neither sleep nor peace; and that the agitation was too much for his  nerves: though Mr Glowry assured him that the ghost was only poor Crow  walking in his sleep, and that the shroud and bloody turban were a  sheet and a red nightcap.'    'Well, sir?'    'The Reverend Mr Larynx has been called off on duty, to marry or bury  (I don't know which) some unfortunate person or persons, at Claydyke:  but man is born to trouble!'    'Is that all?'    'No. Mr Toobad is gone too, and a strange lady with him.'    'Gone!'    'Gone. And Mr and Mrs Hilary, and Miss O'Carroll: they are all gone.  There is nobody left but Mr Asterias and his son, and they are going  to-night.'    'Then I have lost them both.'    'Won't you come to dinner?'    'No.'    'Shall I bring your dinner here?'    'Yes.'    'What will you have?'    'A pint of port and a pistol.'[14]    'A pistol!'    'And a pint of port. I will make my exit like Werter. Go. Stay. Did  Miss O'Carroll say any thing?'    'No.'    'Did Miss Toobad say any thing?'    'The strange lady? No.'    'Did either of them cry?'    'No.'    'What did they do?'    'Nothing.'    'What did Mr Toobad say?'    'He said, fifty times over, the devil was come among us.'    'And they are gone?'    'Yes; and the dinner is getting cold. There is a time for every  thing under the sun. You may as well dine first, and be miserable  afterwards.'    'True, Raven. There is something in that. I will take your advice:  therefore, bring me----'    'The port and the pistol?'    'No; the boiled fowl and Madeira.'    Scythrop had dined, and was sipping his Madeira alone, immersed in  melancholy musing, when Mr Glowry entered, followed by Raven, who,  having placed an additional glass and set a chair for Mr Glowry,  withdrew. Mr Glowry sat down opposite Scythrop. After a pause, during  which each filled and drank in silence, Mr"]]]
