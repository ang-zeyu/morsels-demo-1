He intended to rise, literally Phoenixlike, out of ashes. And the  next morning, in the red time of the dawn, he sat drinking the coffee  which George Washington Green had made for him and considering the  details of the problem. Clothes, which had been a main obstacle, were  now accounted for, since, as he had suspected, the packs of Godwin  contained a luxurious wardrobe of considerable compass. At that moment,  for instance, Donnegan was wrapped in a dressing gown of padded silk and  his feet were encased in slippers.    But clothes were the least part of his worries. To startle The Corner,  and thereby make himself attractive in the eyes of Nelly Lebrun,  overshadowing Jack Landis--that was the thing! But to startle The  Corner, where gold strikes were events of every twenty-four hours, just  now--where robberies were common gossip, and where the killings now  averaged nearly three a day--to startle The Corner was like trying to  startle the theatrical world with a sensational play. Indeed, this  parallel could have been pursued, for Donnegan was the nameless actor  and the mountain desert was the stage on which he intended to become a  headliner. No wonder, then, that his lean face was compressed in  thought. Yet no one could have guessed it by his conversation. At the  moment he was interrupted, his talk ran somewhat as follows.    \"George, Godwin taught you how to make coffee?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" from George. Since the night before he had appeared totally  subdued. Never once did he venture a comment. And ever Donnegan was  conscious of big, bright eyes watching him in a reverent fear not  untinged by superstition. Once, in the middle of the night, he had  wakened and seen the vast shadow of George's form leaning over the sack  of money. Murder by stealth in the dark had been in the giant's mind, no  doubt. But when, after that, he came and leaned over Donnegan's bunk,  the master closed his eyes and kept on breathing regularly, and finally  George returned to his own place--softly as a gigantic cat. Even in the  master's sleep he found something to be dreaded, and Donnegan knew that  he could now trust the fellow through anything. In the morning, at the  first touch of light, he had gone to the stores and collected  provisions. And a comfortable breakfast followed.    \"Godwin,\" resumed Donnegan, \"was talented in many ways.\"    The big man showed his teeth in silence; for since Godwin proposed the  sacrifice of the servant to preserve himself, George had apparently  altered his opinion of the gambler.    \"A talented man, George, but he knew nothing about coffee. It should  never boil. It should only begin to cream through the crust. Let that  happen; take the pot from the fire; put it back and let the surface  cream again. Do this three times, and then pour the liquid from the  grounds and you have the right strength and the right heating. You  understand?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And concerning the frying of bacon--\"    At this point the interruption came in the shape of four men at the open  door; and one of these Donnegan recognized as the real estate dealer,  who had shrewdly set up tents and shacks on every favorable spot in The  Corner and was now reaping a rich harvest. Gloster was his name. It was  patent that he did not see in the man in the silk dressing robe the  unshaven miscreant of the day before who had rented the two tents.    \"How'dee,\" he said, standing on the threshold, with the other three in  the background.    Donnegan looked at him and through him.    \"My name is Gloster. I own this shack and I've come to find out why  you're in it.\"    \"George,\" said Donnegan, \"speak to him. Tel! him that I know houses are  scarce in The Corner; that I found this place by accident vacant; that I  intend to stay in it on purpose.\"    George Washington Green instantly rose to the situation; he swallowed a  vast grin and strode to the door. And though Mr. Gloster's face  crimsoned with rage at such treatment he controlled his voice. In The  Corner manhood was apt to be reckoned by the pound, and George was a  giant.    \"I heard what your boss said, buddie,\" said Gloster. \"But I've rented  this cabin and the next one to these three gents and their party, and  they want a home. Nothing to do but vacate. Which speed is the thing I  want. Thirty minutes will--\"    \"Thirty minutes don't change nothing,\" declared George in his deep, soft  voice.    The real estate man choked. Then: \"You tell your boss that jumping a  cabin is like jumping a claim. They's a law in The Corner for gents like  him.\"    George made a gesture of helplessness; but Gloster turned to the three.    \"Both shacks or none at all,\" said the spokesman. \"One ain't big enough  to do us any good. But if this bird won't vamoose--\"    He was a tolerably rough-appearing sort and he was backed by two of a  kind. No doubt dangerous action would have followed had not George shown  himself capable of rising to a height. He stepped from the door; he  approached Gloster and said in a confidential whisper that reached  easily to the other three: \"They ain't any call for a quick play,  mister. Watch yo'selves. Maybe you don't know who the boss is?\"    \"And what's more, I don't care,\" said Gloster defiantly but with his  voice instinctively lowered. He stared past George, and behold, the man  in the dressing gown still sat in quiet and sipped his coffee.    \"It's Donnegan,\" whispered George.    \"Don--who's he?\"    \"You don't know Donnegan?\"    The mingled contempt and astonishment of George would have moved a thing  of stone. It certainly troubled Gloster. And he turned to the three.    \"Gents,\" he said, \"they's two things we can do. Try the law--and law's a  lame lady in these parts--or throw him out. Say which?\"    The three looked from Gloster to the shack; from the shack to Donnegan,  absently sipping his coffee; from Donnegan to George, who stood  exhibiting a broad grin of anticipated delight. The contrast was too  much for them.    There is one great and deep-seated terror in the mountain desert, and  that is for the man who may be other than he seems. The giant with the  rough voice and the boisterous ways is generally due for a stormy  passage west of the Rockies; but the silent man with the gentle manners  receives respect. Traditions live of desperadoes with exteriors of  womanish calm and the action of devils. And Donnegan sipping his morning  coffee fitted into the picture which rumor had painted. The three looked  at one another, declared that they had not come to fight for a house but  to rent one, that the real estate agent could go to the devil for all of  them, and that they were bound elsewhere. So they departed and left  Gloster both relieved and gloomy.    \"Now,\" said Donnegan to George, \"tell him that we'll take both the  shacks, and he can add fifty per cent to his old price.\"    The bargain was concluded on the spot; the money was paid by George.  Gloster went down the hill to tell The Corner that a mystery had hit the  town and George brought the canvas bag back to Donnegan with the top  still untied--as though to let it be seen that he had not pocketed any  of the gold.    \"I don't want to count it,\" said Donnegan. \"Keep the bag, George. Keep  money in your pocket. Treat both of us well. And when that's gone I'll  get more.\"    If the manner in which Donnegan had handled the renting of the cabins  had charmed George, he was wholly entranced by this last touch of free  spending. To serve a man who was his master was one thing; to serve one  who trusted him so completely was quite another. To live under the same  roof with a man who was a riddle was sufficiently delightful; but to be  allowed actually to share in the mystery was a superhappiness. He was  singing when he started to wash the dishes, and Donnegan went across the  hill to the tent of Lou Macon.    She was laying the fire before the tent; and the morning freshness had  cleared from her face any vestige of the trouble of the night before;  and in the slant light her hair was glorious, all ruffling gold,  semitransparent. She did not smile at him; but she could give the effect  of smiling while her face remained grave; it was her inward calm content  of which people were aware.    \"You missed me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You were worried?\"    \"No.\"    He felt himself put quietly at a distance. So he took her up the hill to  her new home--the shack beside his own; and George cooked her breakfast.  When she had been served, Donnegan drew the big man to one side.    \"She's your mistress,\" said Donnegan. \"Everything you do for her is  worth two things you do for me. Watch her as if she were in your eye.  And if a hair of her head is ever harmed--you see that fire burning  yonder--the bed of coals?\"    \"Sir?\"    \"I'll catch you and make a fire like that and feed you into it--by  inches!\"    And the pale face of Donnegan became for an instant the face of a demon.  George Washington Green saw, and never forgot.    Afterward, in order that he might think, Donnegan got on one of the  horses he had taken from Godwin and rode over the hills. They were both  leggy chestnuts, with surprising signs of blood' and all the earmarks of  sprinters; but in Godwin's trade sharp getaways were probably often  necessary. The pleasure he took in the action of the animal kept him  from getting into his problem.    How to startle The Corner? How follow up the opening gun which he had  fired at the expense of Gloster and the three miners?    He broke off, later in the day, to write a letter to Colonel Macon,  informing him that Jack Landis was tied hard and fast by Nelly Lebrun  and that for the present nothing could be done except wait, unless the  colonel had suggestions to offer.    The thought of the colonel, however, stimulated Donnegan. And before  midafternoon he had thought of a thing to do.          17      The bar in Milligan's was not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#16)"],[1,"spake: \"O life in glory shrin'd!\"  Who didst the largess of our kingly court  Set down with faithful pen! let now thy voice  Of hope the praises in this height resound.  For thou, who figur'st them in shapes, as clear,  As Jesus stood before thee, well can'st speak them.\"    \"Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:  For that, which hither from the mortal world  Arriveth, must be ripen'd in our beam.\"    Such cheering accents from the second flame  Assur'd me; and mine eyes I lifted up  Unto the mountains that had bow'd them late  With over-heavy burden.  \"Sith our Liege  Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,  In the most secret council, with his lords  Shouldst be confronted, so that having view'd  The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith  Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate  With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,  What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,  And whence thou hadst it?\"  Thus proceeding still,  The second light: and she, whose gentle love  My soaring pennons in that lofty flight  Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin'd:  Among her sons, not one more full of hope,  Hath the church militant: so 't is of him  Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb  Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term  Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,  From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.  The other points, both which thou hast inquir'd,  Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell  How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him  Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,  And without boasting, so God give him grace.\"  Like to the scholar, practis'd in his task,  Who, willing to give proof of diligence,  Seconds his teacher gladly, \"Hope,\" said I,  \"Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,  Th' effect of grace divine and merit preceding.  This light from many a star visits my heart,  But flow'd to me the first from him, who sang  The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme  Among his tuneful brethren.  'Let all hope  In thee,' so speak his anthem, 'who have known  Thy name;' and with my faith who know not that?  From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,  In thine epistle, fell on me the drops  So plenteously, that I on others shower  The influence of their dew.\"  Whileas I spake,  A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,  Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,  Play'd tremulous; then forth these accents breath'd:  \"Love for the virtue which attended me  E'en to the palm, and issuing from the field,  Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires  To ask of thee, whom also it delights;  What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.\"    \"Both scriptures, new and ancient,\" I reply'd;  \"Propose the mark (which even now I view)  For souls belov'd of God. Isaias saith,  That, in their own land, each one must be clad  In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.  In terms more full,  And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth  This revelation to us, where he tells  Of the white raiment destin'd to the saints.\"  And, as the words were ending, from above,  \"They hope in thee,\" first heard we cried: whereto  Answer'd the carols all.  Amidst them next,  A light of so clear amplitude emerg'd,  That winter's month were but a single day,  Were such a crystal in the Cancer's sign.    Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,  And enters on the mazes of the dance,  Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,  Than to do fitting honour to the bride;  So I beheld the new effulgence come  Unto the other two, who in a ring  Wheel'd, as became their rapture.  In the dance  And in the song it mingled.  And the dame  Held on them fix'd her looks: e'en as the spouse  Silent and moveless.  \"This is he, who lay  Upon the bosom of our pelican:  This he, into whose keeping from the cross  The mighty charge was given.\"  Thus she spake,  Yet therefore naught the more remov'd her Sight  From marking them, or ere her words began,  Or when they clos'd.  As he, who looks intent,  And strives with searching ken, how he may see  The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire  Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I  Peer'd on that last resplendence, while I heard:  \"Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,  Which here abides not?  Earth my body is,  In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,  As till our number equal the decree  Of the Most High.  The two that have ascended,  In this our blessed cloister, shine alone  With the two garments.  So report below.\"    As when, for ease of labour, or to shun  Suspected peril at a whistle's breath,  The oars, erewhile dash'd frequent in the wave,  All rest; the flamy circle at that voice  So rested, and the mingling sound was still,  Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.  I turn'd, but ah! how trembled in my thought,  When, looking at my side again to see  Beatrice, I descried her not, although  Not distant, on the happy coast she stood.          CANTO XXVI    With dazzled eyes, whilst wond'ring I remain'd,  Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,  Issued a breath, that in attention mute  Detain'd me; and these words it spake: \"'T were well,  That, long as till thy vision, on my form  O'erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse  Thou compensate the brief delay.  Say then,  Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:    \"And meanwhile rest assur'd, that sight in thee  Is but o'erpowered a space, not wholly quench'd:  Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look  Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt  In Ananias' hand.\" I answering thus:  \"Be to mine eyes the remedy or late  Or early, at her pleasure; for they were  The gates, at which she enter'd, and did light  Her never dying fire.  My wishes here  Are centered; in this palace is the weal,  That Alpha and Omega, is to all  The lessons love can read me.\"  Yet again  The voice which had dispers'd my fear, when daz'd  With that excess, to converse urg'd, and spake:  \"Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,  And say, who level'd at this scope thy bow.\"    \"Philosophy,\" said I, ''hath arguments,  And this place hath authority enough  'T' imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,  Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,  Kindles our love, and in degree the more,  As it comprises more of goodness in 't.  The essence then, where such advantage is,  That each good, found without it, is naught else  But of his light the beam, must needs attract  The soul of each one, loving, who the truth  Discerns, on which this proof is built.  Such truth  Learn I from him, who shows me the first love  Of all intelligential substances  Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word  Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,  'I will make all my good before thee pass.'  Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim'st,  E'en at the outset of thy heralding,  In mortal ears the mystery of heav'n.\"    \"Through human wisdom, and th' authority  Therewith agreeing,\" heard I answer'd, \"keep  The choicest of thy love for God.  But say,  If thou yet other cords within thee feel'st  That draw thee towards him; so that thou report  How many are the fangs, with which this love  Is grappled to thy soul.\"  I did not miss,  To what intent the eagle of our Lord  Had pointed his demand; yea noted well  Th' avowal, which he led to; and resum'd:  \"All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,  Confederate to make fast our clarity.  The being of the world, and mine own being,  The death which he endur'd that I should live,  And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,  To the foremention'd lively knowledge join'd,  Have from the sea of ill love sav'd my bark,  And on the coast secur'd it of the right.  As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,  My love for them is great, as is the good  Dealt by th' eternal hand, that tends them all.\"    I ended, and therewith a song most sweet  Rang through the spheres; and \"Holy, holy, holy,\"  Accordant with the rest my lady sang.  And as a sleep is broken and dispers'd  Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,  With the eye's spirit running forth to meet  The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg'd;  And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;  So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems  Of all around him, till assurance waits  On better judgment: thus the saintly came  Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,  With the resplendence of her own, that cast  Their brightness downward, thousand miles below.  Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,  Recover'd; and, well nigh astounded, ask'd  Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw.    And Beatrice: \"The first diving soul,  That ever the first virtue fram'd, admires  Within these rays his Maker.\"  Like the leaf,  That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;  By its own virtue rear'd then stands aloof;  So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow'd.  Then eagerness to speak embolden'd me;  And I began: \"O fruit! that wast alone  Mature, when first engender'd!  Ancient father!  That doubly seest in every wedded bride  Thy daughter by affinity and blood!  Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold  Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,  More speedily to hear thee, tell it not.\"    It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,  Through the sleek cov'ring of his furry coat.  The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms  His outside seeming to the cheer within:  And in like guise was Adam's spirit mov'd  To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,  Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:  \"No need thy will be told, which I untold  Better discern, than thou whatever thing  Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see  In Him, who is truth's mirror, and Himself  Parhelion unto all things, and naught else  To him.  This wouldst thou hear; how long since God  Plac'd me high garden, from whose hounds  She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;  What space endur'd my season of delight;  Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish'd me;  And what the language, which I spake and fram'd  Not that I tasted of the tree, my"]]]
