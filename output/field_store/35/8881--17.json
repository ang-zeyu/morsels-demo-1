Any scientific theory must be ready to give an account  of all phenomena. A hypothesis to explain the origin of man must  explain all the facts.  How did man become a hairless animal? Darwin's  explanation is too puerile for any one professing to be a learned  scientist to give. He says that the females preferred males with the  least hair (?) until the hairy men gradually became extinct, because,  naturally, under such a regime, the hairy men would die off, and,  finally only hairless men to beget progeny would survive. What do  sensible, serious students think of this \"scientific\" explanation?  If  we try to take this explanation seriously, we find that the science of  phrenology teaches that females, as a rule, inherit the traits of  their fathers, and males the traits of their mothers. Hence, not the  males but the females would become hairless by this ridiculous  process.  How do evolutionists account for the hair left on the head  and other parts of the body? Why do men have beard, while women and  children do not? If the hair left on the body is vestigial, why is  there no hair on the back, where it was most abundant on our brute  ancestors?  Even Wallace, an evolutionist of Darwin's day, who did not  believe in the evolution of man, calls attention to the fact that even  the so-called vestigial hair on the human form is entirely absent from  the back, while it is very abundant and useful on the backs of the  monkey family.  If there was any good reason why the human brute  should lose his hair, why for the same reason, did not other species  of the monkey family lose their hair? Can it be explained by natural  selection? Was the naked brute better fitted to survive than the hairy  animal? Did man survive because he was naked, and the hairy brute  perish?  Evidently not, for the hairy brute still exists in great  abundance.    The best way to get rid of the hair of the brute is for some  reconstructing artist, like Prof. J. H. McGregor, to take it off. In a  picture widely copied by books in favor of evolution, photographed  from his \"restorations,\" the pithecanthropus, the Neanderthal man, and  the Cro-Magnon man are represented almost without hair on the body or  even without beard. Only the Neanderthal man has a tiny Charlie  Chaplin mustache. Their hair had not been combed for 1,000,000 years;  yet we could not detect it. A sympathetic artist can make a  \"restoration\" suit his fancy and support any theory.    If we are descended from simian stock, how did we come to lose our  tails? Would not the same causes, if any, cause all the species to  lose their tails? According to the laws of biometry, ought we not to  find a retrogression of sections of the human race, who would sport  simian tails and be clothed with simian hair? Or, could natural  selection explain the loss of the tail on the ground that all the  monkeys with tails died off, while the tailless ones survived, and  developed into human beings? In that case, a tail must have been a  fatal imperfection.        22. HYBRIDS      \"Hybrids would seem to be nature's most available means of producing  new species.\" Yet the sterility of hybrids defeats that possibility,  and rebukes the untruthful claim of the formation of new  species. Nature, with sword in hand, decrees the death of hybrids,  lest they might produce a new species. Moses wrote the rigid  unchanging law of nature, when he said that every living creature  would bring forth \"after its kind.\"    Species are immutable. One does not become another, or unite with  another to produce a third. Dogs do not become cats, nor interbreed to  produce another species.  A few species, so nearly related that we can  scarcely tell whether they are species or varieties, as the jackass  and the mare, may have offspring, but the offspring are sterile.  The  zebra and the mare may produce a zebulon, which is likewise  sterile. And so with the offspring of other groups intermediate  between species and varieties. A human being and ape can not beget an  ape-human, showing that they are not even nearly related species.    If evolution be true, we would expect a frequent interbreeding and  interchanging of species. Even Darwin admitted that species are  immutable. God declared it in his word, and stamps it indelibly on  every species. \"And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth the living  creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the  earth, after its kind'.\"-Gen. 1:24. How did Moses know this great  truth, unless he was told by inspiration of God?    Even plant-hybrids are not permanent. Darwin himself says: \"But plants  not propagated by seed, are of little importance to us, for their  endurance is only temporary.\"    Even if it could be proven that species, like varieties, are formed by  development, it does not follow that genera and families and classes  are so developed. But it has not been proved that a single species has  been added by development, much less orders, families and  genera. Evolution must account for every division and sub-division to  plant and animal life. Darwin answers the objection to the sterility  of hybrids by saying, \"We do not know.\"  \"But why,\" he says, \"in the  case of distinct species, the sexual elements should so generally have  become more or less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we  do not know.\" But God knows.        23. THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS      The instinct of animals is not due to their own intelligence.  It is  unerring, unchangeable, without improvement or deterioration. It  implies knowledge and wisdom of the highest order. It is beyond the  wisdom of man.  It comes direct from God. It is not learned nor gained  by experience. It is found in many species of animals, and even in a  child, until knowledge and reason make it unnecessary.    One of the most familiar illustrations is the instinct of the honey  bee. It builds its cells in exact geometric form and we compute, by  Calculus, that the form it uses produces the greatest capacity in  proportion to the amount of material used. Who taught the bee to build  its cell, displaying greater knowledge than that of many a college  graduate? Darwin says (Origin of Species), \"It can be clearly shown  that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely  those of the honey bee, could not possibly have been acquired by  habit.\" We quote from Granville's Calculus, p. 119: \"We know that the  shape of a bee cell is hexagonal, giving a certain capacity for honey  with the greatest possible economy of wax.\"  This is demonstrated by  the solution of a problem in this same Calculus. Darwin again says  (Origin of Species, vol. I, p. 342), \"We hear from mathematicians,  that bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made  their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount  of honey, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their  construction. It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with  fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells  of wax of the true form, though this is effected by a crowd of bees,  working in a dark room. Each cell, as is well known, is a hexagonal  prism, with the basal edges of its six sides, beveled so as to join an  inverted pyramid of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles,  and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one  side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of the three  adjoining cells on the opposite side.\"    Can any one suggest an improvement or show an imperfection?  If this  intelligence is the bee's own, which is far superior to that of the  ape, why did not the bee develop a human brain?    Yet in spite of Darwin's admission, he labors hard to show that \"There  is no real difficulty under changing conditions of life, in natural  selection accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct  which are in any way useful\"! How could the working bee conserve the  gains accumulated by experience or habit? The drone is the father and  the queen is the mother of the sterile female working bee. Neither  parent knows how to build a cell. How could they transmit their  knowledge or their habits to the working bee? Every new swarm of bees  would not know how to build their cells. There is no improvement from  generation to generation. Even if instinct in other animals could be  accounted for, evolution can not account for the instinct of the  working bees, since they are not descendants of other working bees,  from which they might inherit habits or instinct.    Is not the instinct of the bee the intelligence of God, disproving the  heresy of an absentee God? Here again we get a glimpse of the unerring  wisdom of God.    The immoveable oyster, the bee alive with divine intelligence, and the  sterile progeny of the jackass, are enough to upset the whole theory  of evolution.        24. SPECIAL CREATION: GEN. I      Evolution can not be true, because it contradicts the inspired word of  God. We do not speak arbitrarily and say, without proof, that whatever  contradicts the revealed word of God can not be true, although such an  attitude could be easily defended. Disregarding all the many other  cogent and legitimate arguments in support of a divine revelation, we  will appeal to the remarkable harmony between the story of Creation in  Genesis and the modern sciences. This could not be, if God had not  revealed to Moses the story of creation. Moses personally knew nothing  revealed by the sciences of today. And the man of that day who would  invent the story of creation, would be sure to conflict with one or  more of the following modern sciences: geology, astronomy, zoology,  biology, geography, chemistry, physics, anatomy, philology,  archaeology, history, ethics, religion, etc. There is not one chance  in a million that a writer of a fictitious account would not have run  amuck among many of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#15)"],[1,"must be a natural development and  not something forced or grafted upon individuals from without, by the  notion that social conditions are not natural. But in its notion of  a complete and all-inclusive end of development, the Hegelian theory  swallowed up concrete individualities, though magnifying The Individual  in the abstract. Some of Hegel's followers sought to reconcile the  claims of the Whole and of individuality by the conception of society as  an organic whole, or organism. That social organization is presupposed  in the adequate exercise of individual capacity is not to be doubted.  But the social organism, interpreted after the relation of the organs of  the body to each other and to the whole body, means that each individual  has a certain limited place and function, requiring to be supplemented  by the place and functions of the other organs. As one portion of the  bodily tissue is differentiated so that it can be the hand and the  hand only, another, the eye, and so on, all taken together making the  organism, so one individual is supposed to be differentiated for the  exercise of the mechanical operations of society, another for those of  a statesman, another for those of a scholar, and so on. The notion  of \"organism\" is thus used to give a philosophic sanction to class  distinctions in social organization--a notion which in its educational  application again means external dictation instead of growth.    3. Education as Training of Faculties. A theory which has had great  vogue and which came into existence before the notion of growth had much  influence is known as the theory of \"formal discipline.\" It has in view  a correct ideal; one outcome of education should be the creation of  specific powers of accomplishment. A trained person is one who can do  the chief things which it is important for him to do better than he  could without training: \"better\" signifying greater ease, efficiency,  economy, promptness, etc. That this is an outcome of education was  indicated in what was said about habits as the product of educative  development. But the theory in question takes, as it were, a short  cut; it regards some powers (to be presently named) as the direct and  conscious aims of instruction, and not simply as the results of growth.  There is a definite number of powers to be trained, as one might  enumerate the kinds of strokes which a golfer has to master.  Consequently education should get directly at the business of training  them. But this implies that they are already there in some untrained  form; otherwise their creation would have to be an indirect product of  other activities and agencies. Being there already in some crude form,  all that remains is to exercise them in constant and graded repetitions,  and they will inevitably be refined and perfected. In the phrase \"formal  discipline\" as applied to this conception, \"discipline\" refers both  to the outcome of trained power and to the method of training through  repeated exercise.    The forms of powers in question are such things as the faculties of  perceiving, retaining, recalling, associating, attending, willing,  feeling, imagining, thinking, etc., which are then shaped by exercise  upon material presented. In its classic form, this theory was expressed  by Locke. On the one hand, the outer world presents the material or  content of knowledge through passively received sensations. On the  other hand, the mind has certain ready powers, attention, observation,  retention, comparison, abstraction, compounding, etc. Knowledge results  if the mind discriminates and combines things as they are united and  divided in nature itself. But the important thing for education is  the exercise or practice of the faculties of the mind till they become  thoroughly established habitudes. The analogy constantly employed is  that of a billiard player or gymnast, who by repeated use of certain  muscles in a uniform way at last secures automatic skill. Even the  faculty of thinking was to be formed into a trained habit by repeated  exercises in making and combining simple distinctions, for which, Locke  thought, mathematics affords unrivaled opportunity.    Locke's statements fitted well into the dualism of his day. It seemed to  do justice to both mind and matter, the individual and the world. One of  the two supplied the matter of knowledge and the object upon which mind  should work. The other supplied definite mental powers, which were few  in number and which might be trained by specific exercises. The scheme  appeared to give due weight to the subject matter of knowledge, and  yet it insisted that the end of education is not the bare reception  and storage of information, but the formation of personal powers of  attention, memory, observation, abstraction, and generalization. It  was realistic in its emphatic assertion that all material whatever is  received from without; it was idealistic in that final stress fell upon  the formation of intellectual powers. It was objective and impersonal  in its assertion that the individual cannot possess or generate any true  ideas on his own account; it was individualistic in placing the end of  education in the perfecting of certain faculties possessed at the outset  by the individual. This kind of distribution of values expressed with  nicety the state of opinion in the generations following upon Locke.  It became, without explicit reference to Locke, a common-place of  educational theory and of psychology. Practically, it seemed to provide  the educator with definite, instead of vague, tasks. It made the  elaboration of a technique of instruction relatively easy. All that was  necessary was to provide for sufficient practice of each of the powers.  This practice consists in repeated acts of attending, observing,  memorizing, etc. By grading the difficulty of the acts, making each set  of repetitions somewhat more difficult than the set which preceded it,  a complete scheme of instruction is evolved. There are various ways,  equally conclusive, of criticizing this conception, in both its alleged  foundations and in its educational application. (1) Perhaps the most  direct mode of attack consists in pointing out that the supposed  original faculties of observation, recollection, willing, thinking,  etc., are purely mythological. There are no such ready-made powers  waiting to be exercised and thereby trained. There are, indeed, a great  number of original native tendencies, instinctive modes of action, based  on the original connections of neurones in the central nervous system.  There are impulsive tendencies of the eyes to follow and fixate light;  of the neck muscles to turn toward light and sound; of the hands to  reach and grasp; and turn and twist and thump; of the vocal apparatus to  make sounds; of the mouth to spew out unpleasant substances; to gag  and to curl the lip, and so on in almost indefinite number. But these  tendencies (a) instead of being a small number sharply marked off from  one another, are of an indefinite variety, interweaving with one another  in all kinds of subtle ways. (b) Instead of being latent intellectual  powers, requiring only exercise for their perfecting, they are  tendencies to respond in certain ways to changes in the environment  so as to bring about other changes. Something in the throat makes one  cough; the tendency is to eject the obnoxious particle and thus  modify the subsequent stimulus. The hand touches a hot thing; it is  impulsively, wholly unintellectually, snatched away. But the withdrawal  alters the stimuli operating, and tends to make them more consonant with  the needs of the organism. It is by such specific changes of organic  activities in response to specific changes in the medium that that  control of the environment of which we have spoken (see ante, p. 24) is  effected. Now all of our first seeings and hearings and touchings and  smellings and tastings are of this kind. In any legitimate sense of the  words mental or intellectual or cognitive, they are lacking in these  qualities, and no amount of repetitious exercise could bestow any  intellectual properties of observation, judgment, or intentional action  (volition) upon them.    (2) Consequently the training of our original impulsive activities is  not a refinement and perfecting achieved by \"exercise\" as one might  strengthen a muscle by practice. It consists rather (a) in selecting  from the diffused responses which are evoked at a given time those which  are especially adapted to the utilization of the stimulus. That is to  say, among the reactions of the body in general occur upon stimulation  of the eye by light, all except those which are specifically adapted to  reaching, grasping, and manipulating the object effectively are  gradually eliminated--or else no training occurs. As we have already  noted, the primary reactions, with a very few exceptions are too  diffused and general to be practically of much use in the case of the  human infant. Hence the identity of training with selective response.  (Compare p. 25.) (b) Equally important is the specific coordination of  different factors of response which takes place. There is not merely a  selection of the hand reactions which effect grasping, but of the  particular visual stimuli which call out just these reactions and no  others, and an establishment of connection between the two. But the  coordinating does not stop here. Characteristic temperature reactions  may take place when the object is grasped. These will also be brought  in; later, the temperature reaction may be connected directly with the  optical stimulus, the hand reaction being suppressed--as a bright flame,  independent of close contact, may steer one away. Or the child in  handling the object pounds with it, or crumples it, and a sound issues.  The ear response is then brought into the system of response. If a  certain sound (the conventional name) is made"]]]
