From the delirium of joy,  we fell into profound despondency and grief; we envied the fate of those  whom we had seen perish at our side, and we said to ourselves, when we  shall be destitute of every thing, and our strength begins to forsake us,  we will wrap ourselves up as well as we can, we will lay ourselves down on  this platform, the scene of so many sufferings, and there we will await  death with resignation. At last, to calm our despair, we wished to seek  some consolation in the arms of sleep; the day before we had been consumed  by the fire of a burning sun; this day, to avoid the fierceness of his  beams, we made a tent with the sails of the frigate: as soon as it was put  up, we all lay down under it, so that we could not perceive what was  passing around us. We then proposed to inscribe upon a board an account of  our adventures, to write all our names at the bottom of the narrative, and  to fasten it to the upper part of the mast, in the hope that it would reach  the government and our families.    After we had passed two hours, absorbed in the most cruel reflections, the  master gunner of the frigate wishing to go to the front of the raft, went  out of our tent; scarcely had he put his head out, when he turned towards  us, uttering a loud cry; joy was painted on his countenance, his hands were  stretched towards the sea, he scarcely breathed: all that he could say,  was, \"_Saved! see the brig close upon us_.\" And in fact, it was, at the  most, half a league distant, carrying a press of sail, and steering so as  to come extremely close to us; we precipitately left the tent: even those  whom enormous wounds, in the lower extremities, had confined for some days  past, always to lie down, crawled to the back part of the raft, to enjoy  the sight of this vessel, which was coming to deliver us from certain  death. We all embraced each other with transports that looked like  delirium, and tears of joy rolled down our cheeks, shrunk by the most cruel  privations. Every one seized handkerchiefs, or pieces of linen to make  signals to the brig, which was approaching rapidly. Others prostrating  themselves, fervently thanked Providence for our miraculous preservation.  Our joy redoubled when we perceived a great white flag at the foremast  head, and we exclaimed \"It is then to Frenchmen that we shall owe our  deliverance.\" We almost immediately recognised the brig to be the Argus: it  was then within two musket shot: we were extremely impatient to see her  clue up her sails; she lowered them at length, and fresh cries of joy rose  from our raft. The Argus came and lay-to on our starboard, within half a  pistol shot. The crew, ranged on the deck and in the shrouds, shewed, by  waving their hats and handkerchiefs, the pleasure they felt at coming to  the assistance of their unhappy countrymen. A boat was immediately hoisted  out; an officer belonging to the brig, whose name was Mr. Lemaigre, had  embarked in it, in order to have the pleasure of taking us himself from  this fatal machine. This officer, full of humanity and zeal, acquitted  himself of his mission in the kindest manner, and took himself, those that  were the weakest, to convey them into the boat. After all the others were  placed in it, Mr. Lemaigre came and took in his arms Mr. Correard, whose  health was the worst, and who was the most excoriated: he placed him at his  side in the boat, bestowed on him all imaginable cares, and spoke to him in  the most consoling terms.    In a short time we were all removed on board the Argus, where we met with  the lieutenant of the frigate, and some others of those who had been  shipwrecked. Pity was painted on every face, and compassion drew tears from  all who cast their eyes on us.    Let the reader imagine fifteen unfortunate men, almost naked; their bodies  and faces disfigured by the scorching beams of the sun; ten of the fifteen  were hardly able to move; our limbs were excoriated, our sufferings were  deeply imprinted on our features, our eyes were hollow, and almost wild,  and our long beards rendered our appearance still more frightful; we were  but the shadows of ourselves. We found on board the brig some very good  broth, which had been got ready; as soon as they perceived us, they added  some excellent wine to it; thus they restored our almost exhausted  strength; they bestowed on us the most generous care and attention; our  wounds were dressed, and the next day several of our sick began to recover;  however, some of us had a great deal to suffer; for they were placed  between decks, very near the kitchen, which augmented the almost  insupportable heat of these countries; the want of room in a small vessel,  was the cause of this inconvenience. The number of the shipwrecked was  indeed too great. Those who did not belong to the marine, were laid upon  cables, wrapped in some flags, and placed under the kitchen fire, which  exposed them to perish in the night; fire having broken out between decks,  about ten o'clock, which had like to have reduced the vessel to ashes; but  timely assistance was afforded, and we were saved for the second time. We  had scarcely escaped when some of us again become delirious: an officer of  the army wanted to throw himself into the sea, to go and look for his  pocket book; which he would have done had he not been prevented; others  were seized in a manner equally striking.    The commander and officers of the brig were eager to serve us, and kindly  anticipated our wants. They had just snatched us from death, by rescuing us  from our raft; their reiterated care rekindled in us the flame of life. Mr.  Renaud, the surgeon, distinguished himself by indefatigable zeal; he passed  the whole day in dressing our wounds; and during the two days that we  remained on board the brig, he exerted all the resources of his art, with a  degree of attention and gentleness which merit our eternal gratitude.    It was, in truth, time that our sufferings should have an end: they had  already lasted thirteen days; the strongest among us might, at the most,  have lived forty-eight hours more. Mr. Correard, felt that he must die in  the course of the day; yet he had a foreboding that we should be saved; he  said that a series of events so extraordinary was not destined to be buried  in oblivion: that providence would preserve some of us at least, to present  to mankind the affecting picture of our unhappy adventures.    Through how many terrible trials have we past! Where are the men who can  say that they have been more unfortunate than we have?    The manner in which we were saved is truly miraculous: the finger of heaven  is conspicuous in this event.    The Argus had been dispatched, from Senegal, to assist the shipwrecked  people belonging to the boats, and to look for the raft; for several days  it sailed along the coast without meeting us, and gave provisions to the  people from the boats who were crossing the great desert of Zaara; the  captain, thinking that it would be useless to look for our raft any longer,  steered his course towards the harbour from which he had been dispatched,  in order to announce that his search had been fruitless; it was when he was  running towards Senegal that we perceived him. In the morning he was not  above forty leagues from the mouth of the river, when the wind veered to  the South West; the captain, as by a kind of inspiration, said that they  ought to go about, the winds blew towards the frigate; after they had run  two hours on this tack, the man at the mast head, announced a vessel: when  the brig was nearer to us, by the aid of glasses, they perceived that it  was our raft. When we were taken up by the Argus, we asked this question:  Gentlemen have you been long looking for us? We were answered yes; but  that, however, the captain had not received any positive orders on the  subject; and that we were indebted to chance alone, for the good fortune of  having been met with. We repeat with pleasure the expression of Mr.  Parnajon, addressed to one of us. \"If they were to give me the rank of  captain of a frigate, I should feel a less lively pleasure, than that which  I experienced when I met your raft.\" Some persons said to us without  reserve, \"We thought you were all dead a week ago.\" We say that the  commander of the brig had not received positive orders to look for us. The  following were his instructions: \"Mr. de Parnajon, commanding the brig  Argus, will proceed to the side of the desert with his vessel, will employ  every means to assist the shipwrecked persons, who must have reached the  coast; and will supply them with such provisions and ammunition as they may  want; after having assured himself of the fate of these unfortunate  persons, he will endeavour to continue his course to the Medusa, to see  whether the currents have carried the raft towards her.\" This is all that  was said of our wretched machine. It is very certain, that, at the Island  of St. Louis, we were given up; our friends believed we had perished: this  is so true, that some, who were going to send letters to Europe, wrote that  one hundred and fifty unfortunate people had been placed on a raft, and  that it was impossible they should have escaped. It will not, perhaps, be  out of place, to mention here a conversation which took place respecting  us. In a pretty large company, some persons said: \"It is a pity that the  raft was abandoned; for there were many brave fellows on board; but their  sufferings are over; they are happier than we, for who knows how all this  will end.\" In short, as we were now found, the frigate steered again for  Senegal, and the next day we saw the land, for which we had been longing  for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#16)"],[1,"Buenos Ayres must get the opium before  we get the cigarettes, eh? Five cases come to London on Tuesday, Cy. Be  of good courage, my dear.\"    She patted the sallow cheek of the American with her jewelled fingers,  and turned aside, glancing about her.    \"Yes,\" murmured Kilfane. \"We are all present, Lola. I have had the room  prepared. Come, my children, let us enter the poppy portico.\"    He opened a door and stood aside, waving one thin yellow hand between  the first two fingers of which smouldered the drugged cigarette. Led by  Mrs. Sin the company filed into an apartment evidently intended for  a drawing-room, but which had been hastily transformed into an opium  divan.    Tables, chairs, and other items of furniture had been stacked against  one of the walls and the floor spread with rugs, skins, and numerous  silk cushions. A gas fire was alight, but before it had been placed an  ornate Japanese screen whereon birds of dazzling plumage hovered amid  the leaves of gilded palm trees. In the centre of the room stood a small  card-table, and upon it were a large brass tray and an ivory pedestal  exquisitely carved in the form of a nude figure having one arm upraised.  The figure supported a lamp, the light of which was subdued by a  barrel-shaped shade of Chinese workmanship.    Mollie Gretna giggled hysterically.    \"Make yourself comfortable, dear,\" she cried to Rita, dropping down upon  a heap of cushions stacked in a recess beside the fireplace. \"I am going  to take off my shoes. The last time, Cyrus, when I woke up my feet were  quite numb.\"    \"You should come down to my place,\" said Mrs. Sin, setting the leather  case on the little card-table beside the lamp. \"You have there your own  little room and silken sheets to lie in, and it is quiet--so quiet.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Mollie Gretna, \"I must come! But I daren't go alone. Will  you come with me, dear?\" turning to Rita.    \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"I may not like opium.\"    \"But if you do--and I know you will?\"    \"Why,\" said Rita, glancing rapidly at Pyne, \"I suppose it would be a  novel experience.\"    \"Let me arrange it for you,\" came the harsh voice of Mrs. Sin. \"Lucy  will drive you both down--won't you, my dear?\" The shadowed eyes glanced  aside at Sir Lucien Pyne.    \"Certainly,\" he replied. \"I am always at the ladies' service.\"    Rita Dresden settled herself luxuriously into a nest of silk and fur in  another corner of the room, regarding the baronet coquettishly through  her half-lowered lashes.    \"I won't go unless it is my party, Lucy,\" she said. \"You must let me  pay.\"    \"A detail,\" murmured Pyne, crossing and standing beside her.    Interest now became centred upon the preparations being made by Mrs.  Sin. From the attache case she took out a lacquered box, silken-lined  like a jewel-casket. It contained four singular-looking pipes, the parts  of which she began to fit together. The first and largest of these had  a thick bamboo stem, an amber mouthpiece, and a tiny, disproportionate  bowl of brass. The second was much smaller and was of some dark,  highly-polished wood, mounted with silver conceived in an ornate Chinese  design representing a long-tailed lizard. The mouthpiece was of jade.  The third and fourth pipes were yet smaller, a perfectly matched pair in  figured ivory of exquisite workmanship, delicately gold-mounted.    \"These for the ladies,\" said Mrs. Sin, holding up the pair.  \"You\"--glancing at Kilfane--\"have got your own pipe, I know.\"    She laid them upon the tray, and now took out of the case a little  copper lamp, a smaller lacquered box and a silver spatula, her jewelled  fingers handling the queer implements with a familiarity bred of habit.    \"What a strange woman!\" whispered Rita to Pyne. \"Is she an oriental?\"    \"Cuban-Jewess,\" he replied in a low voice.    Mrs. Sin carefully lighted the lamp, which burned with a short, bluish  flame, and, opening the lacquered box, she dipped the spatula into  the thick gummy substance which it contained and twisted the little  instrument round and round between her fingers, presently withdrawing it  with a globule of chandu, about the size of a bean, adhering to the end.  She glanced aside at Kilfane.    \"Chinese way, eh?\" she said.    She began to twirl the prepared opium above the flame of the lamp. From  it a slight, sickly smelling vapor arose. No one spoke, but all  watched her closely; and Rita was conscious of a growing, pleasurable  excitement. When by evaporation the chandu had become reduced to the  size of a small pea, and a vague spirituous blue flame began to dance  round the end of the spatula, Mrs. Sin pressed it adroitly into the tiny  bowl of one of the ivory pipes, having first held the bowl inverted for  a moment over the lamp. She turned to Rita.    \"The guest of the evening,\" she said. \"Do not be afraid. Inhale--oh, so  gentle--and blow the smoke from the nostrils. You know how to smoke?\"    \"The same as a cigarette?\" asked Rita excitedly, as Mrs. Sin bent over  her.    \"The same, but very, very gentle.\"    Rita took the pipe and raised the mouthpiece to the lips.        CHAPTER XIV. IN THE SHADE OF THE LONELY PALM    Persian opium of good quality contains from ten to fifteen percent  morphine, and chandu made from opium of Yezd would contain perhaps  twenty-five per cent of this potent drug; but because in the act of  smoking distillation occurs, nothing like this quantity of morphine  reaches the smoker. To the distilling process, also, may be due  the different symptoms resulting from smoking chandu and injecting  morphia--or drinking tincture of opium, as De Quincey did.    Rita found the flavor of the preparation to be not entirely unpleasant.  Having overcome an initial aversion, caused by its marked medicinal  tang, she grew reconciled to it and finished her first smoke without  experiencing any other effect than a sensation of placid contentment.  Deftly, Mrs. Sin renewed the pipe. Silence had fallen upon the party.    The second \"pill\" was no more than half consumed when a growing feeling  of nausea seized upon the novice, becoming so marked that she dropped  the ivory pipe weakly and uttered a faint moan.    Instantly, silently, Mrs. Sin was beside her.    \"Lean forward--so,\" she whispered, softly, as if fearful of intruding  her voice upon these sacred rites. \"In a moment you will be better.  Then, if you feel faint, lie back. It is the sleep. Do not fight against  it.\"    The influence of the stronger will prevailed. Self-control and judgment  are qualities among the first to succumb to opium. Rita ceased to think  longingly of the clean, fresh air, of escape from these sickly fumes  which seemed now to fill the room with a moving vacuum. She bent  forward, her chin resting upon her breast, and gradually the deathly  sickness passed. Mentally, she underwent a change, too. From an active  state of resistance the ego traversed a descending curve ending in  absolute passivity. The floor had seemingly begun to revolve and was  moving insidiously, so that the pattern of the carpet formed a series  of concentric rings. She found this imaginary phenomenon to be soothing  rather than otherwise, and resigned herself almost eagerly to the  delusion.    Mrs. Sin allowed her to fall back upon the cushions--so gently and so  slowly that the operation appeared to occupy several minutes and to  resemble that of sinking into innumerable layers of swansdown. The  sinuous figure bending over her grew taller with the passage of each  minute, until the dark eyes of Mrs. Sin were looking down at Rita from  a dizzy elevation. As often occurs in the case of a neurotic subject,  delusion as to time and space had followed the depression of the sensory  cells.    But surely, she mused, this could not be Mrs. Sin who towered so loftily  above her. Of course, how absurd to imagine that a woman could remain  motionless for so many hours. And Rita thought, now, that she had been  lying for several hours beneath the shadow of that tall, graceful, and  protective shape.    Why--it was a slender palm-tree, which stretched its fanlike foliage  over her! Far, far above her head the long, dusty green fronds projected  from the mast-like trunk. The sun, a ball of fiery brass, burned  directly in the zenith, so that the shadow of the foliage lay like a  carpet about her feet. That which she had mistaken for the ever-receding  eyes of Mrs. Sin, wondering with a delightful vagueness why they seemed  constantly to change color, proved to be a pair of brilliantly plumaged  parrakeets perched upon a lofty branch of the palm.    This was an equatorial noon, and even if she had not found herself to  be under the influence of a delicious abstraction Rita would not  have moved; for, excepting the friendly palm, not another vestige of  vegetation was visible right away to the horizon; nothing but an ocean  of sand whereon no living thing moved. She and the parrakeets were alone  in the heart of the Great Sahara.    But stay! Many, many miles away, a speck on the dusty carpet of the  desert, something moved! Hours must elapse before that tiny figure,  provided it were approaching, could reach the solitary palm.  Delightedly, Rita contemplated the infinity of time. Even if the figure  moved ever so slowly, she should be waiting there beneath the palm to  witness its arrival. Already, she had been there for a period which she  was far too indolent to strive to compute--a week, perhaps. She turned  her attention to the parrakeets. One of them was moving, and she noted  with delight that it had perceived her far below and was endeavoring to  draw the attention of its less observant companion to her presence. For  many hours she lay watching it and wondering why, since the one bird  was so singularly intelligent, its companion was equally dull. When she  lowered her eyes and looked out again across the sands, the figure had  approached so close as to be recognizable.    It was that of"]]]
