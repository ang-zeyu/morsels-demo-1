CLAUSES EXPRESSING DURATION OF TIME.    96. The time during which an act takes place or a condition exists may  be expressed not only by an adverb or accusative of time (91), or by use  of the preposition \"dum\", but also by a clause introduced by \"dum\":       Li venis dum vi forestis,        he came while (during-the-time-that) you were away.     Dum la sezonoj malpacis, ili forgesis pri la mondo,        while the seasons quarreled, they forgot about the world.     Ni ridas pro gxojo dum negxas,        we laugh for joy while it is snowing.                          CLAUSES EXPRESSING ANTICIPATION.    97. A clause expressing an action or condition as preceding or  anticipating that of the main verb is introduced by \"antaux ol\":       Mi foriros antaux ol vi venos, I shall depart before you (will) come.     Antaux ol vi riprocxis lin, li ne ploris,        before you reproached him, he did not weep.     Vi ploris antaux ol vi ridis,        you wept before (sooner than) you laughed.            THE INFINITIVE WITH \"ANSTATAUX\", \"POR\", \"ANTAUX OL\".    98. An infinitive may be substantively used with \"anstataux\" to express  substitution, with \"por\" to express purpose (Cf. Old English \"But what  went ye out for to see,\" Matt. xi, 8), and with \"antaux ol\" to express  anticipation. It is usually translated by the English infinitive in  \"-ing\":       Anstataux resti li foriris, instead of staying he went away.     Vi malhelpas anstataux helpi min, you hinder instead of helping me.     Ni venis por helpi vin, we came to help (in order to help) you.     Mi estas preta por iri merkredon,        I am ready to go (for going) Wednesday.     Li havos tro multe por fari, he will have too much to do.     Mi laboros antaux ol ripozi, I shall work before resting.     Antaux ol foriri, li dankis min, before going away, he thanked me.     Dio faris la mondon antaux ol doni gxin al la sezonoj,        God made the world before giving it to the seasons.    [Footnote: \"Substantive\" is the general name for nouns and pronouns,  that is, for words which indicate persons, things, etc., and may be used  as subject or object of a verb, complement of a preposition, etc.]    [Footnote: The infinitive may be used with \"antaux ol\" if its subject  is the same as the subject of the main verb. Otherwise the construction  explained in (97) must be used.]                       THE EXPRESSION OF A PART OF THE WHOLE.    99. After nouns indicating a quantity or portion of some indefinite  whole, the substantive expressing that indefinite whole is preceded by  the preposition \"da\", of:       Estas skatolo da cxerizoj tie, there is a box of cherries there.     Mi trovis grandan sakon da mono, I found a large bag of money.     Li havas teleron da viando, he has a plate of meat.     Post horoj da gxojo ofte venas horoj da malgxojo,        after hours of joy there often come hours of sorrow.    100. The preposition \"da\" must not be used if a quantity or portion of a  \"definite\" or \"limited\" whole is expressed. If the word indicating the  whole is limited by \"la\", it is thereby made definite:       Telero de la maturaj pomoj, a plate of the ripe apples.     Sako de la bona kafo, a sack of the good coffee.

DIOGENO KAJ ALEKSANDRO GRANDA.    Antaux multaj jaroj sagxa greka viro, Diogeno, logxis en granda urbo. Li  opiniis ke ju pli malmulte oni bezonas, des pli felicxa oni estas. Por  montri al la mondo ke li ne bezonas multe, kaj ke tial li havas suficxe  por esti felicxa, li logxis en granda malnova barelo, anstataux havi  domon. Anstataux kusxi nokte sur lito aux almenaux sur mola tapisxo, li  ecx dormis en tiu barelo. Oni multe parolis pri Diogeno en la urbo, ne  nur cxar li tiel logxis, sed ankaux pro liaj sagxaj diroj. Post kelke  da tempo (\"some time\") la regxo Aleksandro Granda venis tien por viziti  la urbon. Dum li estis tie li auxdis pri Diogeno, kaj demandis pri li.  \"Cxu li logxas en la urbo?\" Aleksandro diris. \"Kvankam vi ne konas lin,  mi opinias ke mi volas vidi tian viron.\" Oni respondis \"Diogeno estas  sagxa viro, sed anstataux logxi en domo, li preferas sidi la tutan  tempon en malnova barelo. Anstataux porti (\"wearing\") purajn vestojn, li  portas nur malpurajn cxifonojn, cxar li opinias ke ju pli malmulte li  bezonas, des pli felicxa li estos.\" Aleksandro diris \"Antaux ol foriri  de via lando mi vizitos tiun viron.\" Antaux ol li foriris de la urbo,  Aleksandro iris kun nombro da amikoj por viziti Diogenon, kaj trovis lin  en lia barelo. \"Cxu tiu viro volas paroli al mi?\" demandis Diogeno per  lauxta vocxo. Aleksandro Granda respondis \"Mi estas la regxo Aleksandro,  kaj mi volas koni vin. Mi vidas ke kvankam vi estas sagxa vi estas tre  malricxa. Cxu vi ne volas kelkajn novajn vestojn anstataux tiuj malpuraj  cxifonoj?\" Diogeno tuj diris \"Antaux ol vi venis kaj staris inter mi kaj  la suno, cxi tiu tre varme brilis sur min. Cxu vi venis por fari bruon  kaj por veki min?\" Aleksandro ridis kaj diris \"Mi vidas ke vi havas  suficxe por esti felicxa. Tial mi estas preta por foriri.\"                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Diogenes was a wise man who dwelt in a Greek city, many years ago. 2.  In order to show to the inconstant world that one does not need much in  order to be happy, he did not have even a house or a bed. 3. He stayed  day and night in a big barrel, instead of residing in a house. 4. He  preferred to wear old rags, instead of good clean clothes. 5. He said  \"The less one needs, the happier he will be.\" 6. While Alexander the  Great was visiting that city, people talked to him about Diogenes. 7.  They asked \"Are you acquainted-with that wise man?\" 8. Soon the king  went with a number of his friends to that-man's big barrel, in the  middle of the city. 9. Diogenes was asleep, but the noise of the loud  voices waked him, and he said angrily \"You are standing between me and  the sun! Will you not go away at once?\" 10. Although several of the men  laughed, Alexander said \"We did not come to quarrel with you. 11. I see  that you have enough to be happy, so instead of talking and making a  noise we shall leave (go away from) you at once.\" 12. Before Diogenes  could answer, Alexander had quietly walked away.                                     LESSON XXIII.                      ADVERBS EXPRESSING A PART OF THE WHOLE.    101. After adverbs used to indicate a quantity or portion of some  indefinite whole, as well as after nouns of such meaning (99), the  substantive expressing the indefinite whole is preceded by the  preposition \"da\":       Multe da bruo, much (a quantity of) noise.     Tiel malmulte da tempo, so little (such a small quantity of) time.     Kelke da pomoj, some (an indefinite number of) apples.    102. Verbs may be modified by an adverb and prepositional phrase  containing \"da\":       Li trinkis malmulte da akvo, he drank little (not much) water.     Estas multe da sablo en la dezerto, there is much sand in the desert.     Ju pli negxas, des pli multe da negxo kusxas sur la vojoj,        the more it snows, the more snow lies on the roads.    [Footnote: A prepositional phrase containing \"da\", whether following a  noun or an adverb, is sometimes called a \"partitive\" construction.]    103. It is evident from the above examples that an adverb followed  by \"da\" has a somewhat collective sense, indicating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#15)"],[1,"overcoats.  The rowing warmed me. We started to pull away from the ship. We could  see the dim outlines of the decks above, but we could not recognize  anybody.\"      MANY WOMEN ROWING    Mrs. William R. Bucknell's account of the part women played in the  rowing is as follows:    \"There were thirty-five persons in the boat in which the captain placed  me. Three of these were ordinary seamen, supposed to manage the boat,  and a steward.    \"One of these men seemed to think that we should not start away from  the sinking ship until it could be learned whether the other boats would  accommodate the rest of the women. He seemed to think that; more could  be crowded into ours, if necessary.    \"'I would rather go back and go down with the ship than leave under  these circumstances.' he cried.    \"The captain shouted to him to obey orders and to pull for a little  light that could just be discerned miles in the distance. I do not know  what this little light was. It may have been a passing fishing vessel,  which, of course could not know our predicament. Anyway, we never  reached it.    \"We rowed all night, I took an oar and sat beside the Countess de  Rothes. Her maid had an our and so did mine. The air was freezing cold,  and it was not long before the only man that appeared to know anything  about rowing commenced to complain that his hands were freezing: A woman  back of him handed him a shawl from about her shoulders.    \"As we rowed we looked back at the lights of the Titanic. There was  not a sound from her, only the lights began to get lower and lower,  and finally she sank. Then we heard a muffled explosion and a dull roar  caused by the great suction of water.    \"There was not a drop of water on our boat. The last minute before our  boat was launched Captain Smith threw aboard a bag of bread. I took  the precaution of taking a good drink of water before we started, so I  suffered no inconvenience from thirst.\"    Mrs. Lucien Smith, whose young husband perished, was another heroine. It  is related by survivors that she took turns at the oars, and then, when  the boat was in danger of sinking, stood ready to plug a hole with her  finger if the cork stopper became loose.    In another boat Mrs. Cornell and her sister, who had a slight knowledge  of rowing, took turns at the oars, as did other women.    The boat in which Mrs. J. J. Brown, of Denver, Col., was saved contained  only three men in all, and only one rowed. He was a half-frozen seaman  who was tumbled into the boat at the last minute. The woman wrapped him  in blankets and set him at an oar to start his blood. The second man was  too old to be of any use. The third was a coward.    Strange to say, there was room in this boat for ten other people. Ten  brave men would have received the warmest welcome of their lives if they  had been there. The coward, being a quartermaster and the assigned head  of the boat, sat in the stern and steered. He was terrified, and the  women had to fight against his pessimism while they tugged at the oars.    The women sat two at each oar. One held the oar in place, the other did  the pulling. Mrs. Brown coached them and cheered them on. She told them  that the exercise would keep the chill out of their veins, and she spoke  hopefully of the likelihood that some vessel would answer the wireless  calls. Over the frightful danger of the situation the spirit of this  woman soared.      THE PESSIMIST    And the coward sat in his stern seat, terrified, his tongue loosened  with fright. He assured them there was no chance in the world. He had  had fourteen years' experience, and he knew. First, they would have  to row one and a half miles at least to get out of the sphere of the  suction, if they did not want to go down. They would be lost, and nobody  would ever find them.    \"Oh, we shall be picked up sooner or later,\" said some of the braver  ones. No, said the man, there was no bread in the boat, no water; they  would starve--all that big boatload wandering the high seas with nothing  to eat, perhaps for days.    \"Don't,\" cried Mrs. Brown. \"Keep that to yourself, if you feel that way.  For the sake of these women and chil-dren, be a man. We have a smooth  sea and a fighting chance. Be a man.\"    But the coward only knew that there was no compass and no chart aboard.  They sighted what they thought was a fishing smack on the horizon,  showing dimly in the early dawn. The man at the rudder steered toward  it, and the women bent to their oars again. They covered several miles  in this way--but the smack faded into the distance. They could not see  it any longer. And the coward said that everything was over.    They rowed back nine weary miles. Then the coward thought they must stop  rowing, and lie in the trough of the waves until the Carpathia should  appear. The women tried it for a few moments, and felt the cold creeping  into their bodies. Though exhausted from the hard physical labor they  thought work was better than freezing.    \"Row again!\" commanded Mrs. Brown.    \"No, no, don't,\" said the coward.    \"We shall freeze,\" cried several of the women together. \"We must row. We  have rowed all this time. We must keep on or freeze.\"    When the coward still demurred, they told him plainly and once for all  that if he persisted in wanting them to stop rowing, they were going to  throw him overboard and be done with him for good. Something about the  look in the eye of that Mississippi-bred oarswoman, who seemed such a  force among her fellows, told him that he had better capitulate. And he  did.    COUNTESS ROTHES AN EXPERT OARSWOMAN    Miss Alice Farnam Leader, a New York physician, escaped from the Titanic  on the same boat which carried the Countess Rothes. \"The countess is an  expert oarswoman,\" said Doctor Leader, \"and thoroughly at home on the  water. She practically took command of our boat when it was found that  the seaman who had been placed at the oars could not row skilfully.  Several of the women took their place with the countess at the oars and  rowed in turns, while the weak and unskilled stewards sat quietly in one  end of the boat.\"        MEN COULD NOT ROW    \"With nothing on but a nightgown I helped row one of the boats for three  hours,\" said Mrs. Florence Ware, of Bristol, England.    \"In our boat there were a lot of women, a steward and a fireman. None of  the men knew anything about managing a small boat, so some of the women  who were used to boats took charge.    \"It was cold and I worked as hard as I could at an oar until we were  picked up. There was nothing to eat or drink on our boat.\"      DEATHS ON THE LIFE-BOATS    \"The temperature must have been below freezing,\" testified another  survivor, \"and neither men nor women in my boat were warmly clothed.  Several of them died. The officer in charge of the life-boat decided it  was better to bury the      {illust. caption = SURVIVORS OF THE GREAT MARINE DISASTER    The first authentic photograph,...}      {illust. caption = Copyright by Campbell Studio. N. Y.    COLONEL AND MRS. JOHN JACOB ASTOR    Mrs. Astor, nee Miss Madeline Force, was rescued. Colonel Astor who  bravely refused to take a place in the life-boats, went down with the  Titanic.}      bodies. Soon they were weighted so they would sink and were put  overboard. We could also see similar burials taking place from other  life-boats that were all around us.\"      GAMBLERS WERE POLITE    In one boat were two card sharps. With the same cleverness that enabled  them to win money on board they obtained places in the boats with the  women.    In the boat with the gamblers were women in their night-gowns and women  in evening dress. None of the boats were properly equipped with food,  but all had enough bread and water to keep the rescued from starving  until the expected arrival of help.    To the credit of the gamblers who managed to escape, it should be said  that they were polite and showed the women every courtesy. All they  wanted was to be sure of getting in a boat. That once accomplished, they  reverted to their habitual practice of politeness and suavity. They were  even willing; to do a little manual labor, refusing to let women do any  rowing.    The people on that particular boat were a sad group. Fathers had kissed  their daughters good-bye and husbands had parted from their wives. The  card sharps, however philosophized wonderfully about the will of the  Almighty and how strange His ways. They said that one must be prepared  for anything; that good always came from evil, and that every cloud had  a silvery lining{.}    \"Who knows?\" said one. \"It may be that everybody on board will be  saved.\" Another added: \"Our duty is to the living. You women owe it to  your relatives and friends not to allow this thing to wreck your reason  or undermine your health.\" And they took pains to see that all the women  who were on the life-boat had plenty of covering to keep them from the  icy blasts of the night.      HELP IN SIGHT    The survivors were in the life-boats until about 5.30 A. M. About 3 A.  M. faint lights appeared in the sky and all rejoiced to see what was  supposed to be the coming dawn, but after watching for half an hour  and seeing no change in the intensity of the light, the disappointed  sufferers realized it was the Northern Lights. Presently low down on  the horizon they saw a light which slowly resolved itself into a double  light, and they watched eagerly to see if the two lights would separate  and so prove to be only two of the boats, or whether these lights would  remain together, in which case they should expect them to be the lights  of a rescuing steamer.    To the inexpressible joy of all, they moved as one! Immediately the  boats were swung around and headed for the lights. Someone shouted:  \"Now, boys, sing!\" and everyone not too weak broke into song with \"Row  for the shore, boys.\" Tears came to the eyes of all as they realized  that safety was at hand."]]]
