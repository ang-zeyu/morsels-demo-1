OBLIGATIONS    A bond is a form of obligation.    Every enforcible bond must be in writing and under seal.    The maker of a bond by the act acknowledges a liability in the  form of a debt or a duty.    The maker of a bond is the \"obligor.\"    The party to whom it is made is the \"obligee.\"    The bond names the liability or indebtedness; then follows the  condition wherein it is stated the particular thing that the  obligor is to do, or not to do.    The penalty for the non-compliance with a bond is twice the amount  of the money involved.    It is often required that the bond shall be further guaranteed by  one or more sureties. These sureties may be required to certify  that they are worth a certain sum, free and clear of all  indebtedness.    Persons holding positions of financial trust, whether public or  private, may be, and most of them are, required to furnish bonds  for the faithful performance of their duties.    In the larger cities there are casualty and liability companies,  which, for a fixed or annual consideration, act as sponsors on  official and other forms of bond.    Where there are no such companies, as those just named, then  private citizens of known responsibility must be secured to go on  the bond.    In every case the amount of the bond or security is measured by  the responsibilities of the man from whom it is required.          CHAPTER XIX    LIFE INSURANCE        Life insurance may be defined to be \"A contract for the future  payment of a certain sum of money to a person specified in the  body of the policy, on conditions dependent on the length of some  particular person's life.\"    There are two parties to this contract--the insured and the  insurer.    The purpose of the insurer, if he take out the policy in his own  name, is to provide in a measure for the care of his family, or  other dependents, in the event of his death.    After a long experience with the death rates in all lands that  keep mortuary statistics, the actuaries of insurance companies can  now estimate with surprising accuracy the probable length of life  before any man of any age.    The methods of insurance companies mean to be scientific, but be  that as it may, they are certainly interesting.    HOW IT IS DONE    Let us take a young man of thirty, married, with one child, in  good health, and in receipt of a fair salary, but with no property  to leave his wife and little one in the event of his death.    To secure his dear ones, he decides to insure his life for, let us  say, $3,000.    He fills out the blank, in which his age and all the other  required information is given; then the insurance company's doctor  examines him and he is accepted as what is called \"a good risk.\"    Now, from its actuary tables, the company knows, with reasonable  accuracy, the number of years this young man should live, barring  accidents.    Already they have their tables of calculations for such cases.  They know what expense will be required in the way of rent,  clerks, advertising, etc., to care for this case till the  prospective, the inevitable end is reached.    On these calculations the immediate and all subsequent premiums or  payments are based.    The insurance company invests and reinvests the premiums, and the  total of these, it is estimated, will meet the expenses and the  amount of the policy at the time of its calculated expiration.    AS AN INVESTMENT    If the young man in question had the money, he would find it to  his advantage to buy a paid up policy, that is one on which no  further premiums would be required.    But, having the money for a paid up policy, could not the young  man, without any expense for clerk hire or rent, invest it, and  reinvest it with the interest, as long as he lived, and thus make  by insuring himself?    There can be no question as to that, provided always that the  young man lived out the calculated time, invested his insurance  money at once, and kept on investing it in \"safe things\" as long  as he lived. But how many young men are there who could or would  take this course?    It is much easier to save from our earnings than it is to invest  those earnings wisely.    FORMS OF LIFE INSURANCE    The straight life policy, payable to the heirs at death, is the  form in general use, but there are others.    There is yet another form, known as the \"endowment,\" which in  itself combines the usual life insurance with some of the  privileges of a savings bank.    The endowment policy, while payable if death should occur before a  fixed time, specifies the date when it shall be payable to the  insured himself, if he should live till that time.    In this case the family is secured, in the event of death, and the  insured has a guarantee for himself when he reaches life's  unproductive years.    The premiums on an endowment policy are necessarily greater than  those on a regular life, and the premiums increase with the  shortness of the time.    MUTUAL INSURANCE SOCIETIES    Seeing the vast sums accumulated by what are known as \"the old  line companies,\" despite their high salaries and great expenses,  working men throughout the world, but more particularly in the  United States, have banded together and formed mutual insurance  companies.    These companies, there are many of them, are known as societies,  and their local branches are called \"lodges,\" \"councils\" or a  similar name.    Properly conducted, these mutual societies should be able to  furnish insurance at about actual cost, for the expenses of  management and collections are small.    It can be said that some of them have been and are being well  managed, but others, like their predecessors, the old line  companies, have unfortunately been conducted for the enrichment of  their promoters.    The mutual insurance companies, like their more pretentious  prototypes, are now placed under the supervision of inspectors in  nearly all the states.    AMOUNTS OF POLICIES    In the society companies, there is a limit to the amount, usually  $3,000, for which one can be insured, but the regular companies  have no such limitation.    In the mutual insurance companies, the insured cannot leave his  insurance to his creditors, or to any one not within a certain  degree of kinship.    In the regular companies a man may insure for any amount he thinks  he can carry, and he can insure in the same way in any number of  companies, and he can leave the money to any one he may select, or  for any purpose he may choose.    Sometimes the policy is made payable to unnamed executors. These  may be named in a will made after he has taken out his policy.    POLICIES AS SECURITY    Sometimes a man, without real estate or other personal assets,  desires to raise a loan on his life insurance, which, it should be  said, is a form of personal property. In this case he may assign  his life policy, or his endowment policy, as security for the  loan.    Again, if he is not insured and has no shadow of an asset, he may  have his life insured for the benefit of another, in consideration  for a loan.    LAPSES    When there is a failure to meet premiums, the policy is said to  \"lapse\" or default.    Even in this case the insured has an equity.    Every policy, depending on the amount paid, has what is known as a  \"surrender value,\" and by proper process this may be collected  from the company.    In some states, if the insured fails to meet his premiums, the  company is compelled to pay on the policy at his death a sum  equivalent to that which he paid before default.    Some insurance policies have a clause stating that the contract  will be void in the event of the suicide of the holder. The  highest courts have set this clause aside. The ruling is that a  suicide is an insane man, and that his heirs should not be made to  suffer for his misfortune.    PROPRIETARY AND MUTUAL COMPANIES    The larger insurance companies may be either proprietary or  mutual, some are a combination of both.    The proprietary companies are corporations organized by a number  of men to conduct life insurance as a business enterprise.    Such a company must be regularly chartered, and is under the  supervision of the state department of insurance.    Mutual companies, as the name implies, are organized and are meant  to be managed for the benefit of the policy holders, who are also  regarded as stock holders, with the right to vote in the election  of officers and other company affairs.    Aiming to create a strong reserve fund to secure the policy  holders, the mutual life insurance companies usually charge a  little more in the way of premiums.    Many rich men have their lives insured for great amounts. This is  done that their heirs may not be forced to break up the estate, at  death, in order to settle the ordinary liabilities.    If it can be afforded, it is always well to carry some life  insurance.          CHAPTER XX    FIRE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE        We hear and know much about life insurance because, no doubt, it  has to do directly with the individual, and so has a personal  appeal; but there are other forms of insurance, forms that have to  do with things material, that play an important part in the  world's business.    LIKE GAMBLING    The gambling spirit, like the desire for stimulants and the  tobacco habit, seems to be well nigh universal.    Men bet on the turn of dice, the cutting of cards, or the tossing  of a coin, and we very properly denounce it as gambling. We take  money without giving an equivalent, or we part with it and have  nothing to show for the transfer.

He took the bag of money and handed it to the merchant. \"Take the bag  and count the money that is in it,\" he said. \"If anything is lacking,  I will pay it to you.\"    The merchant did as he was told. \"There is nothing lacking,\" he said,  \"but the ten pieces he has told you about; and I will give him these  as a reward.\"    \"No,\" said Al Mansour, \"it is for me to reward the man as he deserves.\"    Saying this, he ordered that ten gold pieces be given to the merchant  in place of those that were lacking. Then he rewarded the gardener  with ten more pieces for his honesty.    \"Your debt is paid. Think no more about it,\" he said.          THE COWHERD WHO BECAME A POET    I        In England there was once a famous abbey, called Whitby. It was so  close to the sea that those who lived in it could hear the waves  forever beating against the shore. The land around it was rugged,  with only a few fields in the midst of a vast forest.    In those far-off days, an abbey was half church, half castle. It was  a place where good people, and timid, helpless people could find  shelter in time of war. There they might live in peace and safety  while all the country round was overrun by rude and barbarous men.    One cold night in winter the serving men of the abbey were gathered  in the great kitchen. They were sitting around the fire and trying to  keep themselves warm.    Out of doors the wind was blowing. The men heard it as it whistled  through the trees and rattled the doors of the abbey. They drew up  closer to the fire and felt thankful that they were safe from the  raging storm. \"Who will sing us a song?\" said the master woodman as  he threw a fresh log upon the fire.    \"Yes, a song! a song!\" shouted some of the others. \"Let us have a good  old song that will help to keep us warm.\"    \"We can all be minstrels to-night,\" said the chief cook. \"Suppose we  each sing a song in turn. What say you?\"    \"Agreed! agreed!\" cried the others. \"And the cook shall begin.\"    The woodman stirred the fire until the flames leaped high and the  sparks flew out of the roof hole. Then the chief cook began his song.  He sang of war, and of bold rough deeds, and of love and sorrow.    After him the other men were called, one by one; and each in turn sang  his favorite song. The woodman sang of the wild forest; the plowman  sang of the fields; the shepherd sang of his sheep; and those who  listened forgot about the storm and the cold weather.    But in the corner, almost hidden from his fellows, one poor man was  sitting who did not enjoy the singing. It was Caedmon, the  cowherd. \"What shall I do when it comes my turn?\" he said to himself.  \"I  do not know any song. My voice is harsh and I cannot sing.\"    So he sat there trembling and afraid; for he was a timid, bashful man  and did not like to be noticed.    At last, just as the blacksmith was in the midst of a stirring song,  he rose quietly and went out into the darkness. He went across the  narrow yard to the sheds where the cattle were kept in stormy weather.    \"The gentle cows will not ask a song of me,\" said the poor man. He  soon found a warm corner, and there he lay down, covering himself with  the straw.    Inside of the great kitchen, beside the fire, the men were shouting  and laughing; for the blacksmith had finished his song, and it was  very pleasing.    \"Who is next?\" asked the woodman.    \"Caedmon, the keeper of the cows,\" answered the chief cook.    \"Yes, Caedmon! Caedmon!\" all shouted together. \"A song from Caedmon!\"  But when they looked, they saw that his seat was vacant.    \"The poor, timid fellow!\" said the blacksmith. \"He was afraid and has  slipped away from us.\"        II      In his safe, warm place in the straw, Caedmon soon fell asleep. All  around him were the cows of the abbey, some chewing their cuds, and  others like their master quietly sleeping. The singing in the kitchen  was ended, the fire had burned low, and each man had gone to his place.    Then Caedmon had a strange dream. He thought that a wonderful light  was shining around him. His eyes were dazzled by it. He rubbed them  with his hands, and when they were quite open he thought that he saw  a beautiful face looking down upon him, and that a gentle voice  said,--    \"Caedmon, sing for me.\"    At first he was so bewildered that he could not answer. Then he heard  the voice again.    \"Caedmon, sing something.\"    \"Oh, I cannot sing,\" answered the poor man.\" I do not know any song;  and my voice is harsh and unpleasant. It was for this reason that I  left my fellows in the abbey kitchen and came here to be alone.\"    \"But you _must_ sing,\" said the voice. \"You _must_ sing.\"    \"What shall I sing?\" he asked.    \"Sing of the creation,\" was the answer.    Then Caedmon, with only the cows as his hearers, opened his mouth and  began to sing. He sang of the beginning of things; how the world was  made; how the sun and moon came into being; how the land rose from the  water; how the birds and the beasts were given life.    [Illustration: Caedmon signing in the cow byre]    All through the night he sat among the abbey cows, and sang his  wonderful song. When the stable boys and shepherds came out in the  morning, they heard him singing; and they were so amazed that they  stood still in the drifted snow and listened with open mouths.    At length, others of the servants heard him, and were entranced by his  wonderful song. And one ran quickly and told the good abbess, or  mistress of the abbey, what strange thing had happened.    \"Bring the cowherd hither, that I and those who are with me may hear  him,\" said she.    So Caedmon was led into the great hall of the abbey. And all of the  sweet-faced sisters and other women of the place listened while he  sang again the wonderful song of the creation.    \"Surely,\" said the abbess, \"this is a poem, most sweet, most true,  most beautiful. It must be written down so that people in other places  and in other times may hear it read and sung.\"    So she called her clerk, who was a scholar, and bade him write the  song, word for word, as it came from Caedmon's lips. And this he did.    Such was the way in which the first true English poem was written. And  Caedmon, the poor cowherd of the abbey, was the first great poet of  England.          THE LOVER OF MEN        In the Far East there was once a prince whose name was Gautama. He  lived in a splendid palace where there was everything that could give  delight. It was the wish of his father and mother that every day of  his life should be a day of perfect happiness.    So this prince grew up to be a young man, tall and fair and graceful.  He had never gone beyond the beautiful gardens that surrounded his  father's palace. He had never seen nor heard of sorrow or sickness or  poverty. Everything that was evil or disagreeable had been carefully  kept out of his sight. He knew only of those things that give joy and  health and peace.    But one day after he had become a man, he said: \"Tell me about the  great world which, you say, lies outside of these palace walls. It  must be a beautiful and happy place; and I wish to know all about it.\"  \"Yes, it is a beautiful place,\" was the answer. \"In it there are  numberless trees and flowers and rivers and waterfalls, and other  things to make the heart glad.\"    \"Then to-morrow I will go out and see some of those things,\" he said.    His parents and friends begged him not to go. They told him that there  were beautiful things at home--why go away to see other things less  beautiful? But when they saw that his mind was set on going, they said  no more.    The next morning, Gautama sat in his carriage and rode out from the  palace into one of the streets of the city. He looked with wonder at  the houses on either side, and at the faces of the children who stood  in the doorways as he passed. At first he did not see anything that  disturbed him; for word had gone before him to remove from sight  everything that might be displeasing or painful.    Soon the carriage turned into another street--a street less carefully  guarded. Here there were no children at the doors. But suddenly, at  a narrow place, they met a very old man, hobbling slowly along over  the stony way.    \"Who is that man?\" asked Gautama, \"and why is his face so pinched and  his hair so white? Why do his legs tremble under him as he walks,  leaning upon a stick? He seems weak, and his eyes are dull. Is he some  new kind of man?\"    \"Sir,\" answered the coachman, \"that is an old man. He has lived more  than eighty years. All who reach old age must lose their strength and  become like him, feeble and gray.\"    \"Alas!\" said the prince. \"Is this the condition to which I must come?\"    \"If you live long enough,\" was the answer.    \"What do you mean by that? Do not all persons live eighty years--yes,  many times eighty years?\"    The coachman made no answer, but drove onward.    They passed out into the open country and saw the cottages of the poor  people. By the door of one of these a sick man was lying upon a couch,  helpless and pale.    \"Why is that man lying there at this time of day?\" asked the prince.  \"His face is white, and he seems very weak. Is he also an old man?\"    \"Oh, no! He is sick,\" answered the coachman. \"Poor people are often  sick.\" \"What does that mean?\" asked the prince. \"Why are they sick?\"    The coachman explained as well as he was able; and they rode onward.    Soon they saw a company of men toiling by the roadside. Their faces  were browned by the sun; their hands were hard and gnarly; their backs  were bent by much heavy lifting; their clothing was"]]]
