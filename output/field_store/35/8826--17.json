Not only is the vacuum tube a detector of electric wave signals and  speech and music but it can also be used to _amplify_ them, that is,  to make them stronger and, hence, louder in the telephone receiver and  further its powers of amplification are so great that it will  reproduce them by means of a _loud speaker_, just as a horn amplifies  the sounds of a phonograph reproducer, until they can be heard by a  room or an auditorium full of people. There are two general types of  loud speakers, though both use the principle of the telephone  receiver. The construction of these loud speakers will be fully  described in a later chapter.    Assembled Vacuum Tube Receiving Sets.--You can buy a receiving set  with a vacuum tube detector from the very simplest type, which is  described in this chapter, to those that are provided with  _regenerative circuits_ and _amplifying_ tubes or both, which we shall  describe in later chapters, from dealers in electrical apparatus  generally. While one of these sets costs more than you can assemble a  set for yourself, still, especially in the beginning, it is a good  plan to buy an assembled one for it is fitted with a _panel_ on which  the adjusting knobs of the rheostat, tuning coil and condenser are  mounted and this makes it possible to operate it as soon as you get it  home and without the slightest trouble on your part.    You can, however, buy all the various parts separately and mount them  yourself. If you want the receptor simply for receiving then it is a  good scheme to have all of the parts mounted in a box or enclosed  case, but if you want it for experimental purposes then the parts  should be mounted on a base or a panel so that all of the connections  are in sight and accessible.    A Simple Vacuum Tube Receiving Set.--For this set you should use: (1)  a _loose coupled tuning coil,_ (2) a _variable condenser,_ (3) a  _vacuum tube detector,_ (4) an A or _storage battery_ giving 6 volts,  (5) a B or _dry cell battery_ giving 22-1/2 volts, (6) a _rheostat_  for varying the storage battery current, and (7) a pair of 2,000-ohm  _head telephone receivers_. The loose coupled tuning coil, the  variable condenser and the telephone receivers are the same as those  described in Chapter III.    The Vacuum Tube Detector. With Two Electrodes.--A vacuum tube in its  simplest form consists of a glass bulb like an incandescent lamp in  which a _wire filament_ and a _metal plate_ are sealed as shown in  Fig. 37, The air is then pumped out of the tube and a vacuum left or  after it is exhausted it is filled with nitrogen, which cannot burn.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Two Electrode Vacuum Tube Detectors.]    When the vacuum tube is used as a detector, the wire filament is  heated red-hot and the metal plate is charged with positive  electricity though it remains cold. The wire filament is formed into a  loop like that of an incandescent lamp and its outside ends are  connected with a 6-volt storage battery, which is called the A  battery; then the + or _positive_ terminal of a 22-1/2 volt dry cell  battery, called the B battery, is connected to the metal plate while  the - or _negative_ terminal of the battery is connected to one of the  terminals of the wire filament. The diagram, Fig. 37, simply shows how  the two electrode vacuum tube, the A or dry battery, and the B or  storage battery are connected up.    Three Electrode Vacuum Tube Detector.--The three electrode vacuum tube  detector shown at A in Fig. 38, is much more sensitive than the two  electrode tube and has, in consequence, all but supplanted it. In this  more recent type of vacuum tube the third electrode, or _grid_, as it  is called, is placed between the wire filament and the metal plate and  this allows the current to be increased or decreased at will to a very  considerable extent.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Three Electrode Vacuum Tube Detector and  Battery Connections.]    The way the three electrode vacuum tube detector is connected with the  batteries is shown at B. The plate, the A or dry cell battery and one  terminal of the filament are connected in _series_--that is, one after  the other, and the ends of the filament are connected to the B or  storage battery. In assembling a receiving set you must, of course,  have a socket for the vacuum tube. A vacuum tube detector costs from  $5.00 to $6.00.    The Dry Cell and Storage Batteries.--The reason that a storage battery  is used for heating the filament of the vacuum tube detector is  because the current delivered is constant, whereas when a dry cell  battery is used the current soon falls off and, hence, the heat of the  filament gradually grows less. The smallest A or 6 volt storage  battery on the market has a capacity of 20 to 40 ampere hours, weighs  13 pounds and costs about $10.00. It is shown at A in Fig. 39. The B  or dry cell battery for the vacuum tube plate circuit that gives  22-1/2 volts can be bought already assembled in sealed boxes. The  small size is fitted with a pair of terminals while the larger size is  provided with _taps_ so that the voltage required by the plate can be  adjusted as the proper operation of the tube requires careful  regulation of the plate voltage. A dry cell battery for a plate  circuit is shown at B.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--A and B Batteries for Vacuum  Tube Detectors.]    The Filament Rheostat.--An adjustable resistance, called a _rheostat_,  must be used in the filament and storage battery circuit so that the  current flowing through the filament can be controlled to a nicety.  The rheostat consists of an insulating and a heat resisting form on  which is wound a number of turns of resistance wire. A movable contact  arm that slides over and presses on the turns of wire is fixed to the  knob on top of the rheostat. A rheostat that has a resistance of 6  ohms and a current carrying capacity of 1.5 amperes which can be  mounted on a panel board is the right kind to use. It is shown at A  and B in Fig. 40 and costs $1.25.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Rheostat for the A or Storage Battery  Current.]    Assembling the Parts.--Begin by placing all of the separate parts of  the receiving set on a board or a base of other material and set the  tuning coil on the left hand side with the adjustable switch end  toward the right hand side so that you can reach it easily. Then set  the variable condenser in front of it, set the vacuum tube detector at  the right hand end of the tuning coil and the rheostat in front of the  detector. Place the two sets of batteries back of the instruments and  screw a couple of binding posts _a_ and _b_ to the right hand lower  edge of the base for connecting in the head phones all of which is  shown at A in Fig. 41.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 41.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for a Vacuum  Tube Detector Receiving Set.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 41.--Wiring Diagram of a Simple Vacuum Tube  Receiving Set.]    Connecting Up the Parts.--To wire up the different parts begin by  connecting the sliding contact of the primary coil of the loose  coupled tuning coil (this you will remember is the outside one that is  wound with fine wire) to the upper post of the lightning switch and  connect one terminal of this coil with the water pipe. Now connect the  free end of the secondary coil of the tuning coil (this is the inside  coil that is wound with heavy wire) to one of the binding posts of the  variable condenser and connect the movable contact arm of the  adjustable switch of the primary of the tuning coil with the other  post of the variable condenser.    Next connect the grid of the vacuum tube to one of the posts of the  condenser and then connect the plate of the tube to the _carbon  terminal_ of the B or dry cell battery which is the + or _positive  pole_ and connect the _zinc terminal_ of the - or _negative_ pole to  the binding post _a_, connect the post _b_ to the other side of the  variable condenser and then connect the terminals of the head phones  to the binding posts _a_ and _b_. Whatever you do be careful not to  get the plate connections of the battery reversed.    Now connect one of the posts of the rheostat to one terminal of the  filament and the other terminal of the filament to the - or _negative_  terminal of the A or storage battery and the + or _positive_ terminal  of the A or storage battery to the other post of the rheostat. Finally  connect the + or positive terminal of the A or storage battery with  the wire that runs from the head phones to the variable condenser, all  of which is shown in the wiring diagram at B in Fig. 41.    Adjusting the Vacuum Tube Detector Receiving Set.--A vacuum tube  detector is tuned exactly in the same way as the _Crystal Detector Set  No. 2_ described in Chapter III, in-so-far as the tuning coil and  variable condenser are concerned. The sensitivity of the vacuum tube  detector receiving set and, hence, the distance over which signals and  other sounds can be heard depends very largely on the sensitivity of  the vacuum tube itself and this in turn depends on: (1) the right  amount of heat developed by the filament, or _filament brilliancy_ as  it is called, (2) the right amount of voltage applied to the plate,  and (3) the extent to which the tube is exhausted where this kind of a  tube is used.    To vary the current flowing from the A or storage battery  through the filament so that it will be heated to the right degree you  adjust the rheostat while you are listening in to the signals or other  sounds. By carefully adjusting the rheostat you can easily find the  point at which it makes the tube the most sensitive. A rheostat is  also useful in that it keeps the filament from burning out when the  current from the battery first flows through it. You can very often  increase the sensitiveness of a vacuum tube after you have used it for  a while by recharging the A or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#15)"],[1," from a demi-mondaine, especially at Monte Carlo.  After chatting some  more I bid the courier good night.  I would see the Countess the first  thing in the morning.    Along toward noon I called at the Nouvel Hotel Louvre where von Wedel  had told me I would find Countess Chechany.  I sent in my own card  bearing the name of H. Van Huit, Doorn Kloof, Transvaal (the reader  will recall my experience at Doorn Kloof); also von Wedel's card with  his signature.    I had to wait for some time, but finally the Countess received me in  her boudoir.  She was in bewitching negligee.  From the photograph I  was prepared to find a very handsome woman, but shades of Helen!  This  was Venus, Juno and Minerva--the whole Greek and any other goddesses  rolled into one!  Tall and willowy, superb of figure, great dark-blue  eyes, masses of blue-black wavy hair, full red lips forming a perfect  Cupid's bow.  But why go on--I might get too enthusiastic, and mislead  the reader.  After my adventure I never saw the Countess again.    I knew that by birth the Colmtess Chechany was a high Hungarian  noblewoman.  By marriage she was related to the Counts of Tolna  Festetics, a leading house in Hungary.  Also, she was one of those  marvelously beautiful women peculiar to that country.  Waving a small  jeweled hand, she begged me to take a chair beside her.  A cigarette  was daintily poised in her fingers.    \"Be seated, Mr. Van Huit of Transvaal,\" gazing at me with a roguish  grin.    We both burst out laughing.  Of course she knew what I was.  Von  Wedel's card showed her that.  But, as her next words plainly showed,  she knew a great deal more.    \"I've got a badly sprained ankle, Doctor.  Can you do anything for  me?\"    I must have shown a pretty stupid face, for she laughed amusedly  again.  I certainly was surprised, for up to now I had never met her,  and my being a doctor was known only to one or two persons in the  Service.  Besides, it is strictly a rule of the Imperial Secret  Service never to discuss or divulge personal matters.  Her attitude by  no means pleased me.  I cordially hate anyone, especially women,  knowing more than I do.  One never knows where one is standing in a  case like this.  I decided not to show my curiosity, but I was  determined to learn how she knew about me.  Coolly I said:    \"Well, Countess, you have somewhat of an advantage.  But if I can be  of any assistance to you, pray command me.\"    As answer, she sprang up, and pirouetting around the room, exclaimed:    \"Now, why be peevish.  If you're good and nice, I shall tell you  sometime all about it.\"    She never did, for with all her ingenuous mannerisms, my lady was  about the deepest and least fathomable bit of femininity I have ever  met--besides being the possessor of a devil of a temper.  After some  more banter, which I instigated to become somewhat acquainted with my  prospective partner, I came to business.    \"Do you know, Countess, the object of my mission?\"    \"Nothing beyond the intimation of your coming and the command to  cooperate with you if necessary.  So you had better enlighten me, mon  chÃ¨re.\"    I did so with some reservation, it being my habit not to let anyone  into a thing too much, least of all a woman.  I suggested that our  first object was to make Prince Galitzin's acquaintance.  As his  Serene Highness resided at the Hotel de Londres, we agreed to dine  there.  After accepting a dainty cup of chocolate I departed,  purposely returning home by way of the Londres.  Here, with a little  diplomacy, I managed to reserve for dinner the table I wanted, one  next to the Prince.  Well pleased, I later dressed, armed myself with  a bouquet of La France roses, and called on my partner.    I had the roses sent up and waited.  The Countess sent word that she  would be down shortly.  I smoked three cigarettes.  Still no Countess.  I have yet to meet a woman who could or would be punctual.  Finally I  heard the soft swish and frou-frou of silk garments and looking up saw  her ladyship coming down the grand stairway.  She was brilliantly  robed, jewels flashed at her neck and wrists.  She was of that type of  beauty difficult to classify, although assured of approval in any  quarter of the world.    \"Tired of waiting, mon ami?\" tapping me playfully on the arm.  \"See,  in return for your patience I am wearing your roses.\"    She had them pinned on her corsage.  We entered our carriage and drove  to the Hotel de Londres, discussing the parts we were going to play.  Would the Russian Bear be caught?  I wondered.  When we arrived, I saw  that the hotel was pretty well filled.  Everybody who was anybody  seemed to be there.  I noticed a number of prominent American society  ladies.  Experience has taught me that there are three places where  you meet sooner or later every known person in the world,--Piccadilly  Circus, the terrace of Shephard's Hotel, Cairo, and Monte Carlo.    Remembering our diplomatic conversation of the afternoon, the maÃ®tre  d'hÃ´tel came rushing forward and with profound bows directed us to  our table, which was tastefully decorated with La France roses, the  Countess' favorites (charged to expenses).  As we walked slowly down  the passage to our table, many eyes were turned toward us.  The  Countess appeared unconscious of it all.  Lazily, half insolently  observant, yet wholly unconcerned, she was without doubt the most  strikingly beautiful woman in the assembly; this, though the society  of the world seemed to fill the Londres that night.  Poor Galitzin!    As we seated ourselves, a hush fell about the immediate table to our  right and left.  It was followed by a low buzzing of curious or  interested, wise or ignorant, human bees.  On our right I saw the  Prince Galitzin.  From the moment of our entrance he had kept looking  at the Countess.  I watched him out of the corner of my eye, and  abruptly he changed seats with one of the gentlemen at his table.  Obviously his view of the Countess' face was not at the angle he  wished.  Screwing his monocle in his eye, he began to stare pretty  consistently.    Of course this delighted me.  The avidity with which his Serene  Highness was swallowing the bait promised much.  I thought it  advisable, however, to create a little diversion, something that would  drive away a possible suspicion that this was a \"plant.\"  It was  perfectly obvious to all that the Prince was becoming fascinated.  Also, he was losing his head, for he was showing his fascination in a  rather rude manner.  His staring began to attract some attention.    That was the opportunity I was looking for.  Calling the maÃ®tre  d'hÃ´tel, I requested him, pitching my voice so that it would be  easily audible at the surrounding tables:    \"Persuade the gentleman on our right to discontinue his annoying  stare.\"    I saw that the Prince had heard my request.  Flushing deeply red, he  abruptly rose and with a bow to the Countess went out of the room.  It  was as I wished.    We finished our exquisite and excellently well-served dinner, and went  out to the Terrace Gardens to have our cafÃ© Turc and cigarettes.  This, to my mind, is the most enjoyable hour of the day, especially in  a place like Monte Carlo, well groomed, well fed, surrounded by an  ever-varying throng of interesting people, beautiful scenery,  exquisite music, the ideal _dolce far niente_.    Slowly inhaling the smoke of my excellent Medijeh, I fell into a sort  of contemplative reverie while waiting for the Prince.  I knew he  would come.  Back and forth in front of me wandered humanity, all  grades and shades.  Here a prince, scion of a noble house, there a  parvenu, fresh from his latest stock-jobbing victory.  Here a  mondaine, a demi-mondaine with a reputation in half a dozen countries.  Here a group of famous lights of the stage, there a couple of eminent  statesmen.  Truly, a cosmopolitan crowd.  What if the antecedents of  some of the pleasure seekers here were known?  I recognized many and  it being my business to know such things, their stories came back to  me magically.  Skeletons at the feast?  Oh, yes, grewsome ones, too.  Just as well, an all-wise Providence has ordained our inability to see  behind the veil.  I knew that the woman opposite me could no more  afford to lift her veil than I could mine.    Then one of the gentlemen from the Prince's table came up and  addressed me.  First, however, he handed me a card, which I saw bore  the name of Prince Kassimir Vladimir Galitzin.    \"Monsieur,\" said the Prince's companion, \"I'm deputed by the Prince to  convey his regrets, should he have caused Madame or you any annoyance.  The Prince begs permission to make his apology to Madame in person.\"    I replied in words to the effect that Madame being a free agent and  only an acquaintance of mine, must decide this for herself.    \"Personally,\" I added, \"I have no objection.\"    The Countess simply nodded.  The Prince's envoy bowed and went away.    He returned in a few minutes with the Prince.  Mutual introductions,  general chatting, the Prince confining himself exclusively to the  Countess.  About half an hour's talk, refreshments, and there came an  arrangement for luncheon the next day at which the Countess and myself  were invited to be the guests of the Prince.    The luncheon was duly gives at the Hotel Londres and the Prince was a  princely host.  Having been invited, I had to attend.  There was a  theater party that evening however, to which I was not invited, and  supper after, to which I was not invited.  Indeed, when I met the  Prince Galitzin on the grand promenade the next day, he gave me a very  princely stare and kept on walking.  All of which suited me perfectly  well.  He was in the hands of the Countess.    From afar I watched him become daily more infatuated.  They were  constantly driving and attending theaters together.  The Prince was  showering valuable presents right and left.  In the midst of this, I"]]]
