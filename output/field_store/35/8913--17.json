'Give  me but time to reduce to some semblance of order the innumerable errors  and complications with which I am confronted, and I shall gladly and  sincerely join with the aged Israelite in the canticle which too many, I  fear, pronounce but with their lips.' This reflection I find, not in a  diary, but a letter; the doctor's friends seem to have returned his  correspondence to his surviving sister. He does not confine himself,  however, to reflections. His investigation of the rights and duties of  his office are very searching and business-like, and there is a  calculation in one place that a period of three years will just suffice  to set the business of the Archdeaconry upon a proper footing. The  estimate appears to have been an exact one. For just three years he is  occupied in reforms; but I look in vain at the end of that time for the  promised _Nunc dimittis_. He has now found a new sphere of activity.  Hitherto his duties have precluded him from more than an occasional  attendance at the Cathedral services. Now he begins to take an interest  in the fabric and the music. Upon his struggles with the organist, an old  gentleman who had been in office since 1786, I have no time to dwell;  they were not attended with any marked success. More to the purpose is  his sudden growth of enthusiasm for the Cathedral itself and its  furniture. There is a draft of a letter to Sylvanus Urban (which I do not  think was ever sent) describing the stalls in the choir. As I have said,  these were of fairly late date--of about the year 1700, in fact.    'The archdeacon's stall, situated at the south-east end, west of the  episcopal throne (now so worthily occupied by the truly excellent prelate  who adorns the See of Barchester), is distinguished by some curious  ornamentation. In addition to the arms of Dean West, by whose efforts the  whole of the internal furniture of the choir was completed, the  prayer-desk is terminated at the eastern extremity by three small but  remarkable statuettes in the grotesque manner. One is an exquisitely  modelled figure of a cat, whose crouching posture suggests with admirable  spirit the suppleness, vigilance, and craft of the redoubted adversary of  the genus _Mus_. Opposite to this is a figure seated upon a throne and  invested with the attributes of royalty; but it is no earthly monarch  whom the carver has sought to portray. His feet are studiously concealed  by the long robe in which he is draped: but neither the crown nor the cap  which he wears suffice to hide the prick-ears and curving horns which  betray his Tartarean origin; and the hand which rests upon his knee is  armed with talons of horrifying length and sharpness. Between these two  figures stands a shape muffled in a long mantle. This might at first  sight be mistaken for a monk or \"friar of orders gray\", for the head is  cowled and a knotted cord depends from somewhere about the waist. A  slight inspection, however, will lead to a very different conclusion. The  knotted cord is quickly seen to be a halter, held by a hand all but  concealed within the draperies; while the sunken features and, horrid to  relate, the rent flesh upon the cheek-bones, proclaim the King of  Terrors. These figures are evidently the production of no unskilled  chisel; and should it chance that any of your correspondents are able to  throw light upon their origin and significance, my obligations to your  valuable miscellany will be largely increased.'    There is more description in the paper, and, seeing that the woodwork in  question has now disappeared, it has a considerable interest. A paragraph  at the end is worth quoting:    'Some late researches among the Chapter accounts have shown me that the  carving of the stalls was not, as was very usually reported, the work of  Dutch artists, but was executed by a native of this city or district  named Austin. The timber was procured from an oak copse in the vicinity,  the property of the Dean and Chapter, known as Holywood. Upon a recent  visit to the parish within whose boundaries it is situated, I learned  from the aged and truly respectable incumbent that traditions still  lingered amongst the inhabitants of the great size and age of the oaks  employed to furnish the materials of the stately structure which has  been, however imperfectly, described in the above lines. Of one in  particular, which stood near the centre of the grove, it is remembered  that it was known as the Hanging Oak. The propriety of that title is  confirmed by the fact that a quantity of human bones was found in the  soil about its roots, and that at certain times of the year it was the  custom for those who wished to secure a successful issue to their  affairs, whether of love or the ordinary business of life, to suspend  from its boughs small images or puppets rudely fashioned of straw, twigs,  or the like rustic materials.'    So much for the archdeacon's archaeological investigations. To return to  his career as it is to be gathered from his diaries. Those of his first  three years of hard and careful work show him throughout in high spirits,  and, doubtless, during this time, that reputation for hospitality and  urbanity which is mentioned in his obituary notice was well deserved.  After that, as time goes on, I see a shadow coming over him--destined to  develop into utter blackness--which I cannot but think must have been  reflected in his outward demeanour. He commits a good deal of his fears  and troubles to his diary; there was no other outlet for them. He was  unmarried and his sister was not always with him. But I am much mistaken  if he has told all that he might have told. A series of extracts shall be  given:        _Aug. 30th 1816_--The days begin to draw in more perceptibly than      ever. Now that the Archdeaconry papers are reduced to order, I must      find some further employment for the evening hours of autumn and      winter. It is a great blow that Letitia's health will not allow her      to stay through these months. Why not go on with my _Defence of      Episcopacy_? It may be useful.        _Sept. 15._--Letitia has left me for Brighton.        _Oct. 11._--Candles lit in the choir for the first time at evening      prayers. It came as a shock: I find that I absolutely shrink from the      dark season.        _Nov. 17_--Much struck by the character of the carving on my desk: I      do not know that I had ever carefully noticed it before. My attention      was called to it by an accident. During the _Magnificat_ I was, I      regret to say, almost overcome with sleep. My hand was resting on the      back of the carved figure of a cat which is the nearest to me of the      three figures on the end of my stall. I was not aware of this, for I      was not looking in that direction, until I was startled by what      seemed a softness, a feeling as of rather rough and coarse fur, and a      sudden movement, as if the creature were twisting round its head to      bite me. I regained complete consciousness in an instant, and I have      some idea that I must have uttered a suppressed exclamation, for I      noticed that Mr Treasurer turned his head quickly in my direction.      The impression of the unpleasant feeling was so strong that I found      myself rubbing my hand upon my surplice. This accident led me to      examine the figures after prayers more carefully than I had done      before, and I realized for the first time with what skill they are      executed.        _Dec. 6_--I do indeed miss Letitia's company. The evenings, after I      have worked as long as I can at my _Defence_, are very trying. The      house is too large for a lonely man, and visitors of any kind are too      rare. I get an uncomfortable impression when going to my room that      there _is_ company of some kind. The fact is (I may as well formulate      it to myself) that I hear voices. This, I am well aware, is a common      symptom of incipient decay of the brain--and I believe that I should      be less disquieted than I am if I had any suspicion that this was the      cause. I have none--none whatever, nor is there anything in my family      history to give colour to such an idea. Work, diligent work, and a      punctual attention to the duties which fall to me is my best remedy,      and I have little doubt that it will prove efficacious.        _Jan. 1_--My trouble is, I must confess it, increasing upon me. Last      night, upon my return after midnight from the Deanery, I lit my      candle to go upstairs. I was nearly at the top when something      whispered to me, 'Let me wish you a happy New Year.' I could not be      mistaken: it spoke distinctly and with a peculiar emphasis. Had I      dropped my candle, as I all but did, I tremble to think what the      consequences must have been. As it was, I managed to get up the last      flight, and was quickly in my room with the door locked, and      experienced no other disturbance.        _Jan. 15_--I had occasion to come downstairs last night to my      workroom for my watch, which I had inadvertently left on my table      when I went up to bed. I think I was at the top of the last flight      when I had a sudden impression of a sharp whisper in my ear '_Take      care_.' I clutched the balusters and naturally looked round at once.      Of course, there was nothing. After a moment I went on--it was no      good turning back--but I had as nearly as possible fallen: a cat--a      large one by the feel of it--slipped between my feet, but again, of      course, I saw nothing. It _may_ have been the kitchen cat, but I do      not think it was.        _Feb. 27_--A curious thing last night, which I should like to forget.      Perhaps if I put it down here I may see it in its true proportion. I      worked in the library from about 9 to 10. The hall and staircase      seemed to be unusually full of what I can only call movement without  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#15)"],[1," a tall, stout man--\"seest thou what that vile knave  Reynold Greenleaf hath done? He hath broken in upon our master's goods,  and hath smitten me a buffet upon the ear, so that I thought I was dead.  Good Cook, I love thee well, and thou shalt have a good pottle of our  master's best wine every day, for thou art an old and faithful servant.  Also, good Cook, I have ten shillings that I mean to give as a gift  to thee. But hatest thou not to see a vile upstart like this Reynold  Greenleaf taking it upon him so bravely?\"    \"Ay, marry, that do I,\" quoth the Cook boldly, for he liked the Steward  because of his talk of the wine and of the ten shillings. \"Get thee gone  straightway to thy room, and I will bring out this knave by his ears.\"  So saying, he laid aside his spit and drew the sword that hung by his  side; whereupon the Steward left as quickly as he could, for he hated  the sight of naked steel.    Then the Cook walked straightway to the broken pantry door, through  which he saw Little John tucking a napkin beneath his chin and preparing  to make himself merry.    \"Why, how now, Reynold Greenleaf?\" said the Cook, \"thou art no better  than a thief, I wot. Come thou straight forth, man, or I will carve thee  as I would carve a sucking pig.\"    \"Nay, good Cook, bear thou thyself more seemingly, or else I will come  forth to thy dole. At most times I am as a yearling lamb, but when one  cometh between me and my meat, I am a raging lion, as it were.\"    \"Lion or no lion,\" quoth the valorous Cook, \"come thou straight forth,  else thou art a coward heart as well as a knavish thief.\"    \"Ha!\" cried Little John, \"coward's name have I never had; so, look to  thyself, good Cook, for I come forth straight, the roaring lion I did  speak of but now.\"    Then he, too, drew his sword and came out of the pantry; then, putting  themselves into position, they came slowly together, with grim and angry  looks; but suddenly Little John lowered his point. \"Hold, good Cook!\"  said he. \"Now, I bethink me it were ill of us to fight with good  victuals standing so nigh, and such a feast as would befit two stout  fellows such as we are. Marry, good friend, I think we should enjoy this  fair feast ere we fight. What sayest thou, jolly Cook?\"    At this speech the Cook looked up and down, scratching his head in  doubt, for he loved good feasting. At last he drew a long breath and  said to Little John, \"Well, good friend, I like thy plan right well; so,  pretty boy, say I, let us feast, with all my heart, for one of us may  sup in Paradise before nightfall.\"    So each thrust his sword back into the scabbard and entered the pantry.  Then, after they had seated themselves, Little John drew his dagger and  thrust it into the pie. \"A hungry man must be fed,\" quoth he, \"so,  sweet chuck, I help myself without leave.\" But the Cook did not lag far  behind, for straightway his hands also were deeply thrust within the  goodly pasty. After this, neither of them spoke further, but used their  teeth to better purpose. But though neither spoke, they looked at one  another, each thinking within himself that he had never seen a more  lusty fellow than the one across the board.    At last, after a long time had passed, the Cook drew a full, deep  breath, as though of much regret, and wiped his hands upon the napkin,  for he could eat no more. Little John, also, had enough, for he pushed  the pasty aside, as though he would say, \"I want thee by me no more,  good friend.\" Then he took the pottle of sack, and said he, \"Now,  good fellow, I swear by all that is bright, that thou art the stoutest  companion at eating that ever I had. Lo! I drink thy health.\" So saying,  he clapped the flask to his lips and cast his eyes aloft, while the good  wine flooded his throat. Then he passed the pottle to the Cook, who also  said, \"Lo, I drink thy health, sweet fellow!\" Nor was he behind Little  John in drinking any more than in eating.    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"thy voice is right round and sweet, jolly  lad. I doubt not thou canst sing a ballad most blithely; canst thou  not?\"    \"Truly, I have trolled one now and then,\" quoth the Cook, \"yet I would  not sing alone.\"    \"Nay, truly,\" said Little John, \"that were but ill courtesy. Strike up  thy ditty, and I will afterward sing one to match it, if I can.    \"So be it, pretty boy,\" quoth the Cook. \"And hast thou e'er heard the  song of the Deserted Shepherdess?\"    \"Truly, I know not,\" answered Little John, \"but sing thou and let me  hear.\"    Then the Cook took another draught from the pottle, and, clearing his  throat, sang right sweetly:      THE SONG OF THE DESERTED SHEPHERDESS         \"_In Lententime, when leaves wax green,       And pretty birds begin to mate,       When lark cloth sing, and thrush, I ween,       And stockdove cooeth soon and late,       Fair Phillis sat beside a stone,       And thus I heard her make her moan:       'O willow, willow, willow, willow!       I'll take me of thy branches fair       And twine a wreath to deck my hair.         \"'The thrush hath taken him a she,       The robin, too, and eke the dove;       My Robin hath deserted me,       And left me for another love.       So here, by brookside, all alone,       I sit me down and make my moan.       O willow, willow, willow, willow!       I'll take me of thy branches fair       And twine a wreath to deck my hair.'         \"But ne'er came herring from the sea,       But good as he were in the tide;       Young Corydon came o'er the lea,       And sat him Phillis down beside.       So, presently, she changed her tone,       And 'gan to cease her from her moan,       'O willow, willow, willow, willow!       Thou mayst e'en keep thy garlands fair,       I want them not to deck my hair_.'\"    \"Now, by my faith,\" cried Little John, \"that same is a right good song,  and hath truth in it, also.\"    \"Glad am I thou likest it, sweet lad,\" said the Cook. \"Now sing thou one  also, for ne'er should a man be merry alone, or sing and list not.\"    \"Then I will sing thee a song of a right good knight of Arthur's court,  and how he cured his heart's wound without running upon the dart again,  as did thy Phillis; for I wot she did but cure one smart by giving  herself another. So, list thou while I sing:\"      THE GOOD KNIGHT AND HIS LOVE         \"_When Arthur, King, did rule this land,       A goodly king was he,       And had he of stout knights a band       Of merry company.         \"Among them all, both great and small,       A good stout knight was there,       A lusty childe, and eke a tall,       That loved a lady fair.         \"But nought would she to do with he,       But turned her face away;       So gat he gone to far countrye,       And left that lady gay.         \"There all alone he made his moan,       And eke did sob and sigh,       And weep till it would move a stone,       And he was like to die.         \"But still his heart did feel the smart,       And eke the dire distress,       And rather grew his pain more sharp       As grew his body less.         \"Then gat he back where was good sack       And merry com panye,       And soon did cease to cry 'Alack!'       When blithe and gay was he.         \"From which I hold, and feel full bold       To say, and eke believe,       That gin the belly go not cold       The heart will cease to grieve_.\"    \"Now, by my faith,\" cried the Cook, as he rattled the pottle against  the sideboard, \"I like that same song hugely, and eke the motive of it,  which lieth like a sweet kernel in a hazelnut.\"    \"Now thou art a man of shrewd opinions,\" quoth Little John, \"and I love  thee truly as thou wert my brother.\"    \"And I love thee, too. But the day draweth on, and I have my cooking to  do ere our master cometh home; so let us e'en go and settle this brave  fight we have in hand.\"    \"Ay, marry,\" quoth Little John, \"and that right speedily. Never have I  been more laggard in fighting than in eating and drinking. So come thou  straight forth into the passageway, where there is good room to swing a  sword, and I will try to serve thee.\"    Then they both stepped forth into the broad passage that led to the  Steward's pantry, where each man drew his sword again and without more  ado fell upon the other as though he would hew his fellow limb from  limb. Then their swords clashed upon one another with great din, and  sparks flew from each blow in showers. So they fought up and down the  hall for an hour and more, neither striking the other a blow, though  they strove their best to do so; for both were skillful at the fence;  so nothing came of all their labor. Ever and anon they rested, panting;  then, after getting their wind, at it they would go again more fiercely  than ever. At last Little John cried aloud, \"Hold, good Cook!\" whereupon  each rested upon his sword, panting.    \"Now will I make my vow,\" quoth Little John, \"thou art the very best  swordsman that ever mine eyes beheld. Truly, I had thought to carve thee  ere now.\"    \"And I had thought to do the same by thee,\" quoth the Cook, \"but I have  missed the mark somehow.\"    \"Now I have been thinking within myself,\" quoth Little John, \"what we  are fighting for; but albeit I do not rightly know.\"    \"Why, no more do I,\" said the Cook. \"I bear no love for that pursy  Steward, but I thought that we had engaged to fight with one another and  that it must be done.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"it doth seem to me that instead of striving  to cut one another's throats, it were better for us to be boon  companions. What sayst thou, jolly Cook, wilt thou go with me to  Sherwood Forest and join with Robin Hood's band? Thou shalt live a merry  life within the woodlands, and sevenscore good companions shalt thou  have, one of whom is mine own self. Thou shalt have three suits of  Lincoln green each year, and forty marks in pay.\"    \"Now, thou art a man after mine own heart!\" cried the Cook right  heartily, \"and, as thou speakest of it, that is"]]]
