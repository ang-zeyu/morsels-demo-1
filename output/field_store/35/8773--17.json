The mellow afternoon  and the good smell of salt and heather got rid of the dregs of my  queasiness, and I spent a profitable hour on the pier-head with a  guide-book called _Baddely's Scotland_, and one of Bartholomew's maps.  I was beginning to think that Amos might be able to tell me something,  for a talk with the captain had suggested that the _Tobermory_ would  not dally long in the neighbourhood of Rum and Eigg. The big droving  season was scarcely on yet, and sheep for the Oban market would be  lifted on the return journey. In that case Skye was the first place to  watch, and if I could get wind of any big cargo waiting there I would  be able to make a plan. Amos was somewhere near the Kyle, and that was  across the narrows from Skye. Looking at the map, it seemed to me that,  in spite of being passportless, I might be able somehow to make my way  up through Morvern and Arisaig to the latitude of Skye. The difficulty  would be to get across the strip of sea, but there must be boats to  beg, borrow or steal.    I was poring over Baddely when Gresson sat down beside me. He was in a  good temper, and disposed to talk, and to my surprise his talk was all  about the beauties of the countryside. There was a kind of apple-green  light over everything; the steep heather hills cut into the sky like  purple amethysts, while beyond the straits the western ocean stretched  its pale molten gold to the sunset. Gresson waxed lyrical over the  scene. 'This just about puts me right inside, Mr Brand. I've got to get  away from that little old town pretty frequent or I begin to moult like  a canary. A man feels a man when he gets to a place that smells as good  as this. Why in hell do we ever get messed up in those stone and lime  cages? I reckon some day I'll pull my freight for a clean location and  settle down there and make little poems. This place would about content  me. And there's a spot out in California in the Coast ranges that I've  been keeping my eye on,' The odd thing was that I believe he meant it.  His ugly face was lit up with a serious delight.    He told me he had taken this voyage before, so I got out Baddely and  asked for advice. 'I can't spend too much time on holidaying,' I told  him, 'and I want to see all the beauty spots. But the best of them seem  to be in the area that this fool British Government won't let you into  without a passport. I suppose I shall have to leave you at Oban.'    'Too bad,' he said sympathetically. 'Well, they tell me there's some  pretty sights round Oban.' And he thumbed the guide-book and began to  read about Glencoe.    I said that was not my purpose, and pitched him a yarn about Prince  Charlie and how my mother's great-grandfather had played some kind of  part in that show. I told him I wanted to see the place where the  Prince landed and where he left for France. 'So far as I can make out  that won't take me into the passport country, but I'll have to do a bit  of footslogging. Well, I'm used to padding the hoof. I must get the  captain to put me off in Morvern, and then I can foot it round the top  of Lochiel and get back to Oban through Appin. How's that for a holiday  trek?'    He gave the scheme his approval. 'But if it was me, Mr Brand, I would  have a shot at puzzling your gallant policemen. You and I don't take  much stock in Governments and their two-cent laws, and it would be a  good game to see just how far you could get into the forbidden land. A  man like you could put up a good bluff on those hayseeds. I don't mind  having a bet ...'    'No,' I said. 'I'm out for a rest, and not for sport. If there was  anything to be gained I'd undertake to bluff my way to the Orkney  Islands. But it's a wearing job and I've better things to think about.'    'So? Well, enjoy yourself your own way. I'll be sorry when you leave  us, for I owe you something for that rough-house, and beside there's  darned little company in the old moss-back captain.'    That evening Gresson and I swopped yarns after supper to the  accompaniment of the 'Ma Goad!' and 'Is't possible?' of captain and  mate. I went to bed after a glass or two of weak grog, and made up for  the last night's vigil by falling sound asleep. I had very little kit  with me, beyond what I stood up in and could carry in my waterproof  pockets, but on Amos's advice I had brought my little nickel-plated  revolver. This lived by day in my hip pocket, but at night I put it  behind my pillow. But when I woke next morning to find us casting  anchor in the bay below rough low hills, which I knew to be the island  of Colonsay, I could find no trace of the revolver. I searched every  inch of the bunk and only shook out feathers from the mouldy ticking. I  remembered perfectly putting the thing behind my head before I went to  sleep, and now it had vanished utterly. Of course I could not advertise  my loss, and I didn't greatly mind it, for this was not a job where I  could do much shooting. But it made me think a good deal about Mr  Gresson. He simply could not suspect me; if he had bagged my gun, as I  was pretty certain he had, it must be because he wanted it for himself  and not that he might disarm me. Every way I argued it I reached the  same conclusion. In Gresson's eyes I must seem as harmless as a child.    We spent the better part of a day at Colonsay, and Gresson, so far as  his duties allowed, stuck to me like a limpet. Before I went ashore I  wrote out a telegram for Amos. I devoted a hectic hour to the  _Pilgrim's Progress_, but I could not compose any kind of intelligible  message with reference to its text. We had all the same edition--the  one in the _Golden Treasury_ series--so I could have made up a sort of  cipher by referring to lines and pages, but that would have taken up a  dozen telegraph forms and seemed to me too elaborate for the purpose.  So I sent this message:       _Ochterlony, Post Office, Kyle,     I hope to spend part of holiday near you and to see you if boat's     programme permits. Are any good cargoes waiting in your     neighbourhood? Reply Post Office, Oban._    It was highly important that Gresson should not see this, but it was  the deuce of a business to shake him off. I went for a walk in the  afternoon along the shore and passed the telegraph office, but the  confounded fellow was with me all the time. My only chance was just  before we sailed, when he had to go on board to check some cargo. As  the telegraph office stood full in view of the ship's deck I did not go  near it. But in the back end of the clachan I found the schoolmaster,  and got him to promise to send the wire. I also bought off him a couple  of well-worn sevenpenny novels.    The result was that I delayed our departure for ten minutes and when I  came on board faced a wrathful Gresson. 'Where the hell have you been?'  he asked. 'The weather's blowing up dirty and the old man's mad to get  off. Didn't you get your legs stretched enough this afternoon?'    I explained humbly that I had been to the schoolmaster to get something  to read, and produced my dingy red volumes. At that his brow cleared. I  could see that his suspicions were set at rest.    We left Colonsay about six in the evening with the sky behind us  banking for a storm, and the hills of Jura to starboard an angry  purple. Colonsay was too low an island to be any kind of breakwater  against a western gale, so the weather was bad from the start. Our  course was north by east, and when we had passed the butt-end of the  island we nosed about in the trough of big seas, shipping tons of water  and rolling like a buffalo. I know as much about boats as about  Egyptian hieroglyphics, but even my landsman's eyes could tell that we  were in for a rough night. I was determined not to get queasy again,  but when I went below the smell of tripe and onions promised to be my  undoing; so I dined off a slab of chocolate and a cabin biscuit, put on  my waterproof, and resolved to stick it out on deck.    I took up position near the bows, where I was out of reach of the oily  steamer smells. It was as fresh as the top of a mountain, but mighty  cold and wet, for a gusty drizzle had set in, and I got the spindrift  of the big waves. There I balanced myself, as we lurched into the  twilight, hanging on with one hand to a rope which descended from the  stumpy mast. I noticed that there was only an indifferent rail between  me and the edge, but that interested me and helped to keep off  sickness. I swung to the movement of the vessel, and though I was  mortally cold it was rather pleasant than otherwise. My notion was to  get the nausea whipped out of me by the weather, and, when I was  properly tired, to go down and turn in.    I stood there till the dark had fallen. By that time I was an  automaton, the way a man gets on sentry-go, and I could have easily  hung on till morning. My thoughts ranged about the earth, beginning  with the business I had set out on, and presently--by way of  recollections of Blenkiron and Peter--reaching the German forest where,  in the Christmas of 1915, I had been nearly done in by fever and old  Stumm. I remembered the bitter cold of that wild race, and the way the  snow seemed to burn like fire when I stumbled and got my face into it.  I reflected that sea-sickness was kitten's play to a good bout of  malaria.    The weather was growing worse, and I was getting more than spindrift  from the seas. I hooked my arm round the rope, for my fingers were  numbing. Then I fell to dreaming again, principally about Fosse Manor  and Mary Lamington. This so ravished me that I was as good as asleep. I  was trying to reconstruct the picture as I had last seen her at  Biggleswick station ...    A heavy body collided with me and shook my arm from the rope. I  slithered across the yard of deck, engulfed in a whirl of water. One  foot caught a stanchion of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5605"],[0,"The Power of Movement in Plants (#15)"],[1,"of  cotyledons to light and consequent disturbance of their periodic movements-  -Sensitiveness of cotyledons to contact.

DITTO  [page 69]    Radicles.--In all the germinating seeds observed by us, the first change is  the protrusion of the radicle, which immediately bends downwards and  endeavours to penetrate the ground. In order to effect this, it is almost  necessary that the seed should be pressed down so as to offer some  resistance, unless indeed the soil is extremely loose; for otherwise the  seed is lifted up, instead of the radicle penetrating the surface. But  seeds often get covered by earth thrown up by burrowing quadrupeds or  scratching birds, by the castings of earth-worms, by heaps of excrement,  the decaying branches of trees, etc., and will thus be pressed down; and  they must often fall into cracks when the ground is dry, or into holes.  Even with seeds lying on the bare surface, the first developed root-hairs,  by becoming attached to stones or other objects on the surface, are able to  hold down the upper part of the radicle, whilst the tip penetrates the  ground. Sachs has shown* how well and closely root-hairs adapt themselves  by growth to the most irregular particles in the soil, and become firmly  attached to them. This attachment seems to be effected by the softening or  liquefaction of the outer surface of the wall of the hair and its  subsequent consolidation, as will be on some future occasion more fully  described. This intimate union plays an important part, according to Sachs,  in the absorption of water and of the inorganic matter dissolved in it. The  mechanical aid afforded by the root-hairs in penetrating the ground is  probably only a secondary service.    The tip of the radicle, as soon as it protrudes from the seed-coats, begins  to circumnutate, and the whole    * 'Physiologie Végétale,' 1868, pp. 199, 205.  [page 70]    growing part continues to do so, probably for as long as growth continues.  This movement of the radicle has been described in Brassica, Aesculus,  Phaseolus, Vicia, Cucurbita, Quercus and Zea. The probability of its  occurrence was inferred by Sachs,* from radicles placed vertically upwards  being acted on by geotropism (which we likewise found to be the case), for  if they had remained absolutely perpendicular, the attraction of gravity  could not have caused them to bend to any one side. Circumnutation was  observed in the above specified cases, either by means of extremely fine  filaments of glass affixed to the radicles in the manner previously  described, or by their being allowed to grow downwards over inclined smoked  glass-plates, on which they left their tracks. In the latter cases the  serpentine course (see Figs. 19, 21, 27, 41) showed unequivocally that the  apex had continually moved from side to side. This lateral movement was  small in extent, being in the case of Phaseolus at most about 1 mm. from a  medial line to both sides. But there was also movement in a vertical plane  at right angles to the inclined glass-plates. This was shown by the tracks  often being alternately a little broader and narrower, due to the radicles  having alternately pressed with greater and less force on the plates.  Occasionally little bridges of soot were left across the tracks, showing  that the apex had at these spots been lifted up. This latter fact was  especially apt to occur  * 'Ueber das Wachsthum der Wurzeln: Arbeiten des bot. Instituts in  Würzburg,' Heft iii. 1873, p. 460. This memoir, besides its intrinsic and  great interest, deserves to be studied as a model of careful investigation,  and we shall have occasion to refer to it repeatedly. Dr. Frank had  previously remarked ('Beiträge zur Pflanzenphysiologie, 1868, p. 81) on the  fact of radicles placed vertically upwards being acted on by geotropism,  and he explained it by the supposition that their growth was not equal on  all sides.    [page 71]  when the radicle instead of travelling straight down the glass made a  semicircular bend; but Fig. 52 shows that this may occur when the track is  rectilinear. The apex by thus rising, was in one instance able to surmount  a bristle cemented across an inclined glass-plate; but slips of wood only  1/40 of an inch in thickness always caused the radicles to bend  rectangularly to one side, so that the apex did not rise to this small  height in opposition to geotropism.    In those cases in which radicles with attached filaments were placed so as  to stand up almost vertically, they curved downwards through the action of  geotropism, circumnutating at the same time, and their courses were  consequently zigzag. Sometimes, however, they made great circular sweeps,  the lines being likewise zigzag.    Radicles closely surrounded by earth, even when this is thoroughly soaked  and softened, may perhaps be quite prevented from circumnutating. Yet we  should remember that the circumnutating sheath-like cotyledons of Phalaris,  the hypocotyls of Solanum, and the epicotyls of Asparagus formed round  themselves little circular cracks or furrows in a superficial layer of damp  argillaceous sand. They were also able, as well as the hypocotyls of  Brassica, to form straight furrows in damp sand, whilst circumnutating and  bending towards a lateral light. In a future chapter it will be shown that  the rocking or circumnutating movement of the flower-heads of Trifolium  subterraneum aids them in burying themselves. It is therefore probable that  the circumnutation of the tip of the radicle aids it slightly in  penetrating the ground; and it may be observed in several of the previously  given diagrams, that the movement is more strongly pronounced in radicles  when they first  [page 72]  protrude from the seed than at a rather later period; but whether this is  an accidental or an adaptive coincidence we do not pretend to decide.  Nevertheless, when young radicles of Phaseolus multiflorus were fixed  vertically close over damp sand, in the expectation that as soon as they  reached it they would form circular furrows, this did not occur,--a fact  which may be accounted for, as we believe, by the furrow being filled up as  soon as formed by the rapid increase of thickness in the apex of the  radicle. Whether or not a radicle, when surrounded by softened earth, is  aided in forming a passage for itself by circumnutating, this movement can  hardly fail to be of high importance, by guiding the radicle along a line  of least resistance, as will be seen in the next chapter when we treat of  the sensibility of the tip to contact. If, however, a radicle in its  downward growth breaks obliquely into any crevice, or a hole left by a  decayed root, or one made by the larva of an insect, and more especially by  worms, the circumnutating movement of the tip will materially aid it in  following such open passage; and we have observed that roots commonly run  down the old burrows of worms.*     When a radicle is placed in a horizontal or inclined position, the  terminal growing part, as is well known, bends down towards the centre of  the earth; and Sachs* has shown that whilst thus bending, the growth of the  lower surface is greatly retarded, whilst that    * See, also, Prof. Hensen's statements ('Zeitschrift für Wissen, Zool.,' B.  xxviii. p. 354, 1877) to the same effect.
