[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#16)"],[1,"night, we will walk out along the cliff to Worth, and take a  look at a cottage there that Damen spoke about, with a walled orchard at  the back, and fuchsia hedge in front--'tis near the Lobster Inn, and has  a fine prospect of the sea; and if we live there, we will leave the vault  alone awhile and use this Pyegrove's Hole for storehouse, till the watch  is relaxed.'    I did not answer, having my thoughts on other things, and he tossed off  his liquor, saying, 'Thou'rt tired; so let's to bed, for we shall get  little sleep tomorrow night.'    It was true that I was tired, and yet I could not get to sleep, but  tossed and turned in my bed for thinking of many things, and being vexed  that we were to leave Moonfleet. Yet mine was a selfish sorrow; for I had  little thought for Elzevir and the pain that it must be to him to quit,  the Why Not?: nor yet was it the grief of leaving Moonfleet that so  troubled me, although that was the only place I ever had known, and  seemed to me then--as now--the only spot on earth fit to be lived in; but  the real care and canker was that I was going away from Grace Maskew. For  since she had left school I had grown fonder of her; and now that it was  difficult to see her, I took the more pains to accomplish it, and met her  sometimes in Manor Woods, and more than once, when Maskew was away, had  walked with her on Weatherbeech Hill. So we bred up a boy-and-girl  affection, and must needs pledge ourselves to be true to one another, not  knowing what such silly words might mean. And I told Grace all my  secrets, not even excepting the doings of the contraband, and the Mohune  vault and Blackbeard's locket, for I knew all was as safe with her as  with me, and that her father could never rack aught from her. Nay, more,  her bedroom was at the top of the gabled wing of the Manor House, and  looked right out to sea; and one clear night, when our boat was coming  late from fishing, I saw her candle burning there, and next day told her  of it. And then she said that she would set a candle to burn before the  panes on winter nights, and be a leading light for boats at sea. And so  she did, and others beside me saw and used it, calling it 'Maskew's  Match', and saying that it was the attorney sitting up all night to pore  over ledgers and add up his fortune.    So this night as I lay awake I vexed and vexed myself for thinking of  her, and at last resolved to go up next morning to the Manor Woods and  lie in wait for Grace, to tell her what was up, and that we were going  away to Worth.    Next day, the 16th of April--a day I have had cause to remember all my  life--I played truant from Mr. Glennie, and by ten in the forenoon found  myself in the woods.    There was a little dimple on the hillside above the house, green with  burdocks in summer and filled with dry leaves in winter--just big enough  to hold one lying flat, and not so deep but that I could look over the  lip of it and see the house without being seen. Thither I went that day,  and lay down in the dry leaves to wait and watch for Grace.    The morning was bright enough. The chills of the night before had given  way to sunlight that seemed warm as summer, and yet had with it the soft  freshness of spring. There was scarce a breath moving in the wood, though  I could see the clouds of white dust stalking up the road that climbs  Ridge down, and the trees were green with buds, yet without leafage to  keep the sunbeams from lighting up the ground below, which glowed with  yellow king-cups. So I lay there for a long, long while; and to make time  pass quicker, took from my bosom the silver locket, and opening it, read  again the parchment, which I had read times out of mind before, and knew  indeed by heart.    'The days of our age are threescore years and ten', and the rest.    Now, whenever I handled the locket, my thoughts were turned to Mohune's  treasure; and it was natural that it should be so, for the locket  reminded me of my first journey to the vault; and I laughed at myself,  remembering how simple I had been, and had hoped to find the place  littered with diamonds, and to see the gold lying packed in heaps. And  thus for the hundredth time I came to rack my brain to know where the  diamond could be hid, and thought at last it must be buried in the  churchyard, because of the talk of Blackbeard being seen on wild nights  digging there for his treasure. But then, I reasoned, that very like it  was the contrabandiers whom men had seen with spades when they were  digging out the passage from the tomb to the vault, and set them down for  ghosts because they wrought at night. And while I was busy with such  thoughts, the door opened in the house below me, and out came Grace with  a hood on her head and a basket for wild flowers in her hand.    I watched to see which way she would walk; and as soon as she took the  path that leads up Weatherbeech, made off through the dry brushwood to  meet her, for we had settled she should never go that road except when  Maskew was away. So there we met and spent an hour together on the hill,  though I shall not write here what we said, because it was mostly silly  stuff. She spoke much of the auction and of Elzevir leaving the Why Not?,  and though she never said a word against her father, let me know what  pain his doing gave her. But most she grieved that we were leaving  Moonfleet, and showed her grief in such pretty ways, as made me almost  glad to see her sorry. And from her I learned that Maskew was indeed  absent from home, having been called away suddenly last night. The  evening was so fine, he said (and this surprised me, remembering how dark  and cold it was with us), that he must needs walk round the policies; but  about nine o'clock came back and told her he had got a sudden call to  business, which would take him to Weymouth then and there. So to saddle,  and off he went on his mare, bidding Grace not to look for him for two  nights to come.    I know not why it was, but what she said of Maskew made me thoughtful and  silent, and she too must be back home lest the old servant that kept  house for them should say she had been too long away, and so we parted.  Then off I went through the woods and down the village street, but as I  passed my old home saw Aunt Jane standing on the doorstep. I bade her  'Good day', and was for running on to the Why Not?, for I was late enough  already, but she called me to her, seeming in a milder mood, and said she  had something for me in the house. So left me standing while she went off  to get it, and back she came and thrust into my hand a little  prayer-book, which I had often seen about the parlour in past days,  saying, 'Here is a Common Prayer which I had meant to send thee with thy  clothes. It was thy poor mother's, and I pray may some day be as precious  a balm to thee as it once was to that godly woman.' With that she gave me  the 'Good day', and I pocketed the little red leather book, which did  indeed afterwards prove precious to me, though not in the way she meant,  and ran down street to the Why Not?           *       *       *       *       *    That same evening Elzevir and I left the Why Not?, went up through the  village, climbed the down, and were at the brow by sunset. We had started  earlier than we fixed the night before, because word had come to Elzevir  that morning that the tide called Gulder would serve for the beaching of  the _Bonaventure_ at three instead of five. 'Tis a strange thing the  Gulder, and not even sailors can count closely with it; for on the Dorset  coast the tide makes four times a day, twice with the common flow, and  twice with the Gulder, and this last being shifty and uncertain as to  time, flings out many a sea-reckoning.    It was about seven o'clock when we were at the top of the hill, and there  were fifteen good miles to cover to get to Hoar Head. Dusk was upon us  before we had walked half an hour; but when the night fell, it was not  black as on the last evening, but a deep sort of blue, and the heat of  the day did not die with the sun, but left the air still warm and balmy.  We trudged on in silence, and were glad enough when we saw by a white  stone here and there at the side of the path that we were nearing the  cliff; for the Preventive men mark all the footpaths on the cliff with  whitewashed stones, so that one can pick up the way without risk on a  dark night. A few minutes more, and we reached a broad piece of open  sward, which I knew for the top of Hoar Head.    Hoar Head is the highest of that line of cliffs, which stretches twenty  miles from Weymouth to St. Alban's Head, and it stands up eighty fathoms  or more above the water. The seaward side is a great sheer of chalk, but  falls not straight into the sea, for three parts down there is a lower  ledge or terrace, called the under-cliff.    'Twas to this ledge that we were bound; and though we were now straight  above, I knew we had a mile or more to go before we could get down to  it. So on we went again, and found the bridle-path that slopes down  through a deep dip in the cliff line; and when we reached this  under-ledge, I looked up at the sky, the night being clear, and guessed  by the stars that 'twas past midnight. I knew the place from having once  been there for blackberries; for the brambles on the under-cliff being  sheltered every way but south, and open to the sun, grow the finest in  all those parts.    We were not alone, for I could make out a score of men, some standing in  groups, some resting on the ground, and the dark shapes of the  pack-horses showing larger in the dimness. There were a few words of  greeting muttered in deep voices, and then all was still, so that one  heard the browsing horses trying to crop something off the turf. It was  not the first cargo I had helped to run, and I knew most of the men, but  did not speak with them, being tired, and wishing to rest till I was  wanted."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#16)"],[1," them  thought but very little of the coming of so small a number. So no one  interfered with their coming, wherefore they were able to bear down with  great speed upon the flank of the party of the King of North Wales.  Therewith they struck that flank with such force that both horses and  horsemen were overturned by their assault.    In that encounter Sir Launcelot carried a spear that was wonderfully strong  and tough. With it he ran with great fierceness into the very thickest of  the press, and before he was checked he struck down five knights with that  one spear. And likewise those three knights that were with him did such  good service that all that flank of the party of the King of North Wales  was thrown into great confusion and wist not what to do for to guard  themselves against that fierce, furious onset.    Then Sir Launcelot and his three companions bore back a little, and when  they got their distance they ran again into the press, and this time Sir  Launcelot overthrew the King of North Wales himself, and that with such  violence that the bone of his thigh was broken, and he had to be carried  away out of that field by his attendants. And in this second assault Sir  Launcelot and the three knights who were with him overthrew eleven knights  besides the King of North Wales, wherefore all that part of the press began  to break away from them and to seek some place where they could defend  themselves from such another assault.    Now when the party of King Bagdemagus saw into what confusion the other  party were thrown by these four knights-champion, they began a very fierce  and furious attack, and with such vehemence that in a little the party of  the King of North Wales began to bear back before them. So, what with those  who withdrew before Sir Launcelot's assault, and what with those who  withdrew from the assault of King Bagdemagus, there was a great deal of  confusion in the ranks of the party of the King of North Wales.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot overthrows Sir Mordred] Now those three knights  who were of King Arthur's court perceived how Sir Launcelot and his  knights-companion were throwing the ranks of the party of the King of North  Wales into confusion, and they knew that unless the onset of Sir Launcelot  was checked, the day would of a surety be lost unto them. Wherefore said  Sir Mador de la Porte: \"Yonder is a very strong and fierce-fighting knight;  if we do not check his onset we will very likely be brought to shame in  this battle.\" \"Yea,\" said Sir Mordred, \"that is so. Now I will take it upon  me to joust with that knight and to overthrow him.\" Upon that those other  two knights bade him go and do as he said. So Sir Mordred made way to where  Sir Launcelot was, coming forward very fiercely and with great violence,  and Sir Launcelot was aware of Sir Mordred's coming and made him ready for  that assault. So the two came together with terrible violence and Sir  Launcelot struck Sir Mordred such a buffet that the breast-band of Sir  Mordred's saddle brake, and both the saddle and Sir Mordred flew over his  horse's tail. Therewith Sir Mordred fell upon his head and struck with such  violence upon the ground that his neck was nigh broken, and he lay  altogether in a dead swoon and had to be carried out of the lists by his  attendants.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot overthrows Sir Mador] This saw Sir Mador de la  Porte, and he cried out: \"Ha! see what hath befallen Sir Mordred!\" And  therewith he also bare down upon Sir Launcelot with all his might and main  with intent to overthrow him. And Sir Launcelot ran against him, and they  struck together so fiercely that it was terrible to behold. But the spear  of Sir Mador de la Porte burst into pieces, whilst the spear of Sir  Launcelot held, so that both Sir Mador and his horse were overthown, the  horse rolling upon the man. And in that encounter Sir Mador's shoulder went  out of place, and he also had to be borne away by his attendants.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot strikes Sir Galahantine a sad blow] Then Sir  Galahantine took a great spear from his esquire, who was nigh him, and he  also ran against Sir Launcelot with all his might; and Sir Launcelot met  him in full course and that onset was more terrible than either of the  other two. For the spear of each knight was burst into splinters, even to  the butt thereof. Then each threw away the butt of his spear and drew out  his sword, and Sir Galahantine struck Sir Launcelot such a blow that the  legs of Sir Launcelot's horse trembled under him because of the weight of  that stroke. At this Sir Launcelot waxed wroth beyond measure and he rose  in his stirrups and he smote Sir Galahantine such a buffet that the blood  burst out from his nose and his ears, and all his senses so went away from  him that he might hardly behold the light of day because of the swimming of  his sight.    Therewith Sir Galahantine's head hung down upon his breast and he had no  power to guide his horse, wherefore his horse made way out of the press and  galloped off, bearing Sir Galahantine away, whether he would or no. And  after the horse had galloped a little distance Sir Galahantine could not  any longer sit upon his saddle, but he fell off of his horse and rolled  over upon the ground and had not strength to rise therefrom.    Then Sir Launcelot catched another spear, great and strong, from the  esquire who followed him, and before ever that spear broke he overthrew  sixteen knights therewith. Wherefore all who beheld him were amazed and  terrified at what he did.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot wins the battle for King Bagdemagus] By now the  party of the King of North Wales began to bear more and more aback and in a  little they broke, and then the party of King Bagdemagus pursued them  hither and thither, and those who did not surrender were overthrown so that  it was not possible for them to make any new order of battle. Then that  party surrendered itself as conquered, one and all, and so King Bagdemagus  won that tournament with the greatest glory that it was possible for him to  have. For it had never been heard of before that a party of four-score  knights should overcome in that way a party of eight-score knights, with  three knights of the Round Table to champion them. Nor would such a victory  have been possible only for what Sir Launcelot did in that battle.    So Sir Launcelot won that tournament for King Bagdemagus, and after the  battle was over and done King Bagdemagus came to Sir Launcelot and said to  him: \"Messire, thou hast brought to me the greatest glory this day that  ever fell to my lot in all of my life. Now I prithee come with me and  refresh thyself with me, so that I may give thee fitting thanks for all  thou hast done, and so that I may reward thee in such a way as is fit for a  king to reward a knight-champion such as thou art.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot departs without reward] Unto this Sir Launcelot  made reply: \"Lord, I give you thanks for your courtesy, but I need no  reward; for it is meet that I should have done what I could for the sake of  the demoiselle Elouise the Fair, seeing that she rescued me from the  mischiefs that Queen Morgana had intent to do me.\"    Then King Bagdemagus besought Sir Launcelot that he would tarry awhile and  rest, but Sir Launcelot would not do so, but would be going upon his way  without any tarrying. But he said to King Bagdemagus: \"I prithee greet your  daughter for me, and say to her that if ever she hath need of my services  again let her send to me, and I will come to her even if it be to the end  of the earth. For I have not yet repaid her for what she hath done for me.\"    Therewith Sir Launcelot went his way from that meadow of battle, and,  coming to the skirts of the forest he entered therein, and those who were  there at the meadow of battle did not see him any more.    So endeth the history of that famous tournament betwixt King Bagdemagus and  the King of North Wales.    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot climbs to catch the lady's falcon]          Chapter Seventh      _How Sir Launcelot Fell Into the Greatest Peril that Ever He Encountered in  all His Life. Also How He Freed a Misfortunate Castle and Town From the  Giants Who Held Them, and How He Released the Lord Thereof From a Dungeon._    Now Sir Launcelot wandered errant for many days, meeting no adventure of  any moment, but taking great joy in all that he beheld of the wide world  about him, and in that time he found lodging wheresoever he chanced to be  (if not in house, then beneath the skies), and he endured all sorts of  weather, both wet and dry.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot cometh to a fair valley with a castle] Upon a  certain day, in the prime of the morning, he came across a hilltop, and  beheld beneath him a valley, very fertile and well-tilled, with fields and  meadow-lands spread all over it like to a fair green carpet woven in divers  patterns. And in the midst of the valley was a very large and noble castle,  with many towers, and tall, steep roofs, and clustering chimneys. So Sir  Launcelot descended into that valley, and the road which he took ended in  front of the castle and under the shade of the tall gray walls thereof. But  he did not stop at that castle but went on by it.    Now after Sir Launcelot had passed by that castle it seemed to him that he  heard very delicate silver bells ringing sweetly in the air above him, and  when he looked up he beheld that a falcon was flying over his head toward a  high elm tree that stood at a little distance, and he wist that it was the  bells upon the cap of the falcon that rang so sweetly. And Sir Launcelot  beheld that long lunes hung from the feet of the falcon as she flew,  wherefore he was aware that the falcon had slipped her lunes and had flown  from her owner.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot beholdeth a falcon entangled] So Sir Launcelot  watched the falcon, and he beheld that she lit in a tall elm tree, where"]]]
