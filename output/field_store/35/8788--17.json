Has he frightened him? Perhaps he won't come.\"--A  film passed over her eyes, and her heart beat quite quick.    \"You're always joking,\" said she, smiling as innocently as she could.  \"Joke away, Mr. George; there's nobody to defend ME.\" And George  Osborne, as she walked away--and Amelia looked reprovingly at him--felt  some little manly compunction for having inflicted any unnecessary  unkindness upon this helpless creature.  \"My dearest Amelia,\" said he,  \"you are too good--too kind.  You don't know the world.  I do.  And  your little friend Miss Sharp must learn her station.\"    \"Don't you think Jos will--\"    \"Upon my word, my dear, I don't know.  He may, or may not.  I'm not his  master.  I only know he is a very foolish vain fellow, and put my dear  little girl into a very painful and awkward position last night.  My  dearest diddle-diddle-darling!\" He was off laughing again, and he did  it so drolly that Emmy laughed too.    All that day Jos never came.  But Amelia had no fear about this; for  the little schemer had actually sent away the page, Mr. Sambo's  aide-de-camp, to Mr. Joseph's lodgings, to ask for some book he had  promised, and how he was; and the reply through Jos's man, Mr. Brush,  was, that his master was ill in bed, and had just had the doctor with  him.  He must come to-morrow, she thought, but she never had the  courage to speak a word on the subject to Rebecca; nor did that young  woman herself allude to it in any way during the whole evening after  the night at Vauxhall.    The next day, however, as the two young ladies sate on the sofa,  pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, Sambo came  into the room with his usual engaging grin, with a packet under his  arm, and a note on a tray.  \"Note from Mr. Jos, Miss,\" says Sambo.    How Amelia trembled as she opened it!    So it ran:    Dear Amelia,--I send you the \"Orphan of the Forest.\" I was too ill to  come yesterday.  I leave town to-day for Cheltenham.  Pray excuse me,  if you can, to the amiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vauxhall, and  entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when  excited by that fatal supper.  As soon as I have recovered, for my  health is very much shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and  am    Truly yours, Jos Sedley    It was the death-warrant.  All was over.  Amelia did not dare to look  at Rebecca's pale face and burning eyes, but she dropt the letter into  her friend's lap; and got up, and went upstairs to her room, and cried  her little heart out.    Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with  consolation, on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relieved  herself a good deal.  \"Don't take on, Miss.  I didn't like to tell you.  But none of us in the house have liked her except at fust.  I sor her  with my own eyes reading your Ma's letters.  Pinner says she's always  about your trinket-box and drawers, and everybody's drawers, and she's  sure she's put your white ribbing into her box.\"    \"I gave it her, I gave it her,\" Amelia said.    But this did not alter Mrs. Blenkinsop's opinion of Miss Sharp.  \"I  don't trust them governesses, Pinner,\" she remarked to the maid. \"They  give themselves the hairs and hupstarts of ladies, and their wages is  no better than you nor me.\"    It now became clear to every soul in the house, except poor Amelia,  that Rebecca should take her departure, and high and low (always with  the one exception) agreed that that event should take place as speedily  as possible. Our good child ransacked all her drawers, cupboards,  reticules, and gimcrack boxes--passed in review all her gowns, fichus,  tags, bobbins, laces, silk stockings, and fallals--selecting this thing  and that and the other, to make a little heap for Rebecca.  And going  to her Papa, that generous British merchant, who had promised to give  her as many guineas as she was years old--she begged the old gentleman  to give the money to dear Rebecca, who must want it, while she lacked  for nothing.    She even made George Osborne contribute, and nothing loth (for he was  as free-handed a young fellow as any in the army), he went to Bond  Street, and bought the best hat and spenser that money could buy.    \"That's George's present to you, Rebecca, dear,\" said Amelia, quite  proud of the bandbox conveying these gifts.  \"What a taste he has!  There's nobody like him.\"    \"Nobody,\" Rebecca answered.  \"How thankful I am to him!\" She was  thinking in her heart, \"It was George Osborne who prevented my  marriage.\"--And she loved George Osborne accordingly.    She made her preparations for departure with great equanimity; and  accepted all the kind little Amelia's presents, after just the proper  degree of hesitation and reluctance.  She vowed eternal gratitude to  Mrs. Sedley, of course; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady  too much, who was embarrassed, and evidently wishing to avoid her.  She  kissed Mr. Sedley's hand, when he presented her with the purse; and  asked permission to consider him for the future as her kind, kind  friend and protector.  Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going  to write her a cheque for twenty pounds more; but he restrained his  feelings: the carriage was in waiting to take him to dinner, so he  tripped away with a \"God bless you, my dear, always come here when you  come to town, you know.--Drive to the Mansion House, James.\"    Finally came the parting with Miss Amelia, over which picture I intend  to throw a veil.  But after a scene in which one person was in earnest  and the other a perfect performer--after the tenderest caresses, the  most pathetic tears, the smelling-bottle, and some of the very best  feelings of the heart, had been called into requisition--Rebecca and  Amelia parted, the former vowing to love her friend for ever and ever  and ever.        CHAPTER VII    Crawley of Queen's Crawley    Among the most respected of the names beginning in C which the  Court-Guide contained, in the year 18--, was that of Crawley, Sir Pitt,  Baronet, Great Gaunt Street, and Queen's Crawley, Hants.  This  honourable name had figured constantly also in the Parliamentary list  for many years, in conjunction with that of a number of other worthy  gentlemen who sat in turns for the borough.    It is related, with regard to the borough of Queen's Crawley, that  Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses, stopping at Crawley to  breakfast, was so delighted with some remarkably fine Hampshire beer  which was then presented to her by the Crawley of the day (a handsome  gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwith erected  Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and the  place, from the day of that illustrious visit, took the name of Queen's  Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment.  And though, by the  lapse of time, and those mutations which age produces in empires,  cities, and boroughs, Queen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place  as it had been in Queen Bess's time--nay, was come down to that  condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten--yet, as Sir  Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way,  \"Rotten! be hanged--it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.\"    Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the great Commoner) was the son of  Walpole Crawley, first Baronet, of the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office in  the reign of George II., when he was impeached for peculation, as were  a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days; and Walpole  Crawley was, as need scarcely be said, son of John Churchill Crawley,  named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of Queen  Anne.  The family tree (which hangs up at Queen's Crawley) furthermore  mentions Charles Stuart, afterwards called Barebones Crawley, son of  the Crawley of James the First's time; and finally, Queen Elizabeth's  Crawley, who is represented as the foreground of the picture in his  forked beard and armour.  Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a tree,  on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are  inscribed.  Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet (the subject  of the present memoir), are written that of his brother, the Reverend  Bute Crawley (the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend  gentleman was born), rector of Crawley-cum-Snailby, and of various  other male and female members of the Crawley family.    Sir Pitt was first married to Grizzel, sixth daughter of Mungo Binkie,  Lord Binkie, and cousin, in consequence, of Mr. Dundas.  She brought  him two sons: Pitt, named not so much after his father as after the  heaven-born minister; and Rawdon Crawley, from the Prince of Wales's  friend, whom his Majesty George IV forgot so completely. Many years  after her ladyship's demise, Sir Pitt led to the altar Rosa, daughter  of Mr. G. Dawson, of Mudbury, by whom he had two daughters, for whose  benefit Miss Rebecca Sharp was now engaged as governess.  It will be  seen that the young lady was come into a family of very genteel  connexions, and was about to move in a much more distinguished circle  than that humble one which she had just quitted in Russell Square.    She had received her orders to join her pupils, in a note which was  written upon an old envelope, and which contained the following words:    Sir Pitt Crawley begs Miss Sharp and baggidge may be hear on Tuesday,  as I leaf for Queen's Crawley to-morrow morning ERLY.    Great Gaunt Street.    Rebecca had never seen a Baronet, as far as she knew, and as soon as  she had taken leave of Amelia, and counted the guineas which  good-natured Mr. Sedley had put into a purse for her, and as soon as  she had done wiping her eyes with her handkerchief (which operation she  concluded the very moment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#15)"],[1,"of war  was held as to our movements, and we decided, in spite of our recent  experiences, to turn our horses, who had done quite enough for the  present, out on the run, and so make our way down the lake by boat.  Already F---- was beginning to look anxious, for he perceived that,  even after the head of the lake had been reached, the wool would cost an  enormous sum to cart down to either Oamaru or Timaru, from whence alone  it could be shipped.    The mile or two of the run which lay along the shore of the lake showed  us frightfully rough country. A dense jungle of tussocks and thorny  bushes choked up the feed, and made it impossible to drive any animals  through it, even supposing that good pasturage lay beyond. Still we  hoped that we might be looking at the worst portion of our purchase, and  deter mined to persevere in the attempt to penetrate to the furthest  end of our new property. Accordingly we hired a safe old tub of a boat  which, though too heavy to pull, was warranted to sail steadily, and  with a couple of men, some cold mutton, bread, tea, and sugar, started  valiantly on our cruise. But the \"blue, unclouded weather,\" in which  we had hitherto basked, was at an end for the present. We had already  enjoyed a longer succession of calm days than usually falls to the lot  of the travellers in that windy middle island, and it was now quite time  for the imprisoned \"nor'-wester\" to have his turn over the surface of  the domain.    Accordingly the first day's sail was against a light, ominously warm  head-wind, and we only made any way at all by keeping up a complicated  system of tacking. The start had not been an early one, so darkness  found us but little advanced on our voyage, and we passed the night in a  rough shanty, on beds of fern-leaves, wrapped in our red blankets. Tired  as we were, none of us could sleep much. The air was dry and parched;  every now and then a sough of the rising hot gale swept through our  crazy shelter without cooling us, and warned us to prepare for what was  coming. Our only chance of getting on was to make an early start, for  fortunately a true \"nor'-wester\" is somewhat of a sluggard. The skies  wore their peculiar chrysoprase green tint, except towards the weather  quarter, where heavy banks of lurid cloud showed that the enemy was  collecting in force. Even the hour of dawn, usually so crisp and cool,  brought no sense of refreshment to our languid limbs, and we embarked  with the direst forebodings. A few miles further up the lake we reached  an out-station hut, built by our host Mr. Johnson when he first \"took  up\" his country and intended to push his boundary as far as this. He  soon drew in his lines however on account of the rough nature of the  ground. The hut was in a most picturesque spot, and although deserted,  remained still in good repair. The little scrap of garden ground was a  tangle of gooseberry and currant bushes among which potatoes flourished  at their own sweet will.    We had only time to beach the boat, that is to say F---- and the two  men did so, whilst I ran backwards and forwards with the blankets and  provisions, before the hurricane was upon us. Henceforth there was no  stirring out of doors until the gale had blown itself out. We dragged  in some driftwood, barricaded the door, and prepared to pass the time  as well as we could. Oh, the fleas in the hut! The ground was literally  alive with them, and their audacity and appetite was unparalleled.  Our boatmen sat tranquilly by the tiny window and played cribbage  incessantly with very dirty cards and a board made out of a small bar of  soap. As for me, I turned an empty box up on its end, so as to get  out of the way of the fleas, and perched myself on it, finding ample  occupation in defending my position from the attacks of the active  little wretches. Sometimes I felt as if I must rush out into the  lake and drown myself and my tormentors together. It was very bad for  everybody. The poor boatmen doubtless wished to smoke, but were too  polite to do anything of the sort. F---- had nothing whatever to read,  except a torn piece of an old _Times_, at least two years old, which we  had brought to wrap up some of our provisions; whilst I was still more  idle and wretched. Two weary interminable days dragged, or perhaps I  should say, blew, themselves along in this miserable fashion, but at  sundown on the evening of the third day the wind dropped suddenly, and  we did not lose a moment in darting out of our prison and embarking once  more. For the first time since we started we could perceive the grandeur  of the surrounding country; but grand scenery is not necessary nor  indeed desirable in a sheep run. Splendid mountains ran down in steep  spurs to the very shore of the enormous lake. Behind them, piled in  snowy steeps, rose the distant Alps of the Antipodes; great masses of  native bush made dark purple shadows among the clefts of the hills,  whilst the lake rippled in and out of many a graceful bay and quiet  harbour. Not a fleck or film of cloud floated between us and the serene  and darkening sky; a profound, delightful calm brooded over land and  water. Although there was no moon, the stars served us as lights and  compass until two o'clock in the morning, by which time we had reached  the head of the lake (which is thirty-five miles in length), where we  landed, extemporized a tent out of the boat sail, and turned in for a  refreshing flea-less sleep.    The next day was beautifully still, with a light air from the opposite  point, just sufficient to cool the parched atmosphere; and we made our  way along the head of the lake to a place were a couple of sawyers were  at work. One of them had brought his wife with him, and her welcome to  me was the most touching thing in the world. She took me entirely under  her care, and would hardly let me out of her sight. I must say it was  very nice to be waited on so faithfully, and I gave myself up to  the unaccustomed luxury. All she required of me in exchange for her  incessant toil on my behalf was \"news.\" It did not matter of what kind,  every scrap of intelligence was welcome to her, and she refused to tell  me to what date her \"latest advices\" extended. During the three days of  our stay in that clearing among the great pines of the Wanaka Bush,  I gave my hostess a complete abridgment of the history of  England--political, social, and moral, beginning from my earliest  recollections. Then we ran over contemporary foreign affairs, dwelt  minutely on every scrap of colonial news, and finally wound up with a  full, true, and particular account of myself and all my relations  and friends. When I paused for breath she would cease her washing and  cooking on my behalf, and say entreatingly, \"Go on now, do!\" until I  felt quite desperate.    All this time whilst I was being \"interviewed\" nearly to death,  F----employed himself in making excursions to different parts of the  run. One of the sawyers lent him a miserable half-starved little pony;  and he penetrated to another sawyer's hut, seven miles distant up the  Matukituki river. But no matter whether he turned his steps to north or  south, east or west, he met with the same disheartening report. There  was the ground indeed, but it was perfectly useless. Not only was there  was _no_ pasturage, but if there had been, the nature of the country  would have rendered it valueless, on account of the way it was  overgrown. It would be tedious to explain more minutely why this was  the case. Sufficient must it be to say that whilst F---- was only too  anxious to keep his eyes shut as to the ground he had alighted on after  his leap in the dark, and the sawyers were equally anxious to induce  settlers to come there, and so bring a market for their labour close to  their hand nothing could make our purchase appear anything except a dead  loss. As for the plans, they were purely imaginary. The blue lake was  about the only part true to nature; and even that should have had a  foot-note to state that it was generally lashed into high, unnavigable  waves, by a chronic nor'-wester.    No: there was nothing for it but to go home again to the little run  which had seemed such a mere paddock in our eyes, whilst we indulged  in castle-building over 100,000 acres of country. It was of no use  lingering amid such disappointment and discomfort; besides which my  listener, the sawyer's wife, had turned her husband and herself out of  their hut, and were sleeping under a red blanket tent. Poor woman, she  was most anxious to get away; and the lovely sylvan scene, with the tall  trees standing like sentinels over their prostrate brethren, the wealth  of beauteous greenery, springing through fronds of fern and ground  creepers, the bright-winged flight of paroquets and other bush birds,  even the vast expanse of the lake which stretched almost from their  threshold for so many miles, all would have been gladly exchanged for a  dusty high street in any country town-ship. Her last words were, \"Can't  you send me a paper or hany thing printed, mam?\" I faithfully promised  to do my best, and carried out my share of the bargain by despatching  to her a large packet of miscellaneous periodicals and newspapers; but  whether she ever received them is more than I can say.    We were afraid of lingering too long, lest another nor'-wester should  become due; and we therefore started as soon as F---- had decided that  it was of no use exploring our wretched purchase any further. We had a  stiff breeze from the north-west all the way down the lake; but as it  was right a-stern it helped us along to such good purpose, that one  day's sailing before it brought us back to Mr. Johnson's homestead  and comparative civilization. The little parlour and the tiny bed-room  beyond, into which I could only get access by climbing through a  window (for the architect had forgotten to put a door), appeared like  apartments "]]]
