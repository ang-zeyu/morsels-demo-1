And  now Mr. McMickle says my handicap would be a good twenty-four on any  links.\" She smiled apologetically. \"Of course, that doesn't sound much  to you! You were a twelve when I left you, and now I suppose you are  down to eight or something.\"    Mortimer shook his head.    \"Alas, no!\" he replied, gravely. \"My game went right off for some  reason or other, and I'm twenty-four, too.\"    \"For some reason or other!\" She uttered a cry. \"Oh, I know what the  reason was! How can I ever forgive myself! I have ruined your game!\"    The brightness came back to Mortimer's eyes. He embraced her fondly.    \"Do not reproach yourself, dearest,\" he murmured. \"It is the best thing  that could have happened. From now on, we start level, two hearts that  beat as one, two drivers that drive as one. I could not wish it  otherwise. By George! It's just like that thing of Tennyson's.\"    He recited the lines softly:                     _My bride,      My wife, my life. Oh, we will walk the links      Yoked in all exercise of noble end,      And so thro' those dark bunkers off the course      That no man knows. Indeed, I love thee: come,      Yield thyself up: our handicaps are one;      Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;      Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me._    She laid her hands in his.    \"And now, Mortie, darling,\" she said, \"I want to tell you all about how  I did the long twelfth at Auchtermuchtie in one under bogey.\"          5    _The Salvation of George Mackintosh_      The young man came into the club-house. There was a frown on his  usually cheerful face, and he ordered a ginger-ale in the sort of voice  which an ancient Greek would have used when asking the executioner to  bring on the hemlock.    Sunk in the recesses of his favourite settee the Oldest Member had  watched him with silent sympathy.    \"How did you get on?\" he inquired.    \"He beat me.\"    The Oldest Member nodded his venerable head.    \"You have had a trying time, if I am not mistaken. I feared as much  when I saw you go out with Pobsley. How many a young man have I seen go  out with Herbert Pobsley exulting in his youth, and crawl back at  eventide looking like a toad under the harrow! He talked?\"    \"All the time, confound it! Put me right off my stroke.\"    The Oldest Member sighed.    \"The talking golfer is undeniably the most pronounced pest of our  complex modern civilization,\" he said, \"and the most difficult to deal  with. It is a melancholy thought that the noblest of games should have  produced such a scourge. I have frequently marked Herbert Pobsley in  action. As the crackling of thorns under a pot.... He is almost as bad  as poor George Mackintosh in his worst period. Did I ever tell you  about George Mackintosh?\"    \"I don't think so.\"    \"His,\" said the Sage, \"is the only case of golfing garrulity I have  ever known where a permanent cure was affected. If you would care to  hear about it----?\"           *       *       *       *       *    George Mackintosh (said the Oldest Member), when I first knew him, was  one of the most admirable young fellows I have ever met. A handsome,  well-set-up man, with no vices except a tendency to use the mashie for  shots which should have been made with the light iron. And as for his  positive virtues, they were too numerous to mention. He never swayed  his body, moved his head, or pressed. He was always ready to utter a  tactful grunt when his opponent foozled. And when he himself achieved a  glaring fluke, his self-reproachful click of the tongue was music to  his adversary's bruised soul. But of all his virtues the one that most  endeared him to me and to all thinking men was the fact that, from the  start of a round to the finish, he never spoke a word except when  absolutely compelled to do so by the exigencies of the game. And it was  this man who subsequently, for a black period which lives in the memory  of all his contemporaries, was known as Gabby George and became a shade  less popular than the germ of Spanish Influenza. Truly, _corruptio  optimi pessima!_    One of the things that sadden a man as he grows older and reviews his  life is the reflection that his most devastating deeds were generally  the ones which he did with the best motives. The thought is  disheartening. I can honestly say that, when George Mackintosh came to  me and told me his troubles, my sole desire was to ameliorate his lot.  That I might be starting on the downward path a man whom I liked and  respected never once occurred to me.    One night after dinner when George Mackintosh came in, I could see at  once that there was something on his mind, but what this could be I was  at a loss to imagine, for I had been playing with him myself all the  afternoon, and he had done an eighty-one and a seventy-nine. And, as I  had not left the links till dusk was beginning to fall, it was  practically impossible that he could have gone out again and done  badly. The idea of financial trouble seemed equally out of the  question. George had a good job with the old-established legal firm of  Peabody, Peabody, Peabody, Peabody, Cootes, Toots, and Peabody. The  third alternative, that he might be in love, I rejected at once. In all  the time I had known him I had never seen a sign that George Mackintosh  gave a thought to the opposite sex.    Yet this, bizarre as it seemed, was the true solution. Scarcely had he  seated himself and lit a cigar when he blurted out his confession.    \"What would you do in a case like this?\" he said.    \"Like what?\"    \"Well----\" He choked, and a rich blush permeated his surface. \"Well, it  seems a silly thing to say and all that, but I'm in love with Miss  Tennant, you know!\"    \"You are in love with Celia Tennant?\"    \"Of course I am. I've got eyes, haven't I? Who else is there that any  sane man could possibly be in love with? That,\" he went on, moodily,  \"is the whole trouble. There's a field of about twenty-nine, and I  should think my place in the betting is about thirty-three to one.\"    \"I cannot agree with you there,\" I said. \"You have every advantage, it  appears to me. You are young, amiable, good-looking, comfortably off,  scratch----\"    \"But I can't talk, confound it!\" he burst out. \"And how is a man to get  anywhere at this sort of game without talking?\"    \"You are talking perfectly fluently now.\"    \"Yes, to you. But put me in front of Celia Tennant, and I simply make a  sort of gurgling noise like a sheep with the botts. It kills my chances  stone dead. You know these other men. I can give Claude Mainwaring a  third and beat him. I can give Eustace Brinkley a stroke a hole and  simply trample on his corpse. But when it comes to talking to a girl,  I'm not in their class.\"    \"You must not be diffident.\"    \"But I _am_ diffident. What's the good of saying I mustn't be  diffident when I'm the man who wrote the words and music, when  Diffidence is my middle name and my telegraphic address? I can't help  being diffident.\"    \"Surely you could overcome it?\"    \"But how? It was in the hope that you might be able to suggest  something that I came round tonight.\"    And this was where I did the fatal thing. It happened that, just before  I took up \"Braid on the Push-Shot,\" I had been dipping into the current  number of a magazine, and one of the advertisements, I chanced to  remember, might have been framed with a special eye to George's  unfortunate case. It was that one, which I have no doubt you have seen,  which treats of \"How to Become a Convincing Talker\". I picked up this  magazine now and handed it to George.    He studied it for a few minutes in thoughtful silence. He looked at the  picture of the Man who had taken the course being fawned upon by lovely  women, while the man who had let this opportunity slip stood outside  the group gazing with a wistful envy.    \"They never do that to me,\" said George.    \"Do what, my boy?\"    \"Cluster round, clinging cooingly.\"    \"I gather from the letterpress that they will if you write for the  booklet.\"    \"You think there is really something in it?\"    \"I see no reason why eloquence should not be taught by mail. One seems  to be able to acquire every other desirable quality in that manner  nowadays.\"    \"I might try it. After all, it's not expensive. There's no doubt about  it,\" he murmured, returning to his perusal, \"that fellow does look  popular. Of course, the evening dress may have something to do with  it.\"    \"Not at all. The other man, you will notice, is also wearing evening  dress, and yet he is merely among those on the outskirts. It is simply  a question of writing for the booklet.\"    \"Sent post free.\"    \"Sent, as you say, post free.\"    \"I've a good mind to try it.\"    \"I see no reason why you should not.\"    \"I will, by Duncan!\" He tore the page out of the magazine and put it in  his pocket. \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give this thing a trial  for a week or two, and at the end of that time I'll go to the boss and  see how he reacts when I ask for a rise of salary. If he crawls, it'll  show there's something in this. If he flings me out, it will prove the  thing's no good.\"    We left it at that, and I am bound to say--owing, no doubt, to my not  having written for the booklet of the Memory Training Course advertised  on the adjoining page of the magazine--the matter slipped from my mind.  When, therefore, a few weeks later, I received a telegram from young  Mackintosh which ran:        _Worked like magic,_    I confess I was intensely puzzled. It was only a quarter of an hour  before George himself arrived that I solved the problem of its meaning.    \"So the boss crawled?\" I said, as he came in.    He gave a light, confident laugh. I had not seen him, as I say, for  some time, and I was struck by the alteration in his appearance. In  what exactly this alteration consisted I could not at first have said;  but gradually it began"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#15)"],[1,"as if  it fled towards the sea. This presage of evil created a profound  impression.    \"What do you think of it, Cneius?\" Berenice asked; \"it is terrible,  is it not? Nothing else is spoken of among all the ladies I have  seen today, and all agree it forbodes some terrible evil.\"    \"It may, or it may not,\" the old scribe said cautiously; \"if the  statue has fallen by the action of the gods the omen is surely a  most evil one.\"    \"But how else could it have fallen, Cneius?\"    \"Well, my dear, there are many Britons in the town, and you know  they are in a very excited state; their women, indeed, seem to  have gone well nigh mad with their midnight singing and wailing.  It is possible--mind, I do not for a moment say that it is so,  for were the suggestion to occur to the citizens it would lead to  fresh oppressions and cruelties against the Britons--but it is  just possible that some of them may have entered the temple at night  and overthrown Victory's image as an act of defiance. You know how  the women nightly shriek out their prophecies of the destruction  of this town.\"    \"But could they destroy it, Cneius? Surely they would never dare  to attack a great Roman city like this!\"    \"I don't know whether they dare or not, Berenice, but assuredly  Decianus is doing all in his power to excite them to such a pitch  of despair that they might dare do anything; and if they dare,  I see nothing whatever to prevent them from taking the city. The  works erected after Claudius first founded the colony are so vast  that they would require an army to defend them, while there are but  a few hundred soldiers here. What could they do against a horde of  barbarians? I would that your father were back, and also the two  legions who marched away to join Suetonius. Before they went they  ought to have erected a central fort here, to which all could retire  in case of danger, and hold out until Suetonius came back to our  assistance; but you see, when they went away none could have foreseen  what has since taken place. No one could have dreamt that Decianus  would have wantonly stirred up the Iceni to revolt.\"    \"But you don't think they have revolted?\"    \"I know nothing of it, Berenice, but I can put two and two together.  We have heard nothing for a week from the officials who went to  seize the possessions of Prasutagus. How is it that none of our  messengers have returned? It seems to me almost certain that these  men have paid for their conduct to the daughters of Boadicea with  their lives.\"    \"But Beric is with the Iceni. Surely we should hear from him if  danger threatened.\"    \"He is with them,\" Cneius said, \"but he is a chief, and if the  tribe are in arms he is in arms also, and cannot, without risking  the forfeit of his life for treachery, send hither a message that  would put us on our guard. I believe in the lad. Four years I  taught him, and I think I know his nature. He is honest and true.  He is one of the Iceni and must go with his countrymen; but I am  sure he is grateful for the kindness he received here, and has a  real affection for you, therefore I believe, that should my worst  fears be verified, and the Iceni attack Camalodunum, he will do  his utmost to save you.\"    \"But they will not kill women and girls surely, even if they did  take the city?\"    \"I fear that they will show slight mercy to any, Berenice; why  should they? We have shown no mercy to them; we have slaughtered  their priests and priestesses, and at the storm of their towns  have put all to death without distinction of age or sex. If we, a  civilized people, thus make war, what can you expect from the men  upon whom we have inflicted such countless injuries?\"    The fall of the statue of Victory was succeeded by other occurrences  in which the awestruck inhabitants read augury of evil. It was  reported that strange noises had been heard in the council house  and theatre, while men out in boats brought back the tale that  there was the appearance of a sunken town below the water. It was  currently believed that the sea had assumed the colour of blood,  and that there were, when the tide went out, marks upon the sand  as if dead bodies had been lying there. Even the boldest veterans  were dismayed at this accumulation of hostile auguries. A council  of the principal citizens was held, and an urgent message despatched  to Decianus, praying that he would take instance measures for the  protection of the city. In reply to this he despatched two hundred  soldiers from Verulamium, and these with the small body of troops  already in the city took possession of the Temple of Claudius, and  began to make preparations for putting it into a state of defence.    Still no message had come from Norwich, but night after night the  British women declared that the people of Camalodunum would suffer  the same fate that had already overwhelmed those who had ventured  to insult the daughters of the queen of the Iceni. A strange terror  had now seized the inhabitants of the town. The apprehension of  danger weighted upon all, and the peril seemed all the more terrible  inasmuch as it was so vague. Nothing was known for certain. No  message had come from the Iceni since the queen quitted the town,  and yet it was felt that among the dark woods stretching north a  host of foes was gathering, and might at any moment pour down upon  the city. Orders were issued that at the approach of danger all  who could do so were to betake themselves at once to the temple,  which was to act as a citadel, yet no really effective measures  were taken. There was, indeed, a vague talk of sending the women and  children and valuables away to the legion, commanded by Cerealis,  stationed in a fortified camp to the south, but nothing came of  it; all waited for something definite, some notification that the  Britons had really revolted, and while waiting for this nothing  was done.    One evening a slave brought in a small roll of vellum to Cneius.  It had been given him at the door, he said, by a Briton, who had  at once left after placing it in his hands. The scribe opened it  and read as follows:--    \"To Cneius Nepo, greeting--Obtain British garb for yourself and  Berenice. Let her apparel be that of a boy. Should anything unusual  occur by night or day, do you and she disguise yourselves quickly,  and stir not beyond the house. It will be best for you to wait in  the tablinum; lose no time in carrying out this instruction.\"    There was no signature, nor was any needed.    \"So the storm is about to burst,\" Cneius said thoughtfully when  he had read it. \"I thought so. I was sure that if the Britons had  a spark of manhood left in them they would avenge the cruel wrongs  of their queen. I am rejoiced to read Beric's words, and to see  that he has, as I felt sure he had, a grateful heart. He would  save us from the fate that he clearly thinks is about to overwhelm  this place. The omens have not lied then--not that I believe in  them; they are for the most part the offspring of men's fancy, but  at any rate they will come true this time. I care little for myself,  but I must do as he bids me for the sake of the girl. I doubt, though  whether Beric can save her. These people have terrible wrongs to  avenge, and at their first outburst will spare none. Well, I must  do my best, and late as it is I will go out and purchase these  garments. It is not likely that the danger will come tonight, for  he would have given us longer notice. Still he may have had no  opportunity, and may not have known until the last moment when the  attack was to take place. He says 'lose no time.'\"    Cneius at once went to one of the traders who dealt with the natives  who came into the town, and procured the garments for himself and  Berenice. The trader, who knew him by sight, remarked, \"Have you  been purchasing more slaves?\"    \"No, but I have need for dresses for two persons who have done me  some service.\"    \"I should have thought,\" the trader said, \"they would have preferred  lighter colours. These cloths are sombre, and the natives, although  their own cloths are for the most part dark, prefer, when they buy  of me, brighter colours.\"    \"These will do very well,\" Cneius said, \"just at present Roman  colours and cloths are not likely to be in demand among them.\"    \"No, the times are bad,\" the trader said; \"there has been scarce  a native in my shop for the last ten days, and even among the  townspeople there has been little buying or selling.\"    Cneius returned to the house, a slave carrying his purchases behind  him. On reaching home he took the parcel from him, and carried it  to his own cubicule, and then ordered a slave to beg Berenice to  come down from her apartment as he desired to speak with her.        CHAPTER V: THE SACK OF CAMALODUNUM      Upon the morning of the day fixed for the gathering of the Iceni  preparations were begun early at Cardun. Oxen and swine were  slaughtered, great fires made, and the women in the village were  all employed in making and baking oaten cakes upon the hearth. For  some days many of them had been employed in making a great store  of fermented honey and water. Men began to flock in from an early  hour, and by midday every male of the Sarci capable of bearing  arms had come in. Each brought with him a supply of cooked meat and  cakes sufficient to last for three or four days. In the afternoon  the tribes began to pour in, each tribe under its chiefs. There  was no attempt at order or regularity; they came trooping in in  masses, the chiefs sometimes in chariots sometimes on horseback,  riding at their head. Parta welcomed them, and food was served out  to the men while the chiefs were entertained in the hall. Beric,  looking at the wild figures, rough and uncouth but powerful and  massive in frame, was filled with regret that these men knew nothing  of discipline, and that circumstances had forced on the war so  suddenly.
