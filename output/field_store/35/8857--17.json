It has lodged among some trees and rocks, and I do not  believe a wheel has been broken.\"    \"That's so, Jack, though I reckon it don't make any difference to us. But  if 'em rocks don't start to grow it's 'cause the nitrate ain't any good,  for the stuff is sowed all over the Andes.\"    \"It is pretty well scattered, that is a fact. But come, boys, we must  hitch on the other oxen, and see if the double team can pull this load to  the top.\"    Though the loss of one of his wagons and a portion of his nitrate, which  had cost him so much to get so far, was felt keenly by Jack, he showed his  indomitable will by immediately giving his attention toward carrying out  the work of crossing the ridge.    The remaining load proved an easy burden for the united teams, and in a  few minutes the heavy wagon was moving slowly up the path, the loud  commands of the Peruvian drivers echoing up and down the valley with  somewhat startling effect.    \"As soon as we get to the summit,\" said Jack to Plum, \"you and I will go  back and see if there is not some way to save the other wagon, even at the  sacrifice of its load.\"    \"I s'pose we might throw off what nitrate there is left on it, and by  hitching together all the chains and ropes we have--\"    \"I wonder what is wrong now,\" exclaimed Jack, for the team had again  stopped, though the wagon was not more than its length from the summit. To  the drivers he shouted:    \"Drive up a little further, so the wagon will stand without--\"    Loud, angry cries stopped him in the midst of his speech.    Anxious to know what had caused another interruption in the advance, he  hurried forward, to meet a most unexpected sight.    Drawn up in front of the team in the narrow path was a squad of Chilian  soldiers, or bushwhackers, more properly speaking, for he knew they did  not belong to the regular army.    The Peruvians were cowering by the side of the wagon and cattle, muttering  over something in their native tongue which our hero did not understand.    \"Ho, there, soldiers!\" he called out, in his best Spanish, \"what does this  mean?\"    \"It means if you don't get out of our path, Americanos, we will hew you  down!\"    \"Don't be too fast, senor captain,\" Jack made bold to say, \"this path is  one of my own making, though if you will allow me to get my team to the--\"    \"Pitiful dog!\" cried the Chilian, \"Captain de Costa commands you to clear  his way without any insulting words.\"    Jack saw that it would be worse than useless to have any words with this  imperious Chilian, who in his petty command felt more arrogant than a king  on this throne. Accordingly he began in a respectful tone:    \"If Captain de Costa will kindly allow us to drive to the summit we shall  be able--\"    \"Americano dog! will you surrender?\"    By this time the Peruvians had taken to their heels, and Jack and Plum  stood alone in front of the pompous captain and legion.    Jack's first thought was to boldly refuse the demand, knowing the other  had no business to interfere with him, and to make such a resistance as he  and his companion could. But single-handed, against such odds, he knew it  would be folly.    \"If you please, Captain de Costa, we two are but peaceful American boys,  both of us engaged--\"    \"Will you surrender?\" thundered the Chilian, advancing with uplifted  sword, as if he would carry out his threat of hewing him down.    \"We are offering no resistance to you, senor captain. If you will allow us  to--\"    At a motion from the Chilian leader his soldiers leaped forward, and Jack  and Plum were quickly made prisoners.    The order was then given for the lads to be intrusted to a portion of  troops under the command of a sergeant, and then the march down the  pathway toward the nearest town was begun.    The last Jack saw of his team it was still standing just over the brow of  the height, the patient oxen chewing their cuds as unconcerned as if the  fortunes and the lives of their owners were not in the least endangered.    \"What is going to be the end of this?\" asked Plum, as they were marched  along side by side.    \"It is impossible to tell. I do not think it will be best for us to have  much to say to each other if we wish to keep together. We must keep our  eyes open for a chance to escape.\"    Plum taking the hint, the friends walked along in silence until the  journey seemed without end.    The soldiers kept up a continual run of conversation, Jack catching enough  to know that the Chilian forces were gaining successes wherever they met  the Peruvians. He also learned that the army of Bolivia was now their  greatest concern, and that the latter was then on a march over the Andes  to meet them.    At nightfall a halt was made under a spur of the mountains, but before the  sun had tipped with gold the crest of the distant Andes the weary journey  was resumed.    That day about noon they came in sight of a little up-country town, which  the prisoners soon learned was known as Santa Rosilla. Its long, narrow  streets bore a deserted appearance, save for the motley-coated soldiers  passing to and fro, as if on guard.    The town bore every sign of a recent siege, while the indications were as  strong that the inhabitants had been completely routed and killed or  driven back into the mountains by their conquerors.    Straight down the grand plaza marched the soldiers with their captives,  making their way toward the casa consistorial, or town house, above which  flapped in the sleepy breeze the flag of Chili.    The door of the town house, which bore the marks of many bullets, was off  its hinges, but the rooms within were secure enough for all prisoners of  war that might fall into their hands in that isolated district, and  thither our twain were marched.    To their delight, which they were careful to conceal, they were put into a  room together, though under a strong guard.    \"Looks so we were in for it,\" said Plum, after they had been left by  themselves for an hour or more.    \"It was a hard set-back to my plans,\" said Jack.    \"I wonder what they will do with us,\" ventured Plum, expressing the  thought uppermost in our hero's mind.    \"From what I have overheard I should judge we were likely to be shot at  the first opportunity.\"    \"'Pears to me you're mighty cool about it. Will they dare to shoot us? We  are not mixed up in their war, and it might make trouble for them in in  the end, if I know anything.\"    \"They don't stop to consider that. It is my opinion they would dare to do  anything but meet an equal number of the enemy. It looks bad for us,  Plum.\"    \"I wonder if we can't dig out of here somehow? These walls don't seem so  awful thick.\"    \"Of course we must try and get out of this. The first thing to do will be  to free our limbs. Can you loosen your bonds any?\"    For the next ten minutes the boys were busy trying to free their hands  from the ligatures which had been fastened in no uncertain way.    \"It's no use,\" acknowledged Plum at last. \"I believe mine grow tighter and  tighter. Hark! I should think that soldier on guard in the hall would get  tired of that everlasting tramping back and forth. I've a mind to tell him  to stop.\"    \"Better not do it. I wonder if by standing on my shoulder you could look  out of that window up there?\"    \"I have been thinking that same thing. Let's try it.\"    Naturally their attention had been attracted to a small window, which  afforded light and ventilation for the room, but which was about ten feet  from the floor.    Tied hands and feet, as they were, the boys tried many times to carry out  their plan without avail, until it must have been near midnight when Plum  said:    \"It's mighty aggravating. There must be lights on the streets, for I've  seen their flash.\"    \"Let's try once more. If I lie down perhaps you can get on my neck, after  which I believe I can raise you to the window.\"    This proved a most difficult feat, but after repeated attempts Plum  succeeded in gaining the desired position, when Jack slowly straightened  up, until he had brought his companion's head on a level with the window,  where by leaning against the wall he was enabled to hold him for a hasty  look over the scene without.    Plum had barely gained his unsteady perch before he exclaimed in a tone of  excitement:    \"Oh, Jack! the town is on fire! Everything is burning up!\"    At that moment the dull boom of a cannon reached their ears.          Chapter XIX    Chilians on Both Sides        \"Looks as if the old town was being raided by some enemy,\" declared Plum,  after a short pause, during which another peal of the distant cannon awoke  far and wide the dismal night.    Loud cries were now heard outside the town house, making the youths'  situation one of excitement. In the hall adjoining their prison the steady  tramp of the sentry's feet had suddenly ceased.    \"How about the fire?\" asked Jack, bracing himself more firmly against the  wall under the weight of his companion.    Boom! boom! boom! rang sullenly on the scene before Plum could reply, and  then the rattle of musketry succeeded and the hoarse shouts of men giving  orders such as no one could understand in the wild confusion.    \"The fire lifts higher and higher,\" said Plum, as soon as a lull in the  tumult allowed him to be heard by his companion. \"It seems to be burning  on the northeast corner of the town, and the wind is driving it down this  way like a race horse. The plaza is full of soldiers.\"    The cannonade soon became almost continual, and was fairly deafening.    \"What will become of us?\" asked Plum, showing his first sign of  hopelessness.    \"Is the window large enough to let us crawl out if our hands were free?\"  asked Jack.    \"It may be; but it is crossed with bars of iron no man could break with  his hands.\"    \"Take your last look and then come down.\"    Plum took a hurried survey"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#15)"],[1," front of himself as if needing no further explanation.  \"This gentleman - may I introduce you?\" - (the man gave his permission  with a wave of the hand) - \"so, this gentleman's job is to give out  information.  He gives all the information they need to people who are  waiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the  public he gets asked for quite a lot.  He has an answer for every  question, you can try him out if you feel like it.  But that's not his  only distinction, his other distinction is his elegance of dress.  We,  that's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that  the information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he  continually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they  meet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression.  The rest of us  I'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly and  old-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes  anyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here.  But,  as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice  clothes.  As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and  they would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigants  contributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some others  besides.  So everything would be ready for him to give a good  impression, except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening  people.\"  \"That's how it is,\" said the man, mocking her, \"but I don't  understand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to  the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as  I'm sure he's not all interested.  Just look at him sitting there, it's  clear he's occupied with his own affairs.\"  K. just did not feel like  contradicting him. The girl's intention may have been good, perhaps she  was under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to  collect himself, but the attempt had not worked.  \"I had to explain to  him why you were laughing,\" said the girl.  \"I suppose it was  insulting.\"  \"I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally  took him outside.\"  K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated  the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what  suited him best.  But suddenly he felt the information-giver's hand on  one arm and the young woman's hand on the other.  \"Up you get then,  weakling,\" said the information-giver.  \"Thank you both very much,\" said  K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided these  unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support.  As they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, \"I  must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in  a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the  truth.  He isn't hard-hearted.  It's not really his job to help  litigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can  see.  I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like  to be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to  give the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone.  It makes me quite sad.\"  \"Would you not like to sit down here a while?\"  asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just  in front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier.  K. felt almost  ashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of  him and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by  the information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was  dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead.  But the  defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood  there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for  being there. The information-giver looked past him.  \"I know,\" he said,  \"that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,  I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've  got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here.\"  \"There's no  need to be so apologetic,\" said the information-giver, \"it's very  commendable for you to be so attentive.  You are taking up space here  when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do  nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as  you like.  When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their  cases one learns to show patience with people like you.   Do sit down.\"  \"He's very good with the litigants,\" whispered the girl.  K. nodded, but  started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, \"Would  you not like to sit down here a while?\"  \"No,\" said K., \"I don't want to  rest.\"  He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact it  would have done him a lot of good to sit down.  It was as if he were  suffering sea-sickness.  He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea,  as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from  the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as  if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of  it rising and sinking.  It made the calmness of the girl and the man  leading him all the more incomprehensible.  He was at their mercy, if  they let go of him he would fall like a board.  Their little eyes  glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but  could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being  carried.  He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not  understand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and  through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding,  like a siren.  \"Louder,\" he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at  having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly  enough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible.  At last, a  draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in  the wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, \"First  he says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that  this is the way out and he doesn't move.\"  K. became aware that he was  standing in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened  the door.  It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at  once, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of  the stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him.  \"Thank you very much,\" he repeated, shook their hands once more and did  not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the  comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to  the air in the offices.  They were hardly able to reply, and the young  woman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely  fast.  K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of  a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the  information-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down  the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his  previous state nearly frightened him.  His normally sturdy state of  health had never prepared him for surprises such as this.  Did his body  want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one  with such little effort?  He did not quite reject the idea that he  should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did  - and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to  spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.          Chapter Four  Miss Buerstner's Friend            For some time after this, K. found it impossible to exchange even  just a few words with Miss Buerstner.  He tried to reach her in many and  various ways but she always found a way to avoid it.  He would come  straight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on,  and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch  on the empty hallway.  If the maid went by and closed the door of the  apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again.  He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might  perhaps find Miss Buerstner alone as she went to the office.  But none of  these efforts brought any success.  Then he wrote her a letter, both to  the office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour,  offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross  whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance  to speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything  with Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Buerstner, he  finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room  all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his  request being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why  she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever  stipulations she might make.  The letters were not returned, but there  was no answer either.  However, on the following Sunday there was a sign  that seemed clear enough.  It was still early when K. noticed, through  the keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway  which soon abated.  A French teacher, although she was German and called  Montag, a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously  occupied a room of her own, was moving into Miss Buerstner's room.  She  could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there was  always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had  forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home.
