Mr. Waterhouse has built an elaborate  Congregational church at Hampstead, which shows the use with which such  effects of color may be obtained in interiors, and has kindly lent some  drawings. Mr. Pearson's church at Kilburn may also be referred to as a  fine example of brick vaulting. Brick and terra cotta seem to have a  natural affinity for one another. Terra cotta is no more than a refined  brick, made of the same sort of material, only in every respect more  carefully, and kiln baked. Its similarity to brick is such that there is  no sense of incongruity if moulded or carved brickwork and terra cotta  are both employed in the same building, and this can hardly be said to  be the case if the attempt is made to combine ornamental brickwork and  stone ornaments.    At South Kensington, a whole group of examples of brickwork with terra  cotta meet us. The Natural History Museum, the finest of them all, is  hardly fit for our present purpose, as it is as completely encased in  terra cotta as the fronts of the buildings in this avenue are in stone.  But here are the Albert Hall, a fine specimen of mass and effect; the  City and Guilds Institute; the College of Music, and some private houses  and blocks of flats, all in red brick with terra cotta, and all showing  the happy manner in which the two materials can be blended. In most of  them there is a contrast of color; but Mr. Waterhouse, in the Technical  Institute, has employed red terra cotta with red bricks, as he also has  done in his fine St. Paul's School at Hammersmith, and Mr. Norman Shaw  has, in his fine pile of buildings in St. James' street. This  combination--namely, brick and terra cotta--I look upon as the best for  withstanding the London climate, and for making full use of the  capabilities of brickwork that can be employed, and I have no doubt that  in the future it will be frequently resorted to. Some of those examples  also show the introduction of cast ornaments, and others the employment  of carving as means of enriching the surface of brick walls with  excellent effect. Here we must leave the subject; but in closing, I  cannot forbear pointing to the art of the bricklayer as a fine example  of what may be accomplished by steady perseverance. Every brick in the  miles of viaducts or tunnels, houses, or public buildings, to which we  have made allusion, was laid separately, and it is only steady  perseverance, brick after brick, on the part of the bricklayer, which  could have raised these great masses of work. Let me add that no one  brick out of the many laid is of no importance. Some time ago a great  fire occurred in a public asylum, and about L2,000 of damage was done,  and the lives of many of the inmates endangered. When the origin of this  fire came to be traced out, it was found that it was due to one brick  being left out in a flue. A penny would be a high estimate of the cost  of that brick and of the expense of laying it, yet through the neglect  of that pennyworth, L2,000 damage was done, and risk of human life was  run. I think there is a moral in this story which each of us can make  out if he will.           *       *       *       *       *    A fireproof whitewash can be readily made by adding one part silicate of  soda (or potash) to every five parts of whitewash. The addition of a  solution of alum to whitewash is recommended as a means to prevent the  rubbing off of the wash. A coating of a good glue size made by  dissolving half a pound of glue in a gallon of water is employed when  the wall is to be papered.           *       *       *       *       *          PHENOMENA OF ALTERNATING CURRENTS.    [Footnote: From a paper read before the recent meeting of the American  Institute of Electrical Engineers, New York, and reported in the  _Electrical World_.]    By Prof. ELIHU THOMSON.      The actions produced and producible by the agency of alternating  currents of considerable energy are assuming greater importance in the  electric arts. I mean, of course, by the term alternating currents,  currents of electricity reversed at frequent intervals, so that a  positive flow is succeeded by a negative flow, and that again by a  positive flow, such reversals occurring many times in a second, so that  the curve of current of electromotive force will, if plotted, be a wave  line, the amplitude of which is the arithmetical sum of the positive and  negative maxima of current or electromotive force, as the case may be,  while a horizontal middle line joins the zero points of current or  electromotive force.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    It is well known that such a current passing in a coil or conductor laid  parallel with or in inductive relation to a second coil or conductor,  will induce in the second conductor, if on open circuit, alternating  electromotive forces, and that if its terminals be closed or joined,  alternating currents of the same rhythm, period, or pitch, will  circulate in the second conductor. This is the action occurring in any  induction coil whose primary wire is traversed by alternating currents,  and whose secondary wire is closed either upon itself directly or  through a resistance. What I desire to draw attention to in the present  paper are the mechanical actions of attraction and repulsion which will  be exhibited between the two conductors, and the novel results which may  be obtained by modifications in the relative dispositions of the two  conductors.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    In 1884, while preparing for the International Electrical Exhibition at  Philadelphia, we had occasion to construct a large electro-magnet, the  cores of which were about six inches in diameter and about twenty inches  long. They were made of bundles of iron rod of about 5/16 inch diameter.  When complete, the magnet was energized by the current of a dynamo  giving continuous currents, and it exhibited the usual powerful magnetic  effects. It was found also that a disk of sheet copper, of about 1/16  inch thickness and 10 inches in diameter, if dropped flat against a pole  of the magnet, would settle down softly upon it, being retarded by the  development of currents in the disk due to its movement in a strong  magnetic field, and which currents were of opposite direction to those  in the coils of the magnet. In fact, it was impossible to strike the  magnet pole a sharp blow with the disk, even when the attempt was made  by holding one edge of the disk in the hand and bringing it down  forcibly toward the magnet. In attempting to raise the disk quickly off  the pole, a similar but opposite action of resistance to movement took  place, showing the development of currents in the same direction to  those in the coils of the magnet, and which currents, of course, would  cause attraction as a result.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    The experiment was, however, varied, as in Fig. 1. The disk, D, was held  over the magnet pole, as shown, and the current in the magnet coils cut  off by shunting them. There was felt an attraction of the disk or a dip  toward the pole. The current was then put on by opening the shunting  switch, and a repulsive action or lift of the disk was felt. The actions  just described are what would be expected in such a case, for when  attraction took place, currents had been induced in the disk, D, in the  same direction as those in the magnet coils beneath it, and when  repulsion took place the induced current in the disk was of opposite  character or direction to that in the coils.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    Now let us imagine the current in the magnet coils to be not only cut  off, but reversed back and forth.    For the reasons just given, we will find that the disk, D, is attracted  and repelled alternately; for, whenever the currents induced in it are  of the same direction with those in the inducing or magnet coil,  attraction will ensue, and when they are opposite in direction,  repulsion will be produced. Moreover, the repulsion will be produced  when the current in the magnet coil is rising to a maximum in either  direction, and attraction will be the result when the current of either  direction is falling to zero, since in the former case opposite currents  are induced in the disk, D, in accordance with well known laws, and in  the latter case currents of the same direction will exist in the disk,  D, and the magnet coil. The disk might, of course, be replaced by a ring  of copper or other good conductor, or by a closed coil of bare or  insulated wire, or by a series of disks, rings or coils superposed, and  the results would be the same. Thus far, indeed, we have nothing of a  particularly novel character, and, doubtless, other experimenters have  made very similar experiments and noted similar results to those  described.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    The account just given of the effects produced by alternating currents,  while true, is not the whole truth, and just here we may supplement it  by the following statements:    _An alternating current circuit or coil repels and attracts a closed  circuit or coil placed in direct or magnetic inductive relation  therewith; but the repulsive effect is in excess of the attractive  effect.    When the closed circuit or coil is so placed, and is of such low  resistance metal that a comparatively large current can circulate as an  induced current, so as to be subject to a large self-induction, the  repulsive far exceeds the attractive effort_.    For want of a better name, I shall call this excess of repulsive effect  the \"electro-inductive repulsion\" of the coils or circuits.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    This preponderating repulsive effect may be utilized or may show its  presence by producing movement or pressure in a given direction, by  producing angular deflection as of a pivoted body, or by producing  continuous rotation with a properly organized structure. Some of the  simple devices realizing the conditions I will now describe.

(1)    Now Sigurd rides away; many-folded is his shield, and blazing with red  gold, and the image of a dragon is drawn thereon; and this same was dark  brown above, and bright red below; and with even such-like image was  adorned helm, and saddle, and coat-armour; and he was clad in the golden  byrny, and all his weapons were gold wrought.    Now for this cause was the drake drawn on all his weapons, that when he  was seen of men, all folk might know who went there; yea, all those who  had heard of his slaying of that great dragon, that the Voerings call  Fafnir; and for that cause are his weapons gold-wrought, and brown  of hue, and that he was by far above other men in courtesy and goodly  manners, and well-nigh in all things else; and whenas folk tell of all  the mightiest champions, and the noblest chiefs, then ever is he named  the foremost, and his name goes wide about on all tongues north of the  sea of the Greek-lands, and even so shall it be while the world endures.    Now the hair of this Sigurd was golden-red of hue, fair of fashion, and  falling down in great locks; thick and short was his beard, and of no  other colour, high-nosed he was, broad and high-boned of face; so  keen were his eyes, that few durst gaze up under the brows of him; his  shoulders were as broad to look on as the shoulders of two; most duly  was his body fashioned betwixt height and breadth, and in such wise as  was seemliest; and this is the sign told of his height, that when he was  girt with his sword Gram, which same was seven spans long, as he went  through the full-grown rye-fields, the dew-shoe of the said sword smote  the ears of the standing corn; and, for all that, greater was his  strength than his growth: well could he wield sword, and cast forth  spear, shoot shaft, and hold shield, bend bow, back horse, and do all  the goodly deeds that he learned in his youth's days.    Wise he was to know things yet undone; and the voice of all fowls he  knew, wherefore few things fell on him unawares.    Of many words he was, and so fair of speech withal, that whensoever he  made it his business to speak, he never left speaking before that to all  men it seemed full sure, that no otherwise must the matter be than as he  said.    His sport and pleasure it was to give aid to his own folk, and to prove  himself in mighty matters, to take wealth from his unfriends, and give  the same to his friends.    Never did he lose heart, and of naught was he adrad.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  This chapter is nearly literally the same as chapter 166 of         the \"Wilkinasaga\"; Ed.: Perinskiold, Stockholm, 1715.        CHAPTER XXIII. Sigurd comes to Hlymdale.    Forth Sigurd rides till he comes to a great and goodly dwelling, the  lord whereof was a mighty chief called Heimir; he had to wife a sister  of Brynhild, who was hight Bekkhild, because she had bidden at home, and  learned handicraft, whereas Brynhild fared with helm and byrny unto the  wars, wherefore was she called Brynhild.    Heimir and Bekkhild had a son called Alswid, the most courteous of men.    Now at this stead were men disporting them abroad, but when they see  the man riding thereto, they leave their play to wonder at him, for none  such had they ever seen erst; so they went to meet him, and gave him  good welcome; Alswid bade him abide and have such things at his hands as  he would; and he takes his bidding blithesomely; due service withal was  established for him; four men bore the treasure of gold from off the  horse, and the fifth took it to him to guard the same; therein were many  things to behold, things of great price, and seldom seen; and great  game and joy men had to look on byrnies and helms, and mighty rings, and  wondrous great golden stoups, and all kinds of war weapons.    So there dwelt Sigurd long in great honour holden; and tidings of that  deed of fame spread wide through all lands, of how he had slain that  hideous and fearful dragon. So good joyance had they there together,  and each was leal to other; and their sport was in the arraying of  their weapons, and the shafting of their arrows, and the flying of their  falcons.        CHAPTER XXIV. Sigurd sees Brynhild at Hlymdale.    In those days came home to Heimir, Brynhild, his foster-daughter,  and she sat in her bower with her maidens, and could more skill in  handycraft than other women; she sat, overlaying cloth with gold, and  sewing therein the great deeds which Sigurd had wrought, the slaying of  the Worm, and the taking of the wealth of him, and the death of Regin  withal.    Now tells the tale, that on a day Sigurd rode into the wood with hawk,  and hound, and men thronging; and whenas he came home his hawk flew up  to a high tower, and sat him down on a certain window. Then fared Sigurd  after his hawk, and he saw where sat a fair woman, and knew that it was  Brynhild, and he deems all things he sees there to be worthy together,  both her fairness, and the fair things she wrought: and therewith he  goes into the hall, but has no more joyance in the games of the men  folk.    Then spake Alswid, \"Why art thou so bare of bliss? this manner of thine  grieveth us thy friends; why then wilt thou not hold to thy gleesome  ways? Lo, thy hawks pine now, and thy horse Grani droops; and long will  it be ere we are booted thereof?\"    Sigurd answered, \"Good friend, hearken to what lies on my mind; for my  hawk flew up into a certain tower; and when I came thereto and took him,  lo there I saw a fair woman, and she sat by a needlework of gold, and  did thereon my deeds that are passed, and my deeds that are to come.\"    Then said Alswid, \"Thou has seen Brynhild, Budli's daughter, the  greatest of great women.\"    \"Yea, verily,\" said Sigurd; \"but how came she hither?\"    Aswid answered, \"Short space there was betwixt the coming hither of the  twain of you.\"    Says Sigurd, \"Yea, but a few days agone I knew her for the best of the  world's women.\"    Alswid said, \"Give not all thine heed to one woman, being such a man as  thou art; ill life to sit lamenting for what we may not have.\"    \"I shall go meet her,\" says Sigurd, \"and get from her love like my love,  and give her a gold ring in token thereof.\"    Alswid answered, \"None has ever yet been known whom she would let sit  beside her, or to whom she would give drink; for ever will she hold to  warfare and to the winning of all kinds of fame.\"    Sigurd said, \"We know not for sure whether she will give us answer or  not, or grant us a seat beside her.\"    So the next day after, Sigurd went to the bower, but Alswid stood  outside the bower door, fitting shafts to his arrows.    Now Sigurd spake, \"Abide, fair and hale lady,--how farest thou?\"    She answered, \"Well it fares; my kin and my friends live yet: but who  shall say what goodhap folk may bear to their life's end?\"    He sat him down by her, and there came in four damsels with great golden  beakers, and the best of wine therein; and these stood before the twain.    Then said Brynhild, \"This seat is for few, but and if my father come.\"    He answered, \"Yet is it granted to one that likes me well.\"    Now that chamber was hung with the best and fairest of hangings, and the  floor thereof was all covered with cloth.    Sigurd spake, \"Now has it come to pass even as thou didst promise.\"    \"O be thou welcome here!\" said she, and arose therewith, and the four  damsels with her, and bore the golden beaker to him, and bade him drink;  he stretched out his hand to the beaker, and took it, and her hand  withal, and drew her down beside him; and cast his arms round about her  neck and kissed her, and said--    \"Thou art the fairest that was ever born!\"    But Brynhild said, \"Ah, wiser is it not to cast faith and troth into a  woman's power, for ever shall they break that they have promised.\"    He said, \"That day would dawn the best of days over our heads whereon  each of each should be made happy.\"    Brynhild answered, \"It is not fated that we should abide together; I am  a shield-may, and wear helm on head even as the kings of war, and them  full oft I help, neither is the battle become loathsome to me.\"    Sigurd answered, \"What fruit shall be of our life, if we live not  together: harder to bear this pain that lies hereunder, than the stroke  of sharp sword.\"    Brynhild answers, \"I shall gaze on the hosts of the war-kings, but thou  shalt wed Gudrun, the daughter of Giuki.\"    Sigurd answered, \"What king's daughter lives to beguile me? neither am  I double-hearted herein; and now I swear by the Gods that thee shall I  have for mine own, or no woman else.\"    And even suchlike wise spake she.    Sigurd thanked her for her speech, and gave her a gold ring, and now  they swore oath anew, and so he went his ways to his men, and is with  them awhile in great bliss.        CHAPTER XXV. Of the Dream of Gudrun, Giuki's daughter.    There was a king hight Giuki, who ruled a realm south of the Rhine;  three sons he had, thus named: Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm, and Gudrun  was the name of his daughter, the fairest of maidens; and all these  children were far before all other king's children in all prowess, and  in goodliness and growth withal; ever were his sons at the wars  and wrought many a deed of fame. But Giuki had wedded Grimhild the  Wise-wife.    Now Budli was the name of a king mightier than Giuki, mighty though they  both were: and Atli was the brother of Brynhild: Atli was a fierce man  and a grim, great and black to look on, yet noble of mien withal, and  the greatest of warriors. Grimhild was a fierce-hearted woman.    Now the days of the Giukings bloomed fair, and chiefly because of those  children, so far before the sons of men.    On a day Gudrun says to her mays that she may have no joy of heart; then  a certain woman asked her wherefore her joy was departed.    She answered, \"Grief came to me in my dreams, therefore is there sorrow  in my heart, since thou must needs ask thereof.\"    \"T"]]]
