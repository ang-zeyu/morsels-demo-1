'Let's sprint.' They  sprinted, and arrived at the door of the cottage with scarcely a yard  between them, much to the admiration of the Oldest Inhabitant, who was  smoking a thoughtful pipe in his front garden. Mrs Oldest Inhabitant  came out of the cottage at the sound of voices, and Charteris broached  the subject of tea. The menu was sumptuous and varied, and even the  Babe, in spite of his devotion to strict training, could scarce forbear  to smile happily at the mention of hot cakes.    During the _mauvais quart d'heure_ before the meal, Charteris kept  up an animated conversation with the Oldest Inhabitant, the Babe  joining in from time to time when he could think of anything to say.  Charteris appeared to be quite a friend of the family. He enquired  after the Oldest Inhabitant's rheumatics. It was gratifying to find  that they were distinctly better. How had Mrs O. I. been since his last  visit? Prarper hearty? Excellent. How was the O. I.'s nevvy?    At the mention of his nevvy the O. I. became discursive. He told his  audience everything that had happened in connection with the said nevvy  for years back. After which he started to describe what he would  probably do in the future. Amongst other things, there were going to be  some sports at Rutton today week, and his nevvy was going to try and  win the cup for what the Oldest Inhabitant vaguely described as 'a  race'. He had won it last year. Yes, prarper good runner, his nevvy.  Where was Rutton? the Babe wanted to know. About eight miles out of  Stapleton, said Charteris, who was well up in local geography. You got  there by train. It was the next station.    Mrs O. I. came out to say that tea was ready, and, being drawn into the  conversation on the subject of the Rutton sports, produced a programme  of the same, which her nevvy had sent them. From this it seemed that  the nevvy's 'spot' event was the egg and spoon race. An asterisk  against his name pointed him out as the last year's winner.    'Hullo,' said Charteris, 'I see there's a strangers' mile. I'm a demon  at the mile when I'm roused. I think I shall go in for it.'    He handed the programme back and began his tea.    'You know, Babe,' he said, as they were going back that evening, 'I  really think I shall go in for that race. It would be a most awful rag.  It's the day before the House-match, so it'll just get me fit.'    'Don't be a fool,' said the Babe. 'There would be a fearful row about  it if you were found out. You'd get extras for the rest of your life.'    'Well, the final Houser comes off on a Thursday, so it won't affect  that.'    'Yes, but still--'    'I shall think about it,' said Charteris. 'You needn't go telling  anyone.'    'If you'll take my advice, you'll drop it.'    'Your suggestion has been noted, and will receive due attention,' said  Charteris. 'Put on the pace a bit.'    They lengthened their stride, and conversation came to an abrupt end.        _Chapter 4_    'I shall go, Babe,' said Charteris on the following night.    The Sixth Form had a slack day before them on the morrow, there being a  temporary lull in the form-work which occurred about once a week, when  there was no composition of any kind to be done. The Sixth did four  compositions a week, two Greek and two Latin, and except for these did  not bother themselves very much about overnight preparation. The Latin  authors which the form were doing were Livy and Virgil, and when either  of these were on the next day's programme, most of the Sixth considered  that they were justified in taking a night off. They relied on their  ability to translate both authors at sight and without previous  acquaintance. The popular notion that Virgil is hard rarely appeals to  a member of a public school. There are two ways of translating Virgil,  the conscientious and the other. He prefers the other.    On this particular night, therefore, work was 'off'. Merevale was over  at the Great Hall, taking preparation, and the Sixth-Form Merevalians  had assembled in Charteris's study to talk about things in general. It  was after a pause of some moments, that had followed upon a lively  discussion of the House's prospects in the forthcoming final, that  Charteris had spoken.    'I shall go, Babe,' said he.    'Go where?' asked Tony, from the depths of a deck-chair.    'Babe knows.'    The Babe turned to the company and explained.    'The lunatic's going in for the strangers' mile at some sports at  Rutton next week. He'll get booked for a cert. He can't see that. I  never saw such a man.'    'Rally round,' said Charteris, 'and reason with me. I'll listen. Tony,  what do you think about it?'    Tony expressed his opinion tersely, and Charteris thanked him. Welch,  who had been reading, now awoke to the fact that a discussion was in  progress, and asked for details. The Babe explained once more, and  Welch heartily corroborated Tony's remarks. Charteris thanked him too.    'You aren't really going, are you?' asked Welch.    'Rather,' said Charteris.    'The Old Man won't give you leave.'    'Shan't worry the poor man with such trifles.'    'But it's miles out of bounds. Stapleton station is out of bounds to  start with. It's against rules to go in a train, and Rutton's even more  out of bounds than Stapleton.'    'And as there are sports there,' said Tony, 'the Old Man is certain to  put Rutton specially out of bounds for that day. He always bars a St  Austin's chap going to a place when there's anything going on there.'    'I don't care. What have I to do with the Old Man's petty prejudices?  Now, let me get at my time-table. Here we are. Now then.'    'Don't be a fool,' said Tony,    'Certainly not. Look here, there's a train starts from Stapleton at  three. I can catch that all right. Gets to Rutton at three-twenty.  Sports begin at three-fifteen. At least, they are supposed to. Over  before five, I should think. At least, my race will be, though I must  stop to see the Oldest Inhabitant's nevvy win the egg and spoon canter.  But that ought to come on before the strangers' race. Train back at a  quarter past five. Arrives at a quarter to six. Lock up six-fifteen.  That gives me half an hour to get here from Stapleton. What more do you  want? I shall do it easily, and ... the odds against my being booked  are about twenty-five to one. At which price if any gent present cares  to deposit his money, I am willing to take him. Now I'll treat you to a  tune, if you're good.'    He went to the cupboard and produced his gramophone. Charteris's  musical instruments had at one time been strictly suppressed by the  authorities, and, in consequence, he had laid in a considerable stock  of them. At last, when he discovered that there was no rule against the  use of musical instruments in the House, Merevale had yielded. The  stipulation that Charteris should play only before prep. was rigidly  observed, except when Merevale was over at the Hall, and the Sixth had  no work. On such occasions Charteris felt justified in breaking through  the rule. He had a gramophone, a banjo, a penny whistle, and a mouth  organ. The banjo, which he played really well, was the most in request,  but the gramophone was also popular.    'Turn on \"Whistling Rufus\",' observed Thomson.    'Whistling Rufus' was duly turned on, giving way after an encore to  'Bluebells'.    'I always weep when I hear this,' said Tony.    'It _is_ beautiful, isn't it?' said Charteris.        I'll be your sweetheart, if you--will be--mine,      All my life, I'll be your valentine.      Bluebells I've gathered--grrhhrh.    The needle of the gramophone, after the manner of its kind, slipped  raspingly over the surface of the wax, and the rest of the ballad was  lost.    'That,' said Charteris, 'is how I feel with regard to the Old Man. I'd  be his sweetheart, if he'd be mine. But he makes no advances, and the  stain on my scutcheon is not yet wiped out. I must say I haven't tried  gathering bluebells for him yet, nor have I offered my services as a  perpetual valentine, but I've been very kind to him in other ways.'    'Is he still down on you?' asked the Babe.    'He hasn't done much lately. We're in a state of truce at present. Did  I tell you how I scored about Stapleton?'    'You've only told us about a hundred times,' said the Babe brutally. 'I  tell you what, though, he'll score off you if he finds you going to  Rutton.'    'Let's hope he won't.'    'He won't,' said Welch suddenly.    'Why?'    'Because you won't go. I'll bet you anything you like that you won't  go.'    That settled Charteris. It was the sort of remark that always acted on  him like a tonic. He had been intending to go all the time, but it was  this speech of Welch's that definitely clinched the matter. One of his  mottoes for everyday use was 'Let not thyself be scored off by Welch.'    'That's all right,' he said. 'Of course I shall go. What's the next  item you'd like on this machine?'    The day of the sports arrived, and the Babe, meeting Charteris at  Merevale's gate, made a last attempt to head him off from his purpose.    'How are you going to take your things?' he asked. 'You can't carry a  bag. The first beak you met would ask questions.'    If he had hoped that this would be a crushing argument, he was  disappointed.    Charteris patted a bloated coat pocket.    'Bags,' he said laconically. 'Vest,' he added, doing the same to his  other pocket. 'Shoes,' he concluded, 'you will observe I am carrying in  a handy brown paper parcel, and if anybody wants to know what's in it,  I shall tell them it's acid drops. Sure you won't come, too?'    'Quite, thanks.'    'All right. So long then. Be good while I'm gone.'    And he passed on down the road that led to Stapleton.    The Rutton Recreation Ground presented, as the _Stapleton Herald_  justly remarked in its next week's issue, 'a gay and animated "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#15)"],[1," unless he were quite out of form, would win  the long jump, and the majority of the other events had already been  decided. The gem of the afternoon would be the mile, for not even the  shrewdest judge of form could say whether Jim would beat Drake, or  Drake Jim. Both had done equally good times in practice, and both were  known to be in the best of training. The adherents of Jim pointed to  the fact that he had won the half off Drake--by a narrow margin, true,  but still he had won it. The other side argued that a half-mile is no  criterion for a mile, and that if Drake had timed his sprint better he  would probably have won, for he had finished up far more strongly than  his opponent. And so on the subject of the mile, public opinion was for  once divided.    The field was nearly full by this time. The only clear space outside  the ropes was where the Headmaster stood to greet and talk about the  weather to such parents and guardians and other celebrities as might  pass. This habit of his did not greatly affect the unattached members  of the School, those whose parents lived in distant parts of the world  and were not present on Sports Day, but to St Jones Brown (for  instance) of the Lower Third, towing Mr Brown, senior, round the ring,  it was a nervous ordeal to have to stand by while his father and the  Head exchanged polite commonplaces. He could not help feeling that  there was _just a chance_ (horrible thought) that the Head,  searching for something to say, might seize upon that little matter of  broken bounds or shaky examination papers as a subject for discussion.  He was generally obliged, when the interview was over, to conduct his  parent to the shop by way of pulling his system together again, the  latter, of course, paying.    At intervals round the ropes Old Austinian number one was meeting Old  Austinian number two (whom he emphatically detested, and had hoped to  avoid), and was conversing with him in a nervous manner, the clearness  of his replies being greatly handicapped by a feeling, which grew with  the minutes, that he would never be able to get rid of him and go in  search of Old Austinian number three, his bosom friend.    At other intervals, present Austinians of tender years were manoeuvring  half-companies of sisters, aunts, and mothers, and trying without much  success to pretend that they did not belong to them. A pretence which  came down heavily when one of the aunts addressed them as 'Willie' or  'Phil', and wanted to know audibly if 'that boy who had just passed'  (_the_ one person in the School whom they happened to hate and  despise) was their best friend. It was a little trying, too, to have to  explain in the middle of a crowd that the reason why you were not  running in 'that race' (the 'under thirteen' hundred, by Jove, which  ought to have been a gift to you, only, etc.) was because you had been  ignominiously knocked out in the trial heats.    In short, the afternoon wore on. Welch won the hundred by two yards and  the quarter by twenty, and the other events fell in nearly every case  to the favourite. The hurdles created something of a surprise--Jackson,  who ought to have won, coming down over the last hurdle but two,  thereby enabling Dallas to pull off an unexpected victory by a couple  of yards. Vaughan's enthusiastic watch made the time a little under  sixteen seconds, but the official timekeeper had other views. There  were no instances of the timid new boy, at whom previously the world  had scoffed, walking away with the most important race of the day.    And then the spectators were roused from a state of coma by the sound  of the bell ringing for the mile. Old Austinian number one gratefully  seized the opportunity to escape from Old Austinian number two, and  lose himself in the crowd. Young Pounceby-Green with equal gratitude  left his father talking to the Head, and shot off without ceremony to  get a good place at the ropes. In fact, there was a general stir of  anticipation, and all round the ring paterfamilias was asking his son  and heir which was Drake and which Thomson, and settling his glasses  more firmly on the bridge of his nose.    The staff of _The Glow Worm_ conducted Jim to the starting-place,  and did their best to relieve his obvious nervousness with light  conversation.    'Eh, old chap?' said Jim. He had been saying 'Eh?' to everything  throughout the afternoon.    'I said, \"Is my hat on straight, and does it suit the colour of my  eyes?\"' said Charteris.    'Oh, yes. Yes, rather. Ripping,' in a far-off voice.    'And have you a theory of the Universe?'    'Eh, old chap?'    'I said, \"Did you want your legs rubbed before you start?\" I believe  it's an excellent specific for the gout.'    'Gout? What? No, I don't think so, thanks.'    'And you'll write to us sometimes, Jim, and give my love to little  Henry, and _always_ wear flannel next your skin, my dear boy?'  said Charteris.    This seemed to strike even Jim as irrelevant.    'Do shut up for goodness  sake, Alderman,' he said irritably. 'Why can't you go and rag somebody  else?'    'My place is by your side. Go, my son, or else they'll be starting  without you. Give us your blazer. And take my tip, the tip of an old  runner, and don't pocket your opponent's ball in your own twenty-five.  And come back victorious, or on the shields of your soldiers. All  right, sir (to the starter), he's just making his will. Good-bye Jim.  Buck up, or I'll lynch you after the race.'    Jim answered by muffling him in his blazer, and walking to the line.  There were six competitors in all, each of whom owned a name ranking  alphabetically higher than Thomson. Jim, therefore, had the outside  berth. Drake had the one next to the inside, which fell to Adamson, the  victim of the lost two pounds episode.    Both Drake and Jim got off well at the sound of the pistol, and the  pace was warm from the start. Jim evidently had his eye on the inside  berth, and, after half a lap had been completed, he got it, Drake  falling back. Jim continued to make the running, and led at the end of  the first lap by about five yards. Then came Adamson, followed by a  batch of three, and finally Drake, taking things exceedingly coolly, a  couple of yards behind them. The distance separating him from Jim was  little over a dozen yards. A roar of applause greeted the runners as  they started on the second lap, and it was significant that while Jim's  supporters shouted, 'Well run', those of Drake were fain to substitute  advice for approval, and cry 'Go it'. Drake, however, had not the least  intention of 'going it' in the generally accepted meaning of the  phrase. A yard or two to the rear meant nothing in the first lap, and  he was running quite well enough to satisfy himself, with a nice,  springy stride, which he hoped would begin to tell soon.    With the end of the second lap the real business of the race began, for  the survival of the fittest had resulted in eliminations and changes of  order. Jim still led, but now by only eight or nine yards. Drake had  come up to second, and Adamson had dropped to a bad third. Two of the  runners had given the race up, and retired, and the last man was a long  way behind, and, to all practical purposes, out of the running. There  were only three laps, and, as the last lap began, the pace quickened,  fast as it had been before. Jim was exerting every particle of his  strength. He was not a runner who depended overmuch on his final dash.  He hoped to gain so much ground before Drake made his sprint as to  neutralize it when it came. Adamson he did not fear.    And now they were in the last two hundred yards, Jim by this time some  thirty yards ahead, but in great straits. Drake had quickened his pace,  and gained slowly on him. As they rounded the corner and came into the  straight, the cheers were redoubled. It was a great race. Then, fifty  yards from the tape, Drake began his final sprint. If he had saved  himself before, he made up for it now. The gap dwindled and dwindled.  Neither could improve his pace. It was a question whether there was  enough of the race left for Drake to catch his man, or whether he had  once more left his sprint till too late. Jim could hear the roars of  the spectators, and the frenzied appeals of Merevale's House to him to  sprint, but he was already doing his utmost. Everything seemed black to  him, a black, surging mist, and in its centre a thin white line, the  tape. Could he reach it before Drake? Or would he collapse before he  reached it? There were only five more yards to go now, and still he  led. Four. Three. Two. Then something white swept past him on the  right, the white line quivered, snapped, and vanished, and he pitched  blindly forward on to the turf at the track-side. Drake had won by a  foot.          [12]    AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW      For the rest of the afternoon Jim had a wretched time. To be beaten  after such a race by a foot, and to be beaten by a foot when victory  would have cut the Gordian knot of his difficulties once and for all,  was enough to embitter anybody's existence. He found it hard to accept  the well-meant condolences of casual acquaintances, and still harder to  do the right thing and congratulate Drake on his victory, a refinement  of self-torture which is by custom expected of the vanquished in every  branch of work or sport. But he managed it somehow, and he also managed  to appear reasonably gratified when he went up to take his prize for  the half-mile. Tony and the others, who knew what his defeat meant to  him, kept out of his way, for which he was grateful. After lock-up,  however, it was a different matter, but by that time he was more ready  for society. Even now there might be some way out of the difficulty. He  asked Tony's advice on the subject. Tony was perplexed. The situation  was beyond his grip.    'I don't see what you can do, Jim,' he said, 'unless the Rugby chap'll  be satisfied with "]]]
