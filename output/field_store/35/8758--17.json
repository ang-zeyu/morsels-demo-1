Guthrie's instructions as to how they should  find it read like a page from Poe's \"Gold Bug.\" You had to go at night  to a place where a lonely road crossed the Erie Railroad tracks in the  Hackensack meadows, and mark the spot where the shadow of a telegraph  pole (cast by an arc light) fell on a stone wall. This you must climb  and walk so many paces north, turn and go so many feet west, and then  north again. You then came to a white stone, from which you laid your  course through more latitude and longitude until you were right over the  spot. The police of Hoboken did as directed, and after tacking round and  round the field, found the dynamite. Of course, the union said the whole  thing was a plant, and that Guthrie had put the dynamite in the field  himself at the instigation of his employers, but before the case came to  trial both dynamiters pleaded guilty and went to Sing Sing. One of them  turned out to be an ex-convict, a burglar. I often wonder where Guthrie  is now. He certainly cared little for his life. Perhaps he is down in  Venezuela or Mexico. He could never be aught than a soldier of fortune.  But for a long time the employers thought that Guthrie was a detective  sent by the unions to compromise THEM in the very dynamiting they were  trying to stop!    I once had a particularly dangerous and unfortunate case where a private  client was being blackmailed by a half-crazy ruffian who had never seen  him, but had selected him arbitrarily as a person likely to give  up money. The blackmailer was a German Socialist, who was out of  employment--a man of desperate character. He had made up his mind that  the world owed him a living, and he had decided that the easiest way  to get it was to make some more prosperous person give him a thousand  dollars under threat of being exposed as an enemy of society.    The charge was so absurd as to be almost ludicrous, but had my client  caused the blackmailer's arrest the matter would have been the subject  of endless newspaper notoriety and comment. It was therefore thought  wise to make use of other means, and I procured the assistance of  a young German-American of my acquaintance, who, in the guise of  a vaudeville artist seeking a job, went to the blackmailer's  boarding-house and pretended to be looking for an actor friend with a  name not unlike that of the criminal.    After two or three visits he managed to scrape an acquaintance with the  blackmailer and thereafter spent much time with him. Both were out of  work, both were German, and both liked beer. My friend had just enough  money to satisfy this latter craving. In a month or so they were  intimate friends and used to go fishing together down the bay. At last,  after many months, the criminal disclosed to the detective his plan of  blackmailing my client, and suggested that as two heads were better than  one they had better make it a joint venture. The detective pretended to  balk at the idea at first, but was finally persuaded, and at the other's  request undertook the delivery of the blackmailing letters to my client!  Inside of three weeks he had in his possession enough evidence in the  criminal's own handwriting to send him to a prison for the rest of his  life. When at last the detective disclosed his identity the blackmailer  at first refused to believe him, and then literally rolled on the floor  in his agony and fear at discovering how he had been hoodwinked. The  next day he disappeared and has not been heard of since, but his letters  are in my vault, ready to be used if he again puts in an appearance.    The records of the police and of the private agencies contain many  instances where murderers have confessed their guilt long after the  crime to supposed friends, who were in reality decoys placed there for  that very purpose. It is a peculiarity of criminals that they cannot  keep their secrets locked in their own breasts. The impulse to  confession is universal, particularly in women. Egotism has some part in  this, but the chief element is the desire for companionship. Criminals  have a horror of dying under an alias. The dignity of identity appeals  even to the tramp. This impulse leads oftentimes to the most unnecessary  and suicidal disclosures. The murderer who has planned and executed a  diabolical homicide and who has retired to obscurity and safety will  very likely in course of time make a clean breast of it to some one whom  he believes to be his friend. He wants to \"get it off his chest,\" to  talk it over, to discuss its fine points, to boast of how clever he was,  to ask for unnecessary advice about his conduct in the future, to  have at least one other person in the world who has seen his soul's  nakedness.    The interesting feature of such confessions from a legal point of view  is that, no matter how circumstantial they may be, they are not usually  of themselves sufficient under our law to warrant a conviction. The  admission or confession of a defendant needs legal corroboration. This  corroboration is often very difficult to find, and frequently cannot be  secured at all. This provision of the statutes is doubtless a wise one  to prevent hysterical, suicidal, egotistical, and semi-insane persons  from meeting death in the electric chair or on the gallows, but it often  results in the guilty going unpunished. Personally, I have never known a  criminal to confess a crime of which he was innocent. The nearest thing  to it in my experience is when one criminal, jointly guilty with another  and sure of conviction, has drawn lots with his pal, lost, confessed,  and in the confession exculpated his companion.    In the police organization of almost every large city there are a few  men who are genuinely gifted for the work of detection. Such an one was  Guiseppe Petrosino, a great detective, and an honest, unselfish,  and heroic man, who united indefatigable patience and industry with  reasoning powers of a high order. The most thrilling evening of my life  was when I listened before a crackling fire in my library to Joe's  story of the Van Cortlandt Park murder, the night before I was going to  prosecute the case. Sitting stiffly in an arm-chair, his ugly moon-face  expressionless save for an occasional flash from his black eyes,  Petrosino recounted slowly and accurately how, by means of a single  slip of paper bearing the penciled name \"Sabbatto Gizzi, P.O. Box 239,  Lambertville, N.J.,\" he had run down the unknown murderer of an unknown  Italian stabbed to death in the park's shrubbery.    Petrosino's physical characteristics were so pronounced that he was  probably as widely, if not more widely, known than any other Italian  in New York. He was short and heavy, with enormous shoulders and a bull  neck, on which was placed a great round head like a summer squash. His  face was pock-marked, and he talked with a deliberation that was due to  his desire for accuracy, but which at times might have been suspected  to arise from some other cause. He rarely smiled and went methodically  about his business, which was to drive the Italian criminals out of the  city and country. Of course, being a marked man in more senses than one,  it was practically impossible to disguise himself, and, accordingly,  he had to rely upon his own investigations and detective powers,  supplemented by the efforts of the trained men in the Italian branch,  many of whom are detectives of a high order of ability. If the life of  Petrosino were to be written, it would be a book unique in the history  of criminology and crime, for this man was probably the only great  detective of the world to find his career in a foreign country amid  criminals of his own race.    I have instanced Petrosino as an example of a police detective of a very  unusual type, but I have known several other men on the New York Police  Force of real genius in their own particular lines of work. One of these  is an Irishman who makes a specialty of get-rich-quick men, oil and  mining stock operators, wire-tappers and their kin, and who knows the  antecedents and history of most of them better than any other man in the  country. He is ready to take the part of either a \"sucker\" or a fellow  crook, as the exigencies of the case may demand.    There are detectives--real ones--on the police force of all the great  cities of the world to-day, most of them specialists, a few of them  geniuses capable of undertaking the ferreting out of any sort of  mystery, but the last are rare. The police detective usually lacks the  training, education, and social experience to make him effective in  dealing with the class of elite criminals who make high society their  field. Yet, of course, it is this class of crooks who most excite our  interest and who fill the pages of popular detective fiction.    The headquarters man has no time nor inclination to follow the sporting  duchess and the fictitious earl who accompanies her in their picturesque  wanderings around the world. He is busy inside the confines of his own  country. Parents or children may disappear, but the mere seeking of  oblivion on their part is no crime and does not concern him except by  special dispensation on the part of his superiors. Divorced couples may  steal their own children back and forth, royalties may inadvertently  involve themselves with undesirables, governmental information exude  from State portals in a peculiar manner, business secrets pass into  the hands of rivals, racehorses develop strange and untimely diseases,  husbands take long and mysterious trips from home--a thousand exciting  and worrying things may happen to the astonishment, distress, or  intense interest of nations, governments, political parties, or private  individuals, which from their very nature are outside the purview of the  regular police.

Under date of Washington, D.C., April 14, 1869,  published in the Washington (Pa.) _Reporter_ for April 21, 1869, he  says:        \"In the fall of 1814 I arrived in the village of 'Good Will,' and      for eighteen or twenty months sold goods in the store previously      occupied by Mr. Thos. Brice. It was on Main Street, a few doors      west of Spaulding's Tavern, where I was a boarder. With both Mr.      Solomon Spaulding and his wife I was quite intimately acquainted.      I recollect quite well Mr. Spaulding spending much time in writing      [on sheets of paper torn out of an old book] what purported to      be a veritable history of the nations or tribes who inhabited      Canaan. He called it 'Lost History Found,' 'Lost Manuscript,' or      some such name, not disguising that it was wholly a work of the      imagination, written to amuse himself and without any immediate      view to publication. I was struck with the minuteness of his      details and the apparent truthfulness and sincerity of the author.      I have an indistinct recollection of the passage referred to by Mr.      Miller about the Amlicites making a cross with red paint on their      foreheads to distinguish them from enemies in the confusion of      battle.\"    The eleventh witness is the Rev. Abner Jackson, who, when but a boy and  confined with a lame knee, heard Solomon Spaulding read to his father  much of the former's story, and also heard him give an outline of the  whole. Mr. Jackson, under date of December 20, 1880, made the following  statement to the Washington County (Pa.) _Reporter_ of January 7,  1881: [154]    [Footnote 154: See also \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 6-7.]        \"Spaulding frequently read his manuscript to the neighbors and      amused them as he progressed with the work. He wrote it in Bible      style. 'And it came to pass' occurred so often that some called      him 'Old Come-to-pass.' The Book of Mormon follows the romance too      closely to be a stranger. In both, many persons appear having the      same name, as Moroni, Mormon, Nephites, Laman, Lamanites, Nephi,      and others. Here we are presented with romance second called      the Book of Mormon, telling the same story of the same people,      traveling from the same plain, in the same way, having the same      difficulties and destination, with the same wars, same battles      and same results, with thousands upon thousands slain. Then see      the Mormon account of the last battle at Cumorah, where all the      righteous were slain. How much this resembles the closing scene in      the 'Manuscript Found.' The most singular part of the whole matter      is that it follows the romance so closely, with this difference:      The first claims to be a romance, the second claims to be a      revelation of God, a new Bible. When it was brought to Conneaut and      read there in public, old Squire Wright heard it and exclaimed,      'Old-Come-to-pass has come to life again.' Here was the place where      Spaulding wrote and read his manuscript to the neighbors for their      amusement, and Squire Wright had often heard him read from his      romance. This was in 1832, sixteen years after Spaulding's death.      This Squire Wright lived on a little farm just outside of the      little village. I was acquainted with him for twenty-five years.      I lived on his farm when I was a boy and attended school in his      village. I am particular to notice these things to show that I had      an opportunity of knowing what I am writing about.\"    Squire Wright, referred to in Mr. Jackson's statement, is the same  Aaron Wright who was our fifth witness upon the question of identity.    Last, but not least, we, introduce John C. Bennett. He says he joined  the Mormons in order to enable himself to expose their iniquity. He  was quartermaster-general of Illinois, the mayor of Nauvoo, a master  in chancery for Hancock County, III., appointed by then Judge Stephen  A. Douglas, a trustee for the \"University of the City of Nauvoo,\" the  recipient of special mention in revelation purporting to come direct  from God, as well as innumerable encomiums from church leaders and  the church organ. The Mormon people have called Bennett more kinds  of a liar, it seems to me, than any man was ever called before. When  Mormons are asked just what statement of Bennett's warrants the  charge, they usually confess they never read his book. In the light of  subsequent history and later church admissions, there is not one of  Bennett's innumerable charges of almost unbelievable iniquity which I  cannot demonstrate to be substantially true as to the character of the  iniquity, if not the special manifestation of it, and do so wholly from  the evidence of Mormon church publications. I, therefore, believe what  Bennett says, and here quote so much of his testimony as relates to the  origin of the Book of Mormon. He says:        \"I will remark here in confirmation of the above [he having quoted      a small part of the statements herein last above quoted] that the      Book of Mormon was originally written by the Rev. Solomon      Spaulding, A. M., as a romance and entitled the 'Manuscript      Found,' and placed by him in the printing office of Patterson      and Lambdin, in the city of Pittsburg, from whence it was taken      by a _conspicuous Mormon divine_ and remodeled by adding the      religious portion, placed by him in Smith's possession, and then      published to the world as the testimony exemplifies. This I have      from the confederation, and of its perfect correctness there is      not the shadow of a doubt. There never were any plates of the      Book of Mormon excepting what were seen by the spiritual and not      the natural eyes of the witnesses. The story of the plates is all      chimerical.\" [155]    [Footnote 155: Bennett's \"Mormonism Exposed,\" 123-4--1842.]    It will be observed Bennett does not name Rigdon or Pratt in his  statement. The reason is apparent from reading certain correspondence  published in the book from which it appears that at the same time  of writing he entertained a reasonable hope that Sidney Rigdon and  the Pratts would leave the church and join him in his anti-Mormon  crusade, and he probably did not wish to unduly embarrass his supposed  confederates, who were still apparently within the fold.    FOR THE LOVE OF GOLD, NOT GOD.    With the exception of establishing the motive, our case is now  complete. The natural inference, of course, is that the greed for gain  furnished the dynamics of the scheme, but we must not leave even this  fact without direct evidence. Mormons point to the violent death of  Smith as a martyrdom, and assume this sufficient answer to the charge  of selfishness. A man who, as was the case with Smith, dies with a  six-shooter in his own hand, firing it at his assailants, [156] is in a  novel pose for a martyr, and yet we may admit that Smith would not from  selfish ends have chosen a career of imposture had he in the beginning  been able to foresee his ignominious end.    [Footnote 156: \"Rise and Fall of Nauvoo,\" 443. Bancroft's \"History of  Utah,\" 170.]    Soon after Rigdon's visit to Smith and the reception of the revelation  making Kirtland the gathering place of the \"Saints,\" Smith's family,  together with their followers, moved to Ohio. Revelations now came  thick and fast, and of such a character as to demonstrate that the love  of gold, and not God, was the inducing cause of their existence. I  quote a few pertinent samples:        \"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me, and the same will _feed_ you and      _clothe_ you and _give you money-_and he who doeth not these things      is not my disciple,\" [157]    [Footnote 157: Doctrine and Covenants, 84, 89.]        \"It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an      example unto the church _in laying his money before the bishop_      of the church. And also this is a law unto every man that cometh      unto this land to receive an inheritance, and he shall do with this      money according as the law directs.\" [158]    [Footnote 158: Doctrine and Covenants, 58:35, 36.]        \"And let all _the monies which can be spared, it mattereth not_      unto me whether it be little or much, be sent up unto the land of      Zion unto those I have appointed to receive it.\" [159]    [Footnote 159: Doctrine and Covenants, 63:40.]        \"And let all those who have not families, who receive _monies,_      send it up unto the Bishop of Zion.\" [160]    [Footnote 160: Doctrine and Covenants, 84:104.]        \"Behold, this is my will obtaining moneys even as I have      directed.\" [161]    [Footnote 161: Doctrine and Covenants, 66:45. Supplement 14 _Millennial  Star,_ 80.]        \"Impart a portion of thy property; yea, even part of thy lands, and      _all_ save the support of thy family.\" [162]    [Footnote 162: Doctrine and Covenants, 10:34.]        \"Verily thus saith the Lord, I _require all their surplus_ property      to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church of Zion.\" [163]    [Footnote 163: Doctrine and Covenants, 119:1.]        \"And in temporal labor thou [Smith, the athlete,] shalt not give      strength, for this is not thy calling.\" [164]    [Footnote 164: Doctrine and Covenants, 24:9.]        _\"They shall support thee_ and I will bless them both spiritually      and temporally.\" [165]    [Footnote 165: Doctrine and Covenants, 24:3.]        \"If ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom, _provide for Him_      [Smith] _food and raiment_ and whatsoever he needeth to accomplish      the work.\" [166]    [Footnote 166: Doctrine and Covenants, 43:13.]        \"He who _feeds_ you, or _clothes_ you, or gives you _money_ shall      in no wise lose his reward.\" [167]    [Footnote 167: Doctrine and Covenants, 84:90.]        \"He that _sendeth up treasures_ unto the land of Zion shall receive      an inheritance"]]]
