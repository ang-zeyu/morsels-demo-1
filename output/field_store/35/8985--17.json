WALLENSTEIN.                 I will hear, however,  What the Swede has to say to me.    ILLO (_eagerly to_ TERZKY).        Go, call him  He stands without the door in waiting.    WALLENSTEIN.                                Stay!  Stay but a little. It hath taken me  All by surprise; it came too quick upon me;  'Tis wholly novel that an accident,  With its dark lordship, and blind agency,  Should force me on with it.    ILLO.                   First hear him only,  And after weigh it.                          [_Exeunt_ TERZKY _and_ ILLO.]      SCENE IV.      WALLENSTEIN (_in soliloquy_).                   Is it possible?  Is't so! I _can_ no longer what I _would_?  No longer draw back at my liking? I  Must _do_ the deed, because I _thought_ of it?  And fed this heart here with a dream? Because  I did not scowl temptation from my presence,  Dallied with thoughts of possible fulfilment,  Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain,  And only kept the road, the access open?  By the great God of Heaven! it was not  My serious meaning, it was ne'er resolved.  I but amused myself with thinking of it.  The free-will tempted me, the power to do  Or not to do it--Was it criminal  To make the fancy minister to hope,  To fill the air with pretty toys of air,  And clutch fantastic sceptres moving t'ward me!  Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not  The road of duty close beside me--but  One little step, and once more I was in it!  Where am I? Whither have I been transported?  No road, no track behind me, but a wall  Impenetrable, insurmountable,  Rises obedient to the spells I muttered  And meant not--my own doings tower behind me.                 [_Pauses and remains in deep thought._]    A punishable man I seem; the guilt,  Try what I will, I cannot roll off from me;  The equivocal demeanor of my life  Bears witness on my prosecutor's party.  And even my purest acts from purest motives  Suspicion poisons with malicious gloss.  Were I that thing for which I pass, that traitor,  A goodly outside I had sure reserved,  Had drawn the coverings thick and double round me,  Been calm and chary of my utterance;  But being conscious of the innocence  Of my intent, my uncorrupted will,  I gave way to my humors, to my passion:  Bold were my words, because my deeds were _not_.  Now every planless measure, chance event,  The threat of rage, the vaunt of joy and triumph,  And all the May-games of a heart o'erflowing,  Will they connect, and weave them all together  Into one web of treason; all will be plain,  My eye ne'er absent from the far-off mark,  Step tracing step, each step a politic progress;  And out of all they'll fabricate a charge  So specious that I must myself stand dumb.  I am caught in my own net, and only force,  Nought but a sudden rent, can liberate me.            [_Pauses again._]    How else! since that the heart's unbias'd instinct  Impell'd me to the daring deed, which now  Necessity, self-preservation, _orders_.  Stern is the on-look of Necessity,  Not without shudder may a human hand  Grasp the mysterious urn of destiny.  My deed was mine, remaining in my bosom:  Once suffer'd to escape from its safe corner  Within the heart, its nursery and birth-place,  Sent forth into the Foreign, it belongs  Forever to those sly malicious powers  Whom never art of man conciliated.    [_Paces in agitation through the chamber, then pauses, and  after the pause breaks out again into audible soliloquy._]    What is thy enterprise? thy aim? thy object?  Hast honestly confess'd it to thyself?  Power seated on a quiet throne thou'dst shake,  Power on an ancient consecrated throne,  Strong in possession, founded in all custom;  Power by a thousand tough and stringy roots  Fix'd to the people's pious nursery-faith.  This, this will be no strife of strength with strength.  That fear'd I not. I brave each combatant,  Whom I can look on, fixing eye to eye,  Who, full himself of courage, kindles courage  In me too. 'Tis a foe invisible  The which I fear--a fearful enemy,  Which in the human heart opposes me,  By its coward fear alone made fearful to me.  Not that, which full of life, instinct with power,  Makes known its present being; that is not  The true, the perilously formidable.  O no! it is the common, the quite common,  The thing of an eternal yesterday.  What ever was, and evermore returns,  Sterling tomorrow, for today 'twas sterling!  For of the wholly common is man made,  And custom is his nurse! Woe then to them  Who lay irreverent hands upon his old  House furniture, the dear inheritance  From his forefathers! For time consecrates;  And what is gray with age becomes religion.  Be in possession, and thou hast the right,  And sacred will the many guard it for thee!                       [_To the_ PAGE _who here enters_.]    The Swedish officer?--Well, let him enter.    [_The_ PAGE _exit_, WALLENSTEIN _fixes his eye in deep  thought on the door_.]    Yet is it pure--as yet!--the crime has come  Not o'er this threshold yet--so slender is  The boundary that divideth life's two paths.      SCENE V      WALLENSTEIN _and_ WRANGEL      WALLENSTEIN (_after having fixed a searching look on him_).    Your name is Wrangel?    WRANGEL.                    Gustave Wrangel, General  Of the Sudermanian Blues.    WALLENSTEIN.                       It was a Wrangel  Who injured me materially at Stralsund,  And by his brave resistance was the cause  Of the opposition which that sea-port made.    WRANGEL.    It was the doing of the element  With which you fought, my Lord! and not my merit.  The Baltic Neptune did assert his freedom:  The sea and land, it seem'd, were not to serve  One and the same.    [WALLENST.    You pluck'd the Admiral's hat from off my head.    WRANGEL.    I come to place a diadem thereon.]    WALLENSTEIN (_makes the motion for him to take a seat, and  seats himself_).                        And where are your credentials?  Come you provided with full powers, Sir General?    WRANGEL.    There are so many scruples yet to solve--    WALLENSTEIN (_having read the credentials_).    An able letter!--Ay--he is a prudent  Intelligent master whom you serve, Sir General!  The Chancellor writes me, that he but fulfils  His late departed Sovereign's own idea  In helping me to the Bohemian crown.    WRANGEL.    He says the truth. Our great King, now in heaven,  Did ever deem most highly of your Grace's  Preeminent sense and military genius;  And always the commanding Intellect,  He said, should have command, and be the King.    WALLENST.    Yes, he _might_ say it safely.--General Wrangel,                        [_Taking his hand affectionately._]    Come, fair and open. Trust me, I was always  A Swede at heart. Eh! that did you experience  Both in Silesia and at Nuremberg;  I had you often in my power, and let you  Always slip out by some back door or other.  'Tis this for which the Court can ne'er forgive me,  Which drives me to this present step: and since  Our interests so run in one direction,  E'en let us have a thorough confidence  Each in the other.    WRANGEL.                Confidence will come  Has each but only first security.    WALLENST.    The Chancellor still, I see, does not quite trust me;  And, I confess--the game does not lie wholly  To my advantage. Without doubt he thinks,  If I can play false with the Emperor,  Who is my sovereign, I can do the like  With the enemy, and that _the one_ too were  Sooner to be forgiven me than the _other_.  Is not this your opinion, too, Sir General?    WRANGEL.    I have here a duty merely, no opinion.    WALLENST.    The Emperor hath urged me to the uttermost:  I can no longer honorably serve him;  For my security, in self-defence,  I take this hard step, which my conscience blames.    WRANGEL.    That I believe. So far would no one go  Who was not forced to it.                         [_After a pause_.]                              What may have impell'd  Your princely Highness in this wise to act  Toward your Sovereign Lord and Emperor,  Beseems not us to expound or criticise.  The Swede is fighting for his good old cause,  With his good sword and conscience. This concurrence,  This opportunity, is in our favor,  And all advantages in war are lawful.  We take what offers without questioning;  And if all have its due and just proportions--    WALLENST.    Of what then are ye doubting? Of my will?  Or of my power? I pledged me to the Chancellor,  Would he trust _me_ with sixteen thousand men,  That I would instantly go over to them  With eighteen thousand of the Emperor's troops.    WRANGEL.    Your Grace is known to be a mighty war-chief,  To be a second Attila and Pyrrhus.  'Tis talked of still with fresh astonishment,  How some years past, beyond all human faith,  You call'd an army forth, like a creation:  But yet--    WALLENSTEIN.    But yet?    WRANGEL.             But still the Chancellor thinks  It might yet be an easier thing from nothing  To call forth sixty thousand men of battle,  Than to persuade one sixtieth part of them--    WALLENST.    What now? Out with it, friend!    WRANGEL.                      To break their oaths.    WALLENST.    And he thinks _so_? He judges like a Swede,  And like a Protestant. You Lutherans  Fight for your Bible. You are interested  About the cause; and with your _hearts_ you follow  Your banners. Among _you_, whoe'er deserts  To the enemy hath broken covenant  With two Lords at one time. We've no such fancies.    WRANGEL.    Great God in Heaven! Have then the people here  No house and home, no fireside, no altar?    WALLENST.    I will explain that to you, how it stands:--  The Austrian _has_ a country, ay, and loves it,  And has good cause to love it--but this army,  That calls itself the Imperial, this that houses  Here in Bohemia, this has none--no country;  This is an outcast of all foreign lands,  Unclaim'd by town or tribe, to whom belongs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#16)"],[1,"long, formidable ranges of limestone mountains which divide the Serbian  interior from the Adriatic in almost unbroken and parallel lines have  always been a barrier to the extension of Serb power to the coast, and an  obstacle to free commercial intercourse. Nevertheless Ragusa was a great  trade centre, and one of the factors which most contributed to the  economic strength of the Serbian Empire.    The first of the Nemanja dynasty was Stephen, whose title was still only  _Veliki ['Z]upan_; he extended Serb territory southwards at the expense of  the Greeks, especially after the death of Manuel Comnenus in 1180. He also  persecuted the Bogomils, who took refuge in large numbers in the adjacent  Serb state of Bosnia. Like many other Serbian rulers, he abdicated in  later life in favour of his younger son, Stephen, called Nemanjie (=  Nemanya's son), and himself became a monk (1196), travelling for this  purpose to Mount Athos, the great monastic centre and home of theological  learning of the Eastern Church. There he saw his youngest son, who some  years previously had also journeyed thither and entered a monastery,  taking the name of Sava.    It was the custom for every Serbian ruler to found a sort of memorial  church, for the welfare of his own soul, before his death, and to decorate  and endow it lavishly. Stephen and his son together superintended the  erection in this sense of the church and monastery of Hilandar on Mount  Athos, which became a famous centre of Serbian church life. Stephen died  shortly after the completion of the building in 1199, and was buried in  it, but in 1207 he was reinterred in the monastery of Studenica, in  Serbia, also founded by him.    The reign of Stephen Nernanji['c] (1196-1223) opened with a quarrel  between him and his elder brother, who not unnaturally felt he ought to  have succeeded his father; the Bulgarians profited by this and seized a  large part of eastern Serbia, including Belgrade, Nish, Prizren, and  Skoplje. This, together with the fall of Constantinople and the  establishment of the Latin Empire in 1204, alarmed the Serbs and brought  about a reconciliation between the brothers, and in 1207 Sava returned to  Serbia to organise the Church on national lines. In 1219 he journeyed to  Nicaea and extracted from the Emperor Theodore Lascaris, who had fallen on  evil days, the concession for the establishment of an autonomous national  Serbian Church, independent of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Sava  himself was at the head of the new institution. In 1220 he solemnly  crowned his brother King _(Kralj)_ of Serbia, the natural consequence of  his activities in the previous year. For this reason Stephen Nemanji['c]  is called 'The First-Crowned'. He was succeeded in 1223 by his son Stephen  Radoslav, and he in turn was deposed by his brother Stephen Vladislav in  1233. Both these were crowned by Sava, and Vladislav married the daughter  of Tsar John Asen II, under whom Bulgaria was then at the height of her  power. Sava journeyed to Palestine, and on his return paid a visit to the  Bulgarian court at Tirnovo, where he died in 1236. His body was brought to  Serbia and buried in the monastery of Mile[)s]evo, built by Vladislav.  This extremely able churchman and politician, who did a great deal for the  peaceful development of his country, was canonized and is regarded as the  patron saint of Serbia.    The reign of Vladislav's son and successor, Stephen Uro[)s] I (1242-76),  was characterized by economic development and the strengthening of the  internal administration. In external affairs he made no conquests, but  defeated a combination of the Bulgarians with Ragusa against him, and  after the war the Bulgarian ruler married his daughter. In his wars  against Hungary he was unsuccessful, and the Magyars remained in  possession of a large part of northern Serbia. In 1276 he was deposed by  his son, Stephen Dragutin, who in his turn, after an unsuccessful war  against the Greeks, again masters of Constantinople since 1261, was  deposed and succeeded by his brother, Stephen Uro[)s] II, named Milutin,  in 1282. This king ruled from 1282 till 1321, and during his reign the  country made very great material progress; its mineral wealth especially,  which included gold and silver mines, began to be exploited. He extended  the boundaries of his kingdom in the north, making the Danube and the Save  the frontier. The usual revolt against paternal authority was made by his  son Stephen, but was unsuccessful, and the rebel was banished to  Constantinople.    It was the custom of the Serbian kings to give appanages to their sons,  and the inevitable consequence of this system was the series of provincial  rebellions which occurred in almost every reign. When the revolt  succeeded, the father (or brother) was granted in his turn a small  appanage. In this case it was the son who was exiled, but he was recalled  in 1319 and a reconciliation took place. Milutin died in 1321 and was  succeeded by his son, Stephen Uro[)s] III, who reigned till 1331. He is  known as Stephen De[)c]anski, after the memorial church which he built at  De[)c]ani in western Serbia. His reign was signalized by a great defeat of  the combined Bulgarians and Greeks at Kustendil in Macedonia in 1330. The  following year his son, Stephen Du[)s]an, rebelled against him and deposed  him. Stephen Du[)s]an, who reigned from 1331 till 1355, was Serbia's  greatest ruler, and under him the country reached its utmost limits.  Provincial and family revolts and petty local disputes with such places as  Ragusa became a thing of the past, and he undertook conquest on a grand  scale. Between 1331 and 1344 he subjected all Macedonia, Albania,  Thessaly, and Epirus. He was careful to keep on good terms with Ragusa and  with Hungary, then under Charles Robert. He married the sister of the  Bulgarian ruler, and during his reign Bulgaria was completely under  Serbian supremacy. The anarchy and civil war which had become perennial at  Constantinople, and the weakening of the Greek Empire in face of the  growing power of the Turks, no doubt to some extent explain the facility  and rapidity of his conquests; nevertheless his power was very formidable,  and his success inspired considerable alarm in western Europe. This was  increased when, in 1345, he proclaimed his country an empire. He first  called together a special Church council, at which the Serbian Church, an  archbishopric, whose centre was then at Pe['c] (in Montenegro, Ipek in  Turkish), was proclaimed a Patriarchate, with Archbishop Joannice as  Patriarch; then this prelate, together with the Bulgarian Patriarch,  Simeon, and Nicholas, Archbishop of Okhrida, crowned Stephen Tsar of the  Serbs, Bulgars, and Greeks. Upon this the Patriarch of Constantinople gave  himself the vain satisfaction of anathematizing the whole of Serbia, as a  punishment for this insubordination.    In 1353 the Pope, Innocent VI, persuaded King Louis of Hungary to  undertake a crusade against Serbia in the name of Catholicism, but Stephen  defeated him and re-established his frontier along the Save and Danube.  Later he conquered the southern half of Dalmatia, and extended his empire  as far north as the river Cetina. In 1354 Stephen Du[)s]an himself  approached the Pope, offering to acknowledge his spiritual supremacy, if  he would support him against the Hungarians and the Turks. The Pope sent  him an embassy, but eventually Stephen could not agree to the papal  conditions, and concluded an alliance, of greater practical utility, with  the Venetians. In 1355, however, he suddenly died, at the age of  forty-six, and thus the further development and aggrandisement of his  country was prematurely arrested.    Stephen Du[)s]an made a great impression on his contemporaries, both by  his imposing personal appearance and by his undoubted wisdom and ability.  He was especially a great legislator, and his remarkable code of laws,  compiled in 1349 and enlarged in 1354, is, outside his own country, his  greatest title to fame. During Stephen Du[)s]an's reign the political  centre of Serbia, which had for many years gradually tended to shift  southwards towards Macedonia, was at Skoplje (Ueskueb in Turkish), which he  made his capital. Stephen Du[)s]an's empire extended from the Adriatic in  the west to the river Maritsa in the east, from the Save and Danube in the  north to the Aegean; it included all the modern kingdoms of Serbia,  Montenegro, Albania, and most of Greece, Dalmatia as far north as the  river Cetina, as well as the fertile Morava valley, with Nish and  Belgrade--the whole eastern part of Serbia, which had for long been under  either Bulgar or Magyar control. It did not include the cities of Salonika  or Ragusa, nor any considerable part of the modern kingdom of Bulgaria,  nor Bosnia, Croatia, North Dalmatia, nor Slavonia (between the Save and  Drave), ethnologically all purely Serb lands. From the point of view of  nationality, therefore, its boundaries were far from ideal.    Stephen Du[)s]an was succeeded by his son, known as Tsar Uro[)s], but he  was as weak as his father had been strong. Almost as soon as he succeeded  to the throne, disorders, rebellions, and dissensions broke out and the  empire rapidly fell to pieces. With Serbia, as with Bulgaria, the empire  entirely hinged on the personality of one man, and when he was gone chaos  returned. Such an event for Serbia at this juncture was fatal, as a far  more formidable foe than the ruler's rebellious relations was advancing  against it. The Turkish conquests were proceeding apace; they had taken  Gallipoli in 1354 and Demotika and Adrianople in 1361. The Serbs, who had  already had an unsuccessful brush with the advance guard of the new  invaders near Demotika in 1351, met them again on the Maritsa river in  1371, and were completely defeated.
