Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up  Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room  To my o'erlabour'd sight: when at the name  Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke  Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might  Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix'd.  And, as the bright dimensions of the star  In heav'n excelling, as once here on earth  Were, in my eyeballs lively portray'd,  Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,  Circling in fashion of a diadem,  And girt the star, and hov'ring round it wheel'd.    Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,  And draws the spirit most unto itself,  Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,  Compar'd unto the sounding of that lyre,  Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays  The floor of heav'n, was crown'd. \"Angelic Love  I am, who thus with hov'ring flight enwheel  The lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,  Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,  Lady of Heav'n! will hover; long as thou  Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy  Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere.\"    Such close was to the circling melody:  And, as it ended, all the other lights  Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.    The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps  The world, and with the nearer breath of God  Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir'd  Its inner hem and skirting over us,  That yet no glimmer of its majesty  Had stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyes  Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,  That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;  And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms  For very eagerness towards the breast,  After the milk is taken; so outstretch'd  Their wavy summits all the fervent band,  Through zealous love to Mary: then in view  There halted, and \"Regina Coeli\" sang  So sweetly, the delight hath left me never.    O what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'd  In those rich-laden coffers, which below  Sow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.    Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears  Were in the Babylonian exile won,  When gold had fail'd them.  Here in synod high  Of ancient council with the new conven'd,  Under the Son of Mary and of God,  Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,  To whom the keys of glory were assign'd.          CANTO XXIV    \"O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc'd  To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,  Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd!  If to this man through God's grace be vouchsaf'd  Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,  Or ever death his fated term prescribe;  Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;  But may some influence of your sacred dews  Sprinkle him.  Of the fount ye alway drink,  Whence flows what most he craves.\"  Beatrice spake,  And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres  On firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blaze  Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind  Their circles in the horologe, so work  The stated rounds, that to th' observant eye  The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;  E'en thus their carols weaving variously,  They by the measure pac'd, or swift, or slow,  Made me to rate the riches of their joy.    From that, which I did note in beauty most  Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame  So bright, as none was left more goodly there.  Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about,  With so divine a song, that fancy's ear  Records it not; and the pen passeth on  And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,  Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain,  Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.    \"O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout  Is with so vehement affection urg'd,  Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere.\"    Such were the accents towards my lady breath'd  From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd:  To whom she thus: \"O everlasting light  Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord  Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss  He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,  With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,  By the which thou didst on the billows walk.  If he in love, in hope, and in belief,  Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou  Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld  In liveliest portraiture.  But since true faith  Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,  Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,  Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse.\"    Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,  And speaks not, till the master have propos'd  The question, to approve, and not to end it;  So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake,  Summoning up each argument to aid;  As was behooveful for such questioner,  And such profession: \"As good Christian ought,  Declare thee, What is faith?\"  Whereat I rais'd  My forehead to the light, whence this had breath'd,  Then turn'd to Beatrice, and in her looks  Approval met, that from their inmost fount  I should unlock the waters.  \"May the grace,  That giveth me the captain of the church  For confessor,\" said I, \"vouchsafe to me  Apt utterance for my thoughts!\" then added: \"Sire!  E'en as set down by the unerring style  Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir'd  To bring Rome in unto the way of life,  Faith of things hop'd is substance, and the proof  Of things not seen; and herein doth consist  Methinks its essence,\"--\"Rightly hast thou deem'd,\"  Was answer'd: \"if thou well discern, why first  He hath defin'd it, substance, and then proof.\"    \"The deep things,\" I replied, \"which here I scan  Distinctly, are below from mortal eye  So hidden, they have in belief alone  Their being, on which credence hope sublime  Is built; and therefore substance it intends.  And inasmuch as we must needs infer  From such belief our reasoning, all respect  To other view excluded, hence of proof  Th' intention is deriv'd.\"  Forthwith I heard:  \"If thus, whate'er by learning men attain,  Were understood, the sophist would want room  To exercise his wit.\"  So breath'd the flame  Of love: then added: \"Current is the coin  Thou utter'st, both in weight and in alloy.  But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.\"    \"Even so glittering and so round,\" said I,  \"I not a whit misdoubt of its assay.\"    Next issued from the deep imbosom'd splendour:  \"Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which  Is founded every virtue, came to thee.\"  \"The flood,\" I answer'd, \"from the Spirit of God  Rain'd down upon the ancient bond and new,--  Here is the reas'ning, that convinceth me  So feelingly, each argument beside  Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.\"  Then heard I: \"Wherefore holdest thou that each,  The elder proposition and the new,  Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav'n?\"    \"The works, that follow'd, evidence their truth;\"  I answer'd: \"Nature did not make for these  The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.\"  \"Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,\"  Was the reply, \"that they in very deed  Are that they purport?  None hath sworn so to thee.\"    \"That all the world,\" said I, \"should have been turn'd  To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,  Would in itself be such a miracle,  The rest were not an hundredth part so great.  E'en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger  To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,  It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.\"  That ended, through the high celestial court  Resounded all the spheres.  \"Praise we one God!\"  In song of most unearthly melody.  And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,  Examining, had led me, that we now  Approach'd the topmost bough, he straight resum'd;  \"The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,  So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos'd  That, whatsoe'er has past them, I commend.  Behooves thee to express, what thou believ'st,  The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.\"    \"O saintly sire and spirit!\" I began,  \"Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,  As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,  Toward the sepulchre?  thy will is here,  That I the tenour of my creed unfold;  And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask'd.  And I reply: I in one God believe,  One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love  All heav'n is mov'd, himself unmov'd the while.  Nor demonstration physical alone,  Or more intelligential and abstruse,  Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth  It cometh to me rather, which is shed  Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms.  The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,  When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.  In three eternal Persons I believe,  Essence threefold and one, mysterious league  Of union absolute, which, many a time,  The word of gospel lore upon my mind  Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,  The lively flame dilates, and like heav'n's star  Doth glitter in me.\"  As the master hears,  Well pleas'd, and then enfoldeth in his arms  The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,  And having told the errand keeps his peace;  Thus benediction uttering with song  Soon as my peace I held, compass'd me thrice  The apostolic radiance, whose behest  Had op'd lips; so well their answer pleas'd.          CANTO XXV    If e'er the sacred poem that hath made  Both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil,  And with lean abstinence, through many a year,  Faded my brow, be destin'd to prevail  Over the cruelty, which bars me forth  Of the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lamb  The wolves set on and fain had worried me,  With other voice and fleece of other grain  I shall forthwith return, and, standing up  At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath  Due to the poet's temples: for I there  First enter'd on the faith which maketh souls  Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,  Peter had then circled my forehead thus.    Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth  The first fruit of Christ's vicars on the earth,  Toward us mov'd a light, at view whereof  My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:  \"Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,  That makes Falicia throng'd with visitants!\"    As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,  In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/884"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 3 (#15)"],[1,"mislead; and publicly burned the works of Galen and Avicenna, as  quacks and impostors. He exclaimed, in presence of the admiring and  half-bewildered crowd, who assembled to witness the ceremony, that there  was more knowledge in his shoestrings than in the writings of these  physicians. Continuing in the same strain, he said all the universities  in the world were full of ignorant quacks; but that he, Paracelsus, over  flowed with wisdom. \"You will all follow my new system,\" said he, with  furious gesticulations, \"Avicenna, Galen, Rhazis, Montagnana, Meme--you  will all follow me, ye professors of Paris, Montpellier, Germany,  Cologne, and Vienna! and all ye that dwell on the Rhine and the  Danube--ye that inhabit the isles of the sea; and ye also, Italians,  Dalmatians, Athenians, Arabians, Jews--ye will all follow my doctrines,  for I am the monarch of medicine!\"    But he did not long enjoy the esteem of the good citizens of Basle. It  is said that he indulged in wine so freely, as not unfrequently to be  seen in the streets in a state of intoxication. This was ruinous for a  physician, and his good fame decreased rapidly. His ill fame increased  in still greater proportion, especially when he assumed the airs of a  sorcerer. He boasted of the legions of spirits at his command; and  of one especially, which he kept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword.  Wetterus, who lived twenty-seven months in his service, relates that  he often threatened to invoke a whole army of demons, and show him  the great authority which he could exercise over them. He let it be  believed, that the spirit in his sword had custody of the elixir of  life, by means of which he could make any one live to be as old as the  antediluvians. He also boasted that he had a spirit at his command,  called \"Azoth,\" whom he kept imprisoned in a jewel; and in many of the  old portraits he is represented with a jewel, inscribed with the word  \"Azoth,\" in his hand.    If a sober prophet has little honour in his own country, a drunken one  has still less. Paracelsus found it at last convenient to quit Basle,  and establish himself at Strasbourg. The immediate cause of this change  of residence was as follows:--A citizen lay at the point of death, and  was given over by all the physicians of the town. As a last resource  Paracelsus was called in, to whom the sick man promised a magnificent  recompence, if by his means he were cured. Paracelsus gave him two small  pills, which the man took and rapidly recovered. When he was quite well,  Paracelsus sent for his fee; but the citizen had no great opinion of the  value of a cure which had been so speedily effected. He had no notion  of paying a handful of gold for two pills, although they had saved his  life, and he refused to pay more than the usual fee for a single visit.  Paracelsus brought an action against him, and lost it. This result so  exasperated him, that he left Basle in high dudgeon. He resumed his  wandering life, and travelled in Germany and Hungary, supporting himself  as he went on the credulity and infatuation of all classes of society.  He cast nativities--told fortunes--aided those who had money to throw  away upon the experiment, to find the philosopher's stone--prescribed  remedies for cows and pigs, and aided in the recovery of stolen  goods. After residing successively at Nuremburg, Augsburg, Vienna, and  Mindelheim, he retired in the year 1541 to Saltzbourg, and died in a  state of abject poverty in the hospital of that town.    If this strange charlatan found hundreds of admirers during his life,  he found thousands after his death. A sect of Paracelsists sprang up  in France and Germany, to perpetuate the extravagant doctrines of their  founder upon all the sciences, and upon alchymy in particular. The chief  leaders were Bodenstein and Dorneus. The following is a summary of his  doctrine, founded upon supposed existence of the philosopher's stone; it  is worth preserving from its very absurdity, and altogether unparalleled  in the history of philosophy:--    First of all, he maintained that the contemplation of the perfection of  the Deity sufficed to procure all wisdom and knowledge; that the Bible  was the key to the theory of all diseases, and that it was necessary to  search into the Apocalypse to know the signification of magic medicine.  The man who blindly obeyed the will of God, and who succeeded in  identifying himself with the celestial intelligences, possessed the  philosopher's stone--he could cure all diseases, and prolong life to as  many centuries as he pleased; it being by the very same means that Adam  and the antediluvian patriarchs prolonged theirs. Life was an emanation  from the stars--the sun governed the heart, and the moon the brain.  Jupiter governed the liver, Saturn the gall, Mercury the lungs, Mars the  bile, and Venus the loins. In the stomach of every human being there  dwelt a demon, or intelligence, that was a sort of alchymist in his way,  and mixed, in their due proportions, in his crucible, the various  aliments that were sent into that grand laboratory the belly.[See the  article \"Paracelsus,\" by the learned Renaudin, in the \"Biographie  Universelle.\"] He was proud of the title of magician, and boasted that  he kept up a regular correspondence with Galen from hell; and that he  often summoned Avicenna from the same regions to dispute with him on the  false notions he had promulgated respecting alchymy, and especially  regarding potable gold and the elixir of life. He imagined that gold  could cure ossification of the heart, and, in fact, all diseases, if it  were gold which had been transmuted from an inferior metal by means of  the philosopher's stone, and if it were applied under certain  conjunctions of the planets. The mere list of the works in which he  advances these frantic imaginings, which he called a doctrine, would  occupy several pages.    GEORGE AGRICOLA.    This alchymist was born in the province of Misnia, in 1494. His real  name was Bauer, meaning a husbandman, which, in accordance with the  common fashion of his age, he Latinized into Agricola. From his early  youth, he delighted in the visions of the hermetic science. Ere he was  sixteen, he longed for the great elixir which was to make him live for  seven hundred years, and for the stone which was to procure him wealth  to cheer him in his multiplicity of days. He published a small treatise  upon the subject at Cologne, in 1531, which obtained him the patronage  of the celebrated Maurice, Duke of Saxony. After practising for some  years as a physician at Joachimsthal, in Bohemia, he was employed by  Maurice as superintendent of the silver mines of Chemnitz. He led a  happy life among the miners, making various experiments in alchymy  while deep in the bowels of the earth. He acquired a great knowledge  of metals, and gradually got rid of his extravagant notions about  the philosopher's stone. The miners had no faith in alchymy; and they  converted him to their way of thinking, not only in that but in other  respects. From their legends, he became firmly convinced that the bowels  of the earth were inhabited by good and evil spirits, and that firedamp  and other explosions sprang from no other causes than the mischievous  propensities of the latter. He died in the year 1555, leaving behind him  the reputation of a very able and intelligent man.    DENIS ZACHAIRE.    Autobiography, written by a wise man who was once a fool, is not  only the most instructive, but the most delightful of reading. Denis  Zachaire, an alchymist of the sixteenth century, has performed this  task, and left a record of his folly and infatuation in pursuit of the  philosopher's stone, which well repays perusal. He was born in the  year 1510, of an ancient family in Guienne, and was early sent to the  university of Bordeaux, under the care of a tutor to direct his studies.  Unfortunately, his tutor was a searcher for the grand elixir, and  soon rendered his pupil as mad as himself upon the subject. With this  introduction, we will allow Denis Zachaire to speak for himself, and  continue his narrative in his own words:--    \"I received from home,\" says he, \"the sum of two hundred crowns for the  expenses of myself and master; but before the end of the year, all our  money went away in the smoke of our furnaces. My master, at the same  time, died of a fever, brought on by the parching heat of our  laboratory, from which he seldom or never stirred, and which was  scarcely less hot than the arsenal of Venice. His death was the more  unfortunate for me, as my parents took the opportunity of reducing my  allowance, and sending me only sufficient for my board and lodging,  instead of the sum I required to continue my operations in alchymy.    \"To meet this difficulty and get out of leading-strings, I returned home  at the age of twenty-five, and mortgaged part of my property for four  hundred crowns. This sum was necessary to perform an operation of the  science, which had been communicated to me by an Italian at Toulouse,  and who, as he said, had proved its efficacy. I retained this man in my  service, that we might see the end of the experiment. I then, by means  of strong distillations, tried to calcinate gold and silver; but all my  labour was in vain. The weight of the gold I drew out of my furnace was  diminished by one-half since I put it in, and my four hundred crowns  were very soon reduced to two hundred and thirty. I gave twenty of these  to my Italian, in order that he might travel to Milan, where the author  of the receipt resided, and ask him the explanation of some passages  which we thought obscure. I remained at Toulouse all the winter, in the  hope of his return; but I might have remained there till this day if I  had waited for him, for I never saw his face again.    \"In the succeeding summer there was a great plague, which forced me  to quit the town. I did not, however, lose sight"]]]
