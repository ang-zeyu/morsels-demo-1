[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#16)"],[1," the  news, wrote on the 24th of May to Henry VIII., \"I keep you advertised of  the good opportunity it has pleased God to offer us of giving a full  account of our common enemy.  I pray you to carry into effect on your  side that which you and I have for a long while desired, wherein I for my  part will exert myself with all my might.\"  Bourbon proposed to the two  sovereigns a plan well calculated to allure them.  He made them an offer  to enter France by way of Provence with his victorious army, to  concentrate there all the re-enforcements promised him, to advance up the  Rhone, making himself master as he went of the only two strong places,  Monaco and Marseilles, he would have to encounter, to march on Lyons from  the side on which that city was defenceless, and be in four months at  Paris, whether or no he had a great battle to deliver on the march.  \"If  the king wishes to enter France without delay,\" said he to Henry VIII.'s  ambassador, \"I give his Grace leave to pluck out my two-eyes if I am not  master of Paris before All Saints.  Paris taken, all the kingdom of  France is in my power.  Paris in France is like Milan in Lombardy; if  Milan is taken, the duchy is lost; in the same way, Paris taken, the  whole of France is lost.\"  By this plan Bourbon calculated on arriving  victorious at the centre of France, in his own domains, and there  obtaining, from both nobles and people, the co-operation that had failed  him at the outset of his enterprise.  The two sovereigns were eager to  close with the proposal of the Frenchman, who was for thus handing over  to them his country; a new treaty was concluded between them on the 25th  of May, 1524, regulating the conditions and means of carrying out this  grand campaign; and it was further agreed that Provence and Dauphiny  should be added to the constable's old possessions, and should form a  state, which Charles V. promised to raise to a kingdom.  There was yet a  difficulty looming ahead.  Bourbon still hesitated to formally  acknowledge Henry VIII. as King of France, and promise him allegiance.  But at last his resistance was overcome.  At the moment of crossing the  frontier into France, and after having taken the communion, he said to  the English ambassador, Sir Richard Pace, in the presence of four of his  gentlemen, \"I promise you, on my faith, to place the crown, with the help  of my friends, on the head of our common master.\"  But, employing a ruse  of the old feudal times, the last gasp of a troubled conscience, Bourbon,  whilst promising allegiance to Henry VIII., persisted in refusing to do  him homage.  Sir Richard Pace none the less regarded the question as  decided; and, whilst urging Cardinal Wolsey to act swiftly and resolutely  in the interests of their master, he added, \"If you do not pay regard to  these matters, I shall set down to your Grace's account the loss of the  crown of France.\"    Bourbon entered Provence on the 7th of July, 1524, with an army of  eighteen thousand men, which was to be joined before long by six or seven  thousand more.  He had no difficulty in occupying Antibes, Frejus,  Draguignan, Brignoles, and even Aix; and he already began to assume the  title of Count of Provence, whilst preparing for a rapid march along by  the Rhone and a rush upon Lyons, the chief aim of the campaign; but the  Spanish generals whom Charles V. had associated with him, and amongst  others the most eminent of them, the Marquis of Pescara, peremptorily  insisted that, according to their master's order, he should besiege and  take Marseilles.  Charles V. cared more for the coasts of the  Mediterranean than for those of the Channel; he flattered himself that he  would make of Marseilles a southern Calais, which should connect Germany  with Spain, and secure their communications, political and commercial.  Bourbon objected and resisted; it was the abandonment of his general plan  for this war and a painful proof how powerless he was against the wishes  of the two sovereigns, of whom he was only the tool, although they called  him their ally.  Being forced to yield, he began the siege of Marseilles  on the 19th of August.  The place, though but slightly fortified and ill  supplied, made an energetic resistance; the name and the presence of  Bourbon at the head of the besiegers excited patriotism; the burgesses  turned soldiers; the cannon of the besiegers laid open their walls, but  they threw up a second line, an earthen rampart, called the ladies'  rampart, because all the women in the city had worked at it.  The siege  was protracted; the re-enforcements expected by Bourbon did not arrive; a  shot from Marseilles penetrated into Pescara's tent, and killed his  almoner and two of his gentlemen.  Bourbon rushed up.  \"Don't you see?\"  said Pescara to him, ironically, \"here are the keys sent to you by the  timid consuls of Marseilles.\"  Bourbon resolved to attempt an assault;  the lanzknechts and the Italians refused; Bourbon asked Pescara for his  Spaniards, but Pescara would only consent on condition that the breach  was reconnoitered afresh.  Seven soldiers were told off for this duty;  four were killed and the other three returned wounded, reporting that  between the open breach and the intrenchment extended a large ditch  filled with fireworks and defended by several batteries.  The assembled  general officers looked at one another in silence.  \"Well, gentlemen,\"  said Pescara, \"you see that the folks of Marseilles keep a table well  spread for our reception; if you like to go and sup in paradise, you are  your own masters so far; as for me, who have no desire to go thither just  yet, I am off.  But believe me,\" he added seriously, \"we had best return  to Milaness; we have left that country without a soldier; we might  possibly find our return cut off.\"  Whereupon Pescara got up and went  out; and the majority of the officers followed him.  Bourbon remained  almost alone, divided between anger and shame.  Almost as he quitted this  scene he heard that Francis I. was advancing towards Provence with an  army.  The king had suddenly decided to go to the succor of Marseilles,  which was making so good a defence.  Nothing could be a bitterer pill for  Bourbon than to retire before Francis I., whom he had but lately promised  to dethrone; but his position condemned him to suffer everything, without  allowing him the least hesitation; and on the 28th of September, 1524, he  raised the siege of Marseilles and resumed the road to Italy, harassed  even beyond Toulon by the French advance-guard, eager in its pursuit of  the traitor even more than of the enemy.    In the course of this year, 1524, whilst Bourbon was wandering as a  fugitive, trying to escape from his country, then returning to it, after  a few months, as a conqueror, and then leaving it again at the end of a  few weeks of prospective triumph, pursued by the king he had betrayed,  his case and that of his accomplices had been inquired into and disposed  of by the Parliament of Paris, dispassionately and almost coldly,  probably because of the small esteem in which the magistrates held the  court of Francis I., and of the wrong which they found had been done to  the constable.  The Parliament was not excited by a feeling of any great  danger to the king and the country; it was clear that, at the core, the  conspiracy and rebellion were very circumscribed and impotent; and the  accusations brought by the court party or their servants against the  conspirators were laughable from their very outrageousness and  unlikelihood; according to them, the accomplices of the constable meant  not only to dethrone, and, if need were, kill the king, but \"to make pies  of the children of France.\"  Parliament saw no occasion to proceed  against more than a half score of persons in confinement, and, except  nineteen defaulters who were condemned to death together with  confiscation of their property, only one capital sentence was pronounced,  against John of Poitiers, Lord of Saint-Vallier, the same who had exerted  himself to divert the constable from his plot, but who had nevertheless  not refrained from joining it, and was the most guilty of all the  accomplices in consequence of the confidential post he occupied near the  king's person.  The decree was not executed, however; Saint-Vallier  received his reprieve on the scaffold itself.  Francis I. was neither  rancorous nor cruel; and the entreaties, or, according to some  evil-speakers of the day, the kind favors, of the Lady de Brew,  Saint-Vallier's daughter and subsequently the celebrated Diana of  Poitiers, obtained from the king her father's life.    Francis I., greatly vexed, it is said, at the lenity of the Parliament of  Paris, summoned commissions chosen amongst the Parliaments of Rouen,  Dijon, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, and made them reconsider the case.  The  provincial Parliaments decided as that of Paris had.  The procedure  against the principal culprit was several times suspended and resumed  according to the course of events, and the decree was not pronounced so  long as the Duke of Bourbon lived.  It was abroad and in his alliance  with foreign sovereigns that all his importance lay.    After Bourbon's precipitate retreat, the position of Francis I. was a  good one.  He had triumphed over conspiracy and invasion; the conspiracy  had not been catching, and the invasion had failed on all the frontiers.  If the king, in security within his kingdom, had confined himself to it,  whilst applying himself to the task of governing it well, he would have  obtained all the strength he required to make himself feared and deferred  to abroad.  For a while he seemed to have entertained this design: on the  25th of September, 1523, he published an important ordinance for the  repression of disorderliness and outrages on the part of the soldiery in  France itself; and, on the 28th of December following, a regulation as to  the administration of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#16)"],[1," the side of France; her territory was forbidden  ground to the Jacobites, and the Pretender, who had taken refuge at  Avignon on papal soil, was to be called upon to cross the Alps.  The  English required the abandonment of the works upon the canal of Mardyck,  intended to replace the harbor of Dunkerque the Hollanders claimed  commercial advantages.  Dubois yielded on all the points, defending to  the last with fruitless tenacity the title of King of France, which the  English still disputed.  The negotiations came to an end at length on the  6th of January, 1717, and Dubois wrote in triumph to the Regent, \"I  signed at midnight; so there are you quit of servitude (your own master),  and here am I quit of fear.\"  The treaty of the triple alliance brought  the negotiator before long a more solid advantage; he was appointed  secretary of state for foreign affairs; it was on this occasion that he  wrote to Mr. Craggs, King George's minister, a letter worthy of his  character, and which contributed a great deal towards gaining credit for  the notion that he had sold himself to England.  \"If I were to follow  only the impulse of my gratitude and were not restrained by respect, I  should take the liberty of writing to H. B. Majesty to thank him for the  place with which my lord the Regent has gratified me, inasmuch as I owe  it to nothing but to the desire he felt not to employ in affairs common  to France and England anybody who might not be agreeable to the King of  Great Britain.\"    At the moment when the signature was being put to the treaty of the  triple alliance, the sovereign of most distinction in Europe, owing to  the eccentric renown belonging to his personal merit, the czar Peter the  Great, had just made flattering advances to France.  He had some time  before wished to take a trip to Paris, but Louis XIV. was old,  melancholy, and vanquished, and had declined the czar's visit.  The  Regent could not do the same thing, when, being at the Hague in 1717,  Peter I. repeated the expression of his desire.  Marshal Cosse was sent  to meet him, and the honors due to the king himself were everywhere paid  to him on the road.  A singular mixture of military and barbaric  roughness with the natural grandeur of a conqueror and creator of an  empire, the czar mightily excited the curiosity of the Parisians.  \"Sometimes, feeling bored by the confluence of spectators,\" says Duclos,  \"but never disconcerted, he would dismiss them with a word, a gesture, or  would go away without ceremony, to stroll whither his fancy impelled him.  He was a mighty tall man, very well made, rather lean, face rather round  in shape, a high forehead, fine eyebrows, complexion reddish and brown,  fine black eyes, large, lively, piercing; well-opened; a glance majestic  and gracious when he cared for it, otherwise stern and fierce, with a tic  that did not recur often, but that affected his eyes and his whole  countenance, and struck terror.  It lasted an instant, with a glance wild  and terrible, and immediately passed away.  His whole air indicated his  intellect, his reflection, his grandeur, and did not lack a certain  grace.  In all his visits he combined a majesty the loftiest, the  proudest, the most delicate, the most sustained, at the same time the  least embarrassing when he had once established it, with a politeness  which savored of it, always and in all cases; masterlike everywhere, but  with degrees according to persons.  He had a sort of familiarity which  came of frankness, but he was not exempt from a strong impress of that  barbarism of his country which rendered all his ways prompt and sudden,  and his wishes uncertain, without bearing to be contradicted in any.\"  Eating and drinking freely, getting drunk sometimes, rushing about the  streets in hired coach, or cab, or the carriage of people who came to see  him, of which he took possession unceremoniously, he testified towards  the Regent a familiar good grace mingled with a certain superiority;  at the play, to which they went together, the czar asked for beer; the  Regent rose, took the goblet which was brought and handed it to Peter,  who drank, and, without moving, put the glass back on the tray which the  Regent held all the while, with a slight inclination of the head, which,  however, surprised the public.  At his first interview with the little  king, he took up the child in his arms, and kissed him over and over  again, \"with an air of tenderness and politeness which was full of  nature, and nevertheless intermixed with a something of grandeur,  equality of rank, and, slightly, superiority of age; for all that was  distinctly perceptible.\"  We know how he went to see Madame de Maintenon.  One of his first visits was to the church of the Sorbonne; when he caught  sight of Richelieu's monument, he ran up to it, embraced the statue, and,  \"Ah! great man,\" said he, \"if thou wert still alive, I would give thee  one half of my kingdom to teach me to govern the other.\"    [Illustration: Peter the Great and Little Louis XV----82]    The czar was for seeing everything, studying everything; everything  interested him, save the court and its frivolities; he did not go to  visit the princesses of the blood, and confined himself to saluting them  coldly, whilst passing along a terrace; but he was present at a sitting  of the Parliament and of the academies, he examined the organization of  all the public establishments, he visited the shops of the celebrated  workmen, he handled the coining-die whilst there was being struck in his  honor a medal bearing a Fame with these words: _Vires acquiret eundo_  ('Twill gather strength as it goes.) He received a visit from the doctors  of the Sorbonne, who brought him a memorial touching the reunion of the  Greek and Latin Churches.  \"I am a mere soldier,\" said he, \"but I will  gladly have an examination made of the memorial you present to me.\"  Amidst all his chatting, studying, and information-hunting, Peter the  Great did not forget the political object of his trip.  He wanted to  detach France from Sweden, her heretofore faithful ally, still receiving  a subsidy which the czar would fain have appropriated to himself.  Together with his own alliance, he promised that of Poland and of  Prussia.  \"France has nothing to fear from the emperor,\" he said; as for  King George, whom he detested, \"if any rupture should take place between  him and the Regent, Russia would suffice to fill towards France the place  of England as well as of Sweden.\"    Thanks to the ability of Dubois, the Regent felt himself infeoffed to  England; he gave a cool reception to the overtures of the czar, who  proposed a treaty of alliance and commerce.  Prussia had already  concluded secretly with France; Poland was distracted by intestine  struggles; matters were confined to the establishment of amicable  relations; France thenceforth maintained an ambassador in Russia, and the  czar accepted the Regent's mediation between Sweden and himself.  \"France  will be ruined by luxury and daintiness,\" said Peter the Great, at his  departure, more impressed with the danger run by the nation from a court  which was elegant even to effeminacy than by the irregularity of the  morals, to which elsewhere he was personally accustomed.    Dubois, however, went on negotiating, although he had displayed no sort  of alacrity towards the czar; he was struggling everywhere throughout  Europe against the influence of a broader, bolder, more powerful mind  than his own, less adroit perhaps in intrigue, but equally destitute of  scruples as to the employment of means.  Alberoni had restored the  finances, and reformed the administration of Spain; he was preparing an  army and a fleet, meditating, he said, to bring peace to the world, and  beginning that great enterprise by manoeuvres which tended to nothing  less than setting fire to the four corners of Europe, in the name of an  enfeebled and heavy-going king, and of a queen ambitious, adroit, and  unpopular, \"both of whom he had put under lock and key, keeping the key  in his pocket,\" says St. Simon.  He dreamed of reviving the ascendency of  Spain in Italy, of overthrowing the Protestant king of England, whilst  restoring the Stuarts to the throne, and of raising himself to the  highest dignities in Church and State.  He had already obtained from Pope  Clement XI. the cardinal's hat, disguising under pretext of war against  the Turks the preparations he was making against Italy; he had formed an  alliance between Charles XII. and the czar, intending to sustain, by  their united forces, the attempts of the Jacobites in England.  His first  enterprise, at sea, made him master of Sardinia within a few days; the  Spanish troops landed in Sicily.  The emperor and Victor Amadeo were in  commotion; the pope, overwhelmed with reproaches by those princes, wept,  after his fashion, saying that he had damned himself by raising Alberoni  to the Roman purple; Dubois profited by the disquietude excited in Europe  by the bellicose attitude of the Spanish minister to finally draw the  emperor into the alliance between France and England.  He was to renounce  his pretensions to Spain and the Indies, and give up Sardinia to Savoy,  which was to surrender Sicily to him.  The succession to the duchies of  Parma and Tuscany was to be secured to the children of the Queen of  Spain.  \"Every difficulty would be removed if there were an appearance of  more equality,\" wrote the Regent to Dubois on the 24th of January, 1718.  \"I am quite aware that my personal interest does not suffer from this  inequality, and that it is a species of touchstone for discovering my  friends as well at home as abroad.  But I am Regent of France, and I  ought to so behave myself that none may be able to reproach me with  having thought of nothing but myself.  I also owe some consideration to  the Spaniards, whom I should completely disgust by making with the  emperor an"]]]
