He  never again would send anything to them.    He was inclined to be irritated by inartistic points in his sitters,  and is said to have muttered when he was painting the portrait of  Mrs. Siddons, the great actress: \"Damn your nose madam; there is no  end to it.\" The nose in question must have been an \"eyesore\" to more  than Gainsborough, for a famous critic is said to have declared that  \"Mrs. Siddons, with all her beauty was a kind of female Johnson ...  her nose was not too long for nothing.\"    Notwithstanding that his landscapes were not popular, he used to go  off into the country to indulge his taste for painting them, and once  he wrote to a friend that he meant to mount \"all the Lakes at the next  Exhibition in the great style, and you know, if people don't like  them, it's only jumping into one of the deepest of them from off a  wooded island and my reputation will be fixed forever.\" An old lady,  whose guest he was, down in the country, told how he was \"gay, very  gay, and good looking, creating a great sensation, in a rich suit of  drab with laced ruffles and cocked hat.\"    One of the boys he saw in the country he delighted to paint, and he  also grew so much attached to him that he took him to London and kept  him with him as his own son. That boy's name was Jack Hill and he did  not care for city life, nor maybe for Gainsborough's eccentricities,  so he ran away. He was found again and again, till one day he got away  for good, and never came back.    All his later life Gainsborough was happy. His daughter, who had  married Fischer, the hautboy-player, came back home to live, and her  disorder was not bad enough to prevent her being a cause of great  happiness to her father. The other daughter never married.  Gainsborough says that he spent a thousand pounds a year, but he also  gave to everybody who asked of him, and to many who asked nothing, so  that he must have made a great deal of money during his lifetime, by  his art. It is said that the \"Boy at the Stile\" was bestowed on  Colonel Hamilton for his fine playing of a solo on the violin. A lady  who had done the artist some trifling service received twenty drawings  as a reward, which she pasted on the walls of her rooms without the  slightest idea of their value.    Gainsborough got up early in the morning, but did not work more than  five hours. He liked his friends, his music, and his wife, and spent  much time with them. He was witty, and while he sketched pictures in  the evening, with his wife and daughters at his side, he kept them  laughing with his droll sayings.    The last days of Gainsborough showed him to be a hero. He died of  cancer, and some time before he knew what his disease was he must have  suffered a great deal. There is a story that is very pathetic of a  dinner with his friends, Beaumont and Sheridan. Usually, he was the  gayest of the gay, but of late all his friends had noticed that gaiety  came to him with effort. Upon the night of this dinner, Sheridan had  been his wittiest, and had tried his hardest to make Gainsborough  cheer up, till finally, the artist, finding it impossible to get out  of his sad mood, asked Sheridan if he would leave the table and speak  with him alone. The two friends went out together. \"Now don't laugh,  but listen,\" Gainsborough said; \"I shall soon die. I know it; I feel  it. I have less time to live than my looks infer, but I do not fear  death. What oppresses my mind is this: I have many acquaintances, few  friends; and as I wish to have one worthy man to accompany me to the  grave, I am desirous of bespeaking you. Will you come? Aye or no!\" At  that Sheridan, who was greatly shocked, tried to cheer him, but  Gainsborough would not return to the table, till he got the promise,  which of course Sheridan made.    It was not very long after this that a famous trial took place--that  of Warren Hastings. It was in Westminster Hall, and Gainsborough went  to listen several times. On the last occasion, he became so interested  in what was happening that he did not notice a window open at his  back. After a little he said to a friend that he \"felt something  inexpressibly cold\" touch his neck. On his return home he told of the  strange feeling to his wife. Then he sent for a doctor, and there was  found a little swelling. The doctor said it was not serious and that  when the weather grew warmer it would disappear; but all the while  Gainsborough felt certain that it would mean his death. A short time  after that he told his sister that he knew himself to have a cancer,  and that was true.    When he felt that he must die, he fell to thinking of many things in  the past, and wished to right certain mistakes of his behaviour as far  as possible.    He sent to Sir Joshua Reynolds and asked him to come and see him,  since he could not go to see Sir Joshua. Reynolds went and then  Gainsborough told him of his regret that he had shown so much ill-will  and jealousy toward so great and worthy a rival. Reynolds was very  generous and tried to make Gainsborough understand that all was  forgiven and forgotten. He left his brother artist much relieved and  happier, and he afterward said: \"The impression on my mind was that  his regret at losing life was principally the regret of leaving his  art.\" As Reynolds left the dying man's room, Gainsborough called after  him: \"We are all going to heaven--and Van Dyck is of the company.\"    He was buried in Kew Churchyard and the ceremonies were followed by  Reynolds and five of the Royal Academicians, who forgot all  Gainsborough's eccentricities of conduct toward them in their honest  grief over his death. He was one of the first three dozen original  members of the Royal Academy.      PLATE--PORTRAIT OF MRS. RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN    This picture is now in the collection of Lord Rothschild,  London. Mrs. Sheridan was the loveliest lady of her time. She was the  daughter of Thomas Linley, and a singer.    She came from a home which was called \"a nest of nightingales,\"  because all in it were musicians. The father had a large family and  made up his mind to become the best musician of his time in his  locality in order to support them. He was successful, and in turn most  of his children became musicians. His lovely daughter, Eliza  (Mrs. Sheridan), he bound to himself as an apprentice and taught her  till she was twenty-one, insisting that she \"serve out her time\" to  him, that she might become a perfect singer. The story of this  beautiful lady seems to belong to the story of Gainsborough's portrait  and shall be told here.    When she was a very little girl, no more than eight years old, she was  so beautiful that as she stood at the door of the pump room in Bath to  sell tickets for her father's concerts, everyone bought them from  her. When she was a very young woman her father engaged her to marry a  Mr. Long, sixty years old. She did not seem to mind what arrangements  her father made for her, but continued to sing and attend to her  business, till after the wedding gowns were all made and everything  ready for the marriage, when she happened to meet the brilliant  Richard Brinsley Sheridan, whose plays were so fashionable, and she  fell deeply in love with him. She told Mr. Long she would not marry  him, and without much objection he gave her up, but her father was  very angry and he threatened to sue Mr. Long for letting his daughter  go. Then the beautiful lady ran away to Calais and married  Mr. Sheridan without her father's permission; but she came home again  and said nothing of what she had done, kept on singing and helping her  father earn money for his family. One day, Mr. Sheridan was wounded in  a duel which he had fought with one of his wife's admirers, and when  she heard the news she screamed, \"my husband, my husband,\" so that  everybody knew she was married to the fascinating playwright. Sheridan  for some reason did not at once come and get her, nor arrange for them  to have a home together. For a good while she continued to sing; and  once hearing her in oratorio, Sheridan fell in love with his wife all  over again. He took her from her home and would never let her sing  again in public. They remarried publicly and went to live in  London. He was not at all a rich and famous man at that time--only a  poor law-student--but he would not let his wife make the fortune she  might easily have made, by singing.    This must have made his beautiful wife very sad, but she made no  complaint at giving up her music and letting him silence her lovely  voice, but turned all her attention to advancing his fortunes. She  worked for him even harder than she had for her father, and that was  saying a great deal. When he became a great writer of plays his wife  took charge of all the accounts of his Drury Lane Theatre, and when he  was in the House of Commons she acted as his secretary. Sheridan died  in great poverty and wretchedness, and it is believed had his  self-sacrificing wife not died before him she would have looked after  his affairs so well that he would not have lost his fortune.  Gainsborough painted the portraits of Sheridan's father-in-law, and of  Samuel Linley; and it was said that this last portrait was painted in  forty-eight minutes. Among his other portraits are: eight of George  III., Sir John Skynner, Admiral Hood, Colonel St. Leger, and \"The Blue  Boy\"; but he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#15)"],[1,"no sense Christian quickly rose to the belief in one controlling spirit.  The Great Spirit became a distinct existence, a pervading power in the  universe, and a dispenser of justice. Many tribes now pray to him,  though still clinging obstinately to their ancient superstitions; and  with some, as the heathen portion of the modern Iroquois, he is clothed  with attributes of moral good. [81]    [80] See \"Divers Sentimens,\" appended to the Relation of 1635, Â§ 27; and  also many other passages of early missionaries.  [81] In studying the writers of the last and of the present century, it  is to be remembered that their observations were made upon savages who  had been for generations in contact, immediate or otherwise, with the  doctrines of Christianity. Many observers have interpreted the religious  ideas of the Indians after preconceived ideas of their own; and it may  safely be affirmed that an Indian will respond with a grunt of  acquiescence to any question whatever touching his spiritual state.  Loskiel and the simple-minded Heckewelder write from a missionary point  of view; Adair, to support a theory of descent from the Jews; the worthy  theologian, Jarvis, to maintain his dogma, that all religious ideas of  the heathen world are perversions of revelation; and so, in a greater or  less degree, of many others. By far the most close and accurate  observers of Indian superstition were the French and Italian Jesuits of  the first half of the seventeenth century. Their opportunities were  unrivalled; and they used them in a spirit of faithful inquiry,  accumulating facts, and leaving theory to their successors. Of recent  American writers, no one has given so much attention to the subject as  Mr. Schoolcraft; but, in view of his opportunities and his zeal, his  results are most unsatisfactory. The work in six large quarto volumes,  History, Condition, and Prospects of Indian Tribes, published by  Government under his editorship, includes the substance of most of his  previous writings. It is a singularly crude and illiterate production,  stuffed with blunders and contradictions, giving evidence on every page  of a striking unfitness either for historical or philosophical inquiry,  and taxing to the utmost the patience of those who would extract what is  valuable in it from its oceans of pedantic verbiage.    The primitive Indian believed in the immortality of the soul, [82] but  he did not always believe in a state of future reward and punishment.  Nor, when such a belief existed, was the good to be rewarded a moral  good, or the evil to be punished a moral evil. Skilful hunters, brave  warriors, men of influence and consideration, went, after death, to the  happy hunting-ground; while the slothful, the cowardly, and the weak  were doomed to eat serpents and ashes in dreary regions of mist and  darkness. In the general belief, however, there was but one land of  shades for all alike. The spirits, in form and feature as they had been  in life, wended their way through dark forests to the villages of the  dead, subsisting on bark and rotten wood. On arriving, they sat all day  in the crouching posture of the sick, and, when night came, hunted the  shades of animals, with the shades of bows and arrows, among the shades  of trees and rocks: for all things, animate and inanimate, were alike  immortal, and all passed together to the gloomy country of the dead.    [82] The exceptions are exceedingly rare. Father Gravier says that a  Peoria Indian once told him that there was no future life. It would be  difficult to find another instance of the kind.    The belief respecting the land of souls varied greatly in different  tribes and different individuals. Among the Hurons there were those who  held that departed spirits pursued their journey through the sky, along  the Milky Way, while the souls of dogs took another route, by certain  constellations, known as the \"Way of the Dogs.\" [83]    [83] Sagard, Voyage des Hurons, 233.    At intervals of ten or twelve years, the Hurons, the Neutrals, and other  kindred tribes, were accustomed to collect the bones of their dead, and  deposit them, with great ceremony, in a common place of burial. The  whole nation was sometimes assembled at this solemnity; and hundreds of  corpses, brought from their temporary resting-places, were inhumed in  one capacious pit. From this hour the immortality of their souls began.  They took wing, as some affirmed, in the shape of pigeons; while the  greater number declared that they journeyed on foot, and in their own  likeness, to the land of shades, bearing with them the ghosts of the  wampum-belts, beaver-skins, bows, arrows, pipes, kettles, beads, and  rings buried with them in the common grave. [84] But as the spirits of  the old and of children are too feeble for the march, they are forced to  stay behind, lingering near their earthly villages, where the living  often hear the shutting of their invisible cabin-doors, and the weak  voices of the disembodied children driving birds from their corn-fields.  [85] An endless variety of incoherent fancies is connected with the  Indian idea of a future life. They commonly owe their origin to dreams,  often to the dreams of those in extreme sickness, who, on awaking,  supposed that they had visited the other world, and related to the  wondering bystanders what they had seen.    [84] The practice of burying treasures with the dead is not peculiar to  the North American aborigines. Thus, the London Times of Oct. 28, 1865,  describing the funeral rites of Lord Palmerston, says: \"And as the  words, 'Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,' were pronounced, the chief  mourner, as a last precious offering to the dead, threw into the grave  several diamond and gold rings.\"  [85] BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1636, 99 (Cramoisy).    The Indian land of souls is not always a region of shadows and gloom.  The Hurons sometimes represented the souls of their dead--those of their  dogs included--as dancing joyously in the presence of Ataentsic and  Jouskeha. According to some Algonquin traditions, heaven was a scene of  endless festivity, the ghosts dancing to the sound of the rattle and the  drum, and greeting with hospitable welcome the occasional visitor from  the living world: for the spirit-land was not far off, and roving  hunters sometimes passed its confines unawares.    Most of the traditions agree, however, that the spirits, on their  journey heavenward, were beset with difficulties and perils. There was a  swift river which must be crossed on a log that shook beneath their  feet, while a ferocious dog opposed their passage, and drove many into  the abyss. This river was full of sturgeon and other fish, which the  ghosts speared for their subsistence. Beyond was a narrow path between  moving rocks, which each instant crashed together, grinding to atoms the  less nimble of the pilgrims who essayed to pass. The Hurons believed  that a personage named Oscotarach, or the Head-Piercer, dwelt in a bark  house beside the path, and that it was his office to remove the brains  from the heads of all who went by, as a necessary preparation for  immortality. This singular idea is found also in some Algonquin  traditions, according to which, however, the brain is afterwards  restored to its owner. [86]    [86] On Indian ideas of another life, compare Sagard, the Jesuit  Relations, Perrot, Charlevoix, and Lafitau, with Tanner, James,  Schoolcraft, and the Appendix to Morse's Indian Report.    Le Clerc recounts a singular story, current in his time among the  Algonquins of GaspÃ© and Northern New Brunswick. The favorite son of an  old Indian died; whereupon the father, with a party of friends, set out  for the land of souls to recover him. It was only necessary to wade  through a shallow lake, several days' journey in extent. This they did,  sleeping at night on platforms of poles which supported them above the  water. At length they arrived, and were met by Papkootparout, the Indian  Pluto, who rushed on them in a rage, with his war-club upraised; but,  presently relenting, changed his mind, and challenged them to a game of  ball. They proved the victors, and won the stakes, consisting of corn,  tobacco, and certain fruits, which thus became known to mankind. The  bereaved father now begged hard for his son's soul, and Papkootparout at  last gave it to him, in the form and size of a nut, which, by pressing  it hard between his hands, he forced into a small leather bag. The  delighted parent carried it back to earth, with instructions to insert  it in the body of his son, who would thereupon return to life. When the  adventurers reached home, and reported the happy issue of their journey,  there was a dance of rejoicing; and the father, wishing to take part in  it, gave his son's soul to the keeping of a squaw who stood by. Being  curious to see it, she opened the bag; on which it escaped at once, and  took flight for the realms of Papkootparout, preferring them to the  abodes of the living.--Le Clerc, Nouvelle Relation de la GaspÃ©sie,  310-328.    Dreams were to the Indian a universal oracle. They revealed to him his  guardian spirit, taught him the cure of his diseases, warned him of the  devices of sorcerers, guided him to the lurking-places of his enemy or  the haunts of game, and unfolded the secrets of good and evil destiny.  The dream was a mysterious and inexorable power, whose least behests  must be obeyed to the letter,--a source, in every Indian town, of  endless mischief and abomination. There were professed dreamers, and  professed interpreters of dreams. One of the most noted festivals among  the Hurons and Iroquois was the Dream Feast, a scene of frenzy, where  the actors counterfeited madness, and the town was like a bedlam turned  loose. Each pretended to have dreamed of something necessary to his  welfare, and rushed from house to house, demanding of all he met to  guess his secret requirement and"]]]
