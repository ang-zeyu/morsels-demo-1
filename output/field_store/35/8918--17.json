By  the searchlight of the present he might have detected things which had  entirely escaped his notice in the past--incriminating things--things  that would put together into a Case. But, after all, what evidence had he  against Raffles as yet? Mr. Levy himself propounded the question with  unflinching candour. He might inform the Metropolitan Police of his  strong suspicions; and they might communicate with the Austrian police,  and evidence beyond the belated evidence of his own senses be duly  forthcoming; but nothing could be done at once, and if Raffles cared to  endorse his theory of the practical joke, by owning up to that and  nothing more, then, so far as Mr. Levy was concerned, nothing should ever  be done at all.    \"Except this little innocent recovery of your own property,\" suggested  Raffles. \"I suppose that's the condition?\"    \"Condition's not the word I should have employed,\" said Levy, with a  shrug.    \"Preliminary, then?\"    \"Indemnity is more the idea. You put me to a lot of trouble by  abstracting Mrs. Levy's jewels for your own amusement--\"    \"So you assert, Mr. Levy.\"    \"Well, I may be wrong; that remains to be seen--or not--as you decide,\"  rejoined the Jew, lifting his mask for the moment. \"At all events you  admit that it's the sort of adventure you would like to try. And so I ask  you to amuse yourself by abstracting something else of mine that 'appens  to have got into the wrong hands; then, I say, we shall be quits.\"    \"Well,\" said Raffles, \"there's no harm in our hearing what sort of  property it is, and where you think it's to be found.\"    The usurer leant forward in his chair; he had long been sitting in the  one which at first he had seemed inclined to wield as a defensive weapon.  We all drew together into a smaller triangle. And I found our visitor  looking specially hard at me for the first time.    \"I've seen you, too, before to-day,\" said he. \"I thought I had, after  you'd gone this morning, and when we met in the afternoon I made sure. It  was at the Savoy when me and my wife were dining there and you gentlemen  were at the next table.\" There was a crafty twinkle in his eye, but the  natural allusion to the necklace was not made. \"I suppose,\" he continued,  \"you are partners in--amusement? Otherwise I should insist on speaking to  Mr. Raffles alone.\"    \"Bunny and I are one,\" said Raffles airily.    \"Though two to one--numerically speaking,\" remarked Levy, with a  disparaging eye on me. \"However, if you're both in the job, so much the  more chance of bringing it off, I daresay. But you'll never 'ave to  'andle a lighter swag, gentlemen!\"    \"More jewellery?\" inquired Raffles, as one thoroughly enjoying the joke.    \"No--lighter than that--a letter!\"    \"One little letter?\"    \"That's all.\"    \"Of your own writing, Mr. Levy?\"    \"No, sir!\" thundered the money-lender, just when I could have sworn his  lips were framing an affirmative.    \"I see; it was written to you, not by you.\"    \"Wrong again, Raffles!\"    \"Then how can the letter be your property, my dear Mr. Levy?\"    There was a pause. The money-lender was at visible grips with some new  difficulty. I watched his heavy but not unhandsome face, and timed the  moment of mastery by the sudden light in his crafty eyes.    \"They think it was written by me,\" said he. \"It's a forgery,  written on my office paper; if that isn't my property, I should  like to know what is?\"    \"It certainly ought to be,\" returned Raffles, sympathetically. \"Of course  you're speaking of the crucial letter in your case against _Fact_?\"    \"I am,\" said Levy, rather startled; \"but 'ow did you know I was?\"    \"I am naturally interested in the case.\"    \"And you've read about it in the papers; they've had a fat sight too much  to say about it, with the whole case still _sub judice_.\"    \"I read the original articles in _Fact_\" said Raffles.    \"And the letters I'm supposed to have written?\"    \"Yes; there was only one of them that struck me as being slap in the  wind's eye.\"    \"That's the one I want.\"    \"If it's genuine, Mr. Levy, it might easily form the basis of a more  serious sort of case.\"    \"But it isn't genuine.\"    \"Nor would you be the first plaintiff in the High Court of Justice,\"  pursued Raffles, blowing soft grey rings into the upper air, \"who has  been rather rudely transformed into the defendant at the Old Bailey.\"    \"But it isn't genuine, I'm telling you!\" cried Dan Levy with a curse.    \"Then what in the world do you want with the letter? Let the prosecution  love and cherish it, and trump it up in court for all it's worth; the  less it is worth, the more certain to explode and blow their case to  bits. A palpable forgery in the hands of Mr. Attorney!\" cried Raffles,  with a wink at me. \"It'll be the best fun of its kind since the late  lamented Mr. Pigott; my dear Bunny, we must both be there.\"    Mr. Levy's uneasiness was a sight for timid eyes. He had presented his  case to us naked and unashamed; already he was in our hands more surely  than Raffles was in his. But Raffles was the last person to betray his  sense of an advantage a second too soon: he merely gave me another  wink. The usurer was frowning at the carpet. Suddenly he sprang up and  burst out in a bitter tirade upon the popular and even the judicial  prejudice against his own beneficent calling. No money-lender would  ever get justice in a British court of law; easier for the camel to  thread the needle's eye. That flagrant forgery would be accepted at  sight by our vaunted British jury. The only chance was to abstract it  before the case came on.    \"But if it can be proved to be a forgery,\" urged Raffles, \"nothing could  possibly turn the tables on the other side with such complete and  instantaneous effect.\"    \"I've told you what I reckon my only chance,\" said Levy fiercely. \"Let me  remind you that it's yours as well!\"    \"If you talk like that,\" said Raffles, \"I shan't consider it.\"    \"You won't in any case, I should hope,\" said I.    \"Oh, yes, I might; but not if he talks like that.\"    Levy stopped talking quite like that.    \"Will you do it, Mr. Raffles, or will you not?\"    \"Abstract the--forgery?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where from?\"    \"Wherever it may be; their solicitors' safe, I suppose.\"    \"Who are the solicitors to _Fact_?\"    \"Burroughs and Burroughs.\"    \"Of Gray's Inn Square?\"    \"That's right.\"    \"The strongest firm in England for a criminal case,\" said Raffles, with a  grimace at me. \"Their strong-room is probably the strongest strong-room!\"    \"I said it was a tricky job,\" rejoined the moneylender.    Raffles looked more than dubious.    \"Big game for a first shoot, eh, Bunny?\"    \"Too big by half.\"    \"And you merely wish to have their letter--withdrawn, Mr. Levy?\"    \"That's the way to put it.\"    And the diamond stud sparkled again as it heaved upon the billows of an  intestine chuckle.    \"Withdrawn--and nothing more?\"    \"That'll be good enough for me, Mr. Raffles.\"    \"Even though they miss it the very next morning?\"    \"Let them miss it.\"    Raffles joined his finger-tips judicially, and shook his head in  serene dissent.    \"It would do you more harm than good, Mr. Levy. I should be inclined to  go one better--if I went into the thing at all,\" he added, with so much  point that I was thankful to think he was beginning to decide against it.    \"What improvement do you suggest?\" inquired Dan Levy, who had evidently  no such premonition.    \"I should take a sheet of your paper with me, and forge the forgery!\"  said Raffles, a light in his eye and a gusto in his voice that I knew  only too well. \"But I shouldn't do my work as perfectly as--the other  cove--did his. My effort would look the same as yours--_his_--until Mr.  Attorney fixed it with his eyeglass in open court. And then the bottom  would be out of the defence in five minutes!\"    Dan Levy came straight over to Raffles--quivering like a jelly--beaming  at every pore.    \"Shake!\" he cried. \"I always knew you were a man after my own heart, but  I didn't know you were a man of genius until this minute.\"    \"It's no use my shaking,\" replied Raffles, the tips of his sensitive  fingers still together, \"until I make up my mind to take on the job. And  I'm a very long way from doing that yet, Mr. Levy.\"    I breathed again.    \"But you must, my dear friend, you simply must!\" said Levy, in a new tone  of pure persuasion. I was sorry he forgot to threaten instead. Perhaps it  was not forgetfulness; perhaps he was beginning to know his Raffles as I  knew mine; if so, I was sorrier still.    \"It's a case of _quid pro quo_,\" said Raffles calmly. \"You can't expect  me to break out into downright crime--however technical the actual  offence--unless you make it worth my while.\"    Levy became the man I wanted him to be again. \"I fancy it's worth your  while not to hear anything more about Carlsbad,\" said he, though still  with less of the old manner than I could have wished.    \"What!\" cried Raffles, \"when you own yourself that you've no evidence  against me there?\"    \"Evidence is to be got that may mean five years to you; don't you make  any mistake about that.\"    \"Whereas the evidence of this particular letter against yourself has, on  your own showing, already been obtained! It's as you like, of course,\"  added Raffles, getting up with a shrug. \"But if the Old Bailey sees us  both, Mr. Levy, I'll back my chance against yours--and your sentence  against mine!\"    Raffles helped himself to a drink, after a quizzical look at his guest,  decanter in hand; the usurer snatched it from him and splashed out half a  tumbler. Certainly he was beginning to know his Raffles perilously well.    \"There, damn you!\" said he, blinking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#15)"],[1,"changed from the paleness of fear to the glow of  hope. Her dread on behalf of her brother was certainly greatly  diminished; yet her form shook, her breathing became short and  irregular, and her whole frame gave tokens of extraordinary agitation.  Her eyes rose from the floor to the dragoon, and were again fixed  immovably on the carpet--she evidently wished to utter something but was  unequal to the effort. Miss Peyton was a close observer of these  movements of her niece, and advancing with an air of feminine dignity,  inquired,--    \"Then, sir, we may expect the pleasure of Major Dunwoodie's company  shortly?\"    \"Immediately, madam,\" answered the dragoon, withdrawing his admiring  gaze from the person of Frances. \"Expresses are already on the road to  announce to him our situation, and the intelligence will speedily bring  him to this valley; unless, indeed, some private reasons may exist to  make a visit particularly unpleasant.\"    \"We shall always be happy to see Major Dunwoodie.\"    \"Oh! doubtless; he is a general favorite, May I presume on it so far as  to ask leave to dismount and refresh my men, who compose a part of his  squadron?\"    There was a manner about the trooper that would have made the omission  of such a request easily forgiven by Mr. Wharton, but he was fairly  entrapped by his own eagerness to conciliate, and it was useless to  withhold a consent which he thought would probably be extorted; he  therefore made the most of necessity, and gave such orders as would  facilitate the wishes of Captain Lawton.    The officers were invited to take their morning's repast at the family  breakfast table, and having made their arrangements without, the  invitation was frankly accepted. None of the watchfulness, which was so  necessary to their situation, was neglected by the wary partisan.  Patrols were seen on the distant hills, taking their protecting circuit  around their comrades, who were enjoying, in the midst of danger, a  security that can only spring from the watchfulness of discipline and  the indifference of habit.    The addition to the party at Mr. Wharton's table was only three, and  they were all of them men who, under the rough exterior induced by  actual and arduous service, concealed the manners of gentlemen.  Consequently, the interruption to the domestic privacy of the family was  marked by the observance of strict decorum. The ladies left the table to  their guests, who proceeded, without much superfluous diffidence, to do  proper honors to the hospitality of Mr. Wharton.    At length Captain Lawton suspended for a moment his violent attacks on  the buckwheat cakes, to inquire of the master of the house, if there was  not a peddler of the name of Birch who lived in the valley at times.    \"At times only, I believe, sir,\" replied Mr. Wharton, cautiously. \"He is  seldom here; I may say I never see him.\"    \"That is strange, too,\" said the trooper, looking at the disconcerted  host intently, \"considering he is your next neighbor; he must be quite  domestic, sir; and to the ladies it must be somewhat inconvenient. I  doubt not that that muslin in the window seat cost twice as much as he  would have asked them for it.\"    Mr. Wharton turned in consternation, and saw some of the recent  purchases scattered about the room.    The two subalterns struggled to conceal their smiles; but the captain  resumed his breakfast with an eagerness that created a doubt, whether he  ever expected to enjoy another. The necessity of a supply from the  dominion of Dinah soon, however, afforded another respite, of which  Lawton availed himself.    \"I had a wish to break this Mr. Birch of his unsocial habits, and gave  him a call this morning,\" he said. \"Had I found him within, I should  have placed him where he would enjoy life in the midst of society, for a  short time at least.\"    \"And where might that be, sir?\" asked Mr. Wharton, conceiving it  necessary to say something.    \"The guardroom,\" said the trooper, dryly.    \"What is the offense of poor Birch?\" asked Miss Peyton, handing the  dragoon a fourth dish of coffee.    \"Poor!\" cried the captain. \"If he is poor, King George is a bad  paymaster.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said one of the subalterns, \"his Majesty owes him a  dukedom.\"    \"And congress a halter,\" continued the commanding officer commencing  anew on a fresh supply of the cakes.    \"I am sorry,\" said Mr. Wharton, \"that any neighbor of mine should incur  the displeasure of our rulers.\"    \"If I catch him,\" cried the dragoon, while buttering another cake, \"he  will dangle from the limbs of one of his namesakes.\"    \"He would make no bad ornament, suspended from one of those locusts  before his own door,\" added the lieutenant.    \"Never mind,\" continued the captain; \"I will have him yet before I'm a  major.\"    As the language of the officers appeared to be sincere, and such as  disappointed men in their rough occupations are but too apt to use, the  Whartons thought it prudent to discontinue the subject. It was no new  intelligence to any of the family, that Harvey Birch was distrusted and  greatly harassed by the American army. His escapes from their hands, no  less than his imprisonments, had been the conversation of the country in  too many instances, and under circumstances of too great mystery, to be  easily forgotten. In fact, no small part of the bitterness expressed by  Captain Lawton against the peddler, arose from the unaccountable  disappearance of the latter, when intrusted to the custody of two of his  most faithful dragoons.    A twelvemonth had not yet elapsed, since Birch had been seen lingering  near the headquarters of the commander in chief, and at a time when  important movements were expected hourly to occur. So soon as the  information of this fact was communicated to the officer whose duty it  was to guard the avenues of the American camp, he dispatched Captain  Lawton in pursuit of the peddler.    Acquainted with all the passes of the hills, and indefatigable in the  discharge of his duty, the trooper had, with much trouble and toil,  succeeded in effecting his object. The party had halted at a farmhouse  for the purposes of refreshment, and the prisoner was placed in a room  by himself, but under the keeping of the two men before mentioned; all  that was known subsequently is, that a woman was seen busily engaged in  the employments of the household near the sentinels, and was  particularly attentive to the wants of the captain, until he was deeply  engaged in the employments of the supper table.    Afterwards, neither woman nor peddler was to be found. The pack, indeed,  was discovered open, and nearly empty, and a small door, communicating  with a room adjoining to the one in which the peddler had been  secured, was ajar.    Captain Lawton never could forgive the deception; his antipathies to his  enemies were not very moderate, but this was adding an insult to his  penetration that rankled deeply. He sat in portentous silence, brooding  over the exploit of his prisoner, yet mechanically pursuing the business  before him, until, after sufficient time had passed to make a very  comfortable meal, a trumpet suddenly broke on the ears of the party,  sending its martial tones up the valley, in startling melody. The  trooper rose instantly from the table, exclaiming,--    \"Quick, gentlemen, to your horses; there comes Dunwoodie,\" and, followed  by his officers, he precipitately left the room.    With the exception of the sentinels left to guard Captain Wharton, the  dragoons mounted, and marched out to meet their comrades.    None of the watchfulness necessary in a war, in which similarity of  language, appearance, and customs rendered prudence doubly necessary,  was omitted by the cautious leader. On getting sufficiently near,  however, to a body of horse of more than double his own number, to  distinguish countenances, Lawton plunged his rowels into his charger,  and in a moment he was by the side of his commander.    The ground in front of the cottage was again occupied by the horse; and  observing the same precautions as before, the newly arrived troops  hastened to participate in the cheer prepared for their comrades.          CHAPTER VI                             And let conquerors boast       Their fields of fame--he who in virtue arms       A young warm spirit against beauty's charms,       Who feels her brightness, yet defies her thrall,       Is the best, bravest conqueror of them all.                                                --MOORE.    The ladies of the Wharton family had collected about a window, deeply  interested in the scene we have related.    Sarah viewed the approach of her countrymen with a smile of contemptuous  indifference; for she even undervalued the personal appearance of men  whom she thought arrayed in the unholy cause of rebellion. Miss Peyton  looked on the gallant show with an exulting pride, which arose in the  reflection that the warriors before her were the chosen troops of her  native colony; while Frances gazed with a singleness of interest that  absorbed all other considerations.    The two parties had not yet joined, before her quick eye distinguished  one horseman in particular from those around him. To her it appeared  that even the steed of this youthful soldier seemed to be conscious that  he sustained the weight of no common man: his hoofs but lightly touched  the earth, and his airy tread was the curbed motion of a  blooded charger.    The dragoon sat in the saddle, with a firmness and ease that showed him  master of himself and horse,--his figure uniting the just proportions of  strength and activity, being tall, round, and muscular. To this officer  Lawton made his report, and, side by side, they rode into the field  opposite to the cottage.    The heart of Frances beat with a pulsation nearly stifling, as he paused  for a moment, and took a survey of the building, with an eye whose dark  and sparkling glance could "]]]
