See page 304. Hugo Grotius, the eminent writer of Holland  in the 17th century, says in his 22d Epistle: \"He that reads  ecclesiastical history, reads nothing but the roguery and folly of  bishops, and churchmen.\" In the language of Robert Taylor, from whom we  have taken most of the quotations under this heading, we assert that  \"no man could quote higher authorities,\" to prove \"the roguery and  folly of bishops and churchmen.\"        CONCLUSION.    Having presented the evidences in support of the apparently untenable  assertion that, notwithstanding the numerous modes in which man has  manifested his devotional proclivities, the world has virtually had but  the one religion founded in the worship of personified nature, we are  necessitated to recognize the facts that the Christian Scriptures like  the sacred records of other forms of nature worship are, but a  collection of astronomical allegories; that the gospel story is truly  \"the old, old story\" which had been told of a thousand other Saviours  before it was applied to the Christian Messiah; that Jesus is but one  of the many names given to imaginary incarnations of the mythical  genius of the sun; and that the Disciples and Evangelists are but the  genii of the months and the seasons. Such being the facts, which cannot  be successfully refuted, we must believe that the Christian religion,  instead of being of Divine authenticity, as popularly claimed, is  purely and entirely of human origin, and that all its teachings  relative to a future state are but priestly inventions, concocted for  the purpose of enslaving the ignorant masses.    When we think of the thousand millions of dollars invested in church  properties, and estimate the cost of maintaining more than a hundred  thousand priests and ministers, in supporting foreign and domestic  missions and in publishing religious literature; besides the taxes  applied to the care of the religious insane, and realize the fact that  all of this vast sum of money is abstracted from the resources of the  people, we would not have to go outside of our own country to  appreciate the fact that religion is the burden of all burdens to  society; and when we contemplate the great disturbance to the social  relation, resulting from sectarian strife, and the almost universal  disposition of Christians to persecute and ostracize those who differ  with them in opinion, we can readily subscribe to the sentiment  accredited to one of our revolutionary sires, that \"this would be a  good world to live in if there was no religion in it.\"    If the clergy had been laboring as faithfully to impress the observance  of ethical principles as they have to indoctrinate the people with the  superstitions of religion, we would not now be deploring the great  demoralization of society. It is a grave arraignment of the clericals  to charge them with being, indirectly, the cause of this lamentable  state of things; but it is a condition that might have been expected,  for, when entering the ministry, they engaged themselves, not so much  to teach ethics as to propagate faith in the doctrines of their  respective sects. Thus hampered they cannot do the good to society  their better natures might desire. Hence the only hope for improvement  is for the people to wholly ignore the dogmatic element of religion,  and refusing to longer support it, demand that moral training shall be  the grand essential of education. If this course were adopted and  persistently followed, it would be but a question of time when mankind  would come into being with such a benign heredity that crime would be  almost impossible.    Then, since religion inculcates a salvation that does not save, let us  rise superior to its false teachings and, accepting science as the true  saviour of mankind, find our whole duty in the code of natural  morality, the spirit of which is embodied in that comprehensive precept  known as the golden rule, which, being the outgrowth of the discovered  necessities of association, without which society could not exist, it  necessarily constituted man's sole rule and guide long before priest or  temple; and founded in the eternal principles of right, truth and  justice must remain as man's sole rule and guide when priest and church  are numbered among the things that were. Spirit of progress! speed the  day when all mankind, redeemed from the bondage of superstition, will  recognize the great truth that nature, governed by her own inherent  forces, is all that has been, all that is and all that shall be; and  that, ceasing to indulge in the vain hope of a blissful immortality in  a paradise beyond the stars, will make a real paradise of this old  earth of ours.      ----------------------------    [1](Editorial note: the original text erroneously attributed this  quote to Genesis 20:8-11; actually it is from Exodus 20:8-11.)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#15)"],[1,"drowned in these pitchers quickly yield their poor little bodies; but  owing to the beetle's hard shell covering, many a rare specimen may be  rescued intact to add to a collection.    A similar ogre plant is the yellow-flowered Trumpet-leaf (_S. flava_)  found in bogs in the Southern states.          SUNDEW FAMILY _(Droseraceae)_      Round-leaved Sundew; Dew-plant    _Drosera rotundifolia_    _Flowers_--Small, white, growing in a 1-sided, curved raceme of buds  chiefly. Calyx usually 5-parted; usually 5 petals, and as many stamens  as petals; usually 3 styles, but 2-cleft, thus appearing to be twice as  many. _Scape:_ 4 to 10 in. high. _Leaves:_ Growing in an open rosette on  the ground; round or broader, clothed with reddish bristly hairs tipped  with purple glands, and narrowed into long, flat, hairy petioles; young  leaves curled like fern fronds.    _Preferred Habitat_--Bogs, sandy and sunny marshes.    _Flowering Season_--July-August.    _Distribution_--Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico and westward. From Alaska  to California. Europe and Asia.    Here is a bloodthirsty little miscreant that lives by reversing the  natural order of higher forms of life preying upon lower ones, an  anomaly in that the vegetable actually eats the animal. The dogbane, as  we shall see, simply catches the flies that dare trespass upon the  butterflies' preserves, for excellent reasons of its own; the Silenes  and phloxes, among others, spread their calices with a sticky gum that  acts as limed twigs do to birds, in order to guard the nectar secreted  for flying benefactors from pilfering ants; the honey bee being an  imported, not a native, insect, and therefore not perfectly adapted to  the milkweed, occasionally gets entrapped by it; the big bumblebee is  sometimes fatally imprisoned in the moccasin flower's gorgeous tomb--the  punishment of insects that do not benefit the flowers is infinite in its  variety. But the local Venus's flytrap (_Dionaea muscipula_), gathered  only from the low savannas in North Carolina to entertain the owners of  hothouses as it promptly closes the crushing trap at the end of its  sensitive leaves over a hapless fly, and the common sundew that tinges  the peat-bogs of three continents with its little reddish leaves, belong  to a distinct class of carnivorous plants which actually masticate their  animal food, depending upon it for nourishment as men do upon cattle  slaughtered in an abattoir. Darwin's luminous account of these two  species alone, which occupies more than three hundred absorbingly  interesting pages of his \"Insectivorous Plants,\" should be read by  every one interested in these freaks of nature.    When we go to some sunny cranberry bog to look for these sundews,  nothing could be more innocent looking than the tiny plant, its nodding  raceme of buds, usually with only a solitary little blossom (that opens  only in the sunshine) at the top of the curve, its leaves glistening  with what looks like dew, though the midsummer sun may be high in the  heavens. A little fly or gnat, attracted by the bright jewels, alights  on a leaf only to find that the clear drops, more sticky than honey,  instantly glue his feet, that the pretty reddish hairs about him act  like tentacles, reaching inward, to imprison him within their slowly  closing embrace. Here is one of the horrors of the Inquisition  operating in this land of liberty before our very eyes! Excited by the  struggles of the victim, the sensitive hairs close only the faster,  working on the same principle that a vine's tendrils do when they come  in contact with a trellis. More of the sticky fluid pours upon the  hapless fly, plastering over his legs and wings and the pores on his  body through which he draws his breath. Slowly, surely, the leaf rolls  inward, making a temporary stomach; the cruel hairs bind, the glue  suffocates and holds him fast. Death alone releases him. And now the  leaf's orgy begins: moistening the fly with a fresh peptic fluid, which  helps in the assimilation, the plant proceeds to digest its food.  Curiously enough, chemical analysis proves that this sundew secrets a  complex fluid corresponding almost exactly to the gastric juice in the  stomach of animals.    Darwin, who fed these leaves with various articles, found that they  could dissolve matter out of pollen, seeds, grass, etc.; yet without a  human caterer, how could a leaf turn vegetarian? When a bit of any  undesirable substance, such as chalk or wood, was placed on the hairs  and excited them, they might embrace it temporarily; but as soon as the  mistake was discovered, it would be dropped! He also poisoned the plants  by administering acids, and gave them fatal attacks of indigestion by  overfeeding them with bits of raw beef!          SAXIFRAGE FAMILY _(Saxifragaceae)_      Early Saxifrage    _Saxifraga virginiensis_    _Flowers_--White, small, numerous, perfect, spreading into a loose  panicle. Calyx 5-lobed; 5 petals; 10 stamens; 1 pistil with 2  styles. _Scape:_ 4 to 12 in. high, naked, sticky-hairy. _Leaves:_  Clustered at the base, rather thick, obovate, toothed, and narrowed  into spatulate-margined petioles. _Fruit:_ Widely spread, purplish  brown pods.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rocky woodlands, hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--March-May.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Georgia, and westward a thousand  miles or more.    Rooted in clefts of rock that, therefore, appears to be broken by this  vigorous plant, the saxifrage shows rosettes of fresh green leaves in  earliest spring, and soon whitens with its blossoms the most forbidding  niches. (_Saxum_ = a rock; _frango_ = I break.) At first a small ball of  green buds nestles in the leafy tuffet, then pushes upward on a bare  scape, opening its tiny, white, five-pointed star flowers as it ascends,  until, having reached the allotted height, it scatters them in spreading  clusters that last a fortnight.      Foam-flower; False Miterwort; Cool wort; Nancy-over-the-Ground    _Tiarella cordifolia_    _Flowers_--White, small, feathery, borne in a close raceme at the top of  a scape 6 to 12 in. high. Calyx white, 5-lobed; 5 clawed petals; 10  stamens, long-exserted; 1 pistil with 2 styles. _Leaves_: Long-petioled  from the rootstock or runners, rounded or broadly heart-shaped, 3 to  7-lobed, toothed, often downy along veins beneath.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods, especially along mountains.    _Flowering Season_--April-May.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Georgia, and westward scarcely to the  Mississippi.    Fuzzy, bright white foam-flowers are most conspicuous in the forest when  seen against their unevenly colored leaves that carpet the ground. A  relative, the true Miterwort or Bishop's Cap (_Mittella diphylla_), with  similar foliage, except that two opposite leaves may be found almost  seated near the middle of its hairy stem, has its flowers rather  distantly scattered on the raceme, and their fine petals deeply cut like  fringe. Both species may be found in bloom at the same time, offering an  opportunity for comparison to the confused novice. Now, _tiarella_,  meaning a little tiara, and _mitella_, a little miter, refer, of  course, to the odd forms of their seed-cases; but all of us are not  gifted with the imaginative eyes of Linnaeus, who named the plants.  Xenophon's assertion that the royal tiara or turban of the Persians was  encircled with a crown helps us no more to see what Linnaeus saw in the  one case than the fact that the papal miter is encircled by three crowns  helps in the other. And as for the lofty, two-peaked cap worn by Bishops  in the Roman Church, a dozen plants, with equal propriety, might be said  to wear it.      Grass of Parnassus    _Parnassia caroliniana_    _Flowers_--Creamy white, delicately veined with greenish, solitary, 1  in. broad or over, at the end of a scape 8 in. to 2 ft. high, 1 ovate  leaf clasping it. Calyx deeply 5-lobed; corolla of 5 spreading, parallel  veined petals; 5 fertile stamens alternating with them, and 3 stout  imperfect stamens clustered at base of each petal; 1 very short pistil  with 4 stigmas. _Leaves:_ From the root, on long petioles, broadly oval  or rounded, heart-shaped at base, rather thick.    _Preferred Habitat_--Wet ground, low meadows, swamps.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Virginia, west to Iowa.    What's in a name? Certainly our common grass of Parnassus, which is no  grass at all, never starred the meadows round about the home of the  Muses, nor sought the steaming savannas of the Carolinas. The European  counterpart (_P. palustris_), fabled to have sprung up on Mount  Parnassus, is at home here only in the Canadian border states and  northward.          WITCH-HAZEL FAMILY _(Hamamelidaceae)_      Witch-hazel    _Hamamelis virginiana_    _Flowers_--Yellow, fringy, clustered in the axils of branches. Calyx  4-parted; 4 very narrow curving petals about 3/4 in. long; 4 short  stamens, also 4 that are scale-like; 2 styles. _Stem_: A tall, crooked  shrub. _Leaves_: Broadly oval, thick, wavy-toothed, mostly fallen at  flowering time. _Fruit_: Woody capsules maturing the next season and  remaining with flowers of the succeeding year (_Hama_ = together with;  _mela_ = fruit).    The literature of Europe is filled with allusions to the witch-hazel,  which, however, is quite distinct from our shrub. Swift wrote:      \"They tell us something strange and odd    About a certain magic rod    That, bending down its top divines    Where'er the soil has hidden mines;    Where there are none, it stands erect    Scorning to show the least respect.\"    A good story is told on Linnaeus in Baring-Gould's \"Curious Myths of  the Middle Ages\": \"When the great botanist was on one of his voyages,  hearing his secretary highly extol the virtues of his divining-wand,  he was willing to convince him of its insufficiency, and for that  purpose concealed a purse of one hundred"]]]
