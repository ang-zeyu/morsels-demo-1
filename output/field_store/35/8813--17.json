Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#15)"],[1,"the lookout  man saw the iceberg and rang the bell three times, the usual signal  from the crow's nest when anything is seen dead-ahead.    By telephone he reported to the bridge the presence of an iceberg, but  Mr. Murdock had already ordered Quartermaster Hichens at the wheel to  starboard the helm, and the vessel began to swing away from the berg.  But it was far too late at the speed she was going to hope to steer  the huge Titanic, over a sixth of a mile long, out of reach of danger.  Even if the iceberg had been visible half a mile away it is doubtful  whether some portion of her tremendous length would not have been  touched, and it is in the highest degree unlikely that the lookout  could have seen the berg half a mile away in the conditions that  existed that night, even with glasses. The very smoothness of the  water made the presence of ice a more difficult matter to detect. In  ordinary conditions the dash of the waves against the foot of an  iceberg surrounds it with a circle of white foam visible for some  distance, long before the iceberg itself; but here was an oily sea  sweeping smoothly round the deadly monster and causing no indication  of its presence.    There is little doubt, moreover, that the crow's nest is not a good  place from which to detect icebergs. It is proverbial that they adopt  to a large extent the colour of their surroundings; and seen from  above at a high angle, with the black, foam-free sea behind, the  iceberg must have been almost invisible until the Titanic was close  upon it. I was much struck by a remark of Sir Ernest Shackleton on his  method of detecting icebergs--to place a lookout man as low down near  the water-line as he could get him. Remembering how we had watched the  Titanic with all her lights out, standing upright like \"an enormous  black finger,\" as one observer stated, and had only seen her thus  because she loomed black against the sky behind her, I saw at once how  much better the sky was than the black sea to show up an iceberg's  bulk. And so in a few moments the Titanic had run obliquely on the  berg, and with a shock that was astonishingly slight--so slight that  many passengers never noticed it--the submerged portion of the berg  had cut her open on the starboard side in the most vulnerable portion  of her anatomy--the bilge. [Footnote: See Figure 4, page 50.] The most  authentic accounts say that the wound began at about the location of  the foremast and extended far back to the stern, the brunt of the blow  being taken by the forward plates, which were either punctured through  both bottoms directly by the blow, or through one skin only, and as  this was torn away it ripped out some of the inner plates. The fact  that she went down by the head shows that probably only the forward  plates were doubly punctured, the stern ones being cut open through  the outer skin only. After the collision, Murdock had at once reversed  the engines and brought the ship to a standstill, but the iceberg had  floated away astern. The shock, though little felt by the enormous  mass of the ship, was sufficient to dislodge a large quantity of ice  from the berg: the forecastle deck was found to be covered with pieces  of ice.    Feeling the shock, Captain Smith rushed out of his cabin to the  bridge, and in reply to his anxious enquiry was told by Murdock that  ice had been struck and the emergency doors instantly closed. The  officers roused by the collision went on deck: some to the bridge;  others, while hearing nothing of the extent of the damage, saw no  necessity for doing so. Captain Smith at once sent the carpenter below  to sound the ship, and Fourth Officer Boxhall to the steerage to  report damage. The latter found there a very dangerous condition of  things and reported to Captain Smith, who then sent him to the  mail-room; and here again, it was easy to see, matters looked very  serious. Mail-bags were floating about and the water rising rapidly.  All this was reported to the captain, who ordered the lifeboats to be  got ready at once. Mr. Boxhall went to the chartroom to work out the  ship's position, which he then handed to the Marconi operators for  transmission to any ship near enough to help in the work of rescue.    Reports of the damage done were by this time coming to the captain  from many quarters, from the chief engineer, from the designer,--Mr.  Andrews,--and in a dramatic way from the sudden appearance on deck of  a swarm of stokers who had rushed up from below as the water poured  into the boiler-rooms and coal-bunkers: they were immediately ordered  down below to duty again. Realizing the urgent heed of help, he went  personally to the Marconi room and gave orders to the operators to get  into touch with all the ships they could and to tell them to come  quickly. The assistant operator Bride had been asleep, and knew of the  damage only when Phillips, in charge of the Marconi room, told him ice  had been encountered. They started to send out the well-known \"C.Q.D.\"  message,--which interpreted means: C.Q. \"all stations attend,\" and D,  \"distress,\" the position of the vessel in latitude and longitude  following. Later, they sent out \"S.O.S.,\" an arbitrary message agreed  upon as an international code-signal.    Soon after the vessel struck, Mr. Ismay had learnt of the nature of  the accident from the captain and chief engineer, and after dressing  and going on deck had spoken to some of the officers not yet  thoroughly acquainted with the grave injury done to the vessel. By  this time all those in any way connected with the management and  navigation must have known the importance of making use of all the  ways of safety known to them--and that without any delay. That they  thought at first that the Titanic would sink as soon as she did is  doubtful; but probably as the reports came in they knew that her  ultimate loss in a few hours was a likely contingency. On the other  hand, there is evidence that some of the officers in charge of boats  quite expected the embarkation was a precautionary measure and they  would all return after daylight. Certainly the first information that  ice had been struck conveyed to those in charge no sense of the  gravity of the circumstances: one officer even retired to his cabin  and another advised a steward to go back to his berth as there was no  danger.    And so the order was sent round, \"All passengers on deck with  lifebelts on\"; and in obedience to this a crowd of hastily dressed or  partially dressed people began to assemble on the decks belonging to  their respective classes (except the steerage passengers who were  allowed access to other decks), tying on lifebelts over their  clothing. In some parts of the ship women were separated from the men  and assembled together near the boats, in others men and women mingled  freely together, husbands helping their own wives and families and  then other women and children into the boats. The officers spread  themselves about the decks, superintending the work of lowering and  loading the boats, and in three cases were ordered by their superior  officers to take charge of them. At this stage great difficulty was  experienced in getting women to leave the ship, especially where the  order was so rigorously enforced, \"Women and children only.\" Women in  many cases refused to leave their husbands, and were actually forcibly  lifted up and dropped in the boats. They argued with the officers,  demanding reasons, and in some cases even when induced to get in were  disposed to think the whole thing a joke, or a precaution which it  seemed to them rather foolish to take. In this they were encouraged by  the men left behind, who, in the same condition of ignorance, said  good-bye to their friends as they went down, adding that they would  see them again at breakfast-time. To illustrate further how little  danger was apprehended--when it was discovered on the first-class deck  that the forward lower deck was covered with small ice, snowballing  matches were arranged for the following morning, and some passengers  even went down to the deck and brought back small pieces of ice which  were handed round.    Below decks too was additional evidence that no one thought of  immediate danger. Two ladies walking along one of the corridors came  across a group of people gathered round a door which they were trying  vainly to open, and on the other side of which a man was demanding in  loud terms to be let out. Either his door was locked and the key not  to be found, or the collision had jammed the lock and prevented the  key from turning. The ladies thought he must be afflicted in some way  to make such a noise, but one of the men was assuring him that in no  circumstances should he be left, and that his (the bystander's) son  would be along soon and would smash down his door if it was not opened  in the mean time. \"He has a stronger arm than I have,\" he added. The  son arrived presently and proceeded to make short work of the door: it  was smashed in and the inmate released, to his great satisfaction and  with many expressions of gratitude to his rescuer. But one of the head  stewards who came up at this juncture was so incensed at the damage  done to the property of his company, and so little aware of the  infinitely greater damage done the ship, that he warned the man who  had released the prisoner that he would be arrested on arrival in New  York.    It must be borne in mind that no general warning had been issued to  passengers: here and there were experienced travellers to whom  collision with an iceberg was sufficient to cause them to make every  preparation for leaving the ship, but the great majority were never  enlightened as to the amount of damage done, or even as to what had  happened. We knew in a vague way that we had collided with an iceberg,  but there our knowledge ended, and most of us drew no deductions from  that fact alone. Another factor that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#15)"],[1,"nce, worried the perplexed officials with  foolish questions, a buzzing that became less muffled and more  pronounced as Elizabeth lifted the edge of the cover and directed  more smoke through the crack. This done, she removed the cover,  set it down on the grass beside her, lifted the super-cover and  applied more smoke, and raised her eyes to where Bill stood  watching. His face wore a smile of pleased interest.    Elizabeth's irritation became painful. She resented his smile. She  hung the smoker on the side of the hive.    'The stool, please, and the screw-driver.'    She seated herself beside the hive and began to loosen the outside  section. Then taking the brood-frame by the projecting ends, she  pulled it out and handed it to her companion. She did it as one  who plays an ace of trumps.    'Would you mind holding this, Mr Chalmers?'    This was the point in the ceremony at which the wretched Nutty had  broken down absolutely, and not inexcusably, considering the  severity of the test. The surface of the frame was black with what  appeared at first sight to be a thick, bubbling fluid of some  sort, pouring viscously to and fro as if some hidden fire had been  lighted beneath it. Only after a closer inspection was it apparent  to the lay eye that this seeming fluid was in reality composed of  mass upon mass of bees. They shoved and writhed and muttered and  jostled, for all the world like a collection of home-seeking City  men trying to secure standing room on the Underground at half-past  five in the afternoon.    Nutty, making this discovery, had emitted one wild yell, dropped  the frame, and started at full speed for the house, his retreat  expedited by repeated stings from the nervous bees. Bill, more  prudent, remained absolutely motionless. He eyed the seething  frame with interest, but without apparent panic.    'I want you to help me here, Mr Chalmers. You have stronger wrists  than I have. I will tell you what to do. Hold the frame tightly.'    'I've got it.'    'Jerk it down as sharply as you can to within a few inches of the  door, and then jerk it up again. You see, that shakes them off.'    'It would me,' agreed Bill, cordially, 'if I were a bee.'    Elizabeth had the feeling that she had played her ace of trumps  and by some miracle lost the trick. If this grisly operation did  not daunt the man, nothing, not even the transferring of honey,  would. She watched him as he raised the frame and jerked it down  with a strong swiftness which her less powerful wrists had never  been able to achieve. The bees tumbled off in a dense shower,  asking questions to the last; then, sighting the familiar entrance  to the hive, they bustled in without waiting to investigate the  cause of the earthquake.    Lord Dawlish watched them go with a kindly interest.    'It has always been a mystery to me,' he said, 'why they never  seem to think of manhandling the Johnny who does that to them.  They don't seem able to connect cause and effect. I suppose the  only way they can figure it out is that the bottom has suddenly  dropped out of everything, and they are so busy lighting out for  home that they haven't time to go to the root of things. But it's  a ticklish job, for all that, if you're not used to it. I know  when I first did it I shut my eyes and wondered whether they would  bury my remains or cremate them.'    'When you first did it?' Elizabeth was staring at him blankly.  'Have you done it before?'    Her voice shook. Bill met her gaze frankly.    'Done it before? Rather! Thousands of times. You see, I spent a  year on a bee-farm once, learning the business.'    For a moment mortification was the only emotion of which Elizabeth  was conscious. She felt supremely ridiculous. For this she had  schemed and plotted--to give a practised expert the opportunity of  doing what he had done a thousand times before!    And then her mood changed in a flash. Nature has decreed that  there are certain things in life which shall act as hoops of  steel, grappling the souls of the elect together. Golf is one of  these; a mutual love of horseflesh another; but the greatest of  all is bees. Between two beekeepers there can be no strife. Not  even a tepid hostility can mar their perfect communion.    The petty enmities which life raises to be barriers between man  and man and between man and woman vanish once it is revealed to  them that they are linked by this great bond. Envy, malice,  hatred, and all uncharitableness disappear, and they look into  each other's eyes and say 'My brother!'    The effect of Bill's words on Elizabeth was revolutionary. They  crashed through her dislike, scattering it like an explosive  shell. She had resented this golden young man's presence at the  farm. She had thought him in the way. She had objected to his  becoming aware that she did such prosaic tasks as cooking and  washing-up. But now her whole attitude toward him was changed. She  reflected that he was there. He could stay there as long as he  liked, the longer the better.    'You have really kept bees?'    'Not actually kept them, worse luck! I couldn't raise the capital.  You see, money was a bit tight--'    'I know,' said Elizabeth, sympathetically. 'Money is like that,  isn't it?'    'The general impression seemed to be that I should be foolish to  try anything so speculative as beekeeping, so it fell through.  Some very decent old boys got me another job.'    'What job?'    'Secretary to a club.'    'In London, of course?'    'Yes.'    'And all the time you wanted to be in the country keeping bees!'    Elizabeth could hardly control her voice, her pity was so great.    'I should have liked it,' said Bill, wistfully. 'London's all  right, but I love the country. My ambition would be to have a  whacking big farm, a sort of ranch, miles away from anywhere--'    He broke off. This was not the first time he had caught himself  forgetting how his circumstances had changed in the past few  weeks. It was ridiculous to be telling hard-luck stories about not  being able to buy a farm, when he had the wherewithal to buy  dozens of farms. It took a lot of getting used to, this business  of being a millionaire.    'That's my ambition too,' said Elizabeth, eagerly. This was the  very first time she had met a congenial spirit. Nutty's views on  farming and the Arcadian life generally were saddening to an  enthusiast. 'If I had the money I should get an enormous farm, and  in the summer I should borrow all the children I could find, and  take them out to it and let them wallow in it.'    'Wouldn't they do a lot of damage?'    'I shouldn't mind. I should be too rich to worry about the damage.  If they ruined the place beyond repair I'd go and buy another.'  She laughed. 'It isn't so impossible as it sounds. I came very  near being able to do it.' She paused for a moment, but went on  almost at once. After all, if you cannot confide your intimate  troubles to a fellow bee-lover, to whom can you confide them? 'An  uncle of mine--'    Bill felt himself flushing. He looked away from her. He had a  sense of almost unbearable guilt, as if he had just done some  particularly low crime and was contemplating another.    '--An uncle of mine would have left me enough money to buy all the  farms I wanted, only an awful person, an English lord. I wonder if  you have heard of him?--Lord Dawlish--got hold of uncle somehow  and induced him to make a will leaving all the money to him.'    She looked at Bill for sympathy, and was touched to see that he  was crimson with emotion. He must be a perfect dear to take other  people's misfortunes to heart like that.    'I don't know how he managed it,' she went on. 'He must have  worked and plotted and schemed, for Uncle Ira wasn't a weak sort  of man whom you could do what you liked with. He was very  obstinate. But, anyway, this Lord Dawlish succeeded in doing it  somehow, and then'--her eyes blazed at the recollection--'he had  the insolence to write to me through his lawyers offering me half.  I suppose he was hoping to satisfy his conscience. Naturally I  refused it.'    'But--but--but why?'    'Why! Why did I refuse it? Surely you don't think I was going to  accept charity from the man who had cheated me?'    'But--but perhaps he didn't mean it like that. What I mean to say  is--as charity, you know.'    'He did! But don't let's talk of it any more. It makes me angry to  think of him, and there's no use spoiling a lovely day like this  by getting angry.'    Bill sighed. He had never dreamed before that it could be so  difficult to give money away. He was profoundly glad that he had  not revealed his identity, as he had been on the very point of  doing just when she began her remarks. He understood now why that  curt refusal had come in answer to his lawyer's letter. Well,  there was nothing to do but wait and hope that time might  accomplish something.    'What do you want me to do next?' he said. 'Why did you open the  hive? Did you want to take a look at the queen?'    Elizabeth hesitated. She blushed with pure shame. She had had but  one motive in opening the hive, and that had been to annoy him.  She scorned to take advantage of the loophole he had provided.  Beekeeping is a freemasonry. A beekeeper cannot deceive a  brother-mason.    She faced him bravely.    'I didn't want to take a look at anything, Mr Chalmers. I opened  that hive because I wanted you to drop the frame, as my brother  did, and get stung, as he was; because I thought that would drive  you away, because I thought then that I didn't want you down here.  I'm ashamed of myself, and I don't know where I'm getting the  nerve to tell you this. I hope you will stay on--on and on and  on.'    Bill was aghast.    'Good Lord! If I'm in the way--'    'You aren't in the way.'    'But you said--'    'But don't you see that it's so different now? I didn't know then  that you were fond of bees. You must stay, if my telling you  hasn't made you feel that"]]]
