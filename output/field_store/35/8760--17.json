[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#15)"],[1,". Now, Mr. Gilwaters, the similarity in names is too  striking to be devoid of significance. So--it's of the utmost importance  to me!--can or will you tell me--who was the Mary Bewery you married to  John Brake? Who was John Brake? And what was Mark Ransford to either, or  to both?\"    He was wondering, all the time during which he reeled off these  questions, if Mr. Gilwaters was wholly ignorant of the recent affair  at Wrychester. He might be--a glance round his book-filled room had  suggested to Bryce that he was much more likely to be a bookworm than a  newspaper reader, and it was quite possible that the events of the day  had small interest for him. And his first words in reply to Bryce's  questions convinced Bryce that his surmise was correct and that the  old man had read nothing of the Wrychester Paradise mystery, in which  Ransford's name had, of course, figured as a witness at the inquest.    \"It is nearly twenty years since I heard any of their names,\" remarked  Mr. Gilwaters. \"Nearly twenty years--a long time! But, of course, I can  answer you. Mary Bewery was our governess at Braden Medworth. She came  to us when she was nineteen--she was married four years later. She was a  girl who had no friends or relatives--she had been educated at a school  in the North--I engaged her from that school, where, I understood, she  had lived since infancy. Now then, as to Brake and Ransford. They were  two young men from London, who used to come fishing in Leicestershire.  Ransford was a few years the younger--he was either a medical student in  his last year, or he was an assistant somewhere in London. Brake--was a  bank manager in London--of a branch of one of the big banks. They  were pleasant young fellows, and I used to ask them to the vicarage.  Eventually, Mary Bewery and John Brake became engaged to be married. My  wife and I were a good deal surprised--we had believed, somehow, that  the favoured man would be Ransford. However, it was Brake--and Brake she  married, and, as you say, Ransford was best man. Of course, Brake took  his wife off to London--and from the day of her wedding, I never saw her  again.\"    \"Did you ever see Brake again?\" asked Bryce. The old clergyman shook his  head.    \"Yes!\" he said sadly. \"I did see Brake again--under grievous, grievous  circumstances!\"    \"You won't mind telling me what circumstances?\" suggested Bryce. \"I will  keep your confidence, Mr. Gilwaters.\"    \"There is really no secret in it--if it comes to that,\" answered the old  man. \"I saw John Brake again just once. In a prison cell!\"    \"A prison cell!\" exclaimed Bryce. \"And he--a prisoner?\"    \"He had just been sentenced to ten years' penal servitude,\" replied Mr.  Gilwaters. \"I had heard the sentence--I was present. I got leave to see  him. Ten years' penal servitude!--a terrible punishment. He must have  been released long ago--but I never heard more.\"    Bryce reflected in silence for a moment--reckoning and calculating.    \"When was this--the trial?\" he asked.    \"It was five years after the marriage--seventeen years ago,\" replied Mr.  Gilwaters.    \"And--what had he been doing?\" inquired Bryce.    \"Stealing the bank's money,\" answered the old man. \"I forget what the  technical offence was--embezzlement, or something of that sort. There  was not much evidence came out, for it was impossible to offer any  defence, and he pleaded guilty. But I gathered from what I heard that  something of this sort occurred. Brake was a branch manager. He was, as  it were, pounced upon one morning by an inspector, who found that his  cash was short by two or three thousand pounds. The bank people seemed  to have been unusually strict and even severe--Brake, it was said, had  some explanation, but it was swept aside and he was given in charge. And  the sentence was as I said just now--a very savage one, I thought.  But there had recently been some bad cases of that sort in the banking  world, and I suppose the judge felt that he must make an example. Yes--a  most trying affair!--I have a report of the case somewhere, which I cut  out of a London newspaper at the time.\"    Mr. Gilwaters rose and turned to an old desk in the corner of his  room, and after some rummaging of papers in a drawer, produced a  newspaper-cutting book and traced an insertion in its pages. He handed  the book to his visitor.    \"There is the account,\" he said. \"You can read it for yourself. You will  notice that in what Brake's counsel said on his behalf there are one or  two curious and mysterious hints as to what might have been said if it  had been of any use or advantage to say it. A strange case!\"    Bryce turned eagerly to the faded scrap of newspaper.                    BANK MANAGER'S DEFALCATION.      At the Central Criminal Court yesterday, John Brake,    thirty-three, formerly manager of the Upper Tooting    branch of the London & Home Counties Bank, Ltd.,    pleaded guilty to embezzling certain sums, the    property of his employers.      Mr. Walkinshaw, Q.C., addressing the court on behalf    of the prisoner, said that while it was impossible    for his client to offer any defence, there were    circumstances in the case which, if it had been worth    while to put them in evidence, would have shown that    the prisoner was a wronged and deceived man.  To use    a Scriptural phrase, Brake had been wounded in the    house of his friend.  The man who was really guilty    in this affair had cleverly escaped all consequences,    nor would it be of the least use to enter into any    details respecting him.  Not one penny of the money    in question had been used by the prisoner for his own    purposes.  It was doubtless a wrong and improper thing    that his client had done, and he had pleaded guilty and    would submit to the consequences.  But if everything in    connection with the case could have been told, if it    would have served any useful purpose to tell it, it    would have been seen that what the prisoner really was    guilty of was a foolish and serious error of judgment.    He himself, concluded the learned counsel, would go so    far as to say that, knowing what he did, knowing what    had been told him by his client in strict confidence,    the prisoner, though technically guilty, was morally    innocent.      His Lordship, merely remarking that no excuse of any    sort could be offered in a case of this sort, sentenced    the prisoner to ten years' penal servitude.    Bryce read this over twice before handing back the book.    \"Very strange and mysterious, Mr. Gilwaters,\" he remarked. \"You say that  you saw Brake after the case was over. Did you learn anything?\"    \"Nothing whatever!\" answered the old clergyman. \"I got permission to see  him before he was taken away. He did not seem particularly pleased or  disposed to see me. I begged him to tell me what the real truth was. He  was, I think, somewhat dazed by the sentence--but he was also sullen  and morose. I asked him where his wife and two children--one, a mere  infant--were. For I had already been to his private address and  had found that Mrs. Brake had sold all the furniture and  disappeared--completely. No one--thereabouts, at any rate--knew where  she was, or would tell me anything. On my asking this, he refused to  answer. I pressed him--he said finally that he was only speaking the  truth when he replied that he did not know where his wife was. I said I  must find her. He forbade me to make any attempt. Then I begged him  to tell me if she was with friends. I remember very well what he  replied.--'I'm not going to say one word more to any man living,  Mr. Gilwaters,' he answered determinedly. 'I shall be dead to the  world--only because I've been a trusting fool!--for ten years or  thereabouts, but, when I come back to it, I'll let the world see what  revenge means! Go away!' he concluded. 'I won't say one word more.'  And--I left him.\"    \"And--you made no more inquiries?--about the wife?\" asked Bryce.    \"I did what I could,\" replied Mr. Gilwaters. \"I made some inquiry in  the neighbourhood in which they had lived. All I could discover was  that Mrs. Brake had disappeared under extraordinarily mysterious  circumstances. There was no trace whatever of her. And I speedily found  that things were being said--the usual cruel suspicions, you know.\"    \"Such as--what?\" asked Bryce.    \"That the amount of the defalcations was much larger than had been  allowed to appear,\" replied Mr. Gilwaters. \"That Brake was a very clever  rogue who had got the money safely planted somewhere abroad, and that  his wife had gone off somewhere--Australia, or Canada, or some other  far-off region--to await his release. Of course, I didn't believe  one word of all that. But there was the fact--she had vanished! And  eventually, I thought of Ransford, as having been Brake's great friend,  so I tried to find him. And then I found that he, too, who up to  that time had been practising in a London suburb--Streatham--had also  disappeared. Just after Brake's arrest, Ransford had suddenly sold his  practice and gone--no one knew where, but it was believed--abroad. I  couldn't trace him, anyway. And soon after that I had a long illness,  and for two or three years was an invalid, and--well, the thing was over  and done with, and, as I said just now, I have never heard anything of  any of them for all these years. And now!--now you tell me that there  is a Mary Bewery who is a ward of a Dr. Mark Ransford at--where did you  say?\"    \"At Wrychester,\" answered Bryce. \"She is a young woman of twenty, and  she has a brother, Richard, who is between seventeen and eighteen.\"    \"Without a doubt those are Brake's children!\" exclaimed the old man.  \"The infant I spoke of was a boy. Bless me!--how extraordinary. How long  have they been at Wrychester?\"    \"Ransford has been in practice there some years--a few years,\" replied  Bryce. \"These two young people joined him there definitely two years  ago. But from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#15)"],[1,"is fine in its way, but  it must come to an end some day. A man needs to put down a root  somewhere to be really happy.    What absurd victims of contrary desires we are! If a man is settled  in one place he yearns to wander; when he wanders he yearns to have  a home. And yet how bestial is content--all the great things in life  are done by discontented people.    There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning,  and yearning. A man should be learning as he goes; and he should  be earning bread for himself and others; and he should be yearning,  too: yearning to know the unknowable.    What a fine old poem is \"The Pulley\" by George Herbert! Those  Elizabethan fellows knew how to write! They were marred perhaps by  their idea that poems must be \"witty.\" (Remember how Bacon said  that reading poets makes one witty? There he gave a clue to the  literature of his time.)  Their fantastic puns and conceits are  rather out of our fashion nowadays. But Lord! the root of the  matter was in them! How gallantly, how reverently, they tackle the  problems of life!    When God at first made man (says George Herbert) He had a \"glass of  blessings standing by.\" So He pours on man all the blessings in His  reservoir: strength, beauty, wisdom, honour, pleasure--and then He  refrains from giving him the last of them, which is rest, i.e.,  contentment. God sees that if man is contented he will never win  his way to Him. Let man be restless, so that      \"If goodness lead him not, yet weariness       May toss him to My breast.\"    Some day I shall write a novel on that theme, and call it \"The  Pulley.\" In this tragic, restless world there must be some  place where at last we can lay our heads and be at rest. Some  people call it death. Some call it God.    My ideal of a man is not the Omar who wants to shatter into bits  this sorry scheme of things, and then remould it nearer to the  heart's desire. Old Omar was a coward, with his silk pajamas and  his glass of wine. The real man is George Herbert's \"seasoned  timber\"--the fellow who does handily and well whatever comes to him.  Even if it's only shovelling coal into a furnace he can balance the  shovel neatly, swing the coal square on the fire and not spill it on  the floor. If it's only splitting kindling or running a trolley car  he can make a good, artistic job of it. If it's only writing a book  or peeling potatoes he can put into it the best he has. Even if he's  only a bald-headed old fool over forty selling books on a country  road, he can make an ideal of it. Good old Parnassus! It's a great  game.... I think I'll have to give her up soon, though: I must get  that book of mine written. But Parnassus has been a true glass of  blessings to me.      There was much more in the notebook; indeed it was half full of  jotted paragraphs, memoranda, and scraps of writing--poems I believe  some of them were--but I had seen enough. It seemed as if I had  stumbled unawares on the pathetic, brave, and lonely heart of the  little man. I'm a commonplace creature, I'm afraid, insensible to  many of the deeper things in life, but every now and then, like all  of us, I come face to face with something that thrills me. I saw how  this little, red-bearded pedlar was like a cake of yeast in the big,  heavy dough of humanity: how he travelled about trying to fulfil in  his own way his ideals of beauty. I felt almost motherly toward him:  I wanted to tell him that I understood him. And in a way I felt  ashamed of having run away from my own homely tasks, my kitchen and  my hen yard and dear old, hot-tempered, absent-minded Andrew. I  fell into a sober mood. As soon as I was alone, I thought, I would  sell Parnassus and hurry back to the farm. That was my job, that  was my glass of blessings. What was I doing--a fat, middle-aged  woman--trapesing along the roads with a cartload of books I didn't  understand?    I slipped the little notebook back into its hiding-place. I would  have died rather than let the Professor know I had seen it.        CHAPTER ELEVEN      We were coming into Woodbridge; and I was just wondering whether to  wake the Professor when the little window behind me slid back and he  stuck his head out.    \"Hello!\" he said. \"I think I must have been asleep!\"    \"Well, I should hope so,\" I said. \"You needed it.\"    Indeed he looked much better, and I was relieved to see it. I had  been really afraid he would be ill after sleeping out all night, but  I guess he was tougher than I thought. He joined me on the seat, and  we drove into the town. While he went to the station to ask about  the trains I had a fine time selling books. I was away from the  locality where I was known, and had no shyness in attempting to  imitate Mifflin's methods. I even went him one better by going into  a hardware store where I bought a large dinner bell. This I rang  lustily until a crowd gathered, then I put up the flaps and  displayed my books. As a matter of fact, I sold only one, but I  enjoyed myself none the less.    By and by Mifflin reappeared. I think he had been to a barber: at  any rate he looked very spry: he had bought a clean collar and a  flowing tie of a bright electric blue which really suited him rather  well.    \"Well,\" he said, \"the Sage is going to get back at me for that  punch on the nose! I've been to the bank to cash your check. They  telephoned over to Redfield, and apparently your brother has stopped  payment on it. It's rather awkward: they seem to think I'm a crook.\"    I was furious. What right had Andrew to do that?    \"The brute!\" I said. \"What on earth shall I do?\"    \"I suggest that you telephone to the Redfield Bank,\" he said, \"and  countermand your brother's instructions--that is, unless you think  you've made a mistake? I don't want to take advantage of you.\"    \"Nonsense!\" I said. \"I'm not going to let Andrew spoil my holiday.  That's always his way: if he gets an idea into his head he's like a  mule. I'll telephone to Redfield, and then we'll go to see the bank  here.\"    We put Parnassus up at the hotel, and I went to the telephone. I was  thoroughly angry at Andrew, and tried to get him on the wire first.  But Sabine Farm didn't answer. Then I telephoned to the bank in  Redfield, and got Mr. Shirley. He's the cashier, and I know him  well. I guess he recognized my voice, for he made no objection when  I told him what I wanted.    \"Now you telephone to the bank in Woodbridge,\" I said, \"and tell  them to let Mr. Mifflin have the money. I'll go there with him to  identify him. Will that be all right?\"    \"Perfectly,\" he said. The deceitful little snail! If I had only  known what he was concocting!    Mifflin said there was a train at three o'clock which he could take.  We stopped at a little lunch room for a bite to eat, then he went  again to the bank, and I with him. We asked the cashier whether they  had had a message from Redfield.    \"Yes,\" he said. \"We've just heard.\" And he looked at me rather  queerly.    \"Are you Miss McGill?\" he said.    \"I am,\" I said.    \"Will you just step this way a moment?\" he asked politely.    He led me into a little sitting-room and asked me to sit down. I  supposed that he was going to get some paper for me to sign, so I  waited quite patiently for several minutes. I had left the Professor  at the cashier's window, where they would give him his money.    I waited some time, and finally I got tired of looking at the Life  Insurance calendars. Then I happened to glance out of the window.  Surely that was the Professor, just disappearing round the corner  with another man?    I returned to the cashier's desk.    \"What's the matter?\" I said. \"Your mahogany furniture is charming,  but I'm tired of it. Do I have to sit here any longer? And where's  Mr. Mifflin? Did he get his money?\"    The cashier was a horrid little creature with side whiskers.    \"I'm sorry you had to wait, Madam,\" he said. \"The transaction is  just concluded. We gave Mr. Mifflin what was due him. There is no  need for you to stay longer.\"    I thought this was very extraordinary. Surely the Professor would  not leave without saying good-bye? However, I noticed that the clock  said three minutes to three, so I thought that perhaps he had had to  run to catch his train. He was such a strange little man, anyway....    Well, I went back to the hotel, quite a little upset by this sudden  parting. At least I was glad the little man had got his money all  right. Probably he would write from Brooklyn, but of course I  wouldn't get the letter till I returned to the farm as that was the  only address he would have. Perhaps that wouldn't be so long after  all: but I did not feel like going back now, when Andrew had been  so horrid.    I drove Parnassus on the ferry, and we crossed the river. I felt  lost and disagreeable. Even the fresh movement through the air  gave me no pleasure. Bock whined dismally inside the van.    It didn't take me long to discover that Parnassing all alone had  lost some of its charms. I missed the Professor: missed his abrupt,  direct way of saying things, and his whimsical wit. And I was  annoyed by his skipping off without a word of good-bye. It didn't  seem natural. I partially appeased my irritation by stopping at a  farmhouse on the other side of the river and selling a cook book.  Then I started along the road for Bath--about five miles farther on.  Peg's foot didn't seem to bother her so I thought it would be safe  to travel that far before stopping for the night. Counting up the  days (with some difficulty: it seemed as though I had been away from  home a month), I remembered that this was Saturday night. I thought  I would stay in Bath over Sunday and get a good rest. We jogged  sedately along the road, and I got out a copy of \"Vanity Fair.\" I  was so absorbed in Becky Sharp that I wouldn't even interrupt myself  to sell books at the houses we passed. I think reading a good book  makes one modest. When you see the"]]]
