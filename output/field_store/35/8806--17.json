It was a great disappointment to Elsie, and for a few moments her heart  rose up in rebellion against her father. She tried to put away the  feeling, but it would come back; for she could not imagine any reason  for his refusal to let her go, excepting the disobedience of the day  before, and it seemed hard and unjust to punish her twice for the same  fault, especially as he would have known nothing about it but for her  own frank and voluntary confession. It was a great pity she had not  heard the reasons he gave her Aunt Adelaide, for then she would have  been quite submissive and content. It is indeed true that she ought to  have been as it was; but our little Elsie, though sincerely desirous to  do right, was not yet perfect, and had already strangely forgotten the  lesson of the morning.    She watched from the veranda the departure of the pleasure-seekers, all  apparently in the gayest spirits. She was surprised to see that her  father was not with them, and it half reconciled her to staying at  home, although she hardly expected to see much of him; but there was  something pleasant in the thought that he wanted her at home because he  was to be there himself; it looked as though he really had some  affection for her, and even a selfish love was better than none. I do  not mean that these were Elsie's thoughts; no, she never would have  dreamed of calling her father selfish; but the undefined feeling was  there, as she watched him hand the ladies into the carriage, and then  turn and reenter the house as they drove off.    But Miss Day's bell rang, and Elsie gathered up her books and hastened  to the school-room. Her patience and endurance were sorely tried that  morning, for Miss Day was in an exceedingly bad humor, being greatly  mortified and also highly indignant that she had not been invited to  make one of the picnic party; and Elsie had never found her more  unreasonable and difficult to please; and her incessant fault-finding  and scolding were almost more than the little girl could bear in  addition to her own sad disappointment. But at last the morning, which  had seldom seemed so long, was over, and Elsie dismissed from the  school-room for the day.    At dinner, instead of the usual large party, there were only her father  and the gentleman with whom he was transacting business, Miss Day, and  herself.    The gentleman was not one of those who care to notice children, but  continued to discuss business and politics with Mr. Dinsmore, without  seeming to be in the least aware of the presence of the little girl,  who sat in perfect silence, eating whatever her father saw fit to put  upon her plate; and Elsie was very glad indeed when at length Miss Day  rose to leave the table, and her papa told her she might go too.    He called her back though, before she had gone across the room, to say  that he had intended to ride with her that afternoon, but found he  should not be able to do so, and she must take Jim for a protector, as  he did not wish her either to miss her ride or to go entirely alone.    He spoke very kindly; Elsie thought with remorse of the rebellious  feelings of the morning, and, had she been alone with her father, would  certainly have confessed them, expressing her sorrow and asking  forgiveness; but she could not do so before a third person, more  especially a stranger; and merely saying, \"Yes, papa, I will,\" she  turned away and left the room. Jim was bringing up her horse as she  passed the open door; and she hastened up-stairs to prepare for her  ride.    \"O mammy!\" she suddenly exclaimed, as Chloe was trying on her hat, \"is  Pomp going to the city to-day?\"    \"Yes, darlin', he gwine start directly,\" said Chloe, arranging her  nursling's curls to better advantage, and finishing her work with a  fond caress.    \"Oh! then, mammy, take some money out of my purse, and tell him to buy  me a pound of the very nicest candy he can find,\" said the little girl,  eagerly. \"I haven't had any for a long time, and I feel hungry for it  to-day. What they had bought for the picnic looked so good, but you  know I didn't get any of it.\"    The picnic party returned just before tea-time, and Lucy Carrington  rushed into Elsie's room eager to tell her what a delightful day they  had had. She gave a very glowing account of their sports and  entertainment, interrupting herself every now and then to lament over  Elsie's absence, assuring her again and again that it had been the only  drawback upon her own pleasure, and that she thought that Elsie's papa  was very unkind indeed to refuse her permission to go. As Elsie  listened the morning's feelings of vexation and disappointment returned  in full force; and though she said nothing, she allowed her friend to  accuse her father of cruelty and injustice without offering any  remonstrance.    In the midst of their talk the tea-bell rang, and they hurried down to  take their places at the table, where Lucy went on with her narrative,  though in a rather subdued tone, Elsie now and then asking a question,  until Mr. Dinsmore turned to his daughter, saying, in his stern way,  \"Be quiet, Elsie; you are talking entirely too much for a child of your  age; don't let me hear you speak again until you have left the table.\"    Elsie's face flushed, and her eyes fell, under the rebuke; and during  the rest of the meal not a sound escaped her lips.    \"Come, Elsie, let us go into the garden and finish our talk,\" said  Lucy, putting her arm affectionately around her friend's waist as they  left the table; \"your papa can't hear us there, and we'll have a good  time.\"    \"Papa only stopped us because we were talking too much at the table,\"  said Elsie, apologetically; \"I'm sure he is willing you should tell me  all about what a nice time you all had. But, Lucy,\" she added, lowering  her voice, \"please don't say again that you think papa was unkind to  keep me at home to-day. I'm sure he knows best, and I ought not to have  listened to a word of that kind about him.\"    \"O! well, never mind, I won't talk so any more,\" said Lucy,  good-naturedly, as they skipped down the walk together; \"but I do think  he's cross, and I wish you were my sister, that you might have my kind,  good papa for yours too,\" she added, drawing her arm more closely about  her friend's waist.    \"Thank you, Lucy,\" said Elsie, with a little sigh, \"I would like to be  your sister, but indeed I would not like to give up my own dear papa,  for I love him, oh! _so_ much.\"    \"Why, how funny, when he's so cross to you!\" exclaimed Lucy, laughing.    Elsie put her hand over her friend's mouth, and Lucy pushed it away,  saying, \"Excuse me; I forgot; but I'll try not to say it again.\"    While the little girls were enjoying their talk in the garden, a  servant with a small bundle in her hand came out on the veranda, where  Mr. Horace Dinsmore was sitting smoking a cigar, and, casting an  inquiring glance around, asked if he knew where Miss Elsie was?    \"What do you want with her?\" he asked.    \"Only to give her dis bundle, massa, dat Pomp jus brought from de city.\"    \"Give it to me,\" he said, extending his hand to receive it.    A few moments afterward Elsie and her friend returned to the house, and  meeting Pomp, she asked him if he had brought her candy.    He replied that he had got some that was very nice indeed, and he  thought that Fanny had carried it to her; and seeing Fanny near, he  called to her to know what she had done with it.    \"Why, Pomp, Massa Horace he told me to give it to him,\" said the girl.    Elsie turned away with a very disappointed look.    \"You'll go and ask him for it, won't you?\" asked Lucy, who was anxious  to enjoy a share of the candy as well as to see Elsie gratified.    \"No,\" said Elsie, sighing, \"I had rather do without it.\"    Lucy coaxed for a little while, but finding it impossible to persuade  Elsie to approach her father on the subject, finally volunteered to do  the errand herself.    Elsie readily consented, and Lucy, trembling a little in spite of her  boast that she was not afraid of him, walked out on to the veranda  where Mr. Dinsmore was still sitting, and putting on an air of great  confidence, said:    \"Mr. Dinsmore, will you please to give me Elsie's candy? she wants it.\"    \"Did Elsie send you?\" he asked in a cold, grave tone.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Lucy, somewhat frightened.    \"Then, if you please, Miss Lucy, you may tell Elsie to come directly to  me.\"    Lucy ran back to her friend, and Elsie received the message in some  trepidation, but as no choice was now left her, she went immediately to  her father.    \"Did you want me, papa?\" she asked timidly.    \"Yes, Elsie; I wish to know why you send another person to me for what  you want, instead of coming yourself. It displeases me very much, and  you may rest assured that you will never get anything that you ask for  in that way.\"    Elsie hung her head in silence.    \"Are you going to answer me?\" he asked, in his severe tone. \"Why did  you send Lucy instead of coming yourself?\"    \"I was afraid, papa,\" she whispered, almost under her breath.    \"Afraid! afraid of what?\" he asked, with increasing displeasure.    \"Of you, papa,\" she replied, in a tone so low that he could scarcely  catch the words, although he bent down his ear to receive her reply.    \"If I were a drunken brute, in the habit of knocking you about, beating  and abusing you, there might be some reason"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#15)"],[1,"ovember, 1878, p. 753]  has published an interesting account of the exploration of a mound  near Waldo, Fla., in which he found abundant evidence that cremation  had existed among the former Indian population. It is as follows:    \"In opening a burial-mound at Cade's Pond, a small body of water  situated about two miles northeastward of Santa Fe Lake, Florida, the  writer found two instances of cremation, in each of which the skull of  the subject, which was unconsumed, was used as the depository of his  ashes. The mound contained besides a large number of human burials,  the bones being much decayed. With them were deposited a great number  of vessels of pottery, many of which are painted in brilliant colors,  chiefly red, yellow, and brown, and some of them ornamented with  indented patterns, displaying not a little skill in the ceramic art,  though they are reduced to fragments. The first of the skulls referred  to was exhumed at a depth of 2 1/2 feet. It rested on its apex (base  uppermost), and was filled with fragments of half incinerated human  bones, mingled with dark-colored dust, and the sand which invariably  sifts into crania under such circumstances. Immediately beneath the  skull lay the greater part of a human tibia, presenting the peculiar  compression known as a platycnemism to the degree of affording a  latitudinal index of .512; while beneath and surrounding it lay the  fragments of a large number of human bones, probably constituting an  entire individual. In the second instance of this peculiar mode in  cremation, the cranium was discovered on nearly the opposite side of  the mound, at a depth of 2 feet, and, like the former, resting on its  apex. It was filled with a black mass--the residuum of burnt human  bones mingled with sand. At three feet to the eastward lay the shaft  of a flattened tibia, which presents the longitudinal index of .527.  Both the skulls were free from all action of fire, and though  subsequently crumbling to pieces on their removal, the writer had  opportunity to observe their strong resemblance to the small  orthocephalic crania which he had exhumed from mounds in Michigan. The  same resemblance was perceptible in the other crania belonging to this  mound. The small, narrow, retreating frontal, prominent parietal  protuberances, rather protuberant occipital, which was not in the  least compressed, the well-defined supraciliary ridges, and the  superior border of the orbits, presenting a quadrilateral outline,  were also particularly noticed. The lower facial bones, including the  maxillaries, were wanting. On consulting such works as are accessible  to him, the writer finds no mention of any similar relics having been  discovered in mounds in Florida or elsewhere. For further particulars  reference may be had to a paper on the subject read before the Saint  Louis meeting of the American Association, August, 1878.\"    The discoveries made by Mr. Gillman would seem to indicate that the  people whose bones he excavated resorted to a process of partial  cremation, some examples of which will be given on another page. The  use of crania as receptacles is certainly remarkable, if not unique.    The fact is well known to archaeologists that whenever cremation was  practiced by Indians it was customary as a rule to throw into the  blazing pyre all sorts of articles supposed to be useful to the dead,  but no instance is known of such a wholesale destruction of property  as occurred when the Indians of southern Utah burned their dead, for  Dr. E. Foreman relates, in the American Naturalist for July, 1876, the  account of the exploration of a mound in that Territory, which proved  that at the death of a person not only were the remains destroyed by  fire, but all articles of personal property, even the very habitation  which had served as a home. After the process was completed, what  remained unburned was covered with earth and a mound formed.    A. S. Tiffany [Footnote: Proc. Dav. Acad. Nat Soc., 1867-76, p. 64.]  describes what he calls a cremation-furnace, discovered within seven  miles of Davenport, Iowa:    \"... Mound seven miles below the city, a projecting point known as  Eagle Point. The surface was of the usual black soil to the depth of  from 6 to 8 inches. Next was found a burnt indurated clay, resembling  in color and texture a medium-burned brick, and about 30 inches in  depth. Immediately beneath this clay was a bed of charred human  remains 6 to 18 inches thick. This rested upon the unchanged and  undisturbed loess of the bluffs, which formed the floor of the pit.  Imbedded in this floor of unburned clay were a few very much  decomposed, but unburned, human bones. No implements of any kind were  discovered The furnace appears to have been constructed by excavating  the pit and placing at the bottom of it the bodies or skeletons which  had possibly been collected from scaffolds, and placing the fuel among  and above the bodies, with a covering of poles or split timbers  extending over and resting upon the earth, with the clay covering  above, which latter we now find resting upon the charred remains. The  ends of the timber covering, where they were protected by the earth  above and below, were reduced to charcoal, parallel pieces of which  were found at right angles to the length of the mound. No charcoal was  found among or near the remains, the combustion there having been  complete. The porous and softer portions of the bones were reduced to  pulverized bone-black. Mr. Stevens also examined the furnace. The  mound had probably not been opened after the burning.\"    This account is doubtless true, but the inferences may be incorrect.  Many more accounts of cremation among different tribes might be given  to show how prevalent was the custom, but the above are thought to be  sufficiently distinctive to serve as examples.        PARTIAL CREMATION.      Allied somewhat to cremation is a peculiar mode of burial which is  supposed to have taken place among the Cherokees or some other tribe  of North Carolina, and which is thus described by J. W Foster.  [Footnote: Pre-Historic Races, 1873, p. 149.]    \"Up to 1819 the Cherokees held possession of this region, when, in  pursuance of a treaty, they vacated a portion of the lands lying in  the valley of the Little Tennessee River. In 1821 Mr. McDowell  commenced farming. During the first season's operations the plowshare,  in passing over a certain portion of a field, produced a hollow  rumbling sound, and in exploring for the cause the first object met  with was a shallow layer of charcoal, beneath which was a slab of  burnt clay about 7 feet in length and 4 feet broad, which, in the  attempt to remove, broke into several fragments. Nothing beneath this  slab was found, but on examining its under side, to his great surprise  there was the mould of a naked human figure. Three of these burned  clay sepulchers were thus raised and examined during the first year of  his occupancy, since which time none have been found until  recently.... During the past season (1872) the plow brought up another  fragment of one of these moulds, revealing the impress of a plump  human arm.    \"Col. C. W. Jenkes, the superintendent of the Corundum mines, which  have recently been opened in that vicinity, advises me thus:    \"'We have Indians all about us, with traditions extending back for 500  years. In this time they have buried their dead under huge piles of  stones. We have at one point the remains of 600 warriors under one  pile, but a grave has just been opened of the following construction:  A pit was dug, into which the corpse was placed, face upward; then  over it was moulded a covering of mortar, fitting the form and  features. On this was built a hot fire, which formed an entire shield  of pottery for the corpse. The breaking up of one such tomb gives a  perfect cast of the form of the occupant.'    \"Colonel Jenkes, fully impressed with the value of these  archaeological discoveries, detailed a man to superintend the  exhumation, who proceeded to remove the earth from the mould, which he  reached through a layer of charcoal, and then with a trowel excavated  beneath it. The clay was not thoroughly baked, and no impression of  the corpse was left, except of the forehead and that portion of the  limbs between the ankles and the knees, and even these portions of the  mould crumbled. The body had been placed east and west, the head  toward the east. 'I had hoped,' continues Mr. McDowell, 'that the cast  in the clay would be as perfect as one I found 51 years ago, a  fragment of which I presented to Colonel Jenkes, with the impression  of a part of the arm on one side and on the other of the fingers, that  had pressed down the soft clay upon the body interred beneath.' The  mound-builders of the Ohio Valley, as has been shown, often placed a  layer of clay over the dead, but not in immediate contact, upon which  they builded fires; and the evidence that cremation was often resorted  to in their disposition are too abundant to be gainsaid.\"    This statement is corroborated by Mr. Wilcox: [Footnote: Proc. Acad.  Nat. Soc. Phila., Nov 1874, p 168.]    \"Mr. Wilcox also stated that when recently in North Carolina his  attention was called to an unusual method of burial by an ancient race  of Indians in that vicinity. In numerous instances burial places were  discovered where the bodies had been placed with the face up and  covered with a coating of plastic clay about an inch thick. A pile of  wood was then placed on top and fired, which consumed the body and  baked the clay, which retained the impression of the body. This was  then lightly covered with earth.\"    It is thought no doubt can attach to the statements given, but the  cases are remarkable as being the only instances of the kind met with  in the extensive range of reading preparatory to a study of the  subject of burial, although it must be observed that Bruhier states"]]]
