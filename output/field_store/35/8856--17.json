Cousin Sheila is coming to stay with us  on the 16th, and she's actually bringing her friend Mildred Lancaster,  the famous violinist! You know they both went to St. Cyprian's and were  in the same form with Miss Mitchell. She'll be so pleased to meet them  again! Cousin Sheila says Miss Lancaster promises to play at your school  concert. Isn't that an honour? It will be something for you to tell Miss  Mitchell, won't it? We'll ask her and Miss Fanny and some of the girls to  tea while our visitors are here!\"    This was indeed a delightful surprise. The name of Mildred Lancaster was  one to conjure with in musical circles. She had just completed a most  successful tour in Australia and America, and had won great applause. She  was booked to give a recital in Exeter on the 15th, so that she would be  in the neighbourhood and able easily to come on to Durracombe. She made  her headquarters at Kirkton, so Mrs. Ramsay explained, but travelled much  about the country playing at concerts. She was to be married in the  spring to her old friend, Rodney Somerville, to whom she had been engaged  for some years, but she did not intend to give up her music, and hoped  still to make frequent public appearances.    \"They're to have a flat in town,\" read Mother from Cousin Sheila's  letter. \"I'm so glad it's settled that way, because I want Mildred to be  happy, yet it would be a wicked shame if she flung her talent to the  winds, as some girls do when they marry. She'll have her own little home  and yet go on with her career. I call it ideal!\"    Mavis and Merle danced off to school simply brimming over with their  news. It certainly had the desired effect. Miss Mitchell was very much  thrilled at the prospect of meeting her old friends, and highly  appreciated the privilege of a violin solo at the concert. The girls  were, of course, most excited, except the performers, who nearly had  hysterics at the prospect of playing before so great a musical star.    \"I shall leave my violin at home!\" wailed Beata.    \"Nonsense! You'll find nobody more kind and encouraging than Miss  Lancaster,\" said Miss Mitchell. \"It isn't the great artists who find  fault--they understand the difficulties only too well--it's the carping  critics who can't perform themselves and yet think they know all about  it! Do your best and no one will expect you to do any more!\"    It was a great day for Mavis and Merle when their visitors arrived. They  were fond of Cousin Sheila and welcomed her on her own account. With her  companion they readily fell in love. Mildred Lancaster was a most  charming personality, and although she had been so fêted on concert  platforms, she was absolutely simple and unaffected in private life. She  had brought her wonderful Stradivarius violin, upon which she always  played, and she took it out of its case and allowed the girls to admire  its graceful curves, and its fine old varnish.    \"It's my mascot!\" she said. \"I've had it all my life, and if anything  were to happen to it I believe I'd give up music! It's been a great  traveller, and always stays in my berth on sea voyages.\"    To say that the Ramsays were proud to escort Miss Lancaster and her  Stradivarius to 'The Moorings' hardly describes their elation. A few  parents and friends had been asked, so that with the school there was  quite a large audience. It was arranged to take the girls' part of the  programme first, and the visitors' solos afterwards, a proceeding for  which the young performers were devoutly thankful. They got through their  pieces very creditably, especially Beata, who won warm praise from Miss  Lancaster.    \"That child's artistic and will make a musician if she goes on with it.  She puts _herself_ into her playing.\"    \"They're rather a remarkable family. Her sister is studying singing in  London,\" purred Miss Pollard, pleased to have one of her pupils thus  noticed.    The treat of the afternoon was when Mildred Lancaster began to play, and  her entire mastery of her instrument was a revelation to most of the  girls. They had never before had the opportunity of listening to such  glorious music.    \"The gramophone will sound like a ghost after this, however good the  records!\" declared Iva. \"I wish I could hear her again.\"    \"Miss Fanny's bringing fourteen of you to tea to-morrow--hasn't she told  you yet?\" exulted Merle.    Muriel had also been included in the invitation in spite of her previous  discourtesy.    \"It hurt _you_ to be left out, so don't inflict the same feeling on  anybody else!\" urged Mrs. Ramsay when her younger daughter demurred. \"Two  blacks never make a white! The best way of 'getting even' with people is  to do them a kindness. That stops the whole thing and sets it into a  different groove. Ask Muriel if her aunt will come too. She sings  beautifully, and perhaps she will bring her music.\"    The Ramsays' 'Musical At Home' was remembered for a long time by those  girls who were present at it. Mother was a clever hostess, and she  managed to put all her guests at ease and raise that magic atmosphere of  enjoyment which only certain people seem able to create. The drawing-room  looked charming with late flowers in its vases and a blazing log fire.  Miss Mitchell, having snatched a private chat with her two old school  friends, was radiant. Jessop, who had heard full details of the occasion,  had insisted on coming over to bake the cakes, and hovered in the  background like a beneficent deity, sending in fresh batches of hot  crumpets. There were chocolates in little silver bonbonnières and even  crackers, though it was not yet Christmas. Aunt Nellie was there and  enjoyed the music, and Dr. Tremayne and Dr. Ramsay joined them before the  performance was over.    \"Wasn't it a triumph? I think we know how to give a party!\" rejoiced  Merle in private afterwards.    \"Yes, when Mother pulls the strings!\" agreed Mavis.          CHAPTER VIII    Yule-tide      The end of the term was, to use Merle's expression, 'a little thin.' Miss  Mitchell did not seem disposed to make any very great fuss about it, and  merely set aside the last hour of the last afternoon for the play which  the boarders had prepared. She suggested, indeed, that the day-girls  might get up some tableaux, but as no one evinced any enthusiasm the  matter dropped.    \"Tableaux are rather tame unless you have most beautiful dresses,\"  sniffed Muriel.    \"It really isn't worth our while bothering over them,\" agreed Merle.    They were decidedly disappointed to have no chance to exhibit their own  dramatic talents, but they were 'sporting' enough to give a hearty clap  to the boarders' performance, a really magnanimous attitude on the part  of Mavis, who had lent a pale pink silk dress to Nesta, and watched  candle grease dropping down the front of it as that heroine pretended to  investigate a smuggler's cellar with a light.    \"Never mind! We'll have some acting of our own in the hols,\" she  whispered to Merle, who sat next to her.    \"Rather! And it will beat this simply into fits, though of course I  shan't tell them so.\"    The holidays this Christmas were to compensate for every disagreeable  thing that had happened in the course of the term. First and foremost,  and this ought to be written in big letters like a poster heading, BEVIS  WAS COMING TO STAY. Mrs. Ramsay had invited him for a three weeks' visit  to Bridge House, and he was to arrive on December 23rd. He had always  been a great favourite with Dr. Tremayne, who thought that the boy's  position was rather a lonely one, and that on this first Christmas in  particular, after the solution of the mystery of his birth, he would feel  the lack of any family of his own and would be glad to be welcomed by  friends.    Naturally, to Mavis and Merle this was the event of greatest importance,  but there was to be another pleasant happening as well. Cousin Clive was  also coming to spend the holidays. He was Dr. Tremayne's grandson and his  home was in London. The girls had never seen him, as he had not paid a  visit to Durracombe during the last year, and they were very curious to  know what he was like. Any misgivings which they may have cherished  vanished instantly, however, at the first sight of Clive. He was a very  big boy of twelve, as tall as Merle, with merry grey eyes that looked  capable of fun. He was, of course, full of the affairs of his own  preparatory school, but as he found they were ready to listen to his  accounts of football matches or dormitory 'rags' he took them into his  masculine confidence and extended the hand of friendship. He showed a  particular fancy for Merle, whose robuster constitution allowed her to  tear about with him and indulge in some rather hoydenish performances.    \"You're a thorough tomboy!\" said Mother, having called her younger  daughter down from the coach-house roof, whither she had climbed in  company with her cousin.    \"Well, you see, Mummie dear, I have to amuse Clive!\" was always Merle's  excuse. \"If I didn't keep him quiet he'd kick up no end of a racket and  disturb Aunt Nellie. It's really very kind of me!\"    \"There's a large spice of enjoyment mixed with the philanthropy!\"  twinkled Mother.    \"Well, that's the right spirit. We ought to enjoy our own good deeds!\"  laughed Merle.    As Aunt Nellie was really a consideration in regard to noise, the young  people had taken over the harness room as a temporary boudoir during the  holidays. They carried down some basket chairs, tacked a few coloured  pictures from annuals on its bare walls, and made it look quite pretty.  Tom lighted them a blazing fire every day, and tended it during their  absence with the care of a vestal virgin, so they were extremely cosy and  jolly there. The joiner's bench and the glue-pot gave facilities for any  hobbies they wished to carry on; they could make as much noise as they  liked, and walk in and out with dirty boots,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#15)"],[1," England under Cromwell opened its portals to the Jews.  In Italy, in the dank atmosphere of rabbinical dialectics and morbid  mysticism, great figures loom up--Leon de Modena, the antagonist of  Rabbinism and of the Kabbala, and Joseph del Medigo, mathematician,  philosopher, and mystic, the disciple of Galileo.    These purple patches were nothing more than the accidents of a  transition period. The people as a whole was on the decline. The  Jewish mind darted hither and thither, like a startled bird seeking  its nest. Holland or Turkey was an inadequate substitute for Spain, if  only for the reason that but a tiny fraction of the Jews had found  shelter in either. The Jewish national centre must perforce coincide  with the numerical centre of the dispersed people, in which, moreover,  conditions must grant Jews the possibility of living undisturbed in  closely compacted masses, and of perfecting a well-knit organization  of social and individual life. Outside of Spain these conditions were  fulfilled only by Poland, which gradually, beginning with the  sixteenth century, assumed the hegemony over the Jewry of the world.  This marks the displacement of the Sephardic (Spanish, in a broader  sense, Romanic) element, and the supremacy of the Ashkenazic  (German-Polish) element.    Poland had been a resort for Jewish immigrants from Germany since the  outbreak of the Crusades, until, in the sixteenth century, it rose to  the position of a Jewish centre of the first magnitude. As the  merchant middle class, the Jews were protected and advanced by the  kings and the Szlachta. The consequent security of their position  induced so rapid a growth of the Jewish element that in a little while  the Jews of Poland outnumbered those of the old Jewish settlements in  Occidental Europe. The numerous privileges granted the Jews, by  Boleslaus of Kalish (1246), Kasimir the Great (1347-1370), Witowt  (1388), Kasimir IV (1447), and some of their successors, fortified  their position in the extended territory covered by Poland, Lithuania,  and the Ukraine. Their peculiar circumstances in Poland left an  impress upon their inner life. An intense mental activity was called  forth. This activity can be traced back to German beginnings, though  at the same time it is made up of many original elements. For a space  Rabbinism monopolized the intellectual endeavors of the Polish Jews.  The rabbi of Cracow, Moses Isserles, and the rabbi of Ostrog, Solomon  Luria (d. 1572), disputed first place with the foremost rabbinical  authorities of other countries. Their decisions and circular letters  regarding religious and legal questions were accorded binding force.  Associates and successors of theirs founded Talmud academies  throughout the country, and large numbers of students attended them.  Commentators upon the Talmud and expounders of classical works in  Jewish theological literature appeared in shoals. Jewish printing  establishments in Cracow and Lublin were assiduous in turning out a  mass of writings, which spread the fame of the Polish rabbis to the  remotest communities. The large autonomy enjoyed by the Polish and  Lithuanian Jews conferred executive power upon rabbinical legislation.  The _Kahal_, or Jewish communal government, to a certain degree  invested with judicial and administrative competence, could not do  without the guiding hand of the rabbis as interpreters of the law. The  guild of rabbis, on their side, chose a \"college of judges,\" with  fairly extensive jurisdiction, from among their own members. The  organization of the Rabbinical Conferences, or the \"Synods of the Four  Countries,\" formed the keystone of this intricate social-spiritual  hierarchy. The comprehensive inner autonomy and the system of Talmud  academies (_Yeshiboth_) that covered the whole of Poland remind  one of the brilliant days of the Exilarchate and the Babylonia of the  Geonim. One element was lacking, there was no versatile, commanding  thinker like Saadia Gaon. Secular knowledge and philosophy were under  the ban in Poland. Rabbinism absorbed the whole output of intellectual  energy. As little as the Poles resembled the Arabs of the \"golden  age,\" did the Polish Jews resemble their brethren in faith in the  Orient at Saadia's time or in the Spain of Gabirol and Maimonides.  Isolation and clannishness were inevitable in view of the character of  the Christian environment and the almost insuperable barriers raised  between the classes of Polish society. But it was this exclusiveness  that gave peculiar stability and completeness to the life of the Jew  as an individual and as a member of Jewish society, and it was the  same exclusiveness that afforded opportunity for the development of a  sharply defined culture, for its fixation to the point of resisting  violent shocks and beyond the danger point of extinction through  foreign invasion.    The fateful year 1648 formed a turning point in the history of the  Polish Jews, as in the history of the countries belonging to the  Polish crown. The Cossack butcheries and wars of extermination of  1648-1658 were the same for the Polish Jews that the Crusades, the  Black Death, and all the other occasions for carnage had been for the  Jews of Western Europe. It seemed as though history desired to avoid  the reproach of partiality, and hastened to mete out even-handed  justice by apportioning the same measure of woe to the Jews of Poland  as to the Jews of Western Europe. But the Polish Jews were prepared to  accept the questionable gift from the hands of history. They had  mounted that eminence of spiritual stability on which suffering loses  the power to weaken its victim, but, on the contrary, endues him with  strength. More than ever they shrank into their shell. They shut  themselves up more completely in their inner world, and became morally  dulled against the persecutions, the bitter humiliations, the deep  scorn, which their surroundings visited upon them. The Polish Jew  gradually accustomed himself to his pitiable condition. He hardly knew  that life might be other than it was. That the Polish lord to whom he  was a means of entertainment might treat him with a trace of respect,  or that his neighbors, the middle class merchant, the German guild  member, and the Little Russian peasant, might cherish kindly feelings  toward him, he could not conceive as a possibility. Seeing himself  surrounded by enemies, he took precautions to fortify his camp, not so  much to protect himself against hostile assaults from without--they  were inevitable--as to paralyze the disastrous consequences of such  assaults in his inner world. To compass this end he brought into play  all the means suggested by his exceptional position before the law and  by his own peculiar social constitution. The _Kahal_, the  autonomous rabbinical administration of communal affairs, more and  more assumed the character of an inner dictatorship. Jewish society  was persistently kept under the discipline of rigid principles. In  many affairs the synagogue attained the position of a court of final  appeal. The people were united, or rather packed, into a solid mass by  purely mechanical processes--by pressure from without, and by drawing  tight a noose from within. Besides this social factor tending to  consolidate the Jewish people into a separate union, an intellectual  lever was applied to produce the same result. Rabbinism employed the  mystical as its adjutant. The one exercised control over all minds,  the other over all hearts. The growth of mysticism was fostered both  by the unfortunate conditions under which the Polish Jews endured  existence and by the Messianic movements which made their appearance  among the Jews of other countries.    In the second half of the seventeenth century, mysticism reached its  zenith in Turkey, the country in which, had stood the cradle of the  \"practical Kabbala.\" The teachings of Ari, Vital, and the school  established by them spread like wildfire. Messianic extravagances  intoxicated the baited and persecuted people. In Smyrna appeared the  false Messiah, Sabbatai Zebi. As by magic he attracted to himself a  tremendous company of adherents in the East and in the West. For a  quarter of a century (1650-1676), he kept the Jewish communities  everywhere in a state of quivering suspense.    The harassed people tossed to and fro like a fever patient, and raved  about political re-birth. Its delirious visions still further heated  its agitated blood. It came to its senses but slowly. Not even the  apostasy and death of Sabbatai Zebi sufficed to sober all his  followers. Under the guise of a symbolic faith in a Messiah, many of  them, publicly or secretly, continued the propaganda for his  doctrines.    This propaganda prepared the fertile soil from which, in the  eighteenth century, shot up Messianic systems, tending to split  Judaism into sects. Nowhere did the mystical teachings evoke so ready  a response as in Poland, the very centre of Judaism. At first an ally  of the rabbinical school, mysticism grown passionate and  uncontrollable now and again acted as the violent opponent of  Rabbinism. Secret devotion to the Sabbatian doctrines, which had made  their home in Poland, sometimes led to such extremes in dogma and  ethics that the rabbis could not contain themselves. Chayyim Malach,  Judah Chassid, and other Galician mystics, in the second decade of the  eighteenth century brought down upon themselves a rabbinical decree of  excommunication. The mystical tendency was the precursor of the  heretical half-Christian sect of Frankists, who ventured so far as to  lift a hand against the fundamentals of Judaism: they rejected the  Talmud in favor of the Zohar (1756-1773). At the same time a much more  profound movement, instinct with greater vitality, made its appearance  among the Polish-Jewish masses, a movement rooted in their social and  spiritual organization. The wretched, debased condition "]]]
