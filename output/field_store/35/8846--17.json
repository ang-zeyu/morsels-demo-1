[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#15)"],[1,"ted. He was  jogging on steadily to his century.    Bob Jackson went in next, with instructions to keep his eye on the  lob-man.    For a time things went well. Saunders, who had gone on to bowl again  after a rest, seemed to give Morris no trouble, and Bob put him  through the slips with apparent ease. Twenty runs were added, when the  lob-bowler once more got in his deadly work. Bob, letting alone a ball  wide of the off-stump under the impression that it was going to break  away, was disagreeably surprised to find it break in instead, and hit  the wicket. The bowler smiled sadly, as if he hated to have to do  these things.    Mike's heart jumped as he saw the bails go. It was his turn next.    \"Two hundred and twenty-nine,\" said Burgess, \"and it's ten past six.  No good trying for the runs now. Stick in,\" he added to Mike. \"That's  all you've got to do.\"    All!... Mike felt as if he was being strangled. His heart was racing  like the engines of a motor. He knew his teeth were chattering. He  wished he could stop them. What a time Bob was taking to get back to  the pavilion! He wanted to rush out, and get the thing over.    At last he arrived, and Mike, fumbling at a glove, tottered out into  the sunshine. He heard miles and miles away a sound of clapping, and a  thin, shrill noise as if somebody were screaming in the distance. As a  matter of fact, several members of his form and of the junior day-room  at Wain's nearly burst themselves at that moment.    At the wickets, he felt better. Bob had fallen to the last ball of the  over, and Morris, standing ready for Saunders's delivery, looked so  calm and certain of himself that it was impossible to feel entirely  without hope and self-confidence. Mike knew that Morris had made  ninety-eight, and he supposed that Morris knew that he was very near  his century; yet he seemed to be absolutely undisturbed. Mike drew  courage from his attitude.    Morris pushed the first ball away to leg. Mike would have liked to  have run two, but short leg had retrieved the ball as he reached the  crease.    The moment had come, the moment which he had experienced only in  dreams. And in the dreams he was always full of confidence, and  invariably hit a boundary. Sometimes a drive, sometimes a cut, but  always a boundary.    \"To leg, sir,\" said the umpire.    \"Don't be in a funk,\" said a voice. \"Play straight, and you can't get  out.\"    It was Joe, who had taken the gloves when the wicket-keeper went on to  bowl.    Mike grinned, wryly but gratefully.    Saunders was beginning his run. It was all so home-like that for a  moment Mike felt himself again. How often he had seen those two little  skips and the jump. It was like being in the paddock again, with  Marjory and the dogs waiting by the railings to fetch the ball if he  made a drive.    Saunders ran to the crease, and bowled.    Now, Saunders was a conscientious man, and, doubtless, bowled the very  best ball that he possibly could. On the other hand, it was Mike's  first appearance for the school, and Saunders, besides being  conscientious, was undoubtedly kind-hearted. It is useless to  speculate as to whether he was trying to bowl his best that ball. If  so, he failed signally. It was a half-volley, just the right distance  away from the off-stump; the sort of ball Mike was wont to send nearly  through the net at home....    The next moment the dreams had come true. The umpire was signalling to  the scoring-box, the school was shouting, extra-cover was trotting to  the boundary to fetch the ball, and Mike was blushing and wondering  whether it was bad form to grin.    From that ball onwards all was for the best in this best of all  possible worlds. Saunders bowled no more half-volleys; but Mike  played everything that he did bowl. He met the lobs with a bat like  a barn-door. Even the departure of Morris, caught in the slips off  Saunders's next over for a chanceless hundred and five, did not disturb  him. All nervousness had left him. He felt equal to the situation.  Burgess came in, and began to hit out as if he meant to knock off the  runs. The bowling became a shade loose. Twice he was given full tosses  to leg, which he hit to the terrace bank. Half-past six chimed, and two  hundred and fifty went up on the telegraph board. Burgess continued to  hit. Mike's whole soul was concentrated on keeping up his wicket.  There was only Reeves to follow him, and Reeves was a victim to the  first straight ball. Burgess had to hit because it was the only game  he knew; but he himself must simply stay in.    The hands of the clock seemed to have stopped. Then suddenly he heard  the umpire say \"Last over,\" and he settled down to keep those six  balls out of his wicket.    The lob bowler had taken himself off, and the Oxford Authentic had  gone on, fast left-hand.    The first ball was short and wide of the off-stump. Mike let it alone.  Number two: yorker. Got him! Three: straight half-volley. Mike played  it back to the bowler. Four: beat him, and missed the wicket by an  inch. Five: another yorker. Down on it again in the old familiar way.    All was well. The match was a draw now whatever happened to him. He  hit out, almost at a venture, at the last ball, and mid-off, jumping,  just failed to reach it. It hummed over his head, and ran like a  streak along the turf and up the bank, and a great howl of delight  went up from the school as the umpire took off the bails.    Mike walked away from the wickets with Joe and the wicket-keeper.    \"I'm sorry about your nose, Joe,\" said the wicket-keeper in tones of  grave solicitude.    \"What's wrong with it?\"    \"At present,\" said the wicket-keeper, \"nothing. But in a few years I'm  afraid it's going to be put badly out of joint.\"          CHAPTER XIV    A SLIGHT IMBROGLIO      Mike got his third eleven colours after the M.C.C. match. As he had  made twenty-three not out in a crisis in a first eleven match, this  may not seem an excessive reward. But it was all that he expected. One  had to take the rungs of the ladder singly at Wrykyn. First one was  given one's third eleven cap. That meant, \"You are a promising man,  and we have our eye on you.\" Then came the second colours. They might  mean anything from \"Well, here you are. You won't get any higher, so  you may as well have the thing now,\" to \"This is just to show that we  still have our eye on you.\"    Mike was a certainty now for the second. But it needed more than one  performance to secure the first cap.    \"I told you so,\" said Wyatt, naturally, to Burgess after the match.    \"He's not bad,\" said Burgess. \"I'll give him another shot.\"    But Burgess, as has been pointed out, was not a person who ever became  gushing with enthusiasm.           *       *       *       *       *    So Wilkins, of the School House, who had played twice for the first  eleven, dropped down into the second, as many a good man had done  before him, and Mike got his place in the next match, against the  Gentlemen of the County. Unfortunately for him, the visiting team,  however gentlemanly, were not brilliant cricketers, at any rate as far  as bowling was concerned. The school won the toss, went in first, and  made three hundred and sixteen for five wickets, Morris making another  placid century. The innings was declared closed before Mike had a  chance of distinguishing himself. In an innings which lasted for  one over he made two runs, not out; and had to console himself for  the cutting short of his performance by the fact that his average  for the school was still infinity. Bob, who was one of those lucky  enough to have an unabridged innings, did better in this match, making  twenty-five. But with Morris making a hundred and seventeen, and  Berridge, Ellerby, and Marsh all passing the half-century, this score  did not show up excessively.    We now come to what was practically a turning-point in Mike's career  at Wrykyn. There is no doubt that his meteor-like flights at cricket  had an unsettling effect on him. He was enjoying life amazingly, and,  as is not uncommon with the prosperous, he waxed fat and kicked.  Fortunately for him--though he did not look upon it in that light at  the time--he kicked the one person it was most imprudent to kick. The  person he selected was Firby-Smith. With anybody else the thing might  have blown over, to the detriment of Mike's character; but Firby-Smith,  having the most tender affection for his dignity, made a fuss.    It happened in this way. The immediate cause of the disturbance was a  remark of Mike's, but the indirect cause was the unbearably  patronising manner which the head of Wain's chose to adopt towards  him. The fact that he was playing for the school seemed to make no  difference at all. Firby-Smith continued to address Mike merely as the  small boy.    The following, _verbatim_, was the tactful speech which he  addressed to him on the evening of the M.C.C. match, having summoned  him to his study for the purpose.    \"Well,\" he said, \"you played a very decent innings this afternoon, and  I suppose you're frightfully pleased with yourself, eh? Well, mind you  don't go getting swelled head. See? That's all. Run along.\"    Mike departed, bursting with fury.    The next link in the chain was forged a week after the Gentlemen of  the County match. House matches had begun, and Wain's were playing  Appleby's. Appleby's made a hundred and fifty odd, shaping badly for  the most part against Wyatt's slows. Then Wain's opened their innings.  The Gazeka, as head of the house, was captain of the side, and he and  Wyatt went in first. Wyatt made a few mighty hits, and was then caught  at cover. Mike went in first wicket.    For some ten minutes all was peace. Firby-Smith scratched away at his  end, getting here and there a single and now and then a two, and Mike  settled down at once to play what he felt was going to be the innings  of a lifetime. Appleby's bowling was on the feeble side, with Raikes,  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#15)"],[1,"of bears, and rolled off his perch; so there he hung,  kicking and wailing, half awake, and so scared it was long before Tommy  could make him believe that he was quite safe.    How to get him down was the next question. The branch was not strong  enough to bear Tommy, though he climbed up and tried to unhook poor  Billy. The belt was firmly twisted at the back, and Billy could not  reach to undo it, nor could he get his legs round the branch to pull  himself up. There seemed no way but to unbuckle the belt and drop. That  he was afraid to try; for the ground was hard, and the fall a high one.  Fortunately both belt and buckle were strong; so he hung safely, though  very uncomfortably, while Tommy racked his boyish brain to find a way to  help him.    Billy had just declared that he should be cut in two very soon if  something was not done for him, and Tommy was in despair, when they  thought they heard a far-off shout, and both answered it till their  throats were nearly split with screaming.    \"I seem to see a light moving round down that way,\" cried Billy from his  hook, pointing toward the valley.    \"They are looking for us, but they won't hear us. I'll run and holler  louder, and bring 'em up here,\" answered Tommy, glad to do anything that  would put an end to this dreadful state of things.    \"Don't leave me! I may fall and be killed! The bear might come! Don't  go! don't go!\" wailed Billy, longing to drop, but afraid.    \"I won't go far, and I'll come back as quick as I can. You are safe up  there. Hold on, and we'll soon get you down,\" answered Tommy, rushing  away helter-skelter, never minding where he went, and too much excited  to care for any damage.    The moon was bright on the blasted trees; but when he came down among  the green pines, it grew dark, and he often stumbled and fell. Never  minding bumps and bruises, he scrambled over rocks, leaped fallen  trunks, floundered through brooks, and climbed down steep places, till,  with a reckless jump, he went heels over head into a deep hole, and lay  there for a moment stunned by the fall. It was an old bear-trap, long  unused, and fortunately well carpeted with dead leaves, or poor Tommy  would have broken his bones.    When he came to himself he was so used up that he lay still for some  time in a sort of daze, too tired to know or care about anything, only  dimly conscious that somebody was lost in a tree or a well, and that, on  the whole, running away was not all fun.    By and by the sound of a gun roused him; and remembering poor Billy, he  tried to get out of the pit,--for the moon showed him where he was. But  it was too deep, and he was too stiff with weariness and the fall to be  very nimble. So he shouted, and whistled, and raged about very like a  little bear caught in the pit.    It is very difficult to find a lost person on these great mountains, and  many wander for hours not far from help, bewildered by the thick woods,  the deep ravines, and precipices which shut them in. Some have lost  their lives; and as Tommy lay on the leaves used up by his various  struggles, he thought of all the stories he had lately heard at the  farm, and began to wonder how it would feel to starve to death down  there, and to wish poor Billy could come to share his prison, that they  might die together, like the Babes in the Wood, or better still the Boy  Scouts lost on the prairies in that thrilling story, \"Bill Boomerang,  the Wild Hunter of the West.\"    \"I guess mother is worried this time, because I never stayed out all  night before, and I never will again without leave. It's rather good  fun, though, if they only find me. I ain't afraid, and it isn't very  cold. I always wanted to sleep out, and now I'm doing it. Wish poor  Billy was safely down and in this good bed with me. Won't he be scared  all alone there? Maybe the belt will break and he get hurt bumping down.  Sorry now I left him, he's such a 'fraid-cat. There's the gun again!  Guess it's that man after us. Hi! hollo! Here I am! Whoop! Hurrah! Hi!  hi! hi!\"    Tommy's meditations ended in a series of yells as loud as his shrill  little voice could make them, and he thought some one answered. But it  must have been an echo, for no one came; and after another rampage round  his prison, the poor boy nestled down among the leaves, and went fast  asleep because there was nothing else to do.    So there they were, the two young hunters, lost at midnight on the  mountain,--one hanging like an apple on the old tree, and the other  sound asleep in a bear-pit. Their distracted mothers meantime were  weeping and wringing their hands at the farm, while all the men in  the neighborhood were out looking for the lost boys. The hunter on his  return to the hotel had reported meeting the runaways and his effort to  send them home in good season; so people knew where to look, and, led by  the man and dog, up the mountain went Mr. Mullin with his troop. It was  a mild night, and the moon shone high and clear; so the hunt was, on the  whole, rather easy and pleasant at first, and lanterns flashed through  the dark forest like fireflies, the lonely cliffs seemed alive with men,  and voices echoed in places where usually only the brooks babbled  and the hawks screamed. But as time went on, and no sign of the boys  appeared, the men grew anxious, and began to fear some serious harm had  come to the runaways.    \"I can't go home without them little shavers no way, 'specially Tommy,\"  said Mr. Mullin, as they stopped to rest after a hard climb through the  blasted grove. \"He's a boy after my own heart, spry as a chipmunk,  smart as a young cockerel, and as full of mischief as a monkey. He ain't  afraid of anything, and I shouldn't be a mite surprised to find him  enjoyin' himself first-rate, and as cool as a coocumber.\"    \"The fat boy won't take it so easily, I fancy. If it hadn't been for  him I'd have kept the lively fellow with me, and shown him how to hunt.  Sorry now I didn't take them both home,\" said the man with the gun,  seeing his mistake too late, as people often do.    \"Maybe they've fell down a precipice and got killed, like Moses Warner,  when he was lost,\" suggested a tall fellow, who had shouted himself  hoarse.    \"Hush up, and come on! The dog is barkin' yonder, and he may have found  'em,\" said the farmer, hurrying toward the place where the hound was  baying at something in a tree.    It was poor Billy, hanging there still, half unconscious with weariness  and fear. The belt had slipped up under his arms, so he could breathe  easily; and there he was, looking like a queer sort of cone on the  blasted pine.    \"Wal, I never!\" exclaimed the farmer, as the tall lad climbed up, and,  unhooking Billy, handed him down like a young bird, into the arms held  up to catch him.    \"He's all right, only scared out of his wits. Come along and look for  the other one. I'll warrant he went for help, and may be half-way home  by this time,\" said the hunter, who didn't take much interest in the fat  boy.    Tommy's hat lay on the ground; and showing it to the dog, his master  told him to find the boy. The good hound sniffed about, and then set off  with his nose to the ground, following the zigzag track Tommy had taken  in his hurry. The hunter and several of the men went after him, leaving  the farmer with the others to take care of Billy.    Presently the dog came to the bear-pit, and began to bark again.    \"He's got him!\" cried the men, much relieved; and rushing on soon saw  the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of  the dark hole.    It was Tommy's face in the moonlight, for the rest of him was covered up  with leaves. The little round face seemed very quiet; and for a moment  the men stood quite still, fearing that the fall might have done the  boy some harm. Then the hunter leaped down, and gently touched the brown  cheek. It was warm, and a soft snore from the pug nose made the man call  out, much relieved,--    \"He's all right. Wake up here, little chap; you are wanted at home. Had  hunting enough for this time?\"    As he spoke, Tommy opened his eyes, gave a stretch, and said, \"Hollo,  Billy,\" as calmly as if in his own bed at home. Then the rustle of the  leaves, the moonlight in his face, and the sight of several men staring  down at him startled him wide awake.    \"Did you shoot the big bear?\" he asked, looking up at the hunter with a  grin.    \"No; but I caught a little one, and here he is,\" answered the man,  giving Tommy a roll in the leaves, much pleased because he did not whine  or make a fuss.    \"Got lost, didn't we? Oh, I say, where's Billy? I left him up a tree  like a coon, and he wouldn't come down,\" laughed Tommy, kicking off his  brown bed-clothes, and quite ready to get up now.    They all laughed with him; and presently, when the story was told, they  pulled the boy out of the pit, and went back to join the other wanderer,  who was now sitting up eating the bread and butter Mrs. Mullin sent for  their very late supper.    The men roared again, as the two boys told their various tribulations;  and when they had been refreshed, the party started for home, blowing  the tin horns, and firing shot after shot to let the scattered searchers  know that the lost children were found. Billy was very quiet, and gladly  rode on the various broad backs offered for his use, but Tommy stoutly  refused to be carried, and with an occasional \"boost\" over a very rough  place, walked all the way down on his own sturdy legs. He was the hero  of the adventure, and was never tired of relating how he caught the  woodchuck, cooked the fish, slid down the big rock, and went to bed in  the old bear-pit. But in his own little mind he resolved to wait till he  was older before he tried to be a hunter; and though he caught several  wood-chucks that summer, he never shot another harmless little bird.
