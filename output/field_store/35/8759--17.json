He had married her in  his beloved Perugia, and she meant all the joy of life to him. He was  so proud of her beauty that he would buy her the richest dresses and  most costly jewels, and with his own hands would deck her with them.  Her brown eyes were like the depths of some quiet pool, her fair face  and the wonderful soul that shone there were to him the most perfect  picture in the world.    'I will paint thee once, that the world may be the richer,' said  Perugino, 'but only once, for thy beauty is too rare for common use.  And I will paint thee not as an earthly beauty, but thou shalt be the  angel in the story of Tobias which thou knowest.'    So he painted her as he said. And in our own National Gallery we still  have the picture, and we may see her there as the beautiful angel who  leads the little boy Tobias by the hand.    Up to the very last years of his life, Perugino painted as diligently  as he had ever done, but the peaceful days of Perugia had long since  given place to war and tumult, both within and without the city. Then  too a terrible plague swept over the countryside, and people died by  thousands.    To the hospital of Fartignano, close to Perugia, they carried Perugino  when the deadly plague seized him, and there he died. There was no time  to think of grand funerals; the people were buried as quickly as  possible, in whatever place lay closest at hand.    So it came to pass that Perugino was laid to rest in an open field  under an oak-tree close by. Later on his sons wished to have him buried  in holy ground, and some say that this was done, but nothing is known  for certain. Perhaps if he could have chosen, he would have been glad  to think that his body should rest under the shelter of the trees he  loved to paint, in that waste openness of space which had always been  his vision of beauty, since, as a little boy, he gazed across the  Umbrian Plain, and the wonder of it sank into his soul.        LEONARDO DA VINCI    On the sunny slopes of Monte Albano, between Florence and Pisa, the  little town of Vinci lay high among the rocks that crowned the steep  hillside. It was but a little town. Only a few houses crowded together  round an old castle in the midst, and it looked from a distance like a  swallow's nest clinging to the bare steep rocks.    Here in the year 1452 Leonardo, son of Ser Piero da Vinci, was born. It  was in the age when people told fortunes by the stars, and when a baby  was born they would eagerly look up and decide whether it was a lucky  or unlucky star which shone upon the child. Surely if it had been  possible in this way to tell what fortune awaited the little Leonardo,  a strange new star must have shone that night, brighter than the others  and unlike the rest in the dazzling light of its strength and beauty.    Leonardo was always a strange child. Even his beauty was not like that  of other children. He had the most wonderful waving hair, falling in  regular ripples, like the waters of a fountain, the colour of bright  gold, and soft as spun silk. His eyes were blue and clear, with a  mysterious light in them, not the warm light of a sunny sky, but rather  the blue that glints in the iceberg. They were merry eyes too, when he  laughed, but underneath was always that strange cold look. There was a  charm about his smile which no one could resist, and he was a favourite  with all. Yet people shook their heads sometimes as they looked at him,  and they talked in whispers of the old witch who had lent her goat to  nourish the little Leonardo when he was a baby. The woman was a dealer  in black magic, and who knew but that the child might be a changeling?    It was the old grandmother, Mona Lena, who brought Leonardo up and  spoilt him not a little. His father, Ser Piero, was a lawyer, and spent  most of his time in Florence, but when he returned to the old castle of  Vinci, he began to give Leonardo lessons and tried to find out what the  boy was fit for. But Leonardo hated those lessons and would not learn,  so when he was seven years old he was sent to school.    This did not answer any better. The rough play of the boys was not to  his liking. When he saw them drag the wings off butterflies, or torture  any animal that fell into their hands, his face grew white with pain,  and he would take no share in their games. The Latin grammar, too, was  a terrible task, while the many things he longed to know no one taught  him.    So it happened that many a time, instead of going to school, he would  slip away and escape up into the hills, as happy as a little wild goat.  Here was all the sweet fresh air of heaven, instead of the stuffy  schoolroom. Here were no cruel, clumsy boys, but all the wild creatures  that he loved. Here he could learn the real things his heart was hungry  to know, not merely words which meant nothing and led to nowhere.    For hours he would lie perfectly still with his heels in the air and  his chin resting in his hands, as he watched a spider weaving its web,  breathless with interest to see how the delicate threads were turned in  and out. The gaily painted butterflies, the fat buzzing bees, the  little sharp-tongued green lizards, he loved to watch them all, but  above everything he loved the birds. Oh, if only he too had wings to  dart like the swallows, and swoop and sail and dart again! What was the  secret power in their wings? Surely by watching he might learn it.  Sometimes it seemed as if his heart would burst with the longing to  learn that secret. It was always the hidden reason of things that he  desired to know. Much as he loved the flowers he must pull their petals  of, one by one, to see how each was joined, to wonder at the dusty  pollen, and touch the honey-covered stamens. Then when the sun began to  sink he would turn sadly homewards, very hungry, with torn clothes and  tired feet, but with a store of sunshine in his heart.    His grandmother shook her head when Leonardo appeared after one of his  days of wandering.    'I know thou shouldst be whipped for playing truant,' she said; 'and I  should also punish thee for tearing thy clothes.'    'Ah! but thou wilt not whip me,' answered Leonardo, smiling at her with  his curious quiet smile, for he had full confidence in her love.    'Well, I love to see thee happy, and I will not punish thee this time,'  said his grandmother; 'but if these tales reach thy father's ears, he  will not be so tender as I am towards thee.'    And, sure enough, the very next time that a complaint was made from the  school, his father happened to be at home, and then the storm burst.    'Next time I will flog thee,' said Ser Piero sternly, with rising anger  at the careless air of the boy. 'Meanwhile we will see what a little  imprisonment will do towards making thee a better child.'    Then he took the boy by the shoulders and led him to a little dark  cupboard under the stairs, and there shut him up for three whole days.    There was no kicking or beating at the locked door. Leonardo sat  quietly there in the dark, thinking his own thoughts, and wondering why  there seemed so little justice in the world. But soon even that wonder  passed away, and as usual when he was alone he began to dream dreams of  the time when he should have learned the swallows' secrets and should  have wings like theirs.    But if there were complaints about Leonardo's dislike of the boys and  the Latin grammar, there would be none about the lessons he chose to  learn. Indeed, some of the masters began to dread the boy's eager  questions, which were sometimes more than they could answer. Scarcely  had he begun the study of arithmetic than he made such rapid progress,  and wanted to puzzle out so many problems, that the masters were  amazed. His mind seemed always eagerly asking for more light, and was  never satisfied.    But it was out on the hillside that he spent his happiest hours. He  loved every crawling, creeping, or flying thing, however ugly. Curious  beasts which might have frightened another child were to him charming  and interesting. There as he listened to the carolling of the birds and  bent his head to catch the murmured song of the mountain-streams, the  love of music began to steal into his heart.    He did not rest then until he managed to get a lute and learned how to  play upon it. And when he had mastered the notes and learned the rules  of music, he began to play airs which no one had ever heard before, and  to sing such strange sweet songs that the golden notes flowed out as  fresh and clear as the song of a lark in the early morning of spring.    'The child is a changeling,' said some, as they saw Leonardo tenderly  lift a crushed lizard in his hand, or watched him play with a spotted  snake or great hairy spider.    'A changeling perhaps,' said others, 'but one that hath the voice of an  angel.' For every one stopped to listen when the boy's voice was heard  singing through the streets of the little town.    He was a puzzle to every one, and yet a delight to all, even when they  understood him least.    So time went on, and when Leonardo was thirteen his father took him  away to Florence that he might begin to be trained for some special  work. But what work? Ah! that was the rub. The boy could do so many  things well that it was difficult to fix on one.    At that time there was living in Florence an old man who knew a great  deal about the stars, and who made wonderful calculations about them.  He was a famous astronomer, but he cared not at all for honour or fame,  but lived a simple quiet life by himself and would not mix with the gay  world.    Few visitors ever came to see him, for it was known that he would  receive no one, and so it was a great surprise to old Toscanelli when  one night a gentle knock sounded at his door, and a boy walked quietly  in and stood before him.    Hastily the old man looked up, and his first thought was to ask the  child "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#15)"],[1,"isters, mamma, our cousin, and I went after  dinner to Herr Stein's. At four o'clock came the Capellmeister and  Herr Schmittbauer, the organist of St. Ulrich, a worthy good old man.  I played at sight a sonata of Becke's, which was rather difficult, but  very poor, al solito. The astonishment of the Capellmeister and the  organist was indescribable. I have played my six sonatas by heart  repeatedly, both here and in Munich. The fifth in G, I played at  the distinguished Casino concert, and the last in D, which has an  incomparable effect on Stein's pianos. The pedals, pressed by the knees,  are also better made by him than by any one else; you scarcely require  to touch them to make them act, and as soon as the pressure is removed  not the slightest vibration is perceptible.    To-morrow perhaps I shall come to his organs, that is, write to you  about them, and I reserve for the last the subject of his little  daughter. When I said to Herr Stein that I should like to play on one of  his organs, as the organ was my passion, he seemed surprised, and  said, \"What! such a man as you, so great a pianist, like to play on an  instrument devoid of sweetness and expression, with no gradations from  piano to forte, but always going on the same?\" \"That does not signify;  the organ always was, both in my eyes and ears, the king of all  instruments.\" \"Well, just as you please.\" So we went together. I could  readily perceive from his conversation that he did not expect me to do  great things on his organ, evidently thinking that I should handle it  in the style of a piano. He told me that by Schobert's own desire he  had taken him also to the organ, \"and very nervous it made me,\" said he,  \"for Schobert had told everybody, and the church was nearly full. I did  not doubt the man's spirit, fire, and execution; still, this does not  much suit the organ. But the moment he began my opinion was entirely  changed.\" I only said in reply, \"Do you then think, Herr Stein, that  I am likely to run wild on the organ?\" \"Oh! you!\"--When we came to the  organ-loft, I began a prelude, when he laughed. A fugue followed. \"I can  now quite understand why you like to play the organ,\" said he, \"when you  can play in this manner.\" At first the pedal was a little awkward for  me, as it was without the breaks, beginning with C, then D E in one row,  whereas with us D and E are above, just where E flat and F sharp are  here; but I quickly mastered it.    I went also to try the old organ at St. Ulrich's. The stair that leads  to it is really dreadful. I requested that some other person might play  the organ for me, that I might go down and listen to it, for above the  organ has no effect; but I profited very little by this, for the young  leader of the choir, a priest, made such reckless runs on the organ that  it was impossible to understand them, and when he attempted harmonies  they proved only discords, being always false. Afterwards they would  insist on our going to a coffee-room, for mamma and my cousin were with  us. A certain Father Emilian, a conceited jackass and a sorry witling,  was very sweet on my cousin, and wished to have his jest with her,  but she made a jest of him. At last, when rather tipsy, (which soon  occurred,) he began to talk about music, and sang a canon, saying, \"I  never in my life heard anything finer.\" I said, \"I regret that I can't  sing it with you, for nature has not given me the power of intoning.\"  \"No matter,\" said he. So he began. I made the third, but I sang  different words--thus: \"Pater Emilian, oh! thou numskull\"--sotto voce to  my cousin; then we laughed on for at least half an hour. The Pater said  to me, \"If we only could be longer together, we could discuss the art of  musical composition.\" \"In that case,\" said I, \"our discussion would soon  come to an end.\" A famous rap on the knuckles for him! TO BE CONTINUED.        68.    Augsburg, Oct. 23, 1777.    MY concert took place yesterday. Count Wolfeck interested himself much  in it, and brought some chanoinesses with him. I went to his lodgings  the very day I arrived, but he was not here at that time. A few days  ago he returned, and on hearing that I was still in Augsburg, he did not  wait for a visit from me, but at the very moment when I was taking my  hat and sword to go to call on him he walked in. I must now give you a  description of the last few days before my concert. Last Saturday I was  at St. Ulrich's, as I already told you. Some days before my cousin  took me with him to present me to the Prelate of the Holy Cross, a kind  excellent old man. Previous to going to St. Ulrich's last Saturday, I  went with my cousin to the Monastery of the Holy Cross, as the first  time I was there neither the Deacon nor the Procurator was at home,  and my cousin told me that the Procurator was very jolly. [Here mamma  inserts a few lines--which frequently occurs in the letters. She says at  the close:] \"I am quite surprised that Schuster's duets [see No. 63] are  still\"--Wolfgang: \"Oh, he has got them.\" Mamma: \"No, indeed; he always  writes that he has not got them.\" Wolfgang: \"I hate arguing; I am sure  he has got them, so there's an end of it.\" Mamma: \"You are mistaken.\"  Wolfgang: \"No; I am right. I will show it to mamma in his own writing.\"  Mamma: \"Well, where is it?\" Wolfgang: \"Here; read it.\" She is reading it  at this moment.    Last Sunday I attended service at the Holy Cross, and at ten o'clock we  went to Herr Stein's, where we tried over a couple of symphonies for the  concert. Afterwards I dined with my cousin at the Holy Cross, where a  band played during dinner. Badly as they play in the monastery, I prefer  it to the Augsburg orchestra. I played a symphony, and a concerto in  B of Vanhall's, on the violin, with unanimous applause. The Dean is  a kind, jovial man, a cousin of Eberlin [deceased Capellmeister of  Salzburg]. His name is Zeschinger. He knows papa well. At night, after  supper, I played the Strassburg concerto; it went as smooth as oil;  every one praised the fine pure tone. A small clavichord was then  brought in, on which I preluded, and played a sonata and the Fischer  variations. Some of those present whispered to the Dean that he ought to  hear me play in the organ style. I asked him to give me a theme, which  he declined, but one of the monks did so. I handled it quite leisurely,  and all at once (the fugue being in G minor) I brought in a lively  movement in the major key, but in the same tempo, and then at the end  the original subject, only reversed. At last it occurred to me to  employ the lively movement for the subject of the fugue also, I did not  hesitate long, but did so at once, and it went as accurately as if Daser  [a Salzburg tailor] had taken its measure. The Dean was in a state of  great excitement. \"It is over,\" said he, \"and it's no use talking about  it, but I could scarcely have believed what I have just heard; you are  indeed an able man. My prelate told me beforehand that in his life he  never heard any one play the organ in a more finished and solid style\"  (he having heard me some days previously when the Dean was not here). At  last some one brought me a fugued sonata, and asked me to play it. But I  said, \"Gentlemen, I really must say this is asking rather too much,  for it is not likely I shall be able to play such a sonata at sight.\"  \"Indeed, I think so too; it is too much; no one could do it,\" said the  Dean eagerly, being all in my favor. \"At all events,\" said I, \"I can but  try.\" I heard the Dean muttering all the time behind me, \"Oh, you rogue!  oh, you knave!\" I played till 11 o'clock, bombarded and besieged, as it  were, by fugue themes.    Lately, at Stein's, he brought me a sonata of Becke's, but I think  I already told you this. A propos, as to his little girl, [Footnote:  Nanette, at that time eight years old; afterwards the admirable wife  of Andreas Streicher, the friend of Schiller's youth, and one of  Beethoven's best friends in Vienna.] any one who can see and hear her  play without laughing must be Stein [stone] like her father. She perches  herself exactly opposite the treble, avoiding the centre, that she may  have more room to throw herself about and make grimaces. She rolls her  eyes and smirks; when a passage comes twice she always plays it slower  the second time, and if three times, slower still. She raises her arms  in playing a passage, and if it is to be played with emphasis she seems  to give it with her elbows and not her fingers, as awkwardly and heavily  as possible. The finest thing is, that if a passage occurs (which ought  to flow like oil) where the fingers must necessarily be changed, she  does not pay much heed to that, but lifts her hands, and quite coolly  goes on again. This, moreover, puts her in a fair way to get hold of a  wrong note, which often produces a curious effect. I only write this in  order to give you some idea of pianoforte-playing and teaching here, so  that you may in turn derive some benefit from it. Herr Stein is quite  infatuated about his daughter. She is eight years old, and learns  everything by heart. She may one day be clever, for she has genius, but  on this system she will never improve, nor will she ever acquire much  velocity of finger, for her present method is sure to make her hand  heavy. She will never master what is the most difficult and necessary,  and in fact the principal thing in music, namely, time; because from her  infancy she has never been in the habit of playing in correct time.  Herr Stein and I discussed this point together for at least two hours.  I have, however, in some degree converted him; he asks my advice now on  every subject. He was quite devoted to Becke, and now he sees and hears  that I can do more than Becke, that I make no grimaces, and yet play  with so much expression that he himself acknowledges none of his  acquaintances have ever handled his pianos as I do.
