I'm in a fever and I ache with  longing for 'ee till I feel as if I should go mad----\"    Gray caught her breath in a sob, as a soft trundling sound came from the  next room.  Unable to speak she pointed shakily at the door.    Leadville also heard the sound, a scrooping noise as of rubber-tyred  wheels being turned about.  Sabina was in the kitchen, could hear every  word, would probably, in another minute, roll herself in at the linhay  door.  His face grew savage and rage rose in a black flood about his  heart.  Was it to be always like this, was this poor remnant of  humanity, feeble, distorted, ageing, always to come between him and  Gray?  His mind grew blurry with a wild spindrift of menace.  Green  withes or new ropes, fools to think he could be bound by either law or  convention, he whom only the lustreless black hair of one woman might  hold.  Love had come late, but it had come in overwhelming force and he  would break every convention, every law that stood in his way!  Laws?    As he stood, stricken dumb by his wife's nearness, but on the edge of  passionate revolt he became conscious of a peculiar change in his  surroundings.  Silence fell, a thick silence like a wall, a silence that  shut out the cackle of a hen in the yard and the distant baa-ing that  came irregularly from the hillside.  The man was alone behind this wall  of soundlessness, shut away by it from the homely noises of the indoor  and the out.  When it had lasted for a bewildering second, it was  succeeded by a faint far-off sound.  The sound came out of a red  distance and grew rapidly louder, resolving itself at last into the  regular tap-tap of a hammer which is being used for knocking in nails.  This hammering was to Byron a familiar sound. It had been heard by him  at other times of stress and strain, at other moments when raging  passions seemed about to drive him over some dark verge.  The sound was  arresting.  It went as he well knew with flashes of vision, during which  he would see a piece of light wood and the glint of brass-headed tacks.  As the wood appeared out of the white mist which surrounded him, Byron  passed into another state of consciousness.  His mind, abruptly  disconnected, was filled with a queer eagerness and curiosity.  His  wife, Gray, Wastralls, everything, were momentarily forgotten.  What was  it, this knocking? No carpenter was at work in the houses and courts;  and the wood too, a full curve narrowing to an angle, was a curious  shape.  He stared about him, seeking an explanation and his eye fell on  the girl at her work.    \"Did you 'ear?\" he said, turning on her a face from which the tide of  emotion had ebbed.    Gray, thankful for the respite which had followed her aunt's entry, had  seized the pats and, with feverish industry was cutting pounds and half  pounds off the mass of butter.    \"I heard Aunt S'bina in the kitchen,\" she answered coldly.    \"I wasn't speaking of 'er.  I meant the knockin'.\"    \"What knocking?\"    \"I didn't know as the mason was comin' to-day to put up the new pigs'  'ouse?\"    \"He isn't coming till after Christmas.\"    \"Well, I'm sure I 'eard some one 'ammerin' in nails.\"    She shook her head.  \"I didn't hear it.\"    The noise of dishes being piled together on the breakfast table caught  Byron's attention.  He glanced at Gray and the sight of youth, with a  blush on the hot cheek, a suggestion of tears on the long lashes, was to  him as the opening of a door.  He came out of his preoccupation and the  knocking either died away or was forgotten. Forgotten, too, were his  rage and disappointment.    \"What's she doin' out o' bed so early for?\"    \"I'm going into Stowe with the butter and there's a lot to do.\"    \"'Oo yer gwine with?\" asked Byron, instantly on the alert.    \"With Jim.\"    \"You needn't go.\"  He was reluctant to have her out of his reach, even  for a morning.  He wanted her at home under his eye.  He was going to  renew his pleading as soon as the moment was auspicious.  \"Rosevear can  take that in.\"    \"I want to go to-day.\"    His mind examined the statement with that ever-ready fear of the lover  who is uncertain of his standing.  \"What you want to go for?\"    \"Shopping!\" said she and, with a smile that was faintly malicious,  enumerated the items, groceries, liniment for her aunt, pitchers, cloam  pans.    \"Shopping?\"  But what he saw was that five-mile drive over Big Hill into  Stowe.  He saw her beside Jim, driving away from Wastralls, from him.  \"I'll drive 'ee in!\"    Gray's heart sank and she remained silent.    \"Would 'ee like me to?\"    If she said 'No,' he would be all the more eager. \"Once I'm in Stowe I  shall be that busy you wouldn't see anything of me.\"    He laughed.  \"I'd take care of that.  All right then, 'tis I as'll drive  'ee into Stowe and not the lad.  I'll not trust Rosevear to drive 'ee,  I'll do it myself.\"  He looked back at her from the door, his dark face  alight. \"My God, if I caught 'ee with one of they, I'd--I'd break his  neck.\"    The door banged to behind him, and Gray putting down the printer laid  her head on her arms.  If Aunt Sabina should not be able to prevent him!    But Aunt Sabina was a tower of strength.                                       *CHAPTER VIII*      In order that Gray might start for the market in good time, Mrs. Byron  had swung herself out of bed that morning as soon as she had swallowed  her simple breakfast of tea and buttered split.  But though she had  brush, comb, garments, in fact all toilet necessaries at hand, and could  therefore dress expeditiously, she found when she reached the kitchen  that day was breaking. A red sun, having topped the south-easterly  slopes of Brown Willy and Rowtor, was smiling in at the many-paned  window and winning an answering brightness from surfaces of steel, of  yellow glaze and of glass. Mrs. Byron's eye as she pushed the trolly  into the room took in the homely details.  To the right of the range  yawned a cloam oven and, before long, Jim Rosevear would be bringing  faggots of tamarisk wood with which to fill it.  Before the fire in a  deep pan the dough was 'plumping' under a linen cloth, and nothing makes  a house so homely as dough on a low chair 'plumping' in kitchen warmth  and stillness.  As she gathered the breakfast crocks together,  preparatory to cleansing them, she smiled to herself well-pleased.  Her  plans were working smoothly and although the past year had been one of  change and discomfort, she could believe that the disturbance, like  yeast in flour, would bring good results. Mrs. Byron's movements were  still quick and deft.  She set the remains of the fry aside, poured hot  water into the wooden tub for washing up and stood the knives, blade  down, in a pot.  The trolly, being of cane and shivered wood, ran  lightly over the blue flags; but as she turned from putting the refilled  kettle on the fire she heard voices in the linhay, the deep bass murmur  that was her husband's and a clearer sound, the voice of some one young  and troubled, of some one angered, but also afraid.    The smile died off Mrs. Byron's lips and for some minutes she stared  unseeingly at the steaming water in the round wooden bowl.  So he was at  his tricks, the old villain!  She had taken the matter lightly as a  vagary, a passing fancy: but as the sound of his voice fell upon her  ears she experienced a doubt, the first real doubt that she had known.  In these tones there was a passion wholly new to her.  It shook the  wife's heart with fear, the fear of ultimate irremediable loss; with  such fear, that for the moment she went sick and faint and leaned  perilously forward in the cone of her trolly.    In the linhay, the voices dropped into silence and, when they began  again, they were pitched in a more commonplace key.  Sabina, sitting by  the table, stunned by a late realization of what had happened, heard a  well-known step, a pause and the utterance in quick, fierce tones, of  some threatening phrase.  Upon that, Leadville came quickly into the  kitchen.    \"S'bina,\" he said and she noticed with a fresh pang that his face wore a  warm and eager look, a look of happy anticipation, \"I want the money for  they veares.\"    The year's pigs had been made into hams and bacon and Mrs. Byron,  discussing the matter with old George, had decided not to buy young  animals--veares or slips--until the New Year.  She could not understand  why Leadville should want to restock the empty sties.  What was it to do  with him?    \"Pigs,\" she said non-committally, \"'ull be cheaper after Christmas.\"    \"They won't go down again.\"    \"I know they will.  You can get good-sized slips after Christmas for  less money than you'll give for veares now.\"    He thrust his hands into empty pockets and tried to think of another way  in which he could procure money. How could he take Gray into Stowe if he  had none? He wanted to give her pretty things, to spend on her, to  impress her: but he could not ask the one woman for money to throw away  on the other.  \"Ah,\" said he, \"but I can go to-day and get them and  after Christmas I shan't be able to.\"    Only then did Mrs. Byron remember the errand upon which Gray was bound,  the errand which was taking her into Stowe.  She smiled and a tinge of  malice crept into her thoughts.    \"It bain't often as you're so keen to do things for us,\" she said, \"and  I didn't know as you'd time to spare.\"    \"Iss, I can spend the day in buyin' they veares for 'ee and welcome.\"    \"There's things as I want more'n veares.  Wi' the wind off the land  there'll be a pretty lot of oreweed in the bay.  You might give a hand  to that.\"    \"I been down and there 'edn't a bit in.\"    She knew that he had not been farther than the yard that morning.  \"I  don't say 'no' to a fair offer,\" she said, her upper lip lifting a  little over the still white and regular teeth.  \"They turmits want  bringin' in from the Willows Field, else the rabbits will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#15)"],[1,"least  she might dare to attack Robert on that point. It was like being a deaf  person not to understand the words spoken around one. And once she had  obtained some command of the language she would be in a position to give  her own orders to the other servants without Sher Singh's intervention.    She waited until they were in the drawing-room, and Robert had flung  himself into an easy chair to examine some official document. He worked  very hard, and seemed to think of little else.    \"Robert,\" she began softly. He did not hear her. She repeated his name  and he looked up abstractedly. Then he lowered the sheets of foolscap  and removed his pince-nez.    \"What is it now?\" he inquired with indulgent resignation.    \"Can I have lessons in Hindustani?\"    \"Why? What good would that do you?\"    \"I want to learn, and I have nothing particular to do while you are at  work all day.\"    \"You've got the piano, and you can order what books you want from  Bombay. Haven't you any fancy work?\"    She laughed. \"Fancy work! I want to use my brains.\"    \"Don't talk nonsense. What good will Hindustani do your brains? Keep up  your French and music. Natives respect Englishwomen far more if they  can't speak the language.\"    \"Oh, Robert, what a thing to say! I'm sure that can't be true.\"    \"You know nothing about it, you silly child. Come here!\"    She had risen and was moving restlessly about the room. As she passed he  put out his arm and pulled her down on to his knees. With a strong  effort she controlled her reluctance, realising, suddenly aghast, that  her distaste for Robert's demonstrations of affection was on the  increase, that it threatened to develop into actual aversion. As he  pressed her face against his shoulder, kissing her hair, a sort of  desperation seized her. She did not love Robert, had never loved him,  and at this moment she almost hated him. The question rose in her mind:  Was it because they had known she was not in love with Robert that  grandmamma and the aunts had shown so little sympathy with her marriage,  had behaved as if she were doing something reprehensible? If so, why  had they not warned her? Yet, supposing they had gone so far as to put  probable consequences before her, would she have heeded, believed them?  No, she knew well enough that in her headstrong simplicity nothing would  then have turned her from her purpose. If anyone was to blame in the  matter it was Robert, who had married her to please himself only,  regardless of her ignorance of life and love, even partly, perhaps,  because of it. She recalled a sentence in the letter Maud Verrall had  written announcing her engagement: \"I am very happy and awfully in  love.\" If only she was in love with Robert! But she was not, she never  could be. Did he know it? Not that she believed he would care one way or  the other as long as she submitted to his will in every detail. But at  least she did not intend to submit with regard to learning Hindustani.  More than ever did she feel that congenial occupation of mind was a  necessity, that if she could not satisfy her craving for knowledge of  the country she would rather have stayed on at The Chestnuts. How could  she hope to understand India, as far as it was possible for an  Englishwoman to do so, till she was able to talk to the people? She had  already discovered that India for its own sake did not interest Robert.  He worked hard because he liked work. He had a clear, hard brain; the  mode of existence suited him; he appreciated his big pay and the  importance of his position; natives were afraid of him, and he liked to  inspire fear. He never talked to her of his work, or of the people and  their histories and religions, and now he did not want her to learn the  language, beyond the smattering that would suffice for her daily  requirements.    However, learn it she would. And a means, though repugnant, of gaining  her ends occurred to her. Bracing her will, she slipped her arm about  his neck and laid her lips to his cheek. \"You are _Satan_ Sahib now,\"  she murmured plaintively. \"I don't like you at all.\"    His grasp of her tightened. \"Why, what have I done?\"    \"The first little thing I have ever asked for you refuse me!\"    \"What was it?\"    Good heavens! Were her wishes so trivial to him that they could pass  from his mind on the spot?    She answered his question without betrayal of her resentment. \"That I  should learn Hindustani properly.\"    \"What a little pest! Well, if I say 'yes,' how much will you love  Santa-Sahib?\"    \"Ever and ever so much,\" she cooed, knowing that half measures would be  useless, that she must pay, and pay fully, for what she wanted.    \"All right, then we must see about a respectable old _munshi_, who won't  let you work too hard or teach you bad words. After all, if you must use  what you call your brains, it may be better for you than French novels.  But remember, if you're going to pose as a clever woman I'll divorce you  at once!\"    \"I don't think you'll get rid of me quite so easily,\" she laughed. The  victory elated her. In future she would have no scruple as to this  method of conquest when the object she desired was worth it. So she  sipped her first taste of the power of sex hypocrisy, scented the  supreme value of feminine arts and wiles.          CHAPTER VIII      Stella was careful to conceal from Robert the pleasure she found in her  lessons with the white-bearded, horn-spectacled patriarch appointed her  tutor. Having attained her desire through guile, she did not intend to  risk deprivation through candour. Now and then, as a precaution, she  would allude jokingly to her studies, sometimes feigned to be weary of  them, implying that only a determination not to be baffled by a  self-imposed task caused her to persevere; and Robert, who regarded the  matter as a whim that would pass, made no further obstruction. During  the hours while he was safely at office she worked zealously, and the  progress she made surprised her, unconscious as she was of her own  mental ability. Soon she could carry on simple conversations with the  old teacher, and she forbade Champa to speak to her in English, greatly  to the disgust of that accomplished female, who feared that her prestige  in the compound as interpreter to the memsahib might suffer.    Champa sulked, and in some mysterious fashion seemed to join forces with  Sher Singh in creating an atmosphere of espionage that to Stella was  intensely exasperating. Did she give an order on her own account, it was  caught up at once and repeated elaborately by the ayah; if she wandered  in the garden Sher Singh would follow, and when she made objections  both servants professed to misunderstand what she said. She felt she was  being harried, and was unable to discover the reason. Never could she  succeed in exploring the servants' quarters, for Sher Singh was always  at hand; and as Robert had bidden her keep away from the low line of  dwellings that swarmed with people, like a species of human ant-heap,  disobedience might be reported by Sher Singh to his master either with  or without intentional spite. Sometimes Mrs. Cuthell came to see her,  also Mrs. Piggott and Mrs. Antonio, and during their visits Champa  lurked and peeped, or Sher Singh hung about the doorways.    These ladies invited Mrs. Crayfield informally to tea or to tiffin, but  Robert discouraged acceptance, said it was better not to start  intimacies, as if he were jealous of her possible friendships; and  although no real sacrifice was entailed, Stella made capital out of her  refusals--pretended she was foregoing a pleasure for the sole reason  that she wished to follow Santa-Sahib's will. She told herself she was  growing sinfully deceitful; but her apprehension lest her study of the  language should be stopped if she opposed Robert's prejudices in any  other direction was stronger than her conscience. Anything to keep him  amiable. Sometimes she wondered if she had any conscience left.  Therefore Crayfield remained complacently convinced of his young wife's  devotion. She gave him no trouble, was apparently content to leave the  household control to Sher Singh, always looked lovely and fresh and  sweet-tempered, and he desired no more. Wit and wisdom, intelligent  conversation on her part would merely have bored him, rendered him  vaguely suspicious. In his opinion women were better without education,  which, all the same, was not to be confounded with what he regarded as  \"accomplishments.\" He liked her to sing pretty ballads and play waltzes;  he enjoyed singing to her sympathetic accompaniment; and when she  attempted to paint flowers and kingfishers and storks, or embroider  strips of \"crash\" with intricate patterns in coloured cottons, on the  lines of Mrs. Daw's remembered achievements, he criticised the results  with patronising encouragement.    Thus the days passed smoothly. Rides in the late afternoon, a few formal  dinners to \"the station,\" the weekly \"at homes,\" music in the evenings,  until, shortly before Christmas, they went into camp on a tour of  inspection. This meant double sets of tents, quantities of folding  furniture, camels and carts and followers innumerable; it was a kind of  royal progress. They passed from district to district, joining camps  with various officials who came within the Commissioner's jurisdiction,  friendly people to be entertained by their chief, entertaining him and  his pretty wife in return. Stella revelled in the long marches on  horseback, in the brilliant \"cold weather,\" the small game shooting  parties in the evenings when work was over, and the ever interesting  background of villages, crops and cattle. She felt that such  compensations made it worth while to be Santa-Sahib's plaything,  especially as her lessons could be continued with the old _munshi_, who  had somehow provided himself with a tent like a candle extinguisher and  a small cow-hocked pony at Government"]]]
