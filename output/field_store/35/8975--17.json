At Melle we came upon the blazing  cottages we had seen pictured the night before. Here we  encountered a roving band of Belgian soldiers who were in a free  and careless mood and evinced a ready willingness to put  themselves at our disposal. Under the command of the photographers,  they charged across the fields with fixed bayonets, wriggled up  through the grass, or, standing behind the trenches, blazed away  with their guns at an imaginary enemy. They did some good acting,  grim and serious as death. All except one.    This youth couldn't suppress his sense of humor. He could not, or  would not, keep from laughing, even when he was supposed to be  blowing the head off a Boche. He was properly disciplined and put  out of the game, and we went on with our maneuvers to the  accompaniment of the clicking cameras until the photographers  had gathered in a fine lot of realistic fighting-line pictures.    One of the photographers sat stolidly in the automobile smoking  his cigarette while the others were reaping their harvest.    \"Why don't you take these too?\" I asked.    \"Oh,\" he replied, \"I've been sending in so much of that stuff that I  just got a telegram from my paper saying, 'Pension off that Belgian  regiment which is doing stunts in the trenches.'\"    While his little army rested from their maneuvers the Director-in-  Chief turned to me and said:    \"Wouldn't you like to have a photograph of yourself in these war-  surroundings, just to take home as a souvenir?\"    That appealed to me. After rejecting some commonplace  suggestions, he exclaimed: \"I have it. Shot as a German Spy.  There's the wall to stand up against; and we'll pick a crack firing-  squad out of these Belgians. A little bit of all right, eh?\"    I acquiesced in the plan and was led over to the wall while a  movie-man whipped out a handkerchief and tied it over my eyes.  The director then took the firing squad in hand. He had but  recently witnessed the execution of a spy where he had almost  burst with a desire to photograph the scene. It had been  excruciating torture to restrain himself. But the experience had  made him feel conversant with the etiquette of shooting a spy, as it  was being done amongst the very best firing-squads. He made it  now stand him in good stead.    \"Aim right across the bandage,\" the director coached them. I could  hear one of the soldiers laughing excitedly as he was warming up  to the rehearsal. It occurred to me that I was reposing a lot of  confidence in a stray band of soldiers. Some one of those  Belgians, gifted with a lively imagination, might get carried away  with the suggestion and act as if I really were a German spy.    \"Shoot the blooming blighter in the eye,\" said one movie man  playfully.    \"Bally good idea!\" exclaimed the other one approvingly, while one  eager actor realistically clicked his rifle-hammer. That was  altogether too much. I tore the bandage from my eyes, exclaiming:    \"It would be a bally good idea to take those cartridges out first.\"  Some fellow might think his cartridge was blank or try to fire wild,  just as a joke in order to see me jump. I wasn't going to take any  risk and flatly refused to play my part until the cartridges were  ejected. Even when the bandage was readjusted \"Didn't-know-it-  was-loaded\" stories still were haunting me. In a moment,  however, it was over and I was promised my picture within a  fortnight.    A week later I picked up the London Daily Mirror from a  newsstand. It had the caption:      Belgian Soldiers Shoot a German Spy Caught at Termonde      I opened up the paper and what was my surprise to see a big  spread picture of myself, lined up against that row of Melle  cottages and being shot for the delectation of the British public.  There is the same long raincoat that runs as a motif through all the  other pictures. Underneath it were the words:    \"The Belgians have a short, sharp method of dealing with the  Kaiser's rat-hole spies. This one was caught near Termonde and,  after being blindfolded, the firing-squad soon put an end to his  inglorious career.\"    One would not call it fame exactly, even though I played the star-  role. But it is a source of some satisfaction to have helped a royal  lot of fellows to a first-class scoop. As the \"authentic spy-picture of  the war,\" it has had a broadcast circulation. I have seen it in  publications ranging all the way from The Police Gazette to  \"Collier's Photographic History of the European War.\" In a  university club I once chanced upon a group gathered around this  identical picture. They were discussing the psychology of this \"poor  devil\" in the moments before he was shot. It was a further source  of satisfaction to step in and arbitrarily contradict all their  conclusions and, having shown them how totally mistaken they  were, proceed to tell them exactly how the victim felt. This high-  handed manner nettled one fellow terribly:    \"Not so arbitrary, my friend!\" he said. \"You haven't any right to be  so devilish cocksure.\"    \"Haven't I?\" I replied. \"Who has any better right? I happen to be  that identical man!\" But that little episode has been of real value to  me. It is said that if one goes through the motions he gets the  emotions. I believe that I have an inkling of how a man feels when  he momentarily expects a volley of cold lead to turn his skull into a  sieve.    That was a very timely picture. It filled a real demand. For spies  were at that time looming distressingly large in the public mind.  The deeds they had done, or were about to do, cast a cold fear  over men by day and haunted them by night. They were in the  Allies' councils, infesting the army, planning destruction to the  navy. Any wild tale got credence, adding its bit to the general  paralysis, and producing a vociferous demand that \"something be  done.\" The people were assured that all culprits were being duly  sentenced and shot. But there was no proof of it. There were no  pictures thereof extant. And that is what the public wanted.    \"Give the public what it wants,\" was the motto of this enterprising  newspaper man. Herewith he supplied tangible evidence on which  they could feast their eyes and soothe their nerves.    As to the ethics of these pictures, they are \"true\" in that they are  faithful to reality. In this case the photographer acted up to his  professional knowledge and staged the pictures as he had actually  seen the spy shot. They must find their justification on the same  basis as fiction, which is \"the art of falsifying facts for the sake of  truth.\" And who would begrudge them the securing of a few  pictures with comparative ease?    Most of the pictures which the public casually gazes on have been  secured at a price--and a large one, too. The names of these men  who go to the front with cameras, rather than with rifles or pens,  are generally unknown. They are rarely found beneath the  pictures, yet where would be our vivid impression of courage in  daring and of skill in doing, of cunning strategy upon the field of  battle, of wounded soldiers sacrificing for their comrades, if we had  no pictures? A few pictures are faked, but behind most pictures  there is another tale of daring and of strategy, and that is the tale  concerning the man who took it. That very day thrice these same  men risked their lives.    The apparatus loaded in the car, we were off again. Past a few  barricades of paving-stones and wagons, past the burned houses  which marked the place where the Germans had come within five  miles of Ghent, we encountered some uniformed Belgians who  looked quite as dismal and dispirited as the fog which hung above  the fields. They were the famous Guarde Civique of Belgium. Our  Union Jack, flapping in the wind, was very likely quite the most  thrilling spectacle they had seen in a week, and they hailed it with a  cheer and a cry of \"Vive l'Angleterre!\" (Long live England!) The  Guarde Civique had a rather inglorious time of it. Wearisomely in  their wearisome-looking uniform, they stood for hours on their  guns or marched and counter-marched in dreary patrolling, often  doomed not even to scent the battle from afar off.    Whenever we were called to a halt for the examination of our  passports, these men crowded around and begged for newspapers.  We held up our stock, and they would clamor for the ones with  pictures. The English text was unintelligible to most of them, but  the pictures they could understand, and they bore them away to  enjoy the sight of other soldiers fighting, even if they themselves  were denied that excitement. Our question to them was always  the same, \"Where are the Germans?\"    Out of the conflicting reports it was hard to tell whether the  Germans were heading this way or not. That they were expected  was shown by the sign-posts whose directions had just been  obliterated by fresh paint--a rather futile operation, because the  Germans had better maps and plans of the region than the  Belgians themselves, maps which showed every by-path, well and  barn. The chauffeur's brother had been shot in his car by the  Germans but a week before, and he didn't relish the idea of thus  flaunting the enemy's flag along a road where some German  scouting party might appear at any moment. The Union Jack had  done good service in getting us easy passage so far, but the driver  was not keen for going further with it.    It was proposed to turn the car around and back it down the road,  as had been done the previous day. Thus the car would be  headed in the home direction, and at sight of the dreaded uniform  we could make a quick leap for safety. At this juncture, however, I  produced a small Stars and Stripes, which the chauffeur hailed  with delight, and we continued our journey now under the aegis of  a neutral flag.    It might have secured temporary safety, but only "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#16)"],[1,"ne_, a Paris club, noted for its good dinners, but every member  was of necessity a poet (1727-1811).    _The Persian Anacreon_, Mahommed Hafiz.

ANDROCLUS AND THE LION. Androclus was a runaway Roman slave, who took  refuge in a cavern. A lion entered, and instead of tearing him to  pieces, lifted up its fore-paw that Androclus might extract from it a  thorn. The fugitive, being subsequently captured, was doomed to fight  with a lion in the Roman arena, and it so happened that the very same  lion was let out against him; it instantly recognized its benefactor,  and began to fawn upon him with every token of gratitude and joy. The  story being told of this strange behavior, Androclus was forthwith set  free.    A somewhat similar anecdote is told of sir George Davis, English  consul at Florence at the beginning of the present century. One day  he went to see the lions of the great duke of Tuscany. There was one  which the keepers could not tame, but no sooner did sir George appear,  than the beast manifested every symptom of joy. Sir George entered  the cage, when the creature leaped on his shoulder, licked his face,  wagged its tail, and fawned like a dog. Sir George told the great  duke that he had brought up this lion, but as it grew older it became  dangerous, and he sold it to a Barbary captain. The duke said he  bought it of the same man, and the mystery was cleared up.    ANDROMACHE [_An. drom'. a. ky_], widow of Hector. At the downfall of  Troy both she and her son Asty'anax were allotted to Pyrrhus king  of Epirus, and Pyrrhus fell in love with her, but she repelled  his advances. At length a Grecian embassy, led by Orestes son of  Agamemnon, arrived, and demanded that Astyanax should be given up and  put to death, lest in manhood he should attempt to avenge his father's  death. Pyrrhus told Andromache that he would protect her son in  defiance of all Greece if she would become his wife, and she  reluctantly consented thereto. While the marriage ceremonies were  going on, the ambassadors rushed on Pyrrhus and slew him, but as he  fell he placed the crown on the head of Andromache, who thus became  the queen of Epirus, and the ambassadors hastened to their ships in  flight.--Ambrose Philips, _The Distressed Mother_ (1712).    ANDROMEDA, beautiful daughter of the king of Ethiopia. To appease  Neptune, she was bound to a rock to be devoured by Neptune. Perseus  slew the monster and made the maiden his wife.
