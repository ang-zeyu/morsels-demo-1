For after  the full enjoyment of all that is truly good, which is found in virtuous  pursuits alone, decorated with consular and triumphal ornaments, what  more could fortune contribute to his elevation? Immoderate wealth did  not fall to his share, yet he possessed a decent affluence. [147] His  wife and daughter surviving, his dignity unimpaired, his reputation  flourishing, and his kindred and friends yet in safety, it may even be  thought an additional felicity that he was thus withdrawn from impending  evils. For, as we have heard him express his wishes of continuing to the  dawn of the present auspicious day, and beholding Trajan in the imperial  seat,--wishes in which he formed a certain presage of the event; so it  is a great consolation, that by his untimely end he escaped that latter  period, in which Domitian, not by intervals and remissions, but by a  continued, and, as it were, a single act, aimed at the destruction of  the commonwealth. [148]    45. Agricola did not behold the senate-house besieged, and the senators  enclosed by a circle of arms; [149] and in one havoc the massacre of so  many consular men, the flight and banishment of so many honorable women.  As yet Carus Metius [150] was distinguished only by a single victory;  the counsels of Messalinus [151] resounded only through the Albanian  citadel; [152] and Massa Baebius [153] was himself among the accused.  Soon after, our own hands [154] dragged Helvidius [155] to prison;  ourselves were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and Rusticus,  [156] and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio. [157]    Even Nero withdrew his eyes from the cruelties he commanded. Under  Domitian, it was the principal part of our miseries to behold and to be  beheld: when our sighs were registered; and that stern countenance, with  its settled redness, [158] his defence against shame, was employed in  noting the pallid horror of so many spectators. Happy, O Agricola! not  only in the splendor of your life, but in the seasonableness of your  death. With resignation and cheerfulness, from the testimony of those  who were present in your last moments, did you meet your fate, as  if striving to the utmost of your power to make the emperor appear  guiltless. But to myself and your daughter, besides the anguish of  losing a parent, the aggravating affliction remains, that it was not our  lot to watch over your sick-bed, to support you when languishing, and to  satiate ourselves with beholding and embracing you. With what attention  should we have received your last instructions, and engraven them on our  hearts! This is our sorrow; this is our wound: to us you were lost four  years before by a tedious absence. Everything, doubtless, O best of  parents! was administered for your comfort and honor, while a most  affectionate wife sat beside you; yet fewer tears were shed upon your  bier, and in the last light which your eyes beheld, something was still  wanting.    46. If there be any habitation for the shades of the virtuous; if, as  philosophers suppose, exalted souls do not perish with the body; may  you repose in peace, and call us, your household, from vain regret and  feminine lamentations, to the contemplation of your virtues, which allow  no place for mourning or complaining! Let us rather adorn your memory by  our admiration, by our short-lived praises, and, as far as our natures  will permit, by an imitation of your example. This is truly to honor the  dead; this is the piety of every near relation. I would also recommend  it to the wife and daughter of this great man, to show their veneration  of a husband's and a father's memory by revolving his actions and words  in their breasts, and endeavoring to retain an idea of the form and  features of his mind, rather than of his person. Not that I would reject  those resemblances of the human figure which are engraven in brass or  marbles but as their originals are frail and perishable, so likewise are  they: while the form of the mind is eternal, and not to be retained  or expressed by any foreign matter, or the artist's skill, but by the  manners of the survivors. Whatever in Agricola was the object of our  love, of our admiration, remains, and will remain in the minds of men,  transmitted in the records of fame, through an eternity of years. For,  while many great personages of antiquity will be involved in a  common oblivion with the mean and inglorious, Agricola shall survive,  represented and consigned to future ages.          FOOTNOTES      A TREATISE ON THE SITUATION, MANNERS AND INHABITANTS OF GERMANY.    [1] This treatise was written in the year of Rome 851, A.D. 98; during  the fourth consulate of the emperor Nerva, and the third of Trajan.    [2] The Germany here meant is that beyond the Rhine. The Germania  Cisrhenana, divided into the Upper and Lower, was a part of Gallia  Belgica.    [3] Rhaetia comprehended the country of the Grisons, with part of Suabia  and Bavaria.    [4] Lower Hungary, and part of Austria.    [5] The Carpathian mountains in Upper Hungary.    [6] \"Broad promontories.\" Latos sinus. Sinus strictly signifies \"a  bending,\" especially inwards. Hence it is applied to a gulf, or bay, of  the sea. And hence, again, by metonymy, to that projecting part of the  land, whereby the gulf is formed; and still further to any promontory  or peninsula. It is in this latter force it is here used;--and refers  especially to the Danish peninsula. See Livy xxvii, 30, xxxviii. 5;  Servius on Virgil, Aen. xi. 626.    [7] Scandinavia and Finland, of which the Romans had a very slight  knowledge, were supposed to be islands.    [8] The mountains of the Grisons. That in which the Rhine rises is at  present called Vogelberg.    [9] Now called Schwartzwald, or the Black Forest. The name Danubius was  given to that portion of the river which is included between its source  and Vindobona (Vienna); throughout the rest of its course it was called  Ister.    [10] _Donec erumpat_. The term _erumpat_ is most correctly and  graphically employed; for the Danube discharges its waters into the  Euxine with so great force, that its course may be distinctly traced for  miles out to sea.    [11] There are now but five.    [12] The ancient writers called all nations _indigenae_ (_i.e._ inde  geniti), or _autochthones_, \"sprung from the soil,\" of whose origin they  were ignorant.    [13] It is, however, well established that the ancestors of the Germans  migrated by land from Asia. Tacitus here falls into a very common kind  of error, in assuming a local fact (viz. the manner in which migrations  took place in the basin of the Mediterranean) to be the expression of a  general law.--ED.    [14] Drusus, father of the emperor Claudius, was the first Roman general  who navigated the German Ocean. The difficulties and dangers which  Germanicus met with from the storms of this sea are related in the  Annals, ii. 23.    [15] All barbarous nations, in all ages, have applied verse to the same  use, as is still found to be the case among the North American Indians.  Charlemagne, as we are told by Eginhart, \"wrote out and committed to  memory barbarous verses of great antiquity, in which the actions and  wars of ancient kings were recorded.\"    [16] The learned Leibnitz supposes this Tuisto to have been the Teut or  Teutates so famous throughout Gaul and Spain, who was a Celto-Scythian  king or hero, and subdued and civilized a great part of Europe and Asia.  Various other conjectures have been formed concerning him and his son  Mannus, but most of them extremely vague and improbable. Among the  rest, it has been thought that in Mannus and his three sons an obscure  tradition is preserved of Adam, and his sons Cain, Abel, and Seth; or of  Noah, and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japhet.    [17] Conringius interprets the names of the sons of Mannus into Ingaeff,  Istaef, and Hermin.    [18] Pliny, iv. 14, embraces a middle opinion between these, and  mentions five capital tribes. The Vindili, to whom belong the  Burgundiones, Varini, Carini, and Guttones; the Ingaevones, including  the Cimbri, Teutoni, and Chauci; the Istaevones, near the Rhine, part  of whom are the midland Cimbri; the Hermiones, containing the Suevi,  Hermunduri, Catti, and Cherusci; and the Peucini and Bastarnae,  bordering upon the Dacians.    [19] The Marsi appear to have occupied various portions of the northwest  part of Germany at various times. In the time of Tiberius (A.D. 14) they  sustained a great slaughter from the forces of Germanicus, who ravaged  their country for fifty miles with fire and sword, sparing neither age  nor sex, neither things profane nor sacred. (See Ann. i. 51.) At this  period they were occupying the country in the neighborhood of the  Rura (Ruhr), a tributary of the Rhine. Probably this slaughter was the  destruction of them as a separate people; and by the time that Trajan  succeeded to the imperial power they seem to have been blotted out from  amongst the Germanic tribes. Hence their name will not be found in the  following account of Germany.    [20] These people are mentioned by Strabo, vii. 1, 3. Their locality is  not very easy to determine.    [21] See note, c. 38.    [22] The Vandals are said to have derived their name from the German  word _wendeln_, \"to wander.\" They began to be troublesome to the Romans  A.D. 160, in the reigns of Aurelius and Verus. In A.D. 410 they made  themselves masters of Spain in conjunction with the Alans and Suevi,  and received for their share what from them was termed Vandalusia  (Andalusia). In A.D. 429 they crossed into Africa under Genseric, who  not only made himself master of Byzacium, Gaetulia, and part of Numidia,  but also crossed over into Italy, A.D. 455, and plundered Rome. After  the death of Genseric the Vandal power declined.    [23] That is, those of the Marsi, Gambrivii, etc. Those of Ingaevones,  Istaevones, and Hermiones, were not so much names of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#15)"],[1," carry their warfare into the  territory of the east and annex the greater part of the AEgean world.    Driven from one city to another, a fugitive without a home, Hannibal at  last knew that the end of his ambitious dream had come. His beloved city  of Carthage had been ruined by the war. She had been forced to sign a  terrible peace. Her navy had been sunk. She had been forbidden to make  war without Roman permission. She had been condemned to pay the Romans  millions of dollars for endless years to come. Life offered no hope of  a better future. In the year 190 B.C. Hannibal took poison and killed  himself.    Forty years later, the Romans forced their last war upon Carthage. Three  long years the inhabitants of the old Phoenician colony held out against  the power of the new republic. Hunger forced them to surrender. The few  men and women who had survived the siege were sold as slaves. The city  was set on fire. For two whole weeks the store-houses and the pal-aces  and the great arsenal burned. Then a terrible curse was pronounced upon  the blackened ruins and the Roman legions returned to Italy to enjoy  their victory.    For the next thousand years, the Mediterranean remained a European sea.  But as soon as the Roman Empire had been destroyed, Asia made another  attempt to dominate this great inland sea, as you will learn when I tell  you about Mohammed.          THE RISE OF ROME    HOW ROME HAPPENED      THE Roman Empire was an accident. No one planned it. It \"happened.\" No  famous general or statesman or cut-throat ever got up and said \"Friends,  Romans, Citizens, we must found an Empire. Follow me and together we  shall conquer all the land from the Gates of Hercules to Mount Taurus.\"    Rome produced famous generals and equally distinguished statesmen and  cut-throats, and Roman armies fought all over the world. But the Roman  empire-making was done without a preconceived plan. The average  Roman was a very matter-of-fact citizen. He disliked theories about  government. When someone began to recite \"eastward the course of Roman  Empire, etc., etc.,\" he hastily left the forum. He just continued to  take more and more land because circumstances forced him to do so. He  was not driven by ambition or by greed. Both by nature and inclination  he was a farmer and wanted to stay at home. But when he was attacked he  was obliged to defend himself and when the enemy happened to cross the  sea to ask for aid in a distant country then the patient Roman marched  many dreary miles to defeat this dangerous foe and when this had been  accomplished, he stayed behind to adminster{sic} his newly conquered  provinces lest they fall into the hands of wandering Barbarians and  become themselves a menace to Roman safety. It sounds rather complicated  and yet to the contemporaries it was so very simple, as you shall see in  a moment.    In the year 203 B.C. Scipio had crossed the African Sea and had carried  the war into Africa. Carthage had called Hannibal back. Badly supported  by his mercenaries, Hannibal had been defeated near Zama. The Romans had  asked for his surrender and Hannibal had fled to get aid from the kings  of Macedonia and Syria, as I told you in my last chapter.    The rulers of these two countries (remnants of the Empire of Alexander  the Great) just then were contemplating an expedition against Egypt.  They hoped to divide the rich Nile valley between themselves. The king  of Egypt had heard of this and he had asked Rome to come to his  support. The stage was set for a number of highly interesting plots and  counter-plots. But the Romans, with their lack of imagination, rang  the curtain down before the play had been fairly started. Their legions  completely defeated the heavy Greek phalanx which was still used by the  Macedonians as their battle formation. That happened in the year 197  B.C. at the battle in the plains of Cynoscephalae, or \"Dogs' Heads,\" in  central Thessaly.    The Romans then marched southward to Attica and informed the Greeks that  they had come to \"deliver the Hellenes from the Macedonian yoke.\" The  Greeks, having learned nothing in their years of semi-slavery, used  their new freedom in a most unfortunate way. All the little city-states  once more began to quarrel with each other as they had done in the good  old days. The Romans, who had little understanding and less love for  these silly bickerings of a race which they rather despised, showed  great forebearance. But tiring of these endless dissensions they lost  patience, invaded Greece, burned down Corinth (to \"encourage the other  Greeks\") and sent a Roman governor to Athens to rule this turbulent  province. In this way, Macedonia and Greece became buffer states which  protected Rome's eastern frontier.    Meanwhile right across the Hellespont lay the Kingdom of Syria, and  Antiochus III, who ruled that vast land, had shown great eagerness when  his distinguished guest, General Hannibal, explained to him how easy it  would be to invade Italy and sack the city of Rome.    Lucius Scipio, a brother of Scipio the African fighter who had defeated  Hannibal and his Carthaginians at Zama, was sent to Asia Minor. He  destroyed the armies of the Syrian king near Magnesia (in the year 190  B.C.) Shortly afterwards, Antiochus was lynched by his own people. Asia  Minor became a Roman protectorate and the small City-Republic of Rome  was mistress of most of the lands which bordered upon the Mediterranean.          THE ROMAN EMPIRE    HOW THE REPUBLIC OF ROME AFTER CENTURIES OF UNREST AND REVOLUTION BECAME  AN EMPIRE      WHEN the Roman armies returned from these many victorious campaigns,  they were received with great jubilation. Alas and alack! this sudden  glory did not make the country any happier. On the contrary. The endless  campaigns had ruined the farmers who had been obliged to do the hard  work of Empire making. It had placed too much power in the hands of the  successful generals (and their private friends) who had used the war as  an excuse for wholesale robbery.    The old Roman Republic had been proud of the simplicity which had  characterised the lives of her famous men. The new Republic felt ashamed  of the shabby coats and the high principles which had been fashionable  in the days of its grandfathers. It became a land of rich people ruled  by rich people for the benefit of rich people. As such it was doomed to  disastrous failure, as I shall now tell you.    Within less than a century and a half. Rome had become the mistress of  practically all the land around the Mediterranean. In those early days  of history a prisoner of war lost his freedom and became a slave. The  Roman regarded war as a very serious business and he showed no mercy to  a conquered foe. After the fall of Carthage, the Carthaginian women and  children were sold into bondage together with their own slaves. And a  like fate awaited the obstinate inhabitants of Greece and Macedonia and  Spain and Syria when they dared to revolt against the Roman power.    Two thousand years ago a slave was merely a piece of machinery. Nowadays  a rich man invests his money in factories. The rich people of Rome  (senators, generals and war-profiteers) invested theirs in land and in  slaves. The land they bought or took in the newly-acquired provinces.  The slaves they bought in open market wherever they happened to be  cheapest. During most of the third and second centuries before Christ  there was a plentiful supply, and as a result the landowners worked  their slaves until they dropped dead in their tracks, when they bought  new ones at the nearest bargain-counter of Corinthian or Carthaginian  captives.    And now behold the fate of the freeborn farmer!    He had done his duty toward Rome and he had fought her battles without  complaint. But when he came home after ten, fifteen or twenty years, his  lands were covered with weeds and his family had been ruined. But he was  a strong man and willing to begin life anew. He sowed and planted and  waited for the harvest. He carried his grain to the market together with  his cattle and his poultry, to find that the large landowners who worked  their estates with slaves could underbid him all along the line. For a  couple of years he tried to hold his own. Then he gave up in despair. He  left the country and he went to the nearest city. In the city he was as  hungry as he had been before on the land. But he shared his misery with  thousands of other disinherited beings. They crouched together in filthy  hovels in the suburbs of the large cities. They were apt to get sick and  die from terrible epidemics. They were all profoundly discontented. They  had fought for their country and this was their reward. They were always  willing to listen to those plausible spell-binders who gather around a  public grievance like so many hungry vultures, and soon they became a  grave menace to the safety of the state.    But the class of the newly-rich shrugged its shoulders. \"We have our  army and our policemen,\" they argued, \"they will keep the mob in order.\"  And they hid themselves behind the high walls of their pleasant villas  and cultivated their gardens and read the poems of a certain Homer which  a Greek slave had just translated into very pleasing Latin hexameters.    In a few families however the old tradition of unselfish service to the  Commonwealth continued. Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus,  had been married to a Roman by the name of Gracchus. She had two sons,  Tiberius and Gaius. When the boys grew up they entered politics and  tried to bring about certain much-needed reforms. A census had shown  that most of the land of the Italian peninsula was owned by two thousand  noble families. Tiberius Gracchus, having been elected a Tribune, tried  to help the freemen. He revived two ancient laws which restricted the  number of acres which a single owner might possess. In this way he hoped  to revive the valuable old "]]]
