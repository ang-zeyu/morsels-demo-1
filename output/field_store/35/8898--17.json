Saints are they, if in this age any may merit so high a name.\"    \"I count them not a fly,\" cried Hordle John; \"for who is the better for  all their whipping and yowling? They are like other friars, I trow, when  all is done. Let them leave their backs alone, and beat the pride out of  their hearts.\"    \"By the three kings! there is sooth in what you say,\" remarked the  archer. \"Besides, methinks if I were le bon Dieu, it would bring me  little joy to see a poor devil cutting the flesh off his bones; and I  should think that he had but a small opinion of me, that he should hope  to please me by such provost-marshal work. No, by my hilt! I should look  with a more loving eye upon a jolly archer who never harmed a fallen foe  and never feared a hale one.\"    \"Doubtless you mean no sin,\" said Alleyne. \"If your words are wild, it  is not for me to judge them. Can you not see that there are other foes  in this world besides Frenchmen, and as much glory to be gained in  conquering them? Would it not be a proud day for knight or squire if he  could overthrow seven adversaries in the lists? Yet here are we in the  lists of life, and there come the seven black champions against us Sir  Pride, Sir Covetousness, Sir Lust, Sir Anger, Sir Gluttony, Sir Envy,  and Sir Sloth. Let a man lay those seven low, and he shall have the  prize of the day, from the hands of the fairest queen of beauty, even  from the Virgin-Mother herself. It is for this that these men mortify  their flesh, and to set us an example, who would pamper ourselves  overmuch. I say again that they are God's own saints, and I bow my head  to them.\"    \"And so you shall, mon petit,\" replied the archer. \"I have not heard  a man speak better since old Dom Bertrand died, who was at one time  chaplain to the White Company. He was a very valiant man, but at  the battle of Brignais he was spitted through the body by a Hainault  man-at-arms. For this we had an excommunication read against the man,  when next we saw our holy father at Avignon; but as we had not his name,  and knew nothing of him, save that he rode a dapple-gray roussin, I have  feared sometimes that the blight may have settled upon the wrong man.\"    \"Your Company has been, then, to bow knee before our holy father, the  Pope Urban, the prop and centre of Christendom?\" asked Alleyne, much  interested. \"Perchance you have yourself set eyes upon his august face?\"    \"Twice I saw him,\" said the archer. \"He was a lean little rat of a man,  with a scab on his chin. The first time we had five thousand crowns out  of him, though he made much ado about it. The second time we asked ten  thousand, but it was three days before we could come to terms, and I  am of opinion myself that we might have done better by plundering the  palace. His chamberlain and cardinals came forth, as I remember, to  ask whether we would take seven thousand crowns with his blessing and  a plenary absolution, or the ten thousand with his solemn ban by bell,  book and candle. We were all of one mind that it was best to have the  ten thousand with the curse; but in some way they prevailed upon Sir  John, so that we were blest and shriven against our will. Perchance it  is as well, for the Company were in need of it about that time.\"    The pious Alleyne was deeply shocked by this reminiscence. Involuntarily  he glanced up and around to see if there were any trace of those  opportune levin-flashes and thunderbolts which, in the \"Acta Sanctorum,\"  were wont so often to cut short the loose talk of the scoffer. The  autumn sun streamed down as brightly as ever, and the peaceful red path  still wound in front of them through the rustling, yellow-tinted forest,  Nature seemed to be too busy with her own concerns to heed the dignity  of an outraged pontiff. Yet he felt a sense of weight and reproach  within his breast, as though he had sinned himself in giving ear to such  words. The teachings of twenty years cried out against such license. It  was not until he had thrown himself down before one of the many wayside  crosses, and had prayed from his heart both for the archer and for  himself, that the dark cloud rolled back again from his spirit.        CHAPTER VIII. THE THREE FRIENDS.      His companions had passed on whilst he was at his orisons; but his young  blood and the fresh morning air both invited him to a scamper. His staff  in one hand and his scrip in the other, with springy step and floating  locks, he raced along the forest path, as active and as graceful as a  young deer. He had not far to go, however; for, on turning a corner,  he came on a roadside cottage with a wooden fence-work around it, where  stood big John and Aylward the bowman, staring at something within. As  he came up with them, he saw that two little lads, the one about nine  years of age and the other somewhat older, were standing on the plot  in front of the cottage, each holding out a round stick in their left  hands, with their arms stiff and straight from the shoulder, as  silent and still as two small statues. They were pretty, blue-eyed,  yellow-haired lads, well made and sturdy, with bronzed skins, which  spoke of a woodland life.    \"Here are young chips from an old bow stave!\" cried the soldier in great  delight. \"This is the proper way to raise children. By my hilt! I could  not have trained them better had I the ordering of it myself.\"    \"What is it then?\" asked Hordle John. \"They stand very stiff, and I  trust that they have not been struck so.\"    \"Nay, they are training their left arms, that they may have a steady  grasp of the bow. So my own father trained me, and six days a week I  held out his walking-staff till my arm was heavy as lead. Hola, mes  enfants! how long will you hold out?\"    \"Until the sun is over the great lime-tree, good master,\" the elder  answered.    \"What would ye be, then? Woodmen? Verderers?\"    \"Nay, soldiers,\" they cried both together.    \"By the beard of my father! but ye are whelps of the true breed. Why so  keen, then, to be soldiers?\"    \"That we may fight the Scots,\" they answered. \"Daddy will send us to  fight the Scots.\"    \"And why the Scots, my pretty lads? We have seen French and Spanish  galleys no further away than Southampton, but I doubt that it will be  some time before the Scots find their way to these parts.\"    \"Our business is with the Scots,\" quoth the elder; \"for it was the Scots  who cut off daddy's string fingers and his thumbs.\"    \"Aye, lads, it was that,\" said a deep voice from behind Alleyne's  shoulder. Looking round, the wayfarers saw a gaunt, big-boned man, with  sunken cheeks and a sallow face, who had come up behind them. He held  up his two hands as he spoke, and showed that the thumbs and two first  fingers had been torn away from each of them.    \"Ma foi, camarade!\" cried Aylward. \"Who hath served thee in so shameful  a fashion?\"    \"It is easy to see, friend, that you were born far from the marches of  Scotland,\" quoth the stranger, with a bitter smile. \"North of Humber  there is no man who would not know the handiwork of Devil Douglas, the  black Lord James.\"    \"And how fell you into his hands?\" asked John.    \"I am a man of the north country, from the town of Beverley and the  wapentake of Holderness,\" he answered. \"There was a day when, from Trent  to Tweed, there was no better marksman than Robin Heathcot. Yet, as you  see, he hath left me, as he hath left many another poor border archer,  with no grip for bill or bow. Yet the king hath given me a living here  in the southlands, and please God these two lads of mine will pay off  a debt that hath been owing over long. What is the price of daddy's  thumbs, boys?\"    \"Twenty Scottish lives,\" they answered together.    \"And for the fingers?\"    \"Half a score.\"    \"When they can bend my war-bow, and bring down a squirrel at a hundred  paces, I send them to take service under Johnny Copeland, the Lord of  the Marches and Governor of Carlisle. By my soul! I would give the rest  of my fingers to see the Douglas within arrow-flight of them.\"    \"May you live to see it,\" quoth the bowman. \"And hark ye, mes enfants,  take an old soldier's rede and lay your bodies to the bow, drawing from  hip and thigh as much as from arm. Learn also, I pray you, to shoot with  a dropping shaft; for though a bowman may at times be called upon to  shoot straight and fast, yet it is more often that he has to do with a  town-guard behind a wall, or an arbalestier with his mantlet raised when  you cannot hope to do him scathe unless your shaft fall straight upon  him from the clouds. I have not drawn string for two weeks, but I may  be able to show ye how such shots should be made.\" He loosened his  long-bow, slung his quiver round to the front, and then glanced keenly  round for a fitting mark. There was a yellow and withered stump some  way off, seen under the drooping branches of a lofty oak. The archer  measured the distance with his eye; and then, drawing three shafts, he  shot them off with such speed that the first had not reached the mark  ere the last was on the string. Each arrow passed high over the oak;  and, of the three, two stuck fair into the stump; while the third,  caught in some wandering puff of wind, was driven a foot or two to one  side.    \"Good!\" cried the north countryman. \"Hearken to him lads! He is a master  bowman. Your dad says amen to every word he says.\"    \"By my hilt!\" said Aylward, \"if I am to preach on bowmanship, the whole  long day would scarce give me time for my sermon. We have marksmen in  the Company who will notch with a shaft every crevice and joint of a  man-at-arm's harness, from the clasp of his bassinet to the hinge of his  greave. But, with your favor, friend, I must gather my arrows again, for  while a shaft costs a penny a poor man can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#15)"],[1,"enjoined the police to have an eye on the students, to note their conduct  and what company they kept. They were not to become members of prohibited  societies, not to go too often to the theatre, nor to waste their time in  raking and feastings. If their conduct became too outrageous, they were to  be beaten with rods and sent back to their parents. At Carthage there was  a hard-living set of men who called themselves \"The Wreckers.\" Their great  pleasure was to go and make a row at a professor's lecture; they would  burst noisily into the classroom and smash up anything they could lay hold  of. They amused themselves also by \"ragging\" the freshmen, jeering at their  simplicity, and playing them a thousand tricks. Things haven't much changed  since then. The fellow-students of Augustin were so like students of  to-day that the most modern terms suggest themselves to describe their  performances.    Augustin, who was on the whole well conducted, and, as behoved a future  professor, had a respect for discipline, disapproved of \"The Wreckers\" and  their violence. This did not prevent him from enjoying himself in their  society. He was overcome with shame because he could not keep pace with  them--we must believe it at least, since he tells us so himself. With a  certain lack of assurance, blended however with much juvenile vanity, he  joined the band. He listened to that counsel of vulgar wisdom which is  disastrous to souls like his: \"Do as others do.\" He accordingly did do  as the others; he knew all their debauchery, or he imagined he did, for  however low he went, he was never able to do anything mean. He was then so  far from the faith that he arranged love-trysts in the churches. \"I was not  afraid to think of my lust, and plan a scheme for securing the deadly fruit  of sin, even within the walls of Thy church during the celebration of Thy  mysteries.\" We might be reading the confession of a sensualist of to-day.  One grows astonished at these morals, at once so old and so modern. What,  already! These young Christian basilicas, but newly sprung out of the  earth, where the men were strictly separated from the women--were they  already become places of assignation, where love-letters were slipped into  hands, and procuresses sold their furtive services!...    At length the great happiness for which Augustin had so long been sighing  was granted him: he loved and he was loved.    He loved as he indeed was able to love, with all the impetuosity of his  nature and all the fire of his temperament, with all his heart and all his  senses. \"I plunged headlong into love, whose fetters I longed to wear.\" But  as he went at once to extremes, as he meant to give himself altogether,  and expected all in return, he grew irritated at not receiving this same  kind of love. It was never enough love for him. Yet he was loved, and the  very certainty of this love, always too poor to his mind, exasperated the  violence and pertinacity of his desire. \"Because I was loved, I proudly  riveted round myself the chain of woe, to be soon scourged with the red-hot  iron rods of jealousy, torn by suspicions, fears, anger, and quarrels.\"  This was passion with chorus and orchestra, a little theatrical, with its  violences, its alternations between fury and ecstasy, such as an African,  steeped in romantic literature, would conceive it. Deceived, he flung  himself in desperate pursuit of the ever-flitting love. He had certainly  more than one passion. Each one left him more hungry than the last.    He was sensual, and he felt each time how brief is pleasure, in what a  limited circle all enjoyment turns. He was tender, eager to give himself;  and he saw plainly that one never gives oneself quite altogether, that even  in the maddest hours of surrender one always reserves oneself in secret,  keeping for oneself something of oneself; and he felt that most of the time  his tenderness got no answer. When the joyous heart brings the offering of  its love, the heart of her he loves is absent. And when it is there, on the  edge of the lips, decked and smiling to meet the loved one, it is the other  who is absent. Almost never do they join together, and they never join  together altogether. And so this Love, which claims to be constant and even  eternal, ought to be, if it would prolong itself, a continual act of faith,  and hope, and charity. To believe in it in spite of its darkening and  falling away; to hope its return, often against all evidence; to pardon its  injustices and sometimes its foul actions--how many are capable of such  abnegation? Augustin went through all that. He was in despair about it.  And then, the nostalgia of predestined souls took hold of him. He had an  indistinct feeling that these human loves were unworthy of him, and that  if he must have a master, he was born to serve another Master. He had a  desire to shake off the platitude of here below, the melancholy fen where  stagnated what he calls \"the marsh of the flesh\"; to escape, in a word,  from the wretched huts wherein for a little he had sheltered his heart; to  burn all behind him, and so prevent the weakness of a return; and to go and  pitch his tent further, higher, he knew not where--upon some unapproachable  mountain where the air is icy, but before the eyes, the vasty stretches of  light and space....    These first loves of Augustin were really too fierce to last. They  burned up themselves. Augustin did not keep them up long. There was in  him, besides, an instinct which counteracted his exuberant, amorous  sentimentality--the sense of beauty. That in itself was enough to make him  pause on the downhill of riot. The anarchy and commotion of passion was  repellent to a mind devoted to clearness and order. But there was still  another thing--the son of the Thagaste freeholder had any amount of common  sense. That at least was left to him of the paternal heritage. A youth of  what we call the lower middle class, strictly brought up in the hard and  frugal discipline of the provinces, he felt the effects of his training.  The bohemianism in which his friends revelled could not hold him  indefinitely. Besides this, the career he desired, that of a barrister  or professor, had a preliminary obligation to maintain a certain outward  decorum. He himself tells us so; in the midst of his most disreputable  performances he aspired to be known for his fashion and wit--_elegans atque  urbanus_. Politeness of speech and manners, the courteous mutual deference  of the best society--such, was the ideal of this budding professor of  rhetoric.    Anxiety about his future, joined to his rapid disenchantments, ere long  sobered the student: he just took his fling and then settled down. Love  turned for him into sensual habit. His head became clear for study and  meditation. The apprentice to rhetoric liked his business. Up to his  last breath, despite his efforts to change, he continued, like all his  contemporaries, to love rhetoric. He handled words like a worker in verbals  who is aware of their price and knows all their resources. Even after his  conversion, if he condemns profane literature as a poisoner of souls, he  absolves the beauty of language. \"I accuse not words,\" he says. \"Words  are choice and precious vessels. I accuse the wine of error that drunken  doctors pour out for us into these fair goblets.\" At the Rhetoric School he  took extreme pleasure in declaiming. He was applauded; the professor gave  him as an example to the others. These scholastic triumphs foretold others  more celebrated and reverberating. And so, in his heart, literary vanity  and ambition disputed the ever-lively illusions of love. And then, above  all! he had to live; Monnica's remittances were necessarily small; the  generosity of Romanianus had its limit. So he beat about to enlarge his  small student's purse. He wrote verses for poetic competitions. Perhaps  already he was able to act as tutor to certain of his fellow-students, less  advanced.    If the need of loving tormented his sentimental heart, he tried to assuage  it in friendship. He loved friendship as he loved love. He was a passionate  and faithful friend up to his death. At this time of his life, he was  riveting friendships which were never to be broken. He had beside him his  fellow-countryman, Alypius, the future Bishop of Thagaste, who had followed  him to Carthage and would, later on, follow him to Milan; Nebridius, a not  less dear companion, fated to die early; Honoratus, whom he drew into his  errors and later did his best to enlighten; and, finally, that mysterious  young man, whose name he does not tell us, and whose loss he mourned as  never any one has mourned the death of a friend.    They lived in daily and hourly intimacy, in continual fervour and  enthusiasm. They were great theatre-goers, where Augustin was able to  satisfy his desire for tender emotions and romantic adventures. They had  musical parties; they tried over again the popular airs heard at the  Odeum or some other of the innumerable theatres at Carthage. All the  Carthaginians, even the populace, were mad about music. The Bishop of  Hippo, in his sermons, recalls a mason upon his scaffolding, or a shoemaker  in his stall, singing away the tunes of well-known musicians. Then our  students strolled on the quays or in the Harbour Square, contemplating  the many-coloured sea, this splendour of waters at the setting sun, which  Augustin will extol one day with an inspiration unknown to the ancient  poets. Above all, they fell into discussions, commented what they had  lately read, or built up astonishing plans for the future. So flowed by a  happy and charming life, abruptly interpolated with superb anticipations.  With what a full heart the Christian penitent calls it back for us!--\"What  delighted me in the intercourse of my friends, was the talk, the laughter,  the good turns we did each other, the common study of the masters of"]]]
