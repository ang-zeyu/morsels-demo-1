Then the cook came to call them to dinner, and they found an inviting  meal prepared for them.  The Lord High Chigglewitz sat at the head of  the table and Grandmother Gnit at the foot, and the guests had a merry  time and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.    After dinner they went out into the yard and matched several other  people together, and this work was so interesting that they might have  spent the entire day at Fuddlecumjig had not the Wizard suggested that  they resume their journey.    \"But I don't like to leave all these poor people scattered,\" said  Dorothy, undecided what to do.    \"Oh, don't mind us, my dear,\" returned old Larry.  \"Every day or so  some of the Gillikins, or Munchkins, or Winkies come here to amuse  themselves by matching us together, so there will be no harm in leaving  these pieces where they are for a time.  But I hope you will visit us  again, and if you do you will always be welcome, I assure you.\"    \"Don't you ever match each other?\" she inquired.    \"Never; for we are no puzzles to ourselves, and so there wouldn't be  any fun in it.\"    They now said goodbye to the queer Fuddles and got into their wagon to  continue their journey.    \"Those are certainly strange people,\" remarked Aunt Em, thoughtfully,  as they drove away from Fuddlecumjig, \"but I really can't see what use  they are, at all.\"    \"Why, they amused us all for several hours,\" replied the Wizard.  \"That  is being of use to us, I'm sure.\"    \"I think they're more fun than playing solitaire or mumbletypeg,\"  declared Uncle Henry, soberly.  \"For my part, I'm glad we visited the  Fuddles.\"        13.  How the General Talked to the King    When General Guph returned to the cavern of the Nome King his Majesty  asked:    \"Well, what luck?  Will the Whimsies join us?\"    \"They will,\" answered the General.  \"They will fight for us with all  their strength and cunning.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed the King.  \"What reward did you promise them?\"    \"Your Majesty is to use the Magic Belt to give each Whimsie a large,  fine head, in place of the small one he is now obliged to wear.\"    \"I agree to that,\" said the King.  \"This is good news, Guph, and it  makes me feel more certain of the conquest of Oz.\"    \"But I have other news for you,\" announced the General.    \"Good or bad?\"    \"Good, your Majesty.\"    \"Then I will hear it,\" said the King, with interest.    \"The Growleywogs will join us.\"    \"No!\" cried the astonished King.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said the General.  \"I have their promise.\"    \"But what reward do they demand?\" inquired the King, suspiciously, for  he knew how greedy the Growleywogs were.    \"They are to take a few of the Oz people for their slaves,\" replied  Guph.  He did not think it necessary to tell Roquat that the  Growleywogs demanded twenty thousand slaves.  It would be time enough  for that when Oz was conquered.    \"A very reasonable request, I'm sure,\" remarked the King.  \"I must  congratulate you, Guph, upon the wonderful success of your journey.\"    \"But that is not all,\" said the General, proudly.    The King seemed astonished.  \"Speak out, sir!\" he commanded.    \"I have seen the First and Foremost Phanfasm of the Mountain of  Phantastico, and he will bring his people to assist us.\"    \"What!\" cried the King.  \"The Phanfasms!  You don't mean it, Guph!\"    \"It is true,\" declared the General, proudly.    The King became thoughtful, and his brows wrinkled.    \"I'm afraid, Guph,\" he said rather anxiously, \"that the First and  Foremost may prove as dangerous to us as to the Oz people.  If he and  his terrible band come down from the mountain they may take the notion  to conquer the Nomes!\"    \"Pah!  That is a foolish idea,\" retorted Guph, irritably, but he knew  in his heart that the King was right.  \"The First and Foremost is a  particular friend of mine, and will do us no harm.  Why, when I was  there, he even invited me into his house.\"    The General neglected to tell the King how he had been jerked into the  hut of the First and Foremost by means of the brass hoop.  So Roquat  the Red looked at his General admiringly and said:    \"You are a wonderful Nome, Guph.  I'm sorry I did not make you my  General before.  But what reward did the First and Foremost demand?\"    \"Nothing at all,\" answered Guph.  \"Even the Magic Belt itself could not  add to his powers of sorcery.  All the Phanfasms wish is to destroy the  Oz people, who are good and happy.  This pleasure will amply repay them  for assisting us.\"    \"When will they come?\" asked Roquat, half fearfully.    \"When the tunnel is completed,\" said the General.    \"We are nearly halfway under the desert now,\" announced the King; \"and  that is fast work, because the tunnel has to be drilled through solid  rock.  But after we have passed the desert it will not take us long to  extend the tunnel to the walls of the Emerald City.\"    \"Well, whenever you are ready, we shall be joined by the Whimsies, the  Growleywogs and the Phanfasms,\" said Guph; \"so the conquest of Oz is  assured without a doubt.\"    Again, the King seemed thoughtful.    \"I'm almost sorry we did not undertake the conquest alone,\" said he.  \"All of these allies are dangerous people, and they may demand more  than you have promised them.  It might have been better to have  conquered Oz without any outside assistance.\"    \"We could not do it,\" said the General, positively.    \"Why not, Guph?\"    \"You know very well.  You have had one experience with the Oz people,  and they defeated you.\"    \"That was because they rolled eggs at us,\" replied the King, with a  shudder.  \"My Nomes cannot stand eggs, any more than I can myself.  They are poison to all who live underground.\"    \"That is true enough,\" agreed Guph.    \"But we might have taken the Oz people by surprise, and conquered them  before they had a chance to get any eggs.  Our former defeat was due to  the fact that the girl Dorothy had a Yellow Hen with her.  I do not  know what ever became of that hen, but I believe there are no hens at  all in the Land of Oz, and so there could be no eggs there.\"    \"On the contrary,\" said Guph, \"there are now hundreds of chickens in  Oz, and they lay heaps of those dangerous eggs.  I met a goshawk on my  way home, and the bird informed me that he had lately been to Oz to  capture and devour some of the young chickens.  But they are protected  by magic, so the hawk did not get a single one of them.\"    \"That is a very bad report,\" said the King, nervously.  \"Very bad,  indeed.  My Nomes are willing to fight, but they simply can't face  hen's eggs--and I don't blame them.\"    \"They won't need to face them,\" replied Guph.  \"I'm afraid of eggs  myself, and don't propose to take any chances of being poisoned by  them.  My plan is to send the Whimsies through the tunnel first, and  then the Growleywogs and the Phanfasms.  By the time we Nomes get there  the eggs will all be used up, and we may then pursue and capture the  inhabitants at our leisure.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" returned the King, with a dismal sigh.  \"But I  want it distinctly understood that I claim Ozma and Dorothy as my own  prisoners.  They are rather nice girls, and I do not intend to let any  of those dreadful creatures hurt them, or make them their slaves.  When  I have captured them I will bring them here and transform them into  china ornaments to stand on my mantle.  They will look very  pretty--Dorothy on one end of the mantle and Ozma on the other--and I  shall take great care to see they are not broken when the maids dust  them.\"    \"Very well, your Majesty.  Do what you will with the girls for all I  care.  Now that our plans are arranged, and we have the three most  powerful bands of evil spirits in the world to assist us, let us make  haste to get the tunnel finished as soon as possible.\"    \"It will be ready in three days,\" promised the King, and hurried away  to inspect the work and see that the Nomes kept busy.        14.  How the Wizard Practiced Sorcery    \"Where next?\" asked the Wizard when they had left the town of  Fuddlecumjig and the Sawhorse had started back along the road.    \"Why, Ozma laid out this trip,\" replied Dorothy, \"and she 'vised us to  see the Rigmaroles next, and then visit the Tin Woodman.\"    \"That sounds good,\" said the Wizard.  \"But what road do we take to get  to the Rigmaroles?\"    \"I don't know, 'zactly,\" returned the little girl; \"but it must be  somewhere just southwest from here.\"    \"Then why need we go way back to the crossroads?\" asked the Shaggy Man.  \"We might save a lot of time by branching off here.\"    \"There isn't any path,\" asserted Uncle Henry.    \"Then we'd better go back to the signposts, and make sure of our way,\"  decided Dorothy.    But after they had gone a short distance farther the Sawhorse, who had  overheard their conversation, stopped and said:    \"Here is a path.\"    Sure enough, a dim path seemed to branch off from the road they were  on, and it led across pretty green meadows and past leafy groves,  straight toward the southwest.    \"That looks like a good path,\" said Omby Amby.  \"Why not try it?\"    \"All right,\" answered Dorothy.  \"I'm anxious to see what the Rigmaroles  are like, and this path ought to take us there the quickest way.\"    No one made any objection to this plan, so the Sawhorse turned into the  path, which proved to be nearly as good as the one they had taken to  get to the Fuddles.  As first they passed a few retired farm houses,  but soon these scattered dwellings were left behind and only the  meadows and the trees were before them.  But they rode along in  cheerful contentment, and Aunt Em got into an argument with Billina  about the proper way to raise chickens.    \"I do not care to contradict you,\" said the Yellow Hen, with dignity,  \"but I have an idea I know more about chickens than human beings do.\"    \"Pshaw!\" replied Aunt Em.  \"I've"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#15)"],[1,"his disciples firmly adhering to  Hinayanism without knowing that it was a modified and imperfect  doctrine, he had to lead them up to a higher and perfect doctrine  that he might lead them up to Buddhahood.  With this object in view  Shakya Muni preached Vimalakirtti-nirdeca-sutra[FN#117],  Lankavatara-sutra, and other sutras, in which he compared Hinayanism  with Mahayanism, and described the latter in glowing terms as a deep  and perfect Law, whilst he set forth the former at naught as a  superficial and imperfect one.  Thus he showed his disciples the  inferiority of Hinayanism, and caused them to desire for Mahayanism.  This is said to be the third period, which lasted some eight years.      [FN#117]  This is one of the most noted Mahayana books, and is said  to be the best specimen of the sutras belonging to this period.  It  is in this sutra that most of Shakya's eminent disciples, known as  the adherents of Hinayanism, are astonished with the profound wisdom,  the eloquent speech, and the supernatural power of Vimalakirtti, a  Bodhisattva, and confess the inferiority of their faith.  The author  frequently introduces episodes in order to condemn Hinayanism, making  use of miracles of his own invention.      The disciples of the Buddha now understood that Mahayanism was far  superior to Hinayanism, but they thought the higher doctrine was only  for Bodhisattvas and beyond their understanding.  Therefore they  still adhered to the modified doctrine, though they did no longer  decry Mahayanism, which they had no mind to practise.  Upon this  Shakya Muni preached Prajnyaparamita-sutras[FN#118] in the sixteen  assemblies held at four different places, and taught them Mahayanism  in detail in order to cause them to believe it and practise it.  Thus  they became aware that there was no definite demarcation between  Mahayanism and Hinayanism, and that they might become Mahayanists.  This is the fourth period, which lasted about twenty-two years.  Now, the Buddha, aged seventy-two, thought it was high time to preach  his long-cherished doctrine that all sentient beings can attain to  Supreme Enlightenment; so he preached Saddharma-pundarika-sutra, in  which he prophesied when and where his disciples should become  Buddhas.  It was his greatest object to cause all sentient beings to  be Enlightened and enable them to enjoy the bliss of Nirvana.  It was  for this that he had endured great pain and hardships through his  previous existences.  It was for this that he had left his heavenly  abode to appear on earth.  It was for this that he had preached from  time to time through his long career of forty-seven years.  Having  thus realized his great aim, Shakya Muni had now to prepare for his  final departure, and preached Mahaparinirvana-sutra in order to show  that all the animated and inanimate things were endowed with the same  nature as his.  After this last instruction he passed to eternity.  This is called the fifth period, which lasted some eight years.      [FN#118]  Nagarjuna's doctrine depends mainly on these sutras.      These five periods above mentioned can scarcely be called historical  in the proper sense of the term, yet they are ingeniously invented by  Ten Dai Dai Shi to set the Buddhist Scriptures in the order of  doctrinal development, and place Saddharma-pundarika in the highest  rank among the Mahayana books.  His argument, however dogmatic and  anti-historical in no small degree, would be not a little valuable  for our reader, who wants to know the general phase of the Buddhist  Canon, consisting of thousands of fascicles.        4. Sutras used by Zen Masters.    Ten Dai failed to explain away the discrepancies and contradictions  of which the Canon is full, and often contradicted himself by the  ignoring of historical[FN#119] facts.      [FN#119]  Let us state our own opinion on the subject in question.  The foundation of Hinayanism consists in the four Nikayas, or four  Agamas, the most important books of that school.  Besides the four  Agamas, there exist in the Chinese Tripitaka numerous books  translated by various authors, some of which are extracts from  Agamas, and some the lives of the Buddha, while others are entirely  different sutras, apparently of later date.  Judging from these  sources, it seems to us that most of Shakya Muni's original teachings  are embodied into the four Agamas.  But it is still a matter of  uncertainty that whether they are stated in Agamas now extant just as  they were, for the Buddha's preachings were rehearsed immediately  after the Buddha's death in the first council held at Rajagrha, yet  not consigned to writing.  They were handed down by memory about one  hundred years.  Then the monks at Vaisali committed the so-called Ten  Indulgences, infringing the rules of the Order, and maintained that  Shakya Muni had not condemned them in his preachings.  As there were,  however, no written sutras to disprove their assertion, the elders,  such as Yaca, Revata, and others, who opposed the Indulgences, had to  convoke the second council of 700 monks, in which they succeeded in  getting the Indulgences condemned, and rehearsed the Buddha's  instruction for the second time.  Even in this council of Vaisali we  cannot find the fact that the Master's preachings were reduced to  writing.  The decisions of the 700 elders were not accepted by the  party of opposition, who held a separate council, and settled their  own rules and doctrine.  Thus the same doctrine of the Teacher began  to be differently stated and believed.    This being the first open schism, one disruption after another took  place among the Buddhistic Order.  There were many different schools  of the Buddhists at the time when King Acoka ascended the throne  (about 269 B.C.), and the patronage of the King drew a great number  of pagan ascetics into the Order, who, though they dressed themselves  in the yellow robes, yet still preserved their religious views in  their original colour.  This naturally led the Church into continual  disturbances and moral corruption.  In the eighteenth year of Acoka's  reign the King summoned the council of 1,000 monks at Pataliputra  (Patna), and settled the orthodox doctrine in order to keep the  Dharma pure from heretical beliefs.  We believe that about this time  some of the Buddha's preachings were reduced to writing, for the  missionaries despatched by the King in the year following the council  seem to have set out with written sutras.  In addition to this, some  of the names of the passages of the Dharma are given in the Bharbra  edict of the King, which was addressed to the monks in Magadha.  We  do not suppose, however, that all the sutras were written at once in  these days, but that they were copied down from memory one after  another at different times, because some of the sutras were put down  in Ceylon 160 years after the Council of Patna.    In the introductory book of Ekottaragama (Anguttara Nikaya), now  extant in the Chinese Tripitaka, we notice the following points: (1)  It is written in a style quite different from that of the original  Agama, but similar to that of the supplementary books of the Mahayana  sutras; (2) it states Ananda's compilation of the Tripitaka after the  death of the Master; (3) it refers to the past Buddhas, the future  Buddha Maitreya, and innumerable Bodhisattvas; (4) it praises the  profound doctrine of Mahayanism.  From this we infer that the Agama  was put in the present form after the rise of the Mahayana School,  and handed down through the hand of Mahasanghika scholars, who were  much in sympathy with Mahayanism.    Again, the first book of Dirghagama, (Digha Nikaya), that describes  the line of Buddhas who appeared before Shakya Muni, adopts the whole  legend of Gotama's life as a common mode of all Buddhas appearing on  earth; while the second book narrates the death of Gotama and the  distribution of his relies, and refers to Pataliputra, the new  capital of Acoka.  This shows us that the present Agama is not of an  earlier date than the third century B.C. Samyuktagama (Samyutta  Nikaya) also gives a detailed account of Acoka's conversion, and of  his father Bindusara.  From these evidences we may safely infer that  the Hinayana sutras were put in the present shape at different times  between the third century B.C. and the first century A.D.  With regard to the Mahayana sutras we have little doubt about their  being the writings of the later Buddhist reformers, even if they are  put in the mouth of Shakya Muni.  They are entirely different from  the sutras of Hinayanism, and cannot be taken as the preachings of  one and the same person.  The reader should notice the following  points:    (1) Four councils were held for the rehearsal of the Tripitaka  namely, the first at Rajagrha, in the year of Shakya Muni's death;  the second at Vaisali, some 100 years after the Buddha; the third at  the time of King Acoka, about 235 years after the Master; the fourth  at the time of King Kanishka, the first century A.D.  But all these  councils were held to compile the Hinayana sutras, and nothing is  known of the rehearsal of the Mahayana books.  Some are of opinion  that the first council was held within the Sattapanni cave, near  Rajagrha, where the Hinayana Tripitaka was rehearsed by 500 monks,  while outside the cave there assembled a greater number of monks, who  were not admitted into the cave, and rehearsed the Mahayana  Tripitaka.  This opinion, however, is based on no reliable source.    (2) The Indian orthodox Buddhists of old declared that the Mahayana  sutras were the fabrication of heretics or of the Evil One, and not  the teachings of the Buddha.  In reply to this, the Mahayanists had  to prove that the Mahayana sutras were compiled by the direct  disciples of the Master; but even Nagarjuna could not vindicate the  compilation of the doubtful books, and said (in  Mahaprajnyaparamita-castra) that they were"]]]
