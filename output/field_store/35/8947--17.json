Even now, were he set upon the  ground, the chance was remote, he knew, that he could find his way back  to the village of Mbonga, the chief.  Even if he could, there were the  lions and the leopards and the hyenas, any one of which, as Tibo was  well aware, was particularly fond of the meat of little black boys.    So far the terrible white god of the jungle had offered him no harm.  He could not expect even this much consideration from the frightful,  green-eyed man-eaters.  It would be the lesser of two evils, then, to  let the white god carry him away without scratching and biting, as he  had done at first.    As Tarzan swung rapidly through the trees, little Tibo closed his eyes  in terror rather than look longer down into the frightful abysses  beneath.  Never before in all his life had Tibo been so frightened, yet  as the white giant sped on with him through the forest there stole over  the child an inexplicable sensation of security as he saw how true were  the leaps of the ape-man, how unerring his grasp upon the swaying limbs  which gave him hand-hold, and then, too, there was safety in the middle  terraces of the forest, far above the reach of the dreaded lions.    And so Tarzan came to the clearing where the tribe fed, dropping among  them with his new balu clinging tightly to his shoulders.  He was  fairly in the midst of them before Tibo spied a single one of the great  hairy forms, or before the apes realized that Tarzan was not alone.  When they saw the little Gomangani perched upon his back some of them  came forward in curiosity with upcurled lips and snarling mien.    An hour before little Tibo would have said that he knew the uttermost  depths of fear; but now, as he saw these fearsome beasts surrounding  him, he realized that all that had gone before was as nothing by  comparison.  Why did the great white giant stand there so  unconcernedly?  Why did he not flee before these horrid, hairy, tree  men fell upon them both and tore them to pieces? And then there came to  Tibo a numbing recollection.  It was none other than the story he had  heard passed from mouth to mouth, fearfully, by the people of Mbonga,  the chief, that this great white demon of the jungle was naught other  than a hairless ape, for had not he been seen in company with these?    Tibo could only stare in wide-eyed horror at the approaching apes.  He  saw their beetling brows, their great fangs, their wicked eyes.  He  noted their mighty muscles rolling beneath their shaggy hides.  Their  every attitude and expression was a menace.  Tarzan saw this, too.  He  drew Tibo around in front of him.    \"This is Tarzan's Go-bu-balu,\" he said.  \"Do not harm him, or Tarzan  will kill you,\" and he bared his own fangs in the teeth of the nearest  ape.    \"It is a Gomangani,\" replied the ape.  \"Let me kill it.  It is a  Gomangani.  The Gomangani are our enemies.  Let me kill it.\"    \"Go away,\" snarled Tarzan.  \"I tell you, Gunto, it is Tarzan's balu.  Go away or Tarzan will kill you,\" and the ape-man took a step toward  the advancing ape.    The latter sidled off, quite stiff and haughty, after the manner of a  dog which meets another and is too proud to fight and too fearful to  turn his back and run.    Next came Teeka, prompted by curiosity.  At her side skipped little  Gazan.  They were filled with wonder like the others; but Teeka did not  bare her fangs.  Tarzan saw this and motioned that she approach.    \"Tarzan has a balu now,\" he said.  \"He and Teeka's balu can play  together.\"    \"It is a Gomangani,\" replied Teeka.  \"It will kill my balu.  Take it  away, Tarzan.\"    Tarzan laughed.  \"It could not harm Pamba, the rat,\" he said.  \"It is  but a little balu and very frightened.  Let Gazan play with it.\"    Teeka still was fearful, for with all their mighty ferocity the great  anthropoids are timid; but at last, assured by her great confidence in  Tarzan, she pushed Gazan forward toward the little black boy.  The  small ape, guided by instinct, drew back toward its mother, baring its  small fangs and screaming in mingled fear and rage.    Tibo, too, showed no signs of desiring a closer acquaintance with  Gazan, so Tarzan gave up his efforts for the time.    During the week which followed, Tarzan found his time much occupied.  His balu was a greater responsibility than he had counted upon.  Not  for a moment did he dare leave it, since of all the tribe, Teeka alone  could have been depended upon to refrain from slaying the hapless black  had it not been for Tarzan's constant watchfulness.  When the ape-man  hunted, he must carry Go-bu-balu about with him.  It was irksome, and  then the little black seemed so stupid and fearful to Tarzan.  It was  quite helpless against even the lesser of the jungle creatures.  Tarzan  wondered how it had survived at all.  He tried to teach it, and found a  ray of hope in the fact that Go-bu-balu had mastered a few words of the  language of the anthropoids, and that he could now cling to a  high-tossed branch without screaming in fear; but there was something  about the child which worried Tarzan.  He often had watched the blacks  within their village.  He had seen the children playing, and always  there had been much laughter; but little Go-bu-balu never laughed.  It  was true that Tarzan himself never laughed.  Upon occasion he smiled,  grimly, but to laughter he was a stranger.  The black, however, should  have laughed, reasoned the ape-man.  It was the way of the Gomangani.    Also, he saw that the little fellow often refused food and was growing  thinner day by day.  At times he surprised the boy sobbing softly to  himself.  Tarzan tried to comfort him, even as fierce Kala had  comforted Tarzan when the ape-man was a balu, but all to no avail.  Go-bu-balu merely no longer feared Tarzan--that was all.  He feared  every other living thing within the jungle.  He feared the jungle days  with their long excursions through the dizzy tree tops.  He feared the  jungle nights with their swaying, perilous couches far above the  ground, and the grunting and coughing of the great carnivora prowling  beneath him.    Tarzan did not know what to do.  His heritage of English blood rendered  it a difficult thing even to consider a surrender of his project,  though he was forced to admit to himself that his balu was not all that  he had hoped.  Though he was faithful to his self-imposed task, and  even found that he had grown to like Go-bu-balu, he could not deceive  himself into believing that he felt for it that fierce heat of  passionate affection which Teeka revealed for Gazan, and which the  black mother had shown for Go-bu-balu.    The little black boy from cringing terror at the sight of Tarzan passed  by degrees into trustfulness and admiration.  Only kindness had he ever  received at the hands of the great white devil-god, yet he had seen  with what ferocity his kindly captor could deal with others.  He had  seen him leap upon a certain he-ape which persisted in attempting to  seize and slay Go-bu-balu. He had seen the strong, white teeth of the  ape-man fastened in the neck of his adversary, and the mighty muscles  tensed in battle.  He had heard the savage, bestial snarls and roars of  combat, and he had realized with a shudder that he could not  differentiate between those of his guardian and those of the hairy ape.    He had seen Tarzan bring down a buck, just as Numa, the lion, might  have done, leaping upon its back and fastening his fangs in the  creature's neck.  Tibo had shuddered at the sight, but he had thrilled,  too, and for the first time there entered his dull, Negroid mind a  vague desire to emulate his savage foster parent.  But Tibo, the little  black boy, lacked the divine spark which had permitted Tarzan, the  white boy, to benefit by his training in the ways of the fierce jungle.  In imagination he was wanting, and imagination is but another name for  super-intelligence.    Imagination it is which builds bridges, and cities, and empires.  The  beasts know it not, the blacks only a little, while to one in a hundred  thousand of earth's dominant race it is given as a gift from heaven  that man may not perish from the earth.    While Tarzan pondered his problem concerning the future of his balu,  Fate was arranging to take the matter out of his hands.  Momaya, Tibo's  mother, grief-stricken at the loss of her boy, had consulted the tribal  witch-doctor, but to no avail.  The medicine he made was not good  medicine, for though Momaya paid him two goats for it, it did not bring  back Tibo, nor even indicate where she might search for him with  reasonable assurance of finding him.  Momaya, being of a short temper  and of another people, had little respect for the witch-doctor of her  husband's tribe, and so, when he suggested that a further payment of  two more fat goats would doubtless enable him to make stronger  medicine, she promptly loosed her shrewish tongue upon him, and with  such good effect that he was glad to take himself off with his zebra's  tail and his pot of magic.    When he had gone and Momaya had succeeded in partially subduing her  anger, she gave herself over to thought, as she so often had done since  the abduction of her Tibo, in the hope that she finally might discover  some feasible means of locating him, or at least assuring herself as to  whether he were alive or dead.    It was known to the blacks that Tarzan did not eat the flesh of man,  for he had slain more than one of their number, yet never tasted the  flesh of any.  Too, the bodies always had been found, sometimes  dropping as though from the clouds to alight in the center of the  village.  As Tibo's body had not been found, Momaya argued that he  still lived, but where?    Then it was that there came to her mind a recollection of Bukawai, the  unclean, who dwelt in a cave in the hillside to the north, and who it  was well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#16)"],[1,"  Beads of moisture started out on the sheriff's forehead. Hastily he  started on down the arroyo and found another rock, with an edge not  nearly so favorable in appearance, but this time it was granite. He  leaned his back against it and rubbed with a short shoulder motion  until his arms ached, but it was a happy labor. He felt the rock edge  taking hold of the ropes, fraying the strands to weakness, and then  eating into them. It was very slow work!    The sun drifted up to noon, and still he was leaning against that rock,  working patiently, with his head near to bursting, and perspiration,  which he could not wipe away, running down to blind him. Finally, when  his brain was beginning to reel with the heat, and his shoulders ached  to numbness, the last strand parted. The sheriff dropped down to the  ground to rest.    Presently he drew out his jackknife and methodically cut the remaining  bonds. It came to him suddenly, as he stood up, that someone might have  seen this singular performance and carried the tale away for future  laughter. The thought drove the sheriff mad. He swung savagely into the  saddle and drove his horse at a dead run among the perilous going of  that gorge. When he reached the plain he paused, hesitant between a  bulldog desire to follow the trail single-handed into the mountains and  run down the pair, and a knowledge that he who retreats has an added  power that would make such a pursuit rash beyond words.    A phrase which he had coined for the gossips of Woodville, came back  into his mind. He was no longer as young as he once was, and even at  his prime he shrewdly doubted his ability to cope with Riley Sinclair.  With the weight of Gaspar thrown in, the thing became an impossibility.  Gaspar might be a weakling, but a man who was capable of murder was  always dangerous.    To have been thwarted once was shame enough, but he dared not risk two  failures with one man. He must have help in plenty from Woodville, and,  fate willing, he would one day have the pleasure of looking down into  the dead face of Sinclair; one day have the unspeakable joy of seeing  the slender form of Gaspar dangling from the end of a rope.    His mind was filled with the wicked pleasure of these pictures until he  came suddenly upon Woodville. He drew his horse back to a dogtrot to  enter the town.    It was a short street that led through Woodville, but, short though it  was, the news that something was wrong with the sheriff reached the  heart of the town before he did. Men were already pouring out on the  veranda of the hotel.    \"Where is he, sheriff?\" was the greeting.    Never before had that question been asked. He switched to one side in  his saddle and made the speech that startled the mind of Woodville for  many a day.    \"Boys, I've been double-crossed. Have any of you heard tell of Riley  Sinclair?\"    He waited apparently calm. Inwardly he was breathless with excitement,  for according to the size of Riley's reputation as a formidable man  would be the size of his disgrace. There was a brief pause. Old Shaw  filled the gap, and he filled it to the complete satisfaction of the  sheriff.    \"Young Hopkins was figured for the hardest man up in Montana way,\" he  said. \"That was till Riley Sinclair beat him. What about Sinclair?\"    \"It was him that double-crossed me,\" said the sheriff, vastly relieved.  \"He come like a friend, stuck me up on the trail when I wasn't lookin'  for no trouble, and he got away with Gaspar.\"    A chorus, astonished, eager. \"What did he do it for?\"    \"No man'll ever know,\" said the sheriff.    \"Why not?\"    \"Because Sinclair'll be dead before he has a chance to look a jury in  the face.\"    There were more questions. The little crowd had got its breath again,  and the words came in volleys. The sheriff cut sharply through the  noise.    \"Where's Bill Wood?\"    \"He's in town now.\"    \"Charley, will you find Billy for me and ask him to slide over to my  office? Thanks! Where's Arizona and Red Chalmers?\"    \"They went back to the ranch.\"    \"Be a terrible big favor if you'd go out and try to find 'em for me,  boys. Where's Joe Stockton?\"    \"Up to the Lewis place.\"    Old Shaw struck in: \"You ain't makin' no mistake in picking the best  you can get. You'll need 'em for this Riley Sinclair. I've heard tell  about him. A pile!\"    The very best that Woodville and its vicinity could offer, was indeed  what the sheriff was selecting. Another man would have looked for  numbers, but the sheriff knew well enough that numbers meant little  speed, and speed was one of the main essentials for the task that lay  before him. He knew each of the men he had named, and he had known them  for years, with the exception of Arizona. But the latter, coming up  from the southland, had swiftly proved his ability in many a brawl.    Bill Wood was a peerless trailer; Red Chalmers would, the sheriff felt,  be one day a worthy aspirant for the office which he now held, and Red  was the only man the sheriff felt who could succeed to that perilous  office. As for Joe Stockton, he was distinctly bad medicine, but in a  case like this, it might very well be that poison would be the antidote  for poison. Of all the men the sheriff knew, Joe was the neatest hand  with a gun. The trouble with Joe was that he appreciated his own  ability and was fond of exhibiting his prowess.    Having sent out for his assistants on the chase, the sheriff retired to  his office and set his affairs in order. There was not a great deal of  paper work connected with his position; in twenty minutes he had  cleared his desk, and, by the time he had finished this task, the first  of his posse had sauntered into the doorway and stood leaning idly  there, rolling a cigarette.    \"Have a chair, Bill, will you?\" said the sheriff. He tilted back in his  own and tossed his heels to the top of his desk. \"Getting sort of warm  today, ain't it?\"    Bill Wood had never seen the sheriff so cheerful. He sat down gingerly,  knowing well that some task of great danger lay before them.          14      All that Gaspar dreaded in Riley Sinclair had come true. The  schoolteacher drew his horse as far away as the trail allowed and rode  on in silence. Finally there was a stumble, and it seemed as if the  words were jarred out from his lips, hitherto closely compressed:  \"_You_ killed Quade!\"    A scowl was his answer.    But he persisted in the inquiry with a sort of trembling curiosity,  though he could see the angry emotions rise in Sinclair. The emotion of  a murderer, perhaps?    \"How?\"    \"With a gun, fool. How d'you think?\"    Even that did not halt John Gaspar.    \"Was it a fair fight?\"    \"Maybe--maybe not. It won't bring him back to life!\"    Riley laughed with savage satisfaction. Gaspar watched him as a bird  might watch a snake. He had heard tales of men who could find  satisfaction in a murder, but he had never believed that a human being  could actually gloat over his own savagery. He stared at Riley as if he  were looking at a wild beast that must be placated.    Thereafter the talk was short. Now and again Sinclair gave some curt  direction, but they put mile after mile behind them without a single  phrase interchanged. Gaspar began to slump in the saddle. It brought a  fierce rebuke from Sinclair.    \"Straighten up. Put some of your weight in them stirrups. D'you think  any hoss can buck up when it's carrying a pile of lead? Come alive!\"    \"It's the heat. It takes my strength,\" protested Gaspar.    \"Curse you and your strength! I wouldn't trade all of you for one ear  of the hoss you're riding. Do what I tell you!\"    Without protest, without a flush of shame at this brutal abuse, John  Gaspar attempted to obey. Then, as they topped a rise and reached a  crest of a range of hills, Gaspar cried out in surprise. Sour Creek lay  in the hollow beneath them.    \"But you're running straight into the face of danger!\"    \"Don't tell me what I'm doing. I know maybe, all by myself!\"    He checked his horse and sat his saddle, eying Gaspar with such  disgust, such concentrated scorn and contempt, that the schoolteacher  winced.    \"I've brought you in sight of the town so's you can go home.\"    \"And be hanged?\"    \"You won't be hanged. I'll send a confession along with you. I've  busted the law once. They're after me. They might as well have some  more reasons for hitting my trail.\"    \"But is it fair to you?\" asked Gaspar, intertwining his nervous  fingers.    Sinclair heard the words and eyed the gesture with unutterable disgust.  At last he could speak.    \"Fair?\" he asked in scorn. \"Since when have you been interested in  playing fair? Takes a man with some nerve to play fair. You've spoiled  my game, Gaspar. You've blocked me every way from the start, Cold Feet.  I killed Quade, and they's another in Sour Creek that needs killing.  That's something you can do. Go down and tell the sheriff when he  happens along and show him my confession. Go down and tell him that I  ain't running away--that I'm staying close, and that I'm going to nab  my second man right under his nose. That'll give him something to think  about.\"    He favored the schoolteacher with another black look and then swung out  of the saddle, throwing his reins. He sat down with his back to a  stunted tree. Gaspar dismounted likewise and hovered near, after the  fashion of a man who is greatly worried. He watched while Sinclair  deliberately took out an old stained envelope and the stub of a pencil  and started to write. His brows knitted in pain with the effort.  Suddenly Gaspar cried: \"Don't do it, Mr. Sinclair!\"    A slight lifting of Sinclair's heavy brows showed that he had heard,  but he did not raise his head.    \"Don't do what?\"    \"Don't try to kill that second man. Don't do it!\"    Gaspar was rewarded with a sneer.    \"Why not?\"    The schoolteacher was desperately eager. His glance roved from the set  face of the cowpuncher and through the scragged"]]]
