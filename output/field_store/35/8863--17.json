The soil of Egypt and Babylonia not only supported a dense  population, but also supplied food for neighboring peoples. These two  lands were the granaries of the East.    [Illustration: PLOWING AND SOWING IN ANCIENT EGYPT]    MANUFACTURING    Many industries of to-day were known in ancient Egypt and Babylonia. There  were blacksmiths, carpenters, stonecutters, workers in ivory, silver, and  gold, weavers, potters, and glass blowers. The creations of these ancient  craftsmen often exhibit remarkable skill. Egyptian linens were so  wonderfully fine and transparent as to merit the name of \"woven air.\"  Babylonian tapestries, carpets, and rugs enjoyed a high reputation for  beauty of design and color. Egyptian glass with its waving lines of  different hues was much prized. Precious stones were made into beads,  necklaces, charms, and seals. The precious metals were employed for a  great variety of ornaments. Egyptian paintings show the goldsmiths at work  with blowpipe and forceps, fashioning bracelets, rings, and diadems,  inlaying objects of stone and wood, or covering their surfaces with fine  gold leaf. The manufacture of tiles and glazed pottery was everywhere  carried on. Babylonia is believed to be the original home of porcelain.  Enameled bricks found there are unsurpassed by the best products of the  present day.    TRADE    The development of the arts and crafts brought a new industrial class into  existence. There was now need of merchants and shopkeepers to collect  manufactured products where they could be readily bought and sold. The  cities of Babylonia, in particular, became thriving markets. Partnerships  between tradesmen were numerous. We even hear of commercial companies.  Business life in ancient Babylonia wore, indeed, quite a modern look.    MONEY    Metallic money first circulated in the form of rings and bars. The  Egyptians had small pieces of gold--\"cow gold\"--each of which was simply  the value of a full-grown cow. [3] It was necessary to weigh the metal  whenever a purchase took place. A common picture on the Egyptian monuments  is that of the weigher with his balance and scales. Then the practice  arose of stamping each piece of money with its true value and weight. The  next step was coinage proper, where the government guarantees, not only  the weight, but also the genuineness of the metal.    [Illustration: EGYPTIAN WEIGHING \"COW GOLD\"]    COINAGE    The honor of the invention of coinage is generally given to the Lydians,  whose country was well supplied with the precious metals. As early as the  eighth century B.C. the Lydian monarchs began to strike coins of electrum,  a natural alloy of gold and silver. The famous Croesus,[4] whose name is  still a synonym for riches, was the first to issue coins of pure gold and  silver. The Greek neighbors of Lydia quickly adopted the art of coinage  and so introduced it into Europe. [5]    BANKING    The use of money as a medium of exchange led naturally to a system of  banking. In Babylonia, for instance, the bankers formed an important and  influential class. One great banking house, established at Babylon before  the age of Sennacherib, carried on operations for several centuries.  Hundreds of legal documents belonging to this firm have been discovered in  the huge earthenware jars which served as safes. The Babylonian temples  also received money on deposit and loaned it out again, as do our modern  banks. Knowledge of the principles of banking passed from Babylonia to  Greece and thence to ancient Italy and Rome.      15. COMMERCE AND TRADE ROUTES    ASIATIC COMMERCE    The use of the precious metals as money greatly aided the exchange of  commodities between different countries. The cities of the Tigris-  Euphrates valley were admirably situated for commerce, both by sea and  land. They enjoyed a central position between eastern and western Asia.  The shortest way by water from India skirted the southern coast of Iran  and, passing up the Persian Gulf, gained the valley of the two great  rivers. Even more important were the overland roads from China and India  which met at Babylon and Nineveh. Along these routes traveled long lines  of caravans laden with the products of the distant East--gold and ivory,  jewels and silks, tapestries, spices, and fine woods. Still other avenues  of commerce radiated to the west and entered Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.  Many of these trade routes are in use even to-day.    [Illustration: Map, ANCIENT TRADE ROUTES]    COMMERCE WITH EUROPE    While the inhabitants of Babylonia and Assyria were able to control the  caravan routes of Asia, it was reserved for a Syrian people, the  Phoenicians, to become the pioneers of commerce with Europe. As early as  1500 B.C. the rich copper mines of Cyprus attracted Phoenician colonists  to this island. [6] From Cyprus these bold mariners and keen business men  passed to Crete, thence along the shores of Asia Minor to the Greek  mainland, and possibly to the Black Sea. Some centuries later the  Phoenicians were driven from these regions by the rising power of the  Greek states. Then they sailed farther westward and established their  trading posts in Sicily, Africa, and Spain. At length they passed through  the strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic and visited the shores of  western Europe and Africa.    [Illustration: Map, PHOENICIAN AND GREEK COLONIES]    PHOENICIAN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS    The Phoenicians obtained a great variety of products from their widely  scattered settlements. The mines of Spain yielded tin, lead, and silver.  The tin was especially valuable because of its use in the manufacture of  bronze. [7] From Africa came ivory, ostrich feathers, and gold; from  Arabia, incense, perfumes, and costly spices. The Phoenicians found a  ready sale for these commodities throughout the East. Still other products  were brought directly to Phoenicia to provide the raw materials for her  flourishing manufactures. The fine carpets and glassware, the artistic  works in silver and bronze, and the beautiful purple cloths [8] produced  by Phoenician factories were exported to every region of the known world.    PHOENICIAN VOYAGES OF EXPLORATION    The Phoenicians were the boldest sailors of antiquity. Some of their long  voyages are still on record. We learn from the Bible that they made  cruises on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean and brought the gold of Ophir--  \"four hundred and twenty talents\"--to Solomon. [9] There is even a story  of certain Phoenicians who, by direction of an Egyptian king, explored the  eastern coast of Africa, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and after three  years' absence returned to Egypt through the strait of Gibraltar. A much  more probable narrative is that of the voyage of Hanno, a Carthaginian  admiral. We still possess a Greek translation of his interesting log book.  It describes an expedition made about 500 B.C. along the western coast of  Africa. The explorers seem to have sailed as far as the country now called  Sierra Leone. Nearly two thousand years elapsed before a similar voyage  along the African coast was undertaken.    PHOENICIAN SETTLEMENTS    Wherever the Phoenicians journeyed, they established settlements. Most of  these were merely trading posts which contained the warehouses for the  storage of their goods. Here the shy natives came to barter their raw  materials for the finished products--cloths, tools, weapons, wine, and  oil--which the strangers from the East had brought with them. Phoenician  settlements sometimes grew to be large and flourishing cities. The colony  of Gades in southern Spain, mentioned in the Old Testament as Tarshish,  [10] survives to this day as Cadiz. The city of Carthage, founded in North  Africa by colonists from Tyre, became the commercial mistress of the  Mediterranean. Carthaginian history has many points of contact with that  of the Greeks and Romans.      16. LAW AND MORALITY    BABYLONIAN CONTRACTS    It is clear that societies so highly organized as Phoenicia, Egypt, and  Babylonia must have been held together by the firm bonds of law. The  ancient Babylonians, especially, were a legal-minded people. When a man  sold his wheat, bought a slave, married a wife, or made a will, the  transaction was duly noted on a contract tablet, which was then filed away  in the public archives. Instead of writing his name, a Babylonian stamped  his seal on the wet clay of the tablet. Every man who owned property had  to have a seal.    CODE OF HAMMURABI    The earliest laws were, of course, unwritten. They were no more than the  long-established customs of the community. As civilization advanced, the  usages that generally prevailed were written out and made into legal  codes. A recent discovery has given to us the almost complete text of the  laws which Hammurabi, the Babylonian king, ordered to be engraved on stone  monuments and set up in all the chief cities of his realm. [11]    SUBJECT MATTER OF HAMMURABI'S CODE    The code of Hammurabi shows, in general, a high sense of justice. A man  who tries to bribe a witness or a judge is to be severely punished. A  farmer who is careless with his dikes and allows the water to run through  flood his neighbor's land must restore the value of the grain he has  damaged. The owner of a vicious ox which has gored a man must pay a heavy  fine, provided he knew the disposition of the animal and had not blunted  its horns. A builder who puts up a shaky house which afterwards collapses  and kills the tenant is himself to be put to death. On the other hand, the  code has some rude features. Punishments were severe. For injuries to the  body there was the simple rule of retaliation: an eye for an eye, a tooth  for a tooth, a limb for a limb. A son who had struck his father was to  have his hands cut off. The nature of the punishment depended, moreover,  on the rank of the aggrieved party. A person who had caused the loss of a  \"gentleman's\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7965"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#15)"],[1,"fragrant  paste unseasonably. Who are ye, therefore, thus decked with flowers,  and with hands bearing the marks of the bow-string? Attired in coloured  robes and decked unseasonably with flowers and paste, ye give me to  understand that ye are Brahmanas, although ye bear Kshatriya energy.  Tell me truly who ye are. Truth decks even kings. Breaking down the  peak of the Chaityaka hill, why have ye, in disguise, entered (the  city) by an improper gate without fear of the royal wrath? The energy  of a Brahmana dwelleth in his speech, (not in act). This your feat is  not suited to the order to which ye profess to belong. Tell us  therefore, the end ye have in view. Arrived here by such an improper  way, why accept ye not the worship I offer? What is your motive for  coming to me?' Thus addressed by the king, the high-souled Krishna,  well-skilled in speech, thus replied unto the monarch in a calm and  grave voice.    \"Krishna said,--'O king, know us for Snataka Brahmanas. Brahmanas and  Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are all, O monarch, competent to observe the  vow of Snataka. This vow, besides, hath (many) especial and general  rules. A Kshatriya observing this vow with especial rules always  achieve prosperity. Therefore, have we decked ourselves with flowers.  Kshatriyas again, O king, exhibit their energy by their arms and not in  speech. It is, therefore, O son of Vrihadratha, that the speeches  uttered by a Kshatriya are never audacious. O monarch, the creator hath  planted his own energy in the aim of the Kshatriya. If thou wishest to  behold it, thou shalt certainly behold it today. These are the rules of  the ordinance, viz., that an enemy's abode should be entered through a  wrong gate and a friend's abode through the right one. And know, O  monarch, that this also is our eternal vow that having entered the  foe's abode for the accomplishment of our purpose, we accept not the  worship offered to us!'      SECTION XXII    \"Jarasandha said,--'I do not recollect if I ever acted injuriously  towards ye! Even upon a careful mental scrutiny I fail to see the  injury I did unto ye. When I have never done ye an injury, why, ye  Brahmanas do ye regard me, who am innocent, as your foe? O, answer me  truly, for this, indeed, is the rule followed by the honest. The mind  is pained at the injury to one's pleasure and morality. That Kshatriya  who injures an innocent man's (sources of) pleasure and morality even  if he be otherwise a great warrior and well-versed in all rules of  morality, obtains, without any doubt the fate of sinners (hereafter)  and falls off from prosperity. The practices of the Kshatriyas are the  best of those that are honest in the three worlds. Indeed, those that  are acquainted with morality applaud the Kshatriya practices. Adhering  to those practices of my order with steady soul, I never injure those  that are under me. In bringing this charge, therefore, against me, it  appears that ye speak erroneously!'    \"Krishna said,--'O thou of mighty arms, there is a certain person of  the head of a (royal) line who upholdeth the dignity of his race. At  his command have we come against thee. Thou hast brought, O king, many  of the Kshatriyas of the world as captives (to thy city.) Having  perpetrated that wicked wrong how dost thou regard thyself as innocent?  O best of monarchs, how can a king act wrongfully towards other  virtuous kings? But thou, O king, treating other kings with cruelty,  seekest to offer them as sacrifice unto the god Rudra! O son of  Vrihadratha, this sin committed by thee may touch even us, for as we  are virtuous in our practices, we are capable of protecting virtue. The  slaughter of human being as sacrifice unto the gods is never seen. Why  dost thou, therefore, seek to perform a sacrifice unto god Sankara by  slaughtering human beings? Thou art addressing persons belonging to thy  own order as animals (fit for sacrifice)! Fool as thou art, who else, O  Jarasandha, is capable of behaving in this way? One always obtaineth  the fruits of whatever acts one performeth under whatever  circumstances. Therefore, desirous as we are of helping all distressed  people, we have, for the prosperity of our race, come hither to slay  thee, the slaughterer of our relatives. Thou thinkest that there is no  man among the Kshatriyas (equal to thee). This, O king, is a great  error of judgment on thy part. What Kshatriya is there, O king, who  endued with greatness of soul and recollecting the dignity of his own  parentage, would not ascend to eternal heaven that hath not its like  anywhere, falling in open fight? Know O bull among men, that Kshatriyas  engage themselves in battle, as persons installed in sacrifices, with  heaven in view, and vanquish the whole world! Study of the Vedas, great  fame, ascetic penances, and death in battle, are all acts that lead to  heaven. The attainment of heaven by the three other acts may be  uncertain, but death in battle hath that for its certain consequence.  Death in battle is the sure cause of triumph like Indra's. It is graced  by numerous merits. It is for this reason that he of a hundred  sacrifices (Indra) hath become what he is, and by vanquishing the  Asuras he ruleth the universe. Hostility with whom else than thee is so  sure of leading to heaven, proud as thou art of the excessive strength  of thy vast Magadha host? Don't disregard others, O king. Valour  dwelleth in every man. O king of men, there are many men whose valour  may be equal or superior to thine. As long as these are not known, so  long only art thou noted for thy valour. Thy prowess, O king, can be  borne by us. It is, therefore, that I say so. O king of Magadha, cast  off thy superiority and pride in the presence of those that are thy  equals. Go not, O king, with thy children and ministers and army, into  the regions of Yama. Damvodhava, Kartavirya, Uttara, and Vrihadratha,  were kings that met with destruction, along with all their forces, for  having disregarded their superiors. Desirous of liberating the captive  monarchs from thee, know that we are certainly not Brahmanas. I am  Hrishesha otherwise called Sauri, and these two heroes among men are  the sons of Pandu. O king of Magadha, we challenge thee. Fight standing  before us. Either set free all the monarchs, or go thou to the abode of  Yama.'    \"Jarasandha said,--'I never make a captive of a king without first  vanquishing him. Who hath been kept here that hath not been defeated in  war? This, O Krishna, it hath been said, is the duty that should be  followed by the Kshatriyas, viz., to bring others under sway by the  exhibition of prowess and then to treat them as slaves. Having gathered  these monarchs with the intention of offering them as sacrifices unto  the god, how shall I, O Krishna, from fear liberate them to-day, when I  recollect also the duty I have recited of a Kshatriya? With troops  against troops arrayed in order of battle, or alone against one, or  against two, or against three, at the same time or separately, I am  ready to fight.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"Having spoken thus, and desiring to fight with  those heroes of terrible achievements, king Jarasandha ordered (his  son) Sahadeva to be installed on the throne. Then, O bull of the  Bharata race, the king, on the eve of battle, thought of his two  generals Kausika and Chitrasena. These two, O king, were formerly  called by everybody in the world of men by the respectful appellations  of Hansa and Dimvaka. And, O monarch, that tiger among men, the lord  Sauri ever devoted to truth, the slayer of Madhu, the younger brother  of Haladhara, the foremost of all persons having their senses under  complete control, keeping in view the command of Brahma and remembering  that the ruler of Magadha was destined to be slain in battle by Bhima  and not by the descendant of Madhu (Yadavas), desired not to slay  himself king Jarasandha, that foremost of all men endued with strength,  that hero possessed of the prowess of a tiger, that warrior of terrible  valour.\"      SECTION XXIII    Vaisampayana said,--\"then that foremost of all speakers, Krishna of the  Yadava race, addressing king Jarasandha who was resolved upon fighting,  said,--'O king, with whom amongst us three dost thou desire to fight?  Who amongst us shall prepare himself for battle (with thee)?' Thus  addressed, the ruler of Magadha, king Jarasandha of great splendour,  expressed his desire for fighting with Bhima. The priest then, bringing  with him the yellow pigment obtained from the cow and garlands of  flowers and other auspicious articles, as also various excellent  medicines for restoring lost consciousness and alleviating pain,  approached Jarasandha, panting for battle. The king Jarasandha, on  whose behalf propitiatory ceremonies with benedictions were performed  by a renowned Brahmana, remembering the duty of a Kshatriya dressed  himself for battle. Taking off his crown and binding his hair properly,  Jarasandha stood up like an ocean bursting its continents. Then the  monarch possessed of terrible prowess, addressing Bhima, said, 'I will  fight with thee. It is better to be vanquished by a superior person.'  And saying this, Jarasandha, that represser of all foes endued, rushed  with great energy at Bhimasena like the Asura Vala of old who rushed at  the chief of the celestials. And the mighty Bhimasena, on whose behalf  the gods had been invoked by Krishna, that cousin of his, having  consulted with advanced towards Jarasandha, impelled by the desire of  fight. Then those tigers among men, those heroes of great prowess, with  their bare arms as their only weapons, cheerfully engaged themselves in  the encounter, each desirous of vanquishing the other.
