Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen and  ladies might see; and at last to end the matter, ran lightly over the  drawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursuing him with his club. Then,  coming to the middle of the bridge, the giant's great weight broke  it down, and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled and  wallowed like a whale. Jack, standing by the moat, laughed at him all  the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him scoff, and plunged  from place to place in the moat, yet he could not get out to be  revenged. Jack at length got a cart-rope and cast it over the two heads  of the giant, and drew him ashore by a team of horses, and then cut  off both his heads with his sword of sharpness, and sent them to King  Arthur.    After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking leave of the  knights and ladies, set out for new adventures. Through many woods he  passed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. Here, late  at night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door, which was  opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow. \"Father,\" said Jack,  \"can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way?\" \"Yes,\" said  the old man; \"you are right welcome to my poor cottage.\" Whereupon Jack  entered, and down they sat together, and the old man began to speak as  follows: \"Son, I see by your belt you are the great conqueror of giants,  and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle,  this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and he by the help of an  old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies into his castle, where by  magic art they are transformed into sundry shapes and forms. But above  all, I grieve for a duke's daughter, whom they fetched from her father's  garden, carrying her through the air in a burning chariot drawn by fiery  dragons, when they secured her within the castle, and transformed her  into a white hind. And though many knights have tried to break the  enchantment, and work her deliverance, yet no one could accomplish it,  on account of two dreadful griffins which are placed at the castle gate  and which destroy every one who comes near. But you, my son, may pass  by them undiscovered, where on the gates of the castle you will find  engraven in large letters how the spell may be broken.\" Jack gave the  old man his hand, and promised that in the morning he would venture his  life to free the lady.    In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap  and shoes, and prepared himself for the fray. Now, when he had reached  the top of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins, but  passed them without fear, because of his invisible coat. When he had got  beyond them, he found upon the gates of the castle a golden trumpet hung  by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:      \"Whoever shall this trumpet blow,    Shall soon the giant overthrow,    And break the black enchantment straight;    So all shall be in happy state.\"    Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at which the  castle trembled to its vast foundations, and the giant and conjurer were  in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair, knowing  their wicked reign was at an end. Then the giant stooping to take up  his club, Jack at one blow cut off his head; whereupon the conjurer,  mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind. Then the  enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who had so long  been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes,  and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. This being done, the  head of Galligantua was likewise, in the usual manner, conveyed to the  Court of King Arthur, where, the very next day, Jack followed, with the  knights and ladies who had been delivered. Whereupon, as a reward  for his good services, the king prevailed upon the duke to bestow his  daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married they were, and the  whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding. Furthermore, the king  bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a very beautiful estate thereto  belonging, where he and his lady lived in great joy and happiness all  the rest of their days.          HENNY-PENNY    One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard  when--whack!--something hit her upon the head. \"Goodness gracious me!\"  said Henny-penny; \"the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the  king.\"    So she went along and she went along and she went along till she met  Cocky-locky. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Oh!  I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,\" says Henny-penny. \"May  I come with you?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Certainly,\" says Henny-penny. So  Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell-the king the sky was falling.    They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met  Ducky-daddles. \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-locky?\"  says Ducky-daddles. \"Oh! we're going to tell the king the sky's  a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. \"May I come with you?\"  says Ducky-daddles. \"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. So  Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles went to tell the king the sky  was a-falling.    So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they  met Goosey-poosey, \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and  Ducky-daddles?\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Oh! we're going to tell the  king the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and  Ducky-daddles. \"May I come with you,\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Certainly,\"  said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. So Henny-penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey went to tell the king the  sky was a-falling.    So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till  they met Turkey-lurkey. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,  Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?\" says Turkey-lurkey. \"Oh! we're going  to tell the king the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,  Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey. \"May I come with you? Henny-penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey?\" said Turkey-lurkey. \"Why,  certainly, Turkey-lurkey,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,  and Goosey-poosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,  Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell the king the sky was  a-falling.    So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till  they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,  Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey: \"Where are you  going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,  and Turkey-lurkey?\" And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,  Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: \"We're going to tell  the king the sky's a-falling.\" \"Oh! but this is not the way to the  king, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and  Turkey-lurkey,\" says Foxy-woxy; \"I know the proper way; shall I show  it you?\" \"Why certainly, Foxy-woxy,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,  Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy  all went to tell the king the sky was a-falling. So they went along,  and they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and  dark hole. Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's cave. But Foxy-woxy  said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and  Turkey-lurkey: \"This is the short way to the king's palace you'll  soon get there if you follow me. I will go first and you come  after, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky daddles, Goosey-poosey, and  Turkey-lurkey.\" \"Why of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?\"  said Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and  Turkey-lurkey.    So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far but turned  round to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey  and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went through the  dark hole into the cave. He hadn't got far when \"Hrumph,\" Foxy-woxy  snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his left  shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey went in, and \"Hrumph,\" off went her head  and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky-daddles  waddled down, and \"Hrumph,\" snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky-daddles'  head was off and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-lurkey and  Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave and he  hadn't gone far when \"Snap, Hrumph!\" went Foxy-woxy and Cocky-locky was  thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey and Ducky-daddles.    But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first  snap only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to  Henny-penny. So she turned tail and ran back home, so she never told the  king the sky was a-falling.          CHILDE ROWLAND    Childe Rowland and his brothers twain Were playing at the ball, And  there was their sister Burd Ellen In the midst, among them all.      Childe Rowland kicked it with his foot    And caught it with his knee;    At last as he plunged among them all    O'er the church he made it flee.      Burd Ellen round about the aisle    To seek the ball is gone,    But long they waited, and longer still,    And she came not back again.      They sought her east, they sought her west,    They sought her up and down,    And woe were the hearts of those brethren,    For she was not to be found.    So at last her eldest brother went to the Warlock Merlin and told him  all the case, and asked him if he knew where Burd Ellen was. \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#15)"],[1,"; and so far from being endued with active  graces, zeal, and devotion, and established within itself with purity of  doctrine, union, and firm profession of the faith,1 that on the contrary, what  by the ambition of the clergy, and what by drawing the abstrusest niceties  into controversy, and dividing and subdividing about them into endless schisms  and contentions, they had so destroyed that peace, love, and charity from  among       1  Vide Poc. Spec. p. 163, &c.  2  Vide Hyde ubi sup. p. 4.   1  Ricaut's State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 187.            them, which the Gospel was given to promote; and instead thereof continually  provoked each other to that malice, rancour, and every evil work; that they  had lost the whole substance of their religion, while they thus eagerly  contended for their own imaginations concerning it; and in a manner quite  drove Christianity out of the world by those very controversies in which they  disputed with each other about it.2  In these dark ages it was that most of  those superstitions and corruptions we now justly abhor in the church of Rome  were not only broached, but established; which gave great advantages to the  propagation of Mohammedism.  The worship of saints and images, in particular,  was then arrived at such a scandalous pitch that it even surpassed whatever is  now practised among the Romanists.3     After the Nicene council, the eastern church was engaged in perpetual  controversies, and torn to pieces by the disputes of the Arians, Sabellians,  Nestorians, and Eutychians: the heresies of the two last of which have been  shown to have consisted more in the words and form of expression than in the  doctrines themselves;4 and were rather the pretences than real motives of  those frequent councils to and from which the contentious prelates were  continually riding post, that they might bring everything to their own will  and pleasure.1  And to support themselves by dependants and bribery, the  clergy in any credit at court undertook the protection of some officer in the  army, under the colour of which justice was publicly sold, and all corruption  encouraged.     In the western church Damasus and Ursicinus carried their contests at Rome  for the episcopal seat so high, that they came to open violence and murder,  which Viventius the governor not being able to suppress, he retired into the  country, and left them to themselves, till Damasus prevailed.  It is said that  on this occasion, in the church of Sicininus, there were no less than 137  found killed in one day.  And no wonder they were so fond of these seats, when  they became by that means enriched by the presents of matrons, and went abroad  in their chariots and sedans in great state, feasting sumptuously even beyond  the luxury of princes, quite contrary to the way of living of the country  prelates, who alone seemed to have some temperance and modesty left.2     These dissensions were greatly owing to the emperors, and particularly to  Constantius, who, confounding the pure and simple Christian religion with  anile superstitions, and perplexing it with intricate questions, instead of  reconciling different opinions, excited many disputes, which he fomented as  they proceeded with infinite altercations.3  This grew worse in the time of  Justinian, who, not to be behind the bishops to the fifth and sixth centuries  in zeal, thought it no crime to condemn to death a man of a different  persuasion from his own.4     This corruption of doctrine and morals in the princes and clergy, was  necessarily followed by a general depravity of the people;5 those of all  conditions making it their sole business to get money by any means,       2  Prideaux's preface to his Life of Mahomet.  3  Vide La Vie de  Mahommed, par Boulainvilliers, p. 219, &c.  4  Vide Simon, Hist.

Some of the Christians of that  nation believed the soul died with the body, and was to be raised again with  it at the last day:1 these Origen is said to have convinced.2  Among the Arabs  it was that the heresies of Ebion, Beryllus, and the Nazaræns,3 and also that  of the Collyridians, were broached, or at least propagated; the latter  introduced the Virgin Mary for GOD, or worshipped her as such, offering her a  sort of twisted cake called collyris, whence the sect had its name.4     This notion of the divinity of the Virgin Mary was also believed by some at  the council of Nice, who said there were two gods besides the Father, viz.,  Christ and the Virgin Mary, and were thence named Mariamites.5  Others  imagined her to be exempt from humanity, and deified; which goes but little  beyond the Popish superstition in calling her the complement of the Trinity,  as if it were imperfect without her.  This foolish imagination is justly  condemned in the Korân6 as idolatrous, and gave a handle to Mohammed to attack  the Trinity itself.     Other sects there were of many denominations within the borders of Arabia,  which took refuge there from the proscriptions of the imperial edicts; several  of whose notions Mohammed incorporated with his religion, as may be observed  hereafter.     Though the Jews were an inconsiderable and despised people in other parts  of the world, yet in Arabia, whither many of them fled from the destruction of  Jerusalem, they grew very powerful, several tribes and princes embracing their  religion; which made Mohammed at first show great regard to them, adopting  many of their opinions, doctrines, and customs; thereby to draw them, if  possible, into his interest.  But that people, agreeably to their wonted  obstinacy, were so far from being his proselytes, that they were some of the  bitterest enemies he had, waging continual war with him, so that their  reduction cost him infinite trouble and danger, and at last his life.  This  aversion of theirs created at length as great a one in him to them, so that he  used them, for the latter part of his life, much worse than he did the  Christians, and frequently exclaims against them in his Korân; his followers  to this day observe the same difference between them and the Christians,  treating the former as the most abject and contemptible people on earth.     It has been observed by a great politician,7 that it is impossible a person  should make himself a prince and found a state without opportunities.  If the  distracted state of religion favoured the designs of Mohammed on that side,  the weakness of the Roman and Persian monarchies might flatter him with no  less hopes in any attempt on those once formidable empires, either of which,  had they been in their full vigour, must have crushed Mohammedism in its  birth; whereas nothing nourished it more than the success the Arabians met  with in       6  Vide Boulainvill.

The Roman empire declined apace after Constantine, whose successors were  for the generality remarkable for their ill qualities, especially cowardice  and cruelty.  By Mohammed's time, the western half of the empire was overrun  by the Goths; and the eastern so reduced by the Huns on the one side, and the  Persians on the other, that it was not in a capacity of stemming the violence  of a powerful invasion.  The emperor Maurice paid tribute to the Khagân or  king of the Huns; and after Phocas had murdered his master, such lamentable  havoc there was among the soldiers, that when Heraclius came, not above seven  years after, to muster the army, there were only two soldiers left alive, of  all those who had borne arms when Phocas first usurped the empire.  And though  Heraclius was a prince of admirable courage and conduct, and had done what  possibly could be done to restore the discipline of the army, and had had  great success against the Persians, so as to drive them not only out of his  own dominions, but even out of part of their own; yet still the very vitals of  the empire seemed to be mortally wounded; that there could no time have  happened more fatal to the empire or more favourable to the enterprises of the  Arabs, who seem to have been raised up on purpose by GOD, to be a scourge to  the Christian church, for not living answerably to that most holy religion  which they had received.1     The general luxury and degeneracy of manners into which the Grecians were  sunk, also contributed not a little to the enervating their forces, which were  still further drained by those two great destroyers, monachism and  persecution.     The Persians had also been in a declining condition for some time before  Mohammed, occasioned chiefly by their intestine broils and dissensions; great  part of which arose from the devilish doctrines of Manes and Mazdak.  The  opinions of the former are tolerably well known: the latter lived in the reign  of Khosru Kobâd, and pretended himself a prophet"]]]
