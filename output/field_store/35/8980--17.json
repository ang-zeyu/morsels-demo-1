All was hurry  and confusion to me, as I had my eye on father, fearing he might fall,  it being very slippery, when the baggage-master said, 'Your checks,  madam!' I handed them to him, and rushed into the car; but, before I got  seated, the car started, and I had no checks for my baggage. Again my  heart cried out, 'O, Thou that hearest prayer, take care of my baggage!'  believing He could do that as well as make the conductor wait. In a few  moments the conductor came to me with a face radiant with smiles,  saying, '_Madam, I waited a whole half hour for you_,--_a thing I never  did before since I was a conductor, so much as to wait one minute after  my time_.' He said, 'I know it was your father that I was waiting for,  because there was nothing else on the train for which I could have  waited.' I exclaimed, in a half suppressed tone, 'Praise the Lord!' I  could not help it; it gushed out. Then he said, '_At the very moment all  were on board, and I was ready to start, such a feeling came over me as  I never had in my life before. I could not start_. Something kept saying  to me, _you must wait_, for there is something pending on that train you  must wait for. I waited, and here you are, all safe.' Again my heart  said, Praise the Lord! and he started to leave me, when I said, 'But  there is one thing.' 'What is it?' was his quick reply. 'I gave the  baggage-master my checks, and have none in return.' 'What were the  numbers?' I told him. 'I have them,' he said, handing them to me, 'but  your baggage will not be there till Monday morning. We had no time to  put it on, we had waited so long.'\"        ANOTHER WONDERFUL RECORD OF $25.      _A Christian minister_, living in Northern Indiana, was in want, and  knelt in prayer again and again before his Father in heaven. His  quarterly allowance had been withheld, and want stared him in the face.  Constrained by urgent need, and shut up to God for help, he pleaded  repeatedly for a supply of his temporal wants. Now see how extraordinary  was the plan of the Lord to send relief.    \"In one of the lovely homes of Massachusetts, while the snow was falling  and the winds were howling without, a lady sat on one side of the  cheerful fire, knitting a little stocking for her oldest grandson, and  her husband, opposite to her, was reading aloud a missionary paper, when  the following passage arrested the attention of the lady and fastened  itself in her memory.    \"'In consequence of failure to obtain my salary when due, I have been so  oppressed with care and want, as to make it painfully difficult to  perform my duties as a minister. There is very little prospect,  seemingly, of improvement in this respect for some time to come. What I  say of my own painfully inadequate support, is substantially true of  nearly all your missionaries in this State. You, of course, cannot be  blamed for this. You are but the almoners of the churches, and can be  expected to appropriate only what they furnish. _This, however, the  Master will charge to somebody as a grievous fault;_ for it is not His  will that his ministers should labor unrequited.'    \"This extract was without name or date. It was simply headed 'from a  missionary in Northern Indiana.' Scores of readers probably gave it only  a passing glance. Not so the lady who sat knitting by the fire and heard  her husband read it. The words sank into her mind, and dwelt in her  thoughts. The clause, '_This, however, the Master will charge to  somebody as a grievous fault_,' especially seemed to follow her wherever  she went. The case, she said, haunted her. She seemed to be herself that  very '_somebody_' who was to answer at the bar of God for the curtailed  supplies and straitened means of this humble minister.    \"Impelled by an unseen, but, as she believes, a divine presence and  power, after asking counsel and guidance of the Lord, she took twenty-  five dollars which were at her own disposal, and requested her husband  to give it to the Rev. Dr. H------ for the writer of the above  communication, if he could devise any way to obtain the writer's  address.    \"Doctor H------ is a prompt man, who does not let gold destined to such  an end rest in his pocket. Familiar with the various organizations of  the benevolent societies, and only too happy to have an agency in  supplying the wants of a laborer in Christ's vineyard, he soon started  the money on its appointed errand. Early in April, the lady in her rural  home had the happiness of receiving the following note, of which we omit  nothing, save the names of persons and places:         \"'DEAR MADAM.--I have just received a draft for twenty-five       dollars, as a special donation from you. This I do with       profound gratitude to you for this unselfish and Christ-like       deed, and to Him who put it into your heart to do it. How you,       _a lady a thousand miles away, could know that I was, and had       been for some time, urged by unusual need to pray for succor       and worldly support with unwonted fervency, is a matter of       more than curious inquiry. It is an answer to my prayer, for       the Lord employs the instrumentality of his children to answer       prayer, and, when it is necessary, he moves them to it. This       is not the first nor second time that I have been laid under       special obligation by Christian sympathy and timely aid_. May       He who said, He that giveth a cup of cold water to a disciple,       in the name of a disciple, shall not lose his reward, repay       you a thousand-fold for this favor.'    \"Does not this little incident illustrate the power of prayer? The man  of God, weary and heavy-laden, in his closet in Indiana, spread his case  before the Lord. A disciple in Eastern Massachusetts, _a thousand miles  away_ from the spot where the prayer was offered, who did not know  anything about him or his need, is touched with his wants, and moved to  send him immediate aid.\"      MR. SPURGEON'S COW.      \"My grandfather was a very poor minister, and kept a cow, which was a  very great help in the support of his children--he had ten of them;--and  the cow took the \"staggers\" and died. 'What will you do now?' said my  grandmother. 'I cannot tell what we shall do now,' said he, 'but I know  what God will do: God will provide for us. We must have milk for the  children.'    \"The next morning, there came L20 to him. He had never made application  to the fund for the relief of ministers; but, on that day, there were L5  left when they had divided the money, and one said, 'There is poor Mr.  Spurgeon down in Essex, suppose we send it to him.' The chairman--a Mr.  Morley of his day--said, 'We had better make it L10, and I'll give L5.'  Another L5 was offered by another member, if a like amount could be  raised, to make it up to L20; which was done. They knew nothing about my  grandfather's cow; but God did, you see; and there was the new cow for  him. And those gentlemen in London were not aware of the importance of  the service which they had rendered.                                                        CHARLES SPURGEON.\"      \"TRUST IN THE LORD.\"      \"A poor negro woman, after the death of her husband, had no means of  support for herself and two little children, except the labor of her own  hands; yet she found means out of her deep poverty to give something for  the promotion of the cause of her Redeemer, and would never fail to pay,  on the very day it became due, her regular subscription to the church of  which she was a member. In a hard Winter she had found great difficulty  in supplying the pressing needs of her little family; yet the few pence  for religious purposes had been regularly put by.    \"As one season for the contribution came round, she had only a little  corn, a single salt herring, and a five-cent piece remaining of her  little store. Yet she did not waver; she ground the corn, prepared her  children's supper, and then, with a light heart and cheerful  countenance, set out to meeting, where she gave joyfully the five cents,  _the last she had in the world_.    \"Returning from the church, she passed the house of a lady to whom, a  long time before, she had sold a piece of pork, so long indeed that she  had entirely forgotten the circumstance. But, seeing her this morning,  the lady called her in, apologized for having been so tardy in the  settlement, and then inquired how much it was. Old Sukey did not know,  and the lady, determined to be on the safe side, gave her two dollars,  besides directing her housekeeper to put up a basket of flour, sugar,  coffee, and other luxuries for her use. Poor Sukey returned home with a  joyful heart, saying, as she displayed her treasures, \"See, my children,  the Lord is a good paymaster, giving us 'a hundred-fold even in this  present life, and in the world to come life everlasting.'\"      EXACTLY EIGHTY DOLLARS.--\"THEY ARE SAFE THAT TRUST IN THEE.\"      A clergyman somewhat advanced in years recently related to a  correspondent of _The Messenger_ an incident in his own life, which well  illustrates the provident care of our heavenly Father over his children.    \"His first church was at V----, and, though he labored diligently,  working with his own hands for his support, he became eighty dollars in  debt. It was a grievous burden, and all his efforts to remove it proved  unavailing. One day, when he felt especially cast down, he retired to  pray over the matter, and on his knees he besought the Lord to aid, as  he despaired of help from any other source. He felt strengthened and  hopeful when he left his closet, and entered his church on Sabbath  morning with a lighter heart than usual.

Then a party dashed up to the house, and  were lost to sight.    The prince and Harry both shouted at the top of their voices, but the  roar of the flames and the crash of falling beams deadened the sound.  The heat had by this time become intense. They had gradually divested  themselves of their clothing, and were bathed in perspiration.    \"This heat is terrific,\" Prince Rupert said. \"I did not think the human  frame could stand so great a heat. Methinks that water would boil were  it placed here.\"    This was indeed the case--the human frame, as is now well known, being  capable of sustaining a heat considerably above that of boiling water.  The walls were now so hot that the hand could not be borne upon them for  an instant.    \"My feet are burning!\" the prince exclaimed, \"Reach down that ladder  from the wall.\"    They laid the ladder on the ground and stood upon it, thus avoiding any  contact with the hot stone.    \"If this goes on,\" Prince Rupert said, with a laugh; \"there will be  nothing but our swords left. We are melting away fast, like candles  before a fire. Truly I do not think that there was so much water in a  man as has floated down from me during the last half-hour.\"    Harry was so placed that he could command a sight through the loophole,  and he exclaimed, \"They are riding away!\"    This was indeed the case. The whole building was now one vast furnace,  and having from the first no hope that their friends, if there, could  have survived, they had, hearing that Lady Sidmouth and her daughter had  been taken to Storton, determined to ride thither to take them from the  hands of the Roundheads, and to learn from them the fate of their  leaders.    Another two hours passed. The heat was still tremendous, but they could  not feel that it was increasing. Once or twice they heard terrific  crashes, as portions of the wall fell. They would long since have been  roasted, were it not for the cool air which flowed in through the long  loophole, and keeping up a circulation in the chamber, lowered the  temperature of the air within it. At the end of the two hours Harry gave  a shout.    \"They are coming back.\"    The light had now sunk to a quiet red glow, so that beyond the fact that  a party was approaching, nothing could be seen. They rode, however,  directly toward the turret, and then, when they halted, Harry saw the  figures of two ladies who were pointing toward the loophole. Harry now  stepped from the ladder on to the door and shouted at the top of his  voice through the loophole. The reply came back in a joyous shout.    \"We are being roasted alive,\" Harry cried. \"Get ladders as quickly as  possible, with crowbars, and break down the wall.\"    Men were seen to ride off in several directions instantly, and for the  first time a ray of hope illumined, the minds of the prince and Harry  that they might be saved. Half an hour later long ladders tied together  were placed against the wall, and Jacob speedily made his appearance at  the loophole.    \"All access is impossible from the other side,\" he said, \"for the place  where the house stood is a red-hot furnace, Most of the walls have  fallen. We had no hope of finding you alive.\"    \"We are roasting slowly,\" Harry cried. \"In Heaven's name bring us some  water.\"    Soon a bottle of water was passed in through the loophole, and then  three or four ladders being placed in position, the men outside began  with crowbars and pickaxes to enlarge the loophole sufficiently for the  prisoners to escape. It took three hours' hard work, at the end of which  time the aperture was sufficiently wide to allow them to emerge, and  utterly exhausted and feeling, as the prince said, \"baked to a turn,\"  they made their way down the ladder, being helped on either side by the  men, for they themselves were too exhausted to maintain their feet.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE DEFENSE OF AN OUTPOST.      The effect of the fresh air and of cordials poured down their throats  soon restored the vigor to Prince Rupert and Harry Furness. They were  still weak, for the great effort which nature had made to resist the  force of the heat during those long hours had taxed their constitutions  to the utmost.    Lady Sidmouth was rejoiced indeed to find them alive, for she had made  sure that they were lost. It was not until she had been placed in a room  strongly barred, and under a guard at Storton, that she perceived the  light arising from her residence, and guessed that the men of the  Commons, unable to find the hiding-place of Prince Rupert, had set it on  fire. Then she had knocked loudly at the door; but the sentry had given  no answer either to that or to her entreaties for a hearing. She soon,  indeed, desisted from her efforts, for the fire which blazed up speedily  convinced her that all hope was gone. When Jacob and the Royalists  arrived, driving out the small remnant of the Roundheads who remained in  the village, he had found Lady Sidmouth and her daughter bathed in  tears, under the belief that their guests had perished in the old house  that they loved so well. It was with no hope that they had mounted on  the instant, and ridden at full gallop to the castle, and it was not  until they saw that that wall was still standing that even the slightest  hope entered their minds. Even then it appeared incredible that any one  could be alive, and the shout from the loophole had surprised almost as  much as it had delighted them.    In the course of three or four hours, refreshed and strengthened by a  hearty breakfast and draughts of burgundy, the prince and Harry mounted  their horses. Lady Sidmouth determined to remain for a few days at one  of her tenant's houses, and then to go quietly on to Oxford--for by this  time the main army of Essex was rapidly moving east, and the country  would soon be secure for her passage. The prince and Harry rode at full  speed to rejoin the army. That night, by riding late, they reached it.  They found that Essex had, in his retreat, surprised Cirencester and had  passed Farringdon.    The prince, with five thousand horse, started, and marching with great  rapidity, got between Reading and the enemy, and, near Newbury, fell  upon the Parliament horse. For several hours sharp skirmishing went on,  and Essex was forced to halt his army at Hungerford. This gave time for  the king, who was marching at the head of his infantry, to come up. The  royal army occupied Newbury, and by the position they had taken up, were  now between the Roundheads and London.    On the morning of the 20th of September the outpost of each force became  engaged, and the battle soon raged along the whole line. It was to some  extent a repetition of the battle of Edgehill. Prince Rupert, with his  Cavaliers, swept away the horse of the enemy; but the pikemen of London,  who now first were tried in combat, forced back the infantry of the  king. Prince Rupert, returning from the pursuit, charged them with all  his cavalry; but so sharply did they shoot, and so steadily did the line  of pikes hold together, that the horse could make no impression upon  them.    The night fell upon an undecided battle, and the next morning the  Roundheads, as at Edgehill, drew off from the field, leaving to the  Royalists the honor of a nominal success, a success, however, which was  in both cases tantamount to a repulse.    Three leading men upon the king's side fell--Lords Falkland, Carnarvon,  and Sunderland. The former, one of the finest characters of the times,  may be said to have thrown away his life. He was utterly weary of the  terrible dissensions and war in which England was plunged. He saw the  bitterness increasing on both sides daily--the hopes of peace growing  less and less; and as he had left the Parliamentary party, because he  saw that their ambition was boundless, and that they purposed to set up  a despotic tyranny, so he must have bitterly grieved at seeing upon the  side of the king a duplicity beyond all bounds, and want of faith which  seemed to forbid all hope of a satisfactory issue. Thus, then, when the  day of Newbury came, Falkland, whose duties in nowise led him into the  fight, charged recklessly and found the death which there can be little  doubt he sought.    Although the Cavaliers claimed Newbury as a great victory, instead of  advancing upon London they fell back as usual to Oxford.    During the skirmishes Harry had an opportunity of doing a service to an  old friend. The Parliament horse, although valiant and better trained  than that of the Royalists, were yet unable to withstand the impetuosity  with which the latter always attacked, the men seeming, indeed, to be  seized with a veritable panic at the sight of the gay plumes of Rupert's  gentlemen. In a fierce skirmish between Harry's troop and a party of  Parliament horse of about equal strength, the latter were defeated, and  Harry, returning with the main body, found a Puritan officer dismounted,  with his back against a tree, defending himself from the attacks of  three of his men. Harry rode hastily up and demanded his surrender. The  officer looked up, and to his surprise Harry saw his friend Herbert.    \"I am your prisoner, Harry,\" Herbert said, as he lowered the point of  his sword.    \"Not at all!\" Harry exclaimed. \"It would indeed be a strange thing,  Herbert, were I to make you a prisoner. I thought you settled at  Abingdon?\"    Ordering one of his troopers to catch a riderless horse which was  galloping near, he spoke for a moment or two with his friend, and then,  as the horse was brought up, he told him to mount and ride.    \"But you may get into trouble for releasing me,\" Herbert said.    \"I care not if I do,\" Harry replied. \"But you need not be uneasy about  me, for Prince Rupert will stand my friend, and hold me clear of any  complaint that may be made. I will ride forward with you a little, till  you can join your friends.\" "]]]
