Shall I list to the word of the English, who come from the        uttermost sea?    \"The secret, hath it been told you? and what is your message to me?    It is naught but the wide-world story, how the earth and the        heavens began--    How the gods are glad and angry, and a deity once was man.    And so he gathers around him the mantle of doubt and despondency;  he asks if life is, after all, but a dream and delusion, while  ever and ever is forced upon him that other question, \"Where  shall the dreamer awake?\"      X.      I had thought, \"Perchance in the cities where the rulers of        India dwell,    Whose orders flash from the far land, who girdle the earth with        a spell,    They have fathomed the depths we float on, or measured the        unknown main--\"    Sadly they turn from the venture, and say that the quest is        vain.

What a commentary on all this doubt and despondency are the  meditations of the Christian, who, \"sustained and soothed by an  unfaltering trust,\" approaches his grave      Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch    About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams!      --BRYANT.           *       *       *       *       *    II. THE EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE.    The earliest reliable information that we possess of the country  called Greece represents it in the possession of a number of rude  tribes, of which the Pelas'gians were the most numerous and  powerful, and probably the most ancient. Of the early character  of the Pelasgians, and of the degree of civilization to which  they had attained before the reputed founding of Argos, we have  unsatisfactory and conflicting accounts. On the one hand, they  are represented as no better than the rudest barbarians, dwelling  in caves, subsisting on reptiles, herbs, and wild fruits, and  strangers to the simplest arts of civilized life. Other and more  reliable traditions, however, attribute to them a knowledge of  agriculture, and some little acquaintance with navigation; while  there is a strong probability that they were the authors of those  huge structures commonly called Cyclopean, remains of which are  still visible in many parts of Greece and Italy, and on the western  coast of Asia Minor.    Argos, the capital of Ar'golis, is generally considered the most  ancient city of Greece; and its reputed founding by In'achus, a  son of the god O-ce'anus, 1856 years before the Christian era,  is usually assigned as the period of the commencement of Grecian  history. But the massive Cyclopean walls of Argos evidently show  the Pelasgic origin of the place, in opposition to the traditionary  Phoenician origin of Inachus, whose very existence is quite  problematical. Indeed, although many of the traditions of the  Greeks point to a contrary conclusion, the accounts usually given  of early foreign settlers in Greece, who planted colonies there,  founded dynasties, built cities, and introduced a knowledge of  the arts unknown to the ruder natives, must be taken with a great  degree of abatement. The civilization of the Greeks and the  development of their language bear all the marks of home growth,  and probably were little affected by foreign influence. Still,  many of these traditions are exceedingly interesting, and have  attained great celebrity. One of the most celebrated is that  which describes the founding of Athens, one of the renowned  Grecian cities.      THE FOUNDING OF ATHENS.    Ce'crops, an Egyptian, is said to have led a colony from the  Delta to Greece, about the year 1556 B.C. Two years later he  proceeded to Attica, which had been desolated by a deluge a century  before, and there he is said to have founded, on the Cecropian  rock--the Acrop'olis--a city which, under the following  circumstances, he called Athens, in honor of the Grecian goddess  Athe'na, whom the Romans called Minerva.    It is an ancient Attic legend that about this time the gods had  begun to choose favorite spots among the dwellings of man for  their own residence; and whatever city a god chose, he gave to  that city protection, and there that particular deity was  worshipped with special homage. Now, it happened that both Neptune  and Minerva contended for the supremacy over this new city founded  by Cecrops; and Cecrops was greatly troubled by the contest, as  he knew not to which deity to render homage. So Jove summoned a  council of the gods, and they decided that the supremacy should  be given to the one who should confer the greatest gift upon the  favored city. The story of the contest is told by PROFESSOR BLACKIE  in the following verses.    Mercury, the messenger of the gods, being sent to Cecrops, thus  announces to him the decision of the Council:      \"On the peaks of Olympus, the bright snowy-crested,      The gods are assembled in council to-day,    The wrath of Pos-ei'don, the mighty broad-breasted,      'Gainst Pallas, the spear-shaking maid, to allay.    And thus they decree--that Poseidon offended      And Pallas shall bring forth a gift to the place:    On the hill of Erech'theus the strife shall be ended,      When she with her spear, and the god with his mace,    Shall strike the quick rock; and the gods shall deliver      The sentence as Justice shall order; and thou    Shalt see thy loved city established forever,      With Jove for a judge, and the Styx for a vow.\"    So the gods assembled, in the presence of Cecrops himself, on  the \"hill of Erechtheus\"--afterward known as the Athenian  Acropolis--to witness the trial between the rival deities, as  described in the following language. First; Neptune strikes the  rock with his trident:      Lo! at the touch of his trident a wonder!      Virtue to earth from his deity flows;    From the rift of the flinty rock, cloven asunder,      A dark-watered fountain ebullient rose.    Inly elastic, with airiest lightness      It leapt, till it cheated the eyesight; and, lo!    It showed in the sun, with a various brightness,      The fine-woven hues of the heavenly bow.    \"WATER IS BEST!\" cried the mighty, broad-breasted      Poseidon; \"O Cecrops, I offer to thee    To ride on the back of the steeds foamy-crested      That toss their wild manes on the huge-heaving sea.    The globe thou shalt mete on the path of the waters,      To thy ships shall the ports of far ocean be free;    The isles of the sea shall be counted thy daughters,      The pearls of the East shall be gathered for thee!\"    Thus Neptune offered, as his gift--symbolized in the salt spring  that he caused to issue from the rock--the dominion of the sea,  with all the wealth and renown that flow from unrestricted commerce  with foreign lands.    But Minerva was now to make her trial:      Then the gods, with a high-sounding paean,      Applauded; but Jove hushed the many-voiced tide;    \"For now with the lord of the briny AEge'an      Athe'na shall strive for the city,\" he cried.    \"See where she comes!\" and she came, like Apollo,      Serene with the beauty ripe wisdom confers;    The clear-scanning eye, and the sure hand to follow      The mark of the far-sighted purpose, were hers.    Strong in the mail of her father she standeth,      And firmly she holds the strong spear in her hand;    But the wild hounds of war with calm power she commandeth,      And fights but to pledge surer peace to the land.    Chastely the blue-eyed approached, and, surveying      The council of wise-judging gods without fear,    The nod of her lofty-throned father obeying,      She struck the gray rock with her nice-tempered spear.    Lo! from the touch of the virgin a wonder!      Virtue to earth from her deity flows:    From the rift of the flinty rock, cloven asunder,      An olive-tree, greenly luxuriant, rose--    Green but yet pale, like an eye-drooping maiden,      Gentle, from full-blooded lustihood far;    No broad-staring hues for rude pride to parade in,      No crimson to blazon the banners of war.      Mutely the gods, with a calm consultation,      Pondered the fountain and pondered the tree;    And the heart of Poseidon, with high expectation,      Throbbed till great Jove thus pronounced the decree:    \"Son of my father, thou mighty, broad-breasted      Poseidon, the doom that I utter is true;    Great is the might of thy waves foamy-crested      When they beat the white walls of the screaming sea-mew;    Great is the pride of the keel when it danceth,      Laden with wealth, o'er the light-heaving wave--    When the East to the West, gayly floated, advanceth,      With a word from the wise and a help from the brave.    But earth--solid earth--is the home of the mortal      That toileth to live, and that liveth to toil;    And the green olive-tree twines the wreath of his portal      Who peacefully wins his sure bread from the soil,\"    Thus Jove: and to heaven the council celestial      Rose, and the sea-god rolled back to the sea;    But Athena gave Athens her name, and terrestrial      Joy from the oil of the green olive-tree.    Thus Jove decided in favor of the peaceful pursuits of industry  on the land, as against the more alluring promises but uncertain  results of commerce, thereby teaching this lesson in political  economy--that a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#15)"],[1,"of the houses.\"    \"But, my lady--\" I interposed.    \"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few  steps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with  passionate tenderness and kissed me.    \"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as  slave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and  I am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"    \"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden  fright.    She solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,  adorable lips.    We returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also  quickly to get something to eat.    Of course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened  that just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,  the waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:  \"Madame wants you, at once.\"    I took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,  hurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.    \"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said  reproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave  me time to eat in peace.\"    Wanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but  never mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The  martyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"    I followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.    \"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda  continued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is  shut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad  relationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an  entire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now  to satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be  home till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"    I looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and  then I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and  again I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose  round cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,  cloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide  arches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the  green hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and  extensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.    It is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,  smiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and  somberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas  scattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't  a spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious  than we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they  were happy.    It is also maintained that death is easier in the South.    I have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn  and love of the senses without torment does exist.    Wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the  winter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the  Arno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden  with lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.  It is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An  open gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts  of antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.  From the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,  from which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.    Wanda occupies the second story by herself.    A room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very  attractive, and even has a fireplace.    I have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a  little temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink  in the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love  on a white pedestal.    A slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were  smiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before  my mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the  anteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and  knock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury  displayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,  and I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as  if I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and  it seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping  furs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with  her little white powdered curls.    I knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.    \"Why so late?\" she asks.    \"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"  I reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads  me to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The  entire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,  curtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of  Samson and Delilah forms the ceiling.    Wanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin  dress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,  leaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the  dark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red  hair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by  strings of black pearls.    \"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and  threatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and  neither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of  unimagined bliss.    \"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate  tenderness.    \"You ask!\" I exclaimed.    \"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring  smile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I  ask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"    \"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.    \"You have not yet signed the papers.\"    \"Papers--what papers?\"    \"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will  let it go.\"    \"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater  happiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give  everything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even  unto death--\"    \"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so  enthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than  ever and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,  it will be impossible for me to be so.\"    \"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"    \"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I  have drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have  decided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so  desire.\"    \"Give them to me.\"    While I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen  and ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and  looked over my shoulder at the paper.    The first one read:    AGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI    \"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced  of Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining  thereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a  man and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such  time that she herself sets him at liberty again.    \"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and  he is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to  obey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his  mistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an  extraordinary mercy.    \"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she  deems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also  is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her  or merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,  she may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her  unrestricted property.    \"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von  Kusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or  suffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and  in no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.    \"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as  often as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some  cruelty toward her slave.\"    Appended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present  day.    The second document contained only a few words.    \"Having since many years become weary of existence and its  illusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless  life.\"    I was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still  time, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the  sight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder  carried me away.    \"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating  the second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;  this, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"    I quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a  suicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the  table with a smile.    \"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty  smile, inclining her head.    I took the pen.    \"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you  afraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"    She took the agreement and pen. While"]]]
