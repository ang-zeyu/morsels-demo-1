She had colonies and allies among the wealthy and populous  Greek settlements in Sicily and South Italy, but she had no organized  system of confederates in those regions; and her galleys brought her no  tribute from the Western seas. The extension of her empire over Sicily  was the favorite project of her ambitious orators and generals. While  her great statesman, Pericles, lived, his commanding genius kept his  countrymen under control, and forbade them to risk the fortunes of  Athens in distant enterprises, while they had unsubdued and powerful  enemies at their own doors. He taught Athens this maxim; but he also  taught her to know and to use her own strength; and when Pericles had  departed, the bold spirit which he had fostered overleaped the salutary  limits which he had prescribed.    When her bitter enemies, the Corinthians, succeeded, B.C. 431, in  inducing Sparta to attack her, and a confederacy was formed of  five-sixths of the continental Greeks, all animated by anxious jealousy  and bitter hatred of Athens; when armies far superior in numbers and  equipment to those which had marched against the Persians were poured  into the Athenian territory, and laid it waste to the city walls, the  general opinion was that Athens would be reduced, in two or three years  at the furthest, to submit to the requisitions of her invaders. But her  strong fortifications, by which she was girt and linked to her principal  haven, gave her, in those ages, almost all the advantages of an insular  position. Pericles had made her trust to her empire of the seas. Every  Athenian in those days was a practised seaman. A state, indeed, whose  members, of an age fit for service, at no time exceeded thirty thousand,  could only have acquired such a naval dominion as Athens once held by  devoting and zealously training all its sons to service in its fleets.  In order to man the numerous galleys which she sent out, she necessarily  employed large numbers of hired mariners and slaves at the oar; but the  staple of her crews was Athenian, and all posts of command were held by  native citizens. It was by reminding them of this, of their long  practice in seamanship, and the certain superiority which their  discipline gave them over the enemy's marine, that their great minister  mainly encouraged them to resist the combined power of Lacedaemon and  her allies. He taught them that Athens might thus reap the fruit of her  zealous devotion to maritime affairs ever since the invasion of the  Medes; \"she had not, indeed, perfected herself; but the reward of her  superior training was the rule of the sea--a mighty dominion, for it  gave her the rule of much fair land beyond its waves, safe from the idle  ravages with which the Lacedaemonians might harass Attica, but never  could subdue Athens.\"    Athens accepted the war with which her enemies threatened her rather  than descend from her pride of place; and though the awful visitation of  the plague came upon her, and swept away more of her citizens than the  Dorian spear laid low, she held her own gallantly against her enemies.  If the Peloponnesian armies in irresistible strength wasted every spring  her corn-lands, her vineyards, and her olive groves with fire and sword,  she retaliated on their coasts with her fleets; which, if resisted, were  only resisted to display the preeminent skill and bravery of her seamen.  Some of her subject allies revolted, but the revolts were in general  sternly and promptly quelled. The genius of one enemy had indeed  inflicted blows on her power in Thrace which she was unable to remedy;  but he fell in battle in the tenth year of the war, and with the loss of  Brasidas the Lacedaemonians seemed to have lost all energy and judgment.  Both sides at length grew weary of the war, and in 421 a truce for fifty  years was concluded, which, though ill kept, and though many of the  confederates of Sparta refused to recognize it, and hostilities still  continued in many parts of Greece, protected the Athenian territory from  the ravages of enemies, and enabled Athens to accumulate large sums out  of the proceeds of her annual revenues. So also, as a few years passed  by, the havoc which the pestilence and the sword had made in her  population was repaired; and in 415 Athens was full of bold and restless  spirits, who longed for some field of distant enterprise wherein they  might signalize themselves and aggrandize the state, and who looked on  the alarm of Spartan hostility as a mere old-woman's tale. When Sparta  had wasted their territory she had done her worst; and the fact of its  always being in her power to do so seemed a strong reason for seeking to  increase the transmarine dominion of Athens.    The West was now the quarter toward which the thoughts of every aspiring  Athenian were directed. From the very beginning of the war Athens had  kept up an interest in Sicily, and her squadron had, from time to time,  appeared on its coasts and taken part in the dissensions in which the  Sicilian Greeks were universally engaged one against the other. There  were plausible grounds for a direct quarrel, and an open attack by the  Athenians upon Syracuse.    With the capture of Syracuse, all Sicily, it was hoped, would be  secured. Carthage and Italy were next to be attacked. With large levies  of Iberian mercenaries she then meant to overwhelm her Peloponnesian  enemies. The Persian monarchy lay in hopeless imbecility, inviting Greek  invasion; nor did the known world contain the power that seemed capable  of checking the growing might of Athens, if Syracuse once should be  hers.    The national historian of Rome has left us an episode of his great work,  a disquisition on the probable effects that would have followed if  Alexander the Great had invaded Italy. Posterity has generally regarded  that disquisition as proving Livy's patriotism more strongly than his  impartiality or acuteness. Yet, right or wrong, the speculations of the  Roman writer were directed to the consideration of a very remote  possibility. To whatever age Alexander's life might have been prolonged,  the East would have furnished full occupation for his martial ambition,  as well as for those schemes of commercial grandeur and imperial  amalgamation of nations in which the truly great qualities of his mind  loved to display themselves. With his death the dismemberment of his  empire among his generals was certain, even as the dismemberment of  Napoleon's empire among his marshals would certainly have ensued if he  had been cut off in the zenith of his power. Rome, also, was far weaker  when the Athenians were in Sicily than she was a century afterward in  Alexander's time. There can be little doubt but that Rome would have  been blotted out from the independent powers of the West, had she been  attacked at the end of the fifth century B.C. by an Athenian army,  largely aided by Spanish mercenaries, and flushed with triumphs over  Sicily and Africa, instead of the collision between her and Greece  having been deferred until the latter had sunk into decrepitude, and the  Roman Mars had grown into full vigor.    The armament which the Athenians equipped against Syracuse was in every  way worthy of the state which formed such projects of universal empire,  and it has been truly termed \"the noblest that ever yet had been sent  forth by a free and civilized commonwealth.\" The fleet consisted of one  hundred and thirty-four war-galleys, with a multitude of storeships. A  powerful force of the best heavy-armed infantry that Athens and her  allies could furnish was sent on board it, together with a smaller  number of slingers and bowmen. The quality of the forces was even more  remarkable than the number. The zeal of individuals vied with that of  the republic in giving every galley the best possible crew and every  troop the most perfect accoutrements. And with private as well as public  wealth eagerly lavished on all that could give splendor as well as  efficiency to the expedition, the fated fleet began its voyage for the  Sicilian shores in the summer of 415.    The Syracusans themselves, at the time of the Peloponnesian war, were a  bold and turbulent democracy, tyrannizing over the weaker Greek cities  in Sicily, and trying to gain in that island the same arbitrary  supremacy which Athens maintained along the eastern coast of the  Mediterranean. In numbers and in spirit they were fully equal to the  Athenians, but far inferior to them in military and naval discipline.  When the probability of an Athenian invasion was first publicly  discussed at Syracuse, and efforts were made by some of the wiser  citizens to improve the state of the national defences and prepare for  the impending danger, the rumors of coming war and the proposal for  preparation were received by the mass of the Syracusans with scornful  incredulity. The speech of one of their popular orators is preserved to  us in Thucydides.    The Syracusan orator told his countrymen to dismiss with scorn the  visionary terrors which a set of designing men among themselves strove  to excite, in order to get power and influence thrown into their own  hands. He told them that Athens knew her own interest too well to think  of wantonly provoking their hostility: \"Even if the enemies were to  come,\" said he, \"so distant from their resources, and opposed to such a  power as ours, their destruction would be easy and inevitable. Their  ships will have enough to do to get to our island at all, and to carry  such stores of all sorts as will be needed. They cannot therefore carry,  besides, an army large enough to cope with such a population as ours.  They will have no fortified place from which to commence their  operations, but must rest them on no better base than a set of wretched  tents, and such means as the necessities of the moment will allow them.  But,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#16)"],[1,"usehold, and this may be      varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon. It has      often been remarked, too, that nothing is more delightful to the      feminine members of a family, than the reading aloud of some      good standard work or amusing publication. A knowledge of polite      literature may be thus obtained by the whole family, especially      if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult      passages of the book, and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties      it may contain. This plan, in a great measure, realizes the      advice of Lord Bacon, who says, \"Read not to contradict and      refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk      and discourse, but to weigh and consider.\"    49. IN RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT, it is well to remember that early rising  is almost impossible, if late going to bed be the order, or rather  disorder, of the house. The younger members of a family should go early  and at regular hours to their beds, and the domestics as soon as  possible after a reasonably appointed hour. Either the master or the  mistress of a house should, after all have gone to their separate rooms,  see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below; and no  servants should, on any account, be allowed to remain up after the heads  of the house have retired.    50. HAVING THUS GONE FROM EARLY RISING TO EARLY RETIRING, there remain  only now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the  mistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information.    51. WHEN A MISTRESS TAKES A HOUSE in a new locality, it will be  etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the  neighbourhood call upon her; thus evincing a desire, on their part, to  become acquainted with the new comer. It may be, that the mistress will  desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours; but it  is to be specially borne in mind that all visits, whether of ceremony,  friendship, or condolence, should be punctiliously returned.    52. YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED with letters of introduction from  some of your friends, to persons living in the neighbourhood to which  you have just come. In this case inclose the letter of introduction in  an envelope with your card. Then, if the person, to whom it is  addressed, calls in the course of a few days, the visit should be  returned by you within the week, if possible. Any breach of etiquette,  in this respect, will not readily be excused.        In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above      circumstances, nothing but necessity should prevent you from      accepting the invitation. If, however, there is some distinct      reason why you cannot accept, let it be stated frankly and      plainly, for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied.      An opportunity should, also, be taken to call in the course of a      day or two, in order to politely express your regret and      disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of      their kindness.    53. IN GIVING A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION, it should always be handed to  your friend, unsealed. Courtesy dictates this, as the person whom you  are introducing would, perhaps, wish to know in what manner he or she  was spoken of. Should you _receive_ a letter from a friend, introducing  to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer, the letter should  be immediately acknowledged, and your willingness expressed to do all in  your power to carry out his or her wishes.    54. SUCH ARE THE ONEROUS DUTIES which enter into the position of the  mistress of a house, and such are, happily, with a slight but continued  attention, of by no means difficult performance. She ought always to  remember that she is the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega in  the government of her establishment; and that it is by her conduct that  its whole internal policy is regulated. She is, therefore, a person of  far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is. On  her pattern her daughters model themselves; by her counsels they are  directed; through her virtues all are honoured;--\"her children rise up  and call her blessed; her husband, also, and he praiseth her.\"  Therefore, let each mistress always remember her responsible position,  never approving a mean action, nor speaking an unrefined word. Let her  conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her, and such as an  honourable and right-minded man may look for in his wife and the mother  of his children. Let her think of the many compliments and the sincere  homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and  writers, both in ancient and modern times. Let her not forget that she  has to show herself worthy of Campbell's compliment when he said,--      \"The world was sad! the garden was a wild!     And man the hermit sigh'd, till _woman_ smiled.\"    Let her prove herself, then, the happy companion of man, and able to  take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate, Jeremy Taylor, who  says,--\"A good wife is Heaven's last best gift to man,--his angel and  minister of graces innumerable,--his gem of many virtues,--his casket of  jewels--her voice is sweet music--her smiles his brightest day;--her  kiss, the guardian of his innocence;--her arms, the pale of his safety,  the balm of his health, the balsam of his life;--her industry, his  surest wealth;--her economy, his safest steward;--her lips, his faithful  counsellors;--her bosom, the softest pillow of his cares; and her  prayers, the ablest advocates of Heaven's blessings on his head.\"    Cherishing, then, in her breast the respected utterances of the good and  the great, let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of  its management; so that, in doing her duty to all around her, she may  receive the genuine reward of respect, love, and affection!    _Note_.--Many mistresses have experienced the horrors of house-hunting,  and it is well known that \"three removes are as good (or bad, rather) as  a fire.\" Nevertheless, it being quite evident that we must, in these  days at least, live in houses, and are sometimes obliged to change our  residences, it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add  to, or diminish, the convenience and comfort of our homes.    Although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different  circumstances with different people, that to give any specific  directions on this head would be impossible and useless; yet it will be  advantageous, perhaps, to many, if we point out some of those general  features as to locality, soil, aspect, &c., to which the attention of  all house-takers should be carefully directed.    Regarding the locality, we may say, speaking now more particularly of a  town house, that it is very important to the health and comfort of a  family, that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind, producing  unwholesome effluvia or smells, should be strictly avoided. Neither is  it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade  is carried on, as it is unpleasant to the feelings, and tends to  increase any existing irritation of the system.    Referring to soils; it is held as a rule, that a gravel soil is superior  to any other, as the rain drains through it very quickly, and it is  consequently drier and less damp than clay, upon which water rests a far  longer time. A clay country, too, is not so pleasant for walking  exercise as one in which gravel predominates.    The aspect of the house should be well considered, and it should be  borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house, the  healthier is the habitation. The close, fetid smell which assails one on  entering a narrow court, or street, in towns, is to be assigned to the  want of light, and, consequently, air. A house with a south or  south-west aspect, is lighter, warmer, drier, and consequently more  healthy, than one facing the north or north-east.    Great advances have been made, during the last few years, in the  principles of sanitary knowledge, and one most essential point to be  observed in reference to a house, is its \"drainage,\" as it has been  proved in an endless number of cases, that bad or defective drainage is  as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons. This arises from  its injuriously affecting the atmosphere; thus rendering the air we  breathe unwholesome and deleterious. Let it be borne in mind, then, that  unless a house is effectually drained, the health of its inhabitants is  sure to suffer; and they will be susceptible of ague, rheumatism,  diarrhoea, fevers, and cholera.    We now come to an all-important point,--that of the water supply. The  value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more  recognized in connection with the question of health and life; and most  houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water.  Let it, however, be well understood, that no house, however suitable in  other respects, can be desirable, if this grand means of health and  comfort is, in the slightest degree, scarce or impure. No caution can be  too great to see that it is pure and good, as well as plentiful; for,  knowing, as we do, that not a single part of our daily food is prepared  without it, the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates  of a house cannot be over-rated.    Ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked. In a  general way, enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and  windows; but if this be not the case, the chimney will smoke; and other  plans, such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the  upper part of the window, must be used. Cold air should never be  admitted under the doors, or at the bottom of a room, unless it be close  to the fire or stove; for it will flow along the floor towards the  fireplace, and thus leave the foul air in the upper"]]]
