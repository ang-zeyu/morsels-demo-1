RECEPTION OF THE EXPLORERS AT ANNAPOLIS BASIN.--A DREARY WINTER RELIEVED BY  THE ORDER OF BON TEMPS.--NEWS FROM FRANCE.--BIRTH OF A PRINCE.--RUIN OF DE  MONTS'S COMPANY--TWO EXCURSIONS AND DEPARTURE FOR FRANCE.--CHAMPLAIN'S  EXPLORATIONS COMPARED.--DE MONTS'S NEW CHARTER FOR ONE YEAR AND CHAMPLAIN'S  RETURN IN 1608 TO NEW FRANCE AND THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC.--CONSPIRACY OF DU  VAL AND HIS EXECUTION.    With the voyage which we have described in the last chapter, Champlain  terminated his explorations on the coast of New England. He never afterward  stepped upon her soil. But he has left us, nevertheless, an invaluable  record of the character, manners, and customs of the aborigines as he saw  them all along from the eastern borders of Maine to the Vineyard Sound, and  carefully studied them during the period of three consecutive years. Of the  value of these explorations we need not here speak at length. We shall  refer to them again in the sequel.    The return of the explorers was hailed with joy by the colonists at  Annapolis Basin. To give _eclat_ to the occasion, Lescarbot composed a poem  in French, which he recited at the head of a procession which marched with  gay representations to the water's edge, to receive their returning  friends. Over the gateway of the quadrangle formed by their dwellings,  dignified by them as their fort, were the arms of France, wreathed in  laurel, together with the motto of the king.--      DVO PROTEGIT VNVS.    Under this, the arms of De Monts were displayed, overlaid with evergreen,  and bearing the following inscription:--      DABIT DEVS HIS QVOQVE FINEM.    Then came the arms of Poutrincourt, crowned also with garlands, and  inscribed:--      IN VIA VIRTVTI NVLLA EST VIA.    When the excitement of the return had passed, the little settlement  subsided into its usual routine. The leisure of the winter was devoted to  various objects bearing upon the future prosperity of the colony. Among  others, a corn mill was erected at a fall on Allen River, four or five  miles from the settlement, a little east of the present site of Annapolis.  A road was commenced through the forest leading from Lower Granville  towards the mouth of the bay. Two small barques were built, to be in  readiness in anticipation of a failure to receive succors the next summer,  and new buildings were erected for the accommodation of a larger number of  colonists. Still, there was much unoccupied time, and, shut out as they  were from the usual associations of civilized life, it was hardly possible  that the winter should not seem long and dreary, especially to the  gentlemen.    To break up the monotony and add variety to the dull routine of their life,  Champlain contrived what he called L'ORDRE DE BON TEMPS, or The Rule of  Mirth, which was introduced and carried out with spirit and success. The  fifteen gentlemen who sat at the table of De Poutrincourt, the governor,  comprising the whole number of the order, took turns in performing the  duties of steward and caterer, each holding the office for a single day.  With a laudable ambition, the Grand Master for the time being laid the  forest and the sea under contribution, and the table was constantly  furnished with the most delicate and well seasoned game, and the sweetest  as well as the choicest varieties of fish. The frequent change of office  and the ingenuity displayed, offered at every repast, either in the viands  or mode of cooking, something new and tempting to the appetite. At each  meal, a ceremony becoming the dignity of the order was strictly observed.  At a given signal, the whole company marched into the dining-hall, the  Grand Master at the head, with his napkin over his shoulder, his staff of  office in his hand, and the glittering collar of the order about his neck,  while the other members bore each in his hand a dish loaded and smoking  with some part of the delicious repast. A ceremony of a somewhat similar  character was observed at the bringing in of the fruit. At the close of the  day, when the last meal had been served, and grace had been said, the  master formally completed his official duty by placing the collar of the  order upon the neck of his successor, at the same time presenting to him a  cup of wine, in which the two drank to each other's health and happiness.  These ceremonies were generally witnessed by thirty or forty savages, men,  women, boys, and girls, who gazed in respectful admiration, not to say awe,  upon this exhibition of European civilization. When Membertou, [56] the  venerable chief of the tribe, or other sagamores were present, they were  invited to a seat at the table, while bread was gratuitously distributed to  the rest.    When the winter had passed, which proved to be an exceedingly mild one, all  was astir in the little colony. The preparation of the soil, both in the  gardens and in the larger fields, for the spring sowing, created an  agreeable excitement and healthy activity.    On the 24th May, in the midst of these agricultural enterprises, a boat  arrived in the bay, in charge of a young man from St. Malo, named  Chevalier, who had come out in command of the \"Jonas,\" which he had left at  Canseau engaged in fishing for the purpose of making up a return cargo of  that commodity. Chevalier brought two items of intelligence of great  interest to the colonists, but differing widely in their character. The one  was the birth of a French prince, the Duke of Orleans; the other, that the  company of De Monts had been broken up, his monopoly of the fur-trade  withdrawn, and his colony ordered to return to France. The birth of a  prince demanded expressions of joy, and the event was loyally celebrated by  bonfires and a _Te Deum_. It was, however, giving a song when they would  gladly have hung their harps upon the willows.    While the scheme of De Monts's colonial enterprise was defective,  containing in itself a principle which must sooner or later work its ruin,  the disappointment occasioned by its sudden termination was none the less  painful and humiliating. The monopoly on which it was based could only be  maintained by a degree of severity and apparent injustice, which always  creates enemies and engenders strife. The seizure and confiscation of  several ships with their valuable cargoes on the shores of Nova Scotia, had  awakened a personal hostility in influential circles in France, and the  sufferers were able, in turn, to strike back a damaging blow upon the  author of their losses. They easily and perhaps justly represented that the  monopoly of the fur-trade secured to De Monts was sapping the national  commerce and diverting to personal emolument revenues that properly  belonged to the state. To an impoverished sovereign with an empty treasury  this appeal was irresistible. The sacredness of the king's commission and  the loss to the patentee of the property already embarked in the enterprise  had no weight in the royal scales. De Monts's privilege was revoked, with  the tantalizing salvo of six thousand livres in remuneration, to be  collected at his own expense from unproductive sources.    Under these circumstances, no money for the payment of the workmen or  provisions for the coming winter had been sent out, and De Poutrincourt,  with great reluctance, proceeded to break up the establishment. The goods  and utensils, as well as specimens of the grain which they had raised, were  to be carefully packed and sent round to the harbor of Canseau, to be  shipped by the \"Jonas,\" together with the whole body of the colonists, as  soon as she should have received her cargo of fish.    While these preparations were in progress, two excursions were made; one  towards the west, and another northeasterly towards the head of the Bay of  Fundy. Lescarbot accompanied the former, passing several days at St. John  and the island of St. Croix, which was the westerly limit of his  explorations and personal knowledge of the American coast. The other  excursion was conducted by De Poutrincourt, accompanied by Champlain, the  object of which was to search for ores of the precious metals, a species of  wealth earnestly coveted and overvalued at the court of France. They sailed  along the northern shores of Nova Scotia, entered Mines Channel, and  anchored off Cape Fendu, now Anglicised into the uneuphonious name of Cape  Split. De Poutrincourt landed on this headland, and ascended a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#15)"],[1,"objection by offering to join the party  herself; so they all went together. Anne Maria says that Charles treated  her with great politeness and attention all the way, and paid her many  compliments, but made no attempt to bring up again, in any way, the  question of his suit. She was very glad he did not, she says, for her  mind being now occupied with the plan of marrying the emperor, nothing  that he could have said would have done any good.    Thus the question was considered as virtually settled, and King Charles,  soon after, turned his thoughts toward executing the plans which he  had been long revolving for the recovery of his kingdom.          CHAPTER VII    THE ROYAL OAK OF BOSCOBEL.        It was in June, 1650, about eighteen months after the decapitation of  his father, that Charles was ready to set out on his expedition to  attempt the recovery of his rights to the English throne. He was but  twenty years of age. He took with him no army, no supplies, no  resources. He had a small number of attendants and followers, personally  interested themselves in his success, and animated also, probably, by  some degree of disinterested attachment to him. It was, however, on  the whole, a desperate enterprise. Queen Henrietta, in her retirement  at the Louvre, felt very anxious about the result of it. Charles  himself, too, notwithstanding his own buoyant and sanguine temperament,  and the natural confidence and hope pertaining to his years, must have  felt many forebodings. But his condition on the Continent was getting  every month more and more destitute and forlorn. He was a mere guest  wherever he went, and destitute of means as he was, he found himself  continually sinking in public consideration. Money as well as rank is  very essentially necessary to make a relative a welcome guest, for any  long time, in aristocratic circles. Charles concluded, therefore, that,  all things considered, it was best for him to make a desperate effort  to recover his kingdoms.    His kingdoms were three, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Ireland was  a conquered kingdom, Scotland, like England, had descended to him from  his ancestors; for his grandfather, James VI., was king of Scotland,  and being on his mothers side a descendant of an English king, he was,  of course, one of the heirs of the English crown; and on the failure  of the other heirs, he succeeded to that crown, retaining still his  own. Thus both kingdoms descended to Charles.    It was only the English kingdom that had really rebelled against, and  put to death King Charles's father. There had been a great deal of  difficulty in Scotland, it is true, and the republican spirit had  spread quite extensively in that country. Still, affairs had not  proceeded to such extremities there. The Scotch had, in some degree,  joined with the English in resisting Charles the First, but it was not  their wish to throw off the royal authority altogether. They abhorred  episcopacy in the Church, but were well enough contented with monarchy  in the state. Accordingly, soon after the death of the father, they  had opened negotiations with the son, and had manifested their  willingness to acknowledge him as their king, on certain conditions  which they undertook to prescribe to him. It is very hard for a king  to hold his scepter on conditions prescribed by his people. Charles  tried every possible means to avoid submitting to this necessity. He  found, however, that the only possible avenue of access to England was  by first getting some sort of possession of Scotland; and so, signifying  his willingness to comply with the Scotch demands, he set sail from  Holland with his court, moved north ward with his little squadron over  the waters of the German Ocean, and at length made port In the Frith  of Cromarty, in the north of Scotland.    The Scotch government, having but little faith in the royal word of  such a youth as Charles would not allow him to land until he had  formally signed their covenant, by which he bound himself to the  conditions which they had thought it necessary to impose. He then  landed. But he found his situation very far from such as comported  with his ideas of royal authority and state. Charles was a gay,  dissipated, reckless young man. The men whom he had to deal with were  stern, sedate, and rigid religionists. They were scandalized at the  looseness and irregularity of his character and manners. He was vexed  and tormented by what he considered their ascetic bigotry, by the  restraints which they were disposed to put upon his conduct, and the  limits with which they insisted on bounding his authority. Long  negotiations and debates ensued, each party becoming more and more  irritated against the other. At last, on one occasion, Charles lost  his patience entirely, and made his escape into the mountains, in hopes  to raise an army there among the clans of wild Highlanders, who,  accustomed from infancy to the most implicit obedience to their  chieftains, are always very loyal to their king. The Scotch nobles,  however, not wishing to drive him to extremities, sent for him to come  back, and both parties becoming after this somewhat more considerate  and accommodating, they at length came to an agreement, and proceeding  together to Scone, a village some miles north of Edinburgh, they crowned  Charles King of Scotland in a venerable abbey there, the ancient place  of coronation for all the monarchs of the Scottish line.    In the mean time, Cromwell, who was at the head of the republican  government of England, knowing very well that Charles's plan would be  to march into England as soon as he could mature his arrangements for  such an enterprise, determined to anticipate this design by declaring  war himself against Scotland, and marching an army there.    Charles felt comparatively little interest in what became of Scotland.  His aim was England. He knew, or supposed that there was a very large  portion of the English people who secretly favored his cause, and he  believed that if he could once cross the frontier, even with a small  army, these his secret friends would all rise at once and flock to his  standard. Still he attempted for a time to resist Cromwell in Scotland,  but without success. Cromwell penetrated to the heart of the country,  and actually passed the army of Charles. In these circumstances, Charles  resolved to leave Scotland to its fate, and boldly to cross the English  frontier, to see what he could do by raising his standard in his  southern kingdom. The army acceded to this plan with acclamations. The  king accordingly put his forces in motion, crossed the frontier, issued  his manifestoes, and sent around couriers and heralds, announcing to  the whole population that their king had come, and summoning all his  subjects to arm themselves and hasten to his aid. This was in the  summer of 1651, the year after his landing in Scotland.    It certainly was a very bold and almost desperate measure, and the  reader, whether Monarchist or Republican, can hardly help wishing the  young adventurer success. The romantic enterprise was, however, destined  to fail. The people of England were not yet prepared to return to  royalty. Some few of the ancient noble families and country gentlemen  adhered to the king's cause, but they came in to join his ranks very  slowly. Those who were in favor of the king were called _Cavaliers_.  The other party were called _Roundheads_. Queen Henrietta Maria had  given them the name, on account of their manner of wearing their hair,  cut short and close to their heads all around, while the gay Cavaliers  cultivated their locks, which hung in long curls down upon their  shoulders. The Cavaliers, it turned out, were few, while the Roundheads  filled the land.    It was, however, impossible for Charles to retreat, since Cromwell was  behind him; for Cromwell, as soon as he found that his enemy had  actually gone into England, paused only long enough to recover from  his surprise, and then made all haste to follow him. The two armies  thus moved down through the very heart of England, carrying every  where, as they went, universal terror, confusion, and dismay. The whole  country was thrown into extreme excitement. Every body was called upon  to take sides, and thousands were perplexed and undecided which side  to take. Families were divided, brothers separated, fathers and sons  were ready to fight each other in their insane zeal, the latter for  the Parliament, the former for the king. The whole country was filled  with rumors, messengers, parties of soldiers going to and fro, and  troops of horsemen, with robberies, plunderings, murders, and other  deeds of violence without number, and all the other elements of  confusion and misery which arouse the whole population of a country  to terror and distress, and mar the very face of nature in time of  civil war. What dreadful struggles man will make to gain the pleasure  of ruling his fellow man! Along the frontiers of England and Wales  there flows the beautiful River Severn, which widens majestically at  its mouth, and passes by the Bristol Channel to the sea. One of the  largest towns upon this river is Worcester. It was in those days  strongly fortified. It stands on the eastern side of the river, with  a great bridge opposite one of the gates leading across the Severn in  the direction toward Wales. There are other bridges on the stream,  both above and below, and many towns and villages in the vicinity, the  whole presenting, at ordinary times, a delightful scene of industry  and peace.    Worcester is, perhaps, three hundred miles from the frontiers of  Scotland, on the way to London, though somewhat to the westward of the  direct route. Charles's destination was the capital. He pushed on,  notwithstanding the difficulties and disappointments which embarrassed  his march, until at last, when he reached the banks of the Severn, he  found he could"]]]
