And, as he had hoped, Miss Mabel Lorimer  _did_ ask what that silver-plate was stuck on to that bat for.    It is not to be wondered at that in the midst of these festivities such  trivialities as Lorimer's poem found no place in his thoughts. It was  not until the following day that he was reminded of it.    That Sunday was a visiting Sunday. Visiting Sundays occurred three  times a term, when everybody who had friends and relations in the  neighbourhood was allowed to spend the day with them. Pringle on such  occasions used to ride over to Biddlehampton, the scene of Farnie's  adventures, on somebody else's bicycle, his destination being the  residence of a certain Colonel Ashby, no relation, but a great friend  of his father's.    The gallant Colonel had, besides his other merits--which were  numerous--the pleasant characteristic of leaving his guests to  themselves. To be left to oneself under some circumstances is apt to be  a drawback, but in this case there was never any lack of amusements.  The only objection that Pringle ever found was that there was too much  to do in the time. There was shooting, riding, fishing, and also  stump-cricket. Given proper conditions, no game in existence yields to  stump-cricket in the matter of excitement. A stable-yard makes the best  pitch, for the walls stop all hits and you score solely by boundaries,  one for every hit, two if it goes past the coach-room door, four to the  end wall, and out if you send it over. It is perfect.    There were two junior Ashbys, twins, aged sixteen. They went to school  at Charchester, returning to the ancestral home for the weekend.  Sometimes when Pringle came they would bring a school friend, in which  case Pringle and he would play the twins. But as a rule the programme  consisted of a series of five test matches, Charchester _versus_  Beckford; and as Pringle was almost exactly twice as good as each of  the twins taken individually, when they combined it made the sides very  even, and the test matches were fought out with the most deadly  keenness.    After lunch the Colonel was in the habit of taking Pringle for a stroll  in the grounds, to watch him smoke a cigar or two. On this Sunday the  conversation during the walk, after beginning, as was right and proper,  with cricket, turned to work.    'Let me see,' said the Colonel, as Pringle finished the description of  how point had almost got to the square cut which had given him his  century against Charchester, 'you're out of the Upper Fifth now, aren't  you? I always used to think you were going to be a fixture there. You  are like your father in that way. I remember him at Rugby spending  years on end in the same form. Couldn't get out of it. But you did get  your remove, if I remember?'    'Rather,' said Pringle, 'years ago. That's to say, last term. And I'm  jolly glad I did, too.'    His errant memory had returned to the poetry prize once more.    'Oh,' said the Colonel, 'why is that?'    Pringle explained the peculiar disadvantages that attended membership  of the Upper Fifth during the summer term.    'I don't think a man ought to be allowed to spend his money in these  special prizes,' he concluded; 'at any rate they ought to be Sixth Form  affairs. It's hard enough having to do the ordinary work and keep up  your cricket at the same time.'    'They are compulsory then?'    'Yes. Swindle, I call it. The chap who shares my study at Beckford is  in the Upper Fifth, and his hair's turning white under the strain. The  worst of it is, too, that I've promised to help him, and I never seem  to have any time to give to the thing. I could turn out a great poem if  I had an hour or two to spare now and then.'    'What's the subject?'    'Death of Dido this year. They are always jolly keen on deaths. Last  year it was Cato, and the year before Julius Caesar. They seem to have  very morbid minds. I think they might try something cheerful for a  change.'    'Dido,' said the Colonel dreamily. 'Death of Dido. Where have I heard  either a story or a poem or a riddle or something in some way connected  with the death of Dido? It was years ago, but I distinctly remember  having heard somebody mention the occurrence. Oh, well, it will come  back presently, I dare say.'    It did come back presently. The story was this. A friend of Colonel  Ashby's--the one-time colonel of his regiment, to be exact--was an  earnest student of everything in the literature of the country that  dealt with Sport. This gentleman happened to read in a publisher's list  one day that a limited edition of _The Dark Horse_, by a Mr Arthur  James, was on sale, and might be purchased from the publisher by all  who were willing to spend half a guinea to that end.    'Well, old Matthews,' said the Colonel, 'sent off for this book.  Thought it must be a sporting novel, don't you know. I shall never  forget his disappointment when he opened the parcel. It turned out to  be a collection of poems. _The Dark Horse, and Other Studies in the  Tragic_, was its full title.'    'Matthews never had a soul for poetry, good or bad. _The Dark  Horse_ itself was about a knight in the Middle Ages, you know. Great  nonsense it was, too. Matthews used to read me passages from time to  time. When he gave up the regiment he left me the book as a farewell  gift. He said I was the only man he knew who really sympathized with  him in the affair. I've got it still. It's in the library somewhere, if  you care to look at it. What recalled it to my mind was your mention of  Dido. The second poem was about the death of Dido, as far as I can  remember. I'm no judge of poetry, but it didn't strike me as being very  good. At the same time, you might pick up a hint or two from it. It  ought to be in one of the two lower shelves on the right of the door as  you go in. Unless it has been taken away. That is not likely, though.  We are not very enthusiastic poetry readers here.'    Pringle thanked him for his information, and went back to the  stable-yard, where he lost the fourth test match by sixteen runs, owing  to preoccupation. You can't play a yorker on the leg-stump with a thin  walking-stick if your mind is occupied elsewhere. And the leg-stump  yorkers of James, the elder (by a minute) of the two Ashbys, were  achieving a growing reputation in Charchester cricket circles.    One ought never, thought Pringle, to despise the gifts which Fortune  bestows on us. And this mention of an actual completed poem on the very  subject which was in his mind was clearly a gift of Fortune. How much  better it would be to read thoughtfully through this poem, and quarry  out a set of verses from it suitable to Lorimer's needs, than to waste  his brain-tissues in trying to evolve something original from his own  inner consciousness. Pringle objected strongly to any unnecessary waste  of his brain-tissues. Besides, the best poets borrowed. Virgil did it.  Tennyson did it. Even Homer--we have it on the authority of Mr  Kipling--when he smote his blooming lyre went and stole what he thought  he might require. Why should Pringle of the School House refuse to  follow in such illustrious footsteps?    It was at this point that the guileful James delivered his insidious  yorker, and the dull thud of the tennis ball on the board which served  as the wicket told a listening world that Charchester had won the  fourth test match, and that the scores were now two all.    But Beckford's star was to ascend again. Pringle's mind was made up. He  would read the printed poem that very night, and before retiring to  rest he would have Lorimer's verses complete and ready to be sent in  for judgement to the examiner. But for the present he would dismiss the  matter from his mind, and devote himself to polishing off the  Charchester champions in the fifth and final test match. And in this he  was successful, for just as the bell rang, summoning the players in to  a well-earned tea, a sweet forward drive from his walking-stick crashed  against the end wall, and Beckford had won the rubber.    'As the young batsman, undefeated to the last, reached the pavilion,'  said Pringle, getting into his coat, 'a prolonged and deafening salvo  of cheers greeted him. His twenty-three not out, compiled as it was  against the finest bowling Charchester could produce, and on a wicket  that was always treacherous (there's a brick loose at the top end), was  an effort unique in its heroism.'    'Oh, _come_ on,' said the defeated team.    'If you have fluked a win,' said James, 'it's nothing much. Wait till  next visiting Sunday.'    And the teams went in to tea.    In the programme which Pringle had mapped out for himself, he was to go  to bed with his book at the highly respectable hour of ten, work till  eleven, and then go to sleep. But programmes are notoriously subject to  alterations. Pringle's was altered owing to a remark made immediately  after dinner by John Ashby, who, desirous of retrieving the fallen  fortunes of Charchester, offered to play Pringle a hundred up at  billiards, giving him thirty. Now Pringle's ability in the realm of  sport did not extend to billiards. But the human being who can hear  unmoved a fellow human being offering him thirty start in a game of a  hundred has yet to be born. He accepted the challenge, and permission  to play having been granted by the powers that were, on the  understanding that the cloth was not to be cut and as few cues broken  as possible, the game began, James acting as marker.    There are doubtless ways by which a game of a hundred up can be got  through in less than two hours, but with Pringle and his opponent  desire outran performance. When the highest break on either side is  six, and the average break two, matters progress with more stateliness  than speed. At last, when the hands of the clock both pointed to the  figure eleven, Pringle, whose score had been at ninety-eight since  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#15)"],[1,"the arms will have a steadier support.]    2. _Expiration_.--When we forcibly expel the air from our lungs, the  operation is reversed. We bend forward, draw in the walls of the abdomen,  and press the diaphragm upward, while the ribs are pulled downward,--all  together diminishing the size of the chest, and forcing the air outward.    Ordinary, quiet breathing is performed mainly by the diaphragm,--one  breath to every four beats of the heart, or eighteen per minute. (See p.  299.)    MODIFICATIONS OF THE BREATH.--_Sighing_ is merely a prolonged  inspiration followed by an audible expiration. _Coughing_ is a  violent expiration in which the air is driven through the mouth.  _Sneezing_ differs from coughing, the air being forced through the  nose. _Snoring_ is produced by the passage of the breath through the  pharynx when the tongue and soft palate are in certain positions.  [Footnote: The soft palate must have fallen back in such a manner as  nearly or quite to close the entrance to the nasal cavity from the throat,  and the tongue must also be thrown back so far as to leave only a narrow  opening between it and the soft palate. The noise is produced by the air  being forced either inward or outward through this opening. A snore  results also when, with a closed mouth, the air is forced between the soft  palate and the back wall of the pharynx into the nasal cavity. With deep  breathing, perhaps accompanied by a variation in the position of the soft  palate, a rattling noise may be heard in addition to the snoring, which is  due to a vibration of the soft palate.--F. A. FERNALD, in \"How we Sneeze,  Laugh, Stammer, and Sigh.\"--_Popular Science Monthly_, Feb., 1884.]  _Laughing_ and _crying_ are very much alike. The expression of  the face is necessary to distinguish between them. The sounds are produced  by short, rapid contractions of the diaphragm. _Hiccough_ is confined  to inspiration. It is caused by a contraction of the diaphragm and a  constriction of the glottis; the current of air just entering, as it  strikes the closed glottis, gives rise to the well-known sound.  _Yawning_, or _gaping_, is like sighing. [Footnote: The  usefulness of a yawn lies in bringing up the arrears, as it were, of  respiration, when it has fallen behindhand, either through fatigue or  close attention to other occupation. The stretching of the jaws and limbs  may also serve to equalize the nervous influence, certain muscles having  become uneasy on account of being stretched or contracted for a long  time.] It is distinguished by a wide opening of the mouth and a deep,  profound inspiration. Both processes furnish additional air, and therefore  probably meet a demand of the system for more oxygen. Frequently, however,  they are like laughing, sobbing, etc., merely a sort of contagion, which  runs through an audience, and seems almost irresistible.    THE CAPACITY OF THE LUNGS.--If we take a deep inspiration, and then  forcibly exhale all the air we can expel from the lungs, this amount,  which is termed the _breathing capacity_, will bear a very close  correspondence to our stature. For a man of medium height (five feet eight  inches) it will be about two hundred and thirty cubic inches, [Footnote:  Of this amount, one hundred cubic inches can be forced in only by an extra  effort, and is available for emergencies, or for purposes of training, as  in singing, climbing, etc. It is of great importance, since, if the  capacity of the lungs only equaled our daily wants, the least obstruction  would prove fatal.] or a gallon, and for each inch of height between five  and six feet there will be an increase of eight cubic inches. In addition,  it is found that the lungs contain about one hundred cubic inches which  can not be expelled, thus making their entire contents about three hundred  and thirty cubic inches, or eleven pints. The extra amount always on hand  in the lungs is of great value, since thereby the action of the air goes  on continuously, even during a violent expiration. In ordinary breathing,  only about twenty or thirty cubic inches (less than a pint) of air pass in  and out.    THE NEED OF AIR.--The body needs food, clothing, sunshine, bathing, and.  drink; but none of these wants is so pressing as that for air. The other  demands may be met by occasional supplies, but air must be furnished every  moment or we die. Now the vital element of the atmosphere is oxygen gas.  [Footnote: See \"Steele's Popular Chemistry,\" p. 30. The atmosphere  consists of one fifth oxygen and four fifths nitrogen. The former is the  active element; and the latter, the passive. Oxygen alone would be too  stimulating, and must be restrained by the neutral nitrogen. Separately,  either element of the air would kill us.] This is a stimulating, life-  giving principle. No tonic will so invigorate as a few full, deep breaths  of cold, pure air. Every organ will glow with the energy of the fiery  oxygen.    ACTION OF THE AIR IN THE LUNGS.--In the delicate cells of the lungs, the  air gives up its oxygen to the blood, and receives in turn carbonic-acid  [Footnote: More properly _Carbon dioxide_.] gas and water, foul with  waste matter which the blood has picked up in its circulation through the  body. The blood, thus purified and laden with the inspiring oxygen, goes  bounding through the system, while the air we exhale carries off the  impurities. In this process, the blood changes from purple to red. If we  examine our breath, we can readily see what it has removed from the blood.    TESTS OF THE BREATH.--1. Breathe into a jar, and on lowering into it a  lighted candle, the flame will be instantly extinguished; thus indicating  the presence of carbonic-acid gas. 2. Breathe upon a mirror, and a film of  moisture will show the vapor. [Footnote: There is a close relation between  the functions of the skin, the lungs, and the kidneys--the scavengers of  the body. They all carry off water from the blood, and when the function  of one of the three is, in this respect, interfered with, the others are  called upon to perform its functions. When the function of perspiration is  deranged, the lungs and kidneys are required to perform heavier duty, and  this may lead to disease (see p. 62).] 3. If breath be confined in a  bottle, the animal matter will decompose and give off an offensive odor.    ANALYSIS OF THE EXPIRED AIR shows that it has lost about twenty-five per  cent of its oxygen, and gained an equal amount of carbonic-acid gas,  besides moisture, and organic impurities. Our breath, then, is air robbed  of its vitality, and containing in its place a gas as fatal to life  [Footnote: Carbonic-acid gas can not be breathed when undiluted, as the  glottis closes and forbids its passage into the lungs. Air containing only  three or four per cent acts as a narcotic poison (MILLER), and a much  smaller proportion will have an injurious effect. The great danger,  however, lies in the organic particles constantly exhaled from the lungs  and the skin, which, it is believed, are often direct and active poisons.]  as it is to a flame, and effete matter which is disagreeable to the smell,  injurious to the health, and which may contain the germs of serious  disease.    THE EVIL EFFECT OF REBREATHING the air can not be overestimated. We take  back into our bodies that which has just been rejected. The blood  thereupon leaves the lungs, bearing, not the invigorating oxygen, but  refuse matter to obstruct the whole system. We soon feel the effect. The  muscles become inactive. The blood stagnates. The heart acts slowly. The  food is undigested. The brain is clogged. The head aches. Instances of  fatal results are only too frequent. [Footnote: During the English war in  India, in the eighteenth century, one hundred and forty-six prisoners were  shut up in a room scarcely large enough to hold them. The air could enter  only by two narrow windows. At the end of eight hours, but twenty-three  persons remained alive, and these were in a most deplorable condition.  This prison is well called \"The Black Hole of Calcutta.\"--Percy relates  that after the battle of Austerlitz, three hundred Russian prisoners were  confined in a cavern, where two hundred and sixty of them perished in a  few hours.--The stupid captain of the ship _Londonderry_, during a  storm at sea, shut the hatches. There were only seven cubic feet of space  left for each person, and in six hours ninety of the passengers were  dead.] The constant breathing of even the slightly impure air of our  houses can not but tend to undermine the health. The blood is not  purified, and is thus in a condition to receive the seeds of disease at  any time. The system uninspired by the energizing oxygen is sensitive to  cold. The pale cheek, the lusterless eye, the languid step, speak but too  plainly of oxygen starvation. In such a soil, catarrh, scrofula, and  kindred diseases run riot. [Footnote: One not very strong, or unable  powerfully to resist conditions unfavorable to health, and with a  predisposition to lung disease, will be sure, sooner or later, by partial  lung starvation and blood poisoning, to develop pulmonary consumption.  _The lack of what is so abundant and so cheap--good, pure air--is  unquestionably the one great cause of this terrible disease_.--BLACK'S  _Ten Laws of Health_.]    CONCERNING THE NEED FOR VENTILATION.--The foul air which passes off from  the lungs and through the pores of the skin does not fall to the floor,  but diffuses itself through the surrounding atmosphere. A single breath  will to a trifling but certain extent taint the air of a whole room.  [Footnote: This grows out of a well-known philosophical principle called  the Diffusion of Gases, whereby two gases tend to mix in exact  proportions, no matter what may be the quantity of each.--STEELE'S  _Popular Chemistry,_ p. 86, and _Popular Physics,_ p. 52.] A  light will vitiate as much air as a dozen persons.
