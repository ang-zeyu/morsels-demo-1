FRIEND.    It is astonishing that such wise men should disagree, and, with  regard to the same things, should not all be of the same opinion.    MENIPPUS.    You will laugh, my friend, when I shall tell you of their pride and  impudence in the relation of extraordinary events; to think that  men, who creep upon this earth, and are not a whit wiser, or can see  farther than ourselves, some of them old, blind, and lazy, should  pretend to know the limits and extent of heaven, measure the sun's  circuit, and walk above the moon; that they should tell us the size  and form of the stars, as if they were just come down from them;  that those who scarcely know how many furlongs it is from Athens to  Megara, should inform you exactly how many cubits distance the sun  is from the moon, should mark out the height of the air, and the  depth of the sea, describe circles, from squares upon triangles,  make spheres, and determine the length and breadth of heaven itself:  is it not to the last degree impudent and audacious?  When they talk  of things thus obscure and unintelligible, not merely to offer their  opinions as conjectures, but boldly to urge and insist upon them:  to do everything but swear, that the sun {161} is a mass of liquid  fire, that the moon is inhabited, that the stars drink water, and  that the sun draws up the moisture from the sea, as with a well-  rope, and distributes his draught over the whole creation?  How  little they agree upon any one thing, and what a variety of tenets  they embrace, is but too evident; for first, with regard to the  world, their opinions are totally different; some affirm that it  hath neither beginning nor end; some, whom I cannot but admire,  point out to us the manner of its construction, and the maker of it,  a supreme deity, whom they worship as creator of the universe; but  they have not told us whence he came, nor where he exists; neither,  before the formation of this world, can we have any idea of time or  place.    FRIEND.    These are, indeed, bold and presumptuous diviners.    MENIPPUS.    But what would you say, my dear friend, were you to hear them  disputing, concerning ideal {162} and incorporeal substances, and  talking about finite and infinite? for this is a principal matter of  contention between them; some confining all things within certain  limits, others prescribing none.  Some assert that there are many  worlds, {163a} and laugh at those who affirm there is but one;  whilst another, {163b} no man of peace, gravely assures us that war  is the original parent of all things.  Need I mention to you their  strange opinions concerning the deities?  One says, that number  {163c} is a god; others swear by dogs, {164} geese, and plane-trees.  Some give the rule of everything to one god alone, and take away all  power from the rest, a scarcity of deities which I could not well  brook; others more liberal, increased the number of gods, and gave  to each his separate province and employment, calling one the first,  and allotting to others the second or third rank of divinity.  Some  held that gods were incorporeal, and without form; others supposed  them to have bodies.  It was by no means universally acknowledged  that the gods took cognisance of human affairs; some there were who  exempted them from all care and solicitude, as we exonerate our old  men from business and trouble; bringing them in like so many mute  attendants on the stage.  There are some too, who go beyond all  this, and deny that there are any gods at all, but assert that the  world is left without any guide or master.    I could not tell how to refuse my assent to these high-sounding and  long-bearded gentlemen, and yet could find no argument amongst them  all, that had not been refuted by some or other of them; often was I  on the point of giving credit to one, when, as Homer says,                     \"To other thoughts,       My heart inclined.\" {165a}    The only way, therefore, to put an end to all my doubts, was, I  thought, to make a bird of myself, and fly up to heaven.  This my  own eager desires represented as probable, and the fable-writer  AEsop {165b} confirmed it, who carries up, not only his eagles, but  his beetles, and camels thither.  To make wings for myself was  impossible, but to fit those of a vulture and an eagle to my body,  might, I imagined, answer the same purpose.  I resolved, therefore,  to try the experiment, and cut off the right wing of one, and the  left of the other; bound them on with thongs, and at the extremities  made loops for my hands; then, raising myself by degrees, just  skimmed above the ground, like the geese.  When, finding my project  succeed, I made a bold push, got upon the Acropolis {166a} and from  thence slid down to the theatre.  Having got so far without danger  or difficulty, I began to meditate greater things, and setting off  from Parnethes or Hymettus {166b} flew to Geranea, {166c} and from  thence to the top of the tower at Corinth; from thence over Pholoe  {166d} and Erymanthus quite to Taygetus.  And now, resolving to  strike a bold stroke, as I was already become a high flyer, and  perfect in my art, I no longer confined myself to chicken flights,  but getting upon Olympus, and taking a little light provision with  me, I made the best of my way directly towards heaven.  The extreme  height which I soared to brought on a giddiness at first, but this  soon went off; and when I got as far the Moon, having left a number  of clouds behind me, I found a weariness, particularly in my vulture  wing.  I halted, therefore, to rest myself a little, and looking  down from thence upon the earth, like Homer's Jupiter, beheld the  places--         \"Where the brave Mycians prove their martial force,        And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;        Then India, Persia, and all-conquering Greece.\" {167}    which gave me wonderful pleasure and satisfaction.    FRIEND.    Let me have an exact account of all your travels, I beseech you,  omit not the least particular, but give me your observations upon  everything; I expect to hear a great deal about the form and figure  of the earth, and how it all appeared to you from such an eminence.    MENIPPUS.    And so you shall; ascend, therefore, in imagination with me to the  Moon, and consider the situation and appearance of the earth from  thence:  suppose it to seem, as it did to me, much less than the  moon, insomuch, that when I first looked down, I could not find the  high mountains, and the great sea; and, if it had not been for the  Rhodian Colossus, {168} and the tower of Pharos, should not have  known where the earth stood.  At length, however, by the reflection  of the sunbeams, the ocean appeared, and showed me the land, when,  keeping my eyes fixed upon it, I beheld clearly and distinctly  everything that was doing upon earth, not only whole nations and  cities, but all the inhabitants of them, whether waging war,  cultivating their fields, trying causes, or anything else; their  women, animals, everything, in short, was before me.    FRIEND.    Most improbable, all this, and contradictory; you told me but just  before, that the earth was so little by its great distance, that you  could scarce find it, and, if it had not been for the Colossus, it  would not have appeared at all; and now, on a sudden, like another  Lynceus, you can spy out men, trees, animals, nay, I suppose, even a  flea's nest, if you chose it.    MENIPPUS.    I thank you for putting me in mind of what I had forgot to mention.  When I beheld the earth, but could not distinguish the objects upon  it, on account of the immense distance, I was horribly vexed at it,  and ready to cry, when, on a sudden, Empedocles {169} the  philosopher stood behind me, all over ashes, as black as a coal, and  dreadfully scorched:  when I saw him, I must own I was frightened,  and took him for some demon of the moon; but he came up to me, and  cried out, \"Menippus, don't be afraid,         \"I am no god, why call'st thou me divine?\" {170}    I am Empedocles, the naturalist:  after I had leaped into the  furnace, a vapour from AEtna carried me up hither, and here I live  in the moon and feed upon dew:  I am come to free you from your  present distress.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said I, \"most noble  Empedocles, and when I fly back to Greece, I shall not forget to pay  my devotions to you in the tunnel of my chimney every new moon.\"  \"Think not,\" replied he, \"that I do this for the sake of any reward  I might expect for it; by Endymion, {171} that is not the case, but  I was really grieved to see you so uneasy:  and now, how shall we  contrive to make you see clear?\"  \"That, by Jove,\" said I, \"I cannot  guess, unless you can take off this mist from my eyes, for they are  horribly dim at present.\"  \"You have brought the remedy along with  you.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Have you not got an eagle's wing?\"  \"True, but  what has that to do with an eye?\"  \"An eagle, you know, is more  sharp-sighted than any other creature, and the only one that can  look against the sun:  your true royal bird is known by never  winking at the rays, be they ever so strong.\"  \"So I have heard, and  I am sorry I did not,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#16)"],[1,"conduct of affairs, in the practical and concrete relations  between individuals and governments, it doubtless exercises and should  exercise a measure of influence, but it is not a controlling influence.    In the Treaty of Versailles with Germany the readjustment of the German  boundaries, by which the sovereignty over millions of persons of German  blood was transferred to the new states of Poland and Czecho-Slovakia,  and the practical cession to the Empire of Japan of the port of  Kiao-Chau and control over the economic life of the Province of Shantung  are striking examples of the abandonment of the principle.    In the Treaty of Saint-Germain the Austrian Tyrol was ceded to the  Kingdom of Italy against the known will of substantially the entire  population of that region.    In both the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain Austria  was denied the right to form a political union with Germany, and when an  article of the German Constitution of August, 1919, contemplating a  \"reunion\" of \"German Austria\" with the German Empire was objected to by  the Supreme Council, then in session at Paris, as in contradiction of  the terms of the Treaty with Germany, a protocol was signed on September  22, 1919, by plenipotentiaries of Germany and the five Principal Allied  and Associated Powers, declaring the article in the Constitution null  and void. There could hardly be a more open repudiation of the alleged  right of \"self-determination\" than this refusal to permit Austria to  unite with Germany however unanimous the wish of the Austrian people for  such union.    But Mr. Wilson even further discredited the phrase by adopting a policy  toward Russia which ignored the principle. The peoples of Esthonia,  Latvia, Lithuania, the Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaidjan have by blood,  language, and racial traits elements of difference which give to each of  them in more or less degree the character of a distinct nationality.  These peoples all possess aspirations to become independent states, and  yet, throughout the negotiations at Paris and since that time, the  Government of the United States has repeatedly refused to recognize the  right of the inhabitants of these territories to determine for  themselves the sovereignty under which they shall live. It has, on the  contrary, declared in favor of a \"Great Russia\" comprising the vast  territory of the old Empire except the province which belonged to the  dismembered Kingdom of Poland and the lands included within the present  boundaries of the Republic of Finland.    I do not mention the policy of President Wilson as to an undivided  Russia by way of criticism because I believe the policy was and has  continued to be the right one. The reference to it is made for the  sole purpose of pointing out another example of Mr. Wilson's frequent  departure without explanation from his declared standard for the  determination of political authority and allegiance. I think  that it must be conceded that he has by his acts proved that  \"self-determination\" _is_ \"a mere phrase\" which ought to be discarded  as misleading because it cannot be practically applied.    It may be pointed out as a matter of special interest to the student of  American history that, if the right of \"self-determination\" were sound  in principle and uniformly applicable in establishing political  allegiance and territorial sovereignty, the endeavor of the Southern  States to secede from the American Union in 1861 would have been wholly  justifiable; and, conversely, the Northern States, in forcibly  preventing secession and compelling the inhabitants of the States  composing the Confederacy to remain under the authority of the Federal  Government, would have perpetrated a great and indefensible wrong  against the people of the South by depriving them of a right to which  they were by nature entitled. This is the logic of the application of  the principle of \"self-determination\" to the political rights at issue  in the American Civil War.    I do not believe that there are many Americans of the present generation  who would support the proposition that the South was inherently right  and the North was inherently wrong in that great conflict. There were,  at the time when the sections were arrayed in arms against each other,  and there may still be, differences of opinion as to the _legal_ right  of secession under the Constitution of the United States, but the  inherent right of a people of a State to throw off at will their  allegiance to the Federal Union and resume complete sovereignty over the  territory of the State was never urged as a conclusive argument. It was  the legal right and not the natural right which was emphasized as  justifying those who took up arms in order to disrupt the Union. But if  an American citizen denies that the principle of \"self-determination\"  can be rightfully applied to the affairs of his own country, how can he  consistently maintain that it is a right inseparable from a true  conception of political liberty and therefore universally applicable,  just in principle, and wise from the practical point of view?    Of course, those who subscribe to \"self-determination\" and advocate it  as a great truth fundamental to every political society organized to  protect and promote civil liberty, do not claim it for races, peoples,  or communities whose state of barbarism or ignorance deprive them of the  capacity to choose intelligently their political affiliations. As to  peoples or communities, however, who do possess the intelligence to make  a rational choice of political allegiance, no exception is made, so far  as words go, to the undeviating application of the principle. It is the  affirmation of an unqualified right. It is one of those declarations of  principle which sounds true, which in the abstract may be true, and  which appeals strongly to man's innate sense of moral right and to his  conception of natural justice, but which, when the attempt is made to  apply it in every case, becomes a source of political instability and  domestic disorder and not infrequently a cause of rebellion.    In the settlement of territorial rights and of the sovereignty to be  exercised over particular regions there are several factors which  require consideration. International boundaries may be drawn along  ethnic, economic, geographic, historic, or strategic lines. One or all  of these elements may influence the decision, but whatever argument may  be urged in favor of any one of these factors, the chief object in the  determination of the sovereignty to be exercised within a certain  territory is national safety. National safety is as dominant in the life  of a nation as self-preservation is in the life of an individual. It is  even more so, as nations do not respond to the impulse of  self-sacrifice. With national safety as the primary object to be  attained in territorial settlements, the factors of the problem assume  generally, though not always, the following order of importance: the  strategic, to which is closely allied the geographic and historic; the  economic, affecting the commercial and industrial life of a nation; and  lastly the ethnic, including in the terms such conditions as  consanguinity, common language, and similar social and religious  institutions.    The national safety and the economic welfare of the United States were  at stake in the War of Secession, although the attempt to secede  resulted from institutional rather than ethnic causes. The same was true  when in the Papineau Rebellion of 1837 the French inhabitants of the  Province of Lower Canada attempted for ethnic reasons to free themselves  from British sovereignty. Had the right of \"self-determination\" in the  latter case been recognized as \"imperative\" by Great Britain, the  national life and economic growth of Canada would have been strangled  because the lines of communication and the commercial routes to the  Atlantic seaboard would have been across an alien state. The future of  Canada, with its vast undeveloped resources, its very life as a British  colony, depended upon denying the right of \"self-determination.\" It was  denied and the French inhabitants of Quebec were forced against their  will to accept British sovereignty.    Experience has already demonstrated the unwisdom of having given  currency to the phrase \"self-determination.\" As the expression of an  actual right, the application of which is universal and invariable, the  phrase has been repudiated or at least violated by many of the terms of  the treaties which brought to an end the World War. Since the time that  the principle was proclaimed, it has been the excuse for turbulent  political elements in various lands to resist established governmental  authority; it has induced the use of force in an endeavor to wrest the  sovereignty over a territory or over a community from those who have  long possessed and justly exercised it. It has formed the basis for  territorial claims by avaricious nations. And it has introduced into  domestic as well as international affairs a new spirit of disorder. It  is an evil thing to permit the principle of \"self-determination\" to  continue to have the apparent sanction of the nations when it has been  in fact thoroughly discredited and will always be cast aside whenever it  comes in conflict with national safety, with historic political rights,  or with national economic interests affecting the prosperity of  a nation.    This discussion of the right of \"self-determination,\" which was one of  the bases of peace which President Wilson declared in the winter of  1918, and which was included in the modifying clause of his guaranty as  originally drafted, is introduced for the purpose of showing the  reluctance which I felt in accepting his guidance in the adoption of a  principle so menacing to peace and so impossible of practical  application. As a matter of fact I never discussed"]]]
