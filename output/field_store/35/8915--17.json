After he  has observed several instances of this nature, he then pronounces them  to be _connected._ What alteration has happened to give rise to this new  idea of _connexion?_ Nothing but that he now _feels_ these events to be  connected in his imagination, and can readily foretell the existence of  one from the appearance of the other. When we say, therefore, that one  object is connected with another, we mean only that they have acquired a  connexion in our thought, and give rise to this inference, by which they  become proofs of each other's existence: A conclusion which is somewhat  extraordinary, but which seems founded on sufficient evidence. Nor will  its evidence be weakened by any general diffidence of the understanding,  or sceptical suspicion concerning every conclusion which is new and  extraordinary. No conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than  such as make discoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of  human reason and capacity.    60. And what stronger instance can be produced of the surprising  ignorance and weakness of the understanding than the present? For  surely, if there be any relation among objects which it imports to us to  know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect. On this are founded all  our reasonings concerning matter of fact or existence. By means of it  alone we attain any assurance concerning objects which are removed from  the present testimony of our memory and senses. The only immediate  utility of all sciences, is to teach us, how to control and regulate  future events by their causes. Our thoughts and enquiries are,  therefore, every moment, employed about this relation: Yet so imperfect  are the ideas which we form concerning it, that it is impossible to give  any just definition of cause, except what is drawn from something  extraneous and foreign to it. Similar objects are always conjoined with  similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience,  therefore, we may define a cause to be _an object, followed by another,  and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects  similar to the second_. Or in other words _where, if the first object  had not been, the second never had existed_. The appearance of a cause  always conveys the mind, by a customary transition, to the idea of the  effect. Of this also we have experience. We may, therefore, suitably to  this experience, form another definition of cause, and call it, _an  object followed by another, and whose appearance always conveys the  thought to that other._ But though both these definitions be drawn from  circumstances foreign to the cause, we cannot remedy this inconvenience,  or attain any more perfect definition, which may point out that  circumstance in the cause, which gives it a connexion with its effect.  We have no idea of this connexion, nor even any distinct notion what it  is we desire to know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We say,  for instance, that the vibration of this string is the cause of this  particular sound. But what do we mean by that affirmation? We either  mean _that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that all  similar vibrations have been followed by similar sounds:_ Or, _that this  vibration is followed by this sound, and that upon the appearance of one  the mind anticipates the senses, and forms immediately an idea of the  other._ We may consider the relation of cause and effect in either of  these two lights; but beyond these, we have no idea of it.[16]        [16] According to these explications and definitions, the idea      of _power_ is relative as much as that of _cause;_ and both      have a reference to an effect, or some other event constantly      conjoined with the former. When we consider the _unknown_      circumstance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of      its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And      accordingly, it is allowed by all philosophers, that the effect      is the measure of the power. But if they had any idea of power,      as it is in itself, why could not they Measure it in itself?      The dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its      velocity, or the square of its velocity; this dispute, I say,      need not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or      unequal times; but by a direct mensuration and comparison.        As to the frequent use of the words, Force, Power, Energy, &c.,      which every where occur in common conversation, as well as in      philosophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any      instance, with the connecting principle between cause and      effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one      thing to another. These words, as commonly used, have very      loose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very      uncertain and confused. No animal can put external bodies in      motion without the sentiment of a _nisus_ or endeavour; and      every animal has a sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow      of an external object, that is in motion. These sensations,      which are merely animal, and from which we can _a priori_ draw      no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and      to suppose, that they have some such feelings, whenever they      transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are      exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of communicated      motion, we consider only the constant experienced conjunction      of the events; and as we _feel_ a customary connexion between      the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing      is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal      sensation, which they occasion.    61. To recapitulate, therefore, the reasonings of this section: Every  idea is copied from some preceding impression or sentiment; and where we  cannot find any impression, we may be certain that there is no idea. In  all single instances of the operation of bodies or minds, there is  nothing that produces any impression, nor consequently can suggest any  idea of power or necessary connexion. But when many uniform instances  appear, and the same object is always followed by the same event; we  then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion. We then  _feel_ a new sentiment or impression, to wit, a customary connexion in  the thought or imagination between one object and its usual attendant;  and this sentiment is the original of that idea which we seek for. For  as this idea arises from a number of similar instances, and not from any  single instance, it must arise from that circumstance, in which the  number of instances differ from every individual instance. But this  customary connexion or transition of the imagination is the only  circumstance in which they differ. In every other particular they are  alike. The first instance which we saw of motion communicated by the  shock of two billiard balls (to return to this obvious illustration) is  exactly similar to any instance that may, at present, occur to us;  except only, that we could not, at first, _infer_ one event from the  other; which we are enabled to do at present, after so long a course of  uniform experience. I know not whether the reader will readily apprehend  this reasoning. I am afraid that, should I multiply words about it, or  throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only become more  obscure and intricate. In all abstract reasonings there is one point of  view which, if we can happily hit, we shall go farther towards  illustrating the subject than by all the eloquence and copious  expression in the world. This point of view we should endeavour to  reach, and reserve the flowers of rhetoric for subjects which are more  adapted to them.        SECTION VIII.    OF LIBERTY AND NECESSITY.      PART I.      62. It might reasonably be expected in questions which have been  canvassed and disputed with great eagerness, since the first origin of  science and philosophy, that the meaning of all the terms, at least,  should have been agreed upon among the disputants; and our enquiries, in  the course of two thousand years, been able to pass from words to the  true and real subject of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to  give exact definitions of the terms employed in reasoning, and make  these definitions, not the mere sound of words, the object of future  scrutiny and examination? But if we consider the matter more narrowly,  we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From this  circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot, and  remains still undecided, we may presume that there is some ambiguity in  the expression, and that the disputants affix different ideas to the  terms employed in the controversy. For as the faculties of the mind are  supposed to be naturally alike in every individual; otherwise nothing  could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together; it were  impossible, if men affix the same ideas to their terms, that they could  so long form different opinions of the same subject; especially when  they communicate their views, and each party turn themselves on all  sides, in search of arguments which may give them the victory over their  antagonists. It is true, if men attempt the discussion of questions  which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity, such as those  concerning the origin of worlds, or the economy of the intellectual  system or region of spirits, they may long beat the air in their  fruitless contests, and never arrive at any determinate conclusion. But  if the question regard any subject of common life and experience,  nothing, one would think, could preserve the dispute so long undecided  but some ambiguous expressions, which keep the antagonists"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#15)"],[1,"is in fashion, as we know  very well, for people choose nowadays such Latin words as \"technical  ability,\" \"manual labor,\" \"industrial pursuits,\" \"dexterity,\"  \"professional artisanship,\" \"manufacture,\" \"decorative art,\" and  \"technological occupations,\" not one of which is half as good as the  plain, old, strong term \"hand-craft.\"    An aid to hand-craft is rede-craft--the power to read, to reason, and to  think; or, as it is said in the book of Common Prayer, \"to read, mark,  learn, and inwardly digest.\" By rede craft we find out what other men  have done; we get our book learning, we are made heirs to thoughts that  breathe and words that burn, we enter into the life, the acts, the arts,  the loves, the lore of the wise, the witty, the cunning, and the worthy  of all ages and all places; we learn, as says the peasant poet of  Scotland,      \"The song whose thunderous chime      Eternal echoes render--    The mournful Tuscan's haunted rhyme,      And Milton's starry splendor!\"    I do not pit rede-craft against hand-craft. Quite otherwise, I call them  not foes (as some would), but friends. They are brothers, partners,  consorts, who can work together, as right hand and left hand, as science  and art, as theory and practice. Rede-craft may call for books and  hand-craft for tools, but it is by the help of both books and tools that  mankind moves on. Indeed, we shall not err wide of the mark if we say  that a book is a tool, for it is the instrument which we make use of in  certain cases when we wish to find out what other men have thought and  done. Perhaps you will not be as ready to admit that a tool is a book.  But take for example the plow. Compare the form in use to-day on a  first-rate farm with that which is pictured on ancient stones long hid  in Egypt--ages old. See how the idea of the plow has grown, and bear in  mind that its graceful curves, it fitness for a special soil, or for  a special crop, its labor-saving shape, came not by chance, but by  thought. Indeed, a plow is made up from the thoughts and toils of  generations of plowmen. Look at a Collins ax; it is also the record  of man's thought. Lay it side by side with the hatchet of Uncas or  Miantonomoh, or with an ax of the age of bronze, and think how many  minds have worked on the head and on the helve, how much skill has been  spent in getting the metal, in making it hard, in shaping the edge, in  fixing the weight, in forming the handle. From simple tools, turn to  complex; to the printing press, the sewing machine, the locomotive,  the telegraph, the ocean steamer; all are full of ideas. All are the  offspring of hand-craft and rede craft, of skill and thought, of  practice put on record, of science and art.    Now, the welfare of each one of us, the welfare of our land, the welfare  of our race, rests on this union. You may almost take the measure of a  man's brain, if you can find out what he sees with his eyes and what he  does with hands; you may judge of a country, or of a city, if you know  what it makes.    I do not know that we need ask which is best, hand-craft or rede-craft.  Certainly \"the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee.\" At  times, hand-craft becomes rede-craft, for when the eye is blind the hand  takes its place, and the finger learns to read, running over the printed  page to find out what is written, as quickly as the eye.    In these days, there are too many who look down on hand-craft. They  think only of the tasks of a drudge or a char-boy. They do not know the  pleasure there is in working, and especially in making. They have never  learned to guide the fingers by the brain. They like to hear, or see, or  own, or eat, what others have made, but they do not like to put their  own hands to work. If you doubt what I say, put a notice in the paper  asking for a clerk, and you will have a, hundred answers for every one  that will come when you ask for a workman. So it comes to pass that  young men grow up whose hands have not been trained to any kind of  skill; they wish, therefore, to be buyers and sellers, traders, dealers,  and so the market is overstocked with clerks, book-keepers, salesmen,  and small shop-keepers, while it is understocked in all the higher walks  of hand-craft. Some men can only get on by force of arms, lifting,  pounding, heaving, or by power of sitting at counter or a desk and  \"clerking it.\"    Machinery works against hand-craft. In many branches of labor, the hand  now has but little to do, and that little is always the same, so that  labor becomes tiresome and the workman dull. Machines can be made to cut  statuary, to weave beautiful tapestry, to fashion needles, to grind  out music, to make long calculations; alas! the machine has also  been brought into politics. Of course, a land cannot thrive without  machinery; it is that mechanical giant, the steam engine, which carries  the corn, the cotton, and the sugar from our rich valleys to the hungry  of other lands, and brings back to us the product of their looms.  Nevertheless, he who lives by the machine alone lives but half a life;  while he who uses his hand to contrive and to adorn drives dullness from  his path. A true artist and a true artisan are one. Hand-craft, the  power to shape, to curve, to beautify, to create, gives pleasure and  dignity to labor.    In other times and in other lands, hand-craft has had more honor than it  has had with us. Let me give some examples. Not long ago, I went to one  of the shrines of education, the Sorbonne in Paris. Two paintings adorn  the chapel walls, not of saints or martyrs, nor of apostles or  prophets, perhaps I should say of both saints and prophets, _Labor_ and  _Humilitas_, Industry and Modesty.    The touch of Phidias was his own, and so inimitable that a few months  ago, an American, scanning, with his practiced eye, the galleries of the  Louvre, recognized a fragment of the work of Phidias, long separated  from the Parthenon frieze which Lord Elgin sent to London. The  sculptor's touch could not be mistaken. It was as truly his own as his  signature, his autograph. Ruskin, in a lecture on the relation of Art to  Morals, calls attention to a note which Durer made on some drawings sent  him by Raphael: \"These figures Raphael drew and sent to Albert Durer  in Nurnberg, to show him his hand, '_sein hand zu weisen_.\"' Ruskin  compares this phrase with other contests of hand-craft, Apelles and  Protogenes showing their skill by drawing a line; Giotto in striking a  circle.    In the household of the Kings of Prussia, there is a custom, if not  a law, that every boy shall learn a trade. I believe this is a fact,  though I have no certain proof of it. The Emperor Wilhelm is said to be  a glazier, the Crown Prince a compositor, and on the Emperor's birthday  not long ago his majesty received an engraving by Prince Henry and a,  book bound by Prince Waldemar, two younger sons of the Crown Prince. Let  me refer to sacred writ; the prophet Isaiah, telling of the golden days  which are to come, when the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in  the land, nor the voice of crying, when the child shall die an hundred  years old, and men shall eat of the fruit of the vineyards they have  planted, adds this striking promise, as the culm of all hope, that the  elect of the Lord shall long enjoy the work of their hands.    Now, in view of what has been said, my first point is this: We who have  to deal with the young, we all who love our fellow-men, we all who  desire that our times, our city, our country, should be thrifty, happy,  and content, must each in his place and way give high honor to labor.  We, especially, who are teachers and parents, should see to it that the  young get \"hand-craft\" while they are getting \"rede-craft.\" How can this  be done?    Mothers begin right in the nursery, teaching little fingers to play  before the tongue can lisp a sentence. Alas! this natural training has  often been stopped at school. Hitherto, until quite lately, in schools  both low and high, rede-craft has had the place of honor, hand-craft has  had no chance. But a change is coming. In the highest of all schools,  universities, for example, work rooms, labor places, \"laboratories,\" are  now thought to be as useful as book rooms, reading rooms, libraries.    What mean those buildings which you have seen spring up within a few  years past in all the college greens of New England? They are libraries  and laboratories. They show that rede-craft and hand-craft are alike  held in honor, and that a liberal education means skill in getting and  skill in using knowledge; that knowledge comes from searching books and  searching nature; that the brain and the hand are in close league. So  too, in the lowest school, as far as possible from the university, the  kindergarten has won its place and the blocks, and straws, and bands,  the chalk, the clay, the scissors, are in use to make young fingers  deft. Between the highest and the lowest schools there is a like call  for hand-craft. Seeing this need, the authorities in our public schools  have begun to project special schools for such training, and are looking  for guidance far and near. At this intermediate stage, for boy and girls  who are between the age of the kindergarten and the age of the college  or the shop, for youth between eight and sixteen, there is much to be  done; people are hardly aware how much is needed to secure fit training  for the rising generation.    It seems sometimes as if one of the most needed forms of hand-craft  would become a lost art, even good handwriting. We cannot give much  credit to schools if they send out many who are skilled in algebra, or  in Latin, but who cannot write a page of English so that it can be read  without effort.    Drawing is another kind of hand-craft, quite too much neglected. I think  it should be laid down as a law of the road to knowledge, that everybody  must learn to draw as well as to "]]]
