Alexia turned a deaf ear, and coolly read on, one arm around Polly.    \"Oh, girls--girls!\" she suddenly screamed, and jumping up, nearly  oversetting Polly, she raced over the remaining stairs to the bottom,  where she danced up and down the wide hall, \"Polly isn't going back--she  isn't--she isn't,\" she kept declaring.    \"What!\" cried all the girls. \"Oh, do stop, Alexia. What is it?\"    Meantime Cathie Harrison ran up and quickly possessed herself of the  vacated seat.    \"Why, Mr. Whitney writes to say that Polly needn't go back--oh, how  perfectly lovely in him!\" cried Alexia, bringing up flushed and panting.  \"Oh, dear me, I can't breathe!\"    \"Oh! oh!\" cried all the girls, clapping their hands.    \"But that doesn't mean that I shall not go back,\" said Polly, looking up  from her letter to peer through the stair-railing at them. \"I  think--yes, I really do think that I ought to go back.\"    \"How nonsensical!\" exclaimed Alexia impatiently. \"If Mr. Whitney says  you are not needed, isn't that enough? Beside he wrote it for Mrs.  Whitney; I read it all.\"    \"No, I don't think it is enough,\" answered Polly slowly, and turning the  letter with perplexed fingers, \"for I know dear Aunty only told him to  write because she thought I ought to be at home.\"    \"And so you ought,\" declared Alexia, very decidedly. \"She's quite right  about it, and now you're here, why, you've just got to stay. So there,  Polly Pepper. Hasn't she, girls?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" cried the girls.    Polly shook her brown head, as she still sat on her stair busily  thinking.    \"Here comes Mr. King,\" cried Cathie Harrison, suddenly craning her neck  at the sound of the opening of a door above them. \"Now I'm just going to  ask him,\" and she sprang to her feet.    \"Cathie--Cathie,\" begged Polly, springing up too.    \"I just will,\" declared Cathie, obstinately scampering up over the  stairs. \"Oh, Mr. King, mayn't Polly stay home? Oh, do say yes, please!\"    \"Yes, do say yes, please,\" called all the other girls in the hall below.    \"Hoity-toity!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, well pleased at the  onslaught. \"Now then, what's the matter, pray tell?\"    \"I just won't have Cathie Harrison tell him,\" said Alexia, trying to run  up over the stairs. \"Let me by, Polly, do,\" she begged.    \"No, indeed,\" cried Polly, spreading her arms. \"It's bad enough to have  one of you up there besieging Grandpapa.\"    \"Then I'll run up the back stairs,\" cried Alexia, turning in a flash.    \"Oh, yes, the back stairs!\" exclaimed the other girls, following her.  \"Oh, do hurry! Polly's coming after us.\"    But speed as she might, Polly could not overtake the bevy, who, laughing  and panting, stood before Mr. King a second ahead of her.    \"A pretty good race,\" said the old gentleman, laughing heartily, \"but  against you from the first, Polly, my girl.\"    \"Don't listen to them, Grandpapa dear,\" panted Polly.    \"Mayn't she stay at home--mayn't she?\"    \"Hush, girls,\" begged Polly. \"Oh, Grandpapa dear, don't listen to them.  Aunty told Uncle Mason to write the letter, and you know\"--    \"Well, yes, I know all you would say, Polly. But I've also had a letter  from Mason, and I was just going to show it to you.\" He pulled out of  his vest pocket another envelope corresponding to the one in Polly's  hand, which he waved at her.    \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Polly, quite aghast at his so easily going  over to the enemy. With that, all the girls deserted the old gentleman,  and swarmed around Polly.    \"See here, now,\" commanded Mr. King, \"every single one of you young  things come back here this minute. Goodness me, Polly, I should think  they'd be the death of you.\"    Polly didn't hear a word, for she was reading busily: \"Marian says  'don't let Polly come back on any account. It worries me dreadfully to  think of all that she is giving up; and I will be brave, and do without  her. She must not come back.'\"    Polly looked up to meet old Mr. King's eyes fixed keenly upon her.    \"You see, Polly,\" he began, \"I really don't dare after that to let you  go back.\"    \"Oh--oh--oh!\" screamed all the girls.    \"There, I told you so,\" exclaimed Alexia.          CHAPTER VIII.    POLLY LOOKS OUT FOR CHARLOTTE.      \"Second floor--Room No. 3,\" said Buttons, then stood like an automaton  to watch the tall young man scale the stair.    \"He did 'em beautifully,\" he confided afterward to another bell-boy.  \"Mr. King himself can't get over them stairs better.\"    \"Come in!\" cried Jasper, in response to the rap.    \"Halloo, old fellow!\" cried Pickering Dodge, rushing in tumultuously.  \"Well, well, so this is your den,\" looking around the small room in  surprise.    \"Yes. Now this is good to see you!\" exclaimed Jasper, joyfully leaping  from his chair to seize Pickering's hand. \"Well, what brought you?  There's nothing wrong?\" he asked, anxiously scanning Pickering's face.    \"No--that is, everything's right; all except Polly.\"    \"There isn't anything the matter with Polly?\" Jasper turned quite white,  scarcely speaking the words.    \"No, she's all right, only\"--Pickering turned impatiently off from the  chair Jasper pulled forward with a hasty hand, and stalked to the other  side of the little room. \"She's--she's--well, she's so hard to come at  nowadays. Everybody has a chance for a word with her but old friends.  And now the Recital is in full blast.\"    Jasper drew a long breath, and began to get his color again. \"Oh,  yes--well, it's all going on well, the Recital, I mean, isn't it?\" he  asked.    \"I believe so,\" said Pickering in a gloomy way. \"The girls are wild over  it; you can't hear anything else talked about at home. But,\" he broke  off abruptly, \"got a cigar, Jasper?\" and he began to hunt the mantel  among the few home-things spread around to enliven the hotel apartment.    \"Haven't such an article,\" said Jasper.    \"I forgot you don't smoke,\" said Pickering with a sigh. \"Dear me! how  will you bear trouble when it comes, old chap?\" He came back to the  table, and thrust his hands in his pockets, looking dismally at Jasper.    \"I'm afraid a cigar wouldn't help me much,\" said Jasper, with a laugh;  \"but if you must have one, I can get it, eh?\"    \"Yes, I must,\" said Pickering in despair, \"for I've something on my  mind. Came over on purpose to get your help, and I can't do it without a  weed.\"    \"Very well,\" said Jasper, shoving the chair again toward Pickering. \"Sit  down, and I'll have one sent up,\" and he went over and touched the  electric button on the wall.    \"Yes, sir?\" Buttons ran his head in the doorway, and stared at them  without winking.    \"A cigar for this gentleman,\" said Jasper, filliping a coin into the  boy's hand.    \"Is that the way you order cigars?\" demanded Pickering, whirling around  in his chair.    \"Yes, when I order them at all,\" said Jasper, laughing; \"a weed is a  weed, I suppose.\"    \"Indeed, and it is not, then,\" retorted Pickering. \"I'll have none of  your ordering. You needn't bring it up, boy; I'll go down to the office  and pick some out for myself.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said Buttons, putting down the coin on the table with  a lingering finger.    \"Keep it,\" said Jasper, with a smile.    \"He's a gentleman,\" observed Buttons, on the way downstairs, Pickering  treading his heels. \"He ain't like the rest of 'em that boards here.  They orders me around with a 'Here, you!' or a 'Hoi, there, boy!'  They're gents; he's the whole word--a first-class gentleman, Mr. King  is,\" he repeated.    \"Now, then, for it,\" said Jasper, when at last the gleam of Pickering's  cigar was steady and bright, \"open your budget of news, old fellow,\" he  added, with difficulty restraining his impatience.    \"It ought not to be any news,\" declared Pickering, with extreme  abruptness, \"for I've never tried to conceal it. I love Polly.\"    Jasper started so suddenly his arm knocked from the table a slender  crystal vase, that broke into a dozen pieces.    \"Never mind,\" he said, at Pickering's dismayed exclamation, \"go on.\"    Whew--puff! floated the rings of cigar smoke over Pickering's head. \"And  I can't stand it, and I won't, waiting any longer to tell her so. Why,  man,\" he turned savagely now on Jasper, \"I've loved her for years, and  must I be bullied and badgered out of my rights by men who have only  just been introduced to her--say?\"    \"Whom do you mean?\" asked Jasper huskily, his fingers working over the  table-cloth, under the pretense of pulling the creases straight.    \"Why, that Loughead chap,\" said Pickering, bringing his hand down  heavily on the table; \"he has more sweet words from Polly Pepper in a  week than I get in a month--and I such an old friend!\"    \"Polly is so anxious to help his sister,\" Jasper made out to say.    \"Well, that's no reason why the fellow should hang around forever,\"  declared Pickering angrily.    \"Why, he's gone abroad!\" exclaimed Jasper, \"long ago.\"    \"Ah, but he's coming back,\" said Pickering, with a sage nod, and  knocking off the ashes from his cigar end.    \"Is that so?\" cried Jasper, in astonishment.    \"Yes, 'tis,\" declared Pickering, nodding again, \"and I don't like it.  You know as well as I do,\" squaring around on Jasper, \"that he don't  care a rap about his sister's getting on; he's only thinking of Polly,  and _I_ love her.\"    Seeing that something was expected of him, Jasper made out to say, \"You  do?\"    \"Of course I do; and you know it, and every one knows it, or ought to; I  haven't ever tried to conceal it,\" said Pickering proudly.    \"How do you know that Loughead is coming back?\" asked Jasper abruptly.    \"How do I know? The best way in the world.\" Pickering moved uneasily in  his chair. \"Hibbard Crane had a letter yesterday; that's the reason I  threw my traps together and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#15)"],[1,"relics of an ancient race     That ne'er has had its day.\"    For four hundred years Bolivia has thus been held in chains by Romish  priestcraft. Since its Incan rulers were massacred, its civilization  has been of the lowest. Buildings, irrigation dams, etc., were suffered  to fall into disrepair, and the country went back to pre-Incan days.    The first Christian missionaries to enter the country were imprisoned  and murdered. Now \"the morning light is breaking.\" A law has been  passed granting liberty of worship.    Bolivia, with its vast natural riches, must come to the forefront, and  already strides are being taken forward. She can export over five  million dollars' worth of rubber in one year, and is now spending more  than fifty million dollars on railways. So Bolivia is a country of the  past and the future.          CHAPTER V.    JOURNEY TO \"THE UNEXPLORED LAKE.\"      Since the days when Pizarro's adventurers discovered the hitherto  undreamed-of splendor of the Inca Dynasty, Bolivia has been a land of  surprises and romantic discovery. Strange to say, even yet much of the  eastern portion of this great republic remains practically unexplored.  The following account of exploration in those regions, left for men of  the twentieth century, may not, I am persuaded, be without interest to  the general reader. Bolivia has for many years been seriously  handicapped through having no adequate water outlet to the sea, and the  immense resources of wealth she undoubtedly possesses have, for this  reason, been suffered to go, in a measure, unworked. Now, however, in  the onward progress of nations, Bolivia has stepped forward. In the  year 1900, the Government of that country despatched an expedition to  locate and explore Lake Gaiba, a large sheet of water said to exist in  the far interior of Bolivia and Brazil, on the line dividing the two  republics. The expedition staff consisted of Captain Bolland, an  Englishman; M. Barbiere, a Frenchman; Dr. Perez, Bolivian; M. Gerard  D'Avezsac, French artist and hunter, and the writer of these pages. The  crew of ten men was made up of Paraguayans and Argentines, white men  and colored, one Bolivian, one Italian, and one Brazilian. Strange to  relate, there was no Scotchman, even the ship's engineer being French.  Perhaps the missing Scotch engineer was on his way to the Pole, in  order to be found sitting there on its discovery by----(?)    The object of this costly journey was to ascend the rivers La Plata,  Paraguay and Alto Paraguay, and see if it were possible to establish a  port and town in Bolivian territory on the shores of the lake. After  some months of untiring energy and perseverance, there was discovered  for Bolivia a fine port, with depth of water for any ordinary river  steamer, which will now be known to the world as _Puerto Quijarro_. A  direct fluvial route, therefore, exists between the Atlantic and this  far inland point.    The expedition left Buenos Ayres, the capital of the Argentine  Republic. Sailing up the western bank of the River of Silver, we  entered the Parana River, and after an uneventful voyage of six days,  passed the mouth of the River of Gold, and turned into the Paraguay.    Three hundred miles up the Higher Parana, a mighty stream flowing from  the northeast, which we here left to our right, are the Falls of  Yguasu. These falls have been seen by few white men. The land on each  side of the river is infested by the Bugres Indians, a tribe of  cannibals, of excessively ferocious nature. The Falls of Big Water must  be the largest in the world--and the writer is well acquainted with  Niagara.    The river, over two and a half miles wide, containing almost as much  water as all the rivers of Europe together, rushes between  perpendicular cliffs. With a current of forty miles an hour, and a  volume of water that cannot be less than a million tons a minute, the  mighty torrent rushes with indescribable fury against a rocky island,  which separates it into two branches, so that the total width is about  two miles and a half. The Brazilian arm of the river forms a tremendous  horseshoe here, and plunges with a deafening roar into the abyss two  hundred and thirteen feet below. The Argentine branch spreads out in a  sort of amphitheatre form, and finishes with one grand leap into the  jagged rocks, more than two hundred and twenty-nine feet below, making  the very earth vibrate, while spray, rising in columns, is visible  several miles distant.    \"Below the island the two arms unite and flow on into the Parana River.  From the Brazilian bank the spectator, at a height of two hundred and  eighty feet, gazes out over two and a half miles of some of the wildest  and most fantastic water scenery he can ever hope to see. Waters  stream, seethe, leap, bound, froth and foam, 'throwing the sweat of  their agony high in the air, and, writhing, twisting, screaming and  moaning, bear off to the Parana.' Under the blue vault of the sky, this  sea of foam, of pearls, of iridescent dust, bathes the great background  in a shower of beauty that all the more adds to the riot of tropical  hues already there. When a high wind is blowing, the roar of the  cataract can be heard nearly twenty miles away. A rough estimate of the  horse-power represented by the falls is fourteen million.\"    Proceeding up the Paraguay River, we arrived at Asuncion, the capital  of Paraguay, and anchored in a beautiful bay of the river, opposite the  city. As many necessary preparations had still to be made, the  expedition was detained in Asuncion for fifteen days, after which we  boarded the S.S. _Leda_, for the second stage of our journey.    Steaming up the Alto Paraguay, we passed the orange groves of that  sunny land on the right bank of the river, and on the left saw the  encampments of the Tobas Indians, The dwellings of these people are  only a few branches of trees stuck in the ground. Further on, we saw  the Chamococos Indians, a fine muscular race of men and women, who  cover their bronze-colored bodies with the oil of the alligator, and  think a covering half the size of a pocket-handkerchief quite  sufficient to hide their nakedness. As we stayed to take in wood, I  tried to photograph some of these, our brothers and sisters, but the  camera was nothing but an object of dread to them. One old woman, with  her long, black, oily hair streaming in the breeze, almost withered me  with her flashing eyes and barbarous language, until I blushed as does  a schoolboy when caught in the act of stealing apples. Nevertheless, I  got her photo.    The Pilcomayo, which empties its waters into the Paraguay, is one of  the most mysterious of rivers. Rising in Bolivia, its course can be  traced down for some considerable distance, when it loses itself in the  arid wastes, or, as some maintain, flows underground. Its source and  mouth are known, but for many miles of its passage it is invisible.  Numerous attempts to solve its secrets have been made. They have almost  invariably ended disastrously. The Spanish traveller, Ibarete, set out  with high hopes to travel along its banks, but he and seventeen men  perished in the attempt. Two half-famished, prematurely-old, broken men  were all that returned from the unknown wilds. The Pilcomayo, which has  proved itself the river of death to so many brave men, remains to this  day unexplored. The Indians inhabiting these regions are savage in the  extreme, and the French explorer, Creveaux, found them inhuman enough  to leave him and most of his party to die of hunger. The Tobas and the  Angaitaes tribes are personally known to me, and I speak from  experience when I say that more cruel men I have never met. The  Argentine Government, after twenty years of warfare with them, was  compelled, in 1900, to withdraw the troops from their outposts and  leave the savages in undisputed possession. If the following was the  type of civilization offered them, then they are better left to  themselves: \"Two hundred Indians who have been made prisoners are  _compelled to be baptized_. The ceremony takes place in the presence of  the Governor and officials of the district, and a great crowd of  spectators. The Indians kneel between two rows of soldiers, an officer  with drawn sword compels each in turn to open his mouth, into which a  second officer throws a handful of salt, amid general laughter at the  wry faces of the Indians. Then a Franciscan padre comes with a pail of  water and besprinkles the prisoners. They are then commanded to rise,  and each receives a piece of paper inscribed with his new name, a  scapulary, and--_a glass of rum_\" [Footnote: Report of British and  Foreign Bible Society, 1900.] What countries these for missionary  enterprise!    After sailing for eighteen days up the river, we transhipped into a  smaller steamer going to Bolivia. Sailing up the bay, you pass, on the  south shore, a small Brazilian customs house, which consists of a  square roof of zinc, without walls, supported on four posts, standing  about two meters from the ground. A Brazilian, clothed only in his  black skin, came down the house ladder and stared at us as we passed.  The compliment was returned, although we had become somewhat accustomed  to that style of dress--or undress. A little farther up the bay, a  white stone shone out in the sunlight, marking the Bolivian boundary,  and giving the name of Piedra Blanca to the village. This landmark is  shaded by a giant tamarind tree, and numerous barrel trees, or _palo  boracho_, grow in the vicinity. In my many wanderings in tropical  America, I have seen numerous strange trees, but these are  extraordinarily so. The trunk comes out of the ground with a small  circumference, then gradually widens out to the proportions of an  enormous barrel, and at the top closes up to the two-foot circumference  again. Two branches, like giant arms spread themselves out in a most  weird-looking manner on the top of"]]]
