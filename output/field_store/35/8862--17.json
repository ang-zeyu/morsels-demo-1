For perhaps ten seconds I battled for my soul and the  purity of our love; then, tearing my sight from those eyes which would  lure an archangel to destruction, I was once more master of my body. As  my resolution grew, I hated her for doing this thing that had wrecked  in an instant the hopes of months, the ideals on which I had begun to  build afresh my life.    She felt the change, and left me.    As she went out by the door she gave me one last look, a look in which  love struggled with shame, a look which no man has ever earned the  right to receive from any woman.    But I was as a statue of marble, dazed by this calamity.    As the door closed upon her, I started forward--it was too late.    Had she waited another instant--but there, I write of what has happened  and not what might have been.    I did not sleep that night, until the dawn began to separate each fir  tree from the black mass of the forest. Twice in the night, with shame  I confess it, I opened my door and looked down the little passage-way;  and twice I closed the door and threw myself upon my bed in an agony of  torment. It was ten o'clock when a knock at the door aroused me, and  the sunlight through the window-pane was tracing patterns on the floor.    There was a note on the breakfast table, but before I opened it I knew  that, save for Babette, I was alone in the house.    The note was brief, unaddressed and unsigned. I have it here before me;  I have meant to tear it up but I cannot. It is a weakness to keep it,  but I have lost so much in the last few days, that I will not grudge  myself some small relic of what has been. The note says:    \"I am leaving for Bruges at half-past eight, when the car was ordered  to fetch us back. I go alone. Babette will give you breakfast. The car  will return for you at eleven o'clock. I rely on your honour in that  you will not observe where you have been. Come to me when you want  me--till then, farewell.\"    It was as she said, and I honourably acceded to her request. This  afternoon just before lunch I arrived in Bruges, and since tea-time I  have tried to write down what has happened since I left the day before  yesterday. Oh! how could she do it, how can it be possible that she is  a woman like that? I could have sworn that she was not like this--and  yet how can I account for her life with the Colonel? There must be some  reason, but in Heaven's name, what?    Meanwhile I am to go to her when I want her! And that will be when I  can give her my name. But oh! Zoe, I want you now, so badly, oh! so  badly!           *       *       *       *       *    I saw her once to-day in the gardens, walking by herself.           *       *       *       *       *    I have told Max's secretary that I want to get to sea; to be here in  Bruges and not to see her is more than I can bear.    I sail at dawn to-morrow. Shall I see her? No, it is best not.    A frightful noise over the New Year celebrations to-night. Champagne  flowing like water in the Mess. I feel the year 1917 opens badly for  me.    Weissman also went to sea again for a short trip in the Channel, and  has not reported for five days. Perhaps he has despised the Dover  Barrage once too often. If this is so, it is a great loss to the  service: he was a man of iron resolution in underwater attack.    I feel I ought to despise Zoe, but I can't. I love her too much; after  all, am I not perhaps encasing myself in the robe of a Pharisee?    She offered me all she had, save only the one thing I asked, without  which I will take nothing. I cannot reconcile her behaviour with her  character; why can't she trust me? why can't she be frank with me? I  will not believe she is that sort.    I feel I cannot go out again without a _sign_--I may not return, and I  will not leave her, perhaps for ever, with this bitterness between us.           *       *       *       *       *      At sea in U.C.47 again. Alten as surly as ever.    I decided finally to write to Zoe, but found it difficult to know what  to say. Eventually I said more than I had intended. I told her frankly  that I experienced a shock, but that I had not meant to seem so cold,  and that what I had done had been done for both our sakes. I told her  that I still loved her, and I implored her once more to leave the  Colonel and come to me as my wife.    Already I long to know what message awaits me on my return.    This will not be for three days. We left at dawn this morning to lay  mines off the channel to Harwich harbour; a nest from which submarines,  cruisers and destroyers buzz in and out like wasps. It will be ticklish  work.          _On the bottom_.      Our mines are still with us, but so are our lives, which is something.    We were approaching the appointed spot at 6 a.m. this morning, when  without the slightest warning the track of a torpedo was seen streaking  towards us about 50 yards on the starboard bow.    Before Alten (who was on the bridge with me) could do more than press  the diving alarm, the track met our ram. I breathed again, and was then  reminded by an oath from Alten that the boat was diving.    It was evident that we had only been saved by the torpedo running deep  under the cut-away part of our bow, otherwise!--well, the tangle of my  affairs would have been easily straightened.    Further procedure on the surface was suicidal, and we kept hydrophone  patrol, twice hearing the motors of the enemy submarine. At the moment  we are on the bottom waiting to come up and charge to-night, and lay  our mines at dawn to-morrow.           *       *       *       *       *    On the bottom in 28 metres and feeling none too comfortable, as there  would appear to be about a dozen destroyers overhead.    Last night, or rather early this morning, I participated in one of the  most extraordinary incidents that I have ever heard of.    It was pitch-black dark when I took over at 4 a.m., and a fresh breeze  had raised a lumpy sea, which covered the bridge with spray. We were  charging 400 amps on each, with the intention of laying one mine  directly there was sufficient light to get a fix from some of the buoys  which the English stick down all over the place here in the most  convenient manner possible. If only one could believe they never  shifted them. Alten says it never occurs to an Englishman to do a thing  like that, but I'm not so sure. However, we were proceeding along at  about five knots, crashing into the sea rather badly, when out of the  black beastliness of the night I saw a shape close aboard on the port  hand.    As I hesitated for a second as to my course of action, I was astounded  to see a large submarine which must have been British, on an opposite  course, not more than 25 metres away!    This sounds absurd, but it really wasn't further. I'm not ashamed to  confess that I was completely disorganized; it did not seem possible  that the enemy was literally alongside me.    I don't know how it struck the officer in the British boat, but I must  give him credit for doing something first, for he fired a Very's white  light straight at me as the two boats passed. It impinged on the hull,  and in the flash I caught a photographic glimpse of his conning tower,  on which was painted the letter E, followed by two numbers, of which  one was a two I think, and the other a nine.    By this time he was on my port quarter and rapidly disappearing; in a  frenzy of rage I managed to get my revolver out, and whilst with the  left hand I pressed the diving alarm, with the right hand I emptied the  magazine in his direction. When we were down, Alten practically  refused to believe me, which made me very pleased that in descending I  had trod on a pair of hands which turned out to be his, as he had  started up the ladder to the upper conning tower when he first heard  the alarm.    I presume our opponent dived as well, but evidently he had put two and  two together and used his aerial at some period, for when at dawn we  poked a periscope up, a flotilla of destroyers appeared to be looking  for something, which \"something\" was us, unless I am much mistaken; so  we bottomed, where we have been ever since. The Hydroplane Operator  keeps up a monotonous sing-song to the effect that \"Fast running  propellers are either receding or approaching.\" The crew are collected  round the mine-tubes as I write, and are singing a lugubrious song, the  refrain of which runs:      \"Death for the Fatherland! Glorious fate,    This is the end that we gladly await.\"    Why will the seamen always become morbid when possible? And there is  not a man amongst them who is not inwardly thinking of some beer-hall  in Bruges, though I suppose that like their betters they have their  romances of a tenderer kind.           *       *       *       *       *    The boat has been rolling about on the bottom in the most sickening  manner the whole afternoon. We flooded P and Q to capacity, which gave  her 50 tons negative, but it seems to have little effect in steadying  her, and it is evident that a really heavy gale is running on top.           *       *       *       *       *    Surfaced at 10 p.m.; a very heavy sea running and impossible to do much  more than heave to. This weather has one point in its favour and that  is that the destroyers are driven in.    It got steadily worse all night, and at midnight we lost our foremost  wireless mast overboard; we have now (10 a.m.) been 48 hours without  communication. At dawn we could see nothing to fix by; not a buoy in  sight, nothing but an expanse of foam-topped short steep waves of dirty  neutral-tinted water; how different to the great green and white surges  of the broad Atlantic.    Under these circumstances Alten decided to risk it and return without  laying our mines; for once in a way I agreed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#15)"],[1,"degraded.    Thus were the present commotions appeased; but others as great still  subsisted, from the rage and obstinacy of the fifth and twenty-first  legions. They were in winter quarters sixty miles off, in a place called  the Old Camp, [Footnote: Xanten.] and had first began the sedition: nor  was there any wickedness so horrid, that they had not perpetrated; nay,  at this time, neither terrified by the punishment, nor reclaimed by the  reformation of their fellow-soldiers, they persevered in their fury.  Germanicus therefore determined to give them battle, if they persisted  in their revolt; and prepared vessels, arms, and troops to be sent down  the Rhine.    Before the issue of the sedition in Illyricum was known at Rome, tidings  of the uproar in the German legions arrived; hence the city was filled  with much terror; and hence against Tiberius many complaints, \"that  while with feigned consultations and delays he mocked the Senate and  people, once the great bodies of the estate, but now bereft of power and  armies, the soldiery were in open rebellion, one too mighty and stubborn  to be quelled by two princes so young in years and authority: he  ought at first to have gone himself, and awed them with the majesty of  imperial power, as doubtless they would have returned to duty upon the  sight of their Emperor, a Prince of consummate experience, the sovereign  disposer of rewards and severity. Did Augustus, even under the pressure  of old age and infirmities, take so many journeys into Germany? and  should Tiberius, in the vigour of his life, when the same or greater  occasions called him thither, sit lazily in the Senate to watch senators  and cavil at words? He had fully provided for the domestic servitude  of Rome; he ought next to cure the licentiousness of the soldiers,  to restrain their turbulent spirits, and reconcile them to a life of  peace.\"    But all these reasonings and reproaches moved not Tiberius: he was  determined not to depart from the capital, the centre of power and  affairs; nor to chance or peril expose his person and empire. In truth,  many and contrary difficulties pressed and perplexed him: \"the German  army was the stronger; that of Pannonia nearer; the power of both the  Gauls supported the former; the latter was at the gates of Italy. Now to  which should he repair first? and would not the last visited be inflamed  by being postponed? But by sending one of his sons to each, the equal  treatment of both was maintained; as also the majesty of the supreme  power, which from distance ever derived most reverence. Besides, the  young princes would be excused, if to their father they referred such  demands as were for them improper to grant; and if they disobeyed  Germanicus and Drusus, his own authority remained to appease or punish  them: but if once they had contemned their Emperor himself, what other  resource was behind?\" However, as if he had been upon the point of  marching, he chose his attendance, provided his equipage, and prepared  a fleet: but by various delays and pretences, sometimes that of the  winter, sometimes business, he deceived for a time even the wisest men;  much longer the common people, and the provinces for a great while.    Germanicus had already drawn together his army, and was prepared to take  vengeance on the seditious: but judging it proper to allow space for  trial, whether they would follow the late example, and consulting their  own safety do justice upon one another, he sent letters to Caecina,  \"that he himself approached, with a powerful force; and if they  prevented him not, by executing the guilty, he would put all  indifferently to the slaughter.\" These letters Caecina privately read  to the principal officers, and such of the camp as the sedition had not  tainted; besought them \"to redeem themselves from death, and all  from infamy; urged that in peace alone reason was heard and merit  distinguished; but in the rage of war the blind steel spared the  innocent no more than the guilty.\" The officers, having tried those they  believed for their purpose, and found the majority still to persevere  in their duty, did, in concurrence with the General, settle the time for  falling with the sword upon the most notoriously guilty and turbulent.  Upon a particular signal given they rushed into their tents and  butchered them, void as they were of all apprehension; nor did any but  the centurions and executioners know whence the massacre began, or where  it would end.    This had a different face from all the civil slaughters that ever  happened: it was a slaughter not of enemies upon enemies, nor from  different and opposite camps, nor in a day of battle; but of comrades  upon comrades, in the same tents where they ate together by day, where  they slept together by night. From this state of intimacy they flew  into mortal enmity, and friends launched their darts at friends: wounds,  outcries, and blood were open to view; but the cause remained hid: wild  chance governed the rest, and several innocents were slain. For the  criminals, when they found against whom all this fury was bent, had also  betaken themselves to their arms; neither did Caecina, nor any of the  Tribunes, intervene to stay the rage; so that the soldiers had full  permission to vengeance, and a licentious satiety of killing. Germanicus  soon after entered the camp now full of blood and carcasses, and  lamenting with many tears that \"this was not a remedy, but cruelty  and desolation,\" commanded the bodies to be burnt. Their minds, still  tempestuous and bloody, were transported with sudden eagerness to attack  the foe, as the best expiation of their tragical fury: nor otherwise,  they thought, could the ghosts of their butchered brethren be appeased,  than by receiving in their own profane breasts a chastisement of  honourable wounds. Germanicus fell in with the ardour of the soldiers,  and laying a bridge upon the Rhine, marched over twelve thousand  legionary soldiers, twenty-six cohorts of the allies, and eight  regiments of horse; men all untainted in the late sedition.    The Germans rejoiced, not far off, at this vacation of war, occasioned  first by the death of Augustus, and afterwards by intestine tumults in  the camp; but the Romans by a hasty march passed through the Caesian  woods, and levelling the barrier formerly begun by Tiberius, upon  it pitched their camp. In the front and rear they were defended by a  palisade; on each side by a barricade of the trunks of trees felled.  From thence, beginning to traverse gloomy forests, they stopped to  consult which of two ways they should choose, the short and frequented,  or the longest and least known, and therefore unsuspected by the  foe: the longest way was chosen; but in everything else despatch was  observed; for by the scouts intelligence was brought that the Germans  did, that night, celebrate a festival with great mirth and revelling.  Hence Caecina was commanded to advance with the cohorts without their  baggage, and to clear a passage through the forest: at a moderate  distance followed the legions; the clearness of the night facilitated  the march, and they arrived at the villages of the Marsians, which with  guards they presently invested. The Germans were even yet under the  effects of their debauch, scattered here and there, some in bed, some  lying by their tables; no watch placed, no apprehension of an enemy. So  utterly had their false security banished all order and care; and they  were under no dread of war, without enjoying peace, other than the  deceitful and lethargic peace of drunkards.    The legions were eager for revenge; and Germanicus, to extend their  ravage, divided them into four battalions. The country was wasted by  fire and sword fifty miles round; nor sex nor age found mercy; places  sacred and profane had the equal lot of destruction, all razed to the  ground, and with them the temple of Tanfana, of all others the most  celebrated amongst these nations: nor did all this execution cost the  soldiers a wound, while they only slew men half asleep, disarmed, or  dispersed. This slaughter roused the Bructerans, the Tubantes, and the  Usipetes; and they beset the passes of the forest, through which the  army was to return: an event known to Germanicus, and he marched in  order of battle. The auxiliary cohorts and part of the horse led the  van, followed close by the first legion; the baggage was in the middle;  the twenty-first legion closed the left wing, and the fifth the right;  the twentieth defended the rear; and after them marched the rest of the  allies. But the enemy stirred not, till the body of the army entered  the wood: they then began lightly to insult the front and wings; and at  last, with their whole force, fell upon the rear. The light cohorts were  already disordered by the close German bands, when Germanicus riding up  to the twentieth legion, and exalting his voice, \"This was the season,\"  he cried, \"to obliterate the scandal of sedition: hence they should  fall resolutely on, and into sudden praise convert their late shame and  offence.\" These words inflamed them: at one charge they broke the enemy,  drove them out of the wood, and slaughtered them in the plain. In the  meanwhile, the front passed the forest, and fortified the camp: the rest  of the march was uninterrupted; and the soldiers, trusting to the merit  of their late exploits, and forgetting at once past faults and terrors,  were placed in winter quarters.    The tidings of these exploits affected Tiberius with gladness and  anguish: he rejoiced that the sedition was suppressed; but that  Germanicus had, by discharging the veterans, by shortening the term of  service to the rest, and by largesses to all, gained the hearts of the  army, as well as earned high glory in war, proved to the Emperor matter  of torture. To the Senate, however, he reported the detail of his feats,  and upon his valour bestowed"]]]
