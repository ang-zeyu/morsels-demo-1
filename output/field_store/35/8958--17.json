(#16)"],[1," flowers. The flowering period commences in May, and usually  extends to the end of July. This is a choice shrub of great hardihood,  and one of the handsomest flowering in cultivation. There is a still  more beautiful form named K. latifolia major splendens, and one with  small Myrtle-like foliage named K. latifolia myrtifolia.    The members of this handsome family are, as a rule, partial to cool,  damp soil, peat of a light, sandy nature being preferred. They thrive  well where Azaleas and Rhododendrons will succeed. In bold masses they  have a fine effect, but a well developed standard specimen of the  commonly cultivated species is highly ornamental.      KERRIA.    KERRIA JAPONICA (_syn Corchorus japonicus_).--Japan, 1700. A Japanese  shrub, the double-flowered variety of which, K. japonica flore-pleno, is  one of our commonest wall plants. The orange-yellow flowers, produced in  great rosettes, are highly ornamental, and have earned for the shrub a  well-known name. It succeeds well almost anywhere, and, though usually  seen as a wall plant, is perfectly hardy, and forms a neat shrub for the  open border. There is a form in which the leaves are variegated, and  known under the name of K. japonica variegata.      KOELREUTERIA.    KOELREUTERIA PANICULATA.--Northern China, 1763. Whether for its foliage  or flowers, this small-growing tree is worthy of a place. Though of  rather irregular growth, the beautiful foliage and large panicles of  yellowish flowers, which stand well above the leaves, make the shrub  (for it does not in this country attain to tree height), one of  particular interest, and a valuable aid in ornamental planting. In a  sheltered corner, and planted in rich soil, it grows and flowers freely.      LABURNUM.    LABURNUM ADAMI (_syn Cytisus Adami_).--A graft hybrid form between the  common Laburnum and Cytisus purpureus, the result being flowers of the  Laburnum, the true Cytisus purpureus, and the graft hybrid between the  two. It was raised by Jean Louis Adam in 1825. It is a curious and  distinct tree, worthy of culture if only for the production of three  distinct kinds of flowers on the same plant.    L. ALPINUM (_syn Cytisus alpinus_).--Scotch Laburnum. Europe, 1596. This  very closely resembles the common Laburnum, but it is of larger growth,  and flowers later in the season. The flowers, too, though in longer  racemes, are usually less plentifully produced. It grows 30 feet high.  There is a weeping form, L. alpinum pendulum, and another with fragrant  flowers, named L. alpinum fragrans, as also a third, with very long  racemes of flowers, named L. alpinum Alschingeri.    L. CARAMANICUM.--Asia Minor, 1879. A bushy shrub of vigorous habit, with  trifoliolate and petiolate leaves of a pale green colour, thick and  tough, and brightly polished on the upper surface. Flowers bright  yellow, the calyx being helmet-shaped and rusty-red. It is a beautiful  but uncommon shrub, and succeeds very well in chalky or calcareous soil.  Flowers in July.    L. VULGARE (_syn Cytisus Laburnum_).--Common Laburnum. Southern France  to Hungary, 1596. This is one of our commonest garden and park trees,  and at the same time one of the most beautiful and floriferous. The  large, pendulous racemes of bright yellow flowers are, when at their  best in May, surpassed neither in quantity nor beauty by those of any  other hardy tree. There are several varieties of this Laburnum--a few  good, but many worthless, at least from a garden point of view. L.  vulgare Parkesii is a seedling form, bearing large racemes of  deep-coloured flowers, often 14 inches long; L. vulgare Watereri was  raised in the Knap Hill Nursery, Surrey, and is one of the most distinct  and beautiful of the many forms into which the Laburnum has been  sub-divided. The flower racemes are very long and richly coloured. L.  vulgare quercifolium and L. vulgare sessilifolium are fairly well  described by their names; L. vulgare fragans differs only in having  sweetly-scented flowers; L. vulgare involutum has curiously-curled  leaves; while L. vulgare aureum, where it does well, is a beautiful and  distinct form.      LARDIZABALA.    LARDIZABALA BITERNATA.--Chili, 1848. Requires wall protection, there  being few situations in which it will succeed when planted in the open.  It is a tall, climbing shrub, with dark green persistent leaves, and  bearing purplish flowers in drooping racemes in mid-winter. Planted in  rather dry soil, at the base of a sunny wall, this shrub forms a by no  means unattractive covering, the twice ternate, glossy leaves being  fresh and beautiful the winter through.      LAPAGERIA.    LAPAGERIA ROSEA.--Chili, 1847. This is, unfortunately, not hardy, unless  in favoured maritime districts, but in such situations it has stood  unharmed for many years, and attained to goodly proportions. It is a  beautiful climber, with deep-green leaves, and large, fleshy,  campanulate flowers of a deep rose colour. There is a white-flowered  form called L. alba, introduced from Chili in 1854. Planted on an east  aspect wall, and in roughly broken up peat and gritty sand, it succeeds  well.      LAVANDULA.    LAVANDULA VERA (_syn L. Spica_).--Common Lavender. South Europe, 1568. A  well-known and useful plant, but of no particular value for ornamental  purposes. It is of shrubby growth, with narrow-lanceolate, hoary leaves,  and terminal spikes of blue flowers.      LAVATERA.    LAVATERA ARBOREA.--Tree Mallow. Coasts of Europe, (Britain). A  stout-growing shrub reaching in favourable situations a height of fully  6 feet, with broadly orbicular leaves placed on long stalks. The flowers  are plentiful and showy, of a pale purplish-red colour, and collected  into clusters. It is a seaside shrub succeeding best in sheltered  maritime recesses, and when in full flower is one of the most ornamental  of our native plants. There is also a beautiful variegated garden form,  L. a. variegata.      LEDUM.    LEDUM LATIFOLIUM (_syn L. groenlandicum_).--Wild Rosemary, or Labrador  Tea. This is a small shrub, reaching to about 3 feet in height,  indigenous to swampy ground in Canada, Greenland, and over a large area  of the colder parts of America. Leaves oval or oblong, and plentifully  produced all over the plant. Flowers pure white, or slightly tinted with  pink, produced in terminal corymbs, and usually at their best in April.  A perfectly hardy, neat-growing, and abundantly-flowered shrub, but one  that, somehow, has gone greatly out of favour in this country. This  plant has been sub-divided into several varieties, that are, perhaps,  distinct enough to render them worthy of attention. They are L.  latifolium globosum, with white flowers, borne in globose heads, on the  short, twiggy, and dark-foliaged branches. L. latifolium angustifolia  has narrower leaves than those of the species, while L. latifolium  intermedium is of neat growth and bears pretty, showy flowers.    L. PALUSTRE.--Marsh Ledum. This is a common European species, growing  from 2 feet to 3 feet high, with much smaller leaves than the former,  and small pinky-white flowers produced in summer. It is an interesting  and pretty plant. The Ledums succeed best in cool, damp, peaty soil.      LEIOPHYLLUM.    LEIOPHYLLUM BUXIFOLIUM (_syns L. thymifolia, Ammyrsine buxifolia_ and  _Ledum buxifolium_).--Sand Myrtle. New Jersey and Virginia, 1736. This  is a dwarf, compact shrub from New Jersey, with box-like leaves, and  bunches of small white flowers in early summer. For using as a rock  plant, and in sandy peat, it is an excellent subject, and should find a  place in every collection.      LESPEDEZA.    LESPEDEZA BICOLOR (_syn Desmodium penduliflorum_).--North China and  Japan. A little-known but beautiful small-growing shrub, of slender,  elegant growth, and reaching, under favourable culture, a height of  about 6 feet. The leaves are trifoliolate, small, and neat, and the  abundant racemes of individually small, Pea-shaped flowers are of the  richest and showiest reddish-purple. Being only semi-hardy will account  for the scarcity of this beautiful Japanese shrub, but having stood  uninjured in all but the coldest parts of these islands should induce  lovers of flowering shrubs to give it a fair chance.      LEUCOTHOE.    LEUCOTHOE AXILLARIS (_syn Andromeda axillaris_).--North America, 1765.  This is of small growth, from 2 feet to 3 feet high, with oval-pointed  leaves and white flowers in short racemes produced in May and June. It  is not a very satisfactory species for cultivation in this country.    L. CATESBAEI (_syns Andromeda Catesbaei_ and _A. axillaris_).--North  America. This has white flowers with an unpleasant odour like that of  Chestnut blossoms, but is worthy of cultivation, and succeeds best in  cool sandy peat or friable yellow loam.    L. DAVISIAE, from California (1853), is a very handsome evergreen shrub,  of small and neat growth, and will be found an acquisition where compact  shrubs are in demand. The leaves are small, of a deep green colour, and  remain throughout the year. Flowers produced in great abundance at the  branch tips, usually in dense clusters, and individually small and pure  white.    L. RECURVA (_syn Andromeda recurva_).--North America. A very distinct  plant on account of the branch tips being almost of a scarlet tint, and  thus affording a striking contrast to the grayish-green of the older  bark. The flowers are pinky-white and produced in curving racemes and  abundantly over the shrub. Like other members of the family it delights  to grow in cool sandy peat.      LEYCESTERIA.    LEYCESTERIA FORMOSA, from Nepaul (1824), is an erect-growing, deciduous  shrub, with green, hollow stems, and large ovate, pointed leaves of a  very deep green colour. The flowers are small, and white or purplish,  and produced in long, pendulous, bracteate racemes from the axils of  the upper leaves. It is one of the most distinct and interesting of  hardy shrubs, the"]]]
