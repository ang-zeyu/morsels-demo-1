According to Puck's story,  Wales was then a most distressful country, though the Welshery, to a  man, wanted to be good and loyal subjects of the Tudors.    Several times did Puck appeal to the owl, to have his story confirmed,  because this wise bird had lived among the Cymry, centuries before the  Normans came. The owl every time blinked, bowed, and answered  solemnly:    \"To whit, to who. To whit, to who,\" which in this case showed that she  had learned to speak the Court language.    \"Why, bless my soul, the owl speaks good Cockney Hinglish,\" whispered  one of the butlers, who had been born in Wales.    \"Yes, but that is the proper way to address His Majesty, King Ennery  the Heighth,\" answered the other butler, who was a native-born  Londoner.    Puck and the owl returned to Wales. What happened after that, is the A  B C of history, that everybody knows, and for which all the Welsh  people to this day bless the Tudors, who made the Welsh equal before  the law with any and all Englishmen. Even Puck himself had never seen  anything like the change that quickly took place for the better, nor  did Queen Mab, with her wand, ever work such wonders.    It was better than a fairy tale, and the effects, very soon seen, were  even more wonderful. Down went the castles into ruins, for rats to run  around in, and wild dogs to yelp and foxes to hide in, or look out of  the casements. To-day, what were once banqueting halls are covered  with moss, and on the ground grass grows, over which sheep graze and  children play; while rooks and crows nest or roost in the tall towers.    Any Englishman's life was safe anywhere, and Wales became one of the  most easily governed countries in all the wonderful British Empire.        And in the great world-war, that even children, who read these  stories, can remember, Wales, the Land of the Free, the Home of  Deathless Democracy, led all the British Isles, colonies, islands, or  coaling stations around the wide world, in loyalty, valor and  sacrifice. And the handsome son of the King, George, the Prince of  Wales, led the descendants of Welsh archers, now called the Fusileers.  They went into battle, singing, \"Old Land our Fathers before us held  so dear\"; or they marched, following the band that played \"The Men of  Harlech.\"    It is because Welsh cherish their traditions, harps, music, language  and noble inheritances, with which they feed their souls, that they  lead the four nations of the British Isles in the nobler virtues, that  keep a nation alive, as well as in the sweet humanities of the Red  Cross and in generous hospitality to the refugee Belgian. True to his  motto, \"I serve,\" the Prince of Wales who came to see us in 1919--as  did his grandfather, whom the story-teller saw when he visited our  Independence Hall in 1860--loved to be the servant of his people.    What was it that wrought this peaceful wonder of the sixteenth  century? Was it a fairy spell magic ointment, star-tipped wand,  treasures of caves, or ocean depths? Was it anything that dragons,  giants, ogres, or even swords, spears, catapults, or whips and clubs,  or elves or gnomes could do?    Not a bit of it! Only justice and kindness, instead of brutality and  force.          XV      THE WELSH FAIRIES HOLD A MEETING      In the ancient Cymric gatherings, the Druids, poets, prophets, seers,  and singers all had part. The one most honored as the president of the  meeting was crowned and garlanded. Then he was led in honor and sat in  the chair of state. They called this great occasion an Eistedfodd, or  sitting, after the Cymric word, meaning a chair.    All over the world, the Welsh folks, who do so passionately love  music, poetry and their own grand language, hold the Eistedfodd at  regular intervals. Thus they renew their love for the Fatherland and  what they received long ago from their ancestors.    Now it happens that the fairies in every land usually follow the  customs of the mortals among whom they live. The Swiss, the Dutch, the  Belgian, the Japanese and Korean fairies, as we all know, although  they are much alike in many things are as different from each other as  the countries in which they live and play. So, when the Welsh fairies  all met together, they resolved to have songs and harp music and make  the piper play his tunes just as in the Eistedfodd.    The Cymric fairies of our days have had many troubles to complain of.  They were disgusted with so much coal smoke, the poisoning of the air  by chemical fumes, and the blackening of the landscape from so many  factory chimneys. They had other grievances also.    So the Queen Mab, who had a Welsh name, and another fairy, called  Pwca, or in English King Puck, sent out invitations into every part of  Wales, for a gathering on the hills, near the great rock called Dina's  seat. This is a rocky chair formed by nature. They also included in  their call those parts of western and south England, such as are still  Welsh and spiritually almost a part of Wales. In fact, Cornwall was  the old land, in which the Cymry had first landed when coming from  over the sea.    The meeting was to be held on a moonlight night, and far away from any  houses, lest the merry making, dancing and singing of the fairies  should keep the farmers awake. This was something of which the yokels,  or men of the plow, often complained. They could not sleep while the  fairies were having their parties.    Now among the Welsh fairies of every sort, size, dress, and behavior,  some were good, others were bad, but most of them were only full of  fun and mischief. Chief of these was the lively little fellow, Puck,  who lived in Cwm Pwcca, that is, Puck Valley, in Breconshire.    Now it had been an old custom, which had come down, from the days of  the cave men, that when anyone died, the people, friends and relatives  sat up all night with the corpse. The custom arose, at first, with the  idea of protection against wild beasts and later from insult by  enemies. This was called a wake. The watchers wept and wailed at  first, and then fell to eating and drinking. Sometimes, they got to be  very lively. The young folks even looked on a wake, after the first  hour or two, as fine fun. Strong liquor was too plentiful and it often  happened that quarrels broke out. When heads were thus fuddled, men  saw or thought they saw, many uncanny things, like leather birds, cave  eagles, and the like.    But all these fantastic things and creatures, such as foolish people  talk about, and with which they frighten children, such as corpse  candles, demons and imps, were ruled out and not invited to the fairy  meeting. Some other objects, which ignorant folks believed in, were  not to be allowed in the company. The door-keeper was notified not to  admit the eagles of darkness, that live in a cave which is never  lighted up; or the weird, featherless bird of leather, from the Land  of Illusion and Phantasy, that brushes its wing against windows, when  a funeral is soon to take place; or the greedy dog with silver eyes.  None of these would be permitted to show themselves, even if they came  and tried to get in. Some other creatures, not recognized in the good  society of Fairyland, were also barred out.    To this gathering, only the bright and lively fairies were welcome.  Some of the best natured among the big creatures, and especially  giants and dragons, might pay a visit, if they wanted to do so; but  all the bad ones, such as lake hags, wraiths, sellers of liquids for  wakes, who made men drunk, and all who, under the guise of fairies,  were only agents for undertakers, were ruled out. The Night Dogs of  the Wicked Hunter Annum, the monster Afang, Cadwallader's Goats, and  various, cruel goblins and ogres, living in the ponds, and that pulled  cattle down to eat them up, and the immodest mermaids, whose bad  behavior was so well known, were crossed off the list of invitations.    No ugly brats, such as wicked fairies were in the habit of putting in  the cradles of mortal mothers, when they stole away their babies, were  allowed to be present, even if they should come with their mothers.  This was to be a perfectly respectable company, and no bawling,  squealing, crying, or blubbering was to be permitted.    When they had all gathered together, at the evening hour, there was  seen, in the moonlight, the funniest lot of creatures, that one could  imagine, but all were neatly dressed and well behaved.    Quite a large number of the famous Fair Family, that moved only in the  best society of fairyland, fathers, mothers, cousins, uncles and  aunts, were on hand. In fact, some of them had thought it was to be a  wake, and were ready for whatever might turn up, whether solemn or  frivolous. These were dressed in varied costume.    Queen Mab, who above all else, was a Welsh fairy, and whose name, as  everybody knows who talks Cymric, suggested her extreme youth and  lively disposition, was present in all her glory.    When they saw her, several learned fairies, who had come from a  distance, fell at once into conversation on this subject. One  remarked: \"How would the Queen like to add another syllable to her  name? Then we should call her Mab-gath (which means Kitten, or Little  Puss).\"    \"Well not so bad, however; because many mortal daddies, who have a  daughter, call her Puss. It is a term of affection with them and the  little girls never seem to be offended.\"    \"Oh! Suppose that in talking to each other we call our Queen Mab-gar,  what then?\" asked another, with a roguish twinkle in the eye.    \"It depends on how you use it,\" said a wise one dryly. This fairy was  a stickler for the correct use of every word. \"If you meant 'babyish,'  or 'childish,' she, or her friends might demur; but, if you use the  term 'love of children,' what better name for a fairy queen?\"    \"None. There could not be any,\" they shouted, all at once, \"but let us  ask"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#15)"],[1,"e--scow--an' de poor Rosie        Was corpses on de shore.

THE SHIPWRECK      Upon the poop the captain stands,        As starboard as may be;    And pipes on deck the topsail hands    To reef the topsail-gallant strands        Across the briny sea.      \"Ho! splice the anchor under-weigh!\"        The captain loudly cried;    \"Ho! lubbers brave, belay! belay!    For we must luff for Falmouth Bay        Before to-morrow's tide.\"      The good ship was a racing yawl,        A spare-rigged schooner sloop,    Athwart the bows the taffrails all    In grummets gay appeared to fall,        To deck the mainsail poop.      But ere they made the Foreland Light,        And Deal was left behind,    The wind it blew great gales that night,    And blew the doughty captain tight,        Full three sheets in the wind.      And right across the tiller head        The horse it ran apace,    Whereon a traveller hitched and sped    Along the jib and vanished        To heave the trysail brace.      What ship could live in such a sea?        What vessel bear the shock?    \"Ho! starboard port your helm-a-lee!    Ho! reef the maintop-gallant-tree,        With many a running block!\"      And right upon the Scilly Isles        The ship had run aground;    When lo! the stalwart Captain Giles    Mounts up upon the gaff and smiles,        And slews the compass round.      \"Saved! saved!\" with joy the sailors cry,        And scandalize the skiff;    As taut and hoisted high and dry    They see the ship unstoppered lie        Upon the sea-girt cliff.      And since that day in Falmouth Bay,        As herring-fishers trawl,    The younkers hear the boatswains say    How Captain Giles that awful day        Preserved the sinking yawl.                              _E.H. Palmer_.          _A SAILOR'S YARN_      _As narrated by the second mate to one of the marines_.      This is the tale that was told to me,    By a battered and shattered son of the sea:    To me and my messmate, Silas Green,    When I was a guileless young marine.      \"'T was the good ship 'Gyacutus,'    All in the China seas;    With the wind a lee, and the capstan free,    To catch the summer breeze.\"      \"'T was Captain Porgie on the deck    To the mate in the mizzen hatch,    While the boatswain bold, in the for'ard hold,    Was winding his larboard watch.\"      \"'Oh, how does our good ship head to-night?    How heads our gallant craft?'    'Oh, she heads to the E. S. W. by N.    And the binnacle lies abaft.'\"      \"'Oh, what does the quadrant indicate?    And how does the sextant stand?'    'Oh, the sextant's down to the freezing point    And the quadrant's lost a hand.'\"      \"'Oh, if the quadrant's lost a hand,    And the sextant falls so low,    It's our body and bones to Davy Jones    This night are bound to go.\"      \"'Oh, fly aloft to the garboard-strake,    And reef the spanker boom,    Bend a stubbing sail on the martingale    To give her weather room.\"      \"'Oh, boatswain, down in the for'ard hold    What water do you find?'    'Four foot and a half by the royal gaff    And rather more behind.'\"      \"'Oh, sailors, collar your marline spikes    And each belaying pin;    Come, stir your stumps to spike the pumps,    Or more will be coming in.'\"      \"'They stirred their stumps, they spiked the pumps    They spliced the mizzen brace;    Aloft and alow they worked, but, oh!    The water gained apace.\"      \"They bored a hole below her line    To let the water out,    But more and more with awful roar    The water in did spout.\"      \"Then up spoke the cook of our gallant ship--    And he was a lubber brave--    'I've several wives in various ports,    And my life I'd like to save.'\"      \"Then up spoke the captain of marines,    Who dearly loved his prog:    'It's awful to die, and it's worse to be dry,    And I move we pipes to grog.'\"      \"Oh, then 'twas the gallant second-mate    As stopped them sailors' jaw,    'Twas the second-mate whose hand had weight    In laying down the law.\"      \"He took the anchor on his back,    And leapt into the main;    Through foam and spray he clove his way,    And sunk, and rose again.\"      \"Through foam and spray a league away    The anchor stout he bore,    Till, safe at last, I made it fast,    And warped the ship ashore.\"      This is the tale that was told to me,    By that modest and truthful son of the sea.    And I envy the life of a second mate,    Though captains curse him and sailors hate;    For he ain't like some of the swabs I've seen,    As would go and lie to a poor marine.                              _J.J. Rache_.          THE WALLOPING WINDOW-BLIND      A capital ship for an ocean trip        Was the \"Walloping Window-blind\"--    No gale that blew dismayed her crew        Or troubled the captain's mind.    The man at the wheel was taught to feel        Contempt for the wildest blow,    And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared,        That he'd been in his bunk below.      The boatswain's mate was very sedate,        Yet fond of amusement, too;    And he played hop-scotch with the starboard watch,        While the captain tickled the crew.    And the gunner we had was apparently mad,        For he sat on the after rail,    And fired salutes with the captain's boots,        In the teeth of the booming gale.      The captain sat in a commodore's hat        And dined in a royal way    On toasted pigs and pickles and figs        And gummery bread each day.    But the cook was Dutch and behaved as such:        For the food that he gave the crew    Was a number of tons of hot-cross buns        Chopped up with sugar and glue.      And we all felt ill as mariners will,        On a diet that's cheap and rude;    And we shivered and shook as we dipped the cook        In a tub of his gluesome food.    Then nautical pride we laid aside,        And we cast the vessel ashore    On the Gulliby Isles, where the Poohpooh smiles,        And the Anagazanders roar.      Composed of sand was that favored land,        And trimmed with cinnamon straws;    And pink and blue was the pleasing hue        Of the Tickletoeteaser's claws.    And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge        And shot at the whistling bee;    And the Binnacle-bats wore water-proof hats        As they danced in the sounding sea.      On rubagub bark, from dawn to dark,        We fed, till we all had grown    Uncommonly shrunk,--when a Chinese junk        Came by from the torriby zone.    She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care,        And we cheerily put to sea;    And we left the crew of the junk to chew        The bark of the rubagub tree.                              _Charles E. Carryl_.          THE ROLLICKING MASTODON      A rollicking Mastodon lived in Spain,        In the trunk of a Tranquil Tree.    His face was plain, but his jocular vein        Was a burst of the wildest glee.    His voice was strong and his laugh so long        That people came many a mile,    And offered to pay a guinea a day        For the fractional part of a smile.          The Rollicking Mastodon's laugh was wide--          Indeed, 't was a matter of family pride;        And oh! so proud of his jocular vein          Was the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.      The Rollicking Mastodon said one day,        \"I feel that I need some air,    For a little ozone's a tonic for bones,        As well as a gloss for the hair.\"    So he skipped along and warbled a song        In his own triumphulant way.    His smile was bright and his skip was light        As he chirruped his roundelay.          The Rollicking Mastodon tripped along,          And sang what Mastodons call a song;        But every note of it seemed to pain          The Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.      A Little Peetookle came over the hill,        Dressed up in a bollitant coat;    And he said, \"You need some harroway seed,        And a little advice for your throat.\"    The Mastodon smiled and said, \"My child,        There's a chance for your taste to grow.    If you polish your mind, you'll certainly find        How little, how little you know.\"      The Little Peetookle, his teeth he ground        At the Mastodon's singular sense of sound;    For he felt it a sort of a musical stain        On the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.    \"Alas! and alas! has it come to this pass?\"        Said the Little Peetookle. \"Dear me!    It certainly seems your horrible screams        Intended for music must be!\"      The Mastodon stopped, his ditty he dropped,        And murmured, \"Good morning, my dear!    I never will sing to a sensitive thing        That shatters a song with a sneer!\"    The Rollicking Mastodon bade him \"adieu.\"        Of course 't was a sensible thing to do;    For Little Peetookle is spared the strain        Of the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.                              _Arthur Macy_.          THE SILVER QUESTION      The Sun appeared so smug and bright,        One day, that I made bold    To ask him what he did each night        With all his surplus gold.      He flushed uncomfortably red,        And would not meet my eye.    \"I travel round the world,\" he said,        \"And travelling rates are high.\"      With frigid glance I pierced him through.        He squirmed and changed his tune.    Said he: \"I will be frank with you:        I lend it to the Moon.\"      \"Poor thing! You know she's growing old        And hasn't any folk.    She suffers terribly from cold,   "]]]
