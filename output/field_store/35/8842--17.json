It seemeth to me that  this Empyre of Guiana is reserved for the English nation.\" (Raleigh  pages 7, 17, 51 and 100.)    The four voyages of Raleigh to the Lower Orinoco succeeded each other  from 1595 to 1617. After all these useless attempts the ardour of  research after El Dorado has greatly diminished. No expeditions have  since been formed by a numerous band of colonists; but some solitary  enterprises have been encouraged by the governors of the provinces.  The notions spread by the journeys of Father Acunha in 1688, and  Father Fritz in 1637, to the auriferous land of the Manoas of  Jurubesh, and to the Laguna de Ore, contributed to renew the ideas of  El Dorado in the Portuguese and Spanish colonies north and south of  the equator. At Cuenza, in the kingdom of Quito, I met with some men,  who were employed by the bishop Marfil to seek at the east of the  Cordilleras, in the plains of Macas, the ruins of the town of Logrono,  which was believed to be situate in a country rich in gold. We learn  by the journal of Hortsmann, which I have often quoted, that it was  supposed, in 1740, El Dorado might be reached from Dutch Guiana by  going up the Rio Essequibo. Don Manuel Centurion, the governor of  Santo Thome del Angostura, displayed an extreme ardour for reaching  the imaginary lake of Manoa. Arimuicaipi, an Indian of the nation of  the Ipurucotos, went down the Rio Carony, and by his false narrations  inflamed the imagination of the Spanish colonists. He showed them in  the southern sky the Clouds of Magellan, the whitish light of which he  said was the reflection of the argentiferous rocks situate in the  middle of the Laguna Parima. This was describing in a very poetical  manner the splendour of the micaceous and talcy slates of his country!  Another Indian chief, known among the Caribs of Essequibo by the name  El Capitan Jurado, vainly attempted to undeceive the governor  Centurion. Fruitless attempts were made by the Caura and the Rio  Paragua; and several hundred persons perished miserably in these rash  enterprises, from which, however, geography has derived some  advantages. Nicolas Rodriguez and Antonio Santos (1775 to 1780) were  employed by the Spanish governor. Santos, proceeding by the Carony,  the Paragua, the Paraguamusi, the Anocapra, and the mountains of  Pacaraymo and Quimiropaca, reached the Uraricuera and the Rio Branco.  I found some valuable information in the journals of these perilous  expeditions.    The maritime charts which the Florentine traveller, Amerigo Vespucci,*  constructed in the early years of the sixteenth century, as Piloto  mayor de la Casa de Contratacion of Seville, and in which he placed,  perhaps artfully, the words Tierra de Amerigo, have not reached our  times. (* He died in 1512, as Mr. Munoz has proved by the documents of  the archives of Simancas. Hist. del Nuevo Mundo volume 1 page 17.  Tiraboschi, Storia della Litteratura.) The most ancient monument we  possess of the geography of the New Continent,* is the map of the  world by John Ruysch, annexed to a Roman edition of Ptolemy in 1508.  (* See the learned researches of M. Walckenaer, in the Bibliographie  Universelle volume 6 page 209 article Buckinck. On the maps added to  Ptolemy in 1506 we find no trace of the discoveries of Columbus.) We  there find Yucatan and Honduras (the most southern part of Mexico)*  figured as an island, by the name of Culicar. (* No doubt the lands  between Uucatan, Cape Gracias a Dios, and Veragua, discovered by  Columbus (1502 and 1503), by Solis, and by Pincon (1506).) There is no  isthmus of Panama, but a passage, which permits of a direct navigation  from Europe to India. The great southern island (South America) bears  the name of Terra de Pareas, bounded by two rivers, the Rio Lareno and  the Rio Formoso. These Pareas are, no doubt, the inhabitants of Paria,  a name which Christopher Columbus had already heard in 1498, and which  was long applied to a great part of America. Bishop Geraldini says  clearly, in a letter addressed to Pope Leo X in 1516: Insula illa,  quae Europa et Asia est major, quam indocti Continentem Asiae  appellant, et alii Americam vel Pariam nuncupant [that island, larger  than Europe and Asia joined together, which the unlearned call the  continent of Asia, and others America or Paria].* (* Alexandri  Geraldini Itinerarium page 250.) I find in the map of the world of  1508 no trace whatever of the Orinoco. This river appears, for the  first time, by the name of Rio Dolce, on the celebrated map  constructed in 1529 by Diego Ribeyro, cosmographer of the emperor  Charles V, which was published, with a learned commentary, by M.  Sprengel, in 1795. Neither Columbus (1498) nor Alonzo de Ojeda,  accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci (1499), had seen the real mouth of the  Orinoco; they confounded it with the northern opening of the Gulf of  Paria, to which they attributed (by an exaggeration so common to the  navigators of that time, an immense volume of fresh water. It was  Vicente Yanez Pincon, who, after having discovered the mouth of the  Rio Maranon,* first saw, in 1500, that of the Orinoco. (* The name of  Maranon was known fifty-nine years before the expedition of Lopez de  Aguirre; the denomination of the river is therefore erroneously  attributed to the nickname of maranos (hogs), which this adventurer  gave his companions in going down the river Amazon. Was not this  vulgar jest rather an allusion to the Indian name of the river?) He  called this river Rio Dolce--a name which, since Ribeyro, was long  preserved on our maps, and which has sometimes been given erroneously  to the Maroni and to the Essequibo.    The great Lake Parima did not appear on our maps* till after the first  voyage of Raleigh. (* I find no trace of it on a very rare map,  dedicated to Richard Hakluyt, and constructed on the meridian of  Toledo. Novus Orbis, Paris 1587. In this map, published before the  voyage of Quiros, a group of Islands is marked (Infortunatae Insulae)  where the Friendly Islands actually are. Ortelius (1570) already knew  them. Were they islands seen by Magellan?) It was Jodocus Hondius who,  as early as the year 1599, fixed the ideas of geographers and figured  the interior of Spanish Guiana as a country well known. He transformed  the isthmus between the Rio Branco and the Rio Rupunuwini (one of the  tributary streams of the Essequibo) into the lake Rupunuwini, Parima,  or Dorado, two hundred leagues long, and forty broad, and bounded by  the latitudes of 1 degree 45 minutes south, and 2 degrees north. This  inland sea, larger than the Caspian, is sometimes traced in the midst  of a mountainous country, without communication with any river;* (*  See, for instance, Hondius, Nieuwe Caerte van het goudrycke landt  Guiana, 1599; and Sanson's Map of America, in 1656 and 1669.) and  sometimes the Rio Oyapok (Waiapago, Japoc, Viapoco) and the Rio de  Cayana are made to issue from it.* (* Brasilia et Caribaua, auct.  Hondio et Huelsen 1599.) The first of these rivers, confounded in the  eighth article of the treaty of Utrecht with the Rio de Vicente Pincon  (Rio Calsoene of D'Anville), has been, even down to the late congress  of Vienna, the subject of interminable discussions between the French  and Portuguese diplomatists.* (* I have treated this question in a  Memoire sur la fixation des limites de La Guyane Francaise, written at  the desire of the Portuguese government during the negotiations of  Paris in 1817. (See Schoell, Archives polit. or Pieces inedites volume  1 pages 48 to 58.) Ribeyro, in his celebrated map of the world of  1529, places the Rio de Vicente Pincon south of the Amazon, near the  Gulf of Maranhao. This navigator landed at this spot, after having  been at Cape Saint Augustin, and before he reached the mouth of the  Amazon. Herrera dec. I page 107. The narrative of Gomara, Hist. Nat.  1553 page 48, is very confused in a geographical point of view.) The  second is an imaginary prolongation either of the Tonnegrande or of  the Oyac (Wia?). The inland sea (Laguna Parime) was at first placed in  such a manner that its western extremity coincided with the meridian  of the confluence of the Apure and the Orinoco. By degrees it was  advanced toward the east,* the western extremity being found to the  south of the mouth of the Orinoco. (* Compare the maps of 1599 with  those of Sanson (1656) and of Blaeuw (1633).) This change produced  others in the respective situations of the lakes Parima and Cassipa,  as well as in the direction of the course of the Orinoco. This great  river is represented as running from its delta as far as beyond the  Meta, from south to north, like the river Magdalena. The tributary  streams, therefore, which were made to issue from the lake Cassipa,  the Carony, the Arui, and the Caura, then took the direction of the  latitude, while in nature they follow that of a meridian. Beside the  lakes Parima and Cassipa, a third was traced upon the maps, from which  the Aprouague (Apurwaca) was made to issue. It was then a general  practice among geographers to attach all rivers to great lakes. By  this means Ortelius joined the Nile to the Zaire or Rio Congo, and the  Vistula to the Wolga and the Dnieper. North of Mexico, in the  pretended kingdoms of Quivira and Cibola, rendered celebrated by the  falsehoods of the monk Marcos de Niza, a great inland sea was  imagined, from which the Rio Colorado of California was made to  issue.* (* This is the Mexican Dorado, where it was pretended that  vessels had been found on the coasts [of New Albion?] loaded with the  merchandise of Catayo and China (Gomara, Hist. Gen. page 117), and  where Fray Marcos (like Huten in the country of the Omaguas) had seen  from afar the gilded roofs of a great town, one of the Siete Ciudades.  The inhabitants have great dogs, en los quales quando se mudan cargan  su menage. (Herrera dec."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#15)"],[1," we accept what you say about  'manifestation.' Neither the ahamkâra, you say, nor Intelligence is  really a knowing subject, but the ahamkâra manifests consciousness  abiding within itself (within the ahamkâra), as the mirror manifests the  image abiding within it. But the essentially non-intelligent ahamkâra  evidently cannot 'manifest' the self-luminous Self. As has been said  'That the non-intelligent ahamkâra should manifest the self-luminous  Self, has no more sense than to say that a spent coal manifests the Sun.'  The truth is that all things depend for their proof on self-luminous  consciousness; and now you maintain that one of these things, viz. the  non-intelligent ahamkâra--which itself depends for its light on  consciousness--manifests consciousness, whose essential light never  rises or sets, and which is the cause that proves everything! Whoever  knows the nature of the Self will justly deride such a view! The  relation of 'manifestation' cannot hold good between consciousness and  the ahamkâra for the further reason also that there is a contradiction  in nature between the two, and because it would imply consciousness not  to be consciousness. As has been said, 'One cannot manifest the other,  owing to contradictoriness; and if the Self were something to be  manifested, that would imply its being non-intelligent like a jar.' Nor  is the matter improved by your introducing the hand and the sunbeams  (above, p. 38), and to say that as the sunbeams while manifesting the  hand, are at the same time manifested by the hand, so consciousness,  while manifesting the ahamkâra, is at the same time itself manifested by  the latter. The sunbeams are in reality not manifested by the hand at  all. What takes place is that the motion of the sunbeams is reversed  (reflected) by the opposed hand; they thus become more numerous, and  hence are perceived more clearly; but this is due altogether to the  multitude of beams, not to any manifesting power on the part of the hand.    What could, moreover, be the nature of that 'manifestation' of the Self  consisting of Intelligence, which would be effected through the ahamkâra?  It cannot be origination; for you acknowledge that what is self-  established cannot be originated by anything else. Nor can it be  'illumination' (making to shine forth), since consciousness cannot--  according to you--be the object of another consciousness. For the same  reason it cannot be any action assisting the means of being conscious of  consciousness. For such helpful action could be of two kinds only. It  would either be such as to cause the connexion of the object to be known  with the sense-organs; as e.g. any action which, in the case of the  apprehension of a species or of one's own face, causes connexion between  the organ of sight and an individual of the species, or a looking-glass.  Or it would be such as to remove some obstructive impurity in the mind  of the knowing person; of this kind is the action of calmness and self-  restraint with reference to scripture which is the means of apprehending  the highest reality. Moreover, even if it were admitted that  consciousness may be an object of consciousness, it could not be  maintained that the 'I' assists the means whereby that consciousness is  effected. For if it did so, it could only be in the way of removing any  obstacles impeding the origination of such consciousness; analogous to  the way in which a lamp assists the eye by dispelling the darkness which  impedes the origination of the apprehension of colour. But in the case  under discussion we are unable to imagine such obstacles. There is  nothing pertaining to consciousness which obstructs the origination of  the knowledge of consciousness and which could be removed by the  ahamkâra.--There is something, you will perhaps reply, viz. Nescience!  Not so, we reply. That Nescience is removed by the ahamkâra cannot be  admitted; knowledge alone can put an end to Nescience. Nor can  consciousness be the abode of Nescience, because in that case Nescience  would have the same abode and the same object as knowledge.    In pure knowledge where there is no knowing subject and no object of  knowledge--the so-called 'witnessing' principle (sâkshin)--Nescience  cannot exist. Jars and similar things cannot be the abode of Nescience  because there is no possibility of their being the abode of knowledge,  and for the same reason pure knowledge also cannot be the abode of  Nescience. And even if consciousness were admitted to be the abode of  Nescience, it could not be the object of knowledge; for consciousness  being viewed as the Self cannot be the object of knowledge, and hence  knowledge cannot terminate the Nescience abiding within consciousness.  For knowledge puts an end to Nescience only with regard to its own  objects, as in the case of the snake-rope. And the consequence of this  would be that the Nescience attached to consciousness could never be  destroyed by any one.--If Nescience, we further remark, is viewed as  that which can be defined neither as Being nor non-Being, we shall show  later on that such Nescience is something quite incomprehensible.--On  the other hand, Nescience, if understood to be the antecedent non-  existence of knowledge, is not opposed in nature to the origination of  knowledge, and hence the dispelling of Nescience cannot be viewed as  promoting the means of the knowledge of the Self.--From all this it  follows that the ahamkâra cannot effect in any way 'manifestation of  consciousness.'    Nor (to finish up this point) can it be said that it is the essential  nature of manifesting agents to manifest things in so far as the latter  have their abode in the former; for such a relation is not observed in  the case of lamps and the like (which manifest what lies outside them).  The essential nature of manifesting agents rather lies therein that they  promote the knowledge of things as they really are, and this is also the  nature of whatever promotes knowledge and the means thereof. Nor is it  even true that the mirror manifests the face. The mirror is only the  cause of a certain irregularity, viz. the reversion of the ocular rays  of light, and to this irregularity there is due the appearance of the  face within the mirror; but the manifesting agent is the light only. And  it is evident that the ahamkâra is not capable of producing an  irregularity (analogous to that produced by the mirror) in consciousness  which is self-luminous.--And--with regard to the second analogous  instance alleged by you--the fact is that the species is known through  the individual because the latter is its substrate (as expressed in the  general principle, 'the species is the form of the individual'), but not  because the individual 'manifests' the species. Thus there is no reason,  either real or springing from some imperfection, why the consciousness  of consciousness should be brought about by its abiding in the ahamkâra,  and the attribute of being the knowing agent or the consciousness of  that cannot therefore belong to the ahamkâra. Hence, what constitutes  the inward Self is not pure consciousness but the 'I' which proves  itself as the knowing subject. In the absence of egoity, 'inwardness'  could not be established for consciousness.          The conscious subject persists in deep sleep.    We now come to the question as to the nature of deep sleep. In deep  sleep the quality of darkness prevails in the mind and there is no  consciousness of outward things, and thus there is no distinct and clear  presentation of the 'I'; but all the same the Self somehow presents  itself up to the time of waking in the one form of the 'I,' and the  latter cannot therefore be said to be absent. Pure consciousness assumed  by you (to manifest itself in deep sleep) is really in no better case;  for a person risen from deep sleep never represents to himself his  state of consciousness during sleep in the form, 'I was pure  consciousness free from all egoity and opposed in nature to everything  else, witnessing Nescience'; what he thinks is only 'I slept well.' From  this form of reflection it appears that even during sleep the Self. i.e.  the 'I,' was a knowing subject and perceptive of pleasure. Nor must you  urge against this that the reflection has the following form: 'As now I  feel pleasure, so I slept then also'; for the reflection is distinctly  _not_ of that kind. [FOOTNOTE 68:1] Nor must you say that owing to the  non-permanency of the 'I' its perception of pleasure during sleep  cannot connect itself with the waking state. For (the 'I' is permanent  as appears from the fact that) the person who has risen from sleep  recalls things of which he was conscious before his sleep, 'I did such  and such a thing,' 'I observed this or that,' 'I said so or so.'--But,  you will perhaps say, he also reflects, 'For such and such a time I was  conscious of nothing!'--'And what does this imply?' we ask.--'It implies  a negation of everything!'--By no means, we rejoin. The words 'I was  conscious' show that the knowing 'I' persisted, and that hence what is  negated is only the objects of knowledge. If the negation implied in 'of  nothing' included everything, it would also negative the pure  consciousness which you hold to persist in deep sleep. In the judgment  'I was conscious of nothing,' the word 'I' clearly refers to the 'I,' i.  e. the knowing Self which persists even during deep sleep, while the  words 'was conscious of nothing' negative all knowledge on the part of  that 'I'; if, now, in the face of this, you undertake to prove by means  of this very judgment that knowledge--which is expressly denied--existed  at the time, and that the persisting knowing Self did not exist, you may  address your proof to the patient gods who give no reply!--But--our  opponent goes on to urge--I form the following judgment also: 'I then  was not conscious of myself,' and from this I understand"]]]
