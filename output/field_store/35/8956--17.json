As I have since been on the spot, I am sorry to say  that it is not at all like the place, because it obliges me to reject the  only praise Sir Thomas Mitchell ever gave me.\"    Sturt's original sketch of the junction had been lost, and Sturt, who was  nearly blind at the time of publication, obtained the assistance of a  friend, who drew it from his verbal description.    7.2. THE UPPER DARLING.    Rumours of a mysterious river called the Kindur, which was said, on no  better authority than a runaway convict's, to pursue a north-west course  through Australia, now began to be noised about. This convict, whose name  was Clarke, but who was generally known as the Barber, said that he had  taken to the bush in the neighbourhood of the Liverpool Plains, and had  followed down a river which the natives called the Gnamoi. He crossed it  and came next to the Kindur. This he followed down for four hundred miles  before he came upon the junction of the two. The union of the two formed  a broad navigable river, which he still followed, although he had lost  his reckoning, and did not know whether he had travelled five hundred or  five thousand miles. One thing, however, he was convinced of, and that  was that he had never travelled south of west. He asserted that he had a  good view of the sea, from the mouth of this most desirable river, and  had seen a large island from which, so the natives reported, there came  copper-coloured men in large canoes to take away scented wood. The Kindur  ran through immense plains, and past a burning mountain. As no one had  invited him to stay in this delectable country, he had returned.    The story, which bore every evidence of having been invented to save his  back, received a certain amount of credence, and Sir Patrick Lindesay,  then Acting-Governor, gave the Surveyor-General instructions to  investigate the truth of it. It was in this way that Mitchell's first  expedition originated.    On the 21st of November, 1831, Mitchell left Liverpool Plains and reached  the Namoi on the 16th December. He crossed it and penetrated some  distance into a range which he named the Nundawar Range. He then turned  back to the Namoi, and set up some canvas boats which he had brought to  assist him in following the river down. The boats were of no use for the  purpose, one of them getting snagged immediately, and it was clear that  it would be easier to follow the river on land. As the range was not easy  of ascent, he worked his way round the end of it and came on to the lower  course of Cunningham's Gwydir, which he followed down for eighty miles.  At this point he turned north and suddenly came to the largest river he  had yet seen. Mitchell, ever on the alert to bestow native names on  geographical features -- a most praiseworthy trait in his character, and  through the absence of which in most other explorers, Australian  nomenclature lacks distinction and often euphony -- enquired of the name  from the natives, and found it to be called the Karaula. Was this, or was  this not the nebulous Kindur? The answer could be supplied only by  tracing its course; but its general direction and the discovery and  recognition of its junction with the Gwydir showed that the Karaula was  but the upper flow of Sturt's Darling. Much disappointed, for Mitchell  was intent upon the discovery of a new river system having a northerly  outflow, he prepared to make a bold push into the interior. Before he  started, Finch, his assistant-surveyor arrived hurriedly on the scene  with a tale of death. Finch had been bringing up supplies, and during his  temporary absence his camp had been attacked by the natives, the cattle  dispersed, the supplies carried off, and two of the teamsters murdered.  All ideas of further penetration into the new country had to be  abandoned. Mitchell was compelled to hasten back, bury the bodies of the  victims, and after an ineffective quest for the murderers, return to the  settled districts.    The journey, however, had not been without good results. Knowledge of the  Darling had been considerably extended, and it was now shown to be the  stream receiving the outflow of the rivers whose higher courses  Cunningham had discovered. The beginning of the great river system of the  Darling may be said to have been thus placed among proven data. Mitchell  himself afterwards showed himself an untiring and zealous worker in  solving the identity of the many ramifications of this system.    7.3. THE PASSAGE OF THE DARLING.    His next journey was undertaken to confirm the fact of the union of the  Darling and the Murray. Sturt himself was fully convinced that he had  seen the junction of the two rivers when on his long boat voyage; but he  had not converted every one, and Mitchell, with a large party was  despatched to settle the question and make a systematic survey. Early in  March, 1833, the expedition left Parramatta to proceed by easy stages to  the head of the Bogan River, which had been partly traversed the year  before by surveyor Dixon. It was during this expedition that Richard  Cunningham, brother of Allan, was murdered by the natives. He had not  been long in Australia, and had been appointed botanist to the  expedition. On the morning of April 17th, he lost sight of the party,  whilst pursuing some scientific quest, and as the main body were then  pushing hurriedly over a dry stage to the Bogan River, he was not  immediately missed. Not having any bush experience, he lost himself, and  was never seen again. A long and painful search followed, but owing to  some mischance, Cunningham's tracks were lost on the third day, and it  was not until the 23rd of the month that they were again found. Larmer,  the assistant-surveyor, and three men were sent to follow them up until  they found the lost man. Three days later they returned, having come  across only the horse he had ridden, dead, with the saddle and bridle  still on. Mitchell personally conducted the further search. Cunningham's  tracks were again picked up, and his wandering and erratic footsteps  traced to the Bogan, where some blacks stated that they had seen the  white man's tracks in the bed of the river, and that he had gone west  with the Myalls, or wild blacks.*    *[Footnote.] Lieutenant Zouch, of the Mounted Police, subsequently found  the site of his death, and recovered a few bones, a Manilla hat, and  portions of a coat. The account afterwards given by the natives was to  the effect that the white man came to them and they gave him food, and he  camped with them: but that during the night he repeatedly got up, and  this roused their fears and suspicions, so that they determined to  destroy him. One struck him on the back of the head with a nulla-nulla,  when the others rushed in and finished the deadly work.    [Illustration. A Chief of the Bogan River Tribe. Photo by the Reverend  J.M. Curran.]    As is often the case with men lost in the bush, the unfortunate botanist,  by wandering on confusing and contradictory courses, had rendered the  work of the search party more tedious and difficult, thus sealing his own  fate. A rude stone memorial has since been erected on the spot, and a  tablet put up in the St. Andrew's Scots Church, Sydney. The death of  Cunningham, who was a young and ardent man with the promise of a  brilliant future caused Mitchell much distress of mind. He did all he  could to find his lost comrade, and jeopardised the success of the  expedition by the long delay of fourteen days.    He resumed his journey by easy stages down the Bogan, and on the 25th of  May came to the Darling. This river was at once recognised by all who had  been with him on his former trip as identical with the Karaula as  Mitchell had supposed; but he found the country in a different condition  from that presented by it when Sturt and Hume first discovered the river  at nearly the same place. The water was now fresh and sweet to drink, and  the flats and banks luxuriant with grass and herbage.    After choosing a site for a camp, where the town of Bourke now stands,  Mitchell erected a stockade of logs, which he named Fort Bourke, after  the Governor. The country on either side of the Darling was now alive  with natives, and though a sort of armed truce was kept up, it was at the  cost of constant care and watchfulness, and the tactful submission to  numerous annoyances, including much petty pilfering. The boats proved to  be of no service, and after Mitchell with a small party had made a short  excursion down the river to the farthest limit of Sturt and Hume in 1829,  where he saw the tree then marked by Hume, H.H., he had the camp  dismantled, and started with the whole party to follow the river down to  its junction with the Murray.    By the 11th of July, one month after leaving Fort Bourke, they had traced  the river for three hundred miles through a country of level monotony  unbroken by any tributary rivers or creeks of the least importance.  Mitchell was now certain from the steadfast direction the river  maintained, and the short distance that now intervened between the lowest  point they had reached and Sturt's junction, that Sturt had really been  correct in his surmise, and that he had witnessed the meeting of the  rivers on that memorable occasion. He therefore decided that to keep on  was but needlessly endangering the lives of his men. He was constantly  kept in a state of anxiety for the safety of any member of the party  whose duty compelled him to separate from the main body, for the natives,  who had become doubly bold through familiarity, were now persistently  encroaching and rapidly assuming a defiant manner.    On the very day that Mitchell had made up his mind to retreat, the long  threatened rupture took place. Mitchell refers to the blacks of this  region as the most unfavourable specimens of aborigine that he had yet  seen, barbarously and"]]]
