I do not believe that either he or his mother had the least  idea of the importance of the rite.    The priest then hurriedly performed mass, and read the burial  service over the deceased, who had belonged to rather a wealthy  family, and therefore was respectably interred.  Unfortunately, when  they wanted to lower the corpse into its cold resting-place, the  latter was found to be too short and too narrow, and the poor wretch  was so tossed about, coffin and all, that I expected every moment to  see him roll out.  But all was of no avail, and after a great deal  of useless exertion no other course was left but to place the coffin  on one side and enlarge the grave, which was done with much  unwillingness and amid an unceasing volley of oaths.    This fatiguing work being at last finished, I returned to the house,  where I took a good dejeuner a la fourchette in company with the  priest, and then set out with my black guide.    We rode for some time through a broad valley between splendid woods,  and had to cross two rivers, the Parahyby and the Pomba, in trunks  of trees hollowed out.  For each of these wretched conveyances I was  obliged to pay one milreis (2s. 2d.), and to incur great danger into  the bargain; not so much on account of the stream and the small size  of the craft, as of our mules, which, fastened by their halter, swam  alongside, and frequently came so near that I was afraid that we  should be every moment capsized.    After riding twelve miles further, we reached the last settlement of  the whites. {47}  On an open space, which had with difficulty been  conquered from the virgin forest, stood a largish wooden house,  surrounded by a few miserable huts, the house serving as the  residence of the whites, and the huts as that of the slaves.  A  letter which I had brought from the priest procured me a welcome.    The manner of living in this settlement was of such a description  that I was almost tempted to believe that I was already among  savages.    The large house contained an entrance hall leading into four rooms,  each of which was inhabited by a white family.  The whole furniture  of these rooms consisted of a few hammocks and straw mats.  The  inhabitants were cowering upon the floor, playing with the children,  or assisting one another to get rid of their vermin.  The kitchen  was immediately adjoining the house, and resembled a very large barn  with openings in it; upon a hearth that took up nearly the entire  length of the barn, several fires were burning, over which hung  small kettles, and at each side were fastened wooden spits.  On  these were fixed several pieces of meat, some of which were being  roasted by the fire and some cured by the smoke.  The kitchen was  full of people:  whites, Puris, and negroes, children whose parents  were whites and Puris, or Puris and negroes--in a word, the place  was like a book of specimens containing the most varied  ramifications of the three principal races of the country.    In the court-yard was an immense number of fowls, beautifully marked  ducks and geese; I also saw some extraordinarily fat pigs, and some  horribly ugly dogs.  Under some cocoa-palms and tamarind-trees, were  seated white and coloured people, separate and in groups, mostly  occupied in satisfying their hunger.  Some had got broken basins or  pumpkin-gourds before them, in which they kneaded up with their  hands boiled beans and manioc flour; this thick and disgusting-  looking mess they devoured with avidity.  Others were eating pieces  of meat, which they likewise tore with their hands, and threw into  their mouths alternately with handfuls of manioc flour.  The  children, who also had their gourds before them, were obliged to  defend the contents valiantly; for at one moment a hen would peck  something out, and, at the next, a dog would run off with a bit, or  sometimes even a little pig would waggle up, and invariably give a  most contented grunt when it had not performed the journey for  nothing.    While I was making these observations, I suddenly heard a merry cry  outside the court-yard; I proceeded to the place from which it  issued, and saw two boys dragging towards me a large dark brown  serpent; certainly more than seven feet long, at the end of a bast-  rope.  It was already dead, and, as far as I could learn from the  explanations of those about me, it was of so venomous a kind, that  if a person is bitten by it, he immediately swells up and dies.    I was rather startled at what I heard, and determined at least not  to set out through the wood just as evening was closing in, as I  might have to take up my quarters for the night under some tree; I  therefore deferred my visit to the savages until the next morning.  The good people imagined that I was afraid of the savages, and  earnestly assured me that they were a most harmless race, from whom  I had not the least to fear.  As my knowledge of Portuguese was  limited to a few words, I found it rather difficult to make myself  understood, and it was only by the help of gesticulations, with now  and then a small sketch, that I succeeded in enlightening them as to  the real cause of my fear.    I passed the night, therefore, with these half savages, who  constantly showed me the greatest respect, and overwhelmed me with  attention.  A straw mat, which, at my request, was spread out under  shelter in the court-yard, was my bed.  They brought me for supper a  roast fowl, rice, and hard eggs, and for dessert, oranges and  tamarind-pods; the latter contain a brown, half sweet, half sour  pulp, very agreeable to the taste.  The women lay all round me, and  by degrees we managed to get on wonderfully together.    I showed them the different flowers and insects I had gathered  during the day.  This, doubtless, induced them to look upon me as a  learned person, and, as such, to impute to me a knowledge of  medicine.  They begged me to prescribe for different cases of  illness:  bad ears, eruptions of the skin, and in the children, a  considerable tendency to scrofula, etc.  I ordered lukewarm baths,  frequent fomentations, and the use of oil and soap, applied  externally and rubbed into the body.  May Heaven grant that these  remedies have really worked some good!    On the 11th of October, I proceeded into the forest, in company with  a negress and a Puri, to find out the Indians.  At times, we had to  work our way laboriously through the thicket, and then again we  would find narrow paths, by which we pursued our journey with  greater ease.  After eight hours' walking, we came upon a number of  Puris, who led us into their huts, situated in the immediate  vicinity, where I beheld a picture of the greatest misery and want:  I had often met with a great deal of wretchedness in my travels, but  never so much as I saw here!    On a small space, under lofty trees, five huts, or rather sheds,  formed of leaves, were erected, eighteen feet long, by twelve feet  broad.  The frames were formed of four poles stuck in the ground,  with another reaching across; and the roof, of palm-leaves, through  which the rain could penetrate with the utmost facility.  On three  sides, these bowers were entirely open.  In the interior hung a  hammock or two; and on the ground glimmered a little fire, under a  heap of ashes, in which a few roots, Indian corn, and bananas, were  roasting.  In one corner, under the roof, a small supply of  provisions was hoarded up, and a few gourds were scattered around:  these are used by the savages instead of plates, pots, water-jugs,  etc.  The long bows and arrows, which constitute their only weapons,  were leaning in the background against the wall.    I found the Indians still more ugly than the negroes.  Their  complexion is a light bronze, stunted in stature, well-knit, and  about the middle size.  They have broad and somewhat compressed  features, and thick, coal-black hair, hanging straight down, which  the women sometimes wear in plaits fastened to the back of the head,  and sometimes falling down loose about them.  Their forehead is  broad and low, the nose somewhat flattened, the eyes long and  narrow, almost like those of the Chinese, and the mouth large, with  rather thick lips.  To give a still greater effect to all these  various charms, a peculiar look of stupidity is spread over the  whole face, and is more especially to be attributed to the way in  which their mouths are always kept opened.    Most of them, both men and women, were tattooed with a reddish or  blue colour, though only round the mouth, in the form of a  moustache.  Both sexes are passionately fond of smoking, and prefer  brandy to everything.  Their dress was composed of a few rags, which  they had fastened round their loins.    I had already heard, in Novo Friburgo, a few interesting particulars  concerning the Puris, which I will here relate.    The number of the Brazilian Indians at the present time is  calculated at about 500,000, who live scattered about the forests in  the heart of the country.  Not more than six or seven families ever  settle on the same spot, which they leave as soon as the game in the  neighbourhood has been killed, and all the fruit and roots consumed.  A large number of these Indians have been christened.  They are  always ready, for a little brandy or tobacco, to undergo the  ceremony at the shortest notice, and only regret that it cannot be  repeated more frequently, as it is soon over.  The priest believes  that he has only to perform the rite in order to gain another soul  for heaven, and afterwards gives himself very little concern, either  about the instruction or the manners and morals of his converts.  These, it is true, are called Christians, or _tamed savages_, but  live in the same heathen manner that they previously did.  Thus, for  instance, they contract marriages for indefinite periods; elect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#16)"],[1,"wait. If anything happens  I'll call--you might leave your door ajar, perhaps.\"    And she came up, looking like a ghost.    But I saw her first safely into bed, and the rest of the night I spent  in an armchair close to my opened door, listening for the slightest  sound. Soon after five o'clock I heard Frances fumbling with the key,  and, peering over the railing again, I waited till she reappeared and  went back into her own room. She closed her door. Evidently she was  satisfied that all was well.    Then, and then only, did I go to bed myself, but not to sleep. I could  not get the scene out of my mind, especially that odious detail of it  which I hoped and believed my sister had not seen--the still, dark  figure of the housekeeper waiting on the stairs below--waiting, of  course, for Mabel.          Chapter IX      It seems I became a mere spectator after that; my sister's lead was so  assured for one thing, and, for another, the responsibility of leaving  Mabel alone--Frances laid it bodily upon my shoulders--was a little more  than I cared about. Moreover, when we all three met later in the day,  things went on so exactly as before, so absolutely without friction or  distress, that to present a sudden, obvious excuse for cutting our visit  short seemed ill-judged. And on the lowest grounds it would have been  desertion. At any rate, it was beyond my powers, and Frances was quite  firm that she must stay. We therefore did stay. Things that happen in  the night always seem exaggerated and distorted when the sun shines  brightly next morning; no one can reconstruct the terror of a nightmare  afterwards, nor comprehend why it seemed so overwhelming at the time.    I slept till ten o'clock, and when I rang for breakfast, a note from my  sister lay upon the tray, its message of counsel couched in a calm and  comforting strain. Mabel, she assured me, was herself again and  remembered nothing of what had happened; there was no need of any  violent measures; I was to treat her exactly as if I knew nothing. \"And,  if you don't mind, Bill, let us leave the matter unmentioned between  ourselves as well. Discussion exaggerates; such things are best not  talked about. I'm sorry I disturbed you so unnecessarily; I was stupidly  excited. Please forget all the things I said at the moment.\" She had  written \"nonsense\" first instead of \"things,\" then scratched it out. She  wished to convey that hysteria had been abroad in the night, and I  readily gulped the explanation down, though it could not satisfy me in  the smallest degree.    There was another week of our visit still, and we stayed it out to the  end without disaster. My desire to leave at times became that frantic  thing, desire to escape; but I controlled it, kept silent, watched and  wondered. Nothing happened. As before, and everywhere, there was no  sequence of development, no connection between cause and effect; and  climax, none whatever. The thing swayed up and down, backwards and  forwards like a great loose curtain in the wind, and I could only  vaguely surmise what caused the draught or why there was a curtain at  all. A novelist might mold the queer material into coherent sequence  that would be interesting but could not be true.    It remains, therefore, not a story but a history. Nothing happened.    Perhaps my intense dislike of the fall of darkness was due wholly to my  stirred imagination, and perhaps my anger when I learned that Frances  now occupied a bed in our hostess's room was unreasonable. Nerves were  unquestionably on edge. I was forever on the lookout for some event that  should make escape imperative, but yet that never presented itself. I  slept lightly, left my door ajar to catch the slightest sound, even made  stealthy tours of the house below-stairs while everybody dreamed in  their beds. But I discovered nothing; the doors were always locked; I  neither saw the housekeeper again in unreasonable times and places, nor  heard a footstep in the passages and halls. The Noise was never once  repeated. That horrible, ultimate thunder, my intensest dread of all,  lay withdrawn into the abyss whence it had twice arisen. And though in  my thoughts it was sternly denied existence, the great black reason for  the fact afflicted me unbelievably. Since Mabel's fruitless effort to  escape, the Doors kept closed remorselessly. She had failed; they gave  up hope. For this was the explanation that haunted the region of my mind  where feelings stir and hint before they clothe themselves in actual  language. Only I firmly kept it there; it never knew expression.    But, if my ears were open, my eyes were opened too, and it were idle to  pretend that I did not notice a hundred details that were capable of  sinister interpretation had I been weak enough to yield. Some protective  barrier had fallen into ruins round me, so that Terror stalked behind  the general collapse, feeling for me through all the gaping fissures.  Much of this, I admit, must have been merely the elaboration of those  sensations I had first vaguely felt, before subsequent events and my  talks with Frances had dramatized them into living thoughts. I therefore  leave them unmentioned in this history, just as my mind left them  unmentioned in that interminable final week. Our life went on precisely  as before--Mabel unreal and outwardly so still; Frances, secretive,  anxious, tactful to the point of slyness, and keen to save to the point  of self-forgetfulness.    There were the same stupid meals, the same wearisome long evenings, the  stifling ugliness of house and grounds, the Shadow settling in so  thickly that it seemed almost a visible, tangible thing. I came to feel  the only friendly things in all this hostile, cruel place were the  robins that hopped boldly over the monstrous terraces and even up to the  windows of the unsightly house itself. The robins alone knew joy; they  danced, believing no evil thing was possible in all God's radiant world.  They believed in everybody; their god's plan of life had no room in it  for hell, damnation, and lakes of brimstone. I came to love the little  birds. Had Samuel Franklyn known them, he might have preached a  different sermon, bequeathing love in place of terror!    Most of my time I spent writing; but it was a pretence at best, and  rather a dangerous one besides. For it stirred the mind to production,  with the result that other things came pouring in as well. With reading  it was the same. In the end I found an aggressive, deliberate resistance  to be the only way of feasible defense. To walk far afield was out of  the question, for it meant leaving my sister too long alone, so that my  exercise was confined to nearer home. My saunters in the grounds,  however, never surprised the goblin garden again. It was close at hand,  but I seemed unable to get wholly into it. Too many things assailed my  mind for any one to hold exclusive possession, perhaps.    Indeed, all the interpretations, all the \"layers,\" to use my sister's  phrase, slipped in by turns and lodged there for a time. They came day  and night, and though my reason denied them entrance they held their own  as by a kind of squatter's right. They stirred moods already in me, that  is, and did not introduce entirely new ones; for every mind conceals  ancestral deposits that have been cultivated in turn along the whole  line of its descent. Any day a chance shower may cause this one or that  to blossom. Thus it came to me, at any rate. After darkness the  Inquisition paced the empty corridors and set up ghastly apparatus in  the dismal halls; and once, in the library, there swept over me that  easy and delicious conviction that by confessing my wickedness I could  resume it later, since Confession is expression, and expression brings  relief and leaves one ready to accumulate again. And in such mood I felt  bitter and unforgiving towards all others who thought differently.  Another time it was a Pagan thing that assaulted me--so trivial yet oh,  so significant at the time--when I dreamed that a herd of centaurs  rolled up with a great stamping of hoofs round the house to destroy it,  and then woke to hear the horses tramping across the field below the  lawns; they neighed ominously and their noisy panting was audible as if  it were just outside my windows.    But the tree episode, I think, was the most curious of all--except,  perhaps, the incident with the children which I shall mention in a  moment--for its closeness to reality was so unforgettable.    Outside the east window of my room stood a giant wellingtonia on the  lawn, its head rising level with the upper sash. It grew some twenty  feet away, planted on the highest terrace, and I often saw it when  closing my curtains for the night, noticing how it drew its heavy skirts  about it, and how the light from other windows threw glimmering streaks  and patches that turned it into the semblance of a towering, solemn  image. It stood there then so strikingly, somehow like a great old-world  idol, that it claimed attention. Its appearance was curiously  formidable. Its branches rustled without visibly moving and it had a  certain portentous, forbidding air, so grand and dark and monstrous in  the night that I was always glad when my curtains shut it out. Yet, once  in bed, I had never thought about it one way or the other, and by day  had certainly never sought it out.    One night, then, as I went to bed and closed this window against a  cutting easterly wind, I saw--that there were two of these trees. A  brother wellingtonia rose mysteriously beside it, equally huge, equally  towering, equally monstrous. The menacing pair of them faced me there  upon the lawn. But in this new arrival lay a strange suggestion that  frightened me before I could argue it away. Exact counterpart of its  giant companion, it revealed also that gross, odious quality that all my  sister's paintings held. I got the odd impression that the rest of"]]]
