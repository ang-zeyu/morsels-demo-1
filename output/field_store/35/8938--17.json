Trouble is, you  don't appreciate yourself. You've had it drilled into you so long that  you're stupid that now you believe it. All nonsense! You got more than  a million have and you're fast right now on the draw. Once get hold of  how important it is, and you'll keep trying. But you think it's only a  game. You just play at it; you don't work! I wish you could have seen  me when I was first practicing with a gun! I lived with it. Hours  every day it was my companion, and right up to now, there ain't a day  goes by that I don't spend some time keeping on edge with my revolver.  Bull, you'll have to do the same thing. You hear?\"    He sprang up again. It was impossible for him to remain seated a long  time.    \"You think it don't mean much. Look here!\"    The Colt flicked into his hand and lay trembling in his palm, and as  he talked, it shifted smoothly, as if of its own volition, forward  toward his fingertips, backward, to the side, dropping out until it  seemed about to fall, only to be caught with one finger through the  trigger-guard and spun up again. Always the heavy weapon was in motion  as though some of the nervous spirit of Reeve had entered the heavy  metal. It responded to his thoughts rather than to his muscles. Bull  Hunter gazed enchanted. He was accustomed to forgetting himself and  admiring others.    \"Look here!\" went on the little man. \"Look at me. I weigh about a  hundred and twenty. I'm skinny. I'm a runt. And look at you. You  weigh--heaven knows what! No fat, but all muscle from your head to  your feet. You're the strongest man that I've ever seen. Take me, I'm  not a coward; but you, Bull, you don't know what fear means. Well,  there you are, without fear, and stronger than three strong men.  You're pretty fast with a gun, and you shoot straight as a hawk looks.  And still, if we stood face to face and went for our guns, I'd live;  and you with your muscle would be dead, Bull.\"    \"I know,\" Bull nodded.    \"That's what this gun means,\" cried Pete. \"This gun, and the fact that  I can get it out of the leather faster'n you do. Not very much faster.  But by just as much quicker as it takes for an eyelid to wink. That  ain't much time, but it's enough time to mean life or death! That's  all! I'm not the only man that's faster'n you are. They's others. I've  never been beat to the draw, but they's some that's shot so close to  me that it sounded like one gun going off--with a sort of a stammer.  And any one of those men would of shot you dead, Bull, if you'd fought  'em. Now, knowing that, tell me, are you going to keep practicing?\"    \"I'll keep tryin', Pete. But I'll never get much faster. You see, my  arm--it's too big, too heavy. It gets in my way, handling a little  thing like a revolver!\"    Pete spun the big Colt and shoved it back into the holster so  incredibly fast that the steel hissed against the leather.    \"There you go running yourself down,\" he muttered.    He began to pace the room again, biting his nether lip, and now and  then shooting side glances at Bull, glances partly guilty and partly  scornful. Presently he came to a halt. He had also come to a new  resolution, one that cost him so much that beads of perspiration  came out on his forehead.    \"Bull,\" he said gravely, \"I'm going to tell you the secret.\"    \"You've told me a dozen already,\" Bull sighed. \"You've taught me how  to swing the muzzle up, and not too far up, and how to lean back  instead of forward, and how to harden the arm muscles just as I pull  the trigger, and how to squeeze with the whole hand and keep my wrist  stiff, and how--\"    \"None of them things counts,\" said Pete gravely, almost sadly,  \"compared to what I'm going to tell you. Stand up!\"    It was plain that he was going to give something from the depths of  his mind. The cost and importance of it made his eyes like steel and  drew his mouth to a thin, straight line.    Bull Hunter arose; and as the great body unfolded and the legs  straightened, it seemed that he would never reach his full height.  At length he stood, enormous, wide, towering. He was not a freak,  but simply a perfectly proportioned man increased to a huge scale.    Pete Reeve canted his head back and looked into the face of the giant.  There was a momentary affectionate appreciation in his eye. Then he  hardened his expression.    \"Let your arm hang loose.\"    Bull Hunter obeyed. The hand came just above the holster that was  strapped on his thigh. All these weeks Pete Reeve had kept him from  going an instant without that gun except when he slept. And even when  he slept the gun had to be under his pillow.    \"Because it helps to have it near all the time,\" Pete had explained.  \"It sort of soaks into your dreams. It's never out of your mind. It  haunts you, like the face of the girl you love. You see!\"    Bull Hunter did not see, but he had nodded humbly, after his fashion,  and obeyed. Now, with his arm fallen loose at his side he peered  studiously into the face of his master gunman and waited for the  next order.    \"Draw!\"    The command was snapped out; Bull's gun whipped from the holster; and  Pete Reeve drew in the same instant, carelessly, his eyes watching the  movement of Bull instead of paying heed and put his gun up again, but  Bull followed the example almost reluctantly.    \"Nearly beat you that time, Pete,\" he exclaimed happily. \"But maybe  you weren't half trying?\"    \"Beat me?\" sneered Pete. \"I wasn't half trying, but you didn't beat  me. I shot you twice before you had your muzzle in line. I shot you in  the throat and through the teeth before your gun was ready.\"    Bull, with a shrug of the massive shoulders, touched the mentioned  places and looked with awe at the little man.    \"Now, listen!\"    Bull grew tense.    \"Watch my draw!\"    Pete did not put his hand near the butt of his weapon. He held his arm  out before him, dangling in the air. There was a convulsive moment.  One could see the imaginary weapon shoot from the holster and become  level and rigid, pointed at its mark.    \"I've seen before--fast as my eye could go,\" Bull sighed.    \"Look again,\" said Pete, gritting his teeth with impatience. \"This  time I'm going so slow a cow could see and beat me.\"    He made the same motion, but to an ordinary eye it was still as fast  as light. Bull shook his head.    \"Idiot!\" cried Pete, his voice jumping up the scale, flat and harsh  and piercing. \"It's the wrist! Not the arm, but the--\"    He stopped with an expression of dismay. Even now he regretted  revealing the mystery, it seemed. But then he went on.    \"I found out quick that I couldn't beat a good gunman if I used the  old methods. Practice makes perfect; they practiced as much as I did.  So I studied the methods and the great idea come to me. They all use  the whole arm. Look at you! Your shoulder bulges up when you make the  draw, and you raise the whole arm. Matter of fact, you'd ought only to  use your fingers. Not stir a muscle above the wrist. Now try!\"    Bull tried--the gun did come clear of the holster.    \"No good,\" he said gravely. \"It's magic when you do it, Pete. It just  makes a fool of me.\"    \"Shut up and listen!\" Pete said sharply. \"I'm telling you a thing  that'll save your life some day!\"    He drew a little closer. His emotion made him swell to a greater  stature, and he rose a little on tiptoe as if partly to make up for  the differences between their bulks.    Bull obeyed.    \"Now start thinking. Start concentrating on that right hand. There's  nothing else to your body. You see? You forget you got a muscle.  There's three things in the world. You see? Just three things and no  more. There's your gun with a bullet in it; there's your hand that's  going to get the gun out; and there's your target--that doorknob, say!  Keep on thinking. They ain't any more to your body. You're just a hand  and an eye. All your nerves are down there in that hand. They're all  piled down there. That hand is full of electricity. Don't let your  eyes wander. Keep on concentrating. You're stocking the electricity in  that hand. When your hand moves, it'll be as fast as the jump of a  spark! And when that hand moves, the gun is going to come out clean in  it. It's _got_ to come out with it! You hear? It's _got_ to! Your  fingertips catch under the butt; they flick up. They don't draw the  gun; they throw it out of the holster; they pitch the muzzle up, and  the butt comes smack back against the palm of your hand. And in the  same part of a second you pull the trigger. You hear?\"    He leaned forward, trembling from head to foot. The eyes of the big  man were beginning to narrow.    \"I hear; I understand!\" he said through his teeth.    \"You don't pull the gun. You _think_ it out of the leather. And then  the bullet hits the doorknob. You don't move your arm. Your arm  doesn't exist. You're just a hand and a brain--thinking! And that  thought sends a bullet at the mark!\" He leaped back. \"Draw!\"    There was a wink of light at the hip of Bull Hunter, and the gun  roared.    Instantly he cried out, alarmed, confused, ashamed.    \"I didn't mean to shoot, Pete. I'm a fool! I didn't mean to! It--I  sort of couldn't help it. The--the trigger was just pulled without my  wanting it to! Lord, what'll people think!\"    But Pete Reeve had flung his arms around the big man as far as they  would go, and he hugged him in a hysteria of joy. Then he leaped back,  dancing, throwing up his hands.    \"You done it!\" he cried, his voice squeaking, hysterical.    \"I made a fool of myself, all right,\" said Bull, bewildered by this  exhibition of joy where he had expected anger.    \"Fool nothing! Look at that knob!\"    The doorknob was a smashed wreck, driven into the thick wood of the  door by the heavy slug of the revolver. Footsteps were running up the  stairs of the hotel.

The squatters  kept them off as much as possible, by all manner of dodges and paltry  persecution. The squatter would get as much freehold as he could afford,  'select' as much land as the law allowed one man to take up, and then  employ dummies (dummy selectors) to take up bits of land that he fancied  about his run, and hold them for him.    Spicer seemed gloomy and unsociable. He was seldom at home. He was  generally supposed to be away shearin', or fencin', or workin' on  somebody's station. It turned out that the last six months he was away  it was on the evidence of a cask of beef and a hide with the brand cut  out, found in his camp on a fencing contract up-country, and which he  and his mates couldn't account for satisfactorily, while the squatter  could. Then the family lived mostly on bread and honey, or bread and  treacle, or bread and dripping, and tea. Every ounce of butter and every  egg was needed for the market, to keep them in flour, tea, and sugar.  Mary found that out, but couldn't help them much--except by 'stuffing'  the children with bread and meat or bread and jam whenever they came up  to our place--for Mrs Spicer was proud with the pride that lies down in  the end and turns its face to the wall and dies.    Once, when Mary asked Annie, the eldest girl at home, if she was  hungry, she denied it--but she looked it. A ragged mite she had with her  explained things. The little fellow said--    'Mother told Annie not to say we was hungry if yer asked; but if yer  give us anythink to eat, we was to take it an' say thenk yer, Mrs  Wilson.'    'I wouldn't 'a' told yer a lie; but I thought Jimmy would split on me,  Mrs Wilson,' said Annie. 'Thenk yer, Mrs Wilson.'    She was not a big woman. She was gaunt and flat-chested, and her face  was 'burnt to a brick', as they say out there. She had brown eyes,  nearly red, and a little wild-looking at times, and a sharp face--ground  sharp by hardship--the cheeks drawn in. She had an expression  like--well, like a woman who had been very curious and suspicious at one  time, and wanted to know everybody's business and hear everything, and  had lost all her curiosity, without losing the expression or the quick  suspicious movements of the head. I don't suppose you understand. I  can't explain it any other way. She was not more than forty.    I remember the first morning I saw her. I was going up the creek to look  at the selection for the first time, and called at the hut to see if she  had a bit of fresh mutton, as I had none and was sick of 'corned beef'.    'Yes--of--course,' she said, in a sharp nasty tone, as if to say, 'Is  there anything more you want while the shop's open?' I'd met just the  same sort of woman years before while I was carrying swag between the  shearing-sheds in the awful scrubs out west of the Darling river, so I  didn't turn on my heels and walk away. I waited for her to speak again.    'Come--inside,' she said, 'and sit down. I see you've got the waggon  outside. I s'pose your name's Wilson, ain't it? You're thinkin' about  takin' on Harry Marshfield's selection up the creek, so I heard. Wait  till I fry you a chop and boil the billy.'    Her voice sounded, more than anything else, like a voice coming out of  a phonograph--I heard one in Sydney the other day--and not like a voice  coming out of her. But sometimes when she got outside her everyday  life on this selection she spoke in a sort of--in a sort of lost  groping-in-the-dark kind of voice.    She didn't talk much this time--just spoke in a mechanical way of the  drought, and the hard times, 'an' butter 'n' eggs bein' down, an' her  husban' an' eldest son bein' away, an' that makin' it so hard for her.'    I don't know how many children she had. I never got a chance to count  them, for they were nearly all small, and shy as piccaninnies, and used  to run and hide when anybody came. They were mostly nearly as black as  piccaninnies too. She must have averaged a baby a-year for years--and  God only knows how she got over her confinements! Once, they said, she  only had a black gin with her. She had an elder boy and girl, but she  seldom spoke of them. The girl, 'Liza', was 'in service in Sydney.' I'm  afraid I knew what that meant. The elder son was 'away'. He had been a  bit of a favourite round there, it seemed.    Some one might ask her, 'How's your son Jack, Mrs Spicer?' or, 'Heard of  Jack lately? and where is he now?'    'Oh, he's somewheres up country,' she'd say in the 'groping' voice, or  'He's drovin' in Queenslan',' or 'Shearin' on the Darlin' the last time  I heerd from him.' 'We ain't had a line from him since--les' see--since  Chris'mas 'fore last.'    And she'd turn her haggard eyes in a helpless, hopeless sort of way  towards the west--towards 'up-country' and 'Out-Back'.*           * 'Out-Back' is always west of the Bushman, no matter how       far out he be.      The eldest girl at home was nine or ten, with a little old face and  lines across her forehead: she had an older expression than her mother.  Tommy went to Queensland, as I told you. The eldest son at home, Bill  (older than Tommy), was 'a bit wild.'    I've passed the place in smothering hot mornings in December, when the  droppings about the cow-yard had crumpled to dust that rose in the  warm, sickly, sunrise wind, and seen that woman at work in the cow-yard,  'bailing up' and leg-roping cows, milking, or hauling at a rope round  the neck of a half-grown calf that was too strong for her (and she was  tough as fencing-wire), or humping great buckets of sour milk to the  pigs or the 'poddies' (hand-fed calves) in the pen. I'd get off the  horse and give her a hand sometimes with a young steer, or a cranky old  cow that wouldn't 'bail-up' and threatened her with her horns. She'd  say--    'Thenk yer, Mr Wilson. Do yer think we're ever goin' to have any rain?'    I've ridden past the place on bitter black rainy mornings in June or  July, and seen her trudging about the yard--that was ankle-deep in black  liquid filth--with an old pair of Blucher boots on, and an old coat of  her husband's, or maybe a three-bushel bag over her shoulders. I've seen  her climbing on the roof by means of the water-cask at the corner, and  trying to stop a leak by shoving a piece of tin in under the bark. And  when I'd fixed the leak--    'Thenk yer, Mr Wilson. This drop of rain's a blessin'! Come in and have  a dry at the fire and I'll make yer a cup of tea.' And, if I was in a  hurry, 'Come in, man alive! Come in! and dry yerself a bit till the rain  holds up. Yer can't go home like this! Yer'll git yer death o' cold.'    I've even seen her, in the terrible drought, climbing she-oaks and  apple-trees by a makeshift ladder, and awkwardly lopping off boughs to  feed the starving cattle.    'Jist tryin' ter keep the milkers alive till the rain comes.'    They said that when the pleuro-pneumonia was in the district and amongst  her cattle she bled and physicked them herself, and fed those that were  down with slices of half-ripe pumpkins (from a crop that had failed).    'An', one day,' she told Mary, 'there was a big barren heifer (that we  called Queen Elizabeth) that was down with the ploorer. She'd been down  for four days and hadn't moved, when one mornin' I dumped some wheaten  chaff--we had a few bags that Spicer brought home--I dumped it in front  of her nose, an'--would yer b'lieve me, Mrs Wilson?--she stumbled onter  her feet an' chased me all the way to the house! I had to pick up me  skirts an' run! Wasn't it redic'lus?'    They had a sense of the ridiculous, most of those poor sun-dried  Bushwomen. I fancy that that helped save them from madness.    'We lost nearly all our milkers,' she told Mary. 'I remember one day  Tommy came running to the house and screamed: 'Marther! [mother] there's  another milker down with the ploorer!' Jist as if it was great news.  Well, Mrs Wilson, I was dead-beat, an' I giv' in. I jist sat down  to have a good cry, and felt for my han'kerchief--it WAS a rag of a  han'kerchief, full of holes (all me others was in the wash). Without  seein' what I was doin' I put me finger through one hole in the  han'kerchief an' me thumb through the other, and poked me fingers into  me eyes, instead of wipin' them. Then I had to laugh.'    There's a story that once, when the Bush, or rather grass, fires were  out all along the creek on Spicer's side, Wall's station hands were up  above our place, trying to keep the fire back from the boundary, and  towards evening one of the men happened to think of the Spicers: they  saw smoke down that way. Spicer was away from home, and they had a small  crop of wheat, nearly ripe, on the selection.    'My God! that poor devil of a woman will be burnt out, if she ain't  already!' shouted young Billy Wall. 'Come along, three or four of you  chaps'--(it was shearing-time, and there were plenty of men on the  station).    They raced down the creek to Spicer's, and were just in time to save the  wheat. She had her sleeves tucked up, and was beating out the burning  grass with a bough. She'd been at it for an hour, and was as black as a  gin, they said. She only said when they'd turned the fire: 'Thenk yer!  Wait an' I'll make some tea.'         *****    After tea the first Sunday she came to see us, Mary asked--    'Don't you feel lonely, Mrs Spicer, when your husband goes away?'    'Well--no, Mrs Wilson,' she said in the groping sort of voice. 'I uster,  once. I remember, when we lived on the Cudgeegong river--we lived in  a brick house then--the first time Spicer had to go away from home I  nearly fretted my eyes out. And he was only goin' shearin' for a month.  I muster bin a fool; but then we were only jist married a little while.  He's been away drovin' in Queenslan' as long as eighteen months at a  time since then. But' (her voice seemed to grope in the dark more  than ever) 'I don't mind,--I somehow seem to have got past carin'.  Besides--besi"]]]
