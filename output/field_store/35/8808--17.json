If one prickling grain  Could so put out his vision and so torment  That delicate brain, what weakness! How the mind  That seemed to dwarf us, dwindles! Is he mad?  So buzzed the fools, whose ponderous mental wheels  Nor dust, nor grit, nor stones, nor rocks could irk  Even for an instant.                       Newton could not sleep,  But all that careful malice could design  Was blindly fostered by well-meaning folly,  And great sane folk like Mr. Samuel Pepys  Canvassed his weakness and slept sound all night.  For little Samuel with his rosy face  Came chirping into a coffee-house one day  Like a plump robin, \"Sir, the unhappy state  Of Mr. Isaac Newton grieves me much.  Last week I had a letter from him, filled  With strange complainings, very curious hints,  Such as, I grieve to say, are common signs  --I have observed it often--of worse to come.  He said that he could neither eat nor sleep  Because of all the embroilments he was in,  Hinting at nameless enemies. Then he begged  My pardon, very strangely. I believe  Physicians would confirm me in my fears.  'Tis very sad.... Only last night, I found  Among my papers certain lines composed  By--whom d'you think?--My lord of Halifax  (Or so dear Mrs. Porterhouse assured me)  Expressing, sir, the uttermost satisfaction  In Mr. Newton's talent. Sir, he wrote  Answering the charge that science would put out  The light of beauty, these very handsome lines:     'When Newton walked by Witham stream      There fell no chilling shade    To blight the drifting naiad's dream      Or make her garland fade.      The mist of sun was not less bright      That crowned Urania's hair.    He robbed it of its colder light,      But left the rainbow there.'    They are very neat and handsome, you'll agree.  Solid in sense as Dryden at his best,  And smooth as Waller, but with something more,--  That touch of grace, that airier elegance  Which only rank can give.                            'Tis very sad  That one so nobly praised should--well, no matter!--  I am told, sir, that these troubles all began  At Cambridge, when his manuscripts were burned.  He had been working, in his curious way,  All through the night; and, in the morning greyness  Went down to chapel, leaving on his desk  A lighted candle. You can imagine it,--  A sadly sloven altar to his Muse,  Littered with papers, cups, and greasy plates  Of untouched food. I am told that he would eat  His Monday's breakfast, sir, on Tuesday morning,  Such was his absent way!                           When he returned,  He found that Diamond (his little dog  Named Diamond, for a black patch near his tail)  Had overturned the candle. All his work  Was burned to ashes.                       It struck him to the quick,  Though, when his terrier fawned about his feet,  He showed no anger. He was heard to say,  'O Diamond, Diamond, little do you know...'  But, from that hour, ah well, we'll say no more.\"    Halley was there that day, and spoke up sharply,  \"Sir, there are hints and hints! Do you _mean_ more?\"  --\"I do, sir,\" chirruped Samuel, mightily pleased  To find all eyes, for once, on his fat face.  \"I fear his intellects are disordered, sir.\"  --\"Good! That's an answer! I can deal with that.  But tell me first,\" quoth Halley, \"why he wrote  That letter, a week ago, to Mr. Pepys.\"  --\"Why, sir,\" piped Samuel, innocent of the trap,  \"I had an argument in this coffee-house  Last week, with certain gentlemen, on the laws  Of chance, and what fair hopes a man might have  Of throwing six at dice. I happened to say  That Mr. Isaac Newton was my friend,  And promised I would sound him.\"                                   \"Sir,\" said Halley,  \"You'll pardon me, but I forgot to tell you  I heard, a minute since, outside these doors,  A very modish woman of the town,  Or else a most delicious lady of fashion,  A melting creature with a bold black eye,  A bosom like twin doves; and, sir, a mouth  Like a Turk's dream of Paradise. She cooed,  'Is Mr. Pepys within?' I greatly fear  That they denied you to her!\"                                Off ran Pepys!  \"A hint's a hint,\" laughed Halley, \"and so to bed.  But, as for Isaac Newton, let me say,  Whatever his embroilments were, he solved  With just one hour of thought, not long ago  The problem set by Leibnitz as a challenge  To all of Europe. He published his result  Anonymously, but Leibnitz, when he saw it,  Cried out, at once, old enemy as he was,  'That's Newton, none but Newton! From this claw  I know the old lion, in his midnight lair.'\"          VI      (_Sir Isaac Newton writes to Mrs. Vincent at Woolthorpe._)      Your letter, on my eightieth birthday, wakes  Memories, like violets, in this London gloom.  You have never failed, for more than three-score years  To send these annual greetings from the haunts  Where you and I were boy and girl together.  A day must come-it cannot now be far--  When I shall have no power to thank you for them,  So let me tell you now that, all my life,  They have come to me with healing in their wings  Like birds from home, birds from the happy woods  Above the Witham, where you walked with me  When you and I were young.                             Do you remember  Old Barley--how he tried to teach us drawing?  He found some promise, I believe, in you,  But quite despaired of me.                             I treasure all  Those little sketches that you sent to me  Each Christmas, carrying each some glimpse of home.  There's one I love that shows the narrow lane  Behind the schoolhouse, where I had that bout  Of schoolboy fisticuffs. I have never known  More pleasure, I believe, than when I beat  That black-haired bully and won, for my reward,  Those April smiles from you.                               I see you still  Standing among the fox-gloves in the hedge;  And just behind you, in the field, I know  There was a patch of aromatic flowers,--  Rest-harrow, was it? Yes; their tangled roots  Pluck at the harrow; halt the sharp harrow of thought,  Even in old age. I never breathe their scent  But I am back in boyhood, dreaming there  Over some book, among the diligent bees,  Until you join me, and we dream together.  They called me lazy, then. Oddly enough  It was that fight that stirred my mind to beat  My bully at his books, and head the school;  Blind rivalry, at first. By such fond tricks  The invisible Power that shapes us--not ourselves--  Punishes, teaches, leads us gently on  Like children, all our lives, until we grasp  A sudden meaning and are born, through death  Into full knowledge that our Guide was Love.  Another picture shows those woods of ours,  Around whose warm dark edges in the spring  Primroses, knots of living sunlight, woke;  And, always, you, their radiant shepherdess  From Elfland, lead them rambling back for me,  The dew still clinging to their golden fleece,  Through these grey memory-mists.                                   Another shows  My old sun-dial. You say that it is known  As \"Isaac's dial\" still. I took great pains  To set it rightly. If it has not shifted  'Twill mark the time long after I am gone;  Not like those curious water-clocks I made.  Do you remember? They worked well at first;  But the least particles in the water clogged  The holes through which it dripped; and so, one day,  We two came home so late that we were sent  Supperless to our beds; and suffered much  From the world's harshness, as we thought it then.  Would God that we might taste that harshness now.    I cannot send you what you've sent to me;  And so I wish you'll never thank me more  For those poor gifts I have sent from year to year.  I send another, and hope that you can use it  To buy yourself those comforts which you need  This Christmas-time.                       How strange it is to wake  And find that half a century has gone by,  With all our endless youth.                              They talk to me  Of my discoveries, prate of undying fame  Too late to help me. Anything I achieved  Was done through work and patience; and the men  Who sought quick roads to glory for themselves  Were capable of neither. So I won  Their hatred, and it often hampered me,  Because it vexed my mind.                            This world of ours  Would give me all, now I have ceased to want it;  For I sit here, alone, a sad old man,  Sipping his orange-water, nodding to sleep,  Not caring any more for aught they say,  Not caring any more for praise or blame;  But dreaming-things we dreamed of, long ago,  In childhood.                You and I had laughed away  That boy and girl affair. We were too poor  For anything but laughter.                             I am old;  And you, twice wedded and twice widowed, still  Retain, through all your nearer joys and griefs,  The old affection. Vaguely our blind old hands  Grope for each other in this growing dark  And deepening loneliness,--to say \"good-bye.\"  Would that my words could tell you all my heart;  But even my words grow old.                              Perhaps these lines,  Written not long ago, may tell you more.  I have no skill in verse, despite the praise  Your kindness gave me, once; but since I wrote  Thinking of you, among the woods of home,  My heart was in them. Let them turn to yours:      _Give me, for friends, my own true folk    Who kept the very word they spoke;      Whose quiet prayers, from day to day,      Have brought the heavens about my way.      Not those whose intellectual pride    Would quench the only lights that guide;      Confuse the lines 'twixt good and ill      Then throne their own capricious will;      Not those whose eyes in mockery scan    The simpler hopes and dreams of man;      Not those keen wits, so quick to hurt,      So swift to trip you in the dirt.      Not those who'd pluck your mystery out,    Yet never saw your last redoubt;      Whose cleverness would kill the song      Dead at your heart, then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#15)"],[1,"is obscure and generally debated. In fact I cannot tell what  analogy you find between philosophy and wine; there is just one, indeed:  philosophers and wine-merchants both sell their wares, mostly resorting  to adulteration, fraud, and false measures, in the process. But let us  look into your real meaning. You say all the wine in a cask is of the  same quality--which is perfectly reasonable; further, that any one who  draws and tastes quite a small quantity will know at once the quality of  the whole--of which the same may be said; I should never have thought of  objecting. But mark what comes now: do philosophy and its professors  (your own, for instance) give you every day the same remarks on the same  subjects, or do they vary them? They vary them a great deal, friend; you  would never have stuck to your master through your twenty years'  wandering--quite a philosophic Odyssey--if he had always said the same  thing; one hearing would have been enough.    _Her_. So it would.    _Ly_. How could you have known the whole of his doctrines from the  first taste, then? They were not homogeneous, like the wine; novelty  to-day, and novelty to-morrow on the top of it. Consequently, dear friend,  short of drinking the whole cask, you might soak to no purpose;  Providence seems to me to have hidden the philosophic Good right at the  bottom, underneath the lees. So you will have to drain it dry, or you  will never get to that nectar for which I know you have so long thirsted.  According to your idea, it has such virtue that, could you once taste it  and swallow the very least drop, you would straightway have perfect  wisdom; so they say the Delphian prophetess is inspired by one draught of  the sacred spring with answers for those who consult the oracle. But it  seems not to be so; you have drunk more than half the cask; yet you told  me you were only beginning yet.    Now see whether this is not a better analogy. You shall keep your  merchant, and your cask; but the contents of the latter are not to be  wine, but assorted seeds. On the top is wheat, next beans, then barley,  below that lentils, then peas--and other kinds yet. You go to buy seeds,  and he takes some wheat out of that layer, and puts it in your hand as a  sample; now, could you tell by looking at that whether the peas were  Sound, the lentils tender, and the beans full?    _Her_. Impossible.    _Ly_. No more can you tell the quality of a philosophy from the first  statements of its professor; it is not uniform, like the wine to which you  compared it, claiming that it must resemble the sample glass; it is  heterogeneous, and it had better not be cursorily tested. If you buy bad  wine, the loss is limited to a few pence; but to rot with the common herd  (in your own words) is not so light a loss. Moreover, your man who wants  to drink up the cask as a preliminary to buying a pint will injure the  merchant, with his dubious sampling; but philosophy knows no such danger;  you may drink your fill, but this cask grows no emptier, and its owner  suffers no loss. It is cut and come again here; we have the converse of  the Danaids' cask; that would not hold what was put into it; it ran  straight through; but here, the more you take away, the more remains.    And I have another similar remark to make about these specimen drops of  philosophy. Do not fancy I am libelling it, if I say it is like hemlock,  aconite, or other deadly poison. Those too, though they have death in  them, will not kill if a man scrapes off the tiniest particle with the  edge of his nail and tastes it; if they are not taken in the right  quantity, the right manner, and the right vehicle, the taker will not  die; you were wrong in claiming that the least possible quantity is  enough to base a generalization on.    _Her_. Oh, have it your own way, Lycinus. Well then, we have got to live a  hundred years, and go through all this trouble? There is no other road to  philosophy?    _Ly_. No, none; and we need not complain; as you very truly said, _ars  longa, vita brevis_. But I do not know what has come over you; you now  make a grievance of it, if you cannot before set of sun develop into a  Chrysippus, a Plato, a Pythagoras.    _Her_. You trap me, and drive me into a corner, Lycinus; yet I never  provoked you; it is all envy, I know, because I have made some progress  in my studies, whereas you have neglected yourself, when you were old  enough to know better.    _Ly_. Seest, then, thy true course? never mind me, but leave me as a  lunatic to my follies, and you go on your way and accomplish what you  have intended all this time.    _Her_. But you are so masterful, you will not let me make a choice, till I  have proved all.    _Ly_. Why, I confess, you will never get me to budge from that. But when  you call me masterful, it seems to me you blame the blameless, as the poet  says; for I am myself being dragged along by reason, until you bring up  some other reason to release me from durance. And here is reason about to  talk more masterfully still, you will see; but I suppose you will  exonerate it, and blame me.    _Her_. What can it be? I am surprised to hear it still has anything in  reserve.    _Ly_. It says that seeing and going through all philosophies will not  suffice, if you want to choose the best of them; the most important  qualification is still missing.    _Her_. Indeed? Which?    _Ly_. Why (bear with me), a critical investigating faculty, mental acumen,  intellectual precision and independence equal to the occasion; without  this, the completest inspection will be useless. Reason insists that the  owner of it must further be allowed ample time; he will collect the rival  candidates together, and make his choice with long, lingering, repeated  deliberation; he will give no heed to the candidate's age, appearance, or  repute for wisdom, but perform his functions like the Areopagites, who  judge in the darkness of night, so that they must regard not the pleaders,  but the pleadings. Then and not till then will you be able to make a sound  choice and live a philosopher.    _Her_. Live? an after life, then. No mortal span will meet your demands;  let me see: go the whole round, examine each with care, on that  examination form a judgement, on that judgement make a choice, on that  choice be a philosopher; so and no otherwise you say the truth may be  found.    _Ly_. I hardly dare tell you--even that is not exhaustive; I am afraid,  after all, the solid basis we thought we had found was imaginary. You know  how fishermen often let down their nets, feel a weight, and pull them up  expecting a great haul; when they have got them up with much toil, behold,  a stone, or an old pot full of sand. I fear our catch is one of those.    _Her_. I don't know what this particular net may be; your nets are all  round me, anyhow.    _Ly_. Well, try and get through; providentially, you are as good a  swimmer as can be. Now, this is it: granted that we go all round  experimenting, and get it done at last, too, I do not believe we shall  have solved the elementary question, whether _any_ of them has the  much-desired; perhaps they are all wrong together.    _Her_. Oh, come now! not one of _them_ right either?    _Ly_. I cannot tell. Do you think it impossible they may all be deluded,  and the truth be something which none of them has yet found?    _Her_. How can it possibly be?    _Ly_. This way: take a correct number, twenty; suppose, I mean, a man has  twenty beans in his closed hand, and asks ten different persons to guess  the number; they guess seven, five, thirty, ten, fifteen--various numbers,  in short. It is possible, I suppose, that one may be right?    _Her_. Yes.    _Ly_. It is not impossible, however, that they may all guess different  incorrect numbers, and not one of them suggest twenty beans. What say you?    _Her_. It is not impossible.    _Ly_. In the same way, all philosophers are investigating the nature of  Happiness; they get different answers one Pleasure, another Goodness,  and so through the list. It is probable that Happiness _is_ one of these;  but it is also not improbable that it is something else altogether. We  seem to have reversed the proper procedure, and hurried on to the end  before we had found the beginning I suppose we ought first to have  ascertained that the truth has actually been discovered, and that some  philosopher or other has it, and only then to have gone on to the next  question, _which_ of them is to be believed.    _Her_. So that, even if we go all through all philosophy, we shall have no  certainty of finding the truth even then; that is what you say.    _Ly_. Please, please do not ask _me_; once more, apply to reason itself.  Its answer will perhaps be that there can be no certainty yet--as long as  we cannot be sure that it is one or other of the things they say it is.    _Her_. Then, according to you, we shall never finish our quest nor  be philosophers, but have to give it up and live the life of laymen. What  you say amounts to that: philosophy is impossible and inaccessible to a  mere mortal; for you expect the aspirant first to choose the best  philosophy; and you considered that the only guarantee of such choice's  being correct was to go through all philosophy before choosing the  truest. Then in reckoning the number of years required by each you  spurned all limits, extended the thing to several generations, and made  out the quest of truth too long for the individual life; and now you  crown all by proving success doubtful even apart from all that; you say  it is uncertain whether the philosophers have ever found truth at all.    _Ly_. Could you state on oath that they have?    _Her_. Not on oath, no.    _Ly_. And yet there is much that I have intentionally spared you, though  it merits careful examination too.    _Her_. For instance?    _Ly_. Is it not said that, among the professed Stoics, Platonists, and  Epicureans, some do know"]]]
