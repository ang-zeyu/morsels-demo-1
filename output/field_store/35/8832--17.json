All that could  be done upon the occasion was to burn a countrie house, where Rob Roy  then resided, after some of his clan had, from the rocks, fired upon the  king's troops, by which a grenadier was killed.    \"Mr. Grahame of Killearn, being my deputy-sheriff in that countrie, went  along with the party that marched from Stirling; and doubtless will now  meet with the worse treatment from that barbarous people on that account.  Besides, that he is my relation, and that they know how active he has  been in the service of the Government--all which, your Lordship may  believe, puts me under very great concern for the gentleman, while, at  the same time, I can foresee no manner of way how to relieve him, other  than to leave him to chance and his own management.    \"I had my thoughts before of proposing to Government the building of some  barracks as the only expedient for suppressing these rebels, and securing  the peace of the countrie; and in that view I spoke to Genll. Carpenter,  who has now a scheme of it in his hands; and I am persuaded that will be  the true method for restraining them effectually; but, in the meantime,  it will be necessary to lodge some of the troops in those places, upon  which I intend to write to the Generall.    \"I am sensible I have troubled your Lordship with a very long letter,  which I should be ashamed of, were I myself singly concerned; but where  the honour of the King's Government is touched, I need make no apologie,  and I shall only beg leave to add, that I am, with great respect, and  truth,    \"My Lord,  \"yr.

It seems Rob Roy, when he came  to consider a little better of it, found that, he could not mend his  matters by retaining Killearn his prisoner, which could only expose him  still the more to the justice of the Government; and therefore thought  fit to dismiss him on Sunday evening last, having kept him from the  Monday night before, under a very uneasy kind of restraint, being obliged  to change continually from place to place. He gave him back the books,  papers, and bonds, but kept the money.    \"I am, with great truth, Sir,  \"your most humble servant,  \"MONTROSE.\"    [Some papers connected with Rob Roy Macgregor, signed \"Ro.

One of these  is a kind of contract between the Duke of Montrose and Rob Roy, by which  the latter undertakes to deliver within a given time \"Sixtie good and  sufficient Kintaill highland Cowes, betwixt the age of five and nine  years, at fourtene pounds Scotts per peice, with ane bull to the bargane,  and that at the head dykes of Buchanan upon the twenty-eight day of May  next.\"--Dated December 1711.--See _Proceedings,_ vol. vii. p. 253.]          No. III.--CHALLENGE BY ROB ROY.    \"Rob Roy _to ain hie and mighty Prince,_ James Duke of Montrose.    \"In charity to your Grace's couradge and conduct, please know, the only  way to retrive both is to treat Rob Roy like himself, in appointing tyme,  place, and choice of arms, that at once you may extirpate your inveterate  enemy, or put a period to your punny (puny?) life in falling gloriously  by his hands.

This saves your Grace and the troops any further trouble of searching;  that is, if your ambition of glory press you to embrace this unequald  venture offerd of Rob's head. But if your Grace's piety, prudence, and  cowardice, forbids hazarding this gentlemanly expedient, then let your  desire of peace restore what you have robed from me by the tyranny of  your present cituation, otherwise your overthrow as a man is determined;  and advertise your friends never more to look for the frequent civility  payed them, of sending them home without their arms only.

The seal, _a stag_--no bad emblem of a wild cateran.    It appears from the envelope that Rob Roy still continued to act as  Intelligencer to the Duke of Argyle, and his agents. The war he alludes  to is probably some vague report of invasion from Spain. Such rumours  were likely enough to be afloat, in consequence of the disembarkation of  the troops who were taken at Glensheal in the preceding year, 1718.          No. IV.--LETTER    FROM ROBERT CAMPBELL, _alias_ M'GREGOR,  COMMONLY CALLED ROB ROY, TO FIELD-MARSHAL WADE,    Then receiving the submission of disaffected Chieftains and Clans.*    * This curious epistle is copied from an authentic narrative of Marshal  Wade's proceedings in the Highlands, communicated by the late eminent  antiquary, George Chalmers, Esq., to Mr. Robert Jamieson, of the Register  House, Edinburgh, and  published in the Appendix to an Edition of Burt's  Letters from the North of Scotland, 2 vols. 8vo, Edinburgh, 1818.    Sir,--The great humanity with which you have constantly acted in the  discharge of the trust reposed in you, and your ever having made use of  the great powers with which you were vested as the means of doing good  and charitable offices to such as ye found proper objects of compassion,  will, I hope, excuse my importunity in endeavouring to approve myself not  absolutely unworthy of that mercy and favour which your Excellency has so  generously procured from his Majesty for others in my unfortunate  circumstances. I am very sensible nothing can be alledged sufficient to  excuse so great a crime as I have been guilty of it, that of Rebellion.  But I humbly beg leave to lay before your Excellency some particulars in  the circumstance of my guilt, which, I hope, will extenuate it in some  measure. It was my misfortune, at the time the Rebellion broke out, to be  liable to legal diligence and caption, at the Duke of Montrose's  instance, for debt alledged due to him. To avoid being flung into prison,  as I must certainly have been, had I followed my real inclinations in  joining the King's troops at Stirling, I was forced to take party with  the adherents of the Pretender; for the country being all in arms, it was  neither safe nor indeed possible for me to stand neuter. I should not,  however, plead my being forced into that unnatural rebellion against his  Majesty, King George, if I could not at the same time assure your  Excellency, that I not only avoided acting offensively against his  Majesty's forces upon all occasions, but on the contrary, sent his Grace  the Duke of Argyle all the intelligence I could from time to time, of the  strength and situation of the rebels; which I hope his Grace will do me  the justice to acknowledge. As to the debt to the Duke of Montrose, I  have discharged it to the utmost farthing.

Donald began to attend Sunday School early in years. Often on Sunday  mornings he would get ready for Sunday School after a sleepless night.  Wild parties were a part of the ungodly life we lived in our home.  Sometimes I took him to the church house door and there he would beg me  to come in and meet the Christian people who, he said, would be so glad  to see me.    Donald learned much of the Scriptures. He would pray and ask God's  blessings at the table. In Aug. 1932 we were living in Minneapolis. One  evening in particular I shall not forget. I was in an apartment below  the one in which we lived, partaking in a drunken party. Donald was then  12 years old. He suffered over my sins and came to the door to call me.  I promised him to come up soon, but I continued on for some hours with  the drunken crowd. When I did come up to our apartment I found Donald  on his knees by his bed with his Testament and an old hymn book of my  mother-in-law's. The books were open on the bed. He looked up through  his tears and said, \"Mother, I am praying for you.\" I looked at the  Testament and hymnal which were wet with tears that he had shed for his  ungodly mother. On September 15th, following this experience I went to  a mission. That night a group of Christians united in asking God for my  soul. When the song, \"Lord, I'm coming home,\" was sung after the service  I made my way to the altar. While kneeling there I felt someone very  close to my side. It was Donald who was praying for his mother. God heard  my prayer to be saved. He was merciful and washed away my sins. Psalm  51 has become precious to me.    God saved me for service. I marvel at his grace and mercy toward me. I  cannot cease to thank Him for picking me up out of the miry clay. I am  thankful also for my little boy who never ceased to pray for his mother.  Now, my life is in God's hands. I want to help others find the Savior.  I am especially burdened for others in the bondage of sin as I was. But  even more than that, I am burdened for children who have no opportunity  of knowing Jesus as their personal Savior."]]]
