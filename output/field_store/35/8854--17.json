Guided by Lincoln's  hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the  people.    The hall was a vast and intricate space--galleries, balconies, broad  spaces of amphitheatral steps, and great archways. Far away, high up,  seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity. The  whole multitude was swaying in congested masses. Individual figures  sprang out of the tumult, impressed him momentarily, and lost definition  again. Close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by  three men, her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff. Next  this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in  the crush with difficulty, and behind shouted a hairless face, a  great cavity of toothless mouth. A voice called that enigmatical word  \"Ostrog.\" All his impressions were vague save the massive emotion  of that trampling song. The multitude were beating time with their  feet--marking time, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The green weapons waved,  flashed and slanted. Then he saw those nearest to him on a level space  before the stage were marching in front of him, passing towards a great  archway, shouting \"To the Council!\" Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. He  raised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled. He remembered he had to  shout \"March!\" His mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. He waved his arm  again and pointed to the archway, shouting \"Onward!\" They were no longer  marking time, they were marching; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. In that  host were bearded men, old men, youths, fluttering robed bare-armed  women, girls. Men and women of the new age! Rich robes, grey rags  fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant  blue. A monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right. He perceived  a blue-clad negro, a shrivelled woman in yellow, then a group of tall  fair-haired, white-faced, blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him.  He noted two Chinamen. A tall, sallow, dark-haired, shining-eyed youth,  white clad from top to toe, clambered up towards the platform shouting  loyally, and sprang down again and receded, looking backward. Heads,  shoulders, hands clutching weapons, all were swinging with those  marching cadences.    Faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his  and passed and vanished. Men gesticulated to him, shouted inaudible  personal things. Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly  white. And disease was there, and many a hand that waved to him was  gaunt and lean. Men and women of the new age! Strange and incredible  meeting! As the broad stream passed before him to the right, tributary  gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an  incessant replacement of people; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The unison  of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches  and passages. Men and women mingled in the ranks; tramp, tramp, tramp,  tramp. The whole world seemed marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his  brain was tramping. The garments waved onward, the faces poured by more  abundantly.      Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln's pressure he turned towards the  archway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his  movement for the melody and stir of it. The multitude, the gesture and  song, all moved in that direction, the flow of people smote downward  until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet. He was aware  of a path before him, of a suite about him, of guards and dignities, and  Lincoln on his right hand. Attendants intervened, and ever and again  blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left. Before him went the  backs of the guards in black--three and three and three. He was marched  along a little railed way, and crossed above the archway, with the  torrent dipping to flow beneath, and shouting up to him. He did not  know whither he went; he did not want to know. He glanced back across a  flaming spaciousness of hall. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.        CHAPTER X. THE BATTLE OF THE DARKNESS    He was no longer in the hall. He was marching along a gallery  overhanging one of the great streets of the moving platforms that  traversed the city. Before him and behind him tramped his guards. The  whole concave of the moving ways below was a congested mass of people  marching, tramping to the left, shouting, waving hands and arms, pouring  along a huge vista, shouting as they came into view, shouting as they  passed, shouting as they receded, until the globes of electric light  receding in perspective dropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bare  heads. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.    The song roared up to Graham now, no longer upborne by music, but coarse  and noisy, and the beating of the marching feet, tramp, tramp, tramp,  tramp, interwove with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the  undisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways.    Abruptly he noted a contrast. The buildings on the opposite side of the  way seemed deserted, the cables and bridges that laced across the aisle  were empty and shadowy. It came into Graham's mind that these also  should have swarmed with people.    He felt a curious emotion--throbbing--very fast! He stopped again. The  guards before him marched on; those about him stopped as he did. He saw  the direction of their faces. The throbbing had something to do with the  lights. He too looked up.    At first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights simply, an  isolated phenomenon, having no bearing on the things below. Each huge  globe of blinding whiteness was as it were clutched, compressed in a  systole that was followed by a transitory diastole, and again a systole  like a tightening grip, darkness, light, darkness, in rapid alternation.    Graham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to  do with the people below. The appearance of the houses and ways, the  appearance of the packed masses changed, became a confusion of vivid  lights and leaping shadows. He saw a multitude of shadows had sprung  into aggressive existence, seemed rushing up, broadening, widening,  growing with steady swiftness--to leap suddenly back and return  reinforced. The song and the tramping had ceased. The unanimous march,  he discovered, was arrested, there were eddies, a flow sideways, shouts  of \"The lights!\" Voices were crying together one thing. \"The lights!\"  cried these voices. \"The lights!\" He looked down. In this dancing death  of the lights the area of the street had suddenly become a monstrous  struggle. The huge white globes became purple-white, purple with a  reddish glow, flickered, flickered faster and faster, fluttered between  light and extinction, ceased to flicker and became mere fading specks  of glowing red in a vast obscurity. In ten seconds the extinction  was accomplished, and there was only this roaring darkness, a black  monstrosity that had suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of  men.    He felt invisible forms about him; his arms were gripped. Something  rapped sharply against his shin. A voice bawled in his ear, \"It is all  right--all right.\"    Graham shook off the paralysis of his first astonishment. He struck his  forehead against Lincoln's and bawled, \"What is this darkness?\"    \"The Council has cut the currents that light the city. We must  wait--stop. The people will go on. They will--\"    His voice was drowned. Voices were shouting, \"Save the Sleeper. Take  care of the Sleeper.\" A guard stumbled against Graham and hurt his hand  by an inadvertent blow of his weapon. A wild tumult tossed and whirled  about him, growing, as it seemed, louder, denser, more furious each  moment. Fragments of recognisable sounds drove towards him, were whirled  away from him as his mind reached out to grasp them. Voices seemed to be  shouting conflicting orders, other voices answered. There were suddenly  a succession of piercing screams close beneath them.    A voice bawled in his ear, \"The red police,\" and receded forthwith  beyond his questions.    A crackling sound grew to distinctness, and there with a leaping of  faint flashes along the edge of the further ways. By their light Graham  saw the heads and bodies of a number of men, armed with weapons like  those of his guards, leap into an instant's dim visibility. The whole  area began to crackle, to flash with little instantaneous streaks of  light, and abruptly the darkness rolled back like a curtain.    A glare of light dazzled his eyes, a vast seething expanse of struggling  men confused his mind. A shout, a burst of cheering, came across the  ways. He looked up to see the source of the light. A man hung far  overhead from the upper part of a cable, holding by a rope the blinding  star that had driven the darkness back. He wore a red uniform.    Graham's eyes fell to the ways again. A wedge of red a little way along  the vista caught his eye. He saw it was a dense mass of red-clad men  jammed the higher further way, their backs against the pitiless cliff  of building, and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists. They were  fighting. Weapons flashed and rose and fell, heads vanished at the edge  of the contest, and other heads replaced them, the little flashes from  the green weapons became little jets of smoky grey while the light  lasted.    Abruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways were an inky darkness  once more, a tumultuous mystery.    He felt something thrusting against him. He was being pushed along the  gallery. Someone was shouting--it might be at him. He was too confused  to hear. He was thrust against the wall, and a number of people  blundered past him. It seemed to him that his guards were struggling  with one another.    Suddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again, and the whole scene  was white and dazzling.

The inhabitants in the Bay of Islands were found to be far more  numerous than in any other part of New Zealand which Lieutenant Cook  had hitherto visited. It did not appear that they were united under  one head; and, though their towns were fortified, they seemed to live  together in perfect amity.    The Endeavour on the 9th of December, lying becalmed in Doubtless Bay,  an opportunity was taken to inquire of the natives concerning their  country; and our navigators learned from them, by the help of Tupia,  that at the distance of three days' rowing in their canoes, at a place  called Moore-Whennua, the land would take a short turn to the  southward, and thence extend no more to the west. This place the  English gentlemen concluded to be the land discovered by Tasman, and  which had been named by him Cape Maria van Diemen. The lieutenant,  finding the inhabitants so intelligent, inquired further, if they knew  of any country besides their own. To this they answered, that they had  never visited any other; but that their ancestors had told them, that  there was a country of great extent, to the north-west by north, or  north-north west, called Ulimaroa, to which some people had sailed in  a very large canoe; and that only a part of them had returned, who  reported, that, after a passage of a month, they had seen a country  where the people eat hogs.    On the 30th of December, our navigators saw the land, which they  judged to be Cape Maria van Diemen, and which corresponded with the  account that had been given of it by the Indians. The next day, from  the appearance of Mount Camel, they had a demonstration that, where  they now were, the breadth of New Zealand could not be more than two  or three miles from sea to sea. During this part of the navigation,  two particulars occurred which are very remarkable. In latitude 35 deg. S.  and in the midst of summer, Lieutenant Cook met with a gale of wind,  which, from its strength and continuance, was such as he had scarcely  ever been in before: and he was three weeks in getting ten leagues to  the westward, and five weeks in getting fifty leagues; for at this  time being the 1st of January, 1770, it was so long since he had  passed Cape Bret. While the gale lasted, our voyagers ware happily at  a considerable distance from the land; since, otherwise, it was highly  probable that they would never have returned to relate their  adventures.    The shore at Queen Charlotte's Sound, where the English had arrived on  the 14th of January, seemed to form several bays, into one of which  the lieutenant proposed to carry the ship, which was now become very  foul, in order to careen her, to repair some defects, and to obtain a  recruit of wood and water. At day-break, the next morning, he stood in  for an inlet, and at eight got within the entrance. At nine o'clock,  there being little wind, and what there was being variable, the  Endeavour was carried by the tide or current within two cables' length  of the north-west shore where she had fifty-four fathom water. By the  help, of the boats she was gotten clear; and about two, our people  anchored in a very safe and convenient cove. Soon after, Mr. Cook,  with most of the gentlemen, landed upon the coast, where they found a  fine stream of excellent water, and wood in the greatest plenty.  Indeed the land, in this part of the country, was one forest, of vast  extent. As the gentlemen had brought the seine with them, it was  hauled once or twice; and with such success, that different sorts of  fish were caught amounting nearly to three hundred weight. The equal  distribution of these among the ship's company, furnished them with a  very agreeable refreshment.    When Lieutenant Cook, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and some others,  landed on the 16th, they met with an Indian family, among whom they  found horrid and indisputable proofs of the custom of eating human  flesh. Not to resume so disagreeable a subject, it may here be  observed once for all, that evidences of the same custom appeared on  various occasions.    On the next day a delightful object engaged the attention of our  voyagers. The ship lying at the distance of somewhat less than a  quarter of a mile from the shore, they were awakened by the singing of  an incredible number of birds, who seemed to strain their throats in  emulation of each other. This wild melody was infinitely superior to  any they had ever heard of the same kind, and seemed to be like small  bells, most exquisitely tuned. It is probable, that the distance, and  the water between, might be of no small advantage to the sound. Upon  inquiry, the gentlemen were informed, that the birds here always began  to sing about two hours after midnight; and that, continuing their  music till sunrise, they were silent the rest of the day. In this last  respect they resembled the nightingales of our own country.    On the 18th, Lieutenant Cook went out in the pinnace to take a view of  the bay in which the ship was now at anchor; and found it to be of  great extent, consisting of numberless small harbours and coves, in  every direction. The lieutenant confined his excursion to the western  side, and the coast where he landed being an impenetrable forest,  nothing could be seen worthy of notice. As our commander and his  friends were returning, they saw a single man in a canoe fishing:  rowing up to him, to their great surprise, he took not the least  notice of them; and even when they were alongside of him, continued to  follow his occupation, without adverting to them any more than if they  had been invisible. This behaviour was not, however the result either  of sullenness or stupidity; for upon being requested to draw up his  net, that it might be examined, he readily complied. He shewed  likewise to our people his mode of fishing, which was simple and  ingenious.    When, on the 19th, the armourer's forge was set up, and all hands on  board were busy in careening, and in other necessary operations about  the vessel, some Indians, who had brought plenty of fish, exchanged  them for nails, of which they had now begun to perceive the use and  value. This may be considered as one instance in which they were  enlightened and benefited by their intercourse with our navigators.    While, on the 22d, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander employed themselves in  botanizing near the beach, our commander, taking a seaman with him,  ascended one of the hills of the country. Upon reaching its summit, he  found the view of the inlet, the head of which he had a little before  in vain attempted to discover in the pinnace, intercepted by hills  still higher than that on which he stood, and which were rendered  inaccessible by impenetrable woods. He was, however, amply rewarded  for his labour; for he saw the sea on the eastern side of the country,  and a passage leading from it to that on the west, a little to the  eastward of the entrance of the inlet where the ship lay. The main  land, which was on the south-east side of this inlet, appeared to be a  narrow ridge of very high hills, and to form part of the south-west  side of the strait. On the opposite side, the land trended away east  as far as the eye could reach; and to the south-east there was  discerned an opening to the sea, which washes the eastern coast. The  lieutenant saw also, on the east side of the inlet, some islands which  he had before taken to be part of the main land. In returning to the  ship, he examined the harbours and coves that lie behind the islands  which he had seen from the hills. The next day was employed by him in  further surveys and discoveries.    During a visit to the Indians, on the 24th, Tupia being of the party,  they were observed to be continually talking of guns and shooting  people. For this subject of their conversation, the English gentlemen  could not at all account. But, after perplexing themselves with  various conjectures, they at length learned, that, on the 21st, one of  our officers, under the pretence of going out to fish, had rowed up to  a hippah, or village, on the coast. When he had done so, two or three  canoes coming off towards his boat, his fears suggested that an attack  was intended, in consequence of which three muskets were fired, one  with small shot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with  the utmost precipitation. It is highly probable, that they had come  out with friendly intentions, for such intentions were expressed by  their behaviour, both before and afterwards. This action of the  officer exhibited a fresh instance, how little some of the people  under Lieutenant Cook had imbibed of the wise, discreet, and humane  spirit of their commander.    On the morning of the 26th, the lieutenant went again out in the boat,  with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which  lie on the east side of the inlet, in order to obtain another sight of  the strait which passed between the eastern and western seas. Having  landed, for this purpose, at a convenient place, they climbed a hill  of very considerable height, from which they had a full view of the  strait, with the land on the opposite shore, which they judged to be  about four leagues distant. As it was hazy in the horizon, they could  not see far to the south-east; but Mr. Cook saw enough to determine  him to search the passage with the ship as soon as he should put to  sea. The gentlemen found, on the top of the hill, a parcel of loose  stones, with which they erected a pyramid, and left in it some musket  balls, small shot, beads, and such other things, which they happened  to have about them, as were likely to stand the test of time. These,  not being of Indian workmanship, would convince any European, who  should come to the place and pull it down, that natives of Europe had  been there before."]]]
