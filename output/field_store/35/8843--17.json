The officer was making excited motions with a gauntleted hand.  The guns followed the teams with an air of unwillingness, of being  dragged by the heels.    Some officers of the scattered infantry were cursing and railing like  fishwives.  Their scolding voices could be heard above the din.  Into  the unspeakable jumble in the roadway rode a squadron of cavalry.  The  faded yellow of their facings shone bravely.  There was a mighty  altercation.    The artillery were assembling as if for a conference.    The blue haze of evening was upon the field.  The lines of forest were  long purple shadows.  One cloud lay along the western sky partly  smothering the red.    As the youth left the scene behind him, he heard the guns suddenly roar  out.  He imagined them shaking in black rage.  They belched and howled  like brass devils guarding a gate.  The soft air was filled with the  tremendous remonstrance.  With it came the shattering peal of opposing  infantry.  Turning to look behind him, he could see sheets of orange  light illumine the shadowy distance.  There were subtle and sudden  lightnings in the far air.  At times he thought he could see heaving  masses of men.    He hurried on in the dusk.  The day had faded until he could barely  distinguish place for his feet.  The purple darkness was filled with  men who lectured and jabbered.  Sometimes he could see them  gesticulating against the blue and somber sky.  There seemed to be a  great ruck of men and munitions spread about in the forest and in the  fields.    The little narrow roadway now lay lifeless.  There were overturned  wagons like sun-dried bowlders.  The bed of the former torrent was  choked with the bodies of horses and splintered parts of war machines.    It had come to pass that his wound pained him but little.  He was  afraid to move rapidly, however, for a dread of disturbing it.  He held  his head very still and took many precautions against stumbling.  He  was filled with anxiety, and his face was pinched and drawn in  anticipation of the pain of any sudden mistake of his feet in the gloom.    His thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently upon his hurt.  There was a  cool, liquid feeling about it and he imagined blood moving slowly down  under his hair.  His head seemed swollen to a size that made him think  his neck to be inadequate.    The new silence of his wound made much worriment.  The little  blistering voices of pain that had called out from his scalp were, he  thought, definite in their expression of danger.  By them he believed  he could measure his plight.  But when they remained ominously silent  he became frightened and imagined terrible fingers that clutched into  his brain.    Amid it he began to reflect upon various incidents and conditions of  the past.  He bethought him of certain meals his mother had cooked at  home, in which those dishes of which he was particularly fond had  occupied prominent positions.  He saw the spread table.  The pine walls  of the kitchen were glowing in the warm light from the stove.  Too, he  remembered how he and his companions used to go from the school-house  to the bank of a shaded pool.  He saw his clothes in disorderly array  upon the grass of the bank.  He felt the swash of the fragrant water  upon his body.  The leaves of the overhanging maple rustled with melody  in the wind of youthful summer.    He was overcome presently by a dragging weariness.  His head hung  forward and his shoulders were stooped as if he were bearing a great  bundle.  His feet shuffled along the ground.    He held continuous arguments as to whether he should lie down and sleep  at some near spot, or force himself on until he reached a certain  haven.  He often tried to dismiss the question, but his body persisted  in rebellion and his senses nagged at him like pampered babies.    At last he heard a cheery voice near his shoulder: \"Yeh seem t' be in a  pretty bad way, boy?\"    The youth did not look up, but he assented with thick tongue. \"Uh!\"    The owner of the cheery voice took him firmly by the arm.  \"Well,\" he  said, with a round laugh, \"I'm goin' your way.  Th' hull gang is goin'  your way.  An' I guess I kin give yeh a lift.\"  They began to walk like  a drunken man and his friend.    As they went along, the man questioned the youth and assisted him with  the replies like one manipulating the mind of a child.  Sometimes he  interjected anecdotes.  \"What reg'ment do yeh b'long teh?  Eh?  What 's  that?  Th' 304th N' York?  Why, what corps is that in?  Oh, it is?  Why, I thought they wasn't engaged t'-day-they 're 'way over in th'  center.  Oh, they was, eh?  Well pretty nearly everybody got their  share 'a fightin' t'-day.  By dad, I give myself up fer dead any number  'a times.  There was shootin' here an' shootin' there, an' hollerin'  here an' hollerin' there, in th' damn' darkness, until I couldn't tell  t' save m' soul which side I was on.  Sometimes I thought I was sure  'nough from Ohier, an' other times I could 'a swore I was from th'  bitter end of Florida.  It was th' most mixed up dern thing I ever see.  An' these here hull woods is a reg'lar mess.  It 'll be a miracle if we  find our reg'ments t'-night.  Pretty soon, though, we 'll meet a-plenty  of guards an' provost-guards, an' one thing an' another.  Ho!  there  they go with an off'cer, I guess.  Look at his hand a-draggin'.  He 's  got all th' war he wants, I bet.  He won't be talkin' so big about his  reputation an' all when they go t' sawin' off his leg.  Poor feller!  My brother 's got whiskers jest like that.  How did yeh git 'way over  here, anyhow?  Your reg'ment is a long way from here, ain't it?  Well,  I guess we can find it.  Yeh know there was a boy killed in my comp'ny  t'-day that I thought th' world an' all of.  Jack was a nice feller.  By ginger, it hurt like thunder t' see ol' Jack jest git knocked flat.  We was a-standin' purty peaceable fer a spell, 'though there was men  runnin' ev'ry way all 'round us, an' while we was a-standin' like that,  'long come a big fat feller.  He began t' peck at Jack's elbow, an' he  ses:  'Say, where 's th' road t' th' river?' An' Jack, he never paid no  attention, an' th' feller kept on a-peckin' at his elbow an' sayin':  'Say, where 's th' road t' th' river?' Jack was a-lookin' ahead all th'  time tryin' t' see th' Johnnies comin' through th' woods, an' he never  paid no attention t' this big fat feller fer a long time, but at last  he turned 'round an' he ses:  'Ah, go t' hell an' find th' road t' th'  river!' An' jest then a shot slapped him bang on th' side th' head.  He  was a sergeant, too.  Them was his last words.  Thunder, I wish we was  sure 'a findin' our reg'ments t'-night.  It 's goin' t' be long  huntin'.  But I guess we kin do it.\"    In the search which followed, the man of the cheery voice seemed to the  youth to possess a wand of a magic kind.  He threaded the mazes of the  tangled forest with a strange fortune.  In encounters with guards and  patrols he displayed the keenness of a detective and the valor of a  gamin.  Obstacles fell before him and became of assistance.  The youth,  with his chin still on his breast, stood woodenly by while his  companion beat ways and means out of sullen things.    The forest seemed a vast hive of men buzzing about in frantic circles,  but the cheery man conducted the youth without mistakes, until at last  he began to chuckle with glee and self-satisfaction.  \"Ah, there yeh  are!  See that fire?\"    The youth nodded stupidly.    \"Well, there 's where your reg'ment is.  An' now, good-by, ol' boy,  good luck t' yeh.\"    A warm and strong hand clasped the youth's languid fingers for an  instant, and then he heard a cheerful and audacious whistling as the  man strode away.  As he who had so befriended him was thus passing out  of his life, it suddenly occurred to the youth that he had not once  seen his face.          Chapter 13      The youth went slowly toward the fire indicated by his departed friend.  As he reeled, he bethought him of the welcome his comrades would give  him.  He had a conviction that he would soon feel in his sore heart the  barbed missiles of ridicule.  He had no strength to invent a tale; he  would be a soft target.    He made vague plans to go off into the deeper darkness and hide, but  they were all destroyed by the voices of exhaustion and pain from his  body.  His ailments, clamoring, forced him to seek the place of food  and rest, at whatever cost.    He swung unsteadily toward the fire.  He could see the forms of men  throwing black shadows in the red light, and as he went nearer it  became known to him in some way that the ground was strewn with  sleeping men.    Of a sudden he confronted a black and monstrous figure.  A rifle barrel  caught some glinting beams.  \"Halt! halt!\"  He was dismayed for a  moment, but he presently thought that he recognized the nervous voice.  As he stood tottering before the rifle barrel, he called out:  \"Why,  hello, Wilson, you--you here?\"    The rifle was lowered to a position of caution and the loud soldier  came slowly forward.  He peered into the youth's face.  \"That you,  Henry?\"    \"Yes, it's--it's me.\"    \"Well, well, ol' boy,\" said the other, \"by ginger, I'm glad t' see yeh!  I give yeh up fer a goner.  I thought yeh was dead sure enough.\"  There  was husky emotion in his voice.    The youth found that now he could barely stand upon his feet.  There  was a sudden sinking of his forces.  He thought he must hasten to  produce his tale to protect him from the missiles already on the lips  of his redoubtable comrades.  So, staggering before the loud soldier,  he began:  \"Yes, yes.  I've--I've had an awful time.  I've been all  over.  Way over on th' right.  Ter'ble fightin' over there.  I had an  awful time.  I got separated from the reg'ment.  Over on th' right, I  got shot.

Populism never has played in Colorado the part that  it has in Kansas, but \"anything for free coinage\" has been the motto, and  in abiding by it the State brought in, and afterward turned out, Gov.  Waite, of disgraceful memory. Again, last year, there was Republican-  Democratic-Populist fusion to beat the gold standard, and much Populist  rule was again the result. One good authority writes me that women \"have  introduced an element of order and respectability upon election day that  was never observed before.\" He says he thinks that, \"as a whole, the  people are very much satisfied with woman suffrage and believe that it has  resulted beneficially in so far as it has made politics a little better  than they were.\" Another says that \"the influence of woman in politics did  not prevent the last Republican caucus of Arapahoe Co. from being the most  disgraceful in the history of the State. The Convention, though presided  over by a woman, was completely in the power of the 'gang,' and sent to  Pueblo the most unworthy delegate ever sent.\" This gentleman also says he  has \"heard numbers of intelligent women state that they were sorry the  ballot had ever been given to them.\" Orderliness at the ordinary elections  is expected here, without calling upon women to act as \"moral police\" at  the polls. So quiet are they that it has been found practicable to place  coffee-stands in charge of women near some of the booths, when women have  requested it in the hope of preventing drunkenness. A friend said to me  some time ago: \"You know that I have been a Suffragist. I am most  thoroughly converted. I have been three months in Colorado. It is enough  to cure any one.\"    A Denver correspondent of the \"Chicago Record,\" says: \"The women of  Colorado took no active part in the recent campaign, but they did not  forget to vote.... The experiment of having women in the State Assembly  did not prove satisfactory, at the last session, and it was quite  generally conceded that there would be no more women sent to that body;  but the Populists won in this county, and on their ticket were three woman  candidates, so the coming session will again have three women as members.\"    Of course the effect of suffrage in new States is not a criterion of its  effect elsewhere. And whether the effect could be shown to be good or bad,  the main argument would not be touched. The interesting thing to trace is  the affiliations of the movement.      In addition to those that have been mentioned we recall the fact that in  our recent political campaign, four parties that nominated candidates for  President and Vice-President of the United States, had in their  conventions women as delegates and members of committees. They were the  Populist, the Free-Silver, the Prohibition, and the Socialist-Labor  parties. The woman-suffragists of the Prohibition party left the rock-  ribbed champion that had put a Suffrage plank in every platform for years,  in order to go with Free Silver and Populism of the most extravagant type.  These parties also had Suffrage planks. Altgeld and Debs, Coxey and  Tillman were only men, but Mary Ellen Lease furnished to the campaign that  strain of exalted fanaticism that at once points out woman's glory and  woman's danger.    The Suffrage indictment we have been considering is summed up as follows:  \"Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one half of the people of  this country, their social and religious degradation--in view of the  unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves  aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred  rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and  privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United States.\"    Dr. Jacobi in \"Common Sense\" says: \"To this very day the survivors of that  group of pioneer women have an abstract way of stating their claim which,  to modern ears, sounds somewhat archaic.\"    She is not archaic when she says: \"During the long ages of class rule,  which are just beginning to cease, only one form of sovereignty has been  assigned to all men--that, namely, over all women. Upon these feeble and  inferior companions all men were permitted to avenge the indignities they  suffered from so many men to whom they were forced to submit.\"    Mary A. Livermore is not archaic when in the \"North American Review\" for  February, 1896, she says: \"Her physical weakness, and not alone her mental  inferiority, has made her the subject of man. Toiling patiently for him,  cheerfully sharing with him all his perils and hardships, the  unappreciated mother of his children, she has been bought and sold, petted  and tortured, according to the whims of her brutal owner, the victim  everywhere of pillage, lust, war, and servitude. And this statement  includes all races and peoples of the earth from the date of their  historic existence.\"    I deny the truthfulness of the archaic accusation, and denounce as an  absurdity the bombastic demand. I resent, as an unwarranted insult to  woman and to man, the still more bitter modern representations of woman's  condition and woman's rights in this world, and especially in this  Republic. They are simply false.    Archaic or modern, the dictums of the Suffrage pioneers have been repeated  at their every convention. Overlaid with sentiment as much of the Suffrage  idea has become, contradictory as it is in argument and in statement of  fact, blended as are its sophisms with the real progress of the time,  sincere and well-meaning as are many of its advocates, sex antagonism is  the corner-stone of its foundation. The Woman's Rebellion is a more  complex affair than the American Revolution. The latter was the natural  result of the earnest and united protest, by a large majority of men and  women of the American Colonies, against the tyranny of a monarchical  government. The former was a protest by a small band of women and men  against what they claimed to be universal tyranny. They attacked law and  custom all along the line, and the weapon forever kept in order for the  service was the demand for woman's possession of the ballot. Where she  does not possess it, and has not asked it, her influence is mightiest. The  relation of woman to the Republic is a study worthy the most exalted  patriotism. In it is involved the broader question of her relation to man  and to the destiny of the race. When told of her son's heroism in crossing  the Delaware, Mary Washington said, \"George will not forget the lessons I  have taught him.\" Through the mother's devoted faith and the son's  obedient power, the foundations were laid of a government whose sole  reliance must still be on woman's inspiration and man's willing strength.  These are evidently God's instruments for our Nation's upbuilding.          CHAPTER IV.      WOMAN SUFFRAGE AND PHILANTHROPY.      The extinction of human bondage, more perhaps than any other one event,  has emphasized the progress of the century about to close. Our generation  has witnessed the destruction of serfdom in Russia, and of slavery in  Brazil and the United States. Freedom was gained; but of the enlightened  rulers through whom it was won, two were assassinated and one was exiled  to die. Sacrifice is still the price of liberty.    Much stress has been laid by Suffragists upon the supposed fact that the  Woman-suffrage movement grew up as a logical conclusion from the Anti-  slavery movement. It grew out of it in the sense of having been born in  its midst; but I believe that the truth will be found to be that it was  the most prolific source of the dissensions that marred that noble cause,  and was identified with the small element that adopted wild notions or  used the notoriety gained by opposition to slavery in order to propagate  mischief. The conduct of those who later entered the Suffrage movement  hindered the public work of women from the time of organized effort for  the slave until slavery fell pierced to death amid the horrors of a  fratricidal war. I will take a brief survey of the Anti-slavery struggle  as it blended itself with the doctrines of those abolitionists who were  the earliest and staunchest friends of the Suffrage movement, and compare  it with the statements and claims of the women themselves.    I first refer to the \"Life of James G. Birney,\" by his son, General  William Birney. James G. Birney was an early friend of Henry B. Stanton,  husband of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and with him helped to lay the  foundations of the Free-Soil Party, and later the Republican Party.  General Birney says of his father: \"In his visit to New York and New  England, in May and June, 1837, Mr. Birney's chief object had been to  restore harmony among Anti-slavery leaders on doctrines and measures, and  especially to check a tendency, already marked in Massachusetts, to burden  the cause with irrelevant reforms, real or supposed. With this view he had  attended the New England Anti-slavery Convention held at Boston, May 30 to  June 2 inclusive, accepted the position of one of its vice-presidents, and  acted as a member of its committee on business. Rev. Henry C. Wright, the  leader of the No-Human-Government, Woman's-Rights, and Moral-Reform  factions, was a member of the Convention, but received no appointment on  any committee. On June 23, in the 'Liberator' [his newspaper], Mr.  Garrison denounced human governments. July 4, he spoke at Providence, as  if approvingly, of the overthrow of the Nation, the dismemberment of the  Union, and the dashing in pieces of the Church. July 15, an association,  of Congregational ministers issued a 'pastoral letter' against the new  doctrines. August 2, five clergymen, claiming to represent nine tenths of  the abolitionists of Massachusetts, published an 'appeal' which was  directed more especially against the"]]]
