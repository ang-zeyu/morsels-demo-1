He began by bringing in a piece of pine wood that  had drifted down the river, which he split into small pieces with a  wedge made of the elk's horn by means of a mallet of stone curiously  carved. The pieces were then laid on the fire, and several round  stones placed upon them. One of the squaws now brought a bucket of  water, in which was a large salmon about half dried, and as the  stones became heated they were put into the bucket till the salmon  was sufficiently boiled for use. It was then taken out, put on a  platter of rushes neatly made, and laid before Captain Clarke, and  another was boiled for each of his men.\" [Footnote: Travels, p. 353.]    One or two additional cases of which a large number are mentioned by  these authors will sufficiently illustrate the practice of  hospitality of these tribes and its universality. They went to a  village of seven houses of the Chilluckittequaw tube and to the  house of the chief. \"He received us kindly,\" they remark, \"and set  before us pounded fish, filberts, nuts, the berries of the sacacommis,  and white bread made of roots.... The village is a part of the same  nation with the village we passed above, the language of the two  being the same, and their houses of similar form and materials, and  calculated to contain about thirty souls. The inhabitants were  unusually hospitable and good humored.\" [Footnote: Travels, etc.,  p. 375-376.]    While among the Shoshones, and before arriving at the Columbia they  \"reached an Indian lodge of brush inhabited by seven families of the  Shoshones. They behaved with great civility, and gave the whole  party as much boiled salmon as they could eat, and added a present  of several dried salmon and a considerable quantity of chokechinies;\"  [Footnote: ib. p. 288.] and Captain Lewis remarks of the same people,  that \"an Indian invited him into his bower, and gave him a small  morsel of boiled antelope, and a piece of fresh salmon roasted. This  was the first salmon he had seen, and perfectly satisfied him that  he was now on the waters of the Pacific.\" [Footnote: ib. p. 268.]    Thus far among the tribes we find a literal repetition of the rule  of hospitality as practiced by the Iroquois. Mr. Dall, speaking of  the Aleuts, says, \"hospitality was one of their prominent traits,\"  [Footnote: On the Remains of Later Prehistoric Man, Alaska Ter.  Smithsonian Cont., No. 318, p. 3. Travels, etc., Phila. ed., 1796,  p. 171.] and Powers, of the Pomo Indians of California remarks, that  \"they would always divide the last morsel of dried salmon with  genuine savage thriftlessness,\" and of the Mi-oal'-a-wa-gun, that,  \"like all California Indians they are very hospitable.\" [Footnote:  Powell's Contributions to North American Ethnology, Power's Tribes  of California, vol. iii. p. 153.]    Father Marquette and Lieutenant Joliet, who first discovered the  Upper Mississippi in 1673, had friendly intercourse with some of the  tribes on its eastern bank, and were hospitably entertained by them.  \"The council being over, we were invited to a feast, which consisted  of four dishes. The first was a dish of sagamite--that is, some  Indian meal boiled in water and seasoned with grease--the master of  ceremonies holding a spoonful of it, which he put thrice into my  mouth and then did the like to M. Joliet. The second dish consisted  of three fish, whereof he took a piece, and having taken out the  bones and blown upon it to cool it, he put it into my mouth. The  third dish was a large dog, which they had killed on purpose, but  understanding that we did not eat this animal they sent it away. The  fourth was a piece of buffalo meat, of which they put the fattest  pieces into our mouths.\" [Footnote: Historical Collections of  Louisiana. part ii. An Account of the Discovery of some New  Countries and Nations of North America in 1673, by Pere Marquette  and Sieur Joliet, p. 287.]    Lower down the river, below the mouth of the Ohio, they fell in with  another tribe, of whom they speak as follows. \"We therefore  disembarked and went to their village. They entertained us with  buffalo and bear's meat and white plums, which were excellent. We  observed they had guns, knives, axes, shovels, glass beads, and  bottles in which they put their powder. They wear their hair long as  the Iroquois, and their women are dressed as the Hurons.\"  [Footnote: ib,. p. 293]    In 1766 Jonathan Carver visited the Dakota tribes of the Mississippi,  the Sauks and Foxes, and Winnebagos of Wisconsin, and the Ojibwas of  Upper Michigan. He speaks generally of the hospitality of these  tribes as follows: \"No people are more hospitable, kind, and free  than the Indians. They will readily share with any of their own  tribe the last part of their provisions, and even with those  of a different nation, if they chance to come in when they are  eating. Though they do not keep one common stock, yet that  community of goods which is so prevalent among them, and their  generous disposition, render it nearly of the same effect.\"  [Footnote: Carver's Travels, etc. Phila. ed. 1796, p. 171.]    The \"community of goods, which is so prevalent among them,\" is  explained by their large households formed of related families, who  shared their provisions in common. The \"seven families of Shoshones\"  in one house, and also the houses \"crowded with men, women, and  children,\" mentioned by Lewis and Clarke, are fair samples of Indian  households in the early period.    We turn again to the southern tribes of the United States, the  Cherokees, Choctas, Chickasas, and Confederated Creek tribes. James  Adair, whose work was published in 1775, remarks generally upon  their usages in the following language. \"They are so hospitable,  kind-hearted, and free, that they would share with those of their  own tribe the last part of their own provisions, even to a single  ear of corn; and to others, if they called when they were eating;  for they have no stated meal time. An open generous temper is a  standing virtue among them; to be narrow-hearted, especially to  those in want, or to any of their own family, is accounted a great  crime, and to reflect scandal on the rest of the tribe. Such  wretched misers they brand with bad characters.... The Cherokee  Indians have a pointed proverbial expression to the same effect--  simtaweh ne wara, the great hawk is at home. However, it is a very  rare thing to find any of them of a narrow temper; and though they  do not keep one promiscuous common stock, yet it is to the very same  effect; for every one has his own family or tribe; and when one of  them is speaking, either of the individuals or habitations of any of  his tribe, he says, 'he is of my house,' or 'it is my house'....  When the Indians are traveling in their own country, they inquire  for a house of their own tribe [gens]; and if there be any, they go  to it, and are kindly received, though they never saw the persons  before--they eat, drink, and regale themselves with as much freedom  as at their own table, which is the solid ground covered with a  bear-skin.... Every town has a state-house or synedrion, as the  Jewish sanhedrim, where, almost every night, the head men convene  about public business; or the town's people to feast, sing, dance,  and rejoice in the divine presence, as will fully be described  hereafter. And if a stranger calls there, he is treated with the  greatest civility and hearty kindness--he is sure to find plenty of  their simple home fare, and a large cane-bed covered with the  softened skins of bears or buffaloes to sleep on. But, when his  lineage is known to the people (by a stated custom, they are slow in  greeting one another), his relations, if he has any there, address  him in a familiar way, invite him home, and treat him as a kinsman.\"  [Footnote: History of the American Indians, London ed., 1775, p. 17.]    All these tribes were organized in gentes or clans, and the gentes  of each tribe were usually reintegrated in two or more phratries. It  is the gens to which Mr. Adair refers when he speaks of the  \"family,\" \"relations,\" and \"lineage.\" We find among them the same  rule of hospitality, substantially, as prevailed among the Iroquois.    It is a reasonable conclusion, therefore, that among all the tribes,  north of New Mexico, the law of hospitality, as practiced by the  Iroquois, was universally recognized; and that in all Indian  villages and encampments without distinction the hungry were fed  through the open hospitality of those who possessed a surplus.  Notwithstanding this generous custom, it is well known that the  Northern Indians were often fearfully pressed for the means of  subsistence during a portion of each year. A bad season for their  limited productions, and the absence of accumulated stores, not  unfrequently engendered famine over large districts. From the  severity of the struggle for subsistence, it is not surprising that  immense areas were entirely uninhabited, that other large areas were  thinly peopled, and that dense population nowhere existed.    Among the Village Indians of New Mexico the same hospitality is now  extended to Americans visiting their pueblos, and which  presumptively is simply a reflection of their usage among themselves  and toward other tribes. In 1852 Dr. Tenbroeck, assistant surgeon  United States Army, accompanied his command to the Moki pueblos. In  his journal he remarks: \"Between eleven and twelve to-day we arrived  at the first towns of Moki. All the inhabitants turned out, crowding  the streets and house-tops to have a view of the white men. All the  old men pressed forward to shake hands with us, and we were most  hospitably received and conducted to the governor's house, where we  were at once feasted upon guavas and a leg of mutton broiled upon  the coals.

Norwood (Methuen)  contains a summary of the latest views on the art of the Athenian  dramatists.    See Symonds' _Greek Poets_ as above.          SOPHOCLES      In Aeschylus' dramas the will of the gods tended to override human  responsibility. An improvement could be effected by making the  personages real captains of their souls; drama needed bringing down from  heaven to earth. This process was effected by Sophocles. He was born at  Colonus, near Athens, in 495, mixed with the best society in Periclean  times, was a member of the important board of administrators who  controlled the Delian League, the nucleus of the Athenian Empire, and  composed over one hundred tragedies. In 468 he defeated Aeschylus,  won the first prize twenty-two times and later had to face the more  formidable opposition of the new and restless spirit whose chief  spokesman was Euripides. For nearly forty years he was taken to be the  typical dramatist of Athens, being nicknamed \"the Bee\"; his dramatic  powers showed no abatement of vigour in old age, of which the _Oedipus  Coloneus_ was the triumphant issue. He died in 405, full of years and  honours.    Providence has ordained it that his art, like his country's tutelary  goddess Athena, should step perfect and fully armed from the brain  of its creator. The _Antigone_, produced in 440, discusses one of the  deepest problems of civilised life. On the morning after the defeat  of the Seven who assaulted Thebes Polyneices' body lay dishonoured and  unburied, a prey to carrion birds before the gates of the city which had  been his home. His two sisters, Antigone and Ismene, discuss the edict  which forbids his burial. Ismene, the more timid of the two, intends to  obey it, but Antigone's stronger character rises in rebellion.    Loss of burial was the most awful fate which could overtake a  Greek--before he died Sophocles was to see his country condemn ten  generals to death for neglect of burial rites, though they had been  brilliantly successful in a naval engagement. Rather than obey Antigone  would die.        \"Bury him I will; I will lie in death with the brother I love,      sinning in a righteous cause. Far longer is the time in which I      must please the dead than men on earth, for among the former I      shall dwell for ever. Do thou, if it please thee, hold in dishonour      what is honoured by Heaven.\"    Here is the source of the tragedy, the will of the individual in  conflict with established authority.    A chorus of Theban elders enters, singing an ode of deliverance and  joy; they have been summoned by Creon, the new King, uncle of Oedipus'  children. Full of the sense of his own importance Creon states the  official view. Polyneices is to remain unburied.        \"Any man who considers private friendship to be more important than      the State is a man of naught. In the name of all-seeing Zeus I would      not hold my tongue if I saw ruin coming to the citizens instead of      safety, nor would I make a friend of my country's enemy. Sure am I      that it is the State that saves us; she is the ship that carries us;      we make our friendships without overturning her.\"    The elders promise obedience, but grave news is reported by a guard who  has been set to watch the corpse. Someone had scattered dust lightly  over the dead and departed without leaving any trace; neither he nor his  companions had done the deed.    When the Chorus suggest that it is the work of some deity, Creon answers  in great impatience:        \"Cease, lest thou be proved a fool as well as old. Thy words are      intolerable when thou sayest that the gods can have a care of this      corpse. What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?      Did he not come to burn their pillared temples and offerings and      precincts and shatter our laws?\"    He angrily thrusts the watchman forth, threatening to hang him and his  companions alive unless they find the culprit.        \"There are many marvels, but none greater than Man. He crosses the      wintry sea, he wears away the hard earth with his plough, ensnareth      the light-hearted race of birds, catcheth the wild beasts, trappeth      the things of the deep, yoketh the horse and the unwearying ox. He      hath taught himself speech and thought swift as the wind, hath learnt      the moods of a city life and can avoid the shafts of the frost; he      hath a device for every problem save Death--though disease he can      escape. Sometimes he moveth to ill, again to good; his cities rear      their heads when they reverence the laws and the gods; he wrecketh      his city when he boldly forsakes the good. May an evil-doer never      share my hearth or heart.\"    Such is the ordinary man's view of the action of Polyneices, for in  Sophocles the Chorus certainly represents average public opinion. It  is quickly challenged by the entry of Antigone with the Watchman, whose  story Creon hastens out to hear. With no little self-satisfaction the  Watchman tells how they caught the girl in the very act of replacing  the dust they had removed and pouring libations over the dead. Antigone  admits the deed. When asked how she dare defy the official ordinance,  she replies--        \"It came neither from Zeus nor from Justice, nor did I deem that thy      decrees had such power that a mortal could override the unwritten      and unshaken laws of Heaven. These have not their life from now or      yesterday, but from everlasting, and no man knows whence they have      appeared. It was not likely that, through fear of any man's will,      I would pay Heaven's penalty for their infringement. Die I must, even      hadst thou made no proclamation; if I die before my time, I count      it all gain. If my act seem folly to thee, maybe it is a foolish      judge who counts me mad.\"    Creon replies that this is sheer insolence; it is an insult that he, a  man, should give way to a woman. He threatens to destroy both girls, but  Antigone is sure that public opinion is with her, though for the moment  it is muzzled through fear. Ismene is brought in and offers to die with  her sister; Antigone refuses her offer, insisting that she alone has  deserved chastisement.    In a second ode the gradual extinction of Oedipus' race is described,  owing to foolish word and insensate thought, for \"when Heaven leads a  man to ruin it makes him believe that evil is good\". A new interest is  added by Creon's son Haemon, the affianced lover of Antigone, who comes  to interview his father. This is the first instance in European drama of  that without which much modern literature would have little reason for  existing at all--the love element, wisely kept in check by the Greeks. A  further conflict of wills adds to the dramatic effect of the play; Creon  insists on filial obedience, for he cannot claim to rule a city if  he fails to control his own family. Haemon answers with courtesy and  deference; he points out that the force of public opinion is behind  Antigone and suggests that the official view may perhaps be wrong  because it is the expression of an individual's judgment. When he is  himself charged thus directly with the very fault for which he claimed  to punish Antigone, Creon lets his temper get the mastery; after a  violent quarrel Haemon parts from him with a dark threat that the girl's  death will remove more than one person, and vows never to cross his  father's doorstep again.    Antigone is soon carried away to her doom; she is to be shut up in a  cavern without food. In a dialogue of great beauty she confesses her  human weakness--death is near, and with it banishment from the joys of  life. Creon bids her make an end; her last speech concludes with a clear  statement of the problem. Who knows if she is right? She herself will  know after death. If she has erred, she will confess it; if the King is  wrong, she prays he may not suffer greater woes than her own.    A reaction now occurs. Teiresias, the blind seer, seeks out Creon  because of the failure of his sacrificial rites; the birds of the air  are gorged with human blood, and fail to give the signs of augury. He  bids Creon return to his right senses and quit his stubbornness. When  the latter mockingly accuses the seer of being bribed, he learns the  dread punishment his obstinacy has brought him.        \"Know that thou shalt not see out many hurrying rounds of the sun      before thou shalt give one sprung from thine own loins in exchange      for the dead, one in return for two, for thou hast thrust below      one of the children of the light, penning up her spirit in a tomb      with dishonour, and thou keepest above ground a body that belongs      to the gods below, without its share of funerals, unrighteously;      wherefore the late-punishing ruinous gods of death and the      Furies lie in wait for thee, to catch thee in like agonies.\"    Cowed by the terror, the King hurries to undo his work, calling for  pickaxes to open the tomb and himself going with all speed to set free  its victim.    The sequel is told by a messenger who at the outset strikes a note of  woe.        \"Creon I once envied, for he was the saviour of his land, and was      the father of noble children. Now all is lost. When men lose      pleasure, I deem that they are not alive but moving corpses. Heap      up wealth and live in kingly state, but if there is no pleasure      withal, I would not pay the worth of a shadow for all the rest.      Haemon is dead.\"    Hearing the news, Eurydice the Queen comes out, and bids him tell his  story in full. Creon found Haemon clasping the body of Antigone who had  hung herself. Seeing his father, he made a murderous attack on him;  when it failed, he drew his sword and fell on it--thus in death the  two lovers were not separated. In an ominous silence the Queen departs.  Creon enters with his son's body, to be utterly shattered by a second  and"]]]
