But  one would wish that the educators of the rising generation of women  should, basing themselves upon these foundations, point out to every  girl how great is woman's debt to civilisation; in other words, how  much is under civilisation done for woman by man.    And one would wish that, in a world which is rendered unwholesome by  feminism, every girl's eyes were opened to comprehend the great  outstanding fact of the world: the fact that, turn where you will, you  find individual man showering upon individual woman--one man in  tribute to her enchantment, another out of a sense of gratitude, and  another just because she is something that is his--every good thing  which, suffrage or no suffrage, she never could have procured for  herself.      APPENDIX    LETTER ON MILITANT HYSTERIA    Reprinted by permission from _The Times_  (London), March 28, 1912.    TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES    SIR,--For man the physiological psychology of woman is full of  difficulties.    He is not a little mystified when he encounters in her periodically  recurring phases of hypersensitiveness, unreasonableness, and loss of  the sense of proportion.    He is frankly perplexed when confronted with a complete alteration of  character in a woman who is child-bearing.    When he is a witness of the \"tendency of woman to morally warp when  nervously ill,\" and of the terrible physical havoc which the pangs of  a disappointed love may work, he is appalled.    And it leaves on his mind an eerie feeling when he sees serious and  long-continued mental disorders developing in connexion with the  approaching extinction of a woman's reproductive faculty.    No man can close his eyes to these things; but he does not feel at  liberty to speak of them.    \"For the woman that God gave him is not his to give away.\"[1]    [1 From \"The Female of the Species\" by Rudyard Kipling]    As for woman herself, she makes very light of any of these mental  upsettings.    She perhaps smiles a little at them. . . .[1]    [1] In the interests of those who feel that female dignity is  compromised by it, I have here omitted a woman's flippant overestimate  of the number of women in London society who suffer from nervous  disorders at the climacteric [i.e. menopause].    None the less, these upsettings of her mental equilibrium are the  things that a woman has most cause to fear; and no doctor can ever  lose sight of the fact that the mind of woman is always threatened  with danger from the reverberations of her physiological emergencies.    It is with such thoughts that the doctor lets his eyes rest upon the  militant suffragist. He cannot shut them to the fact that there is  mixed up with the woman's movement much mental disorder; and he cannot  conceal from himself the physiological emergencies which lie behind.    The recruiting field for the militant suffragists is the million of  our excess female population--that million which had better long ago  have gone out to mate with its complement of men beyond the sea.    Among them there are the following different types of women:--    (_a_)  First--let us put them first--come a class of women who hold,  with minds otherwise unwarped, that they may, whenever it is to their  advantage, lawfully resort to physical violence.    The programme, as distinguished from the methods, of these women is  not very different from that of the ordinary suffragist woman.    (_b_)  There file past next a class of women who have all their  life-long been strangers to joy, women in whom instincts long  suppressed have in the end broken into flame. These are the sexually  embittered women in whom everything has turned into gall and  bitterness of heart, and hatred of men.    Their legislative programme is license for themselves, or else  restrictions for man.    (_c_)  Next there file past the incomplete. One side of their nature  has undergone atrophy, with the result that they have lost touch with  their living fellow men and women.    Their programme is to convert the whole world into an epicene  institution---an epicene institution in which man and woman shall  everywhere work side by side at the selfsame tasks and for the  selfsame pay.    These wishes can never by any possibility be realised.  Even in  animals--I say _even,_ because in these at least one of the sexes has  periods of complete quiscence--male and female cannot be safely worked  side by side, except when they are incomplete.    While in the human species safety can be obtained, it can be obtained  only at the price of continual constraint.    And even then woman, though she protests that she does not require it,  and that she does not receive it, practically always does receive  differential treatment at the hands of man.    It would be well, I often think, that every woman should be clearly  told--and the woman of the world will immediately understand--that  when man sets his face against the proposal to bring in an epicene  world, he does so because he can do his best work only in surroundings  where he is perfectly free from suggestion and from restraint, and  from the onus which all differential treatment imposes.    And I may add in connexion with my own profession that when a medical  man asks that he should not be the yoke-fellow of a medical woman he  does so also because he would wish to keep up as between men and  women--even when they are doctors--some of the modesties and  reticences upon which our civilisation has been built up.    Now the medical woman is of course never on the side of modesty,[1] or  in favour of any reticences. Her desire for knowledge does not allow  of these.    [1] To those who have out of inadvertence and as laymen and women  misunderstood, it may be explained that the issue here discussed is  the second in order of the three which are set out on p. 139 (_supra_).    (_d_)  Inextricably mixed up with the types which we have been  discussing is the type of woman whom Dr. Leonard Williams's recent  letter brought so distinctly before our eyes--the woman who is  poisoned by her misplaced self-esteem; and who flies out at every man  who does not pay homage to her intellect.    She is the woman who is affronted when a man avers that _for him_ the  glory of woman lies in her power of attraction, in her capacity for  motherhood, and in unswerving allegiance to the ethics which are  special to her sex.    I have heard such an intellectually embittered woman say, though she  had been self-denyingly taken to wife, that \"never in the whole course  of her life had a man ever as much as done her a kindness.\"    The programme of this type of woman is, as a preliminary, to compel  man to admit her claim to be his intellectual equal; and, that done,  to compel him to divide up everything with her to the last farthing,  and so make her also his financial equal.    And her journals exhibit to us the kind of parliamentary  representative she desiderates. He humbly, hat in hand, asks for his  orders from a knot of washerwomen standing arms a-kimbo.[2]    [2] I give, in response to a request, the reference: _Votes for Women,_  March 18, 1910, p. 381.    (_e_)  Following in the wake of these embittered human beings come  troops of girls just grown up.    All these will assure you, these young girls--and what is seething in  their minds is stirring also in the minds in the girls in the colleges  and schools which are staffed by unmarried suffragists--that woman has  suffered all manner of indignity and injustice at the hands of man.        And these young girls have been told about the intellectual, and  moral, and financial value of woman--such tales as it never entered  into the heart of man to conceive.    The programme of these young women is to be married upon their own  terms. Man shall--so runs their scheme--work for their support--to  that end giving up his freedom, and putting himself under orders, for  many hours of the day; but they themselves must not be asked to give  up any of their liberty to him, or to subordinate themselves to his  interests, or to obey him in anything.    To obey a man would be to commit the unpardonable sin.    It is not necessary, in connexion with a movement which proceeds on  the lines set out above, any further to labour the point that there is  in it an element of mental disorder. It is plain that it is there.    There is also a quite fatuous element in the programmes of the  militant suffragist. We have this element, for instance, in the  doctrine that, notwithstanding the fact that the conditions of the  labour market deny it to her, woman ought to receive the same wage as  a man for the same work.    This doctrine is fatuous, because it leaves out of sight that, even if  woman succeeds in doing the same work as man, he has behind him a much  larger reserve of physical strength. As soon as a time of strain  comes, areserve of strength and freedom from periodic indisposition is  worth paying extra for.    Fatuous also is the dogma that woman ought to have the same pay for  the same work--fatuous because it leaves out of sight that woman's  commercial value in many of the best fields of work is subject to a  very heavy discount by reason of the fact that she cannot, like a male  employee, work cheek by jowl with a male employer; nor work among men  as a man with his fellow employees.    So much for the woman suffragist's protest that she can conceive of no  reason for a differential rate of pay for man.    Quite as fatuous are the marriage projects of the militant suffragist.  Every woman of the world could tell her--whispering it into her  private ear--that if a sufficient number of men should come to the  conclusion that it was not worth their while to marry except on the  terms of fair give-and-take, the suffragist woman's demands would have  to come down.    It is not at all certain that the institution of matrimony--which,  after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#15)"],[1,"Washington. In the meantime, why don't you  follow up that Roscommon angle? That's the best lead I've struck.\"    Harcourt finished his Bourbon. \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he observed, \"you're  quite right but there isn't a single thing I can do about it. We've had  top-level orders to lay off that guy and with the Bureau, orders is  orders.\"          CHAPTER 11      When I entered my office on Monday morning, the genteel receptionist  informed me with some austerity that Mr. Roscommon was waiting for me.    \"Okay, send him in,\" I directed, bracing myself for what would probably  be a stormy interview. If Roscommon was as well-informed as he claimed  to be, he must know that I had already reported him to the F.B.I.    \"Smart work, Tompkins!\" he beamed, giving my hand a vise-like squeeze.  \"Working as I do with the highest echelons, I'm afraid I sometimes  forget the value of naiveté. You couldn't have invented anything better  calculated to slow down the Bureau than to report me as a Nazi agent.  Even the Director was impressed, though he'll see through your ruse  after a couple of days.\"    \"Is that what you wanted to tell me?\" I inquired, \"because your visit  will certainly arouse new suspicions. I assume I'm still under F.B.I.  observation.\"    Axel Roscommon smiled. \"Nothing to worry about, old boy, I assure  you. Naturally you'll have to go to Washington sooner or later and  explain things there. I suggest that you go next week, when the whole  Administration will be in a state of maximum confusion.\"    I asked him whether that would be any change.    \"Absolutely, old boy. The war's been managed quite impressively well up  to now. After this week, with Roosevelt out of the way, things will  begin to fall apart and there will be plenty of pickings but the war is  already won, so that won't hurt.\"    Roosevelt, I observed, was down in Georgia, according to the papers,  but that didn't mean he couldn't keep in touch with things in  Washington.    Roscommon stood close against my desk and leaned forward on his hands,  facing me. \"Listen carefully, old boy,\" he said, \"and keep this to  yourself. Roosevelt will be dead before the week's out--on Friday the  thirteenth if there's any symmetry to be expected in this crazy world.  It's the same stuff they gave Woodrow Wilson over at Paris in the  spring of 1919. You may remember that chap Yardley wrote a book, 'The  American Black Chamber,' and told how the American Intelligence got  word of a plot to poison Wilson by one of America's allies. Not long  after, Wilson had a slight illness and a few months later had a stroke,  as they called it. You see your American Constitution--marvelous  document, that!--makes absolutely no bloody provision for the illness  of a President, and Wilson's paralysis paralyzed your government  for nearly two years, while America's allies cleaned up on the  peace-arrangements.    \"Roosevelt is tougher than Wilson was. They slipped him the first dose  at Teheran early last year. When he came back that spring he had a  slight illness--they called it influenza--and he was never quite the  same. Except for a few trusted social associates, close friends and  members of the family, he was kept in strict seclusion. Then, with  his amazing vitality, he began to throw off the stuff and staged a  magnificent political campaign last fall. So they had to try again at  Yalta early this year. The second time they gave him too much. He had  one bad attack on the cruiser coming back from the Mediterranean. When  he addressed Congress, he had the same gaunt look and thick speech  that Wilson had towards the end. The final stroke is due this week and  has been held off only because he's taking things easy. No, old chap,  Roosevelt's doomed and all I can tell you is that the Germans had no  part in it. Only five men in America know about this, and F.D.R. is one  of them.\"    \"You're talking utter piffle,\" I replied. \"I can see how Hitler or Tojo  might want to get rid of Roosevelt but who else? Why don't you warn the  authorities. Or I could.\"    Roscommon smiled rather sadly. \"What good would it do? There's no  antidote after the first twenty-four hours. If Roosevelt hasn't warned  them, why should you? All that would happen would be to put yourself  under the blackest kind of suspicion. Just fancy the reaction of the  American Intelligence. You march in and say, 'See here, the President's  been poisoned and will die before the end of the week.' They promptly  call for an ambulance and an alienist and send you to St. Elizabeth's  for observation. Then the President does die. 'By the Lord Harry!' they  think, 'this chap we locked up said Roosevelt would die and now he has  died. He probably had a hand in it himself. Let's fix him just to be  safe!'\"    I nodded. \"Yes, I can see that,\" I agreed. \"Look at what happened when  Lincoln was assassinated. But if I'm not to pass word on to anybody,  what's the point of telling me about it--assuming it to be true, which  I doubt?\"    \"Naturally you doubt me, my boy, naturally. All you need do is to wait  until Friday the thirteenth and if I'm right you'll know it and if I'm  wrong you'll know it. But I assure you that I am not wrong. The war is  over and Roosevelt is the only obstacle to certain long-range practical  arrangements for organizing the peace. The Old World, mind you, doesn't  like outsiders like Wilson and Roosevelt telling them what to do with  victory. From now on, America is going to be immobilized. It's all  rather simple, really, but I haven't time to explain how simple it is  because the explanation is bloody complicated.\"    \"You still haven't told me why you have passed on this fantastic story  to me,\" I pointed out.    \"Oh, that? It's just this, my boy. Sell the war short! Sell it  short! You must use all the funds that Ribbentrop gave you to get  a real nest-egg. With Germany defeated, our intelligence will need  funds--decentralized funds--and this is your chance to do an important  job. I don't care what the Foreign Minister told you to do with the  money. Forget him--he's a dead duck, anyway. Just take the cash and  sell the war short. Make a killing and then we'll be able to finance  future operations.\"    After Roscommon had made another of his abrupt departures, I buzzed for  Arthurjean and told her to ask my partners to come in.    Wasson was the same as he had been before--plump, dark-haired and  energetic. Philip Cone was taller, fair-haired, blue-eyed, with a quiet  manner and a sleepy expression.    \"Morning, Graham. Morning, Phil,\" I greeted them. \"The other day,  Graham, you got peeved because I wanted to go slow on the Fynch  portfolio. I only had a hunch then but I knew we'd better not rush into  one of our regular reinvestment run-arounds. Now I've made a check and  I see the new line. Boys, from now on, we've got to sell the war short.\"    \"What do you mean 'sell the war short?'\" Wasson demanded. \"The Japs are  good for another year and those Nazis are fighting pretty damn well,  too. You don't mean to go America First, separate peace or any of that  rot, do you?\"    \"You know me better than that,\" I reproved him. \"No. My tip is that the  Germans will surrender within a month and the Japs before Labor Day.  What do we do to clean up?\"    \"Je-sus!\" Cone drawled appreciatively. \"The bottom will drop out of the  market!\"    \"No, Phil it won't,\" Wasson objected. \"They won't let it. That would be  an admission that Wall Street is cashing in on the war.\"    \"Well, aren't we cashing in?\" asked Cone, \"I haven't heard a single  broker or banker committing suicide since Pearl Harbor.\"    \"Nuts to that talk!\" Wasson replied. \"No, Winnie, my point is that Wall  Street can't afford a peace-scare selling wave, and if stocks start to  drop the big boys will move in and support the market.\"    \"How about commodities, Graham?\" I asked. \"You know that end of the  business. The whole world will be hungry and naked. Can't we move in  there without risk?\"    Wesson laughed bitterly. \"There will be only about eighteen governments  and government boards riding herd on you every time you move in with  real money in that racket. Anyhow, they tell me that this guy Roosevelt  has ordered the F.B.I. to move in on the Black Market.\"    \"Well, boys,\" I observed, \"the way you put it we can't do a damn thing  to make money out of the same kind of tip-off that set the House of  Rothschild up for a hundred years after the Battle of Waterloo. That  doesn't make sense.\"    Phil Cone smiled sheepishly. \"Oh, I wouldn't say that, Winnie. We can  cash in but we'll have to step out of our field. We could shift a  million dollars to Canada. You can get a Canadian dollar for ninety  cents American. A year from now it will be back to par. That's better  than ten percent on your money in less than a year.\"    \"What about South America?\" I asked.    \"Lay off the Latins, Winnie,\" Wasson advised me. \"Brazil's the only  country in South America that's good for the long pull and just now is  no time to monkey with Brazil. They've got some politics just now.\"    I considered things a bit. \"Let's see if we can figure out a way to  make a quick killing,\" I said. \"Suppose, for example, something drastic  happened--like Roosevelt dying on one of his plane-trips--to mark the  end of some of these controls. What would happen to the market?\"    Wasson chuckled. \"If that guy popped off, there'd be dancing in Wall  Street and you'd have to shut down the Exchange because the ticker  couldn't keep up with the buying orders. Prices would go higher than  the Empire State Building. Hell! They'd hit the stratosphere.\"    \"Is that your opinion, Phil?\" I asked.    Cone shook his head. \"Only a few suckers would feel like that, Winnie,\"  he told me. \"The big-time operators would be shivering in their boots.  As long as F.D.R. is in the White House there's no limit to what they  can make out of the war. If Roosevelt died now, you'd see the bottom"]]]
