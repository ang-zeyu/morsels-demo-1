Then, looking with the Great Spy-Glass, I saw that there moved across  the Land, from the direction of the Plain of Blue Fire, a mighty Hump,  seeming of Black Mist, and came with prodigious swiftness. And I called  to the Master Monstruwacan, that he come and look through one of the  eye-pieces that were about the Great Spy-Glass; and he came quickly, and  when he had looked a while, he called to the Monstruwacan that had made  report. And the Monstruwacan answered, and replied that the Influence  drew nearer, by the reading of the instrument; yet of the thing itself  the man had no sight.    And I ceased not to look, and in a little while, the Humped thing passed  downwards into the Vale of Red Fire, which lay across the Land that way.  But I watched steadfastly, and presently I saw the black Hump climb up  from the Vale of Red Fire upon this side, and come through the night, so  that in scarce a minute it had come halfway across that part of the  Night Land.    And my heart stood quiet with fear, and the utter terror of this  Monster, which I knew to be surely one of the Great Forces of Evil of  that Land, and had power, without doubt, to destroy the spirit. And the  Master Monstruwacan leapt towards the Home-Call, and sent the great  Sound down to the Ten-thousand, that they might attend, and immediately,  he signalled to them to Beware. Yet, already I perceived that they knew  of this Utter Danger that was upon them; for I saw them slay the Youths  quickly, that their spirits might not be lost; for they were Unprepared.  But the men, being Prepared, had the Capsule, and would die swiftly in  the last moment.    I looked again towards the Hump, and saw that it came like a Hill of  Blackness in the Land, and was almost anigh. Then there happened a  wonder; for in that moment when all had else gone quickly, that they  might save their souls, out of the earth there rose a little Light, like  to the crescent of the young moon of this early day. And the crescent  rose up into an arch of bright and cold fire, glowing but little; and it  spanned above the Ten-thousand and the dead; and the Hump stood still,  and went backwards and was presently lost.    And the men came swiftly towards the Mighty Pyramid. Yet, ere they were  come to safety, the Baying of the Hounds sounded close upon them, and  they faced to the danger; yet, as I could know, without despair, because  that they yet lived after so enormous a peril.    And the Hounds were very nigh, as now I beheld with the Great Spy-Glass;  and I counted five score, running with mighty heads low, and in a pack.  And lo! as the Hounds came at them, the Ten-thousand drew apart, and had  a space between the men, that they might have full use of that terrible  Diskos; and they fought with the handles at length, and I saw the disks  spin and glisten and send out fire.    Then was there a very great battle; for the Light that arched above  them, and held away The Power from their souls, made not to protect them  from this danger of the lesser monsters. And at an hundred thousand  embrasures within the Mighty Pyramid, the women cried and sobbed, and  looked again. And in the lower cities it was told, after, that the  Peoples could hear the crash and splinter of the armour, as the Hounds  ran to and fro, slaying; aye, even the sound of the armour between their  teeth.    Yet, the Ten-thousand ceased not to smite with the Diskos; and they  hewed the Hounds in pieces; but of the men that went forth, there were a  thousand and seven hundred slain by the Hounds, ere the men won to  victory.    Then came that wearied band of heroes back to the home shelter of the  Vast Redoubt; and they bore their dead with them, and the Youths that  they slew. And they were received with great honour, and with exceeding  grief, and in a great silence; for the thing admitted not of words,  until a time had passed. And in the cities of the Pyramid there was  mourning; for there had been no sorrow like unto this through, mayhap,  an hundred thousand years.    And they bore the Youths to their Mothers and to their Fathers; and the  Father of each made thanks to the men that they had saved the soul of  his son; but the women were silent. Yet, neither to the Father nor to  the Mother, was ever made known the name of the slayers; for this might  not be; as all shall see with a little thought.    And some did remember that, in verity, all was due to the unwisdom of  those Youths, who had heeded not the Law and their life-teachings. Yet  had they paid to the uttermost, and passed outwards; and the account of  their Deeds was closed.    And all this while did great numbers spy toward the Road Where The  Silent Ones Walk, that they might watch that band of Youths afar in the  Night Land, who went forward amid those horrid dangers. Yet, when the  dead Youths had been brought in, many had ceased to look out for a time  and had turned to questioning, and some had made inspection that they  might know which had come back, and which lay out there where the Giants  had slain them, or went forward to more dreadful matters.    But who of those that were abroad, were slain, or still went onward, we  had but indifferent knowledge; though the men of the Ten-thousand knew  somewhat, having had speech with the wounded Youths, ere they slew them.  And, as may be thought, these men were sorely questioned by the Mothers  and the Fathers of those Youths that were not accounted of; yet I doubt  that few had much knowledge wherewith to console them.    Now there was presently, in the Garden of Silence, which was the  lowermost of all the Underground Fields, the Ending of those seventeen  hundred heroes, and of the Youths that they saved and slew. And the  Garden was a great country, and an hundred miles every way, and the roof  thereof was three great miles above, and shaped to a mighty dome; as it  had been that the Builders and Makers thereof did remember in their  spirits the visible sky of this our present age.    And the making of that Country was all set out in a single History of  seven thousand and seventy Volumes. And there were likewise seven  thousand and seventy years spent to the making of that Country; so that  there had unremembered generations lived and laboured and died, and seen  not the end of their labour. And Love had shaped it and hallowed it; so  that of all the wonders of the world, there has been none that shall  ever come anigh to that Country of Silence--an hundred miles every way  of Silence to the Dead.    And there were in that roof seven moons set in a mighty circle, and lit  by the Earth-Current; and the circle was sixty miles across, so that all  that Country of Quiet was visible; yet to no great glare, but a sweet  and holy light; so that I did always feel in my heart that a man might  weep there, and be unashamed.    And in the midst of that silent Country, there was a great hill, and  upon the hill a vast Dome. And the Dome was full of a Light that might  be seen in all that Country, which was the Garden of Silence. And  beneath the Dome was the \"Crack,\" and within it the glory of the  Earth-Current, from which all had life and light and safety. And in the  Dome, at the North, there was a gateway; and a narrow road went upward  to the gateway; and the Road was named The Last Road; and the Gateway  was named by no name, but known to all as The Gateway.    And there were in that mighty Country, long roadways, and hidden methods  to help travel; and constant temples of rest along the miles; and  groves; and the charm of water, falling. And everywhere the Statues of  Memory, and the Tablets of Memory; and the whole of that Great  Underground Country full of an echo of Eternity and of Memory and Love  and Greatness; so that to walk alone in that Land was to grow back to  the wonder and mystery of Childhood; and presently to go upwards again  to the Cities of the Mighty Pyramid, purified and sweetened of soul and  mind.    And in my boyhood, I have wandered oft a week of days in that Country of  Silence, and had my food with me, and slept quietly amid the memories;  and gone on again, wrapped about with the quiet of the Everlasting. And  the man-soul within would be drawn mightily to those places where the  Great Ones of the past Eternity of the World had their Memory named; but  there was that within me which ever drew me, in the ending, to the Hills  of the Babes; those little hills where might be heard amid the  lonesomeness of an utter quiet, a strange and wondrous echo, as of a  little child calling over the hills. But how this was I know not, save  by the sweet cunning of some dead Maker in the forgotten years.    And here, mayhaps by reason of this Voice of Pathos, were to be found  the countless Tokens of Memory to all the babes of the Mighty Pyramid,  through a thousand ages. And, odd whiles, would I come upon some  Mother, sitting there lonely, or mayhaps companied by others. And by  this little telling shall you know somewhat of the quietness and the  wonder and the holiness of that great Country hallowed to all Memory and  to Eternity and to our Dead.    And it was here, into the Country of Silence, that they brought down the  Dead to their Burial. And there came down into the Country of Silence,  maybe an Hundred Million, out of the Cities of the Pyramid, to be  present, and to do Honour.    Now they that had charge of the Dead, did lay them upon the road which  ran up unto The Gateway, even that same road which was named The Last  Road. And the Road moved upwards slowly with the Dead; and the Dead went  inward through The Gateway; first the poor Youths, and afterward they  that had given up life that they might save them.    And as the Dead went upwards, there was a very great Silence over all  the miles of the Country of Silence. But in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden. Part II. (#16)"],[1,"respect than the Poets; the  cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite subject with  the antient artists: and the tortures of expiring martyrs have disgraced  the modern ones. It requires little genius to exhibit the muscles in  convulsive action either by the pencil or the chissel, because the  interstices are deep, and the lines strongly defined: but those tender  gradations of muscular action, which constitute the graceful attitudes of  the body, are difficult to conceive or to execute, except by a master of  nice discernment and cultivated taste. _B._ By what definition would you  distinguish the Horrid from the Tragic?    _P._ I suppose the latter consists of Distress attended with Pity, which  is said to be allied to Love, the most agreeable of all our passions;  and the former in Distress, accompanied with Disgust, which is allied to  Hate, and is one of our most disagreeable sensations. Hence, when horrid  scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures, we wish to disbelieve  their existence, and voluntarily exert ourselves to escape from the  deception: whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy is mingled with some  sweet consolatory drops, which endear our tears, and we continue to  contemplate the interesting delusion with a delight which it is not easy  to explain.    _B._ Has not this been explained by Lucretius, where he describes a  shipwreck; and says, the Spectators receive pleasure from feeling  themselves safe on land? and by Akenside, in his beautiful poem on the  Pleasures of Imagination, who ascribes it to our finding objects for the  due exertion of our passions?    _P_. We must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of real  misery with those which we experience at the scenical representations of  tragedy. The spectators of a shipwreck may be attracted by the dignity  and novelty of the object; and from these may be said to receive  pleasure; but not from the distress of the sufferers. An ingenious  writer, who has criticised this dialogue in the English Review for  August, 1789, adds, that one great source of our pleasure from scenical  distress arises from our, at the same time, generally contemplating one  of the noblest objects of nature, that of Virtue triumphant over  every difficulty and oppression, or supporting its votary under every  suffering: or, where this does not occur, that our minds are relieved  by the justice of some signal punishment awaiting the delinquent. But,  besides this, at the exhibition of a good tragedy, we are not only amused  by the dignity, and novelty, and beauty, of the objects before us; but,  if any distressful circumstances occur too forcible for our sensibility,  we can voluntarily exert ourselves, and recollect, that the scenery is  not real: and thus not only the pain, which we had received from the  apparent distress, is lessened, but a new source of pleasure is opened  to us, similar to that which we frequently have felt on awaking from a  distressful dream; we are glad that it is not true. We are at the same  time unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other  interesting circumstances of the drama; and on that account quickly  permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion; and thus alternately  believe and disbelieve, almost every moment, the existence of the objects  represented before us.    _B_. Have those two sovereigns of poetic land, HOMER and SHAKESPEAR, kept  their works entirely free from the Horrid?--or even yourself in your  third Canto?    _P_. The descriptions of the mangled carcasses of the companions of  Ulysses, in the cave of Polypheme, is in this respect certainly  objectionable, as is well observed by Scaliger. And in the play of Titus  Andronicus, if that was written by Shakespear (which from its internal  evidence I think very improbable), there are many horrid and disgustful  circumstances. The following Canto is submitted to the candour of the  critical reader, to whose opinion I shall submit in silence.                THE            LOVES            OF THE            PLANTS.                CANTO III.            And now the Goddess founds her silver shell,          And shakes with deeper tones the inchanted dell;          Pale, round her grassy throne, bedew'd with tears,          Flit the thin forms of Sorrows, and of Fears;  5      Soft Sighs responsive whisper to the chords,          And Indignations half-unsheath their swords.          \"Thrice round the grave CIRCAEA prints her tread,          And chaunts the numbers, which disturb the dead;          Shakes o'er the holy earth her sable plume,  10    Waves her dread wand, and strikes the echoing tomb!          --Pale shoot the stars across the troubled night,          The timorous moon withholds her conscious light;          Shrill scream the famish'd bats, and shivering owls,          And loud and long the dog of midnight howls!--      [_Circaea_. l. 7. Enchanter's Nightshade. Two males, one female. It was  much celebrated in the mysteries of witchcraft, and for the purpose of  raising the devil, as its name imports. It grows amid the mouldering  bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous vaults of Sleaford-church in  Lincolnshire. The superstitious ceremonies or histories belonging to some  vegetables have been truly ridiculous; thus the Druids are said to have  cropped the Misletoe with a golden axe or sickle; and the Bryony, or  Mandrake, was said to utter a scream when its root was drawn from the  ground; and that the animal which drew it up became diseased and soon  died: on which account, when it was wanted for the purposes of medicine,  it was usual to loosen and remove the earth about the root, and then to  tie it by means of a cord to a dog's tail, who was whipped to pull it up,  and was then supposed to suffer for the impiety of the action. And even  at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed smooth, and strung,  and sold under the name of Anodyne necklaces, and tied round the necks of  children, to facilitate the growth of their teeth! add to this, that in  Price's History of Cornwall, a book published about ten years ago, the  Virga Divinatoria, or Divining Rod, has a degree of credit given to it.  This rod is of hazle, or other light wood, and held horizontally in the  hand, and is said to bow towards the ore whenever the Conjurer walks over  a mine. A very few years ago, in France, and even in England, another  kind of divining rod has been used to discover springs of water in a  similar manner, and gained some credit. And in the very last year, there  were many in France, and some in England, who underwent an enchantment  without any divining rod at all, and believed themselves to be affected  by an invisible agent, which the Enchanter called Animal Magnetism!]              --Then yawns the bursting ground!--_two_ imps obscene          Rise on broad wings, and hail the baleful queen;          Each with dire grin salutes the potent wand,          And leads the sorceress with his sooty hand;          Onward they glide, where sheds the sickly yew  20    O'er many a mouldering bone its nightly dew;          The ponderous portals of the church unbar,--          Hoarse on their hinge the ponderous portals jar;          As through the colour'd glass the moon-beam falls,          Huge shapeless spectres quiver on the walls;  25    Low murmurs creep along the hollow ground,          And to each step the pealing ailes resound;          By glimmering lamps, protecting saints among,          The shrines all tremble as they pass along,          O'er the still choir with hideous laugh they move,  30    (Fiends yell below, and angels weep above!)

The intoxication or  inspiration is finely described by Virgil. AEn. L. vi. The distilled  water from laurel-leaves is, perhaps, the most sudden poison we are  acquainted with in this country. I have seen about two spoonfuls of it  destroy a large pointer dog in less than ten minutes. In a smaller dose  it is said to produce intoxication: on this account there is reason to  believe it acts in the same manner as opium and vinous spirit; but that  the dose is not so well ascertained. See note on Tremella. It is used  in the Ratafie of the distillers, by which some dram-drinkers have been  suddenly killed. One pint of water, distilled from fourteen pounds of  black cherry stones bruised, has the same deleterious effect,  destroying as suddenly as laurel-water. It is probable Apricot-kernels,  Peach-leaves, Walnut-leaves, and whatever possesses the kernel-flavour,  may have similar qualities.]              Contending hosts and trembling nations wait          The firm immutable behests of Fate;          --She speaks in thunder from her golden throne  50    With words _unwill'd_, and wisdom not her own.
