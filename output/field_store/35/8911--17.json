I forbid you to get lost again.\"    \"Of course,\" he answered. \"It won't be my fault if I get lost again;  but it wasn't my fault this time.\"          Chapter Sixteen    The Enchanted Fishes      I must now tell you what happened to Ervic and the three other Skeezers  who were left floating in the iron boat after Queen Coo-ee-oh had been  transformed into a Diamond Swan by the magic of the Flathead Su-dic.    The four Skeezers were all young men and their leader was Ervic.  Coo-ee-oh had taken them with her in the boat to assist her if she  captured the Flathead chief, as she hoped to do by means of her silver  rope. They knew nothing about the witchcraft that moved the submarine  and so, when left floating upon the lake, were at a loss what to do.  The submarine could not be submerged by them or made to return to the  sunken island. There were neither oars nor sails in the boat, which was  not anchored but drifted quietly upon the surface of the lake.    The Diamond Swan had no further thought or care for her people. She had  sailed over to the other side of the lake and all the calls and  pleadings of Ervic and his companions were unheeded by the vain bird.  As there was nothing else for them to do, they sat quietly in their  boat and waited as patiently as they could for someone to come to their  aid.    The Flatheads had refused to help them and had gone back to their  mountain. All the Skeezers were imprisoned in the Great Dome and could  not help even themselves. When evening came, they saw the Diamond Swan,  still keeping to the opposite shore of the lake, walk out of the water  to the sands, shake her diamond-sprinkled feathers, and then disappear  among the bushes to seek a resting place for the night.    \"I'm hungry,\" said Ervic.    \"I'm cold,\" said another Skeezer.    \"I'm tired,\" said a third.    \"I'm afraid,\" said the last one of them.    But it did them no good to complain. Night fell and the moon rose and  cast a silvery sheen over the surface of the water.    \"Go to sleep,\" said Ervic to his companions. \"I'll stay awake and  watch, for we may be rescued in some unexpected way.\"    So the other three laid themselves down in the bottom of the boat and  were soon fast asleep.    Ervic watched. He rested himself by leaning over the bow of the boat,  his face near to the moonlit water, and thought dreamily of the day's  surprising events and wondered what would happen to the prisoners in  the Great Dome.    Suddenly a tiny goldfish popped its head above the surface of the lake,  not more than a foot from his eyes. A silverfish then raised its head  beside that of the goldfish, and a moment later a bronzefish lifted its  head beside the others. The three fish, all in a row, looked earnestly  with their round, bright eyes into the astonished eyes of Ervic the  Skeezer.    \"We are the three Adepts whom Queen Coo-ee-oh betrayed and wickedly  transformed,\" said the goldfish, its voice low and soft but distinctly  heard in the stillness of the night.    \"I know of our Queen's treacherous deed,\" replied Ervic, \"and I am  sorry for your misfortune. Have you been in the lake ever since?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply.    \"I--I hope you are well--and comfortable,\" stammered Ervic, not knowing  what else to say.    \"We knew that some day Coo-ee-oh would meet with the fate she so richly  deserves,\" declared the bronzefish. \"We have waited and watched for  this time. Now if you will promise to help us and will be faithful and  true, you can aid us in regaining our natural forms, and save yourself  and all your people from the dangers that now threaten you.\"    \"Well,\" said Ervic, \"you can depend on my doing the best I can. But I'm  no witch, nor magician, you must know.\"    \"All we ask is that you obey our instructions,\" returned the  silverfish. \"We know that you are honest and that you served Coo-ee-oh  only because you were obliged to in order to escape her anger. Do as we  command and all will be well.\"    \"I promise!\" exclaimed the young man. \"Tell me what I am to do first.\"    \"You will find in the bottom of your boat the silver cord which dropped  from Coo-ee-oh's hand when she was transformed,\" said the goldfish.  \"Tie one end of that cord to the bow of your boat and drop the other  end to us in the water. Together we will pull your boat to the shore.\"    Ervic much doubted that the three small fishes could move so heavy a  boat, but he did as he was told and the fishes all seized their end of  the silver cord in their mouths and headed toward the nearest shore,  which was the very place where the Flatheads had stood when they  conquered Queen Coo-ee-oh.    At first the boat did not move at all, although the fishes pulled with  all their strength. But presently the strain began to tell. Very slowly  the boat crept toward the shore, gaining more speed at every moment. A  couple of yards away from the sandy beach the fishes dropped the cord  from their mouths and swam to one side, while the iron boat, being now  under way, continued to move until its prow grated upon the sands.    Ervic leaned over the side and said to the fishes: \"What next?\"    \"You will find upon the sand,\" said the silverfish, \"a copper kettle,  which the Su-dic forgot when he went away. Cleanse it thoroughly in the  water of the lake, for it has had poison in it. When it is cleaned,  fill it with fresh water and hold it over the side of the boat, so that  we three may swim into the kettle. We will then instruct you further.\"    \"Do you wish me to catch you, then?\" asked Ervic in surprise.    \"Yes,\" was the reply.    So Ervic jumped out of the boat and found the copper kettle. Carrying  it a little way down the beach, he washed it well, scrubbing away every  drop of the poison it had contained with sand from the shore.    Then he went back to the boat.    Ervic's comrades were still sound asleep and knew nothing of the three  fishes or what strange happenings were taking place about them. Ervic  dipped the kettle in the lake, holding fast to the handle until it was  under water. The gold and silver and bronze fishes promptly swam into  the kettle. The young Skeezer then lifted it, poured out a little of  the water so it would not spill over the edge, and said to the fishes:  \"What next?\"    \"Carry the kettle to the shore. Take one hundred steps to the east,  along the edge of the lake, and then you will see a path leading  through the meadows, up hill and down dale. Follow the path until you  come to a cottage which is painted a purple color with white trimmings.  When you stop at the gate of this cottage we will tell you what to do  next. Be careful, above all, not to stumble and spill the water from  the kettle, or you would destroy us and all you have done would be in  vain.\"    The goldfish issued these commands and Ervic promised to be careful and  started to obey. He left his sleeping comrades in the boat, stepping  cautiously over their bodies, and on reaching the shore took exactly  one hundred steps to the east. Then he looked for the path and the  moonlight was so bright that he easily discovered it, although it was  hidden from view by tall weeds until one came full upon it. This path  was very narrow and did not seem to be much used, but it was quite  distinct and Ervic had no difficulty in following it. He walked through  a broad meadow, covered with tall grass and weeds, up a hill and down  into a valley and then up another hill and down again.    It seemed to Ervic that he had walked miles and miles. Indeed the moon  sank low and day was beginning to dawn when finally he discovered by  the roadside a pretty little cottage, painted purple with white  trimmings. It was a lonely place--no other buildings were anywhere  about and the ground was not tilled at all. No farmer lived here, that  was certain. Who would care to dwell in such an isolated place?    But Ervic did not bother his head long with such questions. He went up  to the gate that led to the cottage, set the copper kettle carefully  down and bending over it asked:    \"What next?\"          Chapter Seventeen    Under the Great Dome      When Glinda the Good and her followers of the Rescue Expedition came in  sight of the Enchanted Mountain of the Flatheads, it was away to the  left of them, for the route they had taken through the Great Forest was  some distance from that followed by Ozma and Dorothy.    They halted awhile to decide whether they should call upon the Supreme  Dictator first, or go on to the Lake of the Skeezers.    \"If we go to the mountain,\" said the Wizard, \"we may get into trouble  with that wicked Su-dic, and then we would be delayed in rescuing Ozma  and Dorothy. So I think our best plan will be to go to the Skeezer  Country, raise the sunken island and save our friends and the  imprisoned Skeezers. Afterward we can visit the mountain and punish the  cruel magician of the Flatheads.\"    \"That is sensible,\" approved the Shaggy Man. \"I quite agree with you.\"    The others, too, seemed to think the Wizard's plan the best, and Glinda  herself commended it, so on they marched toward the line of palm trees  that hid the Skeezers' lake from view.    Pretty soon they came to the palms. These were set closely together,  the branches, which came quite to the ground, being so tightly  interlaced that even the Glass Cat could scarcely find a place to  squeeze through. The path which the Flatheads used was some distance  away.    \"Here's a job for the Tin Woodman,\" said the Scarecrow.    So the Tin Woodman, who was always glad to be of use, set to work with  his sharp, gleaming axe, which he always carried, and in a surprisingly  short time had chopped away enough branches to permit them all to pass  easily through the trees.    Now the clear waters of the beautiful lake were before them and by  looking closely they could see the outlines of the Great Dome of the  sunken island, far from shore and directly in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#15)"],[1," beneath  this, and that the magnetism will be detruded to the poles and axis of  the earth, like the atmospheres of common air and of inflammable gas, as  explained in the note on Canto I. l. 123.    Electricity and heat will both of them displace magnetism, and this  shows that they may gravitate on each other; and hence when too great a  quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by  descending snows, or other unknown causes, it may have a tendency to  rise towards the tropics by its centrifugal force, and produce the  northern lights.

[_Diffusive Acids flow_. l. 215. The production of marine acid from  decomposing vegetable and animal matters with vital air, and of nitrous  acid from azote and vital air, the former of which is united to its  basis by means of the exhalations from vegetable and animal matters,  constitute an analogy which induces us to believe that many other acids  have either their bases or are united to vital air by means of some part  of decomposing vegetable and animal matters.    The great quantities of flint sand whether formed in mountains or in the  sea would appear to derive its acid from the new world, as it is found  above the strata of lime-stone and granite which constitute the old  world, and as the earthy basis of flint is probably calcareous, a great  part of it seems to be produced by a conjunction of the new and old  world; the recrements of air-breathing animals and vegetables probably  afford the acid, and the shells of marine animals the earthy basis,  while another part may have derived its calcareous part also from the  decomposition of vegetable and animal bodies.    The same mode of reasoning seems applicable to the siliceous stones  under various names, as amethyst, onyx, agate, mochoe, opal, &c. which  do not seem to have undergone any process from volcanic fires, and as  these stones only differ from flint by a greater or less admixture of  argillaceous and calcareous earths. The different proportions of which  in each kind of stone may be seen in Mr. Kirwan's valuable Elements of  Mineralogy. See additional notes, No. XIX.]    [_Living diamonds blaze_. l. 228. Sir Isaac Newton having observed the  great power of refracting light, which the diamond possesses above all  other crystallized or vitreous matter, conjectured that it was an  inflammable body in some manner congealed. Insomuch that all the light  is reflected which falls on any of its interior surfaces at a greater  angle of incidence than 241/2 degrees; whereas an artificial gem of  glass does not reflect any light from its hinder surface, unless that  surface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees. Hence the diamond  reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in similar  circumstances; to which must be added its great transparency, and the  excellent polish it is capable of. The diamond had nevertheless been  placed at the head of crystals or precious stones by the mineralogists,  till Bergman ranged it of late in the combustible class of bodies,  because by the focus of Villette's burning mirror it was evaporated by a  heat not much greater than will melt silver, and gave out light. Mr.  Hoepfner however thinks the dispersion of the diamond by this great heat  should be called a phosphorescent evaporation of it, rather than a  combustion; and from its other analogies of crystallization, hardness,  transparency, and place of its nativity, wishes again to replace it  amongst the precious stones.

The purer air or ether in the antient  mythology was represented by Jupiter, and the inferior air by Juno; and  the conjunction of these deities was said to produce the vernal showers,  and procreate all things, as is further spoken of in Canto III. l. 204.  It is now discovered that pure air, or oxygene, uniting with variety of  bases forms the various kinds of acids; as the vitriolic acid from pure  air and sulphur; the nitrous acid from pure air and phlogistic air, or  azote; and carbonic acid, (or fixed air,) from pure air and charcoal.  Some of these affinities were perhaps portrayed by the Magi of Egypt,  who were probably learned in chemistry, in their hieroglyphic pictures  before the invention of letters, by the loves of Jupiter with  terrestrial ladies.
