It is because government is a conflict of such arguments as that  letter states on the one side, because the object of government is the  object to which this lady's own life is devoted, that the friends of  woman suffrage and of this amendment ask that it shall be adopted.    Mr. VEST. Mr. President, my great personal respect for the Senator  from Massachusetts has given me an interval of enforced silence, and I  have only to say that if I should print my desultory remarks I should  be compelled to omit his interruption for fear that the amendment  would be larger than the original bill. [Laughter.]    I fail to see that anything which has fallen from the distinguished  Senator has convicted Mrs. Clara Leonard of inconsistency or has added  anything to the argument upon his side of the question. I have  never said or intimated that there were women who were not credible  witnesses. I have never thought or intimated that there were not women  who were competent to administer the affairs of State or even to lead  armies. There have been such women, and I believe there will be to the  end of time, as there have been effeminate men who have been better  adapted to the distaff and the spindle than to the sword or to  statesmanship. But these are exceptions in either sex.    If this lady have, as she unquestionably has, the strength of  intellect conceded to her by the Senator from Massachusetts and  evidenced by her own production, her judgment of woman is worth that  of a continent of men. The best judge of any woman is a woman. The  poorest judge of any woman is a man. Let any woman with defect or flaw  go amongst a community of men and she will be a successful impostor.  Let her go amongst a community of women and in one instant the  instinct, the atmosphere circumambient, will tell her story.    Mrs. Leonard gives us the result of her opinion and of her experience  as to whether this right of suffrage should be conferred upon her  own sex. The Senator from Massachusetts speaks of her evidence in a  political campaign in Massachusetts and that her unaided and single  evidence crushed down the governor of that great State. I thank the  Senator for that statement. If Mrs. Leonard had been an office-holder  and a voter not a single township would have believed the truth of  what she uttered.    Mr. HOAR. She was an office-holder, and the governor tried to put her  out.    Mr. VEST. Ah! but what sort of an office-holder? She held the office  delegated to her by God himself, a ministering angel to the sick, the  afflicted, and the insane. What man in his senses would take from  woman this sphere? What man would close to her the charitable  institutions and eleemosynary establishments of the country? That is  part of her kingdom; that is part of her undisputed sway and realm. Is  that the office to which woman suffragists of this country ask us now  to admit them? Is it to be the director of a hospital? Is it to the  presidency of a board of visitors of an eleemosynary institution? Oh,  no; they want to be Presidents, to be Senators, and Members of the  House of Representatives, and, God save the mark, ministerial and  executive officers, sheriffs, constables, and marshals.    Of course, this lady is found in this board of directors. Where else  should a true woman be found? Where else has she always been found but  by the fevered brow, the palsied hand, the erring intellect, ay, God  bless them, from the cradle to the grave the guide and support of the  faltering steps of childhood and the weakening steps of old age!    Oh, no, Mr. President; this will not do. If we are to tear down all  the blessed traditions, if we are to desolate our homes and firesides,  if we are to unsex our mothers and wives and sisters and turn our  blessed temples of domestic peace into ward political-assembly rooms,  pass this joint resolution. But for one I thank God that I am so  old-fashioned that I would not give one memory of my grandmother or my  mother for all the arguments that could be piled, Pelion upon Ossa, in  favor of this political monstrosity.    I now propose to read from a pamphlet sent to me by a lady whom I  am not able to characterize as a resident of any State, although I  believe she resides in the State of Maine. I do not know whether she  be wife or mother. She signs this pamphlet as Adeline D.T. Whitney. I  have read it twice, and read it to pure and gentle and intellectual  women. I say to-day it ought to be in every household in this broad  land. It ought to be the domestic gospel of every true, gentle,  loving, virtuous woman upon all this continent. There is not one line  or syllable in it that is not written in letters of gold. I shall not  read it, for my strength does not suffice, nor will the patience of  the Senate permit, but from beginning to end it breathes the womanly  sentiment which has made pure and great men and gentle and loving  women.    I will venture to say, in my great admiration and respect for this  woman, whether she be married or single, she ought to be a wife, and  ought to be a mother. Such a woman could only have brave and wise men  for sons and pure and virtuous women for daughters. Here is her advice  to her sex. I am only sorry that every word of it could not be read in  the Senate, but I have trespassed too long.    Mr. COCKRELL. Let it be printed in your remarks.    Mr. VEST. I shall ask that it be printed. I will undertake, however,  to read only a few sentences, not of exceptional superiority to the  rest, because every sentence is equal to every other. There is not one  impure unintellectual aspiration or thought throughout the whole of  it. Would to God that I knew her, that I could thank her on behalf of  the society and politics of the United States for this production.    After all--    She says to her own sex--        After all, men work for women; or, if they think they do not, it      would leave them but sorry satisfaction to abandon them to such      existence as they could arrange without us.    Oh, how true that is; how true!    In blessed homes, or in scattered dissipations of show, amusement, or  the worse which these shows and amusements are but terribly akin to,  women give purpose to and direct the results of all men's work. If  the false standards of living first urge them, until at length the  horrible intoxication of the game itself drives them on further and  deeper, are we less responsible for the last state of those men than  for the first?    Do you say, if good women refused these things and tried for a simpler  and truer living, there are plenty of bad ones who would take them  anyhow, and supply the motive to deeper and more unmitigated evil? Ah,  there come both answer and errand again. Raise the fallen--at  least, save the growing womanhood--stop the destruction that rushes  accelerating on, before you challenge new difficulty and danger with  an indiscriminate franchise. Are not these bad women the very \"plenty\"  that would out-balance you at the polls if you persist in trying the  \"patch-and-plaster\" remedy of suffrage and legislation.    Recognize the fact, the law, that your power, your high commission, is  inward, vital, formative and causal. Bring all questions of choice  or duty to this test; will it work at the heart of things, among the  realities and forces? Try your own life by this; remember that mere  external is falsehood and death. The letter killeth. Give up all that  is only of the appearance, or even chiefly so, in conscious  delight and motive--in person, surrounding, pursuit. Let your  self-presentation, your home-making and adorning, your social effort  and interest, your occupation and use of talent, all shape and issue  for the things that are essentially and integrally good, and that the  world needs to have prevail. Until you can do this, and induce such  doing, it is of little use to clamor for mere outward right or to  contend that it would be rightly applied.    This whole pamphlet is a magnificent illustration of that stupendous  and vital truth that the mission and sphere of woman is in the inward  life of man; that she must be the building up and governing power that  comes from those better impulses, those inward secrets of the heart  and sentiment that govern men to do all that is good and pure and holy  and keep them from all that is evil.    Mr. President, the emotions of women govern. What would be the result  of woman suffrage if applied to the large cities of this country is a  matter of speculation. What women have done in times of turbulence and  excitement in large cities in the past we know. Open that terrible  page of the French Revolution and the days of terror, when the click  of the guillotine and the rush of blood through the streets of Paris  demonstrated to what extremities the ferocity of human nature can be  driven by political passion. Who led those blood-thirsty mobs? Who  shrieked loudest in that hurricane of passion? Woman. Her picture upon  the pages of history to-day is indelible. In the city of Paris in  those ferocious mobs the controlling agency, nay, not agency, but the  controlling and principal power, came from those whom God has intended  to be the soft and gentle angels of mercy throughout the world. But I  have said more than I intended. I ask that this pamphlet be printed in  my remarks.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no objection, the pamphlet will be  printed in the RECORD as requested by the Senator from Missouri. The  Chair hears no objection.    The pamphlet is as follows:        THE LAW OF WOMAN-LIFE.        The external arguments on both sides the modern woman question      have been pretty thoroughly presented and well argued. It seems      needless to repeat or recombine them; but in one relation they      have scarcely been handled with any direct purpose. Justice and      expediency have been the points insisted on or contested; these   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#16)"],[1,"is the biggest ruffian of you all!\"    \"Back it up! back it up!\"    \"I can!\"    \"Why don't you?\"    \"I will when the right time comes.\"    \"What's the matter with this for the right time?\"    \"No! no! Turn to the right and let us pass now. We will see you again.\"    \"We see you now, and we are going to raise you the limit.\"    The sophomores held a hurried consultation, and then Browning said:    \"If you fellows will wait till we go change our clothes we'll come out  and give you as warm a time as you want.\"    \"All right, we will wait.\"    \"Then let us pass.\"    \"We'll do that, but you will have to pass on the outside.\"    That was something the sophomores could not do without yielding to the  freshmen, and they felt that they had rather die than yield unless  compelled to do so.    The sophomores stormed and scolded, and the freshmen, who outnumbered  them, laughed and flung back taunts.    Then the sophomores determined on a quick, sudden rush, but it happened  that the freshmen had decided on a rush at the same moment, and the two  bodies of lads plunged forward as if at one signal.    \"'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight!\" yelled the freshmen.    \"'Umpty-seven! 'Umpty-seven!\" shouted the sophomores.    Crash! They met!    Then there occurred one of the liveliest struggles of the season up to  that date. Each side did its best to force the other off the sidewalk,  and for some moments they swayed and surged in one spot.    At last the superior weight of the freshmen began to tell, and the  sophomores were slowly swept backward, contending every inch.    Feeling that they must be crowded to the outside, Browning gave the  signal for them to break and make it a hand-to-hand affair. Then he  grappled with Merriwell.    Frank was ready, and he willingly left the line as the freshmen forged  onward. He was anxious for an opportunity of seeing just what sort of  stuff the king of the sophomores was made of, and this was his chance.    Finding that they could not hold the freshmen back, the sophs had each  singled out a man, and the contest became hand to hand.    In a few moments several parties were down, and some of them rolled from  the sidewalk into the street.    Now that they had been forced to do battle, the sophs were desperate,  and they sailed in like a lot of tigers.    Rattleton found himself pitted against Andy Emery, and Emery had the  reputation of being as full of grit as a bulldog. He was on the 'Varsity  crew, and he had a back and shoulders which were the admiration of those  who had seen him strip to the buff.    Emery had a quick temper and a strong arm. He grappled with Harry,  lifted him off his feet and tried to throw him, but the freshman came  down on his feet like a cat.    A second later Emery was astonished to feel his own feet flung into the  air, and he could not help falling, but he clung to his antagonist and  they went down together.    Over and over they rolled, each striving to get on top. They were soon  off the sidewalk and into the street.    Emery was furious, for he felt that his dress suit was the same as  ruined, and he uttered some very savage language.    \"That's right,\" chuckled Harry. \"Cuss a little--it may help you.\"    It seemed to, for Emery finally succeeded in getting astride Rattleton  and holding him down for a few moments. He was soon pulled off by  another freshman, and the merry war went on.    Little Tad Horner was right in the hottest scrimmage, and he proved  formidable for the freshmen, despite his size. He had a way of darting  under them and tripping them up, then getting away before he could be  grappled.    Dismal Jones was quoting Scripture and doing his best to make himself  felt by the sophomores. Jones was a character. His parents were  \"shouting Methodists,\" and they intended him for the ministry. He had a  long, sad face, but he was full of deviltry, and it was very seldom that  the freshmen entered into any affair against the sophomores that he was  not on hand and interested.    \"Lay on and spare not!\" he cried, after the style of a camp-meeting  revivalist. \"If the wicked entice thee, consent thou not. Get behind me,  Satan! Brothers, oh, my dear brothers! it makes my heart sad and weary  to see so much wicked strife and contention.\"    Punch Swallows, the red-headed soph, found himself pitted against Lucy  Little. Despite his name, Little was not a \"sissy,\" and he was no mean  antagonist, as Punch found out. It was nip and tuck between them, and  neither seemed to have the best of it.    Some of the sophs were able to down their men, but they were so  outnumbered by the freshmen that they could not hold an advantage very  long.    The struggle between Browning and Merriwell waxed furious. The big  sophomore exerted himself to his utmost, and he found that it was  necessary that he should do so if he had any thought of holding his own  with the freshman leader.    Frank knew all the time that he was pitted against a hard man, and so  his muscles were strained and his nerves were taut.    \"Now, fresh, we'll see what we can do for you,\" Browning said, as he  made a mighty effort to land Frank on his back.    \"You are very kind,\" laughed Merriwell. \"I will not forget your  kindness.\"    \"You are not the only one,\" panted Browning. \"There are others.\"    \"Are you going to the party this evening?\" chuckled Frank.    \"Not till I have done you up, my friend with the swelled head.\"    \"Then you expect to be rather late?\"    \"We'll see!\"    Frank resorted to all the tricks he knew, but Browning was familiar with  every one of them. They gave up trying to down each other by main  strength, and science cut quite a figure in their battle.    At length Browning got Frank foul, and to his dismay the leader of the  freshmen felt himself falling. Browning fell with him, a cry of triumph  coming to his lips.    That cry turned to an exclamation of dismay, for Merriwell seemed to  twist about in the air, and they fell side by side on the ground. In a  twinkling they were at it again, and over and over they went, till they  finally stopped and got upon their feet together.    \"Very good thus far,\" laughed Merriwell. \"But I see your wind will not  hold out. I am bound to do you in the end.\"    That was the very thing Browning feared.    \"Well, I don't know about that,\" he said as he broke Frank's grip. \"This  may settle the whole business.\"    He struck hard and straight at Merriwell's face!          CHAPTER XIII.    JUBILANT FRESHMEN.      Spat!    Merriwell staggered.    \"Down you go!\"    Browning followed the freshman closely, launching out again, with the  full expectation that the second blow would be a settler.    Frank had been taken slightly off his guard, so that he had failed in  getting away from the first blow, but he skillfully ducked the second,  countering as the king's fist passed over his shoulder.    Browning reeled backward, having received a terrific crack on the ear.    If Frank had not been slightly dazed he might have followed the  sophomore closely, but he was a bit slow in getting after Bruce.    For a few seconds the boys gave an exhibition of scientific sparring  which would have proved very interesting to their comrades if all had  not been too busy to watch them.    Frank Merriwell contiuued to laugh, and it had been said at Yale that  he was most dangerous in an encounter when he laughed.    \"You came near doing it, Browning,\" he admitted, \"but it was rather  tricky on your part. I wasn't looking for a fight.\"    \"You will get many things you are not looking for before you have been  at Yale much longer,\" returned the king.    \"Think so?\"    \"Dead sure.\"    The two lads seemed to be very evenly matched, save that Merriwell was  the more catlike on his feet. Browning was solid, and it took a terrific  blow to stagger him. Merriwell was plainly the more scientific. He could  get in and away from his foe in a most successful manner, but he saw  that in the confined limits of a ring Browning's rush would be difficult  to escape.    What the result of this encounter might have been cannot be told, for  two freshmen suddenly appeared and gave the alarm that at least a  hundred sophomores were coming in a body to aid their comrades.    A moment later the sophs appeared, hurrying along the street toward the  scene of the encounter.    \"'Umpty-seven! 'Umpty-seven! Rah! rah! 'rah!\"    Then the signal was given for the freshmen to break away and take to  flight, which they promptly did.    \"Oh, soph--oh, my poor soph!\" cried many taunting voices.    \"Good-evening, gentlemen!\" called Bandy Robinson. \"Shall I toss you down  soap and towels?\"    \"Say, fellows,\" cried Lucy Little, \"don't you think it is rather warm  out this evening?\"    \"Hello! hello!\" shouted Rattleton. \"Has it been raining, or did we have  a small shower?\"    Then Merriwell's beautiful baritone voice pitched the chorus of a  familiar negro melody, in which the triumphant and delighted freshmen  joined:      \"Git erway from de window, mah love an' mah dove!    Git erway from de window--don't yeh heah?      Come eround some odder night,      For dere's gwine ter be er fight,    An' dar'll be razzers er-flyin' through de air.\"    The sophomores retired to a safe distance and then challenged the  freshmen to come out and fight. They called them cowards and other  things, but the freshmen laughed and taunted them in return.    \"Is--er--King Browning present?\" yelled a freshman, leaning out of a  window. \"If so, I'd like to inquire if he means to attend the party this  evening.\"    \"If he does,\" said another freshman, \"he will be able to obtain a dress  suit down at Cohen's, price 'von tollar ber efenin' to shentlemen.'\"    \"Oh, you wait till we get at you fresh ducks!\" shouted back an angry  sophomore. \"We'll make you sweat for this!\"    \"Go on! you're only fooling!\" sang the freshmen.    \"We'll show you we're not fooling!\" excitedly declared Punch Swallow.  \"We'll scalp a few of"]]]
