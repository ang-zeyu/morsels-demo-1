They see them often; but always they enjoy them for no two are  precisely alike.    For a time it seemed to Tarzan that Buto, the rhinoceros, would prove  victor in the gory battle.  Already had he accounted for four of the  seven lions and badly wounded the three remaining when in a momentary  lull in the encounter he sank limply to his knees and rolled over upon  his side.  Tarzan's spear had done its work.  It was the man-made  weapon which killed the great beast that might easily have survived the  assault of seven mighty lions, for Tarzan's spear had pierced the great  lungs, and Buto, with victory almost in sight, succumbed to internal  hemorrhage.    Then Tarzan came down from his sanctuary and as the wounded lions,  growling, dragged themselves away, the ape-man cut his spear from the  body of Buto, hacked off a steak and vanished into the jungle.  The  episode was over.  It had been all in the day's work--something which  you and I might talk about for a lifetime Tarzan dismissed from his  mind the moment that the scene passed from his sight.          12    La Seeks Vengeance      Swinging back through the jungle in a wide circle the ape-man came to  the river at another point, drank and took to the trees again and while  he hunted, all oblivious of his past and careless of his future, there  came through the dark jungles and the open, parklike places and across  the wide meadows, where grazed the countless herbivora of the  mysterious continent, a weird and terrible caravan in search of him.  There were fifty frightful men with hairy bodies and gnarled and  crooked legs.  They were armed with knives and great bludgeons and at  their head marched an almost naked woman, beautiful beyond compare.  It  was La of Opar, High Priestess of the Flaming God, and fifty of her  horrid priests searching for the purloiner of the sacred sacrificial  knife.    Never before had La passed beyond the crumbling outer walls of Opar;  but never before had need been so insistent.  The sacred knife was  gone!  Handed down through countless ages it had come to her as a  heritage and an insignia of her religious office and regal authority  from some long-dead progenitor of lost and forgotten Atlantis.  The  loss of the crown jewels or the Great Seal of England could have  brought no greater consternation to a British king than did the  pilfering of the sacred knife bring to La, the Oparian, Queen and High  Priestess of the degraded remnants of the oldest civilization upon  earth.  When Atlantis, with all her mighty cities and her cultivated  fields and her great commerce and culture and riches sank into the sea  long ages since, she took with her all but a handful of her colonists  working the vast gold mines of Central Africa.  From these and their  degraded slaves and a later intermixture of the blood of the  anthropoids sprung the gnarled men of Opar; but by some queer freak of  fate, aided by natural selection, the old Atlantean strain had remained  pure and undegraded in the females descended from a single princess of  the royal house of Atlantis who had been in Opar at the time of the  great catastrophe.  Such was La.    Burning with white-hot anger was the High Priestess, her heart a  seething, molten mass of hatred for Tarzan of the Apes.  The zeal of  the religious fanatic whose altar has been desecrated was triply  enhanced by the rage of a woman scorned.  Twice had she thrown her  heart at the feet of the godlike ape-man and twice had she been  repulsed.  La knew that she was beautiful--and she was beautiful, not  by the standards of prehistoric Atlantis alone, but by those of modern  times was La physically a creature of perfection.  Before Tarzan came  that first time to Opar, La had never seen a human male other than the  grotesque and knotted men of her clan.  With one of these she must mate  sooner or later that the direct line of high priestesses might not be  broken, unless Fate should bring other men to Opar.  Before Tarzan came  upon his first visit, La had had no thought that such men as he  existed, for she knew only her hideous little priests and the bulls of  the tribe of great anthropoids that had dwelt from time immemorial in  and about Opar, until they had come to be looked upon almost as equals  by the Oparians.  Among the legends of Opar were tales of godlike men  of the olden time and of black men who had come more recently; but  these latter had been enemies who killed and robbed.  And, too, these  legends always held forth the hope that some day that nameless  continent from which their race had sprung, would rise once more out of  the sea and with slaves at the long sweeps would send her carven,  gold-picked galleys forth to succor the long-exiled colonists.    The coming of Tarzan had aroused within La's breast the wild hope that  at last the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy was at hand; but more  strongly still had it aroused the hot fires of love in a heart that  never otherwise would have known the meaning of that all-consuming  passion, for such a wondrous creature as La could never have felt love  for any of the repulsive priests of Opar.  Custom, duty and religious  zeal might have commanded the union; but there could have been no love  on La's part.  She had grown to young womanhood a cold and heartless  creature, daughter of a thousand other cold, heartless, beautiful women  who had never known love.  And so when love came to her it liberated  all the pent passions of a thousand generations, transforming La into a  pulsing, throbbing volcano of desire, and with desire thwarted this  great force of love and gentleness and sacrifice was transmuted by its  own fires into one of hatred and revenge.    It was in a state of mind superinduced by these conditions that La led  forth her jabbering company to retrieve the sacred emblem of her high  office and wreak vengeance upon the author of her wrongs.  To Werper  she gave little thought.  The fact that the knife had been in his hand  when it departed from Opar brought down no thoughts of vengeance upon  his head.  Of course, he should be slain when captured; but his death  would give La no pleasure--she looked for that in the contemplated  death agonies of Tarzan.  He should be tortured.  His should be a slow  and frightful death.  His punishment should be adequate to the  immensity of his crime.  He had wrested the sacred knife from La; he  had lain sacrilegious hands upon the High Priestess of the Flaming God;  he had desecrated the altar and the temple.  For these things he should  die; but he had scorned the love of La, the woman, and for this he  should die horribly with great anguish.    The march of La and her priests was not without its adventures.  Unused  were these to the ways of the jungle, since seldom did any venture  forth from behind Opar's crumbling walls, yet their very numbers  protected them and so they came without fatalities far along the trail  of Tarzan and Werper.  Three great apes accompanied them and to these  was delegated the business of tracking the quarry, a feat beyond the  senses of the Oparians.  La commanded.  She arranged the order of  march, she selected the camps, she set the hour for halting and the  hour for resuming and though she was inexperienced in such matters, her  native intelligence was so far above that of the men or the apes that  she did better than they could have done.  She was a hard taskmaster,  too, for she looked down with loathing and contempt upon the misshapen  creatures amongst which cruel Fate had thrown her and to some extent  vented upon them her dissatisfaction and her thwarted love.  She made  them build her a strong protection and shelter each night and keep a  great fire burning before it from dusk to dawn.  When she tired of  walking they were forced to carry her upon an improvised litter, nor  did one dare to question her authority or her right to such services.  In fact they did not question either.  To them she was a goddess and  each loved her and each hoped that he would be chosen as her mate, so  they slaved for her and bore the stinging lash of her displeasure and  the habitually haughty disdain of her manner without a murmur.    For many days they marched, the apes following the trail easily and  going a little distance ahead of the body of the caravan that they  might warn the others of impending danger.  It was during a noonday  halt while all were lying resting after a tiresome march that one of  the apes rose suddenly and sniffed the breeze.  In a low guttural he  cautioned the others to silence and a moment later was swinging quietly  up wind into the jungle.  La and the priests gathered silently  together, the hideous little men fingering their knives and bludgeons,  and awaited the return of the shaggy anthropoid.    Nor had they long to wait before they saw him emerge from a leafy  thicket and approach them.  Straight to La he came and in the language  of the great apes which was also the language of decadent Opar he  addressed her.    \"The great Tarmangani lies asleep there,\" he said, pointing in the  direction from which he had just come.  \"Come and we can kill him.\"    \"Do not kill him,\" commanded La in cold tones.  \"Bring the great  Tarmangani to me alive and unhurt.  The vengeance is La's.  Go; but  make no sound!\" and she waved her hands to include all her followers.    Cautiously the weird party crept through the jungle in the wake of the  great ape until at last he halted them with a raised hand and pointed  upward and a little ahead.  There they saw the giant form of the  ape-man stretched along a low bough and even in sleep one hand grasped  a stout limb and one strong, brown leg reached out and overlapped  another.  At ease lay Tarzan of the Apes, sleeping heavily upon a full  stomach and dreaming of Numa, the lion, and Horta, the boar, and other  creatures of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#15)"],[1,"see a beacon-light, portends fair seas and  a prosperous voyage.

If the water fails to destroy them, some serious complication  with fatal results is not improbable.    _Bed Fellow_.
