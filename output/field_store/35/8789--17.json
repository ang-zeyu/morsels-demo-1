Mrs.  Gilmore had good business sense. She lived alone with Hattie, ran the  farm, and soon her interests degenerated into a slavery to household  and farm details.    The widow had taught school until she was nearly thirty. She was not  handsome, and the meager sentiment of her soul easily disintegrated  into morbidness. She wore black the rest of her days, and for the rest  of her days church services were hours of public mourning. The Gilmore  \"parlor\" was closed after the funeral, and Hattie never got a glimpse  within its almost gruesomely sacred walls, save as she timidly peeped  in during cleaning days or, rarely, when her mother tearfully led her  in and they stood before the life-size crayon portrait of the  departed. Even in her quiet play, Hattie must keep on the other side  of the house.    Hattie Gilmore was a sober child and lived a sober childhood. She was  not strong; nothing had ever been done to make her so. Play and  playmates were always limited. She and her mother belonged to  Coopersville's \"better class,\" most of the town children living below  the bridge where the homes of the factory people crowded. Boys were  \"too rough,\" and the other girls were \"not nice enough\"; so she played  much alone--such play as it was, with her two china dolls and the tin  stove and tin dishes, which made up her toys. There was little to  stimulate her imagination and nothing to develop comradeships and  friendships. For hours of her play-time she sat inertly on the front  stoop and watched the passersby, for there had never been any thought  of training her in the art of play. Instead, she was warned to keep  her dress clean and rather sharply reprimanded if, perchance, dress or  apron was torn. So she stood and watched the school-play of the other  children, never knowing the thrills of a game of \"tag,\" nor the  reckless adventures of \"black man\"; even \"Pussy wants a corner\"  disarranged her painfully curled curls and was rarely risked. \"Hop-  scotch,\" when the figure was small and lady-like, was practically the  limit of Hattie's \"violent exercise.\" So she did not develop-how could  she! She remained undersized. Moreover, her play-days were sadly  shortened, for they early merged into work-days. Housekeeping cares  were many, as her mother planned her household. According to York  State traditions Hattie was early taught domestic details, and for  over a generation seriously, slavishly followed the routine  established by her mother who doggedly, to the last, knew no shadow of  turning, and went to her honestly earned long rest within a week after  she took to her bed. Hattie finished the town high school, and had  taken her school-work so seriously that she was valedictorian--being  too good to soil your dress ought to bring some reward. Her teacher  proudly referred to her as an example of the fine work a student could  do who was not disturbed by outside influences. Commencement night,  the same summer she was seventeen, she was almost pretty. The natural  flush of success and of public recognition was heightened by the  reflected flush from the red roses she wore; and Ben Stimson, the old  doctor's son, carried the image of this, her most beautiful self, in  his big heart for many years. He was then twenty, a sophomore at  college, and a wholesome fellow to look upon. He took Hattie home that  night. It was early June, and they dallied on the way. She was so  nearly happy that her conscience became suspicious. She felt something  awful was going to happen!--and she almost did not care. They had  reached the front steps of her home. Ominously, silence fell. Suddenly  impulsive Ben crushed her to him and--must it be told?--kissed her,  kissed Hattie Gilmore's unsullied lips. For a moment her heart leaped  almost into wanton expression. A moment more--another kiss, and she  might have been compromised, she might have responded to the thrilling  love which was calling to her heart, but the goddess of her destiny  willed otherwise. The front door opened; an angular form appeared; an  acrid voice fairly curdled love-thoughts as it assailed the impetuous  lover. Within a minute he was slinking away and the rescued maiden was  safe in the indignant, resenting arms of her mother--safe, but for  years to be tempted and troubled by remorse and wishes, to be haunted  by unaccepted hopes. \"Ben Stimson is a free lance. He can't help  being, for his father's a free thinker and the boy never went to  Sunday-school a dozen times in his life. Let him join the church and  show folks he wants to live right; then, if he courts you regular, I  won't mind, but he is too free and easy. I call that kind dangerous,\"  her mother said.    Ben Stimson wrote Hattie a note the next day, which she did not  answer, but kept for years. Two summers later he drove up to the  house, looking mighty fine in the doctor's new runabout, driving the  high-stepping bay, natty in a \"brand-new\" tan harness--the first  Hattie had ever seen. He asked her to come with him for a drive, and  again her mother's nipping negative influenced her decision against  the pleadings of a yearning, lonely heart.    Mrs. Gilmore finally died an exclusive, matter-of-fact, joyless death,  even as she had lived. Ben came to the funeral. He called on Hattie  the next day. Inconstancy was not one of his weaknesses, and the veil  of her Commencement beauty had clung to her through these many years,  in her old lover's eyes. He was again impetuous and offended every  conservative propriety of Hattie's dutiful melancholy by asking her to  marry him--and this actually in the room where her mother's funeral  was held the day before! What could Hattie do but burst into tears and  leave the room--and Ben, and the secretly cherished hopes of many  years, and a real home with a cheerily happy husband and those  children which might have been hers--to leave all these and more in  homage to the sacredness of her mother's memory.    Ten gray years dragged by. Hattie kept a few boarders so as not to be  alone in the house. She would take no children. They were too noisy  and kept the place in disorder. Ben's patience had finally exhausted,  though he finished his medical course and had been practicing nearly  ten years before he married. No other one for whom she could care even  called.    The farm did well. The lone woman had over $20,000 in the bank and the  property was worth as much more. But the brightest days were gray. At  forty-five she weighed ninety-four. She ate barely enough to keep  going. Her digestion was wretched. Her pride and her will alone made  her able to sit through meals or through the occasional neighbors'  calls. She spent hours alone in her room, dumb, dark-minded, with an  unrelenting heartache and pains which racked every organ. Her sleep  was fitful and she dreamed of Ben downstairs in a casket, again and  again, until she fairly feared the night. When she took her nerve  medicine, she seemed tied, bound hand and foot in that parlor of  death, held by a sleep of terror. Then Ben would move about in the  casket and make tortured faces at her, and some horrible times he  accused, even berated her. Finally an awful dream, two caskets, her  mother in one, Ben in the other, each railing and both showering abuse  upon her. She was in bed for weeks. Another doctor came and then-  praise be! her deliverer.    Jane Andrews was the old Presbyterian minister's daughter. She had  lived in Coopersville until she was twenty-four, giving her father an  efficient, devoted daughter's care through his long, last illness. The  family means had always been limited, and when the earner was laid  away, she at once responded to the practical call. There were no  hospitals near; so she left home and went into training in a small  institution on the Hudson. This is a hospital where sickness is  recognized as more than infections and broken, mangled members. Here  she learned well the saving balm of joy in making whole wretched  bodies with their more wretched souls. For five years she had lived in  the midst of benefits brought by the inspiration of right-feeling  attitudes. She knew full well the healing potency of the play-spirit.  Her insight into life was already deep, her outlook upon life high and  heartful. Then her mother failed; she came home and for three months  had been beautifying the final weeks, This more than wise woman now  came to nurse poor Hattie, came to companion her back to health, came  as a revelation to this mistaken and wearied one, of a better way.  After forty-five years of the playless life of a serf to blighting  seriousness, the wonder is that sourness had not entered to hopelessly  curdle all chances for joyous living.    Hattie Gilmore had to be taught to play. During the weeks of her rest-  treatment the stronger woman took the weaker back to girlhood. She  brought some dolls. They made clothes for them. They dressed and  undressed them and put them to bed. They taught them to say their  prayers and prepared their little meals, teaching them \"table  manners,\" and they made them play as children should play. A sunshine  scrapbook was made. It was a gorgeous conglomeration of colors, of  fairies and children, of birds and flowers, and of awkward, but  telling, hand-illustrations of the joys of being nursed and,  prophetically, of the greater joys of being well. They played  \"Authors,\" \"Flinch,\" and even \"Old Maid.\" Splendid half-hours were  spent in reading gloriously happy lives. Stories were told--happiness  stories, and jokes and conundrums invented. One day Hattie laughed  aloud, for which heartlessness her morbid conscience at once wrung  forth a stream of tears; but that wondrously artful nurse held a  mirror before a woefully twisting face, and her tactful comments  brought back the smiles. That laugh was the first warming beam of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#15)"],[1,"the world's great battles. In view of these Book of Mormon facts one  would naturally expect to find some evidences in this section of the  country for such wonderful historical events. Here one has a right to  expect the evidences of military fortifications; for, though a thousand  years had elapsed between the destruction of the Nephites and the  discovery of America by the Europeans, still some military monuments  would doubtless survive that length of time. Fortunately we are not  without kind of evidences that may be reasonably expected. We find such  historical monuments described in the \"American Antiquities\" of Josiah  Priest, published in Albany, New York. Before quoting, however, I call  attention to the fact that Mr. Priest regarded the fortifications  and other evidences of great battles fought south of lake Ontario as  marking the struggle between the descendants of Tartar races (our  American Indians, in his view) and Scandinavians, whom he assumes had  penetrated into middle New York during the first half of the tenth  century A. D. Of course, I am of the opinion that both the Tartar  theory of the origin of some of our American Indians, and Mr. Priest's  assumption that Scandinavians had pushed their way into the interior  of New York, are both improbable; but his theories do not vitiate the  facts of which he is the compiler and witness; but these facts, I am  sure, better fit the statements of the Book of Mormon than they do his  speculations. The reader will therefore bear in mind that it is the  facts of Mr. Priest that are of value to us, not his theories; and here  are the facts: [2]        There are the remains of one of those efforts of Scandinavian      defense, situated on a hill of singular form, on the great      sandplain between the Susquehannah and Chemung rivers, near their      junction. The hill is entirely isolated, about three-fourths of      a mile in circumference, and more than one hundred feet high. It      has been supposed to be artificial, and to belong to the ancient      nations to which all works of this sort generally belong. In the      surrounding plain are many deep holes, of twenty or thirty rods      in circumference, and twenty feet deep--favoring a belief that      from these the earth was scooped out, to form the hill with. It      is four acres large on its top, and perfectly level, beautifully      situated to overlook the country to a great distance, up and down      both rivers; there is on its top the remains of a wall, formed of      earth, stone and wood, which runs round the whole, exactly on the      brow. The wood is decayed and turned to mould, yet it is traceable,      and easily distinguished from the natural earth: within is a deep      ditch or entrenchment, running around the whole summit. [3] From      this it is evident that a war was once waged here; and were we to      conjecture between whom, we should say between the Indians and      Scandinavians, and that this fortification, so advantageously      chosen, is of the same class of defensive works with those about      Onondaga, [4] Auburn, [5] and the lakes Ontario, Cayuga, Seneca,      Oneida [6] and Erie. * * * * * * * In Pompey, [Onondaga county]      [7] on lot No. 14, is the site of an ancient burying ground,      upon which, when the country was first settled, was found timber      growing, apparently of the second growth, judging from the old      timber reduced to mould, lying round, which was one hundred years      old, ascertained by counting the concentric grains. In one of these      graves was found a glass bottle about the size of a common junk      bottle, having a stopple in its nozzle, and in the bottle was a      liquid of some sort, but was tasteless. But is it possible that the      Scandinavians could have had glass in their possession at so early      a period as the year 950 and thereabout, so as to have brought it      with them from Europe when their first settlements were made in      this country? We see no good reason why not, as glass had been      known three hundred years in Europe before the northern Europeans      are reputed to have found this country, the art of making glass      having been discovered in A. D. 664. But in other parts of the      world, glass had been known from time immemorial, even from the      flood, as it has been found in the Tower of Babel [8] * * * * *      * In the same grave with the bottle was found an iron hatchet,      edged with steel. The eye, or place for the helve, was round, and      extended or projected out, like the ancient Swiss or German axe.      On lot No. 9, in the same town, [Pompey] was another aboriginal      burying ground, covered with forest trees, as the other. In the      same town, on lot No. 17, were found the remains of a blacksmith's      forge; at this spot have been ploughed up crucibles, such as      mineralogists use in refining metals. These axes are similar, and      correspond in character with those found in the nitrous caves on      the Gasconade river, which empties into the Missouri, as mentioned      by Professor Beck's Gazetteer of that country. In the same town     [Pompey] are the remains of two ancient forts or fortifications,      with redoubts of a very extensive and formidable character.      Within the range of these works have been found pieces of cast      iron, broken from some vessel of considerable thickness. These      articles cannot well be ascribed to the era of the French war, as      time enough since, then, till the region round about Onondaga was      commenced to be cultivated, had not elapsed to give the growth of      timber found on the spot, of the age above noticed; and, added to      this, it is said that the Indians occupying that tract of country      had no tradition of their authors. [9] * * * * * * The hatchets or      iron axes found here were likely of the same origin with the pieces      of cast iron. In ploughing the earth, digging wells, canals, or      excavating for salt waters, about the lakes, new discoveries are      frequently made, which as clearly show the operations of ancient      civilization here, as the works of the present race would do, were      they left to the operations of time for five or six hundred years;      especially were this country totally to be overrun by the whole      consolidated savage tribes of the west, exterminating both the      worker and his works, as appears to have been done in ages past. In      Scipio, [10] on Salmon creek, a Mr. Halsted has, from time to time      during ten years past, ploughed up, on a certain extent of land on      his farm, seven or eight hundred pounds of brass, which appeared to      have once been formed into various implements, both of husbandry      and war; helmets and working utensils mingled together. The finder      of this brass, we are informed as he discovered it carried it to      Auburn, and sold it by the pound, where it was worked up, with as      little curiosity attending as though it had been but an ordinary      article of the country's produce: when, if it had been announced      in some public manner, the finder would have doubtless been highly      rewarded by some scientific individual or society, and preserved it      in the cabinets of the antiquarian, as a relic of by-gone ages of      the highest interest. On this field, where it was found, the forest      timber was growing as abundantly, and had attained to as great age      and size, as elsewhere in the heavy timbered country of the lakes.      [11] * * * * * * In Pompey, [12] Onondago county, are the remains,      or outlines, of a town, including more than 500 acres. It appeared      protected by three circular or eliptical forts, eight miles distant      from each other; placed in such relative positions as to form a      triangle round about the town, at those distances. It is thought,      from appearances, that this stronghold was stormed and taken on the      line of the north side. In Camillus, [13] in the same county, are      the remains of two forts, one covering about three acres, on a very      high hill; it had gateways, one opening to the east, and the other      to the west, toward a spring, some rods from the works. Its shape      is eliptical; it has a wall, in some places ten feet high, with a      deep ditch. Not far from this is another, exactly like it, only      half as large. There are many of these ancient works hereabouts;      one in Scipio, two near Auburn, three near Canandaigua, [14] and      several between the Seneca and Cayuga lakes. [15] A number of such      fortifications and burial places have been discovered in Ridgeway,      [16] on the southern shore of lake Ontraio. There is evidence      enough that long bloody wars were waged among the inhabitants. *      * * * * * From the known ferocity of the ancient Scandinavians,      who with other Europeans of ancient times we suppose to be the      authors of the vast works about the region of Onondaga, dreadful      wars with infinite butcheries, must have crimsoned every hill and      dale of this now happy country. [17] * * * * * * In the fourteenth      township; fourth range of the Holland Company's lands in the state      of New York, near the Ridge road leading from Buffalo to Niagara      Falls [18] is an ancient fort, situated in a large swamp; it covers      about five acres of ground; large trees are standing upon it. The      earth which forms this fort was evidently brought from a distance,      as the soil of the marsh is quite another kind, wet and miry, while      the site of the fort is dry gravel and loam. The site of this      fortification is singular, unless we suppose it to have been a last      resort or hiding place from an enemy. The distance to the margin      of the marsh is about half a mile, where large quantities of human      bones have been found, on opening the earth, of an"]]]
