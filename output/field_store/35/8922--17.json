It will thus be seen that while  some microbes are undesirable, others exert a beneficial action.    40. It is only within comparatively recent years that the action of  micro-organisms has been understood. It is now definitely known that  these minute living things seize every possible chance to attack  articles of food and produce the changes known as fermentation,  putrefaction, souring, and decay. Micro-organisms that cause  fermentation are necessary in bread making and vinegar making, but they  are destructive to other foods, as, for example, those which are canned  or preserved. Organisms that cause putrefaction are needed in the making  of sauer kraut, salt rising bread, and cheese. Molds also help to make  cheese, but neither these nor putrefactive organisms are desirable for  foods other than those mentioned. It should be remembered, however, that  even those foods which require micro-organisms in their making are  constantly in danger of the attacks of these small living things, for  unless something is done to retard their growth they will cause food to  sour or decay and thus become unfit for consumption.    Some foods, of course, withstand the attacks of micro-organisms for  longer periods of time than others. For example, most fruits that are  protected by an unbroken skin will, under the right conditions, keep for  long periods of time, but berries, on account of having less protective  covering, spoil much more quickly. Likewise, vegetables without skins  decay faster than those with skins, because they have no protective  covering and contain more water, in which, as is definitely known, most  micro-organisms thrive.    41. If food is to be kept from decaying, the housewife must endeavor to  prevent the growth of micro-organisms, and she can best accomplish this  if she is familiar with the ways in which they work. It is for this  reason that, whether she possesses a scientific knowledge of bacteria or  not, an understanding of some practical facts concerning why food spoils  and how to keep it from decaying is imperative. In this part of cookery,  as in every other phase, it is the reason why things should be done that  makes all that relates to the cooking of food so interesting. In all  parts of the work there are scientific facts underlying the processes,  and the more the housewife learns about these, the more she can exercise  the art of cookery, which, like all other arts, depends on scientific  principles.           *       *       *       *       *    METHODS OF CARE    CLASSIFICATION    42. As has been pointed out, it is not the mere presence of  micro-organisms that causes the spoiling of food, but their constant  growth. Therefore, to keep milk from souring, meat from spoiling, bread  from molding, canned fruit from fermenting, and so on, it is necessary  to know what will prevent the growth of these minute organisms.  Different foods require different treatment. Some foods must be kept  very cold, some must be heated or cooked, others must be dried, and to  others must be added preservatives. An unwarrantable prejudice has been  raised in the minds of many persons against the use of preservatives,  but this is due to the fact that the term is not properly understood. In  this use, it means anything that helps to preserve or keep safe the food  to which it is added. Sugar, salt, spices, and vinegar are all  preservatives, and are added to food as much for the purpose of  preserving it as for seasoning it.      CANNING AND DRYING OF FOODS    43. Among the common methods of caring for foods that are to be used at  a future time are canning and drying. CANNING, which is discussed fully  in another Section, consists in preserving sterile foods in sealed cans  or jars. The aim in canning is to prevent the growth of micro-organisms,  and to do this the process known as _sterilizing_--that is, the  destroying of bacteria and other micro-organisms by means of heat--is  resorted to. Canning theories are different now from what they were in  former times. For example, housewives formerly made heavy, rich  preserves of available fruits because it was thought that sugar must be  used in large quantities in order to keep or prevent them from spoiling.  While it is true that the sugar assisted, science has since proved that  sterilizing is what must be done, so that now only the sugar desired for  sweetening need be used.    44. The other method of keeping food, namely, DRYING, depends for its  success on the fact that such micro-organisms as bacteria cannot grow  unless they have a considerable quantity of moisture or water. Molds  grow on cheese, bread, damp cloth or paper, or articles that contain  only a small amount of moisture, but bacteria need from 20 to 30 per  cent. of water in food in order to grow and multiply. This explains why  in high altitudes and dry climates foods keep for a long time without  artificial means of preservation. It also explains why the old-fashioned  housekeeper dried fruits and why the preservation of certain meats is  accomplished by the combined methods of smoking and drying, the creosote  of the smoke given off from the wood used in this process acting as a  preservative. All the grains, which are very dry, keep for long periods  of time, even centuries, if they are protected from the moisture of the  air. Peas, beans, and lentils, as well as dried biscuits and crackers,  are all examples of how well food will keep when little or no moisture  is present.      KEEPING FOODS WITH ICE    45. Although, as has just been pointed out, moisture is required for the  growth of some micro-organisms, both moisture and warmth are necessary  for the growth of most of the organisms that cause molding,  putrefaction, and fermentation. It is definitely known, also, that in  winter or in cold climates food can be kept for long periods of time  without any apparent change; in fact, the lower the temperature the less  likely are foods to spoil, although freezing renders many of them unfit  for use. These facts are what led up to the scientific truth that  keeping foods dry and at a low temperature is an effective and  convenient method of preventing them from spoiling and to the invention  of the refrigerator and other devices and methods for the cold  storage of foods.    46. THE REFRIGERATOR.--For home use, the refrigerator offers the most  convenient means of keeping foods in good condition. As is well known,  it is a device that, by means of air cooled by the melting of ice or in  some other manner, keeps food at a temperature near the freezing point.  All refrigerators are constructed in a similar manner, having two or  more layers of wood between which is placed an insulating material, such  as cork, asbestos, or mineral wool. The food compartments are lined with  tile, zinc, or other rust-proof material, and the ice compartment is  usually lined with rust-proof metal, so as to be water-tight and  unbreakable. Any refrigerator may be made to serve the purpose of  preserving food effectively if it is well constructed, the ice chamber  kept as full of ice as possible, and the housewife knows how to arrange  the foods in the food chambers to the best advantage.    The construction and use of refrigerators are based on the well-known  scientific fact that air expands and rises when it becomes warm. This  can be proved by testing the air near the ceiling of a room, for no  matter how warm it is near the floor it will always be warmer above. The  same thing occurs in a refrigerator. As air comes in contact with the  ice, it is cooled and falls, and the warm air is forced up. Thus the air  is kept in constant motion, or circulation.    [Illustration: Fig 12.]    47. Many refrigerators are built with the ice compartment on one side,  as in the refrigerator illustrated in Fig. 12. In such refrigerators,  there is usually a small food compartment directly under the ice  chamber, and this is the coldest place in the refrigerator. Here should  be stored the foods that need special care or that absorb odors and  flavors readily, such as milk, butter, cream, meat, etc., because at  this place the air, which circulates in the manner indicated by the  arrow, is the purest. The foods that give off odors strong enough to  taint others should be kept on the upper shelves of the refrigerator,  through which the current of air passes last before being freed from  odors by passing over the ice.    48. In Fig. 13 is shown a type of refrigerator in which the ice chamber,  or compartment, extends across the entire top. This type is so built as  to produce on each side a current of air that passes down from the ice  at the center and back up to the ice near the outside walls, as shown by  the arrows. A different arrangement is required for the food in this  kind of refrigerator, those which give off odors and flavors being  placed in the bottom compartment, or farthest from the ice, and those  which take up odors and flavors, on the top shelf, or nearest the ice. A  careful study of both Figs. 12 and 13 is advised, for they show the best  arrangement of food in each type of refrigerator.    [Illustration: Fig. 13]    49. CARE OF FOOD IN REFRIGERATOR.--The proper placing of foods in a  refrigerator is extremely important, but certain precautions should be  taken with regard to the food itself. Cooked foods should never be  placed in the refrigerator without first allowing them to cool, for the  steam given off when a dish of hot food comes in contact with the cold  air makes the refrigerator damp and causes an undue waste of ice by  warming the air. All dishes containing food should be wiped dry and  carefully covered before they are placed in the refrigerator, so as to  keep unnecessary moisture out of it. As butter and milk are likely to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.

CARAMEL CUSTARD.--Caramel is nothing more nor less than browned  sugar, but if the process of caramelizing the sugar is performed  carefully, the result will be a delicious flavoring material that may be  used for desserts of any kind or for making sauces to serve with  desserts. When the sugar is browned to make caramel, a certain amount of  sweetness is lost, so that more sugar must be used than would ordinarily  be needed to sweeten the same amount of custard.    To make the caramel required in the accompanying recipe, place 1/2  cupful of sugar in a small saucepan over the fire. Allow the sugar to  melt slowly, stirring it as little as possible. When it has completely  melted and no more of it remains white, add 1/2 cupful of boiling water.  Allow this to cook until a heavy sirup is formed. Care must be taken not  to burn the sugar black, for if this is done, the custard, or whatever  is flavored with the caramel, will have a burnt taste. The color should  be a clear reddish-brown. Maple sirup may be used in the same way as  caramel by cooking it until it becomes thick.    CARAMEL CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2-1/2 c. milk  Caramel  3 eggs  Pinch of salt  Few drops of vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, add the caramel to the milk, and then  cool the mixture. Beat the eggs and add them to the caramel and milk.  Add the salt and vanilla. Pour the custard into buttered baking dishes,  set in a pan of warm water, and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Cool  and serve.    26. SOFT CUSTARD.--The custard given in the accompanying recipe is  commonly known as _boiled custard_, but this is in no sense a correct  name, for the custard at no time reaches the boiling point. The common  method of preparation is dry steaming, for which the double boiler is an  essential utensil. If one is not in supply, however, a saucepan placed  in a larger pan of water will serve the purpose. The custard should be  stirred continuously during its cooking. Then it will not set nor  thicken as does baked custard, even though the proportion of eggs and  milk may be higher.    [Illustration: FIG. 2, Testing doneness of soft custard with spoon.]    The test for soft custard, which is exactly opposite from that for baked  custard, is shown in Fig. 2. As soon as the custard mixture lightly  coats a spoon it is done. Then it should be removed from the fire and  the inner part of the double boiler removed from the outer part to avoid  the application of any more heat. If too much heat has been applied or  the custard has been cooked too long, the result will be a curdled mass.  As soon as this is observed, the custard should be removed from the hot  water, placed at once into a pan of cold water, and beaten vigorously  with a rotary egg beater. To improve it further, it may be poured  through a fine wire sieve or strainer. Unless the curding has gone too  far or the egg has been cooked a great deal too long, this treatment  will produce a very decided improvement in the custard and possibly  bring it to a normal condition.    SOFT CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  3 eggs  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/4 tsp. vanilla  1/4 tsp. lemon extract    Heat the milk in the inner pan of a double boiler. Separate the eggs.  Beat the yolks slightly, and to them add the sugar and salt. Dilute with  a little of the hot milk. Blend well together and pour into the hot  milk. Stir constantly until the mixture coats a spoon, and then remove  from the fire. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry, and  fold them into the mixture. Flavor with the vanilla and lemon extract,  cool, and serve.    To obtain variety in soft custards, chocolate, caramel, maple, and other  flavors may be used in their preparation in the same way as for  baked custards.    27. FRENCH CREAM.--A custard dessert that is easily made and that most  persons are fond of is French cream. As will be noted in the  accompanying recipe, only one egg is used and corn starch is supplied  for the remainder of the thickening. It is always necessary to salt  mixtures containing starch, as any starchy food has a raw taste when it  is prepared without salt.    FRENCH CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  1 Tb. corn starch  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1 egg  1/4 tsp. vanilla  1/4 tsp. lemon extract    Heat the milk in a double boiler, reserving a sufficient amount to  moisten the corn starch. Mix the corn starch with the sugar and salt,  moisten with the cold milk, and add to the milk in the double boiler  when it has heated. Stir until the mixture has thickened very slightly.  Cook in the double boiler for 20 or 30 minutes. Beat the egg, add a  small amount of the hot mixture to the beaten egg, and then pour this  into the thickened milk, stirring rapidly to keep the egg from curding.  Cook for a minute or two, remove from the fire, add the flavoring, cool,  and serve.    28. FLOATING ISLAND.--The dessert known as Floating Island does not  differ very much from soft custard. It is slightly thicker and contains  whipped cream, which is used for the island. If whipped cream cannot be  obtained, however, the white of egg may be substituted for it. In such  an event, the white of the egg included in the recipe may be retained  when the custard is made and used on top by sweetening it with sugar or  perhaps by beating into it a small amount of pink jelly.    FLOATING ISLAND  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  1-1/2 Tb. corn starch  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1 egg  1/2 tsp. vanilla  Whipped cream    Heat the milk in a double boiler, retaining enough to moisten the corn  starch. Mix the corn starch, sugar, and salt, and moisten with the cold  milk. Add this to the heated milk in the double boiler, stir until the  mixture has thickened, and then cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Beat the egg,  add to it a spoonful of the hot mixture, and then pour this into the  double boiler, stirring to prevent the curding of the egg. Cook for a  minute or two, or until the egg has had time to thicken, remove from the  heat, and add the vanilla. When cold, serve in individual dishes or  glasses with a spoonful of whipped cream on top of each portion.    29. CORN-STARCH CUSTARD.--A dessert that is a little heavier than either  French cream or Floating Island but not heavy enough to be molded is the  corn-starch custard given in the accompanying recipe. If desired, it may  be served with sauce, plain cream, or whipped cream, or it may be eaten  without any of these.    CORN-STARCH CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  2 Tb. corn starch  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1 egg  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, reserving enough to moisten the corn  starch. Mix the corn starch, sugar, and salt, and moisten with the cold  milk. Add this to the hot milk, and stir until the mixture has  thickened. Cook for 20 or 30 minutes. Beat the egg, add a spoonful of  the hot mixture to the egg, pour this into the double boiler, and cook  for a minute or two, or until the egg has thickened. Remove from the  fire, add the vanilla, cool, and serve.    30. COCONUT-CORN-STARCH CUSTARD.--The flavor of coconut in custard is  agreeable, but the toughness of this ingredient with a soft custard is  not always acceptable. In the preparation of the custard given in the  accompanying recipe, the idea is to obtain the flavor without the use of  the coconut in the custard.    COCONUT-CORN-STARCH CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  2 Tb. corn starch  1/2 c. coconut  1/4 c. sugar  1/8 tsp. salt  1 egg  Vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, retaining enough of it to moisten the  corn starch. Put the coconut into the milk while it is hot, and allow it  to remain for 5 or 10 minutes after the milk has become heated. Then  strain through a ricer or a strainer to remove all the liquid possible,  and return the milk to the double boiler. Mix the sugar and salt with  the corn starch and moisten with the cold milk. Add this to the hot milk  and cook for 20 or 30 minutes after it has thickened. Beat the egg and  add a little of the hot material to it; then pour it into the double  boiler and cook for a minute or two, or until the egg has thickened.  Flavor with a few drops of vanilla, remove from the fire, cool,  and serve.    31. SNOW PUDDING.--An excellent custard dessert called snow pudding can  be made by following the directions here given. This pudding is  especially attractive when served with chocolate sauce, as the sauce  makes an agreeable contrast in color as well as in flavor. Other sauces,  however, may be used with this dessert if desired. The yolks of the eggs  may be made into a custard sauce and served with it, or a fruit sauce  may be used.    SNOW PUDDING  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 pt. milk  2 Tb. corn starch  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  2 egg whites  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, reserving a sufficient amount to  moisten the corn starch. Mix the corn starch, sugar, and salt and  moisten with the cold milk. Add this to the hot milk and stir  continuously until the corn starch thickens the milk. Cook for 20 to 30  minutes and remove from the fire. Beat the egg whites until they are  stiff and fold them into this mixture. Add the vanilla, pour into a  serving dish or individual dishes, cool, and serve with chocolate or any  desired sauce.    32. PLAIN BLANC MANGE.--A blanc mange is usually a mixture thickened to  such an extent with starchy material that it may be turned out of a mold  or cut into cubes. The plain blanc mange given here requires a  well-flavored sauce to relieve its bland taste.    PLAIN BLANC MANGE  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    2 c. milk  1/4 c. corn starch  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, reserving enough to moisten the corn  starch. Mix the corn starch, sugar, and salt and moisten with the cold  milk. Pour "]]]
