Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them      To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]      Thy lips are warm!      Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?      Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!                                        [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]      This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.                    She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].                    Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.        Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.      Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.      Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.                                       [Exeunt some of the Watch.]      Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,      Who here hath lain this two days buried.      Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;      Raise up the Montagues; some others search.                                     [Exeunt others of the Watch.]      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,      But the true ground of all these piteous woes      We cannot without circumstance descry.         Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].      2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.      Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.              Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.      3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.      We took this mattock and this spade from him      As he was coming from this churchyard side.      Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.                  Enter the Prince [and Attendants].        Prince. What misadventure is so early up,      That calls our person from our morning rest?                Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].        Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?      Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'      Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,      With open outcry, toward our monument.      Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?      Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,      Warm and new kill'd.      Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.      Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,      With instruments upon them fit to open      These dead men's tombs.      Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!      This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house      Is empty on the back of Montague,      And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!      Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.                   Enter Montague [and others].        Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up      To see thy son and heir more early down.      Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.      What further woe conspires against mine age?      Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.      Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,      To press before thy father to a grave?      Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,      Till we can clear these ambiguities      And know their spring, their head, their true descent;      And then will I be general of your woes      And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,      And let mischance be slave to patience.      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.      Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,      Yet most suspected, as the time and place      Doth make against me, of this direful murther;      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge      Myself condemned and myself excus'd.      Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.      Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.      I married them; and their stol'n marriage day      Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce      To County Paris. Then comes she to me      And with wild looks bid me devise some mean      To rid her from this second marriage,      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.      Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)      A sleeping potion; which so took effect      As I intended, for it wrought on her      The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo      That he should hither come as this dire night      To help to take her from her borrowed grave,      Being the time the potion's force should cease.      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone      At the prefixed hour of her waking      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.      But when I came, some minute ere the time      Of her awaking, here untimely lay      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth      And bear this work of heaven with patience;      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.      All this I know, and to the marriage      Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life      Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,      Unto the rigour of severest law.      Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.      Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?      Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;      And then in post he came from Mantua      To this same place, to this same monument.      This letter he early bid me give his father,      And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,      If I departed not and left him there.      Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.      Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?      Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;      And by-and-by my master drew on him;      And then I ran away to call the watch.      Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,      Their course of love, the tidings of her death;      And here he writes that he did buy a poison      Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.      Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,      See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!      And I, for winking at you, discords too,      Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.      Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more      Can I demand.      Mon. But I can give thee more;      For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,      That whiles Verona by that name is known,      There shall no figure at such rate be set      As that of true and faithful Juliet.      Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!      Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.      The sun for sorrow will not show his head.      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;      For never was a story of more woe      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.                                                     Exeunt omnes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11123"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 01 (#16)"],[1,";    There grows it ever,    There blooms it yet.      HATEM[25] (1815)      Locks of brown, still bind your captive    In the circle of her face!    I, beloved sinuous tresses,    Naught possess that's worth your grace--      But a heart whose love enduring    Swells in youthful fervor yet:    Snow and mists envelop Etna,    Making men the fire forget.      Yonder mountain's pride so stately    Thou dost shame like dawn's red glow;    And its spell once more bids Hatem    Thrill of spring and summer know.      Once more fill the glass, the flagon!    Let me drink to my desire.    If she find a heap of ashes,    Say, \"He perished in her fire!\"      REUNION[26] (1815)      Can it be, O star transcendent,    That I fold thee to my breast?    Now I know, what depths of anguish    May in parting be expressed.    Yes, 'tis thou, of all my blisses    Lovely, loving partner--thou!    Mindful of my bygone sorrows,    E'en the present awes me now.      When the world in first conception    Lay in God's eternal mind,    In creative power delighting    He the primal hour designed.    When he gave command for being,    Then was heard a mighty sigh    Full of pain, as all creation    Broke into reality.      Up then sprang the light; and darkness    Doubtful stood apart to gaze;    All the elements, dividing    Swiftly, took their several ways.    In confused, disordered dreaming    Strove they all for freedom's range--    Each for self, no fellow-feeling;    Single each, and cold and strange.      Lo, a marvel--God was lonely!    All was still and cold and dumb.    So he framed dawn's rosy blushes    Whence should consolation come--    To refresh the troubled spirit    Harmonies of color sweet:    What had erst been forced asunder    Now at last could love and meet.      Then, ah then, of life unbounded    Sight and feeling passed the gates;    Then, ah then, with eager striving    Kindred atoms sought their mates.    Gently, roughly they may seize them,    So they catch and hold them fast:    \"We,\" they cry, \"are now creators--    Allah now may rest at last!\"      So with rosy wings of morning    Towards thy lips my being moves;    Sets the starry night a thousand    Glowing seals upon our loves.    We are as we should be--parted    Ne'er on earth in joy or pain;    And no second word creative    E'er can sunder us again!      PROOEMION[27] (1816)      In His blest name, who was His own creation,    Who from all time makes _making_ His vocation;    The name of Him who makes our faith so bright,    Love, confidence, activity, and might;    In that One's name, who, named though oft He be,    Unknown is ever in Reality:    As far as ear can reach, or eyesight dim,    Thou findest but the known resembling Him;    How high soe'er thy fiery spirit hovers,    Its simile and type it straight discovers;    Onward thou'rt drawn, with feelings light and gay,    Where e'er thou goest, smiling is the way;    No more thou numberest, reckonest no time,    Each step is infinite, each step sublime.    What God would _outwardly_ alone control,    And on His finger whirl the mighty Whole?    He loves the _inner_ world to move, to view    Nature in Him, Himself in Nature, too,    So that what in Him works, and is, and lives,    The measure of His strength, His spirit gives.    Within us all a universe doth dwell;    And hence each people's usage laudable,    That every one the Best that meets his eyes    As God, yea, e'en _his_ God, doth recognize;    To Him both earth and heaven surrenders he,    Fears Him, and loves Him, too, if that may be.      THE ONE AND THE ALL[28] (1821)      Called to a new employ in boundless space,    The lonely monad quits its 'customed place    And from life's weary round contented flees.    No more of passionate striving, will perverse    And hampering obligations, long a curse:    Free self-abandonment at last gives peace.      Soul of the world, come pierce our being through!    Across the drift of things our way to hew    Is our appointed task, our noblest war.    Good spirits by our destined pathway still    Lead gently on, best masters of our will,    Toward that which made and makes all things that are.    To shape for further ends what now has breath,    Let nothing harden into ice and death,    Works endless living action everywhere.    What has not yet existed strives for birth--    Toward purer suns, more glorious-colored earth:    To rest in idle stillness naught may dare.    All must move onward, help transform the mass,    Assume a form, to yet another pass;    'Tis but in seeming aught is fixed or still.    In all things moves the eternal restless Thought;    For all, when comes the hour, must fall to naught    If to persist in being is its will.      LINES ON SEEING SCHILLER'S SKULL[30] (1826)    [This curious imitation of the ternary metre of Dante was written at  the age of seventy-seven.]      Within a gloomy charnel-house one day    I viewed the countless skulls, so strangely mated,    And of old times I thought that now were gray.    Close packed they stand that once so fiercely hated,    And hardy bones that to the death contended,    Are lying crossed,--to lie forever, fated.    What held those crooked shoulder-blades suspended?    No one now asks; and limbs with vigor fired,    The hand, the foot--their use in life is ended.    Vainly ye sought the tomb for rest when tired;    Peace in the grave may not be yours; ye're driven    Back into daylight by a force inspired;    But none can love the withered husk, though even    A glorious noble kernel it contained.      To me, an adept, was the writing given    Which not to all its holy sense explained.    When 'mid the crowd, their icy shadows flinging,    I saw a form that glorious still remained,    And even there, where mould and damp were clinging,    Gave me a blest, a rapture-fraught emotion,    As though from death a living fount were springing.    What mystic joy I felt! What rapt devotion!    That form, how pregnant with a godlike trace!    A look, how did it whirl me toward that ocean    Whose rolling billows mightier shapes embrace!    Mysterious vessel! Oracle how dear!    Even to grasp thee is my hand too base,    Except to steal thee from thy prison here    With pious purpose, and devoutly go    Back to the air, free thoughts, and sunlight clear.    What greater gain in life can man e'er know    Than when God-Nature will to him explain    How into Spirit steadfastness may flow,    How steadfast, too, the Spirit-Born remain.      A LEGACY[31] (1829)      No living atom comes at last to naught!    Active in each is still the eternal Thought:    Hold fast to Being if thou wouldst be blest.    Being is without end; for changeless laws    Bind that from which the All its glory draws    Of living treasures endlessly possessed.      Unto the wise of old this truth was known,    Such wisdom knit their noble souls in one;    Then hold thou still the lore of ancient days!    To that high power thou ow'st it, son of man,    By whose decree the earth its circuit ran    And all the planets went their various ways.    Then inward turn at once thy searching eyes;      Thence shalt thou see the central truth arise    From which no lofty soul goes e'er astray;    There shalt thou miss no needful guiding sign--    For conscience lives, and still its light divine    Shall be the sun of all thy moral day.    Next shalt thou trust thy senses' evidence,    And fear from them no treacherous offence    While the mind's watchful eye thy road commands:    With lively pleasure contemplate the scene    And roam securely, teachable, serene,    At will throughout a world of fruitful lands.    Enjoy in moderation all life gives:    Where it rejoices in each thing that lives    Let reason be thy guide and make thee see.    Then shall the distant past be present still,    The future, ere it comes, thy vision fill--    Each single moment touch eternity.    Then at the last shalt thou achieve thy quest,    And in one final, firm conviction rest:    What bears for thee true fruit alone is true.    Prove all things, watch the movement of the world    As down the various ways its tribes are whirled;    Take thou thy stand among the chosen few.    Thus hath it been of old; in solitude    The artist shaped what thing to him seemed good,    The wise man hearkened to his own soul's voice.    Thus also shalt thou find thy greatest bliss;    To lead where the elect shall follow--this    And this alone is worth a hero's choice.        INTRODUCTION TO HERMANN AND DOROTHEA    Hermann and Dorothea is universally known and prized in Germany as no  other work of the classical period of German literature except  Goethe's _Faust_ and Schiller's _Wilhelm Tell_, and, although  distinctively German in subject and spirit, it early became and is  still a precious possession of all the modern world. It marks the  culmination of the renaissance in the literary art of Germany and  perhaps of Europe.    Schiller hailed it as the pinnacle of Goethe's and of all modern art.  A. W. Schlegel in 1797 judged it to be a finished work of art in the  grand style, and at the same time intelligible, sympathetic,  patriotic, popular, a book full of golden teachings of wisdom and  virtue. Two generations later one of the leading historians of German  literature declared that there is no other poem that comes so near to  the father of all poetry (Homer) as this, none in which Greek form and  German content are so intimately blended, and that this is perhaps the  only poem which without explanation and without embarrassment all the  modern centuries could offer to an ancient Greek to enjoy. In the view  of the end of the nineteenth century, expressed by a distinguished  philosopher-critic, this work is a unique amalgam of the artistic  spirit, objectivity, and contemplative clearness of Homer with the  soul-life of the present, the heart-beat of the German people, the  characteristic traits which mark "]]]
