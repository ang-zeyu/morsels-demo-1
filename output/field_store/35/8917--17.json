[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#15)"],[1," his Jewish training the  slightest appreciation of the spiritual power of Judaism or of the  divine purpose illustrating itself in the rise and fall of nations. His  conception of history is a biography of might, tempered by occasional  manifestations of divine retribution. The concrete event is the  important thing, and of culture and literature he says scarcely a word.  His occasional moral reflections are on a mediocre plane and not true to  the finer spirit of Judaism. He is consciously or unconsciously obsessed  by the power of Rome, and makes little attempt to inculcate the higher  moral outlook of his people. In soul, too, he is Romanized. He admires  above all material power; he exhibits material conceptions of  Providence; he looks always for material causes. Altogether the  _Antiquities_ is a work invaluable for its material, but a somewhat  soulless book.    Josephus conveys more of the spirit of Judaism in his two books commonly  entitled _Against Apion_, which are professedly apologetic. They were  written after the _Antiquities_, and further emphasize two points on  which he had dwelt in that work: the great age of the Jewish people and  the excellence of the Jewish law. He was anxious to refute those  detractors who, despite the publication of his history, still continued  to spread grotesquely false accounts of Israel's origin and Israel's  religious teachings; and he wrote here with more spirit and with more  conviction than in his earlier elaborate works. He has no longer to  accommodate himself to the vanity of a Roman Emperor, or to distort  events so as to glorify his nation or to excuse his own conduct. He is  able for once to set out his idea wholeheartedly, and he shows that, if  he had few of the qualities required for a great historian, he had  several of the talents of an apologist. His own calculated  misrepresentation of his people in their last struggle would have  afforded an opponent the best reply to his apology. In itself that  apology was an effective summary of Judaism for his own times, and parts  of it have a permanent value. For seventeen centuries it remained the  sole direct answer from the Jewish side to the calumnies of the enemies  of the Jews.    The last extant work of Josephus was the _Life_, of which we have  already treated, and it were better to say little more. It was provoked  by the publication of the History of Justus, which had accused Josephus  and the Galileans of having been the authors of the sedition against the  Romans.[1] Josephus retorts that, before he was appointed governor,  Justus and the people of Tiberias had attacked the Greek cities of the  Decapolis and the dominions of Agrippa, as was witnessed in the  Commentaries of Vespasian. Not content with this crime, Justus had  failed to surrender to the Romans till they appeared before Tiberias.  Having charged his rival with being a better patriot than himself,[2]  Josephus proceeds to argue that he was a worse historian: Justus could  not describe the Galilean campaign, because during the war he was at  Berytus; he took no part in the siege of Jerusalem, and, less privileged  than his rival, he had not read the Commentaries of Caesar, and in fact  often contradicted them. Conscious of this weakness, he had not ventured  to publish his account till the chief actors in the story, Vespasian,  Titus, and Agrippa, had died, though his books had been written some  twenty years before they were issued. But in his pains to gainsay Justus  and his own patriotism, such as it was, Josephus, as has been noticed,  gives an account of his doings in Galilee that is often at complete  variance with his statements in the _Wars_. The _Life_, in fact, is  untrustworthy history and unsuccessful apology.    [Footnote 1: Vita, 65.]    [Footnote 2: Justus, no doubt, had done the converse, representing  himself as a thorough Romanizer and Josephus as an ardent rebel.]    At the end of the _Antiquities_ Josephus declares his intention to write  three books concerning the Jewish doctrines \"about God and His essence,  and concerning the laws, why some things are permitted, and others are  prohibited.\" In the preface to the same work, as well as in various  passages in its course, he refers to his intention to write on the  philosophical meaning of the Mosaic legislation. The books entitled  _Against Apion_ correspond neither in number nor in content to this  plan, and we must therefore assume that he never carried it out. He may  have intended to abstract the commentary of Philo upon the Law, which he  had doubtless come to know. Certainly he shows no traces of deeper  allegorical lore in the extant works, and his mind was hardly given to  such speculations. But a humanitarian and universalistic explanation of  the Mosaic code, such as his predecessor had composed, notably in his  Life of Moses, would have been quite in his way, and would have rounded  off his presentation of the past and present history of the Jews. The  need of replying to his personal enemies and the detractors of his  nation deterred him perhaps from achieving this part of his scheme. Or,  if it was written, the Christian scribes, who preserved his other works,  may have suppressed it because it did not harmonize with their ideas.    Photius ascribes to Josephus a work on _The Universe_, or _The Cause of  the Universe_ ([Greek: peri taes tou pantos aitias]), which is extant,  but which is demonstrably of Christian origin, and was probably written  by Hippolytus, an ecclesiastical writer of the third century and the  author of _Philosophumena_. Another work attributed to Josephus in the  Dark and Middle Ages, and often attached to manuscripts of the  _Antiquities_, is the sermon on _The Sovereignty of Reason_, which is  commonly known as the Fourth Book of the Maccabees. The book is a  remarkable example of the use of Greek philosophical ideas to confirm  the Jewish religion. That the Mosaic law is the rule of written reason  is the main theme, and it is illustrated by the story of the martyrs  during the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, whence the book takes its  title. In particular, the author points to the ethical significance  underlying the dietary laws, of which he says in a remarkable passage:    When we long for fishes and fowls and fourfooted animals and every kind  of food that is forbidden to us by the Law, it is through the mastery of  pious reason that we abstain from them. For the affections and appetites  are restrained and turned into another direction by the sobriety of the  mind, and all the movements of the body are kept in check by pious  reason.    Again, of the Law as a whole he says:    It teaches us temperance, so that we master our pleasures and desires,  and it exercises us in fortitude, so that we willingly undergo every  toil. And it instructs us in justice, so that in all our behavior we  give what is due, and it teaches us to be pious, so that we worship the  only living God in the manner becoming His greatness.    Freudenthal has conclusively disposed of the theory that Josephus was  the author of this work.[1] Neither in language, nor in style, nor in  thought, has it a resemblance to his authentic works. Nor was he the man  to write anonymously. It reveals, indeed, a mastery of the arts of Greek  rhetoric, such as the Palestinian soldier who learnt Greek only late in  life, and who required the help of friends to correct his syntax, could  never have acquired. It reveals, too, a knowledge of the technical terms  of the Stoic philosophy and a general grasp of Greek philosophy quite  beyond the writer of the _Antiquities_ and the _Wars_. Lastly, it  breathes a wholehearted love for Judaism and a national ardor to which  the double-dealing defender of Galilee and the client of the Roman court  could hardly have aspired.    [Footnote 1: Freudenthal, Die Flavius Josephus beigelegte Schrift ueber  die Herrschaft der Vernunft, 1879.]    The genuine works of Josephus reveal him not as a philosopher or sturdy  preacher of Judaism, but as an apologetic historian and apologist,  distinguished in either field rather for his industry and his ingenuity  in using others' works than by any original excellence. He learnt from  the Greeks and Romans the external manner of systematic history, and in  this he stood above his Jewish predecessors. He learnt from them also  the arts of mixing false with true, of invention, of exaggeration, of  the suggestion of the bad and the suppression of the good motive. He was  a sophist rather than a sage, and circumstances compelled him to be a  court chronicler rather than a national historian. And while he acquired  something of the art of historical writing from his models, he lost the  intuitive synthesis of the Jewish attitude, which saw the working of  God's moral law in all human affairs. On the other hand, certain defects  of his history may be ascribed to lack of training and to the spirit of  the age. He had scant notion of accuracy, he made no independent  research into past events, and he was unconscionable in chronology. In  his larger works he is for the most part a translator and compiler of  the work of others, but he has some claim to originality of design and  independence of mind in the books against Apion. The times were out of  joint for a writer of his caliber. For the greater part of his literary  life, perhaps for the whole, he was not free to write what he thought  and felt, and he wrote for an alien public, which could not rise to an  understanding of the deeper ideas of his people's history. But this much  at least may be put down to his credit, that he lived to atone for the  misrepresentation of the heroic struggle of the Jews with the Romans by  preserving some record of many dark pages in their history and by  refuting the calumnies of the Hellenistic vituperators about their  origin and their religious teachings.

Murmur soft nothings to the women; flirt but don't have  favourites. Don't be too political with the men: work in plenty of  anecdotes about your swell relations.\"    I replied that I could confidently promise geniality, except if  seasick: but Sir Marcus implored me at all costs not to be seasick.  That was the one thing I must not be. My whole time between the Piraeus  and Alexandria, on board the _Candace,_ must be spent ingratiating  myself with the sulky passengers, and obliterating from their memories  the crimes of Colonel Corkran. In Sir Marcus' opinion my future charges  had taken passage on the _Candace,_ and would go up the Nile, not to  see sights, but to be seen doing the right things. According to him not  two out of twenty cared tuppence for Egypt, but wished to talk about it  in sparkling style at home. My friend Captain Fenton and I must make it  sparkle. Sir Marcus had resigned himself to the fact that one of his  trump cards--Anthony--could not be produced until the arrival in Cairo  of the troupe, and that even then, the name of Fenton must not be used  as an attraction. Lark felt confident that I was a good enough card to  make his hand worth playing, and in spite of the half contemptuous  amusement with which I regarded the whole scheme, I couldn't help being  \"on my mettle.\" I found myself wanting to succeed, wanting to please  the big, common man whom a few hours ago I had been cursing.    I had to start for Greece the night after our decision. Meanwhile, I  was anxious to explain the unexplainable to Brigit and Monny, and  secure the party for Sir Marcus Lark's alleged dahabeah, which turned  out to be one of Cook's old boats bought and newly decorated. Both my  tasks would be difficult. I had to hide the secret reason for selling  myself to the financier, and at the same time keep the respect of the  ladies. As for inducing Miss Gilder to give up her dream of a private  dahabeah, I foresaw that it would be like persuading the youngest  lioness in the Cairo Zoo to surrender her cherished wooden ball. But I  began by giving Monny a present; a fine old turban-box of rare, red  tortoise shell inlaid with mother of pearl, which I found at an  antiquary's. In the silklined box reposed a green turban; and that  green turban told its own story. Miss Gilder flushed with pleasure at  sight of it. \"I've won my bet!\" she exclaimed.    \"Yes,\" said I. \"To my astonishment! The man consents. He's a great  prize, knows Cairo and upper Egypt like a book. But you'll have to  surrender him when you go on the Nile.\"    In her haste to know why, Monny forgot to ask how I had obtained the  green turban; and for this I was glad, because it was only the second  best headgear of my smart friend the Hadji. In explaining that the  distinguished Egyptian had been engaged by Sir Marcus Lark, I slipped  in a word about my own part in the trip, describing it as an ideal  rest-cure for a budding diplomat on sick leave. I praised the boat and  spoke of the fun on board. I regretted Miss Gilder's preference for a  private dahabeah, so obvious, so millionairy! Still, I added, every one  to his taste! And anyhow, no doubt all the best cabins on the  _Enchantress Isis_ were taken.    That was the entering wedge--the mention of an obstacle to overcome.  Miss Gilder looked thoughtful, though she kept silence: and next day,  when making my adieux before starting for Alexandria, she flung out a  careless question. When would the _Enchantress Isis_ leave Cairo? How  many passengers would she carry? Would there be a rush at the Temples,  or would there be plenty of time for proper sightseeing? And was I sure  that all the nicest cabins were engaged? No, I was not sure. I could  inquire. I tried not to look triumphant, but I must have darted out a  ray, because Monny withdrew into her shell. She had inquired out of  curiosity, she explained. I had told such stories about the  _Enchantress Isis_ that she would like to see her. Perhaps Antoun  Effendi could get permission for a visit to the boat.    In this state I had to leave affairs, and start for the Piraeus, where  I must await the return of the tourists from Athens. I had two days at  sea in which to work up an agony of apprehension, and I could have  thanked heaven when, arriving on board the big white yacht, I found  that I was ahead of the passengers. I was expected, however, and a deck  cabin was ready for my occupation. I hoped that I had not turned out my  rival from the room, but dared not question the steward. He seemed to  know all about me, nevertheless, and said that my name had been \"posted  up\" as conductor of the Nile party. \"If I may take the liberty of  mentioning it, my lord,\" he added, \"it has made a very good  impression.\" We were to steam for Alexandria the moment the passengers  arrived in the special train--having had three days of sightseeing in  Athens--and I had just got my possessions stowed away when a wave of  chattering voices broke over the ship. My heart gave a jump, as a  soldier's must when called to fight on an empty stomach at dawn on a  winter's morning. What ought I to do? How was I to make the  acquaintance of my future charges? Must it be en masse, or could it be  done singly? I had neglected to ask Sir Marcus what would be expected  of me, and I was in a worse funk than a new boy on his first day at  school. Soon it would be dinner time. I wished that I were ill, but I  remembered that the one thing I must not do was to be seasick. Already  the ship was beginning to move out of the Greek harbour, or I should  have been tempted to get a telegram calling me home. Even the Mountain  of the Golden Pyramid seemed not too great a sacrifice to make--but it  was too late to make it--and some one was knocking at my door.    I opened it with such courage as I had; and the instant I set eyes on  the man I knew that he was Colonel Corkran. He was born to be a retired  colonel. What came before the retiring could have been but a prelude. A  stout figure of middle height; red face, veined on cheeks and nose;  pale blue eyes which looked as if they had faded in the wash; purple  moustache and eyebrows; close-cropped gray hair; a double chin  clamouring for extra collar space; and a bridge-player's expression.  This was the rival whose place I had virtually, though not officially,  usurped.    I was prepared to hear him hiss \"Viper!\" between his teeth, as  characters in melodramatic serials do to perfection, their front teeth  having doubtless been designed for such purposes. But his look seemed  to denote pity rather than hatred. So might a prison-warder regard a  condemned man, in coming to announce the hour of execution.    \"Lord Ernest Borrow?\" said he, in a slightly hoarse voice. \"I'm Colonel  Corkran. Delighted to meet you. I've met your brother, Lord Killeena.  Daresay he wouldn't remember me. I don't think I can begin better than  by thanking you for coming to take over my job.\"    \"Oh, I haven't done that!\" I hastened to protest, as he sat fatly down  in a chair I pushed forward. \"As I understand, I'm to take a few people  off your hands, and the hands of your assistant, Mr. Kruger, so that  you can go to Palestine instead of leaving that important excursion  entirely to the chaplain, Mr. Watts.\"    Colonel Corkran laughed. \"Thank you for trying to save my feelings,\"  said he. \"But I assure you they're not hurt. I'm sincerely delighted to  see you--for my own sake. For yours--well, that's another pair of  shoes! My dear fellow, I wonder if you've the smallest idea what you're  in for?\"    \"In for?\" I echoed.    \"Yes. I'm saying this as a friend. Don't think I'm jealous. Lord, no! I  look on you as a deliverer. And don't think I want to frighten you. It  isn't that. But I feel it's my duty to prepare you. I might have got on  better if there'd been some one to do the same by me. There wasn't.  Kruger, my so-called assistant, is a spy. At best, he's a mere  accountant, not supposed to look after the passengers socially. I  gather that he was some secretary of Lark's. Beware of him. He writes  to Lark from every port. As for the passengers, the saintly lot are bad  enough. Yet it's only the food and the cabins and the attendance _they_  grumble about. I'm shunted off the worldly lot onto them in future. But  at their worst, they'll be a rest-cure! and Lark has the decency not to  reduce my screw. It's the worldly lot that's going to make you curse  the day you were born.\"    He wanted me to speak, or groan; but I maintained a stricken silence,  to which I gave some illusion of dignity. After a disappointed pause he  went on: \"You'd better know something about these people. Beasts, every  one of 'em, young or old, some beastly common beasts, but all beastly  rich, except those that are beastly poor, and on the make--to marry  their daughters, or cadge for smart friends. Lark was bidding for  swells, and got snobs. Thinks his silly title will carry weight in  society as it does in the city. 'Lark Pie,' we're called, I hear. I  call us a 'Pretty Kettle of Fish!' The girls are the worst of the  caboodle, though some of 'em aren't bad looking. You won't believe the  trouble I've had with the creatures till you begin to get the same  yourself.\"    \"What kind of trouble?\" I inquired gingerly.    \"Every kind a woman can make. Apart from food troubles, they think  they're not being entertained enough on board; think I ought to get up  more dances; tango teas I suppose! Don't like the way I organize games;  are mad because they can't have music at meals--which they can't  because the band's all stewards; blame me because the men don't make  love to them, or because they do. And at the hotels where we go on  shore, it's Hades. Naturally the people staying in the hotels resent  us. They look on us as a menagerie--a rabble. So we are. At least, they  are. I don't count myself in with them. What can I do? I'm not  omnipotent. "]]]
