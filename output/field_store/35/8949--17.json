First, in  January, 1772; secondly, in February, 1772; and thirdly, in May, 1772.  And that no decision otherwise than what the law warranted might be  given, the opinion of the judges was taken upon the pleadings. The great  and glorious result of the trial was, \"That as soon as ever any slave  set his foot upon English territory, he became free.\"    Thus ended the great case of Somerset, which, having, been determined  after so deliberate an investigation of the law, can never be reversed  while the British Constitution remains. The eloquence displayed in it by  those who were engaged on the side of liberty, was perhaps never  exceeded on any occasion; and the names of the counsellors Davy, Glynn,  Hargrave, Mansfield, and Alleyne, ought always to be remembered with  gratitude by the friends of this great cause. For when we consider in  how many crowded courts they pleaded, and the number of individuals in  these, whose minds they enlightened, and whose hearts they interested in  the subject, they are certainly to be put down as no small instruments  in the promotion of it; but chiefly to him, under Divine Providence, are  we to give the praise, who became the first great actor in it, who  devoted his time, his talents, and his substance to this Christian  undertaking, and by whose laborious researches the very pleaders  themselves were instructed and benefited. By means of his almost  incessant vigilance and attention, and unwearied efforts, the poor  African ceased to be hunted in our streets as a beast of prey. Miserable  as the roof might be, under which he slept, he slept in security. He  walked by the side of the stately ship, and he feared no dungeon in her  hold. Nor ought we, as Englishmen, to be less grateful to this  distinguished individual than the African ought to be upon this  occasion. To him we owe it, that we no longer see our public papers  polluted by hateful advertisements of the sale of the human species, or  that we are no longer distressed by the perusal of impious rewards for  bringing back the poor and the helpless into slavery, or that we are  prohibited the disgusting spectacle of seeing man bought by his  fellow-man. To him, in short, we owe this restoration of the beauty of  our constitution--this prevention of the continuance of our national  disgrace.    I shall say but little more of Mr. Sharp at present, than that he felt  it his duty, immediately after the trial, to write to Lord North, then  principal minister of state, warning him in the most earnest manner, to  abolish immediately both the trade and the slavery of the human species  in all the British dominions, as utterly irreconcileable with the  principles of the British constitution, and the established religion of  the land.    Among other coadjutors, whom the cruel and wicked practices which have  now been so amply detailed brought forward, was a worthy clergyman,  whose name I have not yet been able to learn. He endeavoured to interest  the public feeling in behalf of the injured Africans, by writing an  epilogue to the _Padlock_, in which Mungo appeared as a black servant.  This epilogue is so appropriate to the case, that I cannot but give it  to the reader. Mungo enters, and thus addresses the audience:--        Thank you, my massas! have you laugh your fill?    Then let me speak, nor take that freedom ill.    E'en from _my_ tongue some heart-felt truths may fall,    And outraged Nature claims the care of all.    My tale in _any_ place would force a tear,    But calls for stronger, deeper feelings here;    For whilst I tread the free-born British land,    Whilst now before me crowded Britons stand,--    Vain, vain that glorious privilege to me,    I am a slave, where all things else are free.      Yet was I born, as you are, no man's slave,    An heir to all that liberal Nature gave;    My mind can reason, and my limbs can move    The same as yours; like yours my heart can love;    Alike my body food and sleep sustain;    And e'en like yours--feels pleasure, want, and pain.    One sun rolls o'er us, common skies surround;    One globe supports us, and one grave must bound.      Why then am I devoid of all to live    That manly comforts to a man can give?      To live--untaught religion's soothing balm,    Or life's choice arts; to live--unknown the calm,    Of soft domestic ease; those sweets of life,    The duteous offspring, and th' endearing wife?    To live--to property and rights unknown,    Not e'en the common benefits my own!    No arm to guard me from Oppression's rod,    My will subservient to a tyrant's nod!    No gentle hand, when life is in decay,    To soothe my pains, and charm my cares away;    But helpless left to quit the horrid stage,    Harassed in youth, and desolate in age!      But I was born in Afric's tawny strand,    And you in fair Britannia's fairer land;    Comes freedom, then, from colour?--Blush with shame!    And let strong Nature's crimson mark your blame.    I speak to Britons.--Britons--then behold    A man by, Britons _snared_, and _seized_, and _sold!_    And yet no British statute damns the deed,    Nor do the more than murderous villains bleed.      O sons of Freedom! equalize your laws,    Be all consistent, plead the negro's cause;    That all the nations in your code may see    The British negro, like the Briton, free.    But, should he supplicate your laws in vain,    To break, for ever, this disgraceful chain,    At least, let gentle usage so abate    The galling terrors of its passing state,    That he may share kind Heaven's all social plan;    For, though no Briton, Mungo is--a man.    I may now add, that few theatrical pieces had a greater run than the  _Padlock_; and that this epilogue, which was attached to it soon after  it came out, procured a good deal of feeling for the unfortunate  sufferers, whose cause it was intended to serve.    Another coadjutor, to whom these cruel and wicked practices gave birth,  was Thomas Day, the celebrated author of _Sandford and Merton_, and  whose virtues were well known among those who had the happiness of his  friendship. In the year 1773 he published a poem, which he wrote  expressly in behalf of the oppressed Africans. He gave it the name of  _The Dying Negro._ The preface to it was written in an able manner by  his friend Counsellor Bicknell, who is therefore to be ranked among the  coadjutors in this great cause. The poem was founded on a simple fact,  which had taken place a year or two before. A poor negro had been seized  in London, and forcibly put on board a ship, where he destroyed himself,  rather than return to the land of slavery. To the poem is affixed a  frontispiece, in which the negro is represented. He is made to stand in  an attitude of the most earnest address to heaven, in the course of  which, with the fatal dagger in his hand, he breaks forth in the  following words:      To you this unpolluted blood I pour,    To you that spirit, which ye gave, restore.      This poem, which was the first ever written expressly on the subject,  was read extensively; and it added to the sympathy in favour of  suffering humanity, which was now beginning to show itself in the  kingdom.    About this time the first edition of the _Essay an Truth_ made its  appearance in the world. Dr. Beattie took an opportunity, in this work,  of vindicating the intellectual powers of the Africans from the  aspersions of Hume, and of condemning their slavery as a barbarous piece  of policy, and as inconsistent with the free and generous spirit of the  British nation.    In the year 1774, John Wesley, the celebrated divine, to whose pious  labours the religious world will long be indebted, undertook the cause  of the poor Africans. He had been in America, and had seen and pitied  their hard condition. The work which he gave to the world in  consequence, was entitled _Thoughts on Slavery_. Mr. Wesley had this  great cause much at heart, and frequently recommended it to the support  of those who attended his useful ministry.    In the year 1776, the Abbe Proyart brought out, at Paris, his _History  of Loango_, and other kingdoms in Africa, in which he did ample justice  to the moral and intellectual character of the natives there.    The same year produced two new friends in England, in the same cause,  but in a line in which no one had yet moved. David Hartley, then a  member of parliament for Hull, and the son of Dr. Hartley who wrote the  _Essay on Man_, found it impossible any longer to pass over without  notice the case of the oppressed Africans. He had long felt for their  wretched condition, and, availing himself of his legislative situation,  he made a motion in the House of Commons, \"That the Slave Trade was  contrary to the laws of God, and the rights of men.\" In order that he  might interest the members as much as possible in his motion, he had  previously obtained some of the chains in use in this cruel traffic, and  had laid them upon the table of the House of Commons. His motion was  seconded by that great patriot and philanthropist, Sir George Saville.  But though I am now to state that it failed, I cannot but consider it as  a matter of pleasing reflection, that this great subject was first  introduced into parliament by those who were worthy of it; by those who  had clean hands and an irreproachable character, and to whom no motive  of party or faction could be imputed, but only such as must have arisen  from a love of justice, a true feeling of humanity, and a proper sense  of religion.    About this time two others, men of great talents and learning, promoted  the cause of the injured Africans, by the manner in which they  introduced them to notice in their respective works.    Dr. Adam Smith, in his _Theory of Moral Sentiments_, had, so early as  the year 1759, held them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"ly. It appears, by a deed of agreement,[19] that the work was printed  at the author's expense; that he was to sell the bookseller one hundred  copies for sixty livres (about 5_l_. 12_s_.) on condition of the book's  not being sold at the rate of more than sixteen sous (1_s_. 8_d_.); that  the author was not to give, sell, or allow to be sold, any copy of the  book at Ferrara, except by the bookseller; that the bookseller, after  disposing of the hundred copies, was to have as many more as he chose on  the same terms; and that, on his failing to require a further supply,  Ariosto was to be at liberty to sell his volumes to whom he pleased.  \"With such profits,\" observes Panizzi, \"it was not likely that the poet  would soon become independent;\" and it may be added, that he certainly  got nothing by the first edition, whatever he may have done by the  second. He expressly tells us, in the satire which he wrote on declining  to go abroad with Ippolito, that all his poetry had not procured him  money enough to purchase a cloak.[20] Twenty years afterwards, when he  was dead, the poem was in such request, that, between 1542 and 1551,  Panizzi calculates there must have been a sale of it in Europe to the  amount of a hundred thousand copies.[21]    The second edition of the _Furioso_ did not extricate the author from  very serious difficulties; for the next year he was compelled to apply  to either to relieve him from his necessities, or permit him to look for  some employment more profitable than the ducal service. The answer of  this prince, who was now rich, but had always been penurious, and who  never laid out a farthing, if he could help it, except in defence of his  capital, was an appointment of Ariosto to the government of a district in  a state of anarchy, called Garfagnana, which had nominally returned to  his rule in consequence of the death of Leo, who had wrested it from him.  It was a wild spot in the Apennines, on the borders of the Ferrarese and  papal territories. Ariosto was there three years, and is said to have  reduced it to order; but, according to his own account, he had very  doubtful work of it. The place was overrun with banditti, including the  troops commissioned to suppress them. It required a severer governor than  he was inclined to be; and Alfonso did not attend to his requisitions for  supplies. The candid and good-natured poet intimates that the duke might  have given him the appointment rather for the governor's sake than the  people's; and the cold, the loneliness and barrenness of the place, and,  above all, his absence from the object of his affections, oppressed him.  He did not write a verse for twelve months: he says he felt like a bird  moulting[22]. The best thing got out of it was an anecdote for posterity.  The poet was riding out one day with a few attendants--some say walking  out in a fit of absence of mind--when he found himself in the midst of  a band of outlaws, who, in a suspicious manner, barely suffered him  to pass. A reader of Mrs. Radcliffe might suppose them a band of  _condottieri_, under the command of some profligate desperado; and such  perhaps they were. The governor had scarcely gone by, when the leader of  the band, discovering who he was, came riding back with much earnestness,  and making his obeisance to the poet, said, that he never should have  allowed him to pass in that manner had he known him to be the Signor  Ludovico Ariosto, author of the _Orlando Furioso_; that his own name was  Filippo Pacchione (a celebrated personage of his order); and that his men  and himself, so far from doing the Signor displeasure, would have the  honour of conducting him back to his castle. \"And so they did,\" says  Baretti, \"entertaining him all along the way with the various excellences  they had discerned in his poem, and bestowing upon it the most rapturous  praises[23].\"    On his return from Garfagnana, Ariosto is understood to have made several  journeys in Italy, either with or without the duke his master; some of  them to Mantua, where it has been said that he was crowned with laurel by  the Emperor Charles the Fifth. But the truth seems to be, that he only  received a laureate diploma: it does not appear that Charles made him any  other gift. His majesty, and the whole house of Este, and the pope, and  all the other Italian princes, left that to be done by the imperial  general, the celebrated Alfonso Davallos, Marquess of Vasto, to whom he  was sent on some mission by the Duke of Ferrara, and who settled on him  an annuity of a hundred golden ducats; \"the only reward,\" says Panizzi,  \"which we find to have been conferred on Ariosto expressly as a  poet.\"[24] Davallos was one of the conquerors of Francis the First,  young and handsome, and himself a writer of verses. The grateful poet  accordingly availed himself of his benefactor's accomplishments to make  him, in turn, a present of every virtue under the sun. Caesar was not so  liberal, Nestor so wise, Achilles so potent, Nireus so beautiful, nor  even Ladas, Alexander's messenger, so swift.[25] Ariosto was now verging  towards the grave; and he probably saw in the hundred ducats a golden  sunset of his cares.    Meantime, however, the poet had built a house, which, although small, was  raised with his own money; so that the second edition of the _Orlando_  may have realised some profits at last. He recorded the pleasant fact in  an inscription over the door, which has become celebrated:      \"Parva, sed apta mihi; sed nulli obnoxia; sed non      Sordida; parta meo sed tamen acre domus.\"    Small, yet it suits me; is of no offence;    Was built, not meanly, at my own expense.    What a pity (to compare great things with small) that he had not as long  a life before him to enjoy it, as Gil Blas had with his own comfortable  quotation over his retreat at Lirias![26]    The house still remains; but the inscription unfortunately became  effaced; though the following one remains, which was added by his son  Virginio:                     \"Sic domus haec Areostea    Propitios habeat deos, olim ut Pindarica.\"      Dear to the gods, whatever come to pass,    Be Ariosto's house, as Pindar's was.    This was an anticipation--perhaps the origin--of Milton's sonnet about  his own house, addressed to \"Captains and Collonels,\" during the civil  war.[27]    Davallos made the poet his generous present in the October of the year  1513; and in the same month of the year following the _Orlando_ was  published as it now stands, with various insertions throughout, chiefly  stories, and six additional cantos. Cardinal Ippolito had been dead some  time; and the device of the beehive was exchanged for one of two vipers,  with a hand and pair of shears cutting out their tongues, and the motto,  \"Thou hast preferred ill-will to good\" (_Dilexisti malitiam super  benignitatem_). The allusion is understood to have been to certain  critics whose names have all perished, unless Sperone (of whom we shall  hear more by and by) was one of them. The appearance of this edition was  eagerly looked for; but the trouble of correcting the press, and the  destruction of a theatre by fire which had been built under the poet's  direction, did his health no good in its rapidly declining condition; and  after suffering greatly from an obstruction, he died, much attenuated, on  the sixth day of June, 1533. His decease, his fond biographers have  told us, took place \"about three in the afternoon;\" and he was \"aged  fifty-eight years, eight months, and twenty-eight days.\" His body,  according to his direction, was taken to the church of the Benedictines  during the night by four men, with only two tapers, and in the most  private and simple manner. The monks followed it to the grave out of  respect, contrary to their usual custom.    So lived, and so died, and so desired humbly to be buried, one of the  delights of the world.    His son Virginio had erected a chapel in the garden of the house built by  his father, and he wished to have his body removed thither; but the  monks would not allow it. The tomb, at first a very humble one, was  subsequently altered and enriched several times; but remains, I  believe, as rebuilt at the beginning of the century before last by his  grand-nephew, Ludovico Ariosto, with a bust of the poet, and two statues  representing Poetry and Glory.    Ariosto was tall and stout, with a dark complexion, bright black eyes,  black and curling hair, aquiline nose, and shoulders broad but a little  stooping. His aspect was thoughtful, and his gestures deliberate. Titian,  besides painting his portrait, designed that which appeared in the  woodcut of the author's own third edition of his poem, which has been  copied into Mr. Panizzi's. It has all the look of truth of that great  artist's vital hand; but, though there is an expression of the, genial  character of the mouth, notwithstanding the exuberance of beard, it does  not suggest the sweetness observable in one of the medals of Ariosto,  a wax impression of which is now before me; nor has the nose so much  delicacy and grace.[28]    The poet's temperament inclined him to melancholy, but his intercourse  was always cheerful. One biographer says he was strong and  healthy--another, that he was neither. In all probability he was  naturally strong, but weakened by a life full of emotion. He talks of  growing old at forty four, and of leaving been bald for some time.[29] He  had a cough for many years before he died. His son says he cured it by  drinking good old wine. Ariosto says that \"vin fumoso\" did not agree with  him; but that might only mean wine of a heady sort. The chances, under  such circumstances, were probably against wine of any kind; and Panizzi  thinks the cough was never subdued. His physicians forbade him all sorts  of stimulants with his food.[30]    His temper and habits were those of a man wholly given up to love and  poetry. In his youth he was volatile, and "]]]
