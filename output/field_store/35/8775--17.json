Accordingly the little company turned their eyes  away, and regarded each other instead.    \"Well, so Dick rolled off?\" proceeded the old gentleman.    \"Oh! no, he didn't,\" said all three boys together; \"he stuck fast to  the double ripper; we ran into a tree, and Dick was pitched off  head-first.\"    \"But honestly and truly, father,\" said Jasper, \"I do not think that it  was the fault of the steerer.\"    \"Indeed it was not,\" declared Ben stoutly; \"there was an ugly little  gully that we hadn't seen under the snow. We'd been down four or five  times all right, but only missed it by a hair-breadth; this time the  ripper struck into it; I suppose Dick felt it bump, as it was on his  side, and sang out, and as quick as lightning we were against that  tree. It was as much my fault as any one's, and more, because I ought  to have known that old hill thoroughly.\"    \"I share the blame, Ben,\" broke in Jasper, \"old fellow, if you pitch  into yourself, you'll have to knock me over too.\"    \"Come here, Vanny,\" said old Mr. King, holding out his hand. \"Why, you  needn't be afraid, my boy,\" aghast at the tears that no power on earth  could keep back. \"Now all leave the room, please.\"    \"Where's Polly?\" asked Ben, on the other side of the door.    \"She's run home,\" said David, \"I guess. She isn't here.\"    \"And that's where I must be too,\" cried Ben, bounding off.    When Van was next seen he was with old Mr. King, and wearing all signs  of having received his full share of comfort. Phronsie, just tying on  her little hood, to go down to the parsonage to ask after Dicky, looked  out of the window to exclaim in pleased surprise, \"Why, here comes dear  Grandpapa,\" and then she rushed out to meet him.    \"Here's my little girl,\" cried the old gentleman, opening his arms,  when she immediately ran into them. \"Now we're all right.\"    \"Is Dicky all right?\" asked Phronsie anxiously, as she fell into step  by his side.    \"Yes, indeed; as well as a youngster can be, who's broken his leg.\"    Phronsie shivered. \"But then, that's nothing,\" Mr. King hastened to  add; \"I broke my own when I was a small shaver no bigger than Dick, and  I was none the worse for it. Boys always have some such trifling  mishaps, Phronsie.\"    \"Ben never broke his leg, nor Joel, nor Davie,\" said Phronsie. \"Must  they yet, Grandpapa?\"    \"O dear, no,\" declared Mr. King hastily; \"that isn't necessary. I only  meant they must have something. Now you see, Ben had the measles, you  know.\"    \"Yes, he did,\" said Phronsie, quite relieved to think that this trial  could take the place of the usual leg-breaking episode in a boy's  career. \"And so did Joel, and Davie--all of them, Grandpapa dear.\"    \"Exactly; well, and then Ben had to work hard, and Joel and Davie too,  for that matter. So, you see, it wasn't as essential that they should  break their legs, child.\"    \"But Jasper and Percy and Van don't have to work hard; oh! I don't want  them to break their legs,\" said Phronsie, in a worried tone. \"You don't  think they will, Grandpapa dear, do you? Please say they won't.\"    \"I don't think there is the least danger of it,\" said Mr. King,  \"especially as I shall put an end to this double-ripper business,  though not because this upset was anybody's fault; remember that,  Phronsie.\" Van's head which had dropped a bit at the last words, came  up proudly. \"Van, here, has acted nobly\"--he put his hand on the boy's  shoulder--\"and would have saved Dicky if he could. It was a pure  accident that nobody could help except by keeping off from the  abominable thing. Well, here we are at the little brown house; and  there's your mother, Phronsie, waiting for us in the doorway.\"    \"Halloo!\" cried Van, rushing over the flat stone, and past Mrs. Pepper,  \"where's Joel? Oh--here, you old chap!\"    \"Well, Mrs. Pepper,\" said the old gentleman, coming up to the step,  Phronsie hanging to his hand, \"this looks like starting for town  to-morrow, doesn't it?\"    \"Oh! what shall we do, sir?\" cried Mrs. Pepper, in distress. \"To think  you have come down here in the goodness of your heart, to be met with  such an accident as this. What shall we do?\" she repeated.    \"Goodness of my heart,\" repeated Mr. King, nevertheless well pleased at  the tribute. \"I've had as much pleasure out of it all as you or the  young people. I want you to realize that.\"    \"So does any one who does a kind act,\" replied Mrs. Pepper, wiping her  eyes; \"well, sir, now how shall we manage about going back?\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. King slowly, and he took a long  look at the winter sky, and the distant landscape before he ventured  more. \"It very much looks as if we all should remain for a few days, to  see how Dick is to get on, all but the four boys; they must pack off to  school to-morrow, and then probably Mrs. Whitney will stay over with  the boy till he can be moved. Dr. Fisher will do the right thing by  him. Oh! everything is all right, Mrs. Pepper.\"    Mrs. Pepper sighed and led the way into the house. She knew in spite of  the reassuring words that the extreme limit of the \"outing\" ought to be  passed on the morrow.          X    THE PARTY SEPARATES      \"Good-by to the little brown house!\" Joel and David, Percy and Van sang  out in doleful chorus, from the old stage coach; two of the boys on the  seat shared by John Tisbett, the other two within as companions to Mrs.  Pepper and Jasper, who were going home to start the quartette off to  school.    \"Ben and I will take good care of everything, Mamsie,\" said Polly for  the fiftieth time, and climbing up on the steps to tuck the traveling  shawl closer. Thereupon Phronsie climbed up too, to do the same thing.  \"Don't you worry; we'll take care of things,\" she echoed.    \"I shan't worry,\" said Mrs. Pepper in a bright assured way. \"Mother  knows you'll both do just right. And Phronsie'll be a good girl too,\"  with a long look into the bright eyes peering over the window casing of  the old coach.    \"I'll try,\" said Phronsie. \"Good-by, Mamsie,\" and she tried to stand on  tiptoe to reach her mouth up.    \"Goodness me!\" cried Polly, \"you nearly tumbled off the steps. Throw  her a kiss, Phronsie; Mamsie'll catch it.\"    \"If that child wants to kiss her ma agen, she shall do it,\" declared  Mr. Tisbett; and throwing down the reins, he sprang to the ground,  seized Phronsie, and swung her lightly over the window edge. \"There you  be--went through just like a bird.\" And there she was, sure enough, in  Mrs. Pepper's lap.    \"I should like to go with you,\" Phronsie was whispering under Mrs.  Pepper's bonnet strings, \"Mamsie, I should.\"    \"Oh, no, Phronsie!\" Mrs. Pepper made haste to whisper back. \"You must  stay with Polly. Why, what would she ever do without you? Be mother's  good girl, Phronsie; you're all coming home, except Auntie and Dick, in  a few days.\"    Phronsie cast one look at Polly. \"Good-by,\" she said slowly. \"Take me  out now,\" holding her arms towards Mr. Tisbett.    \"Here you be!\" exclaimed Mr. Tisbett merrily, reversing the process,  and setting her carefully on the ground. \"Now, says I; up I goes,\" his  foot on the wheel to spring to the box.    \"Stay!\" a peremptory hand was laid on his shaggy coat sleeve, and he  turned to face old Mr. King.    \"When I meet a man who can do such a kind thing, it is worth my while  to say that I trust no words of mine gave offense. Bless you, man!\"  added the old gentleman, abruptly changing the tone of his address as  well as its form, \"it's my way; that's all.\"    John Tisbett had no words to offer, but remained, his foot on the  wheel, stupidly staring up at the handsome old face.    \"We shall be late for the train,\" called Jasper within the coach, \"if  you don't start.\"    \"Get up, do!\" cried Joel, who had seized the reins, \"or I'll drive off  without you, Mr. Tisbett,\" which had the effect to carry honest John  briskly up to his place. When there, he took off his fur cap without a  word, and bowed to Mr. King, cracked his whip and they were off,  leaving the four on the little foot-path gazing after them, till the  coach was only a speck in the distance.    \"Mamma dear,\" said Dick, one afternoon three weeks later (the little  brown house had been closed a fortnight, and all the rest of the party  back in town), \"when are we going home?\"    \"Next week,\" said Mrs. Whitney brightly; \"the doctor thinks if all goes  well, you can be moved from here.\"    Dick leaned back in the big chintz-covered chair. \"Mamma,\" he said,  \"your cheeks aren't so pink, and not quite so round, but I think you  are a great deal nicer mamma than you were.\"    \"Do you, Dick?\" she said, laughing. \"Well, we have had a happy time  together, haven't we? The fortnight hasn't been so long for you as I  feared when the others all went away.\"    \"It hasn't been long at all,\" said Dick promptly, and burrowing deeper  into the chair-back; \"it's just flown, mamma. I like Polly and  Phronsie; but I'd rather have you than any girl I know; I had really,  mamma.\"    \"I'm very glad to hear it, Dick,\" said Mrs. Whitney, with another laugh.    \"And when I grow up, I'm just going to live with you forever and ever.  Do you suppose papa will be always going to Europe then?\"    \"I trust not,\" said Mrs. Whitney fervently. \"Dicky, would you like to  have a secret?\" she asked suddenly.    The boy's eyes sparkled. \"Wouldn't I mamma?\" he cried, springing  forward in the chair; \"ugh!\"    \"Take care, darling,\" warned his mother. \"You must remember the poor  leg.\"    Dick made a grimace, but otherwise took the pain pluckily. \"Tell me,  do, mamma,\" he begged, \"the secret.\"    \"Yes, I thought it would be a pleasant thing for you to have it to  think of, darling, while you are getting well. Dicky, papa is coming  home soon.\"    \"Right away?\" shouted Dick so lustily that Mrs. Henderson popped her  head in the door. \"Oh! beg your pardon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#15)"],[1," he called [Greek word omitted], curious to  learne things, and those were his darlings, the other he termed  [Greek word omitted], who respected nothing more than the language.\"  Yet can no man say, but that to speake well, is most gracious and  commendable, but not so excellent as some make it: and I am grieved  to see how we imploy most part of our time about that onely. I would  first know mine owne tongue perfectly, then my neighbours with whom  I have most commerce. I must needs acknowledge, that the Greeke and  Latine tongues are great ornaments in a gentleman, but they are  purchased at over-high a rate. Use it who list, I will tell you how  they may be gotten better, cheaper, and much sooner than is  ordinarily used, which was tried in myselfe. My late father, having,  by all the meanes and industrie that is possible for a man, sought  amongst the wisest, and men of best understanding, to find a most  exquisite and readie way of teaching, being advised of the  inconveniences then in use; was given to understand that the  lingring while, and best part of our youth, that we imploy in  learning the tongues, which cost them nothing, is the onely cause we  can never attaine to that absolute perfection of skill and knowledge  of the Greekes and Romanes. I doe not beleeve that to be the onely  cause. But so it is, the expedient my father found out was this;  that being yet at nurse, and before the first loosing of my tongue,  I was delivered to a Germane (who died since, a most excellent  Physitian in France) he being then altogether ignorant of the French  tongue, but exquisitely readie and skilfull in the Latine. This man,  whom my father had sent for of purpose, and to whom he gave verie  great entertainment, had me continually in his armes, and was mine  onely overseer. There were also joyned unto him two of his  countrimen, but not so learned; whose charge was to attend, and now  and then to play with me; and all these together did never  entertaine me with other than the Latine tongue. As for others of  his household, it was an inviolable rule, that neither himselfe, nor  my mother, nor man, nor maid-servant, were suffered to speake one  word in my companie, except such Latine words as every one had  learned to chat and prattle with me. It were strange to tell how  every one in the house profited therein. My Father and my Mother  learned so much Latine, that for a need they could understand it,  when they heard it spoken, even so did all the household servants,  namely such as were neerest and most about me. To be short, we were  all so Latinized, that the townes round about us had their share of  it; insomuch as even at this day, many Latine names both of workmen  and of their tooles are yet in use amongst them. And as for myselfe,  I was about six years old, and could understand no more French or  Perigordine than Arabike; and that without art, without bookes,  rules, or grammer, without whipping or whining, I had gotten as pure  a Latin tongue as my Master could speake; the rather because I could  neither mingle or confound the same with other tongues. If for an  Essay they would give me a Theme, whereas the fashion in Colleges  is, to give it in French, I had it in bad Latine, to reduce the same  into good. And Nicholas Grouchy, who hath written De comitiis  Romanorum, William Guerente, who hath commented Aristotele: George  Buchanan, that famous Scottish Poet, and Marke Antonie Muret, whom  (while he lived) both France and Italie to this day, acknowledge to  have been the best orator: all which have beene my familiar tutors,  have often told me, that in mine infancie I had the Latine tongue so  readie and so perfect, that themselves feared to take me in hand.  And Buchanan, who afterward I saw attending on the Marshall of  Brissacke, told me, he was about to write a treatise of the  institution of children, and that he tooke the model and patterne  from mine: for at that time he had the charge and bringing up of the  young Earle of Brissack, whom since we have scene prove so worthy  and so valiant a Captaine. As for the Greeke, wherein I have but  small understanding, my father purposed to make me learne it by art;  But by new and uncustomed meanes, that is, by way of recreation and  exercise. We did tosse our declinations and conjugations to and fro,  as they doe, who by way of a certaine game at tables learne both  Arithmetike and Geometrie. For, amongst other things he had  especially beene persuaded to make me taste and apprehend the fruits  of dutie and science by an unforced kinde of will, and of mine owne  choice; and without any compulsion or rigor to bring me up in all  mildnesse and libertie: yea with such kinde of superstition, that,  whereas some are of opinion that suddenly to awaken young children,  and as it were by violence to startle and fright them out of their  dead sleepe in a morning (wherein they are more heavie and deeper  plunged than we) doth greatly trouble and distemper their braines,  he would every morning cause me to be awakened by the sound of some  instrument; and I was never without a servant who to that purpose  attended upon me. This example may serve to judge of the rest; as  also to commend the judgement and tender affection of so carefull  and loving a father: who is not to be blamed, though hee reaped not  the fruits answerable to his exquisite toyle and painefull manuring.  [Footnote: Cultivation.] Two things hindered the same; first the  barrennesse and unfit soyle: for howbeit I were of a sound and  strong constitution, and of a tractable and yeelding condition, yet  was I so heavie, so sluggish, and so dull, that I could not be  rouzed (yea were it to goe to play) from out mine idle drowzinesse.  What I saw, I saw it perfectly; and under this heavy, and as it were  Lethe-complexion did I breed hardie imaginations, and opinions farre  above my yeares. My spirit was very slow, and would goe no further  than it was led by others; my apprehension blockish, my invention  poore; and besides, I had a marvelous defect in my weake memorie: it  is therefore no wonder, if my father could never bring me to any  perfection. Secondly, as those that in some dangerous sicknesse,  moved with a kind of hope-full and greedie desire of perfect health  againe, give eare to every Leach or Emperike, [Footnote: Doctor or  quack.] and follow all counsels, the good man being exceedingly  fearefull to commit any oversight, in a matter he tooke so to heart,  suffered himselfe at last to be led away by the common opinion,  which like unto the Cranes, followeth ever those that go before, and  yeelded to customer having those no longer about him, that had given  him his first directions, and which they had brought out of Italie.  Being but six yeares old I was sent to the College of Guienne, then  most flourishing and reputed the best in France, where it is  impossible to adde any thing to the great care he had, both to chuse  the best and most sufficient masters that could be found, to reade  unto me, as also for all other circumstances partaining to my  education; wherein contrary to usuall customes of Colleges, he  observed many particular rules. But so it is, it was ever a College.  My Latin tongue was forthwith corrupted, whereof by reason of  discontinuance, I afterward lost all manner of use: which new kind  of institution stood me in no other stead, but that at my first  admittance it made me to overskip some of the lower formes, and to  be placed in the highest. For at thirteene yeares of age, that I  left the College, I had read over the whole course of Philosophie  (as they call it) but with so small profit, that I can now make no  account of it. The first taste or feeling I had of bookes, was of  the pleasure I tooke in reading the fables of Ovids Metamorphosies;  for, being but seven or eight yeares old, I would steale and  sequester my selfe from all other delights, only to reade them:  Forsomuch as the tongue wherein they were written was to me  naturall; and it was the easiest booke I knew, and by reason of the  matter therein contained most agreeing with my young age. For of  King Arthur, of Lancelot du Lake, of Amadis, of Huon of Burdeaux,  and such idle time consuming and wit-besotting trash of bookes  wherein youth doth commonly ammuse it selfe, I was not so much as  acquainted with their names, and to this day know not their bodies,  nor what they containe: So exact was my discipline. Whereby I became  more carelesse to studie my other prescript lessons. And well did it  fall out for my purpose, that I had to deale with a very discreet  Master, who out of his judgement could with such dexterite winke at  and second my untowardlinesse, and such other faults that were in  me. For by that meanes I read over Virgils AEneados, Terence,  Plautus, and other Italian Comedies, allured thereunto by the  pleasantnesse of their severall subjects: Had he beene so foolishly-  severe, or so severely froward as to crosse this course of mine, I  thinke verily I had never brought any thing from the College, but  the hate and contempt of Bookes, as doth the greatest part of our  Nobilitie. Such was his discretion, and so warily did he behave  himselfe, that he saw and would not see: hee would foster and  increase my longing: suffering me but by stealth and by snatches to  glut my selfe with those Bookes, holding ever a gentle hand over me,  concerning other regular studies. For, the chiefest thing my father  required at their hands (unto whose charge he had committed me) was  a kinde of well conditioned mildnesse and facilitie of complexion.  [Footnote: Easiness of disposition.] And, to say truth, mine had no  other fault, but a certaine dull languishing and heavie  slothfullnesse. The danger was not, I should doe ill, but that I  should doe nothing.    No man did ever suspect I would prove a bad, but an unprofitable  man: foreseeing in me rather a kind of idlenesse than a"]]]
