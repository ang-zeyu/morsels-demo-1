The tank had actually burst her way through the solid wall of the old  factory, permission to complete the demolition of which Tom had secured  from the owners. Then the great machine kept right on. She fairly  \"walked\" over the piles of masonry, dipped down into what had been a  basement, now partly filled with debris, and kept on toward another  wall.    \"I'm going through that, too!\" cried Tom.    And he did, knocking it down and sending his tank over the piled-up  ruins, while the machine guns barked, coughed and spluttered, as Ned  and the others inside the tank held back the firing levers.    Right through the opposite wall, as through the one she had already  demolished, the tank careened on her way, to emerge, rather battered  and dust-covered, on the other side of what was left of the factory.  And there was not much of it left. Tank A had well-nigh completed its  demolition.    \"If there'd been a nest of Germans in there,\" said Tom, as he brought  the machine to a stop in a field beyond the factory, \"they'd have  gotten out in a hurry.\"    \"Or taken the consequences,\" added Ned, as he wiped the sweat from his  powder-blackened and oil-smeared face. \"I certainly kept my gun going.\"    \"Yes, and so did the others,\" reported one of the mechanics, as he  emerged from the \"cubby hole,\" where the great motors had now ceased  their hum and roar.    \"How'd she stand it?\" asked Tom.    \"All right inside,\" answered the man. \"I was wondering how she looks  from the outside.\"    \"Oh, it would take more than that to damage her,\" said Tom, with  pardonable pride. \"That was pie for her! Solid concrete, which she may  have to chew up on the Western front, may present another kind of  problem, but I guess she'll be able to master that too. Well, let's  have a look.\"    He and Ned, with some of the crew and gunners, went outside the tank.  She was a sorry-looking sight, very different from the trim appearance  she had presented when she first left the shop. Bricks, bits of stone,  and piles of broken cement in chunks and dust lay thick on her broad  back. But no real damage had been done, as a hasty examination showed.    \"Well, are you satisfied, Tom?\" asked his chum.    \"Yes, and more,\" was the answer. \"Of course this wasn't the hardest  test to which she could have been submitted, but it will do to show  what punishment she can stand. Being shot at from big guns is another  matter. I'll have to wait until she gets to Flanders to see what effect  that will have. But I know the kind of armor skin she has, and that  doesn't worry me. There's one thing more I want to do while I have her  out now.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Ned.    \"Take her for a long trip cross country, and then shove her through  some extra heavy barbed wire. I'm certain she'll chew that up, but I  want to see it actually done. So now, if you want to come along, Ned,  we'll go cross country.\"    \"I'm with you!\"    \"Get inside then. We'll let the dust and masonry blow and rattle off as  we go along.\"    The tank started off across the fields, which stretched for many miles  on either side of the deserted factory, when suddenly Ned, who was  again at his post in the observation tower, called:    \"Look, Tom!\"    \"What at?\"    \"That corner of the factory which is still standing. Look at those men  coming out and running away!\"    Ned pointed, and his chum, leaning over from the steering wheel and  controls, gave a start of surprise as he saw three figures clambering  down over the broken debris and making their way out of what had once  been a doorway.    \"Did they come out of the factory, Ned?\"    \"They surely did! And unless I miss my guess they were in it, or around  it, when we went through like a fellow carrying the football over the  line for a touchdown.\"    \"In there when the tank broke open things?\"    \"I think so. I didn't see them before, but they certainly ran out as we  started away.\"    \"This has got to be looked into!\" decided Tom. \"Come on, Ned! It may be  more of that spy business!\"    Tom Swift stopped the tank and prepared to get out.          Chapter XVI    The Old Barn      \"There's no use chasing after 'em, Tom,\" observed Ned, as the two chums  stood side by side outside the tank and gazed after the three men  running off across the fields as fast as they could go. \"They've got  too much a start of us.\"    \"I guess you're right, Ned,\" agreed Tom. \"And we can't very well pursue  them in the tank. She goes a bit faster than anything of her build, but  a running man is more than a match for her in a short distance. If I  had the Hawk here, there'd be a different story to tell.\"    \"Well, seeing that you haven't,\" replied Ned, \"suppose we let them  go--which we'll have to, whether we want to or not--and see where they  were hiding and if they left any traces behind.\"    \"That's a good idea,\" returned Tom.    The place whence the men had emerged was a portion of the old factory  farthest removed from the walls the tank had crunched its way through.  Consequently, that part was the least damaged.    Tom and Ned came to what seemed to have been the office of the building  when the factory was in operation. A door, from which most of the glass  had been broken, hung on one hinge, and, pushing this open, the two  chums found themselves in a room that bore evidences of having been the  bookkeeper's department. There were the remains of cabinet files, and a  broken letter press, while in one corner stood a safe.    \"Maybe they were cracking that,\" said Ned.    \"They were wasting their time if they were,\" observed Tom, \"for the  combination is broken--any one can open it,\" and he demonstrated this  by swinging back one of the heavy doors.    A quantity of papers fell out, or what had been papers, for they were  now torn and the edges charred, as if by some recent fire.    \"They were burning these!\" cried Ned. \"You can smell the smoke yet.  They came here to destroy some papers, and we surprised them!\"    \"I believe you're right,\" agreed Tom. \"The ashes are still warm.\" And  he tested them with his hand. \"They wanted to destroy something, and  when they found we were here they clapped the blazing stuff into the  safe, thinking it would burn there.    \"But the closing of the doors cut off the supply of air and the fire  smouldered and went out. It burned enough so that it didn't leave us  very much in the way of evidence, though,\" went on Tom ruefully, as he  poked among the charred scraps.    \"Maybe you can read some of 'em,\" suggested Ned.    \"Part of the writing is in German,\" Tom said, as he looked over the  mass.  \"I don't believe it would be worth while to try it.  Still, I  can save it.  Here, I'll sweep the stuff into a box, and if we get a  chance we can try to patch it together,\" and finding a broken box in  what had been the factory office the young inventor managed to get into  it the charred remains of the papers.    A further search failed to reveal anything that would be useful in the  way of evidence to determine what object the three men could have had  in hiding in the ruins, and Tom and Ned returned to the tank.    \"What do you think about them, Tom?\" asked Ned, as they were about to  start off once more for the cross-country test.    \"Well, it seems like a silly thing to say--as if I imagined my tank was  all there was in this part of the country to make trouble--but I  believe those men had some connection with Simpson and with that spy  Schwen!\"    \"I agree with you!\" exclaimed Ned. \"And I think if we could get head or  tail of those burned papers we'd find that there was some  correspondence there between the man I saw up the tree and the workman  you had arrested.\"    \"Too bad we weren't a bit quicker,\" commented Tom. \"They must have been  in the factory when we charged it--probably came there to be in  seclusion while they talked, plotted and planned. They must have been  afraid to go out when the tank was walking through the walls.\"    \"I guess that's it,\" agreed Ned. \"Did you recognize any of the men,  Tom?\"    \"No, I didn't see 'em as soon as you did, and when they were running  they had their backs toward me. Was Simpson one?\"    \"I can't be sure. If one was, I guess he'll think we are keeping pretty  closely after him, and he may give this part of the country a wide  berth.\"    \"I hope he does,\" returned Tom. \"Do you know, Ned, I have an idea that  these fellows--Schwen Simpson, and those back of them, including  Blakeson--are trying to get hold of the secret of my tank for the  Germans.\"    \"I shouldn't be surprised. But you've got it finished now, haven't you?  They can't get your patents away from you.\"    \"No, it isn't that,\" said Tom. \"There are certain secrets about the  mechanism of the tank--the way I've increased the speed and power, the  use of the spanners, and things like that--which would be useful for  the Germans to know. I wouldn't want them to find out these secrets,  and they could do that if they were in the tank a while, or had her in  their possession.\"    \"They couldn't do that, Tom--get possession of her--could they?\"    \"There's no telling. I'm going to be doubly on the watch.  That fellow  Blakeson is in the pay of the plotters, I believe. He has a big machine  shop, and he might try to duplicate my tank if he knew how she was made  inside.\"    \"I see! That's why he was inquiring about a good machinist, I suppose,  though he'll be mightily surprised when he learns it was you he was  talking to the time your Hawk met with the little mishap.\"    \"Yes, I guess maybe he will be a bit startled,\" agreed Tom. \"But I  haven't seen him around lately, and maybe he has given up.\"    \"Don't trust to that!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#15)"],[1," flash fire; and good fire, too; good  enough to set fire to a fence!\"    \"That is true,\" declared Scraps; \"I saw it done myself. But your  ferocious growl isn't as loud as the tick of a beetle--or one of Ojo's  snores when he's fast asleep.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said the Woozy, humbly, \"I have been mistaken about my  growl. It has always sounded very fearful to me, but that may have been  because it was so close to my ears.\"    \"Never mind,\" Ojo said soothingly; \"it is a great talent to be able to  flash fire from your eyes. No one else can do that.\"    As they stood hesitating what to do Chiss stirred and suddenly a shower  of quills came flying toward them, almost filling the air, they were so  many. Scraps realized in an instant that they had gone too near to  Chiss for safety, so she sprang in front of Ojo and shielded him from  the darts, which stuck their points into her own body until she  resembled one of those targets they shoot arrows at in archery games.  The Shaggy Man dropped flat on his face to avoid the shower, but one  quill struck him in the leg and went far in. As for the Glass Cat, the  quills rattled off her body without making even a scratch, and the skin  of the Woozy was so thick and tough that he was not hurt at all.    When the attack was over they all ran to the Shaggy Man, who was  moaning and groaning, and Scraps promptly pulled the quill out of his  leg. Then up he jumped and ran over to Chiss, putting his foot on the  monster's neck and holding it a prisoner. The body of the great  porcupine was now as smooth as leather, except for the holes where the  quills had been, for it had shot every single quill in that one wicked  shower.    \"Let me go!\" it shouted angrily. \"How dare you put your foot on Chiss?\"    \"I'm going to do worse than that, old boy,\" replied the Shaggy Man.  \"You have annoyed travelers on this road long enough, and now I shall  put an end to you.\"    \"You can't!\" returned Chiss. \"Nothing can kill me, as you know  perfectly well.\"    \"Perhaps that is true,\" said the Shaggy Man in a tone of  disappointment. \"Seems to me I've been told before that you can't be  killed. But if I let you go, what will you do?\"    \"Pick up my quills again,\" said Chiss in a sulky voice.    \"And then shoot them at more travelers? No; that won't do. You must  promise me to stop throwing quills at people.\"    \"I won't promise anything of the sort,\" declared Chiss.    \"Why not?\"    \"Because it is my nature to throw quills, and every animal must do what  Nature intends it to do. It isn't fair for you to blame me. If it were  wrong for me to throw quills, then I wouldn't be made with quills to  throw. The proper thing for you to do is to keep out of my way.\"    \"Why, there's some sense in that argument,\" admitted the Shaggy Man,  thoughtfully; \"but people who are strangers, and don't know you are  here, won't be able to keep out of your way.\"    \"Tell you what,\" said Scraps, who was trying to pull the quills out of  her own body, \"let's gather up all the quills and take them away with  us; then old Chiss won't have any left to throw at people.\"    \"Ah, that's a clever idea. You and Ojo must gather up the quills while  I hold Chiss a prisoner; for, if I let him go, he will get some of his  quills and be able to throw them again.\"    So Scraps and Ojo picked up all the quills and tied them in a bundle so  they might easily be carried. After this the Shaggy Man released Chiss  and let him go, knowing that he was harmless to injure anyone.    \"It's the meanest trick I ever heard of,\" muttered the porcupine  gloomily. \"How would you like it, Shaggy Man, if I took all your shags  away from you?\"    \"If I threw my shags and hurt people, you would be welcome to capture  them,\" was the reply.    Then they walked on and left Chiss standing in the road sullen and  disconsolate. The Shaggy Man limped as he walked, for his wound still  hurt him, and Scraps was much annoyed because the quills had left a  number of small holes in her patches.    When they came to a flat stone by the roadside the Shaggy Man sat down  to rest, and then Ojo opened his basket and took out the bundle of  charms the Crooked Magician had given him.    \"I am Ojo the Unlucky,\" he said, \"or we would never have met that  dreadful porcupine. But I will see if I can find anything among these  charms which will cure your leg.\"    Soon he discovered that one of the charms was labelled: \"For flesh  wounds,\" and this the boy separated from the others. It was only a bit  of dried root, taken from some unknown shrub, but the boy rubbed it  upon the wound made by the quill and in a few moments the place was  healed entirely and the Shaggy Man's leg was as good as ever.    \"Rub it on the holes in my patches,\" suggested Scraps, and Ojo tried  it, but without any effect.    \"The charm you need is a needle and thread,\" said the Shaggy Man. \"But  do not worry, my dear; those holes do not look badly, at all.\"    \"They'll let in the air, and I don't want people to think I'm airy, or  that I've been stuck up,\" said the Patchwork Girl.    \"You were certainly stuck up until we pulled out those quills,\"  observed Ojo, with a laugh.    So now they went on again and coming presently to a pond of muddy water  they tied a heavy stone to the bundle of quills and sunk it to the  bottom of the pond, to avoid carrying it farther.          Chapter Thirteen    Scraps and the Scarecrow      From here on the country improved and the desert places began to give  way to fertile spots; still no houses were yet to be seen near the  road. There were some hills, with valleys between them, and on reaching  the top of one of these hills the travelers found before them a high  wall, running to the right and the left as far as their eyes could  reach. Immediately in front of them, where the wall crossed the  roadway, stood a gate having stout iron bars that extended from top to  bottom. They found, on coming nearer, that this gate was locked with a  great padlock, rusty through lack of use.    \"Well,\" said Scraps, \"I guess we'll stop here.\"    \"It's a good guess,\" replied Ojo. \"Our way is barred by this great wall  and gate. It looks as if no one had passed through in many years.\"    \"Looks are deceiving,\" declared the Shaggy Man, laughing at their  disappointed faces, \"and this barrier is the most deceiving thing in  all Oz.\"    \"It prevents our going any farther, anyhow,\" said Scraps. \"There is no  one to mind the gate and let people through, and we've no key to the  padlock.\"    \"True,\" replied Ojo, going a little nearer to peep through the bars of  the gate. \"What shall we do, Shaggy Man? If we had wings we might fly  over the wall, but we cannot climb it and unless we get to the Emerald  City I won't be able to find the things to restore Unc Nunkie to life.\"    \"All very true,\" answered the Shaggy Man, quietly; \"but I know this  gate, having passed through it many times.\"    \"How?\" they all eagerly inquired.    \"I'll show you how,\" said he. He stood Ojo in the middle of the road  and placed Scraps just behind him, with her padded hands on his  shoulders. After the Patchwork Girl came the Woozy, who held a part of  her skirt in his mouth. Then, last of all, was the Glass Cat, holding  fast to the Woozy's tail with her glass jaws.    \"Now,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"you must all shut your eyes tight, and  keep them shut until I tell you to open them.\"    \"I can't,\" objected Scraps. \"My eyes are buttons, and they won't shut.\"    So the Shaggy Man tied his red handkerchief over the Patchwork Girl's  eyes and examined all the others to make sure they had their eyes fast  shut and could see nothing.    \"What's the game, anyhow--blind-man's-buff?\" asked Scraps.    \"Keep quiet!\" commanded the Shaggy Man, sternly. \"All ready? Then  follow me.\"    He took Ojo's hand and led him forward over the road of yellow bricks,  toward the gate. Holding fast to one another they all followed in a  row, expecting every minute to bump against the iron bars. The Shaggy  Man also had his eyes closed, but marched straight ahead, nevertheless,  and after he had taken one hundred steps, by actual count, he stopped  and said:    \"Now you may open your eyes.\"    They did so, and to their astonishment found the wall and the gateway  far behind them, while in front the former Blue Country of the  Munchkins had given way to green fields, with pretty farm-houses  scattered among them.    \"That wall,\" explained the Shaggy Man, \"is what is called an optical  illusion. It is quite real while you have your eyes open, but if you  are not looking at it the barrier doesn't exist at all. It's the same  way with many other evils in life; they seem to exist, and yet it's all  seeming and not true. You will notice that the wall--or what we thought  was a wall--separates the Munchkin Country from the green country that  surrounds the Emerald City, which lies exactly in the center of Oz.  There are two roads of yellow bricks through the Munchkin Country, but  the one we followed is the best of the two. Dorothy once traveled the  other way, and met with more dangers than we did. But all our troubles  are over for the present, as another day's journey will bring us to the  great Emerald City.\"    They were delighted to know this, and proceeded with new courage. In a  couple of hours they stopped at a farmhouse, where the people were very  hospitable and invited them to dinner. The farm folk regarded Scraps  with much curiosity but no great astonishment, for they were accustomed  to seeing extraordinary people in the Land of Oz.    The woman of this house got her needle and thread and sewed up the  holes made by the porcupine quills in the Patchwork Girl's body, after  which Scraps was assured she looked as beautiful as ever.    \"You ought to have a hat to wear,\" remarked the woman, \"for that would  keep the sun from fading the colors of your face. I have some patches  and scraps put away, and if you will wait two or three days I'"]]]
