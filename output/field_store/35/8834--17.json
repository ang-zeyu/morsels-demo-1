[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#15)"],[1,"drove me back.  It was the sound of bare feet coming along  a corridor.    \"My narrow stair was stone, I tumbled down it with little noise, and  had only to push open the iron door, for I had left the keys in the  safe.  As I did so I heard a handle turn overhead, and thanked my gods  that I had shut every single door behind me.  You see, old chap, one's  caution doesn't always let one in!    \"'Who's that knocking?' said Ewbank up above.    \"I could not make out the answer, but it sounded to me like the  irrelevant supplication of a spent man.  What I did hear, plainly, was  the cocking of the bank revolver before the bolts were shot back.  Then, a tottering step, a hard, short, shallow breathing, and Ewbank's  voice in horror--    \"'My God!  Good Lord!  What's happened to you?  You're bleeding like a  pig!'    \"'Not now,' came with a grateful sort of sigh.    \"'But you have been!  What's done it?'    \"'Bushrangers.'    \"'Down the road?'    \"'This and Whittlesea--tied to tree--cock shots--left me--bleed to  death ...'\"    The weak voice failed, and the bare feet bolted.  Now was my time--if  the poor devil had fainted.  But I could not be sure, and there I  crouched down below in the dark, at the half-shut iron door, not less  spellbound than imprisoned.  It was just as well, for Ewbank wasn't  gone a minute.    \"'Drink this,' I heard him say, and, when the other spoke again, his  voice was stronger.    \"'Now I begin to feel alive ...'    \"'Don't talk!'    \"'It does me good.  You don't know what it was, all those miles alone,  one an hour at the outside!  I never thought I should come through. You  must let me tell you--in case I don't!'    \"'Well, have another sip.'    \"'Thank you ...  I said bushrangers; of course, there are no such  things nowadays.'    \"'What were they, then?'    \"'Bank-thieves; the one that had the pot shots was the very brute I  drove out of the bank at Coburg, with a bullet in him!'\"    \"I knew it!\"    \"Of course you did, Bunny; so did I, down in that strong-room; but old  Ewbank didn't, and I thought he was never going to speak again.    \"'You're delirious,' he says at last.  'Who in blazes do you think you  are?'    \"'The new manager.'    \"'The new manager's in bed and asleep upstairs.'    \"'When did he arrive?'    \"'This evening.'    \"'Call himself Raffles?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Well, I'm damned!' whispered the real man. 'I thought it was just  revenge, but now I see what it was.  My dear sir, the man upstairs is  an imposter--if he's upstairs still!  He must be one of the gang.  He's  going to rob the bank--if he hasn't done so already!'    \"'If he hasn't done so already,' muttered Ewbank after him; 'if he's  upstairs still!  By God, if he is, I'm sorry for him!'    \"His tone was quiet enough, but about the nastiest I ever heard.  I  tell you, Bunny, I was glad I'd brought that revolver.  It looked as  though it must be mine against his, muzzle to muzzle.    \"'Better have a look down here, first,' said the new manager.    \"'While he gets through his window?  No, no, he's not down here.'    \"'It's easy to have a look.'    \"Bunny, if you ask me what was the most thrilling moment of my infamous  career, I say it was that moment.  There I stood at the bottom of those  narrow stone stairs, inside the strong-room, with the door a good foot  open, and I didn't know whether it would creak or not.  The light was  coming nearer--and I didn't know!  I had to chance it.  And it didn't  creak a bit; it was far too solid and well-hung; and I couldn't have  banged it if I tried, it was too heavy; and it fitted so close that I  felt and heard the air squeeze out in my face.  Every shred of light  went out, except the streak underneath, and it brightened.  How I  blessed that door!    \"'No, he's not down THERE,' I heard, as though through cotton-wool;  then the streak went out too, and in a few seconds I ventured to open  once more, and was in time to hear them creeping to my room.    \"Well, now there was not a fifth of a second to be lost; but I'm proud  to say I came up those stairs on my toes and fingers, and out of that  bank (they'd gone and left the door open) just as gingerly as though my  time had been my own.  I didn't even forget to put on the hat that the  doctor's mare was eating her oats out of, as well as she could with a  bit, or it alone would have landed me.  I didn't even gallop away, but  just jogged off quietly in the thick dust at the side of the road  (though I own my heart was galloping), and thanked my stars the bank  was at that end of the township, in which I really hadn't set foot.  The very last thing I heard was the two managers raising Cain and the  coachman.  And now, Bunny--\"    He stood up and stretched himself, with a smile that ended in a yawn.  The black windows had faded through every shade of indigo; they now  framed their opposite neighbors, stark and livid in the dawn; and the  gas seemed turned to nothing in the globes.    \"But that's not all?\" I cried.    \"I'm sorry to say it is,\" said Raffles apologetically.  \"The thing  should have ended with an exciting chase, I know, but somehow it  didn't.  I suppose they thought I had got no end of a start; then they  had made up their minds that I belonged to the gang, which was not so  many miles away; and one of them had got as much as he could carry from  that gang as it was.  But I wasn't to know all that, and I'm bound to  say that there was plenty of excitement left for me.  Lord, how I made  that poor brute travel when I got among the trees! Though we must have  made it over fifty miles from Melbourne, we had done it at a snail's  pace; and those stolen oats had brisked the old girl up to such a pitch  that she fairly bolted when she felt her nose turned south.  By Jove,  it was no joke, in and out among those trees, and under branches with  your face in the mane!  I told you about the forest of dead gums?  It  looked perfectly ghostly in the moonlight.  And I found it as still as  I had left it--so still that I pulled up there, my first halt, and lay  with my ear to the ground for two or three minutes.  But I heard  nothing--not a thing but the mare's bellow and my own heart.  I'm  sorry, Bunny; but if ever you write my memoirs, you won't have any  difficulty in working up that chase. Play those dead gum-trees for all  they're worth, and let the bullets fly like hail.  I'll turn round in  my saddle to see Ewbank coming up hell-to-leather in his white suit,  and I'll duly paint it red.  Do it in the third person, and they won't  know how it's going to end.\"    \"But I don't know myself,\" I complained. \"Did the mare carry you all  the way back to Melbourne?\"    \"Every rod, pole or perch!  I had her well seen to at our hotel, and  returned her to the doctor in the evening.  He was tremendously tickled  to hear that I had been bushed; next morning he brought me the paper to  show me what I had escaped at Yea!\"    \"Without suspecting anything?\"    \"Ah!\" said Raffles, as he put out the gas; \"that's a point on which  I've never made up my mind. The mare and her color was a  coincidence--luckily she was only a bay--and I fancied the condition of  the beast must have told a tale.  The doctor's manner was certainly  different.  I'm inclined to think he suspected something, though not  the right thing.  I wasn't expecting him, and I fear my appearance may  have increased his suspicions.\"    I asked him why.    \"I used to have rather a heavy moustache,\" said Raffles, \"but I lost it  the day after I lost my innocence.\"        WILFUL MURDER    Of the various robberies in which we were both concerned, it is but the  few, I find, that will bear telling at any length.  Not that the others  contained details which even I would hesitate to recount; it is,  rather, the very absence of untoward incident which renders them  useless for my present purpose.  In point of fact our plans were so  craftily laid (by Raffles) that the chances of a hitch were invariably  reduced to a minimum before we went to work.  We might be disappointed  in the market value of our haul; but it was quite the exception for us  to find ourselves confronted by unforeseen impediments, or involved in  a really dramatic dilemma.  There was a sameness even in our spoil;  for, of course, only the most precious stones are worth the trouble we  took and the risks we ran.  In short, our most successful escapades  would prove the greatest weariness of all in narrative form; and none  more so than the dull affair of the Ardagh emeralds, some eight or nine  weeks after the Milchester cricket week.  The former, however, had a  sequel that I would rather forget than all our burglaries put together.    It was the evening after our return from Ireland, and I was waiting at  my rooms for Raffles, who had gone off as usual to dispose of the  plunder.  Raffles had his own method of conducting this very vital  branch of our business, which I was well content to leave entirely in  his hands.  He drove the bargains, I believe, in a thin but subtle  disguise of the flashy-seedy order, and always in the Cockney dialect,  of which he had made himself a master.  Moreover, he invariably  employed the same \"fence,\" who was ostensibly a money-lender in a small  (but yet notorious) way, and in reality a rascal as remarkable as  Raffles himself. Only lately I also had been to the man, but in my  proper person.  We had needed capital for the getting of these very  emeralds, and I had raised a hundred pounds, on the terms you would  expect, from a soft-spoken graybeard with an ingratiating smile, an  incessant bow, and the shiftiest old eyes that ever flew from rim to  rim of a pair of spectacles.  So the original sinews and the final  spoils of war came in this case from the self-same source--a  circumstance which appealed to us both.    But these same final spoils I was still to see, and I waited and waited  with an impatience that grew upon me with the growing dusk.  At my open  window "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#15)"],[1,"of attacking you here, I will endeavour  to escape with the children and rejoin you. I shall assuredly have no  cause for complaint. I shall, of course, have honourable treatment, and  apartments fitting to our rank assigned to me. It would be no great  hardship, and even were it so it would be worth enduring in order that our  son Charles should inherit his father's estate.\"    \"I could not part from you, love.\"    \"Nay, Eustace, as I have said, it cannot be for long; and you must  remember that twice when the children were infants I remained in England  with them while you were some months here. It would be no worse now. I  would take Guy with me; the lad has sense and courage, the children are  both fond of him, and I myself could, if occasion arose, take counsel with  him. Then I could have two or three stout men-at-arms who might ride in my  train in peaceful garb as retainers. As to a maid I can, if I need one,  hire her in Paris. Surely, husband, it would be far better so than that we  should lose castle and land. There could be little danger to one in Paris  at any time, still less to the wife of a vassal of the crown, least of all  to a hostage. I shall be but staying at the court. If you peril life and  limb, Eustace, in defence of your castle, surely it is not much that I  should put myself to the slight inconvenience of a stay in Paris for a  while.\"    \"I like it not,\" the knight said moodily. \"I see well enough that what you  say is true, and that you should be safe at Charles's court, indeed safer  than here. The citizens of Paris are indeed turbulent, whether they shout  for Orleans or Burgundy, but what if Henry of England should again lead an  army here?\"    \"But why imagine what is not likely to happen? Long ere Henry comes I may  have joined you again; should it be otherwise I might perhaps escape, or  at the very worst of all they could but keep me in duress in my chamber.  Who ever heard of a woman being ill-treated for the disobedience of her  lord? All that they could do would be to make you pay ransom for my  return.\"    \"I would rather go as a hostage myself.\"    \"Nay, husband, that could hardly be. Who would then take care of your  castle? It is not a hard thing that the king asks, merely that I and the  children shall for a time live at his court as a proof that you, his  vassal, hold your castle for him. Even if the worst comes to the worst we  can but lose castle and land, as we must lose it now if I do not go. Nay,  my dear lord, do not wrinkle your brow, we cannot strive against the might  of France; and at present we must bow our heads and wait until the storm  has passed, and hope for better times. There may be an English war; ere  long Henry may again extend his frontiers, and you might again become a  vassal of England for these possessions of yours even as your fathers  were.\"    \"I see that reason is on your side, Margaret, and yet I cannot bring  myself to like the plan.\"    \"Nor do I like it, husband; yet I feel that it were a thousand times  better that I should be separated from you for a time than that we should  risk another siege. The last has cost us dear enough, another might take  you from me.\"    \"Well, well, dear, I suppose you must have your way; indeed I do not see  that harm can possibly come to you, and it will at any rate ensure peace  for a time and enable us to repair our tenants' losses. I shall send over  a message at once to Sir Aylmer, and beg him to choose and send me another  fifty archers--with that reinforcement I could make head against any  attack save in the greatest force--for there is no saying how things may  go. The five-and-twenty did wonders, and with thrice that force I should  feel confident that Villeroy could withstand any attack save by an army  with an abundance of great machines.    \"Well, Margaret, since you have decided for me that you are to go--and  indeed I myself plainly see that that alternative is really the best--let  us talk over who you had best take with you. I quite approve of your  choice of Guy; he is a good lad, and will make a brave knight some day. I  shall now make him one of my esquires, and as such he will always be in  attendance on you; and assuredly Agnes and Charlie will, as well as  yourself, benefit by his presence. He will be able to take them out and  look after them, and as he talks French as well as English the lad will be  useful to you in many ways. Have you any preference as to the four men-at-arms?\"    \"Could you spare Tom, the leader of the archers? I should like to have  another Englishman with me, and he is very good-tempered and obliging. He  is shrewd too, and with his strength and courage I should feel that I  could wholly rely upon him in any strait, though indeed I see not that  there is any probability of such occurring.\"    \"Certainly you can have him, Margaret, and I shall be glad to know that he  is with you. Dickon, who is next under him, can act as captain of the  archers while he is away. I have noticed that Tom is picking up the  language fast. He is always ready to do little kindnesses to the women and  children, and I have often heard him talking with them. He will soon get  to speak the language fairly. As to the others have you any choice?\"    \"No, I think you had better choose them for me, Eustace.\"    \"They had better be French,\" he said; \"it would not do for you to surround  yourself entirely by English, although of course it is natural enough that  you should have an English squire and servant. I think that you could not  do better than take Jules Varey and Albert Bongarde. They are both stout  men-at-arms, prudent fellows, and not given to the wine-cup. As a fourth I  would say Jean Picard's son; he is a stout fellow too, and I know that,  but for his father's hopes that he will one day succeed him as butler, he  would have taken service regularly as a man-at-arms. He fought stoutly  when the French gained the wall, and I marked him exchanging blows with  Sir Clugnet himself, and bearing himself as well as any man there. You  could choose no better.\"    \"So be it,\" she said. \"I think, Eustace, that with four such defenders, to  say nothing of young Guy, you need not feel uneasy about us.\"    \"I don't think that I shall feel uneasy, Margaret; but I know that I can  ill spare you. You have ever been at my side since we were married, save  when, after the birth of Agnes and Charles, you were forced to stay in  England when I came over here. I felt it a dreary time then, and shall  feel it so now; but I doubt not that all will go well with you, though it  will be a very different life to that to which you have been accustomed.\"    \"I shall do well enough,\" Margaret said cheerfully, \"and maybe I shall get  so fond of court that you will have to take me to that of Henry when we  return to England.\"    \"Now you had best begin to make your preparations. I will speak to Guy and  the others myself.\"    Sir Eustace went into the court-yard, where Guy was superintending the  issue of provisions for the women.    \"This can go on without you,\" he said; \"Gervaise will see to it. I would  speak to you. You were at the meeting this morning, Guy, and you heard  what the herald of France said. The position is a hard one. I cannot hold  the castle against the strength of France, while if we take a Burgundian  garrison I should cease to be its master, and it would doubtless soon pass  into other hands. Again, if I go to England, it would equally be lost to  us. Therefore my wife has resolved, in order to gain time until these  disorders are over, to go to Paris with the children as a hostage for me.  In no case, as it seems to me, are Dame Margaret and the children likely  to be in danger; nevertheless, I am greatly loth for them to go. However,  seeing no other way out of the business, I have consented, and we have  arranged that you shall accompany her. You will go as my esquire, and I  shall install you as such this afternoon. You will take Long Tom, two of  the men-at-arms, and Robert Picard, all good men and true; but at the same  time the burden and responsibility must rest upon your shoulders. You are  young yet for so grave a charge, and yet I feel that I can confide it to  you. You will have to be the stay and support of your mistress, you will  have to be the companion and friend of my children, and I shall charge the  four men-at-arms to take orders from you as from me. Tom will be a  valuable fellow. In the first place, he is, I know, much attached to you,  besides being shrewd, and a very giant in strength. The other three are  all honest varlets, and you can rely upon them in any pinch.\"    \"I will do my best, my lord,\" Guy said quietly; \"and I am grateful to you  indeed for the confidence that you show in me, and I shall, I hope, prove  worthy of it, and of my father.\"    The news soon spread through the castle that Dame Margaret was going to  Paris. The maids wept at the thought, as did many of the tenants' wives,  for since the siege began, her kindness and the pains that she had taken  to make them comfortable had endeared her greatly to them. On her previous  visits they had seen comparatively little of her; she had been to them  simply their lord's English wife, now they knew her as a friend.  Nevertheless, their regret at her leaving was softened by the thought that  her going to be near the king insured peace for them, and that they would  now be able to venture out to the houses that were fast rising on the  ruins of their former homes, and to take up their life again as they had  left it.    Early next morning the little cortege mustered in the court-yard in  readiness for a start. Sir Eustace and his wife had said good-bye to each  other in their chamber, and she looked calm and tranquil as she mounted  her horse; for, having been accustomed from a child to ride with her  father hunting and hawking, she could sit a horse well, and scorned to  ride, as did so"]]]
