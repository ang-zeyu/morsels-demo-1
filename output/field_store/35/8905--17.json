At the end of two hours, after having ascended a  little by a paved causeway formed across the valley, which is about  forty yards in breadth, we entered Wady Muna. Near the causeway we saw a  small field, irrigated by means of a brackish well, where a few  miserable Bedouins raised onions and leeks for the market at Mekka. I  shall give hereafter a more detailed description of Wady Muna, where the  Hadj remains three days after its return from Arafat.    We continued our route among the ruined houses of Muna, passed the short  columns, at which the pilgrims throw stones, then the Sherifs palace,  and issued into the open country, which continues thence towards  Mezdelife, distant three hours and three quarters from Mekka. This name  is given to a small mosque, now almost in ruins, close to which is a  tank or reservoir of water. Here a sermon is preached from a high  platform in front of the mosque, to the pilgrims after their return from  Arafat. El Fasy, the historian, says that this mosque was built in A.H.  759. It is often called Moshár el Haram; but, according to the same  author, this name belongs to a small hill at the    [p.60] extremity of the valley of Mezdelife, which bears also the  appellation of El Kazeh. From Mezdelife two roads lead to Arafat; the  one on the left along the plain or valley called Dhob; the other leads  straight across the mountain, and joins the former near the Aalameyn. We  proceeded along the great road in the valley. At four hours and a  quarter the mountains again close, and a narrow pass called El Mazomeyn  or El Medyk leads across them for half an hour, after which the view  opens upon the plain of Arafat. At the end of four hours and three  quarters, we passed, in this plain, a tank called Bir Basan, constructed  of stone, with a small chapel adjoining. Here the country opens widely  to the north and south. Eastward, the mountains of Tayf are seen for the  first time in their full height. [On my return from Tayf to Mekka, when I  was completely my own master, I drew up a much more detailed and  accurate description of the road than this given here; but I  accidentally lost the papers containing it; the present, therefore, is  written from memory, and the few short notes which I hastily made during  the route to Tayf.] At five hours we reached El Aalameyn, two stone  structures standing one on each side of the road, from eighty to one  hundred paces from each other, and between them the pilgrims must pass  in going, and more particularly in returning from Arafat. They are of  coarse masonry, plaistered white, and the annexed outline represents  their form.[Not included]    Fasy says that there were formerly three, that they were built in A.H.  605, and that one had fallen. Of those now remaining one is entire, the  other half ruined. At five hours and a quarter we passed to our right a  large insulated mosque in a state of decay, called Djama Nimre, or Djama  Ibrahim, built as it now stands by the Sultan Kail, Bey of Egypt. The  low mountain of    [p.61] Arafat was now to our left at the extremity of the plain, about  two miles distant. We proceeded, without stopping, over the plain, which  is covered with shrubs of considerable height, and low acacia trees:  from these it is prohibited to take even the smallest branch, this being  holy ground. On attaining the eastern limits of the plain, we reached,  at five hours and three quarters, the canal of Mekka, issuing from the  mountainous ground. Near it is a small tank, and in its vicinity a  cluster of Arab huts similar to those at Hadda, and bearing the name of  Kahwet Arafat, or the coffee-house of Arafat. They are inhabited chiefly  by Beni Koreysh, who cultivate vegetables in a valley extending from  hence towards the south. We rested here some hours; a caravan from Tayf,  composed of mules and asses, arrived at the same time.    From Kahwet Arafat, the road becomes rocky, and the mountains nearly  close, and are intersected by valleys which cross the road in every  direction. Acacia-trees grow here in great abundance. At seven hours and  a half we again entered upon sandy ground, in a valley called Wady  Noman, where, towards the south, are some wells, and a few plantations  cultivated by the Arab tribes of Kebákeb and Ryshye. At eight hours and  a half we passed an encampment of the Bedouin tribe of Hodheyl, where  dogs attacked our camels so fiercely that I had much difficulty, though  mounted, to defend myself from their teeth. At eight hours and three  quarters we passed a cluster of huts and coffee-shops, called shedad,  with wells of very good water. At nine hours and a half, it being a  cloudy and extremely dark night, we lost our way in following the  windings of a side valley, and being unable to regain the right road, we  lay down on the sand and slept till day-break.    August 27th.--We found ourselves close to the road, and proceeding, we  began to ascend, in half an hour, the great chain of mountains. From  Djjdda to this place, our route, though generally between hills and  mountains, had been constantly over flat    [p.62] ground, in valleys, with an ascent almost imperceptible to the  traveller, and the existence of which became visible only in viewing the  country from the summit of the mountains now before us. The lower hills  are seldom higher than four or five hundred feet. The lowest range above  Djidda is calcareous; but its rocks soon change into gneiss, and a  species of granite, with schorl in the place of feldspath, accompanied  by predominant masses of quartz, and some mica. This rock continues  along the road, with few variations, as far as the vicinity of Djebel  Nour, to the eastward of Mekka, where granite begins. I learned at  Mekka, that, south of Hadda, some hours distant, a mountain yields fine  marble, which served for the pavement of the great mosque. The mountains  forming the valley of Muna are composed of this red and grey granite,  and continue so from thence to this higher chain, mixed in a few places  with strata of grunstein. The lower chain of the high ridge which we  were now ascending, again, consists of grey granite; towards the middle  I found it of all colours, mixed with strata of grunstein, trappe, and  porphyry schistus, the latter much decayed: at the summit of the ridge,  red granite occurred again; its surface had been completely blackened by  the suns rays.    We ascended by a road, still bad, although Mohammed Ali Pasha had  recently caused it to be repaired. The country around was very wild,  being covered with large blocks of loose stones, carried down by the  winter torrents, and interspersed with a few acacia and nebek trees. At  one hour we came to a building of loose stones, called Kaber Er-rafyk,  i.e. the Companions tomb. The following tradition concerning it was  related by my guide. In the last century, a Bedouin returning from the  Hadj was joined, beyond the gates of Mekka, by a traveller going the  same road with himself; they reached this spot in company, when one of  them felt himself so ill, that he was unable to proceed farther, and on  the following day the small-pox broke out on his body. In this situation  his companion    [p.63] would not abandon him. He built two huts with boughs of acacia-  trees, one for his friend, the other for himself; and continued to nurse  him, and solicit alms for his benefit from passing travellers, until he  recovered. But in turn, he himself became ill of the same disease, and  was nursed by his convalescent companion with equal kindness, though not  with equal success; for he died, and was interred by his friend on this  spot, where his tomb serves as a monument of Bedouin generosity, and  inculcates benevolence even towards the casual companions of the road.    At one hour and a half, still ascending, we reached some huts built  among the rocks, near a copious spring; they are named Kahwet Kora, from  the mountains which collectively bear the name of Djebel Kora. I found  here a Turkish soldier, charged with the transport of provisions for the  Pashas army over the mountain. This being the shortest road from Mekka  to Tayf, caravans are continually passing. The camel-loads are deposited  at this place, and then forwarded to the summit of the mountain on mules  and asses, of which about two hundred are kept here. On the mountain  camels are prepared for carrying the loads to Tayf. The more northern  road to Tayf, of which I shall speak hereafter, is passable for camels  all the way; but it is by one day longer than this.    The huts of Kora are constructed between the rocks, on the slope of the  mountain, where there is scarcely any level surface. The inhabitants are  Hodheyl Bedouins. In two or three huts nothing could be procured but  coffee and water. The Turkish soldier had lately incurred the Pashas  displeasure, having stolen and sold the camel of a Hodheyl woman, who  had gone to lay her complaint before his master, the Pasha, at Tayf. The  soldier treated me with much civility, when he learned that I was going  to visit the Pasha, and begged me to intercede in his behalf; this,  however, I declined to do, telling him that I was myself a solicitor for  my own concerns. We remained till mid-day at this    [p.64] pleasant spot, from whence there is a fine prospect over the  lower country. A large nebek-tree, near the spring which drizzles down  the rocks, afforded me shade, and a delicious cool breeze allayed the  sultry heat which we had endured ever since our departure from Djidda.  Leaving Kora, we found the road very steep, and, although it had lately  been repaired, so bad, that a mounted traveller could hardly hope to  reach the summit without alighting. Steps had been cut in several  places, and the ascent rendered less steep, by conducting it, in many  windings, to the top: half a dozen spacious resting-places had also been  formed on the side of the mountain, where the caravans"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#15)"],[1,"without interrupting their studies--to compel them to look after  their own wants themselves? That is to say, without compelling them  to really do their own cooking, would it not be wise to have them eat  soldiers' bread or something no better, to accustom them to beat and  brush their own clothes, to clean their own boots and shoes, and  do other things equally useful and self-helpful? If they were thus  accustomed to a sober life, and to be particular about their appearance,  they would become healthier and stronger; they could support with  courage the hardships of war, and inspire with respect and blind  devotion the soldiers who would have to serve under their orders.\" How  do you think the grand minister of war would have felt to get such a  lecturing on discipline from a boy at school? and what do you imagine  the boys would have done had they heard that one of their schoolmates  had written a letter, suggesting that they be deprived of their  pleasures and pamperings? It was lucky for young Napoleon that the  principal at Brienne got hold of the letter before it was forwarded to  the war minister.    But then, as you have heard before, Napoleon was an odd boy. He thought  so himself when he grew to be a man, and he laughed at the recollection  of his manners. He laid it all, however, to the responsibility he had  felt, even from the day when he was a little fellow, because of the  needs of his hard-pushed family in Corsica. \"All these cares,\" he once  said, looking back over his boy-life, \"spoiled my early years; they  influenced my temper, and made me grave before my time.\"    Even if he did not send that critical and most unwise letter for a boy  of his standing, the insight he gained into the expensive ways of the  pupils at the military school had its effect upon him; and the very  criticisms of that remarkable letter were used for their original  purpose when Napoleon came to authority and power. For, when he was  emperor of France, he gave to the minister who had the military  schools in charge this order: \"No pupil is to cost the state more than  twenty-five cents a day. These pupils are sons either of soldiers or  of working-men; it is absolutely contrary to my intention to give them  habits of life which can only be hurtful to them.\"    If Napoleon was so critical as to the ways and style of his schoolmates,  he certainly set the lesson in economy for himself that he suggested for  them.    To be sure, he had no money to waste or to spend; but he might have been  hail-fellow with the other boys, and joined in their luxuries, had he  but been willing to borrow, as did the rest of them. But Napoleon  had always a horror of debt. He had acquired this from his mother's  teachings and his father's spendthrift ways. Even as a boy, however,  his will was so strong, his power of self-denial was so great, that  he continued in what he considered the path of duty, unmindful of  the boyish charges of \"mean fellow\" and \"pauper\" that the spoiled  spendthrifts of the school had no hesitation in casting at him.    At last, however, these culminated almost in an open row; and Napoleon  found himself called upon either to explain his position, or become both  unpopular and an \"outcast\" because of what his schoolmates considered  his stinginess and parsimony.    It was this way--But I had better tell you the story in a new chapter.          CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    A TROUBLE OVER POCKET MONEY.    It was the twelfth of June in the year 1785 that a group of scholars was  standing, during the recess hour, in a corner of the military school of  Paris.    They were all boys; but they assumed the manners and gave themselves the  airs of princes of the blood.    \"Gentlemen,\" said one who seemed to be most prominent in the group, \"I  have called you together on a most important matter. Tomorrow is old  Bauer's birthday. I propose that, as is our custom, we take some notice  of it. What do you say to giving him a little supper, in the name of the  school?\"    \"A good idea; a capital idea, d'Hebonville!\" exclaimed most of the boys,  in ready acquiescence.    \"A gluttonous idea, I call it; and an expensive one,\" said one upon the  outer edge of the circle, in a sharply critical tone. \"Ah. our little  joker has a word to say,\" exclaimed one of the boys sarcastically,  drawing back, and pushing the speaker to the front; \"hear him.\"    \"Oh, now, Napoleon! don't object,\" young Alexander des Mazes said. \"Did  you not hear why d'Hebonville proposed the supper? It is to honor the  German teacher's birthday.\"    \"Oh, he heard it fast enough, des Mazes,\" rejoined d'Hebonville. \"That  is what makes him so cross.\"    \"Why do you say that?\" Napoleon demanded.    \"You do not like the plan because it is to honor old Bauer; for you do  not like him,\" d'Hebonville replied. \"If, now, it were a supper to the  history teacher, you would agree, I am sure. For de l'Equille praises  you on 'the profundity of your reflections and the sagacity of your  judgment.' Oh, I've read his notes; or you would agree if it were  Domaisen, the rhetoric teacher, who is much impressed--those are  his very words, are they not, gentlemen?--with 'your powers of  generalization, which' he says, are even 'as granite heated at a  volcano.' But as it is only dear old Bauer\"--and d'Hebonville shrugged  his shoulders significantly. \"Well, and what about 'dear old Bauer,' as  you call him?\" cried Napoleon; \"finish, sir; finish, I say.\"    \"I will tell you what Father Bauer says of you, Napoleon,\" said des  Mazes laughingly, as he laid his arm familiarly about Napoleon's neck;  \"he says he does not think much of you, because you make no progress in  your German; and as old Bauer thinks the world moves only for Germans,  he has nothing good to say of one who makes no mark in his dear  language. 'Ach!' says old Bauer, 'your Napoleon Bonaparte will never be  anything but a fool. He knows no German.'\"    The boys laughed loudly at des Mazes's mimicry of the German teacher's  manner and speech. But Napoleon smiled with the air of one who felt  himself superior to the teacher of German.    \"Now, I should say,\" said Philip Mabille, \"that here is the very reason  why Napoleon should not refuse to join us. It will be--what are the  words?--'heaping coals of fire' on old Bauer's head.\"    \"That might be so,\" Napoleon agreed, in a better humor. \"But why give  him a feast? Let us--I'll tell you--let us give him a spectacle. A  battle, perhaps.\"    \"In which you should be a general, I suppose, as you were in that  snow--ball fight at Brienne, of which we have heard once or twice,\" said  d'Hebonville sarcastically.    \"And why not?\" asked Napoleon haughtily.    \"Or the death of Caesar, like the tableaux we arranged at Brienne,\"  suggested Demetrius Comneno enthusiastically.    \"In which your great Napoleon played Brutus, I suppose,\" said  d'Hebonville. \"No, no; the birthday of old Bauer is not a solemn  occasion to demand a battle or a spectacle; something much more simple  will do for a professor of German. Let us make it a good collation.  There are fifteen of us in his class. If each one of us contributes five  dollars, we could get up quite a feast.\"    \"Oh, see here, d'Hebonville!\" cried Mabille; \"think a little. Five  dollars is a good deal for some of us. Not all of the fifteen can  afford so much. I don't believe I could; nor you, Napoleon, could you?\"  Napoleon's face grew sober, but he said nothing.    \"Oh, well! let only those pay then who can,\" said d'Hebonville.    \"Who, then, will take part in your feast?\" demanded Napoleon.    \"Why, all of us, of course,\" replied d'Hebonville.    \"At the feast, or in giving the money,\" queried Mabille.    \"At the feast, to be sure,\" d'Hebonville answered.    \"Come, now; we should have no feeling in this matter,\" cried des Mazes.  \"We will decide for you, Mabille.\"    \"Old Bauer must not dream that there are any of his class who do not  share in the matter,\" said Comneno. \"That would be showing a preference,  and a preference is never fair.\"    \"And do you wish, then,\" said Mabille, \"that old Bauer should be under  obligation to me, for example, who can pay little or nothing toward the  feast?\"    \"Certainly; to you as much as to the richest among us,\" said  d'Hebonville.    \"Bah!\" cried Napoleon. \"That would imply a sentiment of gratitude toward  my masters; and I, for one, have none to this Professor Bauer.\"    \"Some one to see Napoleon Bonaparte,\" said a porter of the school,  appearing at the door of the schoolroom. \"He waits in the parlor.\"    Without a word Napoleon left his school-fellows; but they looked after  him with faces expressive of disapproval or disappointment.    The disagreeable impression produced by the discussion in which he had  been taking part still remained with Napoleon as he entered the parlor  to meet his visitor. It was the friend of his family, Monsieur de  Permon.    Napoleon, indeed, was scarce able to greet his visitor pleasantly. But  Monsieur de Permon, without appearing to notice the boy's ill-humor,  greeted him pleasantly, and said,--    \"Madame de Permon and I are on our way to the Academy of St. Cyr, to see  your sister Eliza. Would you not like to go with us, Napoleon? I have  permission for you to be absent\"    Napoleon brightened at this invitation, and gladly accepted it. The two  proceeded to the carriage, in which Madame Permon was awaiting them; and  the three were soon on the road to the school of St. Cyr, in which, as I  have told you, Eliza Bonaparte was a scholar.    They were ushered into the parlor, and Eliza was summoned. She soon  appeared; but she entered the room slowly and disconsolately; her eyes  were red with crying. Eliza was evidently in trouble.    \"Why, Eliza, my dear child, what is the matter?\" Madame Permon  exclaimed, drawing the girl toward her. \"You have been crying. Have they  been scolding you here?\"    \"No, madame,\" Eliza replied in a low tone.    \"Are you"]]]
