CLASSES OF NOUNS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--Hereafter, in the \"Hints,\" we shall drop the  dialogue form, but we expect the teacher to continue it. A poor teacher  does all the talking, a good teacher makes the pupils talk.    The teacher may here refer to his talk about the classification of birds,  and show that, after birds have been arranged in great classes, such as  robins, sparrows, etc., these classes will need to be subdivided, if the  pupil is to be made thoroughly acquainted with this department of the  animal kingdom. So, after grouping _words_ into the eight great classes,  called Parts of Speech, these classes may be divided into other classes.  For instance, take the two nouns _city_ and _Brooklyn_. The word _city_ is  the _common_ name of all places of a certain class, but the word _Brooklyn_  is the _proper_ or particular name of an _individual_ of this class. We  have here, then, two kinds of nouns which we call +Common+ and +Proper+.    Let the teacher write a number of nouns on the board, and require the pupil  to classify them and give the reasons for the classification.    To prepare the pupil thoroughly for this work, the teacher will find it  necessary to explain why such words as _music, mathematics, knowledge_,  etc., are common nouns. _Music, e. g._, is not a proper noun, for it is not  a name given to an individual thing to distinguish it from other things of  the same class. There are no other things of the same class--it forms a  class by itself. So we call the noun _music_ a _common_ noun.    CLASSES OF PRONOUNS.    The speaker seldom refers to himself by name, but uses the pronoun _I_  instead. In speaking _to_ a person, we often use the pronoun _you_ instead  of his name. In speaking _of_ a person or thing that has been mentioned  before, we say _he_ or _she_ or _it_. These words that by their _form_  indicate the speaker, the hearer, or the person or thing spoken of, are  called +Personal Pronouns+. See Lesson 19, \"Hints.\"    Give sentences containing nouns repeated, and require the pupils to improve  these sentences by substituting pronouns.    When we wish to refer to an object that has been mentioned in _another_  clause, and at the same time to _connect the clauses_, we use a class of  pronouns called +Relative Pronouns+. Let the teacher illustrate by using  the pronouns _who, which_, and _that_. See Lesson 57, \"Hints for Oral  Instruction.\"    When we wish to ask about anything whose _name is unknown_, we use a class  of pronouns called +Interrogative Pronouns+. The interrogative pronoun  stands for the unknown name, and asks for it; as, _Who_ comes here? _What_  is this?    _Both men were wrong_. Let us omit _men_ and say, _Both were wrong_. You  see the meaning is not changed--_both_ is here equivalent to _both men_,  that is, it performs the office of an adjective and that of a noun. It is  therefore an +Adjective Pronoun+. Let the teacher further illustrate the  office of the adjective pronoun by using the words _each, all, many, some,  such_, etc.    DEFINITIONS.    CLASSES OF NOUNS.    +A _Common Noun_ is a name which belongs to all things of a class+.    +A _Proper Noun_ is the particular name of an individual+.    CLASSES OF PRONOUNS.    +A _Personal Pronoun_ is a pronoun that by its form denotes the speaker,  the one spoken to, or the one spoken of+.    +A _Relative Pronoun_ is one that relates to some preceding word or words,  and connects clauses+.    +An _Interrogative Pronoun_ is one with which a question is asked+.    +An _Adjective Pronoun_ is one that performs the offices of both an  adjective and a noun+.          LESSON 72.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Build each of the following groups of nouns into a sentence.

Write five simple sentences, each containing one of the five personal  pronouns: _I, thou_ or _you, he, she_, and _it_.    Write four complex sentences, each containing one of the four relative  pronouns: _who, which, that_, and _what_.    _What_ is used as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is omitted. The  word for which a pronoun stands is called its antecedent. When we express  the antecedent, we use _which_ or _that_. I shall do _what_ is required; I  shall do the _thing which_ is required, or _that_ is required.    Build three interrogative sentences, each containing one of the three  interrogative pronouns: _who, which_, and _what_.

The province of Caracas,* (* The province, not the  capitania-general, consequently not including the cacao plantations of  Cumana, the province of Barcelona, of Maracaybo, of Varinas, and of  Spanish Guiana.) at the end of the eighteenth century, produced  annually a hundred and fifty thousand fanegas, of which a hundred  thousand were consumed in Spain, and thirty thousand in the province.  Estimating a fanega of cacao at only twenty-five piastres for the  price given at Cadiz, we find that the total value of the exportation  of cacao, by the six ports of the Capitania General of Caracas,  amounts to four million eight hundred thousand piastres. So important  an object of commerce merits a careful discussion; and I flatter  myself, that, from the great number of materials I have collected on  all the branches of colonial agriculture, I shall be able to add  something to the information published by M. Depons, in his valuable  work on the provinces of Venezuela.    The tree which produces the cacao is not at present found wild in the  forests of Terra Firma to the north of the Orinoco; we began to find  it only beyond the cataracts of Ature and Maypure. It abounds  particularly near the banks of the Ventuari, and on the Upper Orinoco,  between the Padamo and the Gehette. This scarcity of wild cacao-trees  in South America, north of the latitude of 6 degrees, is a very  curious phenomenon of botanical geography, and yet little known. This  phenomenon appears the more surprising, as, according to the annual  produce of the harvest, the number of trees in full bearing in the  cacao-plantations of Caracas, Nueva Barcelona, Venezuela, Varinas, and  Maracaybo, is estimated at more than sixteen millions. The wild  cacao-tree has many branches, and is covered with a tufted and dark  foliage. It bears a very small fruit, like that variety which the  ancient Mexicans called tlalcacahuatl. Transplanted into the conucos  of the Indians of Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro, the wild tree  preserves for several generations that force of vegetable life, which  makes it bear fruit in the fourth year; while, in the province of  Caracas, the harvest begins only the sixth, seventh, or eighth year.  It is later in the inland parts than on the coasts and in the valley  of Guapo. We met with no tribe on the Orinoco that prepared a beverage  with the seeds of the cacao-tree. The savages suck the pulp of the  pod, and throw away the seeds, which are often found in heaps where  they have passed the night. Though chorote, which is a very weak  infusion of cacao, is considered on the coast to be a very ancient  beverage, no historical fact proves that chocolate, or any preparation  whatever of cacao, was known to the natives of Venezuela before the  arrival of the Spaniards. It appears to me more probable that the  cacao-plantations of Caracas were suggested by those of Mexico and  Guatimala; and that the Spaniards inhabiting Terra Firma learned the  cultivation of the cacao-tree, sheltered in its youth by the foliage  of the erythrina and plantain;* (This process of the Mexican  cultivators, practised on the coast of Caracas, is described in the  memoirs known under the title of \"Relazione di certo Gentiluomo del  Signor Cortez, Conquistadore del Messico.\" (Ramusio, tome 2 page  134).) the fabrication of cakes of chocolatl, and the use of the  liquid of the same name, in course of their communications with  Mexico, Guatimala, and Nicaragua.    Down to the sixteenth century travellers differed in opinion  respecting the chocolatl. Benzoni plainly says that it is a drink  \"fitter for hogs than men.\"* (* Benzoni, Istoria del Mondo Nuovo, 1572  page 104.) The Jesuit Acosta asserts, that \"the Spaniards who inhabit  America are fond of chocolate to excess; but that it requires to be  accustomed to that black beverage not to be disgusted at the mere  sight of its froth, which swims on it like yeast on a fermented  liquor.\" He adds, \"the cacao is a prejudice (una supersticion) of the  Mexicans, as the coca is a prejudice of the Peruvians.\" These opinions  remind us of Madame de Sevigne's prediction respecting the use of  coffee. Fernando Cortez and his page, the gentilhombre del gran  Conquistador, whose memoirs were published by Ramusio, on the  contrary, highly praise chocolate, not only as an agreeable drink,  though prepared cold,* but in particular as a nutritious substance. (*  Father Gili has very clearly shown, from two passages in Torquemada  (Monarquia Indiana, lib. 14) that the Mexicans prepared the infusion  cold, and that the Spaniards introduced the custom of preparing  chocolate by boiling water with the paste of cacao.) \"He who has drunk  one cup,\" says the page of Fernando Cortez, \"can travel a whole day  without any other food, especially in very hot climates; for chocolate  is by its nature cold and refreshing.\" We shall not subscribe to the  latter part of this assertion; but we shall soon have occasion, in our  voyage on the Orinoco, and our excursions towards the summit of the  Cordilleras, to celebrate the salutary properties of chocolate. It is  easily conveyed and readily employed: as an aliment it contains a  large quantity of nutritive and stimulating particles in a small  compass. It has been said with truth, that in the East, rice, gum, and  ghee (clarified butter), assist man in crossing the deserts; and so,  in the New World, chocolate and the flour of maize, have rendered  accessible to the traveller the table-lands of the Andes, and vast  uninhabited forests.    The cacao harvest is extremely variable. The tree vegetates with such  vigour that flowers spring out even from the roots, wherever the earth  leaves them uncovered. It suffers from the north-east winds, even when  they lower the temperature only a few degrees. The heavy showers that  fall irregularly after the rainy season, during the winter months,  from December to March, are also very hurtful to the cacao-tree. The  proprietor of a plantation of fifty thousand trees often loses the  value of more than four or five thousand piastres in cacao in one  hour. Great humidity is favourable to the tree only when it augments  progressively, and is for a long time uninterrupted. If, in the season  of drought, the leaves and the young fruit be wetted by a violent  shower, the fruit falls from the stem; for it appears that the vessels  which absorb water break from being rendered turgid. Besides, the  cacao-harvest is one of the most uncertain, on account of the fatal  effects of inclement seasons, and the great number of worms, insects,  birds, and quadrupeds,* (* Parrots, monkeys, agoutis, squirrels, and  stags.) which devour the pod of the cacao-tree; and this branch of  agriculture has the disadvantage of obliging the new planter to wait  eight or ten years for the fruit of his labours, and of yielding after  all an article of very difficult preservation.    The finest plantations of cacao are found in the province of Caracas,  along the coast, between Caravalleda and the mouth of the Rio Tocuyo,  in the valleys of Caucagua, Capaya, Curiepe, and Guapo; and in those  of Cupira, between cape Conare and cape Unare, near Aroa,  Barquesimeto, Guigue, and Uritucu. The cacao that grows on the banks  of the Uritucu, at the entrance of the llanos, in the jurisdiction of  San Sebastian de las Reyes, is considered to be of the finest quality.  Next to the cacao of Uritucu comes that of Guigue, of Caucagua, of  Capaya, and of Cupira. The merchants of Cadiz assign the first rank to  the cacao of Caracas, immediately after that of Socomusco; and its  price is generally from thirty to forty per cent higher than that of  Guayaquil.    It is only since the middle of the seventeenth century, when the  Dutch, tranquil possessors of the island of Curacoa, awakened, by  their smuggling, the agricultural industry of the inhabitants of the  neighbouring coasts, that cacao has become an object of exportation in  the province of Caracas. We are ignorant of everything that passed in  those countries before the establishment of the Biscay Company of  Guipuzcoa, in 1728. No precise statistical data have reached us: we  only know that the exportation of cacao from Caracas scarcely  amounted, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, to thirty  thousand fanegas a-year. From 1730 to 1748, the company sent to Spain  eight hundred and fifty-eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight  fanegas, which make, on an average, forty-seven thousand seven hundred  fanegas a-year; the price of the fanega fell, in 1732, to forty-five  piastres, when it had before kept at eighty piastres. In 1763 the  cultivation had so much augmented, that the exportation rose to eighty  thousand six hundred and fifty-nine fanegas.    In an official document, taken from the papers of the minister of  finance, the annual produce (la cosecha) of the province of Caracas is  estimated at a hundred and thirty-five thousand fanegas of cacao;  thirty-three thousand of which are for home consumption, ten thousand  for other Spanish colonies, seventy-seven thousand for the  mother-country, fifteen thousand for the illicit commerce with the  French, English, Dutch, and Danish colonies. From 1789 to 1793, the  importation of cacao from Caracas into Spain was, on an average,  seventy-seven thousand seven hundred and nineteen fanegas a-year, of  which sixty-five thousand seven hundred and sixty-six were consumed in  the country, and eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three exported  to France, Italy, and Germany.    The late wars have had much more fatal effects on the cacao trade of  Caracas than on that of Guayaquil. On account of the increase of  price, less cacao of the first quality has been consumed in Europe.  Instead of mixing, as was done formerly"]]]
