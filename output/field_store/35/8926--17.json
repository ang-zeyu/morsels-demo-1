JEREMY FISHER    BY  BEATRIX POTTER      _Author of_  _\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\" &c._        FREDERICK WARNE & CO., INC.  NEW YORK          COPYRIGHT, 1906  BY  FREDERICK WARNE & CO        FOR  STEPHANIE  FROM  COUSIN B.            Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a  little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.    The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.    But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he  never caught a cold!      He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain,  splashing in the pond--    \"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my  dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I will  invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The  Alderman, however, eats salad.\"    Mr. Jeremy put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his  rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept  his boat.    The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was  tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.    Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. \"I  know a good place for minnows,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.    Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He  had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his  line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm  at the end.    The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the  float.    \"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,\" said Mr.  Jeremy Fisher.    He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of  his basket.    \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,\" said  Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the  toe of one of his goloshes.    Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating  his sandwich.    Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst  the rushes at the side of the pond.    \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had better  get away from here.\"    Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the  bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous  bobbit!    \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher,  jerking up his rod.    But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy  landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!    The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he  was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.    And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at  Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking  his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a _much_ worse thing  happened; a really _frightful_ thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had  not been wearing a macintosh!    A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--and  it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned and  dived down to the bottom of the pond!    But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in  less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it  swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.    Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the  bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the  edge of the pond.    He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across  the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.    \"What a mercy that was not a pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have lost  my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should  never have dared to go fishing again!\"    He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to  dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his  larder.    Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat,    And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string  bag.    And instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper  with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_  think it must have been nasty!

Printed and bound in Great Britain by  William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London    _for_    THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE                  OF NEWLANDS    [Illustration]    Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm  called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always losing  her pocket-handkerchiefs!    One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!  \"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have _you_ seen  them, Tabby Kitten?\"    [Illustration]    The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--    \"Sally Henny-penny, have _you_ found three pocket-handkins?\"    But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--    \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"        [Illustration]    And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.    Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew  over a stile and away.    Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind  Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no  top!    And a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things  spread upon the grass.    [Illustration]    Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she  ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away  down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    [Illustration]    Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.    Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the  water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup!  And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a  _very_ small person.    Lucie ran on, and on.    [Illustration]    The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there  were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes,  and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!    But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside  it some one was singing--        \"Lily-white and clean, oh!       With little frills between, oh!        Smooth and hot--red rusty spot       Never here be seen, oh!\"    [Illustration]    Lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened  voice called out \"Who's that?\"    Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a  nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any  other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly  touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything  there.    [Illustration]    There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her  hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.    Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her  striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle,  and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie  had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!    [Illustration]    \"Who are you?\" said Lucie. \"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?\"    The little person made a bob-curtsey--\"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name  is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent  clear-starcher!\" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and  spread it on the ironing-blanket.    [Illustration]    \"What's that thing?\" said Lucie--\"that's not my pocket-handkin?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to  Cock Robin!\"    And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    [Illustration]    Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--    \"That isn't my pinny?\" said Lucie.    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny  Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\"  said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    [Illustration]    Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went  twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    [Illustration]    \"There's one of my pocket-handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's my pinny!\"    Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.    \"Oh that _is_ lovely!\" said Lucie.    [Illustration]    \"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"    \"Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how  she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go  barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    [Illustration]    \"Why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it _did_  so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the  smell.\"    \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.    [Illustration]    \"What are those funny little white things?\"    \"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron  them; she washes them herself.\"    \"There's my last pocket-handkin!\" said Lucie.    [Illustration]    \"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\"    \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most  terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \"Now I've finished my  ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"    [Illustration]    \"What are these dear soft fluffy things?\" said Lucie.    \"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"    \"Will their jackets take off?\" asked Lucie.    \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And  here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.  They're _always_ marked at washing!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    [Illustration]    And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice;  and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail  belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging  to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the  washing--and at last the basket was empty!    [Illustration]    \"Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.  They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and  very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her  cap, there were _hair-pins_ sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't  like to sit too near her.    [Illustration]    When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and  Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and  fastened with a silver safety-pin.    And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the  door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    [Illustration]    Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the  bundles of clothes!    All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet  them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!    [Illustration]    And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and  birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    [Illustration]    So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was  nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.    [Illustration]    Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she  turned to say \"Good-night,\" and to thank the washer-woman--But what a  _very_ odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or  for the washing bill!    She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white  frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    [Illustration]    And _how_ small she had grown--and _how_ brown--and covered with PRICKLES!    Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.           *       *       *       *       *        (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the      stile--but then how could she have found three clean      pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?        And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill      called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with      dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)"]]]
