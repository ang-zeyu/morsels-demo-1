For an instant the dancers paused, and in the silence of the interval  there rose from the lips of the fast-bound white man an answering  shriek, more fearsome and more terrible than that of the jungle-beast  that had roused it.    For several minutes the blacks hesitated; then, at the urging of Rokoff  and their chief, they leaped in to finish the dance and the victim; but  ere ever another spear touched the brown hide a tawny streak of  green-eyed hate and ferocity bounded from the door of the hut in which  Tarzan had been imprisoned, and Sheeta, the panther, stood snarling  beside his master.    For an instant the blacks and the whites stood transfixed with terror.  Their eyes were riveted upon the bared fangs of the jungle cat.    Only Tarzan of the Apes saw what else there was emerging from the dark  interior of the hut.          Chapter 9    Chivalry or Villainy      From her cabin port upon the Kincaid, Jane Clayton had seen her husband  rowed to the verdure-clad shore of Jungle Island, and then the ship  once more proceeded upon its way.    For several days she saw no one other than Sven Anderssen, the  Kincaid's taciturn and repellent cook.  She asked him the name of the  shore upon which her husband had been set.    \"Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard,\" replied the Swede, and that  was all that she could get out of him.    She had come to the conclusion that he spoke no other English, and so  she ceased to importune him for information; but never did she forget  to greet him pleasantly or to thank him for the hideous, nauseating  meals he brought her.    Three days from the spot where Tarzan had been marooned the Kincaid  came to anchor in the mouth of a great river, and presently Rokoff came  to Jane Clayton's cabin.    \"We have arrived, my dear,\" he said, with a sickening leer.   \"I have  come to offer you safety, liberty, and ease.  My heart has been  softened toward you in your suffering, and I would make amends as best  I may.    \"Your husband was a brute--you know that best who found him naked in  his native jungle, roaming wild with the savage beasts that were his  fellows.  Now I am a gentleman, not only born of noble blood, but  raised gently as befits a man of quality.    \"To you, dear Jane, I offer the love of a cultured man and association  with one of culture and refinement, which you must have sorely missed  in your relations with the poor ape that through your girlish  infatuation you married so thoughtlessly.   I love you, Jane.  You have  but to say the word and no further sorrows shall afflict you--even your  baby shall be returned to you unharmed.\"    Outside the door Sven Anderssen paused with the noonday meal he had  been carrying to Lady Greystoke.  Upon the end of his long, stringy  neck his little head was cocked to one side, his close-set eyes were  half closed, his ears, so expressive was his whole attitude of stealthy  eavesdropping, seemed truly to be cocked forward--even his long,  yellow, straggly moustache appeared to assume a sly droop.    As Rokoff closed his appeal, awaiting the reply he invited, the look of  surprise upon Jane Clayton's face turned to one of disgust.  She fairly  shuddered in the fellow's face.    \"I would not have been surprised, M.  Rokoff,\" she said, \"had you  attempted to force me to submit to your evil desires, but that you  should be so fatuous as to believe that I, wife of John Clayton, would  come to you willingly, even to save my life, I should never have  imagined.  I have known you for a scoundrel, M.  Rokoff; but until now  I had not taken you for a fool.\"    Rokoff's eyes narrowed, and the red of mortification flushed out the  pallor of his face.  He took a step toward the girl, threateningly.    \"We shall see who is the fool at last,\" he hissed, \"when I have broken  you to my will and your plebeian Yankee stubbornness has cost you all  that you hold dear--even the life of your baby--for, by the bones of  St.  Peter, I'll forego all that I had planned for the brat and cut its  heart out before your very eyes.  You'll learn what it means to insult  Nikolas Rokoff.\"    Jane Clayton turned wearily away.    \"What is the use,\" she said, \"of expatiating upon the depths to which  your vengeful nature can sink?  You cannot move me either by threats or  deeds.  My baby cannot judge yet for himself, but I, his mother, can  foresee that should it have been given him to survive to man's estate  he would willingly sacrifice his life for the honour of his mother.  Love him as I do, I would not purchase his life at such a price.   Did  I, he would execrate my memory to the day of his death.\"    Rokoff was now thoroughly angered because of his failure to reduce the  girl to terror.  He felt only hate for her, but it had come to his  diseased mind that if he could force her to accede to his demands as  the price of her life and her child's, the cup of his revenge would be  filled to brimming when he could flaunt the wife of Lord Greystoke in  the capitals of Europe as his mistress.    Again he stepped closer to her.  His evil face was convulsed with rage  and desire.  Like a wild beast he sprang upon her, and with his strong  fingers at her throat forced her backward upon the berth.    At the same instant the door of the cabin opened noisily.   Rokoff  leaped to his feet, and, turning, faced the Swede cook.    Into the fellow's usually foxy eyes had come an expression of utter  stupidity.  His lower jaw drooped in vacuous harmony.   He busied  himself in arranging Lady Greystoke's meal upon the tiny table at one  side of her cabin.    The Russian glared at him.    \"What do you mean,\" he cried, \"by entering here without permission?  Get out!\"    The cook turned his watery blue eyes upon Rokoff and smiled vacuously.    \"Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard,\" he said, and then he began  rearranging the few dishes upon the little table.    \"Get out of here, or I'll throw you out, you miserable blockhead!\"  roared Rokoff, taking a threatening step toward the Swede.    Anderssen continued to smile foolishly in his direction, but one  ham-like paw slid stealthily to the handle of the long, slim knife that  protruded from the greasy cord supporting his soiled apron.    Rokoff saw the move and stopped short in his advance.   Then he turned  toward Jane Clayton.    \"I will give you until tomorrow,\" he said, \"to reconsider your answer  to my offer.  All will be sent ashore upon one pretext or another  except you and the child, Paulvitch and myself.   Then without  interruption you will be able to witness the death of the baby.\"    He spoke in French that the cook might not understand the sinister  portent of his words.  When he had done he banged out of the cabin  without another look at the man who had interrupted him in his sorry  work.    When he had gone, Sven Anderssen turned toward Lady Greystoke--the  idiotic expression that had masked his thoughts had fallen away, and in  its place was one of craft and cunning.    \"Hay tank Ay ban a fool,\" he said.  \"Hay ben the fool.  Ay savvy  Franch.\"    Jane Clayton looked at him in surprise.    \"You understood all that he said, then?\"    Anderssen grinned.    \"You bat,\" he said.    \"And you heard what was going on in here and came to protect me?\"    \"You bane good to me,\" explained the Swede.  \"Hay treat me like darty  dog.  Ay help you, lady.  You yust vait--Ay help you.  Ay ban Vast  Coast lots times.\"    \"But how can you help me, Sven,\" she asked, \"when all these men will be  against us?\"    \"Ay tank,\" said Sven Anderssen, \"it blow purty soon purty hard,\" and  then he turned and left the cabin.    Though Jane Clayton doubted the cook's ability to be of any material  service to her, she was nevertheless deeply grateful to him for what he  already had done.  The feeling that among these enemies she had one  friend brought the first ray of comfort that had come to lighten the  burden of her miserable apprehensions throughout the long voyage of the  Kincaid.    She saw no more of Rokoff that day, nor of any other until Sven came  with her evening meal.  She tried to draw him into conversation  relative to his plans to aid her, but all that she could get from him  was his stereotyped prophecy as to the future state of the wind.  He  seemed suddenly to have relapsed into his wonted state of dense  stupidity.    However, when he was leaving her cabin a little later with the empty  dishes he whispered very low, \"Leave on your clothes an' roll up your  blankets.  Ay come back after you purty soon.\"    He would have slipped from the room at once, but Jane laid her hand  upon his sleeve.    \"My baby?\" she asked.  \"I cannot go without him.\"    \"You do wot Ay tal you,\" said Anderssen, scowling.   \"Ay ban halpin'  you, so don't you gat too fonny.\"    When he had gone Jane Clayton sank down upon her berth in utter  bewilderment.  What was she to do?  Suspicions as to the intentions of  the Swede swarmed her brain.  Might she not be infinitely worse off if  she gave herself into his power than she already was?    No, she could be no worse off in company with the devil himself than  with Nikolas Rokoff, for the devil at least bore the reputation of  being a gentleman.    She swore a dozen times that she would not leave the Kincaid without  her baby, and yet she remained clothed long past her usual hour for  retiring, and her blankets were neatly rolled and bound with stout  cord, when about midnight there came a stealthy scratching upon the  panels of her door.    Swiftly she crossed the room and drew the bolt.  Softly the door swung  open to admit the muffled figure of the Swede.   On one arm he carried  a bundle, evidently his blankets.   His other hand was raised in a  gesture commanding silence, a grimy forefinger upon his lips.    He came quite close to her.    \"Carry this,\" he said.  \"Do not make some noise when you see it.

It is only in the young mother that the pelvic bones give way  slightly to the pressure on them by the foetus. It can be readily  understood, that when the young is large in proportion to the diameter of  the pelvic inlet, it is difficult for it to pass through. This occurs when  mothers belonging to a small breed, are impregnated by a sire belonging to  a large breed of animals. It may also occur if the mother is fed too  fattening a ration and not permitted sufficient exercise.    The part of the foetus that presents itself for entrance into the pelvic  cavity and its position are of the greatest importance in giving birth to  the young. Either end of the foetus, or its middle portion may be presented  for entrance. The _anterior_ and _posterior presentations_ may be modified  by the position that the foetus assumes. It may be in a position that  places the back or vertebrae opposite the upper portion of the inlet, or  the floor or sides of the pelvic cavity. These positions may be modified by  the position of one or both limbs, or the head and neck being directed  forwards instead of backwards. In the _transverse presentations_, the back,  or the feet and abdomen of the foetus may present themselves for entrance  to the pelvic cavity. These presentations may show three positions each.  The head may be opposite the upper walls of the inlet, the foetus assuming  a dog-sitting position, or it may lie on either side.    In order to overcome the friction between the foetus and the wall of the  maternal passages, these parts are lubricated by the fluids that escape  from the \"water bags.\" If birth is prolonged and the passages become dry,  birth is retarded. The hair offers some resistance in a posterior  presentation. Young mares that become hysterical have abnormal labor pains  that seem to hold the foetus in the womb instead of expelling it.    CARE OF THE MOTHER AND YOUNG.--Although birth is generally easy in the  different domestic animals, it may be difficult and complicated, and it is  of the greatest economic importance that special attention be given the  mother at this time. It is very necessary for her to be free if confined in  a stall. If running in a pasture or lot, the necessary shelter from storms,  cold or extreme heat should be provided. Other farm animals, such as hogs,  horses and cattle, should not be allowed to run in the same lot or pasture.    When parturition commences, the mother should be kept under close  observation. If the labor is difficult and prolonged, we may then examine  the parts and determine the cause of the abnormal birth. Unnecessary  meddling is not advisable. Before attempting this examination, the hands  should be cleaned and disinfected, and the finger nails shortened if  necessary. The different conditions to be determined are the nature of the  labor pains, the condition of the maternal passages, and the position and  presentation of the foetus. In the smaller animals this examination may be  difficult. In prolonged labor the parts may be found dry and the labor  pains violent and irregular, or weak. The foetus may be jammed tightly into  the pelvic inlet, it may be well forward in the womb, the head and fore or  hind limbs may be directed backwards, or one or more of these parts may be  directed forward in such a position as to prevent the entrance of the  foetus into the pelvic inlet. Sometimes the foetus is in a transverse  position. The parts that present themselves at the pelvic inlet should be  carefully examined and their position determined. The necessary assistance  should then be given. Any delay in assisting in the birth may result in the  death of the young or mother, or both. On the other hand, unintelligent  meddling may aggravate the case and render treatment difficult or  impossible. There is no line of veterinary work that requires the attention  of a skilled veterinarian more than assisting an irregular or abnormal  birth.    The attendant must guard against infecting the parts with irritating germs,  or irritating and injuring them in any way. The hands, instruments, and  cords must be freed from germs by washing with a disinfectant, or  sterilization with heat. The quarters must be clean in order to prevent  contamination of the instruments and clothing of the attendant by filth.  Extreme force is injurious. For illustration, we may take a case of  difficult birth caused by an unusually large foetus. Both presentation and  position are normal, the forefeet and head having entered the pelvic  cavity, but the shoulders and chest are jammed tightly in the inlet, and  the progress of the foetus along the maternal passages is retarded. By  using sufficient force, we may succeed in delivering the young, but by  pulling on one limb until the shoulder has entered the pelvis, and  repeating this with the opposite limb we are able to deliver the young  without exposing the mother to injury. It may be necessary to change an  abnormal presentation, or position, to a normal presentation, or as nearly  normal as possible. This should be done before any attempt is made to  remove the foetus.    Following birth the mother should not be unnecessarily disturbed. The  quarters should be clean, well bedded and ventilated, but free from  draughts. If the parturition has been normal, a small quantity of easily  digested feed may be fed. If weak and feverish, feed should be withheld for  at least twelve hours. The mare should be rested for a few weeks. The young  needs no special attention if it is strong and vigorous, but if weak, it  may be necessary to support it while nursing, or milk the mother and feed  it by hand. If the mother is nervous and irritable, it may be necessary to  remove the young temporarily to a place where she can hear and see it,  until a time when she can be induced to care for it. The principal  attention required for young pigs is protection against being crushed by  the mother. The cutting off and ligation of the umbilical cord at a point a  few inches from the abdomen, and applying tincture of iodine or any  reliable disinfectant is very advisable in the colt and calf.    RETENTION OF THE FETAL MEMBRANES.--The foetus is enveloped by several  layers of membranes. The _external envelope, the chorion_, is exactly  adapted to the uterus. The _innermost envelope, the amnion_, encloses the  foetus. Covering the external face of the amnion and lining the inner face  of the chorion is a double membrane, _the allantois_. The envelopes  mentioned are not the only protection that the foetus has against injury.  It is enveloped in fluids as well. Immediately surrounding it is the  _liquor amnii_, and within allantois is the _allantoic fluid._    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Placenta of cow.]    _The placenta_ is a highly vascular structure spread out or scattered over  the surface of the chorion and the mucous membrane of the uterus, that  attaches the foetus and its envelopes to the womb (Fig. 19). It is by means  of this vascular apparatus that the foetus is furnished with nourishment.  The fetal and maternal placentas are made up of vascular villi and  depressions that are separated only by the thin walls of capillaries, and a  layer of epithelial cells. This permits a change of material between the  fetal and maternal circulation. The arrangement of the placenta differs in  the different species. In the mare and sow, the villi are diffused. In  ruminants, the villi are grouped at certain points. These vascular masses  are termed cotyledons. The maternal cotyledons or \"buttons\" form appendages  or thickened points that become greatly enlarged in the pregnant animal.    Toward the end of the pregnant period, the attachments between the fetal  and maternal placentulae undergo a fatty degeneration and finally separate.  This results in contractions of the muscular wall of the uterus, and the  expulsion of the foetus and its envelopes. In the mare, it is not uncommon  for the colt to be born with the covering intact. This does not occur in  the cow. Usually the envelopes are not expelled until a short time after  birth in all animals, and it is not uncommon for them to be retained. This  complication is most commonly met with in the cow.    In the mare the _retention of the fetal envelopes_ or \"afterbirth\" is  commonly due to the muscles of the womb not contracting properly following  birth. Abortion, especially the infectious form, is commonly complicated by  a retention of the fetal membranes. Any condition that may produce an  inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb may result in retention of  the \"after-birth.\" Injuries to the uterus resulting from the animal  slipping, fighting and becoming crowded are, no doubt, common causes of  failure to \"clean\" in cows.    _The symptoms_ are so marked that a mistaken diagnosis is seldom made. A  portion of the membranes is usually seen hanging from the vulva, and the  tail and hind parts may be more or less soiled. The latter symptom is  especially prominent if the membranes have been retained for several days,  and decomposition has begun. In such case, the discharge from the vulva is  dark in color, contains small pieces of the decomposed membrane and has a  very disagreeable odor. In the mare, acute inflammation of the womb may  result if the removal of the \"after-birth\" is neglected. Loss of appetite,  abnormal body temperature, weakness and diarrhoea may follow. Such cases  usually terminate in death. Retention of the fetal membranes is a very  common cause of leucorrhoea.    _The treatment_ consists in removing the fetal envelopes before there is  any opportunity for them to undergo decomposition. In the mare, this should  be practised within a few hours after birth has occurred, and in other  animals, from one to forty-eight hours. In warm stables and during the warm  weather, treatment should not be postponed later than twenty-four hours.  The only successful method of treatment is to"]]]
