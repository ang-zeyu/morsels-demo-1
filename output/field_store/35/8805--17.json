The others redoubled their efforts.  The crashing of their blades upon  mine raised a terrific din that might have been heard for miles through  the silent night.  Sparks flew as steel smote steel, and then there was  the dull and sickening sound of a shoulder bone parting beneath the  keen edge of my Martian sword.    Three now faced me, but the girl was working her way to a point that  would soon permit her to reduce the number by one at least.  Then  things happened with such amazing rapidity that I can scarce comprehend  even now all that took place in that brief instant.    The three rushed me with the evident purpose of forcing me back the few  steps that would carry my body over the rail into the void below.  At  the same instant the girl fired and my sword arm made two moves.  One  man dropped with a bullet in his brain; a sword flew clattering across  the deck and dropped over the edge beyond as I disarmed one of my  opponents and the third went down with my blade buried to the hilt in  his breast and three feet of it protruding from his back, and falling  wrenched the sword from my grasp.    Disarmed myself, I now faced my remaining foeman, whose own sword lay  somewhere thousands of feet below us, lost in the Lost Sea.    The new conditions seemed to please my adversary, for a smile of  satisfaction bared his gleaming teeth as he rushed at me bare-handed.  The great muscles which rolled beneath his glossy black hide evidently  assured him that here was easy prey, not worth the trouble of drawing  the dagger from his harness.    I let him come almost upon me.  Then I ducked beneath his outstretched  arms, at the same time sidestepping to the right.  Pivoting on my left  toe, I swung a terrific right to his jaw, and, like a felled ox, he  dropped in his tracks.    A low, silvery laugh rang out behind me.    \"You are no thern,\" said the sweet voice of my companion, \"for all your  golden locks or the harness of Sator Throg.  Never lived there upon all  Barsoom before one who could fight as you have fought this night.  Who  are you?\"    \"I am John Carter, Prince of the House of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of  Helium,\" I replied.  \"And whom,\" I added, \"has the honour of serving  been accorded me?\"    She hesitated a moment before speaking.  Then she asked:    \"You are no thern.  Are you an enemy of the therns?\"    \"I have been in the territory of the therns for a day and a half.  During that entire time my life has been in constant danger.  I have  been harassed and persecuted.  Armed men and fierce beasts have been  set upon me.  I had no quarrel with the therns before, but can you  wonder that I feel no great love for them now?  I have spoken.\"    She looked at me intently for several minutes before she replied.  It  was as though she were attempting to read my inmost soul, to judge my  character and my standards of chivalry in that long-drawn, searching  gaze.    Apparently the inventory satisfied her.    \"I am Phaidor, daughter of Matai Shang, Holy Hekkador of the Holy  Therns, Father of Therns, Master of Life and Death upon Barsoom,  Brother of Issus, Prince of Life Eternal.\"    At that moment I noticed that the black I had dropped with my fist was  commencing to show signs of returning consciousness.  I sprang to his  side.  Stripping his harness from him I securely bound his hands behind  his back, and after similarly fastening his feet tied him to a heavy  gun carriage.    \"Why not the simpler way?\" asked Phaidor.    \"I do not understand.  What 'simpler way'?\" I replied.    With a slight shrug of her lovely shoulders she made a gesture with her  hands personating the casting of something over the craft's side.    \"I am no murderer,\" I said.  \"I kill in self-defence only.\"    She looked at me narrowly.  Then she puckered those divine brows of  hers, and shook her head.  She could not comprehend.    Well, neither had my own Dejah Thoris been able to understand what to  her had seemed a foolish and dangerous policy toward enemies.  Upon  Barsoom, quarter is neither asked nor given, and each dead man means so  much more of the waning resources of this dying planet to be divided  amongst those who survive.    But there seemed a subtle difference here between the manner in which  this girl contemplated the dispatching of an enemy and the  tender-hearted regret of my own princess for the stern necessity which  demanded it.    I think that Phaidor regretted the thrill that the spectacle would have  afforded her rather than the fact that my decision left another enemy  alive to threaten us.    The man had now regained full possession of his faculties, and was  regarding us intently from where he lay bound upon the deck.  He was a  handsome fellow, clean limbed and powerful, with an intelligent face  and features of such exquisite chiselling that Adonis himself might  have envied him.    The vessel, unguided, had been moving slowly across the valley; but now  I thought it time to take the helm and direct her course.  Only in a  very general way could I guess the location of the Valley Dor.  That it  was far south of the equator was evident from the constellations, but I  was not sufficiently a Martian astronomer to come much closer than a  rough guess without the splendid charts and delicate instruments with  which, as an officer in the Heliumite Navy, I had formerly reckoned the  positions of the vessels on which I sailed.    That a northerly course would quickest lead me toward the more settled  portions of the planet immediately decided the direction that I should  steer.  Beneath my hand the cruiser swung gracefully about.  Then the  button which controlled the repulsive rays sent us soaring far out into  space.  With speed lever pulled to the last notch, we raced toward the  north as we rose ever farther and farther above that terrible valley of  death.    As we passed at a dizzy height over the narrow domains of the therns  the flash of powder far below bore mute witness to the ferocity of the  battle that still raged along that cruel frontier.  No sound of  conflict reached our ears, for in the rarefied atmosphere of our great  altitude no sound wave could penetrate; they were dissipated in thin  air far below us.    It became intensely cold.  Breathing was difficult.  The girl, Phaidor,  and the black pirate kept their eyes glued upon me.  At length the girl  spoke.    \"Unconsciousness comes quickly at this altitude,\" she said quietly.  \"Unless you are inviting death for us all you had best drop, and that  quickly.\"    There was no fear in her voice.  It was as one might say: \"You had  better carry an umbrella.  It is going to rain.\"    I dropped the vessel quickly to a lower level.  Nor was I a moment too  soon.  The girl had swooned.    The black, too, was unconscious, while I, myself, retained my senses, I  think, only by sheer will.  The one on whom all responsibility rests is  apt to endure the most.    We were swinging along low above the foothills of the Otz.  It was  comparatively warm and there was plenty of air for our starved lungs,  so I was not surprised to see the black open his eyes, and a moment  later the girl also.    \"It was a close call,\" she said.    \"It has taught me two things though,\" I replied.    \"What?\"    \"That even Phaidor, daughter of the Master of Life and Death, is  mortal,\" I said smiling.    \"There is immortality only in Issus,\" she replied.  \"And Issus is for  the race of therns alone.  Thus am I immortal.\"    I caught a fleeting grin passing across the features of the black as he  heard her words.  I did not then understand why he smiled.  Later I was  to learn, and she, too, in a most horrible manner.    \"If the other thing you have just learned,\" she continued, \"has led to  as erroneous deductions as the first you are little richer in knowledge  than you were before.\"    \"The other,\" I replied, \"is that our dusky friend here does not hail  from the nearer moon--he was like to have died at a few thousand feet  above Barsoom.  Had we continued the five thousand miles that lie  between Thuria and the planet he would have been but the frozen memory  of a man.\"    Phaidor looked at the black in evident astonishment.    \"If you are not of Thuria, then where?\" she asked.    He shrugged his shoulders and turned his eyes elsewhere, but did not  reply.    The girl stamped her little foot in a peremptory manner.    \"The daughter of Matai Shang is not accustomed to having her queries  remain unanswered,\" she said.  \"One of the lesser breed should feel  honoured that a member of the holy race that was born to inherit life  eternal should deign even to notice him.\"    Again the black smiled that wicked, knowing smile.    \"Xodar, Dator of the First Born of Barsoom, is accustomed to give  commands, not to receive them,\" replied the black pirate.  Then,  turning to me, \"What are your intentions concerning me?\"    \"I intend taking you both back to Helium,\" I said.  \"No harm will come  to you.  You will find the red men of Helium a kindly and magnanimous  race, but if they listen to me there will be no more voluntary  pilgrimages down the river Iss, and the impossible belief that they  have cherished for ages will be shattered into a thousand pieces.\"    \"Are you of Helium?\" he asked.    \"I am a Prince of the House of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium,\" I  replied, \"but I am not of Barsoom.  I am of another world.\"    Xodar looked at me intently for a few moments.    \"I can well believe that you are not of Barsoom,\" he said at length.  \"None of this world could have bested eight of the First Born  single-handed.  But how is it that you wear the golden hair and the  jewelled circlet of a Holy Thern?\"  He emphasized the word holy with a  touch of irony.    \"I had forgotten them,\" I said.  \"They are the spoils of conquest,\" and  with a sweep of my hand I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#15)"],[1,"the surgeon, he immediately dressed the wound in  his haunch or buttock, and found the bullet had only grazed upon the  flesh, and passed, as it were, by it, but it was not lodged in the part,  so that it was soon healed and well again; but, as to his arm, he found  one of the bones broken, which are in the fore-part from the wrist to  the elbow; and this he set, and splintered it up, and bound his arm in a  sling, hanging it about his neck, and making signs to him that he should  not stir it; which he was so strict an observer of, that he set him  down, and never moved one way or other but as the surgeon gave him  leave.    I took a great deal of pains to acquaint this negro what we intended  to do, and what use we intended to make of his men; and particularly  to teach him the meaning of what we said, especially to teach him some  words, such as yes and no, and what they meant, and to inure him to  our way of talking; and he was very willing and apt to learn anything I  taught him.    It was easy to let him see that we intended to carry our provision with  us from the first day; but he made signs to us to tell us we need not,  for we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It was  very difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty; for he  knew no figures, but some words that they used to one another that they  understood it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty  little stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel,  and find provisions sufficient.    Then I showed him our baggage, which was very heavy, particularly our  powder, shot, lead, iron, carpenters' tools, seamen's instruments, cases  of bottles, and other lumber. He took some of the things up in his hand  to feel the weight, and shook his head at them; so I told our people  they must resolve to divide their things into small parcels, and make  them portable; and accordingly they did so, by which means we were fain  to leave all our chests behind us, which were eleven in number.    Then he made signs to us that he would procure some buffaloes, or young  bulls, as I called them, to carry things for us, and made signs, too,  that if we were weary, we might be carried too; but that we slighted,  only were willing to have the creatures, because, at last, when they  could serve us no farther for carriage, we might eat them all up if we  had any occasion for them.    I then carried him to our bark, and showed him what things we had here.  He seemed amazed at the sight of our bark, having never seen anything  of that kind before, for their boats are most wretched things, such as  I never saw before, having no head or stern, and being made only of the  skins of goats, sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep, and  done over with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil, but of a most  nauseous, odious smell; and they are poor miserable things for boats,  the worst that any part of the world ever saw; a canoe is an excellent  contrivance compared to them.    But to return to our boat. We carried our new prince into it, and helped  him over the side, because of his lameness. We made signs to him that  his men must carry our goods for us, and showed him what we had; he  answered, \"Si, Seignior,\" or, \"Yes, sir\" (for we had taught him that  word and the meaning of it), and taking up a bundle, he made signs to  us, that when his arm was well he would carry some for us.    I made signs again to tell him, that if he would make his men carry  them, we would not let him carry anything. We had secured all the  prisoners in a narrow place, where we had bound them with mat cords, and  set up stakes like a palisado round them; so, when we carried the prince  on shore, we went with him to them, and made signs to him to ask them if  they were willing to go with us to the country of lions. Accordingly he  made a long speech to them, and we could understand by it that he told  them, if they were willing, they must say, \"Si, Seignior,\" telling  them what it signified. They immediately answered, \"Si, Seignior,\" and  clapped their hands, looking up to the sun, which, the prince signified  to us, was swearing to be faithful. But as soon as they had said so, one  of them made a long speech to the prince; and in it we perceived, by his  gestures, which were very antic, that they desired something from us,  and that they were in great concern about it. So I asked him, as well as  I could, what it was they desired of us; he told us by signs that they  desired we should clap our hands to the sun (that was, to swear) that we  would not kill them, that we would give them chiaruck, that is to say,  bread, would not starve them, and would not let the lions eat them.  I told him we would promise all that; then he pointed to the sun, and  clapped his hands, signing to me that I should do so too, which I did;  at which all the prisoners fell flat on the ground, and rising up again,  made the oddest, wildest cries that ever I heard.    I think it was the first time in my life that ever any religious thought  affected me; but I could not refrain some reflections, and almost tears,  in considering how happy it was that I was not born among such creatures  as these, and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous; but this soon  went off again, and I was not troubled again with any qualms of that  sort for a long time after.    When this ceremony was over, our concern was to get some provisions,  as well for the present subsistence of our prisoners as ourselves; and  making signs to our prince that we were thinking upon that subject, he  made signs to me that, if I would let one of the prisoners go to his  town, he should bring provisions, and should bring some beasts to carry  our baggage. I seemed loth to trust him, and supposing that he would  run away, he made great signs of fidelity, and with his own hands tied a  rope about his neck, offering me one end of it, intimating that I should  hang him if the man did not come again. So I consented, and he gave him  abundance of instructions, and sent him away, pointing to the light of  the sun, which it seems was to tell him at what time he must be back.    The fellow ran as if he was mad, and held it till he was quite out of  sight, by which I supposed he had a great way to go. The next morning,  about two hours before the time appointed, the black prince, for so I  always called him, beckoning with his hand to me, and hallooing after  his manner, desired me to come to him, which I did, when, pointing to a  little hill about two miles off, I saw plainly a little drove of cattle,  and several people with them; those, he told me by signs, were the man  he had sent, and several more with him, and cattle for us.    Accordingly, by the time appointed, he came quite to our huts, and  brought with him a great many cows, young runts, about sixteen goats,  and four young bulls, taught to carry burthens.    This was a supply of provisions sufficient; as for bread, we were  obliged to shift with some roots which we had made use of before. We  then began to consider of making some large bags like the soldiers'  knapsacks, for their men to carry our baggage in, and to make it easy  to them; and the goats being killed, I ordered the skins to be spread  in the sun, and they were as dry in two days as could be desired; so we  found means to make such little bags as we wanted, and began to divide  our baggage into them. When the black prince found what they were for,  and how easy they were of carriage when we put them on, he smiled a  little, and sent away the man again to fetch skins, and he brought two  natives more with him, all loaded with skins better cured than ours, and  of other kinds, such as we could not tell what names to give them.    These two men brought the black prince two lances, of the sort they use  in their fights, but finer than ordinary, being made of black smooth  wood, as fine as ebony, and headed at the point with the end of a long  tooth of some creature--we could not tell of what creature; the head was  so firm put on, and the tooth so strong, though no bigger than my thumb,  and sharp at the end, that I never saw anything like it in any place in  the world.    The prince would not take them till I gave him leave, but made signs  that they should give them to me; however, I gave him leave to take them  himself, for I saw evident signs of an honourable just principle in him.    We now prepared for our march, when the prince coming to me, and  pointing towards the several quarters of the world, made signs to know  which way we intended to go; and when I showed him, pointing to the  west, he presently let me know there was a great river a little further  to the north, which was able to carry our bark many leagues into the  country due west. I presently took the hint, and inquired for the mouth  of the river, which I understood by him was above a day's march, and, by  our estimation, we found it about seven leagues further. I take this to  be the great river marked by our chart-makers at the northmost part of  the coast of Mozambique, and called there Quilloa.    Consulting thus with ourselves, we resolved to take the prince, and as  many of the prisoners as we could stow in our frigate, and go about  by the bay into the river; and that eight of us, with our arms, should  march by land to meet them on the river side; for the prince, carrying  us to a rising ground, had showed us the river very plain, a great way  up the country, and in one place it was not above six miles to it.    It was my lot to march by land, and be captain of the whole caravan.  I had eight of our men with me, and seven-and-thirty of our prisoners,  without any baggage, for all our luggage was yet on board. We drove the  young bulls with us; nothing was ever so tame, so willing to work, or  carry anything. The negroes would ride upon them four at a time, and  they would go very willingly. They"]]]
