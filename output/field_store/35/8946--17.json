The five pounds!\"    Mike was not always abreast of the rustic idea of humor, and now he felt  particularly fogged. For the life of him he could not see what there was  to amuse anyone so much in the fact that a person who owed five pounds  was ready to pay it back. It was an occasion for rejoicing, perhaps, but  rather for a solemn, thankful, eyes-raised-to-heaven kind of rejoicing.    \"What's up?\" he asked.    \"Five pounds!\"    \"You might tell us the joke.\"    Mr. Barley opened the letter, read it, and had another attack; when this  was finished he handed the letter to Mike, who was waiting patiently by,  hoping for light, and requested him to read it.    \"Dear, dear!\" chuckled Mr. Barley, \"five pounds! They may teach you  young gentlemen to talk Latin and Greek and what-not at your school, but  it 'ud do a lot more good if they'd teach you how many beans make five;  it 'ud do a lot more good if they'd teach you to come in when it rained;  it 'ud do ...\"    Mike was reading the letter.    \"Dear Mr. Barley,\" it ran.    \"I send the L5, which I could not get before. I hope it is in time,  because I don't want you to write to the headmaster. I am sorry Jane and  John ate your wife's hat and the chicken and broke the vase.\"    There was some more to the same effect; it was signed \"T.G. Jellicoe.\"    \"What on earth's it all about?\" said Mike, finishing this curious  document.    Mr. Barley slapped his leg. \"Why, Mr. Jellicoe keeps two dogs here; I  keep 'em for him till the young gentlemen go home for their holidays.  Aberdeen terriers, they are, and as sharp as mustard. Mischief! I  believe you, but, love us! they don't do no harm! Bite up an old shoe  sometimes and such sort of things. The other day, last Wednesday it  were, about 'ar parse five, Jane--she's the worst of the two, always up  to it, she is--she got hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you  could say knife. John upset a china vase in one of the bedrooms chasing  a mouse, and they got on the coffee-room table and ate half a cold  chicken what had been left there. So I says to myself, 'I'll have a game  with Mr. Jellicoe over this,' and I sits down and writes off saying the  little dogs have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not, and  the damage'll be five pounds, and will he kindly remit same by Saturday  night at the latest or I write to his headmaster. Love us!\" Mr. Barley  slapped his thigh, \"he took it all in, every word--and here's the five  pounds in cash in this envelope here! I haven't had such a laugh since  we got old Tom Raxley out of bed at twelve of a winter's night by  telling him his house was afire.\"    It is not always easy to appreciate a joke of the practical order if one  has been made even merely part victim of it. Mike, as he reflected that  he had been dragged out of his house in the middle of the night, in  contravention of all school rules and discipline, simply in order to  satisfy Mr. Barley's sense of humor, was more inclined to be abusive  than mirthful. Running risks is all very well when they are necessary,  or if one chooses to run them for one's own amusement, but to be placed  in a dangerous position, a position imperiling one's chance of going to  the 'Varsity, is another matter altogether.    But it is impossible to abuse the Barley type of man. Barley's enjoyment  of the whole thing was so honest and childlike. Probably it had given  him the happiest quarter of an hour he had known for years, since, in  fact, the affair of old Tom Raxley. It would have been cruel to damp  the man.    So Mike laughed perfunctorily, took back the envelope with the five  pounds, accepted a ginger beer and a plateful of biscuits, and rode off  on his return journey.           *       *       *       *       *    Mention has been made above of the difference which exists between  getting into an inn after lockup and into a private house. Mike was to  find this out for himself.    His first act on arriving at Sedleigh was to replace his bicycle in the  shed. This he accomplished with success. It was pitch-dark in the shed,  and as he wheeled his machine in, his foot touched something on the  floor. Without waiting to discover what this might be, he leaned his  bicycle against the wall, went out, and locked the door, after which he  ran across to Outwood's.    Fortune had favored his undertaking by decreeing that a stout drainpipe  should pass up the wall within a few inches of his and Psmith's study.  On the first day of term, it may be remembered he had wrenched away the  wooden bar which bisected the window frame, thus rendering exit and  entrance almost as simple as they had been for Wyatt during Mike's first  term at Wrykyn.    He proceeded to scale this water pipe.    He had got about halfway up when a voice from somewhere below cried,  \"Who's that?\"        16    PURSUIT      These things are Life's Little Difficulties. One can never tell  precisely how one will act in a sudden emergency. The right thing for  Mike to have done at this crisis was to have ignored the voice, carried  on up the water pipe, and through the study window, and gone to bed. It  was extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognized him at night  against the dark background of the house. The position then would have  been that somebody in Mr. Outwood's house had been seen breaking in  after lights-out; but it would have been very difficult for the  authorities to have narrowed the search down any further than that.  There were thirty-four boys in Outwood's, of whom about fourteen were  much the same size and build as Mike.    The suddenness, however, of the call caused Mike to lose his head. He  made the strategic error of sliding rapidly down the pipe, and running.    There were two gates to Mr. Outwood's front garden. The drive ran in a  semicircle, of which the house was the center. It was from the  right-hand gate, nearest to Mr. Downing's house, that the voice had  come, and, as Mike came to the ground, he saw a stout figure galloping  toward him from that direction. He bolted like a rabbit for the other  gate. As he did so, his pursuer again gave tongue.    \"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" was the exact remark.    Whereby Mike recognized him as the school sergeant. \"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" was  that militant gentleman's habitual way of beginning a conversation.    With this knowledge, Mike felt easier in his mind. Sergeant Collard was  a man of many fine qualities (notably a talent for what he was wont to  call \"spott'n,\" a mysterious gift which he exercised on the rifle  range), but he could not run. There had been a time in his hot youth  when he had sprinted like an untamed mustang in pursuit of volatile  Pathans in Indian hill wars, but Time, increasing his girth, had taken  from him the taste for such exercise. When he moved now it was at a  stately walk. The fact that he ran tonight showed how the excitement of  the chase had entered into his blood.    \"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" he shouted again, as Mike, passing through the gate,  turned into the road that led to the school. Mike's attentive ear noted  that the bright speech was a shade more puffily delivered this time. He  began to feel that this was not such bad fun after all. He would have  liked to be in bed, but, if that was out of the question, this was  certainly the next-best thing.    He ran on, taking things easily, with the sergeant panting in his wake,  till he reached the entrance to the school grounds. He dashed in and  took cover behind a tree.    Presently the sergeant turned the corner, going badly and evidently  cured of a good deal of the fever of the chase. Mike heard him toil on  for a few yards and then stop. A sound of panting was borne to him.    Then the sound of footsteps returning, this time at a walk. They passed  the gate and went on down the road.    The pursuer had given the thing up.    Mike waited for several minutes behind his tree. His program now was  simple. He would give Sergeant Collard about half an hour, in case the  latter took it into his head to \"guard home\" by waiting at the gate.  Then he would trot softly back, shoot up the water pipe once more, and  so to bed. It had just struck a quarter to something--twelve, he  supposed--on the school clock. He would wait till a quarter past.    Meanwhile, there was nothing to be gained from lurking behind a tree. He  left his cover, and started to stroll in the direction of the pavilion.  Having arrived there, he sat on the steps, looking out onto the  cricket field.    His thoughts were miles away, at Wrykyn, when he was recalled to  Sedleigh by the sound of somebody running. Focusing his gaze, he saw a  dim figure moving rapidly across the cricket field straight for him.    His first impression, that he had been seen and followed, disappeared as  the runner, instead of making for the pavilion, turned aside, and  stopped at the door of the bicycle shed. Like Mike, he was evidently  possessed of a key, for Mike heard it grate in the lock. At this point  he left the pavilion and hailed his fellow rambler by night in a  cautious undertone.    The other appeared startled.    \"Who the dickens is that?\" he asked. \"Is that you, Jackson?\"    Mike recognized Adair's voice. The last person he would have expected to  meet at midnight obviously on the point of going for a bicycle ride.    \"What are you doing out here. Jackson?\"    \"What are you, if it comes to that?\"    Adair was adjusting his front light.    \"I'm going for the doctor. One of the chaps in our house is bad.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"What are you doing out here?\"    \"Just been for a stroll.\"    \"Hadn't you better be getting back?\"    \"Plenty of time.\"    \"I suppose you think you're doing something tremendously brave and  dashing?\"    \"Hadn't you better be going to the doctor?\"    \"If you want to know what I think--\"    \"I don't. So long.\"    Mike turned away, whistling between his teeth. After a moment's pause,  Adair rode off."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10598"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume I.

He was a merry droll in those times, and a man so addicted to  pleasure, that as Winstanley observes, he drank much deeper draughts  of sack, than of the Heliconian stream; he was amongst the first of  our poets who writ for bread, and in order the better to support  himself, tho' he lived in an age far from being dissolute, viz. in  that of the renowned Queen Elizabeth; yet he had recourse to the mean  expedient of writing obscenity, and favouring the cause of vice, by  which he no doubt recommended himself to the rakes about town, who, as  they are generally no true judges of wit, to estimate the merit of  a piece, as it happens to suit their appetite, or encourage them in  every irregular indulgence. No man of honour who sees a poet endowed  with a large share of natural understanding, prostituting his pen to  the vilest purpose of debauchery and lewdness, can think of him but  with contempt; and his wit, however brilliant, ought not to screen him  from the just indignation of the sober part of mankind. When wit is  prostituted to vice, 'tis wit no more; that is, it ceases to be true  wit; and I have often thought there should be some public mark of  infamy fixed on those who hurt society by loose writings. But Mr.  Green must be freed from the imputation of hypocrisy, for we find him  practicing the very doctrines he taught. Winstanley relates that he  was married to a very fine and deserving lady, whom he basely forsook,  with a child she had by him, for the company of some harlots, to whom  he applied the wages of iniquity, while his wife starved. After some  years indulgence of this sort, when his wit began to grow stale, we  find him fallen into abject poverty, and lamenting the life he had led  which brought him to it; for it always happens, that a mistress is a  more expensive piece of furniniture than a wife; and if the modern  adulterers would speak the truth, I am certain they would acknowledge,  that half the money which, in the true sense of the word, is misspent  upon those daughters of destruction, would keep a family with decency,  and maintain a wife with honour. When our author was in this forlorn  miserable state, he writ a letter to his wife, which Mr. Winstanly has  preferred, and which, as it has somewhat tender in it I shall insert.  It has often been observed, that half the unhappy marriages in the  world, are more owing to the men than the women; That women are in  general much better beings, in the moral sense, than the men; who,  as they bustle less in life, are generally unacquainted with those  artifices and tricks, which are acquired by a knowledge of the world;  and that then their yoke-fellows need only be tender and indulgent, to  win them. But I believe it may be generally allowed, that women are  the best or worst part of the human creation: none excel them in  virtue; but when they depart from it, none exceed them in vice. In the  case of Green, we shall see by the letter he sent his wife how much  she was injured.      \"The remembrance of many wrongs offered    thee, and thy unreproved virtues, add greater    sorrow to my miserable state than I can utter,    or thou conceive; neither is it lessened by consideration    of thy absence, (tho' shame would    let me hardly behold thy face) but exceedingly    aggravated, for that I cannot as I ought to thy ownself    reconcile myself, that thou might'st witness my    inward woe at this instant, that hath made thee a    woful wife for so long a time. But equal heaven has    denied that comfort, giving at my last need, like    succour as I have sought all my life, being in    this extremity as void of help, as thou hast been    of hope. Reason would that after so long waste,    I should not send thee a child to bring thee    charge; but consider he is the fruit of thy    womb, in whose face regard not the father, so    much as thy own perfections: He is yet green,    and may grow strait, if he be carefully tended,    otherwise apt enough to follow his father's folly.    That I have offended thee highly, I know;    that thou canst forget my injuries, I hardly believe;    yet I perswade myself, that if thou sawest    my wretched estate, thou couldst not but lament    it, nay certainly I know, thou wouldst. All thy    wrongs muster themselves about me, and every    evil at once plagues me; for my contempt of    God, I am contemned of men; for my swearing    and forswearing, no man will believe me;    for my gluttony, I suffer hunger; for my    drunkenness, thirst; for my adultery, ulcerous    sores. Thus God hath cast me down that I    might be humbled, and punished for example    of others; and though he suffers me in this    world to perish without succour, yet I trust in the    world to come, to find mercy by the merits of    my Saviour, to whom I commend thee, and commit    my soul.\"      Thy repentant husband,      for his disloyalty,      ROBERT GREEN.    This author's works are chiefly these,    The Honourable History of Fryar Bacon, and Fryar Bungy; play'd by the  Prince of Palatine's servants. I know not whence our author borrowed  his plot, but this famous fryar Minor lived in the reign of Henry III.  and died in the reign of Edward I. in the year 1284. He joined with  Dr. Lodge in one play, called a Looking Glass for London; he writ also  the Comedies of Fryar Bacon and Fair Enome. His other pieces are, Quip  for an upstart Courtier, and Dorastus and Fawnia. Winstanley imputes  likewise to him the following pieces. Tully's Loves; Philomela, the  Lady Fitzwater's Nightingale; Green's News too Late, first and second  part; Green's Arcadia; Green's Farewel to Folly; Green's Groatsworth  of Wit.    It is said by Wood in his Fasti, p. 137, vol. i. that our author died  in the year 1592, of a surfeit taken by eating pickled herrings, and  drinking with them rhenish wine. At this fatal banquet, Thomas Nash,  his cotemporary at Cambridge was with him, who rallies him in his  Apology of Pierce Pennyless. Thus died Robert Green, whose end may  be looked upon as a kind of punishment for a life spent in riot and  infamy.           *       *       *       *       *      EDMUND SPENSER    was born in London, and educated at Pembroke Hall in Cambridge. The  accounts of the birth and family of this great man are but obscure and  imperfect, and at his first setting out into life, his fortune and  interest seem to have been very inconsiderable.    After he had for some time continued at the college, and laid that  foundation of learning, which, joined to his natural genius, qualified  him to rise to so great an excellency, he stood for a fellowship,  in competition with Mr. Andrews, a gentleman in holy orders, and  afterwards lord bishop of Winchester, in which he was unsuccessful.  This disappointment, joined with the narrowness of his circumstances,  forced him to quit the university [1]; and we find him next residing  at the house of a friend in the North, where he fell in love with his  Rosalind, whom he finely celebrates in his pastoral poems, and of  whose cruelty he has written such pathetical complaints.    It is probable that about this time Spenser's genius began first to  distinguish itself; for the Shepherd's Calendar, which is so full of  his unprosperous passion for Rosalind, was amongst the first of  his works of note, and the supposition is strengthened, by the  consideration of Poetry's being frequently the offspring of love  and retirement. This work he addressed by a short dedication to the  Maecenas of his age, the immortal Sir Philip Sidney. This gentleman was  now in the highest reputation, both for wit and gallantry, and the  most popular of all the courtiers of his age, and as he was himself a  writer, and especially excelled in the fabulous or inventive part of  poetry; it is no wonder he was struck with our author's genius, and  became sensible of his merit. A story is told of him by Mr. Hughes,  which I shall present the reader, as it serves to illustrate the great  worth and penetration of Sidney, as well as the excellent genius of  Spenser. It is said that our poet was a"]]]
