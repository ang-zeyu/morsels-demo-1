And do you s'pose she's really in the fire?\"    \"You shut up and go along!\" cried Arline roughly, under the stress of her  own fears. \"How in time's anybody going to tell, that's twenty miles away?\"    She left the street and went hurrying through back yards and across vacant  lots, crawled through a wire fence, and so reached, without any roundabout  method, the trail which led to the top of the bluff, where the whole town  was breathlessly assembling. Her flat-chested, un-corseted figure merged  into the haze as she half trotted up the steep road, swinging her arms like  a man, her skirts flapping in the wind. As she went, she kept muttering to  herself:    \"If she really is caught by the fire--and her alone--and Man more'n half  drunk--\" She whirled, and stood waiting for the horseman who was galloping  up the trail behind her. \"You going home, Man? You don't think it could  git to your place, do you?\" She shouted the questions at him as he pounded  past.    Manley, sallow white with terror, shook his head vaguely and swung his  heavy quirt down upon the flanks of his horse. Arline lowered her head  against the dust kicked into her face as he went tearing past her, and  kept doggedly on. Some one came rattling up behind her with empty barrels  dancing erratically in a wagon, and she left the trail to make room. The  hostler from their own stable it was who drove, and at the creek ahead of  them he stopped to fill the barrels. Arline passed him by and kept on.    At the brow of the hill the women and children were gathered in a  whimpering group. Arline joined them and gazed out over the prairie, where  the smoke was rolling toward them, and, lifting here and there, let a flare  of yellow through.    \"It'll show up fine at dark,\" a fat woman in a buggy remarked. \"There's  nothing grander to look at than a prairie fire at night. I do hope,\" she  added weakly, \"it don't do no great damage!\"    \"Oh, it won't,\" Arline cut in, with savage sarcasm, panting from her climb.  \"It's bound to sweep the hull country slick an' clean, and maybe burn us  all out--but that won't matter, so long as it looks purty after dark!\"    \"They say it's a good ten mile away yet,\" another woman volunteered  encouragingly. \"They'll git it stopped, all right. There's lots of men here  to fight it, thank goodness!\"    Arline moved on to where a plow was being hurriedly unloaded from a wagon,  the horses hitched to it, and a man already grasping the handles in an  aggressive manner. As she came up he went off, yelling his opinions and  turning a shallow, uneven furrow for a back fire. Within five minutes  another plow was tearing up the sod in an opposite direction.    \"If it jumps here, or they can't turn it, the creek'll help a lot,\" some  one was yelling.    The plowed furrows lengthened, the horses sweating and throwing their heads  up and down with the discomfort of the pace they must keep. Whiplashes  whistled and the drivers urged them on with much shouting. Blumenthall, cut  off, with his men, from reaching his own ranch, was directing a group  about to set a back fire. His voice boomed as if he were shouting across a  milling herd. A roll of his eye brought his attention momentarily from the  work, and he ran toward a horseman who was gesticulating wildly and seemed  on the point of riding straight toward the fire.    \"Hi! Fleetwood, we need you here!\" he yelled. \"You can't get home now, and  you know it. The fire's past your place already; you'd have to ride through  it, you fool! Hey? Your wife home alone--_alone!_\"    He stood absolutely still and stared out to the southwest, where the smoke  cloud was rolling closer with every breath. He drew his fingers across his  forehead and glanced at the men around him, also stunned into inactivity by  the tragedy behind the words.    \"Well--get to work, men. We've got to save the town. Fine time to burn  guards--when a fire's loping up on you! But that's the way it goes,  generally. This ought to've been done a month ago. Put it off and put it  off--while they haggle over bids--Brinberg, you and I'll string the fire.  The rest of you watch it don't jump back. And, say!\" he shouted to the  group around Manley. \"Don't let that crazy fool start off now. Put him to  work. Best thing for him. But--my God, that's awful!\" He did not shout the  last sentence. He spoke so that only the nearest man heard him--heard, and  nodded dumb assent.    Manley raged, sitting helpless there upon his horse. They would not let him  ride out toward that sweeping wave of fire. He could not have gone five  miles toward home before he met the flames. He stood in the stirrups  and shook his fists impotently. He strained his eyes to see what it was  impossible for him to see--his ranch and Val, and how they had fared. He  pictured mentally the guard he had burned beyond the coulee to protect them  from just this danger, and his heart squeezed tight at the realization of  his own shiftlessness. That guard! A twelve-foot strip of half-burned sod,  with tufts of grass left standing here and there--and he had meant to burn  it wider, and had put it off from day to day, until now. _Now!_    His clenched fist dropped upon the saddle horn, and he stared dully at the  rushing, rolling smoke and fire. It was not _that_ he saw--it was Val, with  cinder-blackened ruffles, grimy face, and yellow hair falling in loose  locks upon her cheeks--locks which she must stop to push out of her eyes,  so that she could see where to swing the sodden sack while she helped  him--him, Manley, who had permitted her to do work it for none but a man's  hard muscles, so that he might finish the sooner and ride to town upon some  flimsy pretext. And he could not even reach her now--or the place where she  had been!    The group had thinned around him, for there was something to do besides  give sympathy to a man bereaved. Unless they bestirred themselves, they  might all be in need of sympathy before the day was done. Manley took his  eyes from the coming fire and glanced around him, saw that he was alone,  and, with a despairing oath, wheeled his horse and raced back down the hill  to town, as if fiends rode behind the saddle.    At the saloon opposite the Hawley Hotel he drew up; rather, his horse  stopped there of his own accord, as if he were quite at home at that  particular hitching pole. Manley dismounted heavily and lurched inside. The  place was deserted save for Jim, who was paid to watch the wares of his  employer, and was now standing upon a chair at the window, that he might  see over the top of Hawley's coal shed and glimpse the hilltop beyond. Jim  stepped down and came toward him.    \"How's the fire?\" he demanded anxiously. \"Think she'll swing over this  way?\"    But Manley had sunk into a chair and buried his face in his arms, folded  upon a whisky-spotted card table.    \"Val--my Val!\" he wailed, \"Back there alone--get me a drink,\" he added  thickly, \"or I'll go crazy!\"    Jim hastily poured a full glass, and stood over him anxiously.    \"Here it is. Drink 'er down, and brace up. What you mean? Is your wife--\"    Manley lifted his head long enough to gulp the whisky, then dropped it  again upon his arms and groaned.          CHAPTER IX. KENT TO THE RESCUE    The fire had been burning a possible half-hour when Kent, jogging aimlessly  toward a log ridge with the lazy notion of riding to the top and taking  a look at the country to the west before returning to the ranch, first  smelled the stronger tang of burned grass and swung instinctively into the  wind. He galloped to higher ground, and, trained by long watching of the  prairie to detect the smoke of a nearer fire in the haze of those long  distant, saw at once what must have happened, and knew also the danger. His  horse was fresh, and he raced him over the uneven prairie toward the blaze.    It was tearing straight across the high ground between Dry Creek and Cold  Spring Coulee when he first saw it plainly, and he altered his course  a trifle. The roar of it came faintly on the wind, like the sound of  storm-beaten surf pounding heavily upon a sand bar when the tide is out,  except that this roar was continuous, and was full of sharp cracklings and  sputterings; and there was also the red line of flame to visualize the  sound.    When his eyes first swept the mile-long blaze, he felt his helplessness,  and cursed aloud the man who had drawn all the fighting force from the  prairie that day. They might at least have been able to harry it and hamper  it and turn the savage sweep of it into barren ground upon some rock-bound  coulee's rim. If they could have caught it at the start, or even in the  first mile of its burning--or, even now, if Blumenthall's outfit were on  the spot--or if Manley Fleetwood's fire guards held it back--He hoped some  of them had stayed at home, so that they could help fight it.    In that brief glimpse before he rode down into a hollow and so lost sight  of it, he knew that the fire they had fought and vanquished before had been  a puny blaze compared with this one. The ground it had burned was not broad  enough to do more than check this fire temporarily. It would simply burn  around the blackened area and rush on and on, until the bend of the river  turned it back to the north, where the river's first tributary stream would  stop it for good and all. But before that happened it would have done its  worst--and its worst was enough to pale the face of every prairie dweller.    Once more he caught sight of the fire as he was riding swiftly across  the level land to the east of Cold Spring Coulee. He was going to see if  Manley's fire guards were any good, and if anyone was there ready to fight  it when it came up; they could set a back fire from the guards, he thought,  even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#15)"],[1,"sense.  The expressions \"Our        Father\" and \"Our Father which is in Heaven\" are found        frequently in the Jewish Prayer-book.  On this subject,        consult Taylor, _Sayings_, pp. 124, 176, and G. Friedlander,        _The Jewish Sources of the Sermon on the Mount_, chapter X.

It seems that originally _Abot_ ended here, as in the        _Machzor Vitry_.  The verses which follow were added from        other sources.  See Bacher, _Agada der Tanaiten_, I, 378;        Taylor, _ibid._, p. 95, n. 46, p. 96, n. 47; Hoffmann, _Die        erste Mischna_, p. 30; _idem_, _Abot_, p. 358, notes 106 and        108; and Strack, _Spruche_, p. 46, notes _t_ and _u_.          (60) Taylor makes this verse an _addendum_ to chapter V, and        calls it \"The Ages of Man.\"  Cf. Shakespeare's \"Seven Ages of        Man.\"  See in the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Ages of Man in        Jewish Literature_, _The Seven_, and Schechter, _Studies_, I,        pp. 299-300.          (61) The _Mishnah_ is the oral or unwritten law based on the        written law contained in the Pentateuch (see chapter I, n. 1).         The _Mishnah_, _par excellence_, is the codification made by        Judah ha-Nasi (see chapter II, n. 1).  It is divided into six        orders or sections known as _sedarim_.  They are (1) _Zeraim_,        \"seeds,\" which contains the laws regarding the cultivation of        the land and its products, introduced by a treatise concerning        prayer and benedictions (_Berachot_); (2) _Mode_, \"festivals,\"        treating of the laws of the Sabbath and the festivals; (3)        _Nashim_, \"women,\" regulations concerning marriage and        divorce; (4) _Nezikin_, \"injuries\" or \"damages,\" civil and        criminal law; (5) _Kodashim_, \"holy things,\" the laws of        sacrifice and of the service of the Temple; and (6) _Tohorot_,        \"purifications,\" dealing with the clean and the unclean.  Each        order is subdivided into treatises (_massektot_), there being        in all 63 such subdivisions.  The _Mishnah_ is known as the        _shas_ ([shin''samech]), which word is formed from the first        letters of the words _shishah sedarim_ (six orders).  The        _Talmud_ is also similarly termed.  For a discussion of the        name, origin, contents, compilation, etc., of the _Mishnah_,        see Mielziner, _Introduction to the Talmud_, p. 4 _et seq._;        art. _Mishnah_, in the _Jewish Encyclopedia_ and the        authorities cited there; Strack, _Einleitung_, p. 2, 15 _et        seq._, 22 _et seq._, and Geiger, _Judaism and its History_, p.        239 _et seq._          (62) At thirteen, the Jewish boy becomes _bar mitzwah_,        _i.e._, \"a son of commandment.\"  The rites and ceremonies        connected with the _bar mitzwah_ of to-day cannot \"be clearly        traced earlier than the fourteenth century\" (Abrahams, _Jewish        Life in the Middle Ages_, p. 32).  See Schurer, _History_, II,        ii, p. 53 and n. 38; Schechter, _Studies_, I, p. 306 _et        seq._, and art. _Bar Mitzwah_, in _Jewish Encyclopedia_.

Some texts read, \"for the study of the _Gemara_.\"  The        _Gemara_ (from the Aramaic, meaning \"learning,\" \"completion\")        is a collection of explanations and discussions on the        _Mishnah_.  The word _Talmud_ was afterwards applied to the        _Mishnah_ plus the _Gemara_.  There is a translation of the        _Talmud_ in English by Rodkinson, but it is free and        incomplete in parts.  See Meilziner, _Introduction to the        Talmud_; Bacher, art. _Talmud_, in _Jewish Encyclopedia_;        _idem_, art. _Gemara_, in the _Hebrew Union College Annual_        (Cincinnati, 1904); E.

Num. I, 3, and Deut. XXIV, 5; _Machzor        Vitri_, p. 551.  Shakespeare's \"Then a soldier\"); (3) the age        \"to pursue him for his deeds,\" for the celestial _bet din_        (tribunal) does not punish at an age less than twenty        (Bartenora's second explanation; cf. Rashi on Num. XVI, 27);        (4) for the pursuit of ideals (Taylor); (5) to pursue the        commandments (_Siddur Korban Minchah_).          (65) Cf. Ps. XC, 10.    25.

Ben He He said, \"According to the labor is the reward\" (67).          (67) The last two verses are ascribed by _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_        to Hillel (chapter XII, ed. Schechter, p. 55).  Ben Bag Bag        and Ben He He were probably proselytes and disciples of        Hillel.  See Bacher, _ibid._, pp. 10-12, Taylor and Hoffmann,        _ad loc._, and _Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Ben Bag Bag_.    Rabbi Chanania, the son of Akashia, said, \"The Holy One, blessed be  He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore He gave them a  copious _Torah_ and many commandments, as it is said, 'It pleased the  Lord, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the _Torah_ and make it  honorable'\".                CHAPTER VI    THE ACQUISITION OF THE TORAH (1)          (1) See Introduction pp. 18-19. [refers to the end of the        section titled DEVELOPMENT OF ABOT]    All Israel have a portion in the world to come, and it is said, \"And  thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for  ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be  glorified\".    The sages taught (the following) in the language of the  _Mishnah_--blessed be He that made choice of them and their _Mishnah_.   1. R. Meir (2) said, \"Whosoever labors in the _Torah_ for its own  sake merits many things; and not only so, but the whole world is  indebted to him: he is called friend, beloved, a lover of the  All-present, a lover of mankind: it clothes him with meekness and  reverence; it fits him to become just, pious, upright, and faithful;  it keeps him far from sin, and brings him near to virtue; through him  are enjoyed counsel and sound knowledge, understanding and strength,  as it is said, 'Counsel is mind, and sound knowledge; I am  understanding; I have strength' (3).  It gives him sovereignty and  dominion and discerning judgment; to him the secrets of the _Torah_  are revealed; he is made like a never-failing spring and like a river  that flows on with ever-increasing vigor; he becomes modest,  long-suffering, and forgiving of insults; and it magnifies and exalts  him above all things.\"          (2) Chapter III, n. 32.          (3) Prov. VIII, 14.  Wisdom, representing the _Torah_, utters        these words.    2. R. Joshua, the son of Levi (4), said, \"Every day a _bat-kol_ (5)  goes forth from Mount Horeb, proclaiming and saying, 'Woe to mankind  for contempt of the _Torah_, for whoever does not occupy himself in  the _Torah_ is said to be under the divine censure, as it is said, 'As  a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman who turneth  aside from discretion' (6); and it says, 'And the tables were the work  of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the  tables' (7).  Read not _charut_ (8), but _cherut_ (9), for no man is  free but he who occupies himself in the learning of _Torah_.  But  whosoever labors in the _torah_, behold he shall be exalted, as it is  said, 'And from _Mattanah_ to _Nachaliel_, and from _Nachaliel_ to  _Bamot_'\" (10).          (4) R. Joshua lived about the middle of the third century.          (5) _Bat kol_ (lit., \"daughter of a voice\" or        \"daughter-voice\"), \"a small voice,\" \"sound,\" \"resonance,\" not        \"echo,\" as it is often translated.  The expression _bat kol_        was used in place of the longer one _bat kol min ha-shamayim_,        which is \"a heavenly or divine voice which proclaims God's        will or judgment, His deeds, and His commandments to        individuals or to number of persons, to rulers, countries, and        even to whole nations.\"  This celestial voice was a means of        divine revelation lower than that of prophecy.  According to        Schechter, it has two peculiar features: first, its messages        are reproductions of verses or sentences from the Old        Testament or from the Apocrypha, and secondly, \"it is audible        only to those who are prepared to hear it.\"  See Weber,        _Altsynag. Theol._, pp. 187-189; Low, _Gesammelte Schriften_,        II, p. 58, n. 1; Kitto's _Cyclopedia of Biblical Lit._, art.        _Bath Kil_, and _Ludwig Blau_, art. _Bat Kol_, in _Jewish        Encyclopedia_.

The word [nazaf (nun-zayin-fey)]        \"censured,\" \"placed under ban,\" by a form of Rabbinical        interpretation known as _notarikon_ (stenographer's method,        abbreviation), is connected with the words of this verse in        Proverbs: [Nezem Zahav b'aF (NUN-zayin-mem(sofit)        ZAYIN-hey-bet bet-alef-FEY(sofit), capitals indicating larger        case Hebrew letters)].  Another instance of this kind of        interpretation is in connecting the word [anochi] \"I,\" the        first word of the Decalogue, with the phrase: [Ana Nafshi"]]]
