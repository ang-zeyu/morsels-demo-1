For three months in the year the environs of Pernambuco are animated  beyond description. From November to March the weather is particularly  fine; then it is that rich and poor, young and old, foreigners and  natives, all issue from the city to enjoy the country till Lent  approaches, when back they hie them. Villages and hamlets, where  nothing before but rags was seen, now shine in all the elegance of  dress; every house, every room, every shed become eligible places for  those whom nothing but extreme necessity could have forced to live  there a few weeks ago: some join in the merry dance, others saunter up  and down the orange groves; and towards evening the roads become a  moving scene of silk and jewels. The gaming-tables have constant  visitors: there thousands are daily and nightly lost and won--parties  even sit down to try their luck round the outside of the door as well  as in the room:      Vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus aulae    Luctus et ultrices, posucre sedilia curae.    About six or seven miles from Pernambuco stands a pretty little village  called Monteiro. The river runs close by it, and its rural beauties  seem to surpass all others in the neighbourhood. There the  Captain-General of Pernambuco resides during this time of merriment and  joy.    The traveller who allots a portion of his time to peep at his  fellow-creatures in their relaxations, and accustoms himself to read  their several little histories in their looks and gestures as he goes  musing on, may have full occupation for an hour or two every day at  this season amid the variegated scenes around the pretty village of  Monteiro. In the evening groups sitting at the door, he may sometimes  see with a sigh how wealth and the prince's favour cause a booby to  pass for a Solon, and be reverenced as such, while perhaps a poor  neglected Camoens stands silent at a distance, awed by the dazzling  glare of wealth and power. Retired from the public road he may see poor  Maria sitting under a palm-tree, with her elbow in her lap and her head  leaning on one side within her hand, weeping over her forbidden bans.  And as he moves on \"with wandering step and slow,\" he may hear a  broken-hearted nymph ask her faithless swain:      How could you say my face was fair,      And yet that face forsake?    How could you win my virgin heart,      Yet leave that heart to break?    One afternoon, in an unfrequented part not far from Monteiro, these  adventures were near being brought to a speedy and a final close: six  or seven blackbirds, with a white spot betwixt the shoulders, were  making a noise and passing to and fro on the lower branches of a tree  in an abandoned, weed-grown orange-orchard. In the long grass  underneath the tree apparently a pale green grasshopper was fluttering,  as though it had got entangled in it. When you once fancy that the  thing you are looking at is really what you take it for, the more you  look at it the more you are convinced it is so. In the present case  this was a grasshopper beyond all doubt, and nothing more remained to  be done but to wait in patience till it had settled, in order that you  might run no risk of breaking its legs in attempting to lay hold of it  while it was fluttering--it still kept fluttering; and having quietly  approached it, intending to make sure of it --behold, the head of a  large rattlesnake appeared in the grass close by: an instantaneous  spring backwards prevented fatal consequences. What had been taken for  a grasshopper was, in fact, the elevated rattle of the snake in the act  of announcing that he was quite prepared, though unwilling, to make a  sure and deadly spring. He shortly after passed slowly from under the  orange-tree to the neighbouring wood on the side of a hill: as he moved  over a place bare of grass and weeds he appeared to be about eight feet  long; it was he who had engaged the attention of the birds and made  them heedless of danger from another quarter: they flew away on his  retiring--one alone left his little life in the air, destined to become  a specimen, mute and motionless, for the inspection of the curious in a  far distant clime.    It was now the rainy season. The birds were moulting--fifty-eight  specimens of the handsomest of them in the neighbourhood of Pernambuco  had been collected; and it was time to proceed elsewhere. The  conveyance to the interior was by horses, and this mode, together with  the heavy rains, would expose preserved specimens to almost certain  damage. The journey to Maranham by land would take at least forty days.  The route was not wild enough to engage the attention of an explorer,  or civilised enough to afford common comforts to a traveller. By sea  there were no opportunities, except slave-ships. As the transporting  poor negroes from port to port for sale pays well in Brazil, the ships'  decks are crowded with them. This would not do.    Excuse here, benevolent reader, a small tribute of gratitude to an  Irish family whose urbanity and goodness have long gained it the esteem  and respect of all ranks in Pernambuco. The kindness and attention I  received from Dennis Kearney, Esq., and his amiable lady will be  remembered with gratitude to my dying day.    After wishing farewell to this hospitable family, I embarked on board a  Portuguese brig, with poor accommodations, for Cayenne in Guiana. The  most eligible bedroom was the top of a hen-coop on deck. Even here an  unsavoury little beast, called bug, was neither shy nor deficient in  appetite.    The Portuguese seamen are famed for catching fish. One evening, under  the line, four sharks made their appearance in the wake of the vessel.  The sailors caught them all.    On the fourteenth day after leaving Pernambuco, the brig cast anchor  off the Island of Cayenne. The entrance is beautiful. To windward, not  far off, there are two bold wooded islands called the Father and  Mother, and near them are others, their children, smaller, though as  beautiful as their parents. Another is seen a long way to leeward of  the family, and seems as if it had strayed from home and cannot find  its way back. The French call it \"l'enfant perdu.\" As you pass the  islands the stately hills on the main, ornamented with ever-verdant  foliage, show you that this is by far the sublimest scenery on the  sea-coast from the Amazons to the Oroonoque. On casting your eye  towards Dutch Guiana you will see that the mountains become unconnected  and few in number, and long before you reach Surinam the Atlantic wave  washes a flat and muddy shore.    Considerably to windward of Cayenne, and about twelve leagues from  land, stands a stately and towering rock called the Constable. As  nothing grows on it to tempt greedy and aspiring man to claim it as his  own, the sea-fowl rest and raise their offspring there. The bird called  the frigate is ever soaring round its rugged summit. Hither the phaeton  bends his rapid flight, and flocks of rosy flamingos here defy the  fowler's cunning. All along the coast, opposite the Constable, and  indeed on every uncultivated part of it to windward and leeward, are  seen innumerable quantities of snow-white egrets, scarlet curlews,  spoonbills and flamingos.    Cayenne is capable of being a noble and productive colony. At present  it is thought to be the poorest on the coast of Guiana. Its estates are  too much separated one from the other by immense tracts of forest; and  the revolutionary war, like a cold eastern wind, has chilled their zeal  and blasted their best expectations.    The clove-tree, the cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg, and many other choice  spices and fruits of the Eastern and Asiatic regions, produce  abundantly in Cayenne.    The town itself is prettily laid out, and was once well fortified. They  tell you it might easily have been defended against the invading force  of the two united nations; but Victor Hugues, its governor, ordered the  tri-coloured flag to be struck; and ever since that day the standard of  Braganza has waved on the ramparts of Cayenne.    He who has received humiliations from the hand of this haughty,  iron-hearted governor may see him now, in Cayenne, stripped of all his  revolutionary honours, broken down and ruined, and under arrest in his  own house. He has four accomplished daughters, respected by the whole  town. Towards the close of day, when the sun's rays are no longer  oppressive, these much-pitied ladies are seen walking up and down the  balcony with their aged parent, trying, by their kind and filial  attention, to remove the settled gloom from his too guilty brow.    This was not the time for a traveller to enjoy Cayenne. The hospitality  of the inhabitants was the same as ever, but they had lost their wonted  gaiety in public, and the stranger might read in their countenances, as  the recollection of recent humiliations and misfortunes every now and  then kept breaking in upon them, that they were still in sorrow for  their fallen country: the victorious hostile cannon of Waterloo still  sounded in their ears: their emperor was a prisoner amongst the hideous  rocks of St. Helena; and many a Frenchman who had fought and bled for  France was now amongst them begging for a little support to prolong a  life which would be forfeited on the parent soil. To add another  handful to the cypress and wormwood already scattered amongst these  polite colonists, they had just received orders from the Court of  Janeiro to put on deep mourning for six months, and half-mourning for  as many more, on account of the death of the queen of Portugal.    About a day's journey in the interior is the celebrated national  plantation. This spot was judiciously chosen, for it is out of the  reach of enemies' cruisers. It is called La Gabrielle. No plantation in  the Western world can vie with La Gabrielle.

The instrument is now being used  for investigating these variations; and in the year 1907 as many as  1,545 observations of stars were made with the reflex zenith tube.    In connection with zenith telescopes it must be stated that Respighi,  at the Capitol Observatory at Rome, made use of a deep well with a  level mercury surface at the bottom and a telescope at the top  pointing downwards, which the writer saw in 1871. The reflection of  the micrometer wires and of a star very near the zenith (but not quite  in the zenith) can be observed together.  His mercury trough was a  circular plane surface with a shallow edge to retain the mercury. The  surface quickly came to rest after disturbance by street traffic.    Sir W. M. H. Christie, Eighth Astronomer Royal, took up his duties in  that capacity in 1881. Besides a larger altazimuth that he erected in  1898, he has widened the field of operations at Greenwich by the  extensive use of photography and the establishment of large  equatoreals.  From the point of view of instruments of precision, one  of the most important new features is the astrographic equatoreal, set  up in 1892 and used for the Greenwich section of the great  astrographic chart just completed. Photography has come to be of use,  not only for depicting the sun and moon, comets and nebulae, but also  to obtain accurate relative positions of neighbouring stars; to pick  up objects that are invisible in any telescope; and, most of all  perhaps, in fixing the positions of faint satellites. Thus Saturn's  distant satellite, Phoebe, and the sixth and seventh satellites of  Jupiter, have been followed regularly in their courses at Greenwich  ever since their discovery with the thirty-inch reflector (erected in  1897); and while doing so Mr. Melotte made, in 1908, the splendid  discovery on some of the photographic plates of an eighth satellite of  Jupiter, at an enormous distance from the planet. From observations in  the early part of 1908, over a limited arc of its orbit, before  Jupiter approached the sun, Mr. Cowell computed a retrograde orbit and  calculated the future positions of this satellite, which enabled  Mr. Melotte to find it again in the autumn--a great triumph both of  calculation and of photographic observation. This satellite has never  been seen, and has been photographed only at Greenwich, Heidelberg,  and the Lick Observatory.    Greenwich Observatory has been here selected for tracing the progress  of accurate measurement. But there is one instrument of great value,  the heliometer, which is not used at Greenwich. This serves the  purpose of a double image micrometer, and is made by dividing the  object-glass of a telescope along a diameter. Each half is mounted so  as to slide a distance of several inches each way on an arc whose  centre is the focus. The amount of the movement can be accurately  read. Thus two fields of view overlap, and the adjustment is made to  bring an image of one star over that of another star, and then to do  the same by a displacement in the opposite direction. The total  movement of the half-object glass is double the distance between the  star images in the focal plane. Such an instrument has long been  established at Oxford, and German astronomers have made great use of  it. But in the hands of Sir David Gill (late His Majesty's Astronomer  at the Cape of Good Hope), and especially in his great researches on  Solar and on Stellar parallax, it has been recognised as an instrument  of the very highest accuracy, measuring the distance between stars  correctly to less than a tenth of a second of arc.    The superiority of the heliometer over all other devices (except  photography) for measuring small angles has been specially brought  into prominence by Sir David Gill's researches on the distance of the  sun--_i.e.,_ the scale of the solar system. A measurement of the  distance of any planet fixes the scale, and, as Venus approaches the  earth most nearly of all the planets, it used to be supposed that a  Transit of Venus offered the best opportunity for such measurement,  especially as it was thought that, as Venus entered on the solar disc,  the sweep of light round the dark disc of Venus would enable a very  precise observation to be made.  The Transit of Venus in 1874, in  which the present writer assisted, overthrew this delusion.    In 1877 Sir David Gill used Lord Crawford's heliometer at the Island  of Ascension to measure the parallax of Mars in opposition, and found  the sun's distance 93,080,000 miles. He considered that, while the  superiority of the heliometer had been proved, the results would be  still better with the points of light shown by minor planets rather  than with the disc of Mars.    In 1888-9, at the Cape, he observed the minor planets Iris, Victoria,  and Sappho, and secured the co-operation of four other heliometers.  His final result was 92,870,000 miles, the parallax being 8\",802  (_Cape Obs_., Vol. VI.).    So delicate were these measures that Gill detected a minute periodic  error of theory of twenty-seven days, owing to a periodically  erroneous position of the centre of gravity of the earth and moon to  which the position of the observer was referred. This led him to  correct the mass of the moon, and to fix its ratio to the earth's mass  = 0.012240.    Another method of getting the distance from the sun is to measure the  velocity of the earth's orbital motion, giving the circumference  traversed in a year, and so the radius of the orbit. This has been  done by comparing observation and experiment. The aberration of light  is an angle 20\" 48, giving the ratio of the earth's velocity to the  velocity of light. The velocity of light is 186,000 miles a second;  whence the distance to the sun is 92,780,000 miles. There seems,  however, to be some uncertainty about the true value of the  aberration, any determination of which is subject to irregularities  due to the \"seasonal errors.\" The velocity of light was experimentally  found, in 1862, by Fizeau and Foucault, each using an independent  method. These methods have been developed, and new values found, by  Cornu, Michaelson, Newcomb, and the present writer.    Quite lately Halm, at the Cape of Good Hope, measured  spectroscopically the velocity of the earth to and from a star by  observations taken six months apart.  Thence he obtained an accurate  value of the sun's distance.[5]    But the remarkably erratic minor planet, Eros, discovered by Witte in  1898, approaches the earth within 15,000,000 miles at rare intervals,  and, with the aid of photography, will certainly give us the best  result. A large number of observatories combined to observe the  opposition of 1900. Their results are not yet completely reduced, but  the best value deduced so far for the parallax[6] is 8\".807 +-  0\".0028.[7]      FOOTNOTES:    [1] In 1480 Martin Behaim, of Nuremberg, produced his _astrolabe_ for  measuring the latitude, by observation of the sun, at sea. It  consisted of a graduated metal circle, suspended by a ring which was  passed over the thumb, and hung vertically. A pointer was fixed to a  pin at the centre. This arm, called the _alhidada_, worked round the  graduated circle, and was pointed to the sun.  The altitude of the sun  was thus determined, and, by help of solar tables, the latitude could  be found from observations made at apparent noon.    [2] See illustration on p. 76.    [3] See Dreyer's article on these instruments in _Copernicus_,  Vol. I. They were stolen by the Germans after the relief of the  Embassies, in 1900. The best description of these instruments is  probably that contained in an interesting volume, which may be seen in  the library of the R. A. S., entitled _Chinese Researches_, by  Alexander Wyllie (Shanghai, 1897).    [4] Sir George Airy was very jealous of this honourable title. He  rightly held that there is only one Astronomer Royal at a time, as  there is only one Mikado, one Dalai Lama. He said that His Majesty's  Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, His Majesty's Astronomer for  Scotland, and His Majesty's Astronomer for Ireland are not called  Astronomers Royal.

HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE      Accounts of wonderful optical experiments by Roger Bacon (who died in  1292), and in the sixteenth century by Digges, Baptista Porta, and  Antonio de Dominis (Grant, _Hist. Ph. Ast_.), have led some to  suppose that they invented the telescope. The writer considers that it  is more likely that these notes refer to a kind of _camera  obscura_, in which a lens throws an inverted image of a landscape  on the wall.    The first telescopes were made in Holland, the originator being either  Henry Lipperhey,[1] Zacharias Jansen, or James Metius, and the date  1608 or earlier.    In 1609 Galileo, being in Venice, heard of the invention, went home  and worked out the theory, and made a similar telescope. These  telescopes were all made with a convex object-glass and a concave  eye-lens, and this type is spoken of as the Galilean telescope. Its  defects are that it has no real focus where cross-wires can be placed,  and that the field of view is very small.  Kepler suggested the convex  eye-lens in 1611, and Scheiner claimed to have used one in 1617. But  it was Huyghens who really introduced them. In the seventeenth century  telescopes were made of great length, going up to 300 feet. Huyghens  also invented the compound eye-piece that bears his name, made of two  convex lenses to diminish spherical aberration.    But the defects"]]]
