Rage flamed in his keen eyes;  but by the masterfulness of his self-control he kept his tones  level as he spoke.    \"Knew you this thing, Kulan Tith?\" he asked.  \"Knew you that my  daughter lay a prisoner in your palace?\"    \"He could not know it,\" interrupted Matai Shang, white with what  I am sure was more fear than rage.  \"He could not know it, for it  is a lie.\"    I would have had his life for that upon the spot, but even as I  sprang toward him Thuvan Dihn laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder.    \"Wait,\" he said to me, and then to Kulan Tith.  \"It is not a lie.  This much have I learned of the Prince of Helium--he does not lie.  Answer me, Kulan Tith--I have asked you a question.\"    \"Three women came with the Father of Therns,\" replied Kulan Tith.  \"Phaidor, his daughter, and two who were reported to be her slaves.  If these be Thuvia of Ptarth and Dejah Thoris of Helium I did not  know it--I have seen neither.  But if they be, then shall they be  returned to you on the morrow.\"    As he spoke he looked straight at Matai Shang, not as a devotee  should look at a high priest, but as a ruler of men looks at one  to whom he issues a command.    It must have been plain to the Father of Therns, as it was to me,  that the recent disclosures of his true character had done much  already to weaken the faith of Kulan Tith, and that it would require  but little more to turn the powerful jeddak into an avowed enemy;  but so strong are the seeds of superstition that even the great  Kaolian still hesitated to cut the final strand that bound him to  his ancient religion.    Matai Shang was wise enough to seem to accept the mandate of his  follower, and promised to bring the two slave women to the audience  chamber on the morrow.    \"It is almost morning now,\" he said, \"and I should dislike to break  in upon the slumber of my daughter, or I would have them fetched  at once that you might see that the Prince of Helium is mistaken,\"  and he emphasized the last word in an effort to affront me so  subtlely that I could not take open offense.    I was about to object to any delay, and demand that the Princess  of Helium be brought to me forthwith, when Thuvan Dihn made such  insistence seem unnecessary.    \"I should like to see my daughter at once,\" he said, \"but if Kulan  Tith will give me his assurance that none will be permitted to  leave the palace this night, and that no harm shall befall either  Dejah Thoris or Thuvia of Ptarth between now and the moment they  are brought into our presence in this chamber at daylight I shall  not insist.\"    \"None shall leave the palace tonight,\" replied the Jeddak of Kaol,  \"and Matai Shang will give us assurance that no harm will come to  the two women?\"    The thern assented with a nod.  A few moments later Kulan Tith  indicated that the audience was at an end, and at Thuvan Dihn's  invitation I accompanied the Jeddak of Ptarth to his own apartments,  where we sat until daylight, while he listened to the account of  my experiences upon his planet and to all that had befallen his  daughter during the time that we had been together.    I found the father of Thuvia a man after my own heart, and that  night saw the beginning of a friendship which has grown until it  is second only to that which obtains between Tars Tarkas, the green  Jeddak of Thark, and myself.    The first burst of Mars's sudden dawn brought messengers from Kulan  Tith, summoning us to the audience chamber where Thuvan Dihn was  to receive his daughter after years of separation, and I was to  be reunited with the glorious daughter of Helium after an almost  unbroken separation of twelve years.    My heart pounded within my bosom until I looked about me in  embarrassment, so sure was I that all within the room must hear.  My arms ached to enfold once more the divine form of her whose  eternal youth and undying beauty were but outward manifestations  of a perfect soul.    At last the messenger despatched to fetch Matai Shang returned.  I  craned my neck to catch the first glimpse of those who should be  following, but the messenger was alone.    Halting before the throne he addressed his jeddak in a voice that  was plainly audible to all within the chamber.    \"O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks,\" he cried, after the fashion  of the court, \"your messenger returns alone, for when he reached  the apartments of the Father of Therns he found them empty, as were  those occupied by his suite.\"    Kulan Tith went white.    A low groan burst from the lips of Thuvan Dihn who stood next me,  not having ascended the throne which awaited him beside his host.  For a moment the silence of death reigned in the great audience  chamber of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol.  It was he who broke the  spell.    Rising from his throne he stepped down from the dais to the side  of Thuvan Dihn.  Tears dimmed his eyes as he placed both his hands  upon the shoulders of his friend.    \"O Thuvan Dihn,\" he cried, \"that this should have happened in the  palace of thy best friend!  With my own hands would I have wrung  the neck of Matai Shang had I guessed what was in his foul heart.  Last night my life-long faith was weakened--this morning it has  been shattered; but too late, too late.    \"To wrest your daughter and the wife of this royal warrior from the  clutches of these archfiends you have but to command the resources  of a mighty nation, for all Kaol is at your disposal.  What may be  done?  Say the word!\"    \"First,\" I suggested, \"let us find those of your people who  be responsible for the escape of Matai Shang and his followers.  Without assistance on the part of the palace guard this thing could  not have come to pass.  Seek the guilty, and from them force an  explanation of the manner of their going and the direction they  have taken.\"    Before Kulan Tith could issue the commands that would initiate the  investigation a handsome young officer stepped forward and addressed  his jeddak.    \"O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks,\" he said, \"I alone be responsible  for this grievous error.  Last night it was I who commanded the  palace guard.  I was on duty in other parts of the palace during the  audience of the early morning, and knew nothing of what transpired  then, so that when the Father of Therns summoned me and explained  that it was your wish that his party be hastened from the city  because of the presence here of a deadly enemy who sought the Holy  Hekkador's life I did only what a lifetime of training has taught  me was the proper thing to do--I obeyed him whom I believed to be  the ruler of us all, mightier even than thou, mightiest of jeddaks.    \"Let the consequences and the punishment fall on me alone, for I  alone am guilty.  Those others of the palace guard who assisted in  the flight did so under my instructions.\"    Kulan Tith looked first at me and then at Thuvan Dihn, as though  to ask our judgment upon the man, but the error was so evidently  excusable that neither of us had any mind to see the young officer  suffer for a mistake that any might readily have made.    \"How left they,\" asked Thuvan Dihn, \"and what direction did they  take?\"    \"They left as they came,\" replied the officer, \"upon their own  flier.  For some time after they had departed I watched the vessel's  lights, which vanished finally due north.\"    \"Where north could Matai Shang find an asylum?\" asked Thuvan Dihn  of Kulan Tith.    For some moments the Jeddak of Kaol stood with bowed head, apparently  deep in thought.  Then a sudden light brightened his countenance.    \"I have it!\" he cried.  \"Only yesterday Matai Shang let drop a hint  of his destination, telling me of a race of people unlike ourselves  who dwell far to the north.  They, he said, had always been known  to the Holy Therns and were devout and faithful followers of the  ancient cult.  Among them would he find a perpetual haven of refuge,  where no 'lying heretics' might seek him out.  It is there that  Matai Shang has gone.\"    \"And in all Kaol there be no flier wherein to follow,\" I cried.    \"Nor nearer than Ptarth,\" replied Thuvan Dihn.    \"Wait!\" I exclaimed, \"beyond the southern fringe of this great  forest lies the wreck of the thern flier which brought me that far  upon my way.  If you will loan me men to fetch it, and artificers  to assist me, I can repair it in two days, Kulan Tith.\"    I had been more than half suspicious of the seeming sincerity of  the Kaolian jeddak's sudden apostasy, but the alacrity with which  he embraced my suggestion, and the despatch with which a force of  officers and men were placed at my disposal entirely removed the  last vestige of my doubts.    Two days later the flier rested upon the top of the watchtower,  ready to depart.  Thuvan Dihn and Kulan Tith had offered me the  entire resources of two nations--millions of fighting men were at  my disposal; but my flier could hold but one other than myself and  Woola.    As I stepped aboard her, Thuvan Dihn took his place beside me.  I  cast a look of questioning surprise upon him.  He turned to the  highest of his own officers who had accompanied him to Kaol.    \"To you I entrust the return of my retinue to Ptarth,\" he said.  \"There my son rules ably in my absence.  The Prince of Helium shall  not go alone into the land of his enemies.  I have spoken.  Farewell!\"          THROUGH THE CARRION CAVES      Straight toward the north, day and night, our destination compass  led us after the fleeing flier upon which it had remained set since  I first attuned it after leaving the thern fortress.    Early in the second night we noticed the air becoming perceptibly  colder, and from the distance we had come from the equator were  assured "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#15)"],[1,"to support her; at least, it will rent for something.  Her dower in the other two forties she can let you have, and no thanks  to me. Now do not misunderstand this letter. I do not write it in any  unkindness. I write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the  truth, which truth is, you are destitute because you have idled away  all your time. Your thousand pretenses deceive nobody but yourself. Go  to work is the only cure for your case.    A volume of disquisition could not put more clearly before the reader  the difference between Abraham Lincoln and the common run of Southern  and Western rural laborers. He had the same disadvantages that they  had. He grew up in the midst of poverty and ignorance; he was poisoned  with the enervating malaria of the Western woods, as all his fellows  were, and the consequences of it were seen in his character and  conduct to the close of his life. But he had, what very few of them  possessed any glimmering notion of, a fixed and inflexible will to  succeed. He did not love work, probably, any better than John  Johnston; but he had an innate self-respect, and a consciousness that  his self was worthy of respect, that kept him from idleness as it kept  him from all other vices, and made him a better man every year that he  lived.    We have anticipated a score of years in speaking of Mr. Lincoln's  relations to his family. It was in August of the year 1831 that he  finally left his father's roof, and swung out for himself into the  current of the world to make his fortune in his own way. He went down  to New Salem again to assist Offutt in the business that lively  speculator thought of establishing there. He was more punctual than  either his employer or the merchandise, and met with the usual reward  of punctuality in being forced to waste his time in waiting for the  tardy ones. He seemed to the New Salem people to be \"loafing\"; several  of them have given that description of him. He did one day's work  acting as clerk of a local election, a lettered loafer being pretty  sure of employment on such an occasion. [Footnote: Mrs. Lizzie H. Bell  writes of this incident: \"My father, Menton Graham, was on that day,  as usual, appointed to be a clerk, and Mr. McNamee, who was to be the  other, was sick and failed to come. They were looking around for a man  to fill his place when my father noticed Mr. Lincoln and asked if he  could write. He answered that 'he could make a few rabbit tracks.'\"]  He also piloted a boat down the Sangamon for one Dr. Nelson, who had  had enough of New Salem and wanted to go to Texas. This was probably a  task not requiring much pilot-craft, as the river was much swollen,  and navigators had in most places two or three miles of channel to  count upon. But Offutt and his goods arrived at last, and Lincoln and  he got them immediately into position, and opened their doors to what  commerce could be found in New Salem. There was clearly not enough to  satisfy the volatile mind of Mr. Offutt, for he soon bought Cameron's  mill at the historic dam, and made Abraham superintendent also of that  branch of the business.    It is to be surmised that Offutt never inspired his neighbors and  customers with any deep regard for his solidity of character. One of  them says of him with injurious pleonasm, that he \"talked too much  with his mouth.\" A natural consequence of his excessive fluency was  soon to be made disagreeably evident to his clerk. He admired Abraham  beyond measure, and praised him beyond prudence. He said that Abe knew  more than any man in the United States; and he was certainly not  warranted in making such an assertion, as his own knowledge of the  actual state of science in America could not have been exhaustive. He  also said that Abe could beat any man in the county running, jumping,  or \"wrastling.\" This proposition, being less abstract in its nature,  was more readily grasped by the local mind, and was not likely to pass  unchallenged.    [Illustration:   MAP OF NEW SALEM AND VICINITY]    Public opinion at New Salem was formed by a crowd of ruffianly young  fellows who were called the \"Clary's Grove Boys.\" Once or twice a week  they descended upon the village and passed the day in drinking,  fighting, and brutal horse-play. If a stranger appeared in the place,  he was likely to suffer a rude initiation into the social life of New  Salem at the hands of these jovial savages. Sometimes he was nailed up  in a hogshead and rolled down hill; sometimes he was insulted into a  fight and then mauled black and blue; for despite their pretensions to  chivalry they had no scruples about fair play or any such  superstitions of civilization. At first they did not seem inclined to  molest young Lincoln. His appearance did not invite insolence; his  reputation for strength and activity was a greater protection to him  than his inoffensive good-nature. But the loud admiration of Offutt  gave them umbrage. It led to dispute, contradictions, and finally to a  formal banter to a wrestling-match. Lincoln was greatly averse to all  this \"wooling and pulling,\" as he called it. But Offutt's indiscretion  had made it necessary for him to show his mettle. Jack Armstrong, the  leading bully of the gang, was selected to throw him, and expected an  easy victory. But he soon found himself in different hands from any he  had heretofore engaged with. Seeing he could not manage the tall  stranger, his friends swarmed in, and by kicking and tripping nearly  succeeded in getting Lincoln down. At this, as has been said of  another hero, \"the spirit of Odin entered into him,\" and putting forth  his whole strength, he held the pride of Clary's Grove in his arms  like a child, and almost choked the exuberant life out of him. For a  moment a general fight seemed inevitable; but Lincoln, standing  undismayed with his back to the wall, looked so formidable in his  defiance that an, honest admiration took the place of momentary fury,  and his initiation was over. As to Armstrong, he was Lincoln's friend  and sworn brother as soon as he recovered the use of his larynx, and  the bond thus strangely created lasted through life. Lincoln had no  further occasion to fight his own battles while Armstrong was there to  act as his champion. The two friends, although so widely different,  were helpful to each other afterwards in many ways, and Lincoln made  ample amends for the liberty his hands had taken with Jack's throat,  by saving, in a memorable trial, his son's neck from the halter.    This incident, trivial and vulgar as it may seem, was of great  importance in Lincoln's life. His behavior in this ignoble scuffle did  the work of years for him, in giving him the position he required in  the community where his lot was cast. He became from that moment, in a  certain sense, a personage, with a name and standing of his own. The  verdict of Clary's Grove was unanimous that he was \"the cleverest  fellow that had ever broke into the settlement.\" He did not have to be  constantly scuffling to guard his self-respect, and at the same time  he gained the good-will of the better sort by his evident  peaceableness and integrity.    [Illustration:   LEAF FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S EXERCISE BOOK. The page  here shown in reduced fac-simile is from the Exercise Book presented  by William H. Herndon to the Keyes-Lincoln Memorial Collection. When  the book was written Lincoln was about seventeen.]    He made on the whole a satisfactory clerk for Mr. Offutt, though his  downright honesty must have seemed occasionally as eccentric in that  position as afterwards it did to his associates at the bar. Dr.  Holland has preserved one or two incidents of this kind, which have  their value. Once, after he had sold a woman a little bill of goods  and received the money, he found on looking over the account again  that she had given him six and a quarter cents too much. The money  burned in his hands until he locked the shop and started on a walk of  several miles in the night to make restitution before he slept. On  another occasion, after weighing and delivering a pound of tea, he  found a small weight on the scales. He immediately weighed out the  quantity of tea of which he had innocently defrauded his customer and  went in search of her, his sensitive conscience not permitting any  delay. To show that the young merchant was not too good for this  world, the same writer gives an incident of his shop-keeping  experience of a different character. A rural bully having made himself  especially offensive one day, when women were present, by loud  profanity, Lincoln requested him to be silent. This was of course a  cause of war, and the young clerk was forced to follow the incensed  ruffian into the street, where the combat was of short duration.  Lincoln threw him at once to the ground, and gathering a handful of  the dog fennel with which the roadside was plentifully bordered, he  rubbed the ruffian's face and eyes with it until he howled for mercy.  He did not howl in vain, for the placable giant, when his discipline  was finished, brought water to bathe the culprit's smarting face, and  doubtless improved the occasion with quaint admonition.    A few passages at arms of this sort gave Abraham a redoubtable  reputation in the neighborhood. But the principal use he made of his  strength and his prestige was in the capacity of peacemaker, an office  which soon devolved upon him by general consent. Whenever old feuds  blossomed into fights by Offutt's door, or the chivalry of Clary's  Grove attempted in its energetic way to take the conceit out of some  stranger, or a canine duel spread contagion of battle among the  masters of the beasts, Lincoln usually appeared upon the scene, and  with a judicious mixture of force and reason and invincible good-  nature restored peace.    While working with Offutt his mind was turned in the direction of  English grammar. From what he had heard of it he thought it a"]]]
