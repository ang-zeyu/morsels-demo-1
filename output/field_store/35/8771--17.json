She took after her Grandmother West--a splendid  old lady.  She was the brightest, friendliest, merriest thing when she  was a child, Anne.  Everybody liked her.  She was her father's favorite  and she was awful fond of him.  They were 'chums,' as she used to say.  She couldn't see any of his faults--and he WAS a taking sort of man in  some ways.    \"Well, when Leslie was twelve years old, the first dreadful thing  happened.  She worshipped little Kenneth--he was four years younger  than her, and he WAS a dear little chap.  And he was killed one  day--fell off a big load of hay just as it was going into the barn, and  the wheel went right over his little body and crushed the life out of  it.  And mind you, Anne, Leslie saw it.  She was looking down from the  loft.  She gave one screech--the hired man said he never heard such a  sound in all his life--he said it would ring in his ears till Gabriel's  trump drove it out.  But she never screeched or cried again about it.  She jumped from the loft onto the load and from the load to the floor,  and caught up the little bleeding, warm, dead body, Anne--they had to  tear it from her before she would let it go.  They sent for me--I can't  talk of it.\"    Miss Cornelia wiped the tears from her kindly brown eyes and sewed in  bitter silence for a few minutes.    \"Well,\" she resumed, \"it was all over--they buried little Kenneth in  that graveyard over the harbor, and after a while Leslie went back to  her school and her studies.  She never mentioned Kenneth's name--I've  never heard it cross her lips from that day to this.  I reckon that old  hurt still aches and burns at times; but she was only a child and time  is real kind to children, Anne, dearie.  After a while she began to  laugh again--she had the prettiest laugh.  You don't often hear it now.\"    \"I heard it once the other night,\" said Anne.  \"It IS a beautiful  laugh.\"    \"Frank West began to go down after Kenneth's death.  He wasn't strong  and it was a shock to him, because he was real fond of the child,  though, as I've said, Leslie was his favorite.  He got mopy and  melancholy, and couldn't or wouldn't work.  And one day, when Leslie  was fourteen years of age, he hanged himself--and in the parlor, too,  mind you, Anne, right in the middle of the parlor from the lamp hook in  the ceiling.  Wasn't that like a man?  It was the anniversary of his  wedding day, too.  Nice, tasty time to pick for it, wasn't it?  And, of  course, that poor Leslie had to be the one to find him.  She went into  the parlor that morning, singing, with some fresh flowers for the  vases, and there she saw her father hanging from the ceiling, his face  as black as a coal.  It was something awful, believe ME!\"    \"Oh, how horrible!\" said Anne, shuddering.  \"The poor, poor child!\"    \"Leslie didn't cry at her father's funeral any more then she had cried  at Kenneth's.  Rose whooped and howled for two, however, and Leslie had  all she could do trying to calm and comfort her mother.  I was  disgusted with Rose and so was everyone else, but Leslie never got out  of patience.  She loved her mother.  Leslie is clannish--her own could  never do wrong in her eyes.  Well, they buried Frank West beside  Kenneth, and Rose put up a great big monument to him.  It was bigger  than his character, believe ME!  Anyhow, it was bigger than Rose could  afford, for the farm was mortgaged for more than its value.  But not  long after Leslie's old grandmother West died and she left Leslie a  little money--enough to give her a year at Queen's Academy.  Leslie had  made up her mind to pass for a teacher if she could, and then earn  enough to put herself through Redmond College.  That had been her  father's pet scheme--he wanted her to have what he had lost.  Leslie  was full of ambition and her head was chock full of brains.  She went  to Queen's, and she took two years' work in one year and got her First;  and when she came home she got the Glen school.  She was so happy and  hopeful and full of life and eagerness.  When I think of what she was  then and what she is now, I say--drat the men!\"    Miss Cornelia snipped her thread off as viciously as if, Nero-like, she  was severing the neck of mankind by the stroke.    \"Dick Moore came into her life that summer.  His father, Abner Moore,  kept store at the Glen, but Dick had a sea-going streak in him from his  mother; he used to sail in summer and clerk in his father's store in  winter.  He was a big, handsome fellow, with a little ugly soul.  He  was always wanting something till he got it, and then he stopped  wanting it--just like a man.  Oh, he didn't growl at the weather when  it was fine, and he was mostly real pleasant and agreeable when  everything went right.  But he drank a good deal, and there were some  nasty stories told of him and a girl down at the fishing village.  He  wasn't fit for Leslie to wipe her feet on, that's the long and short of  it.  And he was a Methodist!  But he was clean mad about her--because  of her good looks in the first place, and because she wouldn't have  anything to say to him in the second.  He vowed he'd have her--and he  got her!\"    \"How did he bring it about?\"    \"Oh, it was an iniquitous thing!  I'll never forgive Rose West.  You  see, dearie, Abner Moore held the mortgage on the West farm, and the  interest was overdue some years, and Dick just went and told Mrs. West  that if Leslie wouldn't marry him he'd get his father to foreclose the  mortgage.  Rose carried on terrible--fainted and wept, and pleaded with  Leslie not to let her be turned out of her home.  She said it would  break her heart to leave the home she'd come to as a bride.  I wouldn't  have blamed her for feeling dreadful bad over it--but you wouldn't have  thought she'd be so selfish as to sacrifice her own flesh and blood  because of it, would you?  Well, she was.    \"And Leslie gave in--she loved her mother so much she would have done  anything to save her pain.  She married Dick Moore.  None of us knew  why at the time.  It wasn't till long afterward that I found out how  her mother had worried her into it.  I was sure there was something  wrong, though, because I knew how she had snubbed him time and again,  and it wasn't like Leslie to turn face--about like that.  Besides, I  knew that Dick Moore wasn't the kind of man Leslie could ever fancy, in  spite of his good looks and dashing ways.  Of course, there was no  wedding, but Rose asked me to go and see them married.  I went, but I  was sorry I did.  I'd seen Leslie's face at her brother's funeral and  at her father's funeral--and now it seemed to me I was seeing it at her  own funeral.  But Rose was smiling as a basket of chips, believe ME!    \"Leslie and Dick settled down on the West place--Rose couldn't bear to  part with her dear daughter!--and lived there for the winter.  In the  spring Rose took pneumonia and died--a year too late!  Leslie was  heart-broken enough over it.  Isn't it terrible the way some unworthy  folks are loved, while others that deserve it far more, you'd think,  never get much affection?  As for Dick, he'd had enough of quiet  married life--just like a man.  He was for up and off.  He went over to  Nova Scotia to visit his relations--his father had come from Nova  Scotia--and he wrote back to Leslie that his cousin, George Moore, was  going on a voyage to Havana and he was going too.  The name of the  vessel was the Four Sisters and they were to be gone about nine weeks.    \"It must have been a relief to Leslie.  But she never said anything.  From the day of her marriage she was just what she is now--cold and  proud, and keeping everyone but me at a distance.  I won't BE kept at a  distance, believe ME!  I've just stuck to Leslie as close as I knew how  in spite of everything.\"    \"She told me you were the best friend she had,\" said Anne.    \"Did she?\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly.  \"Well, I'm real  thankful to hear it.  Sometimes I've wondered if she really did want me  around at all--she never let me think so.  You must have thawed her out  more than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you.  Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl!  I never see Dick Moore but I want to  run a knife clean through him.\"    Miss Cornelia wiped her eyes again and having relieved her feelings by  her blood-thirsty wish, took up her tale.    \"Well, Leslie was left over there alone.  Dick had put in the crop  before he went, and old Abner looked after it.  The summer went by and  the Four Sisters didn't come back.  The Nova Scotia Moores  investigated, and found she had got to Havana and discharged her cargo  and took on another and left for home; and that was all they ever found  out about her.  By degrees people began to talk of Dick Moore as one  that was dead.  Almost everyone believed that he was, though no one  felt certain, for men have turned up here at the harbor after they'd  been gone for years.  Leslie never thought he was dead--and she was  right.  A thousand pities too!  The next summer Captain Jim was in  Havana--that was before he gave up the sea, of course.  He thought he'd  poke round a bit--Captain Jim was always meddlesome, just like a  man--and he went to inquiring round among the sailors' boarding houses  and places like that, to see if he could find out anything about the  crew of the Four Sisters.  He'd better have let sleeping dogs lie, in  my opinion!  Well, he went to one out-of-the-way place, and there he  found a man he knew at first sight it was Dick Moore, though he had a  big beard.  Captain Jim got it shaved off and then there was no  doubt--Dick Moore it was--his body at least.  His mind wasn't there--as  for his soul, in my opinion he never had one!\"    \"What had happened to him?\"    \"Nobody knows the rights of it.  All the folks who kept the boarding  house could tell was that about a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#15)"],[1,"women are fond of chewing them, on     account of their pleasant taste. The ancient Egyptians used various     pills. Receipts for such things are found in the Ebers Papyrus.]    which you have so long lead to do without.\"    The paraschites seemed to drink these words from the mouth of his  grandchild. Again he lifted his hand in prayer, again Pentaur observed  that his glance met that of his wife, and a large, warm tear fell from  his old eyes on to his callous hand. Then he sank down, for he thought  the sick child was deluded by a dream. But there were the knots in her  dress.    With a trembling hand he untied them, and a gold ring rolled out on the  floor.    Bent-Anat picked it up, and gave it to the paraschites. \"I came here in  a lucky hour,\" she said, \"for you have recovered your son and your child  will live.\"    \"She will live,\" repeated the surgeon, who had remained a silent witness  of all that had occurred.    \"She will stay with us,\" murmured the old man, and then said, as he  approached the princess on his knees, and looked up at her beseechingly  with tearful eyes:    \"Pardon me as I pardon thee; and if a pious wish may not turn to a curse  from the lips of the unclean, let me bless thee.\"    \"I thank you,\" said Bent-Anat, towards whom the old man raised his hand  in blessing.    Then she turned to Nebsecht, and ordered him to take anxious care of  the sick girl; she bent over her, kissed her forehead, laid her gold  bracelet by her side, and signing to Pentaur left the hut with him.          CHAPTER VI.    During the occurrence we have described, the king's pioneer and the  young wife of Mena were obliged to wait for the princess.    The sun stood in the meridian, when Bent-Anat had gone into the hovel of  the paraschites.    The bare limestone rocks on each side of the valley and the sandy soil  between, shone with a vivid whiteness that hurt the eyes; not a hand's  breadth of shade was anywhere to be seen, and the fan-beaters of the  two, who were waiting there, had, by command of the princess, staid  behind with the chariot and litters.    For a time they stood silently near each other, then the fair Nefert  said, wearily closing her almond-shaped eyes:    \"How long Bent-Anat stays in the but of the unclean! I am perishing  here. What shall we do?\"    \"Stay!\" said Paaker, turning his back on the lady; and mounting a block  of stone by the side of the gorge, he cast a practised glance all round,  and returned to Nefert: \"I have found a shady spot,\" he said, \"out  there.\"    Mena's wife followed with her eyes the indication of his hand, and shook  her head. The gold ornaments on her head-dress rattled gently as she did  so, and a cold shiver passed over her slim body in spite of the midday  heat.    \"Sechet is raging in the sky,\" said Paaker.       [A goddess with the head of a lioness or a cat, over which the Sun-     disk is usually found. She was the daughter of Ra, and in the form     of the Uraeus on her father's crown personified the murderous heat     of the star of day. She incites man to the hot and wild passion of     love, and as a cat or lioness tears burning wounds in the limbs of     the guilty in the nether world; drunkenness and pleasure are her     gifts She was also named Bast and Astarte after her sister-divinity     among the Phoenicians.]    \"Let us avail ourselves of the shady spot, small though it be. At this  hour of the day many are struck with sickness.\"    \"I know it,\" said Nefert, covering her neck with her hand. Then she went  towards two blocks of stone which leaned against each other, and between  them afforded the spot of shade, not many feet wide, which Paaker had  pointed out as a shelter from the sun. Paaker preceded her, and rolled  a flat piece of limestone, inlaid by nature with nodules of flint,  under the stone pavilion, crushed a few scorpions which had taken refuge  there, spread his head-cloth over the hard seat, and said, \"Here you are  sheltered.\"    Nefert sank down on the stone and watched the Mohar, who slowly and  silently paced backwards and forward in front of her. This incessant to  and fro of her companion at last became unendurable to her sensitive and  irritated nerves, and suddenly raising her head from her hand, on which  she had rested it, she exclaimed    \"Pray stand still.\"    The pioneer obeyed instantly, and looked, as he stood with his back to  her, towards the hovel of the paraschites.    After a short time Nefert said, \"Say something to me!\"    The Mohar turned his full face towards her, and she was frightened at  the wild fire that glowed in the glance with which he gazed at her.    Nefert's eyes fell, and Paaker, saying:    \"I would rather remain silent,\" recommenced his walk, till Nefert called  to him again and said,    \"I know you are angry with me; but I was but a child when I was  betrothed to you. I liked you too, and when in our games your mother  called me your little wife, I was really glad, and used to think how  fine it would be when I might call all your possessions mine, the house  you would have so splendidly restored for me after your father's death,  the noble gardens, the fine horses in their stables, and all the male  and female slaves!\"    Paaker laughed, but the laugh sounded so forced and scornful that it cut  Nefert to the heart, and she went on, as if begging for indulgence:    \"It was said that you were angry with us; and now you will take my words  as if I had cared only for your wealth; but I said, I liked you. Do you  no longer remember how I cried with you over your tales of the bad  boys in the school; and over your father's severity? Then my uncle  died;--then you went to Asia.\"    \"And you,\" interrupted Paaker, hardly and drily, \"you broke your  bethrothal vows, and became the wife of the charioteer Mena. I know it  all; of what use is talking?\"    \"Because it grieves me that you should be angry, and your good mother  avoid our house. If only you could know what it is when love seizes one,  and one can no longer even think alone, but only near, and with, and in  the very arms of another; when one's beating heart throbs in one's very  temples, and even in one's dreams one sees nothing--but one only.\"    \"And do I not know it?\" cried Paaker, placing himself close before her  with his arms crossed. \"Do I not know it? and you it was who taught me  to know it. When I thought of you, not blood, but burning fire, coursed  in my veins, and now you have filled them with poison; and here in this  breast, in which your image dwelt, as lovely as that of Hathor in her  holy of holies, all is like that sea in Syria which is called the  Dead Sea, in which every thing that tries to live presently dies and  perishes.\"    Paaker's eyes rolled as he spoke, and his voice sounded hoarsely as he  went on.    \"But Mena was near to the king--nearer than I, and your mother--\"    \"My mother!\"--Nefert interrupted the angry Mohar. \"My mother did not  choose my husband. I saw him driving the chariot, and to me he resembled  the Sun God, and he observed me, and looked at me, and his glance  pierced deep into my heart like a spear; and when, at the festival of  the king's birthday, he spoke to me, it was just as if Hathor had thrown  round me a web of sweet, sounding sunbeams. And it was the same with  Mena; he himself has told me so since I have been his wife. For your  sake my mother rejected his suit, but I grew pale and dull with longing  for him, and he lost his bright spirit, and was so melancholy that the  king remarked it, and asked what weighed on his heart--for Rameses loves  him as his own son. Then Mena confessed to the Pharaoh that it was love  that dimmed his eye and weakened his strong hand; and then the king  himself courted me for his faithful servant, and my mother gave way,  and we were made man and wife, and all the joys of the justified in the  fields of Aalu       [The fields of the blest, which were opened to glorified souls. In     the Book of the Dead it is shown that in them men linger, and sow     and reap by cool waters.]    are shallow and feeble by the side of the bliss which we two have  known--not like mortal men, but like the celestial gods.\"    Up to this point Nefert had fixed her large eyes on the sky, like a  glorified soul; but now her gaze fell, and she said softly--    \"But the Cheta       [An Aramaean race, according to Schrader's excellent judgment. At     the time of our story the peoples of western Asia had allied     themselves to them.]    disturbed our happiness, for the king took Mena with him to the war.  Fifteen times did the moon, rise upon our happiness, and then--\"    \"And then the Gods heard my prayer, and accepted my offerings,\" said  Paaker, with a trembling voice, \"and tore the robber of my joys from  you, and scorched your heart and his with desire. Do you think you can  tell me anything I do not know? Once again for fifteen days was Mena  yours, and now he has not returned again from the war which is raging  hotly in Asia.\"    \"But he will return,\" cried the young wife.    \"Or possibly not,\" laughed Paaker. \"The Cheta, carry sharp weapons, and  there are many vultures in Lebanon, who perhaps at this hour are tearing  his flesh as he tore my heart.\"    Nefert rose at these words, her sensitive spirit bruised as with stones  thrown by a brutal hand, and attempted to leave her shady refuge to  follow the princess into the house of the parascllites; but her feet  refused to bear her, and she sank back trembling on her stone seat.  She tried to find words, but her tongue was powerless. Her powers  of resistance forsook her in her unutterable and soul-felt  distress--heart-wrung, forsaken and provoked.    A variety of painful sensations raised a hot vehement storm in  her bosom, which checked her breath, and at last found relief in a  passionate and convulsive weeping that shook her whole body. She saw  nothing more, she heard nothing more, she only shed tears and"]]]
