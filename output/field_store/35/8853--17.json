Will you  promise me one thing, Peggotty? Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and  little Em'ly, and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham, that I am not so bad as they  might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love--especially to little  Em'ly? Will you, if you please, Peggotty?'    The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the  greatest affection--I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had  been her honest face--and parted. From that night there grew up in my  breast a feeling for Peggotty which I cannot very well define. She did  not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a vacancy  in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her something  I have never felt for any other human being. It was a sort of comical  affection, too; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should  have done, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been  to me.    In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was going  to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed. She  also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come downstairs into  the parlour, and have my breakfast. There, I found my mother, very pale  and with red eyes: into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my  suffering soul.    'Oh, Davy!' she said. 'That you could hurt anyone I love! Try to be  better, pray to be better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,  that you should have such bad passions in your heart.'    They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more  sorry for that than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat  my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter,  and trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes, and then  glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and than look down, or look away.    'Master Copperfield's box there!' said Miss Murdstone, when wheels were  heard at the gate.    I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone  appeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door. The box  was taken out to his cart, and lifted in.    'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.    'Ready, my dear Jane,' returned my mother. 'Good-bye, Davy. You are  going for your own good. Good-bye, my child. You will come home in the  holidays, and be a better boy.'    'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated.    'Certainly, my dear Jane,' replied my mother, who was holding me. 'I  forgive you, my dear boy. God bless you!'    'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated.    Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to say on  the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad end; and  then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.        CHAPTER 5. I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME      We might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was  quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short. Looking out to  ascertain for what, I saw, to My amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge  and climb into the cart. She took me in both her arms, and squeezed me  to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful, though  I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender. Not  a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing one of her arms, she put  it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper bags of  cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a purse which she put into  my hand, but not one word did she say. After another and a final squeeze  with both arms, she got down from the cart and ran away; and, my belief  is, and has always been, without a solitary button on her gown. I  picked up one, of several that were rolling about, and treasured it as a  keepsake for a long time.    The carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she were coming back. I  shook my head, and said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier  to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly.    Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think  it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,  nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I  could remember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this  resolution, proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon  the horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly  small it looked, under those circumstances.    I had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather purse,  with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had  evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But its  most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit  of paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, 'For Davy. With my  love.' I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good  as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I  had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes  on my sleeve and stopped myself.    For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was  still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for  some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.    'All the way where?' inquired the carrier.    'There,' I said.    'Where's there?' inquired the carrier.    'Near London,' I said.    'Why that horse,' said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,  'would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.'    'Are you only going to Yarmouth then?' I asked.    'That's about it,' said the carrier. 'And there I shall take you to the  stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that'll take you to--wherever it is.'    As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis)  to say--he being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic  temperament, and not at all conversational--I offered him a cake as a  mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant,  and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have  done on an elephant's.    'Did SHE make 'em, now?' said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, in his  slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee.    'Peggotty, do you mean, sir?'    'Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. 'Her.'    'Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.'    'Do she though?' said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if to whistle,  but he didn't whistle. He sat looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw  something new there; and sat so, for a considerable time. By and by, he  said:    'No sweethearts, I b'lieve?'    'Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?' For I thought he wanted  something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of  refreshment.    'Hearts,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!'    'With Peggotty?'    'Ah!' he said. 'Her.'    'Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.'    'Didn't she, though!' said Mr. Barkis.    Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, but  sat looking at the horse's ears.    'So she makes,' said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,  'all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?'    I replied that such was the fact.    'Well. I'll tell you what,' said Mr. Barkis. 'P'raps you might be  writin' to her?'    'I shall certainly write to her,' I rejoined.    'Ah!' he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. 'Well! If you was  writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin';  would you?'    'That Barkis is willing,' I repeated, innocently. 'Is that all the  message?'    'Ye-es,' he said, considering. 'Ye-es. Barkis is willin'.'    'But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,' I said,  faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, and  could give your own message so much better.'    As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head,  and once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound  gravity, 'Barkis is willin'. That's the message,' I readily undertook  its transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel  at Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and  an inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty, which ran thus: 'My dear  Peggotty. I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama.  Yours affectionately. P.S. He says he particularly wants you to  know--BARKIS IS WILLING.'    When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis  relapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that  had happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I  slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new  and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once  abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's  family there, perhaps even with little Em'ly herself.    The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any  horses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was  more unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and  wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis had  put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up the yard  to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me, when a  lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were  hanging up, and said:    'Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?'    'Yes, ma'am,' I said.    'What name?' inquired the lady.    'Copperfield, ma'am,' I said.    'That won't do,' returned the lady. 'Nobody's dinner is paid for here,  in that name.'    'Is it Murdstone, ma'am?' I said.    'If you're Master Murdstone,' said the lady, 'why do you go and give  another name, first?'    I explained to the lady how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#15)"],[1,"ald's way--he has tried all the things the  others thought of. Why couldn't we rescue Lord Tottenham?'    Lord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the Heath every day  in a paper collar at three o'clock--and when he gets halfway, if there  is no one about, he changes his collar and throws the dirty one into the  furze-bushes.    Dicky said, 'Lord Tottenham's all right--but where's the deadly peril?'    And we couldn't think of any. There are no highwaymen on Blackheath now,  I am sorry to say. And though Oswald said half of us could be highwaymen  and the other half rescue party, Dora kept on saying it would be wrong  to be a highwayman--and so we had to give that up.    Then Alice said, 'What about Pincher?'    And we all saw at once that it could be done.    Pincher is very well bred, and he does know one or two things, though we  never could teach him to beg. But if you tell him to hold on--he will do  it, even if you only say 'Seize him!' in a whisper.    So we arranged it all. Dora said she wouldn't play; she said she thought  it was wrong, and she knew it was silly--so we left her out, and she  went and sat in the dining-room with a goody-book, so as to be able to  say she didn't have anything to do with it, if we got into a row over  it.    Alice and H. O. were to hide in the furze-bushes just by where Lord  Tottenham changes his collar, and they were to whisper, 'Seize him!' to  Pincher; and then when Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to  go and rescue him from his deadly peril. And he would say, 'How can I  reward you, my noble young preservers?' and it would be all right.    So we went up to the Heath. We were afraid of being late. Oswald told  the others what Procrastination was--so they got to the furze-bushes a  little after two o'clock, and it was rather cold. Alice and H. O. and  Pincher hid, but Pincher did not like it any more than they did, and as  we three walked up and down we heard him whining. And Alice kept saying,  'I _am_ so cold! Isn't he coming yet?' And H. O. wanted to come out  and jump about to warm himself. But we told him he must learn to be  a Spartan boy, and that he ought to be very thankful he hadn't got a  beastly fox eating his inside all the time. H. O. is our little brother,  and we are not going to let it be our fault if he grows up a milksop.  Besides, it was not really cold. It was his knees--he wears socks. So  they stayed where they were. And at last, when even the other three who  were walking about were beginning to feel rather chilly, we saw Lord  Tottenham's big black cloak coming along, flapping in the wind like a  great bird. So we said to Alice--    'Hist! he approaches. You'll know when to set Pincher on by hearing Lord  Tottenham talking to himself--he always does while he is taking off his  collar.'    Then we three walked slowly away whistling to show we were not thinking  of anything. Our lips were rather cold, but we managed to do it.    Lord Tottenham came striding along, talking to himself. People call him  the mad Protectionist. I don't know what it means--but I don't think  people ought to call a Lord such names.    As he passed us he said, 'Ruin of the country, sir! Fatal error, fatal  error!' And then we looked back and saw he was getting quite near where  Pincher was, and Alice and H. O. We walked on--so that he shouldn't  think we were looking--and in a minute we heard Pincher's bark, and then  nothing for a bit; and then we looked round, and sure enough good old  Pincher had got Lord Tottenham by the trouser leg and was holding on  like billy-ho, so we started to run.    Lord Tottenham had got his collar half off--it was sticking out sideways  under his ear--and he was shouting, 'Help, help, murder!' exactly as if  some one had explained to him beforehand what he was to do. Pincher was  growling and snarling and holding on. When we got to him I stopped and  said--    'Dicky, we must rescue this good old man.'    Lord Tottenham roared in his fury, 'Good old man be--' something or  othered. 'Call the dog off.'    So Oswald said, 'It is a dangerous task--but who would hesitate to do an  act of true bravery?'    And all the while Pincher was worrying and snarling, and Lord Tottenham  shouting to us to get the dog away. He was dancing about in the road  with Pincher hanging on like grim death; and his collar flapping about,  where it was undone.    Then Noel said, 'Haste, ere yet it be too late.' So I said to Lord  Tottenham--    'Stand still, aged sir, and I will endeavour to alleviate your  distress.'    He stood still, and I stooped down and caught hold of Pincher and  whispered, 'Drop it, sir; drop it!'    So then Pincher dropped it, and Lord Tottenham fastened his collar  again--he never does change it if there's any one looking--and he said--    'I'm much obliged, I'm sure. Nasty vicious brute! Here's something to  drink my health.'    But Dicky explained that we are teetotallers, and do not drink people's  healths. So Lord Tottenham said, 'Well, I'm much obliged any way. And  now I come to look at you--of course, you're not young ruffians, but  gentlemen's sons, eh? Still, you won't be above taking a tip from an old  boy--I wasn't when I was your age,' and he pulled out half a sovereign.    It was very silly; but now we'd done it I felt it would be beastly mean  to take the old boy's chink after putting him in such a funk. He didn't  say anything about bringing us up as his own sons--so I didn't know what  to do. I let Pincher go, and was just going to say he was very welcome,  and we'd rather not have the money, which seemed the best way out of it,  when that beastly dog spoiled the whole show. Directly I let him go he  began to jump about at us and bark for joy, and try to lick our faces.  He was so proud of what he'd done. Lord Tottenham opened his eyes and he  just said, 'The dog seems to know you.'    And then Oswald saw it was all up, and he said, 'Good morning,' and  tried to get away. But Lord Tottenham said--    'Not so fast!' And he caught Noel by the collar. Noel gave a howl, and  Alice ran out from the bushes. Noel is her favourite. I'm sure I don't  know why. Lord Tottenham looked at her, and he said--    'So there are more of you!' And then H. O. came out.    'Do you complete the party?' Lord Tottenham asked him. And H. O. said  there were only five of us this time.    Lord Tottenham turned sharp off and began to walk away, holding Noel by  the collar. We caught up with him, and asked him where he was going, and  he said, 'To the Police Station.' So then I said quite politely, 'Well,  don't take Noel; he's not strong, and he easily gets upset. Besides, it  wasn't his doing. If you want to take any one take me--it was my very  own idea.'    Dicky behaved very well. He said, 'If you take Oswald I'll go too, but  don't take Noel; he's such a delicate little chap.'    Lord Tottenham stopped, and he said, 'You should have thought of that  before.' Noel was howling all the time, and his face was very white, and  Alice said--    'Oh, do let Noel go, dear, good, kind Lord Tottenham; he'll faint if you  don't, I know he will, he does sometimes. Oh, I wish we'd never done it!  Dora said it was wrong.'    'Dora displayed considerable common sense,' said Lord Tottenham, and he  let Noel go. And Alice put her arm round Noel and tried to cheer him up,  but he was all trembly, and as white as paper.    Then Lord Tottenham said--    'Will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape?'    So we said we would.    'Then follow me,' he said, and led the way to a bench. We all followed,  and Pincher too, with his tail between his legs--he knew something was  wrong. Then Lord Tottenham sat down, and he made Oswald and Dicky and  H. O. stand in front of him, but he let Alice and Noel sit down. And he  said--    'You set your dog on me, and you tried to make me believe you were  saving me from it. And you would have taken my half-sovereign. Such  conduct is most--No--you shall tell me what it is, sir, and speak the  truth.'    So I had to say it was most ungentlemanly, but I said I hadn't been  going to take the half-sovereign.    'Then what did you do it for?' he asked. 'The truth, mind.'    So I said, 'I see now it was very silly, and Dora said it was wrong,  but it didn't seem so till we did it. We wanted to restore the fallen  fortunes of our house, and in the books if you rescue an old gentleman  from deadly peril, he brings you up as his own son--or if you prefer  to be your father's son, he starts you in business, so that you end in  wealthy affluence; and there wasn't any deadly peril, so we made Pincher  into one--and so--' I was so ashamed I couldn't go on, for it did seem  an awfully mean thing. Lord Tottenham said--    'A very nice way to make your fortune--by deceit and trickery. I have a  horror of dogs. If I'd been a weak man the shock might have killed me.  What do you think of yourselves, eh?'    We were all crying except Oswald, and the others say he was; and Lord  Tottenham went on--'Well, well, I see you're sorry. Let this be a lesson  to you; and we'll say no more about it. I'm an old man now, but I was  young once.'    Then Alice slid along the bench close to him, and put her hand on his  arm: her fingers were pink through the holes in her woolly gloves, and  said, 'I think you're very good to forgive us, and we are really very,  very sorry. But we wanted to be like the children in the books--only  we never have the chances they have. Everything they do turns out all  right. But we _are_ sorry, very, very. And I know Oswald wasn't going to  take the half-sovereign. Directly you said that about a tip from an old  boy I began to feel bad inside, and I whispered to H. O. that I wished  we hadn't.'    Then Lord Tottenham stood up, and he looked like the Death of Nelson,  for he is clean shaved and it is a good face, and he said--    'Always remember never to do a dishonourable thing, for money or for"]]]
