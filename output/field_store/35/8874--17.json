When the dinner was ready, the servant called  his master and his guests into the dining-room. While they were eating,  Juan said in a loud voice,--              \"Tawi cami          Sa quisami          Qui masiram          Na ulaman.\" [27]      The Buringcantada was very angry to hear the voice of a man in the  ceiling, and he said in a thundering voice, \"If you are a big man  like me, let me see one of your hairs!\"    Juan showed the rope from the hole in the ceiling.    Astonished at the size of the hair, the Buringcantada said again,  \"Let me see one of your teeth!\" Juan showed the axe.    By this time Juan's mother was almost dead with fear, and she told  her son not to move.    After a few minutes the Buringcantada said again, \"Beat your stomach,  and let me hear the sound of it!\" When Juan beat the drum, the  Buringcantada and all the guests and servants ran away in fright,  for they had never heard such a sound before.    Then Juan and his mother came down from the ceiling. In this house  they lived like a rich family, for they found much money in one of  the rooms. As for the Buringcantada, he never came back to his house  after he left it.      The Manglalabas.    Narrated by Arsenio Bonifacio, a Tagalog, who heard the story from  his father.    Once upon a time, in the small town of Balubad, there was a big  house. It was inhabited by a rich family. When the head of the family  died, the house was gloomy and dark. The family wore black clothes,  and was sad.    Three days after the death of the father, the family began to be  troubled at night by a manglalabas. [28] He threw stones at the house,  broke the water-jars, and moved the beds. Some pillows were even  found in the kitchen the next day. The second night, Manglalabas  visited the house again. He pinched the widow; but when she woke  up, she could not see anything. Manglalabas also emptied all the  water-jars. Accordingly the family decided to abandon the house.    A band of brave men in that town assembled, and went to the house. At  midnight the spirit came again, but the brave men said they were ready  to fight it. Manglalabas made a great deal of noise in the house. He  poured out all the water, kicked the doors, and asked the men who they  were. They answered, \"We are fellows who are going to kill you.\" But  when the spirit approached them, and they saw that it was a ghost,  they fled away. From that time on, nobody was willing to pass a night  in that house.    In a certain barrio [29] of Balubad there lived two queer men. One  was called Bulag, because he was blind; and the other, Cuba, because  he was hunchbacked. One day these two arranged to go to Balubad to  beg. Before they set out, they agreed that the blind man should carry  the hunchback on his shoulder to the town. So they set out. After they  had crossed the Balubad River, Cuba said, \"Stop a minute, Bulag! here  is a hatchet.\" Cuba got down and picked it up. Then they proceeded  again. A second time Cuba got off the blind man's shoulder, for he  saw an old gun by the roadside. He picked this up also, and took it  along with him.    When they reached the town, they begged at many of the houses, and  finally they came to the large abandoned house. They did not know  that this place was haunted by a spirit. Cuba said, \"Maybe no one is  living in this house;\" and Bulag replied, \"I think we had better stay  here for the night.\"    As they were afraid that somebody might come, they went up into the  ceiling. At midnight they were awakened by Manglalabas making a great  noise and shouting, \"I believe that there are some new persons in my  house!\" Cuba, frightened, fired the gun. The ghost thought that the  noise of the gun was some one crying. So he said, \"If you are truly  a big man, give me some proofs.\"    Then Cuba took the handle out of the hatchet and threw the head down  at the ghost. Manglalabas thought that this was one of the teeth of  his visitor, and, convinced that the intruder was a powerful person,  he said, \"I have a buried treasure near the barn. I wish you to  dig it up. The reason I come here every night is on account of this  treasure. If you will only dig it up, I will not come here any more.\"    The next night Bulag and Cuba dug in the ground near the barn. There  they found many gold and silver pieces. When they were dividing the  riches, Cuba kept three-fourths of the treasure for himself. Bulag  said, \"Let me see if you have divided fairly,\" and, placing his hands  on the two piles, he found that Cuba's was much larger.    Angry at the discovery, Cuba struck Bulag in the eyes, and they  were opened. When Bulag could see, he kicked Cuba in the back, and  straightway his deformity disappeared. Therefore they became friends  again, divided the money equally, and owned the big house between them.      Notes.    A Pampango version, \"The Cripple and the Blind Man\" (I have it only  in abstract), is almost identical with the second part of \"The Four  Blind Brothers.\" A blind man and a cripple travel together, blind  man carrying, cripple guiding. Rope, drum, hatchet, etc. But these  two companions do not quarrel over the distribution of the wealth:  they live peacefully together.    I have printed in full five of the versions, because, while they  are members of a very widespread family of tales in which a poor but  valiant hero deceives and outwits a giant, ogre, ghost, or band of  robbers, they form a more restricted brotherhood of that large family,  and the deception is of a very definite special sort. The hero and the  outwitted do not meet face to face, nor is there a contest of prowess  between them. Merely by displaying as tokens of his size and strength  certain seemingly useless articles which he has picked up and carried  along with him on his travels, the hero frightens forever from their  rich home a band of robbers or a giant or a ghost, and remains in  possession of the treasures of the deceived one.    Trolls, ogres, giants, robbers, dragons, are proverbially stupid,  and a clever hero with more wits than brawn has no difficulty in  thoroughly frightening them. Grimm's story of \"The Brave Little Tailor\"  (No. 20), with its incidents of \"cheese-squeezing,\" \"bird-throwing,\"  \"pretended carrying of the oak-tree,\" \"springing over the cherry-tree,\"  and \"escape from the bed,\" and opening with the \"seven-at-a-blow\"  episode, is typical of one large group of tales about a giant  outwitted. (For an enumeration of the analogues, see Bolte-Polivka,  1 : 148-165; for a fuller discussion of some of them, see Cosquin,  1 : 96-102.) In another group the hero takes service with the giant,  dragon, etc., keeps up the deception of being superhumanly strong,  but gets the monster to do all the work, and finally wins his way to  wealth and release (see Grimm, No. 183; Von Hahn, No. 18 and notes;  Crane, 345, note 34; Dasent, Nos. v and xxxii). Then there is the  group of stories in which the cannibal witch is popped into her own  oven, which she had been heating for her victim (cf. Grimm, No. 15;  and Bolte-Polivka, 1 : 123).    Our particular group of stories, however, seems to owe little or  nothing to the types just mentioned. It appears to belong peculiarly  to the Orient. In fact, I do not know of its occurrence outside of  India and the Philippines. That the tale is well known in the Islands  at least as far north as central Luzon, our five variants attest;  and that it is fairly widespread in India,--I refer particularly to  the method of the deception, for on this the whole story turns,--three  Hindoo versions may be cited as evidence.    (1) \"The Blind Man, the Deaf Man, and the Donkey\" (Frere, No. 18)  presents many close correspondences to \"Juan the Blind Man.\" In the  Indian tale a blind man and a deaf man enter into partnership. One day,  while on a long walk with his friend, the deaf man sees a donkey with  a large water-jar on its back. Thinking the animal will be useful  to them, they take it and the jar with them. Farther along they  collect some large black ants in a snuff-box. Overtaken by storm,  they seek shelter in a large, apparently deserted house, and lock  the door; but the owner, a terrible Rakshas, returns, and loudly  demands entrance. The deaf man, looking through a chink in the wall,  is greatly frightened by the appearance of the monster; but the blind  man boldly says that he is Bakshas, Rakshas's father. Incredulous,  the Rakshas wishes to see his father's face. Donkey's head shown. On  his desiring to see his father's body, the huge jar is rolled  with a thundering noise past the chink in the door. Rakshas asks  to hear Bakshas scream. Deaf man puts ants into the donkey's ear:  the animal, bit by the insects, brays horribly, and the Rakshas flees  in fright... (Rakshas returns the next morning, and seeing the blind  man, deaf man, and donkey, laden with treasures, leaving his house,  he determines to be avenged; but by a lucky series of accidents  the travellers succeed in discomfiting and thoroughly terrifying  the Rakshas and his six companions summoned to help him, and travel  on). In the division of the spoils, the deaf man attempts to cheat  the blind man, who in a rage gives him so tremendous a box on the  ear, that his hearing is restored! In return, the deaf man gives his  neighbor so hard a blow in the face, that the blind man's eyes are  opened. They are both so astonished, that they become good friends  at once, and divide the wealth equally.    (2) \"The Brahmin Girl that married a Tiger\" (Kingscote, No. x). In  this story, three brothers, on their way to rescue their sister who  had been married to a tiger, take along with them an ass, an ant,  a palmyra-tree, and a big iron washing-tub. The sister hides her  brothers and their possessions in a loft. The tiger comes home,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#15)"],[1,"their passage through the waves in fair weather. And soon they  passed the outfall of the river Callichorus, where, as the tale goes,  the Nysean son of Zeus, when he had left the tribes of the Indians and  came to dwell at Thebes, held revels and arrayed dances in front of a  cave, wherein he passed unsmiling sacred nights, from which time the  neighbours call the river by the name of Callichorus [1204] and the cave  Aulion.[1205]    (ll. 911-929) Next they beheld the barrow of Sthenelus, Actor's son, who  on his way back from the valorous war against the Amazons--for he had  been the comrade of Heracles--was struck by an arrow and died there  upon the sea-beach. And for a time they went no further, for Persephone  herself sent forth the spirit of Actor's son which craved with many  tears to behold men like himself, even for a moment. And mounting on the  edge of the barrow he gazed upon the ship, such as he was when he went  to war; and round his head a fair helm with four peaks gleamed with its  blood-red crest. And again he entered the vast gloom; and they looked  and marvelled; and Mopsus, son of Ampycus, with word of prophecy urged  them to land and propitiate him with libations. Quickly they drew in  sail and threw out hawsers, and on the strand paid honour to the tomb of  Sthenelus, and poured out drink offerings to him and sacrificed sheep as  victims. And besides the drink offerings they built an altar to Apollo,  saviour of ships, and burnt thigh bones; and Orpheus dedicated his lyre;  whence the place has the name of Lyra.    (ll. 930-945) And straightway they went aboard as the wind blew strong;  and they drew the sail down, and made it taut to both sheets; then Argo  was borne over the sea swiftly, even as a hawk soaring high through the  air commits to the breeze its outspread wings and is borne on swiftly,  nor swerves in its flight, poising in the clear sky with quiet pinions.  And lo, they passed by the stream of Parthenius as it flows into the  sea, a most gentle river, where the maid, daughter of Leto, when she  mounts to heaven after the chase, cools her limbs in its much-desired  waters. Then they sped onward in the night without ceasing, and passed  Sesamus and lofty Erythini, Crobialus, Cromna and woody Cytorus. Next  they swept round Carambis at the rising of the sun, and plied the oars  past long Aegialus, all day and on through the night.    (ll. 946-965) And straightway they landed on the Assyrian shore where  Zeus himself gave a home to Sinope, daughter of Asopus, and granted her  virginity, beguiled by his own promises. For he longed for her love, and  he promised to grant her whatever her hearts desire might be. And she in  her craftiness asked of him virginity. And in like manner she deceived  Apollo too who longed to wed her, and besides them the river Halys, and  no man ever subdued her in love's embrace. And there the sons of  noble Deimachus of Tricca were still dwelling, Deileon, Autolycus and  Phlogius, since the day when they wandered far away from Heracles; and  they, when they marked the array of chieftains, went to meet them and  declared in truth who they were; and they wished to remain there no  longer, but as soon as Argestes [1206] blew went on ship-board. And so  with them, borne along by the swift breeze, the heroes left behind the  river Halys, and left behind his that flows hard by, and the delta-land  of Assyria; and on the same day they rounded the distant headland of the  Amazons that guards their harbour.    (ll. 966-1001) Here once when Melanippe, daughter of Ares, had, gone  forth, the hero Heracles caught her by ambuscade and Hippolyte gave  him her glistening girdle as her sister's ransom, and he sent away  his captive unharmed. In the bay of this headland, at the outfall of  Thermodon, they ran ashore, for the sea was rough for their voyage. No  river is like this, and none sends forth from itself such mighty streams  over the land. If a man should count every one he would lack but four of  a hundred, but the real spring is only one. This flows down to the  plain from lofty mountains, which, men say, are called the Amazonian  mountains. Thence it spreads inland over a hilly country straight  forward; wherefrom its streams go winding on, and they roll on, this way  and that ever more, wherever best they can reach the lower ground, one  at a distance and another near at hand; and many streams are swallowed  up in the sand and are without a name; but, mingled with a few, the  main stream openly bursts with its arching crest of foam into the  inhospitable Pontus. And they would have tarried there and have closed  in battle with the Amazons, and would have fought not without bloodshed  for the Amazons were not gentle foes and regarded not justice, those  dwellers on the Doeantian plain; but grievous insolence and the works  of Ares were all their care; for by race they were the daughters of Ares  and the nymph Harmonia, who bare to Ares war-loving maids, wedded to him  in the glens of the Acmonian wood had not the breezes of Argestes come  again from Zeus; and with the wind they left the rounded beach, where  the Themiscyreian Amazons were arming for war. For they dwelt not  gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into  three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians, over whom at that  time Hippolyte reigned, in another the Lycastians, and in another the  dart-throwing Chadesians. And the next day they sped on and at nightfall  they reached the land of the Chalybes.    (ll. 1002-1008) That folk have no care for ploughing with oxen or for  any planting of honey-sweet fruit; nor yet do they pasture flocks in  the dewy meadow. But they cleave the hard iron-bearing land and exchange  their wages for daily sustenance; never does the morn rise for them  without toil, but amid bleak sooty flames and smoke they endure heavy  labour.    (ll. 1009-1014) And straightway thereafter they rounded the headland of  Genetaean Zeus and sped safely past the land of the Tibareni. Here when  wives bring forth children to their husbands, the men lie in bed and  groan with their heads close bound; but the women tend them with food,  and prepare child-birth baths for them.    (ll. 1015-1029) Next they reached the sacred mount and the land where  the Mossynoeci dwell amid high mountains in wooden huts, [1207] from  which that people take their name. And strange are their customs and  laws. Whatever it is right to do openly before the people or in the  market place, all this they do in their homes, but whatever acts we  perform at home, these they perform out of doors in the midst of  the streets, without blame. And among them is no reverence for the  marriage-bed, but, like swine that feed in herds, no whit abashed in  others' presence, on the earth they lie with the women. Their king sits  in the loftiest hut and dispenses upright judgments to the multitude,  poor wretch! For if haply he err at all in his decrees, for that day  they keep him shut up in starvation.    (ll. 1030-1046) They passed them by and cleft their way with oars over  against the island of Ares all day long; for at dusk the light breeze  left them. At last they spied above them, hurtling through the air, one  of the birds of Ares which haunt that isle. It shook its wings down over  the ship as she sped on and sent against her a keen feather, and it fell  on the left shoulder of goodly Oileus, and he dropped his oar from his  hands at the sudden blow, and his comrades marvelled at the sight of the  winged bolt. And Eribotes from his seat hard by drew out the feather,  and bound up the wound when he had loosed the strap hanging from his  own sword-sheath; and besides the first, another bird appeared swooping  down; but the hero Clytius, son of Eurytus--for he bent his curved bow,  and sped a swift arrow against the bird--struck it, and it whirled round  and fell close to the ship. And to them spake Amphidamas, son of Aleus:    (ll. 1047-1067) \"The island of Ares is near us; you know it yourselves  now that ye have seen these birds. But little will arrows avail us, I  trow, for landing. But let us contrive some other device to help us, if  ye intend to land, bearing in mind the injunction of Phineus. For not  even could Heracles, when he came to Arcadia, drive away with bow and  arrow the birds that swam on the Stymphalian lake. I saw it myself. But  he shook in his hand a rattle of bronze and made a loud clatter as  he stood upon a lofty peak, and the birds fled far off, screeching in  bewildered fear. Wherefore now too let us contrive some such device, and  I myself will speak, having pondered the matter beforehand. Set on your  heads your helmets of lofty crest, then half row by turns, and half  fence the ship about with polished spears and shields. Then all together  raise a mighty shout so that the birds may be scared by the unwonted  din, the nodding crests, and the uplifted spears on high. And if we  reach the island itself, then make mighty noise with the clashing of  shields.\"    (ll. 1068-1089) Thus he spake, and the helpful device pleased all. And  on their heads they placed helmets of bronze, gleaming terribly, and the  blood-red crests were tossing. And half of them rowed in turn, and the  rest covered the ship with spears and shields. And as when a man roofs  over a house with tiles, to be an ornament of his home and a defence  against rain, and one the fits firmly into another, each after each; so  they roofed over the ship with their shields, locking them together. And  as a din arises from a warrior-host of men sweeping on, when lines of  battle meet, such a shout rose upward from the ship into the air. Now  they saw none of the birds yet, but when they touched the island and  clashed upon their shields, then the birds in countless numbers rose in  flight hither and thither. And as when the son of Cronos sends from the  clouds a dense hailstorm on city and"]]]
