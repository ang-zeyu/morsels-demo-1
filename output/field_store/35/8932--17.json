Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,  A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,  And the clean white expires.  The other two  Look'd on exclaiming:  \"Ah, how dost thou change,  Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,  Nor only one.\"  The two heads now became  One, and two figures blended in one form  Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths  Two arms were made:  the belly and the chest  The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,  As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape  All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd  That image miscreate, and so pass'd on  With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge  Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,  Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems  A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,  So toward th' entrails of the other two  Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,  As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.  In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,  One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell  Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him  But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,  As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.  He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him.  One from the wound, the other from the mouth  Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd.       Lucan in mute attention now may hear,  Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus!  tell,  Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute.  What if in warbling fiction he record  Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake  Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,  I envy not; for never face to face  Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,  Wherein both shapes were ready to assume  The other's substance.  They in mutual guise  So answer'd, that the serpent split his train  Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit  Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs  Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon  Was visible:  the tail disparted took  The figure which the spirit lost, its skin  Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind.  The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd  The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet  So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk.  The feet behind then twisting up became  That part that man conceals, which in the wretch  Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke  With a new colour veils, and generates  Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off  From th' other body, lo!  upon his feet  One upright rose, and prone the other fell.  Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps  Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath.  Of him who stood erect, the mounting face  Retreated towards the temples, and what there  Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears  From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,  Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd  Into due size protuberant the lips.  He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends  His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears  Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.  His tongue continuous before and apt  For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork  Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.  The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,  Hissing along the vale, and after him  The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd  His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few  Thus to another spake:  \"Along this path  Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!\"       So saw I fluctuate in successive change  Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:  And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events  So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes  Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.       Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well  I mark'd Sciancato:  he alone it was  Of the three first that came, who chang'd not:  thou,  The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue.        CANTO XXVI    FLORENCE exult!  for thou so mightily  Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings  Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!  Among the plund'rers such the three I found  Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,  And no proud honour to thyself redounds.       But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,  Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long  Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)  Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance  Were in good time, if it befell thee now.  Would so it were, since it must needs befall!  For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.       We from the depth departed; and my guide  Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late  We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep.  Pursuing thus our solitary way  Among the crags and splinters of the rock,  Sped not our feet without the help of hands.       Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,  As my thought turns again to what I saw,  And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb  The powers of nature in me, lest they run  Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good  My gentle star, or something better gave me,  I envy not myself the precious boon.       As in that season, when the sun least veils  His face that lightens all, what time the fly  Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then  Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees  Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,  Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:  With flames so numberless throughout its space  Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth  Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs  The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw  Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect  Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,  Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone  Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;  E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,  A sinner so enfolded close in each,  That none exhibits token of the theft.       Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,  And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,  Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark d  How I did gaze attentive, thus began:  \"Within these ardours are the spirits, each  Swath'd in confining fire.\"--\"Master, thy word,\"  I answer'd, \"hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd  Already of the truth, already wish'd  To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes  So parted at the summit, as it seem'd  Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay  The Theban brothers?\"  He replied:  \"Within  Ulysses there and Diomede endure  Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now  Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.  These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore  The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide  A portal for that goodly seed to pass,  Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile  Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft  Deidamia yet in death complains.  And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy  Of her Palladium spoil'd.\"--\"If they have power  Of utt'rance from within these sparks,\" said I,  \"O master!  think my prayer a thousand fold  In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe  To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.  See, how toward it with desire I bend.\"       He thus:  \"Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,  And I accept it therefore:  but do thou  Thy tongue refrain:  to question them be mine,  For I divine thy wish:  and they perchance,  For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.\"       When there the flame had come, where time and place  Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:  \"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!  If living I of you did merit aught,  Whate'er the measure were of that desert,  When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,  Move ye not on, till one of you unfold  In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd.\"       Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn  Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire  That labours with the wind, then to and fro  Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,  Threw out its voice, and spake:  \"When I escap'd  From Circe, who beyond a circling year  Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,  Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,  Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence  Of my old father, nor return of love,  That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,  Could overcome in me the zeal I had  T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,  Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd  Into the deep illimitable main,  With but one bark, and the small faithful band  That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,  Far as Morocco either shore I saw,  And the Sardinian and each isle beside  Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age  Were I and my companions, when we came  To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd  The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.  The walls of Seville to my right I left,  On the' other hand already Ceuta past.  \"O brothers!\"  I began, \"who to the west  Through perils without number now have reach'd,  To this the short remaining watch, that yet  Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof  Of the unpeopled world, following the track  Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:  Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes  But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.  With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage  The mind of my associates, that I then  Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn  Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight  Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.  Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,  And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor  It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft  Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon  Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far  Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought  Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,  But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land  A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side  Did strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl'd her round  With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up  The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:  And over us the booming billow clos'd.\"        CANTO XXVII    NOW upward rose the flame,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#16)"],[1,"eason, and that common  sense and cleverness when displayed by any other breathing thing were  merely instinct. The facts behind Henri's tale of woe struck him as  important, and until midnight they talked about the two strange wolves.    \"There is one big wolf an' one smaller,\" said Henri. \"An' it is always  the big wolf who goes in an' fights the lynx. I see that by the snow.  While he's fighting, the smaller wolf makes many tracks in the snow just  out of reach, an' then when the lynx is down, or dead, it jumps in an'  helps tear it into pieces. All that I know by the snow. Only once have I  seen where the smaller one went in an' fought with the other, an' then  there was blood all about that was not lynx blood; I trailed the devils  a mile by the dripping.\"    During the two weeks that followed, Weyman found much to add to the  material of his book. Not a day passed that somewhere along Henri's  trap-line they did not see the trails of the two wolves, and Weyman  observed that--as Henri had told him--the footprints were always two by  two, and never one by one. On the third day they came to a trap that had  held a lynx, and at sight of what remained Henri cursed in both French  and English until he was purple in the face. The lynx had been torn  until its pelt was practically worthless.    Weyman saw where the smaller wolf had waited on its haunches, while its  companion had killed the lynx. He did not tell Henri all he thought. But  the days that followed convinced him more and more that he had found the  most dramatic exemplification of his theory. Back of this mysterious  tragedy of the trap-line there was a _reason_.    Why did the two wolves not destroy the fisher-cat, the ermine and the  marten? Why was their feud with the lynx alone?    Weyman was strangely thrilled. He was a lover of wild things, and for  that reason he never carried a gun. And when he saw Henri placing  poison-baits for the two marauders, he shuddered, and when, day after  day, he saw that these poison-baits were untouched, he rejoiced.  Something in his own nature went out in sympathy to the heroic outlaw of  the trap-line who never failed to give battle to the lynx. Nights in the  cabin he wrote down his thoughts and discoveries of the day. One night  he turned suddenly on Henri.    \"Henri, doesn't it ever make you sorry to kill so many wild things?\" he  asked.    Henri stared and shook his head.    \"I kill t'ousand an' t'ousand,\" he said. \"I kill t'ousand more.\"    \"And there are twenty thousand others just like you in this northern  quarter of the continent--all killing, killing for hundreds of years  back, and yet you can't kill out wild life. The war of Man and the  Beast, you might call it. And, if you could return five hundred years  from now, Henri, you'd still find wild life here. Nearly all the rest of  the world is changing, but you can't change these almost impenetrable  thousands of square miles of ridges and swamps and forests. The  railroads won't come here, and I, for one, thank God for that. Take all  the great prairies to the west, for instance. Why, the old buffalo  trails are still there, plain as day--and yet, towns and cities are  growing up everywhere. Did you ever hear of North Battleford?\"    \"Is she near Montreal or Quebec?\" Henri asked.    Weyman smiled, and drew a photograph from his pocket. It was the picture  of a girl.    \"No. It's far to the west, in Saskatchewan. Seven years ago I used to  go up there every year, to shoot prairie chickens, coyotes and elk.  There wasn't any North Battleford then--just the glorious prairie,  hundreds and hundreds of square miles of it. There was a single shack on  the Saskatchewan River, where North Battleford now stands, and I used to  stay there. In that shack there was a little girl, twelve years old. We  used to go out hunting together--for I used to kill things in those  days. And the little girl would cry sometimes when I killed, and I'd  laugh at her.    \"Then a railroad came, and then another, and they joined near the shack,  and all at once a town sprang up. Seven years ago there was only the  shack there, Henri. Two years ago there were eighteen hundred people.  This year, when I came through, there were five thousand, and two years  from now there'll be ten thousand.    \"On the ground where that shack stood are three banks, with a capital of  forty million dollars; you can see the glow of the electric lights of  the city twenty miles away. It has a hundred-thousand dollar college, a  high school, the provincial asylum, a fire department, two clubs, a  board of trade, and it's going to have a street-car line within two  years. Think of that--all where the coyotes howled a few years ago!    \"People are coming in so fast that they can't keep a census. Five years  from now there'll be a city of twenty thousand where the old shack  stood. And the little girl in that shack, Henri--she's a young lady now,  and her people are--well, rich. I don't care about that. The chief thing  is that she is going to marry me in the spring. Because of her I stopped  killing things when she was only sixteen. The last thing I killed was a  prairie wolf, and it had young. Eileen kept the little puppy. She's got  it now--tamed. That's why above all other wild things I love the wolves.  And I hope these two leave your trap-line safe.\"    Henri was staring at him. Weyman gave him the picture. It was of a  sweet-faced girl, with deep pure eyes, and there came a twitch at the  corners of Henri's mouth as he looked at it.    \"My Iowaka died t'ree year ago,\" he said. \"She too loved the wild  thing. But them wolf--damn! They drive me out if I can not kill them!\"  He put fresh fuel into the stove, and prepared for bed.    One day the big idea came to Henri.    Weyman was with him when they struck fresh signs of lynx. There was a  great windfall ten or fifteen feet high, and in one place the logs had  formed a sort of cavern, with almost solid walls on three sides. The  snow was beaten down by tracks, and the fur of rabbit was scattered  about. Henri was jubilant.    \"We got heem--sure!\" he said.    He built the bait-house, set a trap and looked about him shrewdly. Then  he explained his scheme to Weyman. If the lynx was caught, and the two  wolves came to destroy it, the fight would take place in that shelter  under the windfall, and the marauders would have to pass through the  opening. So Henri set five smaller traps, concealing them skilfully  under leaves and moss and snow, and all were far enough away from the  bait-house so that the trapped lynx could not spring them in his  struggles.    \"When they fight, wolf jump this way an' that--an' sure get in,\" said  Henri. \"He miss one, two, t'ree--but he sure get in trap somewhere.\"    That same morning a light snow fell, making the work more complete, for  it covered up all footprints and buried the telltale scent of man. That  night Kazan and Gray Wolf passed within a hundred feet of the windfall,  and Gray Wolf's keen scent detected something strange and disquieting in  the air. She informed Kazan by pressing her shoulder against his, and  they swung off at right angles, keeping to windward of the trap-line.    For two days and three cold starlit nights nothing happened at the  windfall. Henri understood, and explained to Weyman. The lynx was a  hunter, like himself, and also had its hunt-line, which it covered about  once a week. On the fifth night the lynx returned, went to the windfall,  was lured straight to the bait, and the sharp-toothed steel trap closed  relentlessly over its right hindfoot. Kazan and Gray Wolf were traveling  a quarter of a mile deeper in the forest when they heard the clanking of  the steel chain as the lynx fought; to free itself. Ten minutes later  they stood in the door of the windfall cavern.    It was a white clear night, so filled with brilliant stars that Henri  himself could have hunted by the light of them. The lynx had exhausted  itself, and lay crouching on its belly as Kazan and Gray Wolf appeared.  As usual, Gray Wolf held back while Kazan began the battle. In the first  or second of these fights on the trap-line, Kazan would probably have  been disemboweled or had his jugular vein cut open, had the fierce cats  been free. They were more than his match in open fight, though the  biggest of them fell ten pounds under his weight. Chance had saved him  on the Sun Rock. Gray Wolf and the porcupine had both added to the  defeat of the lynx on the sand-bar. And along Henri's hunting line it  was the trap that was his ally. Even with his enemy thus shackled he  took big chances. And he took bigger chances than ever with the lynx  under the windfall.    The cat was an old warrior, six or seven years old. His claws were an  inch and a quarter long, and curved like simitars. His forefeet and his  left hindfoot were free, and as Kazan advanced, he drew back, so that  the trap-chain was slack under his body. Here Kazan could not follow his  old tactics of circling about his trapped foe, until it had become  tangled in the chain, or had so shortened and twisted it that there was  no chance for a leap. He had to attack face to face, and suddenly he  lunged in. They met shoulder to shoulder. Kazan's fangs snapped at the  other's throat, and missed. Before he could strike again, the lynx flung  out its free hindfoot, and even Gray Wolf heard the ripping sound that  it made. With a snarl Kazan was flung back, his shoulder torn to the  bone.    Then it was that one of Henri's hidden traps saved him from a second  attack--and death. Steel jaws snapped over one of his forefeet, and when  he leaped, the chain stopped him. Once or twice before, blind Gray Wolf  had leaped in, when she knew that Kazan was in great danger. For an  instant she forgot her caution now, and as she heard Kazan's snarl of  pain, she sprang in under the windfall. Five traps Henri had hidden in  the space in front of the bait-house, and Gray"]]]
