So much for myself.    The door had not been closed ten seconds, ere Smith again was spitting  out the gag, swearing under his breath, and stretching his cramped limbs  free from their binding. Within a minute from the time of my trussing,  I was a free man again; save that look where I would--to right, to left,  or inward, to my own conscience--two dark eyes met mine, enigmatically.    \"What now?\" I whispered.    \"Let me think,\" replied Smith. \"A false move would destroy us.\"    \"How long have you been here?\"    \"Since last night.\"    \"Is Fu-Manchu--\"    \"Fu-Manchu is here!\" replied Smith, grimly--\"and not only Fu-Manchu,  but--another.\"    \"Another!\"    \"A higher than Fu-Manchu, apparently. I have an idea of the identity of  this person, but no more than an idea. Something unusual is going on,  Petrie; otherwise I should have been a dead man twenty-four hours  ago. Something even more important than my death engages Fu-Manchu's  attention--and this can only be the presence of the mysterious visitor.  Your seductive friend, Karamaneh, is arrayed in her very becoming  national costume in his honor, I presume.\" He stopped abruptly; then  added: \"I would give five hundred pounds for a glimpse of that visitor's  face!\"    \"Is Burke--\"    \"God knows what has become of Burke, Petrie! We were both caught napping  in the establishment of the amiable Shen-Yan, where, amid a very mixed  company of poker players, we were losing our money like gentlemen.\"    \"But Weymouth--\"    \"Burke and I had both been neatly sand-bagged, my dear Petrie, and  removed elsewhere, some hours before Weymouth raided the gaming-house.  Oh! I don't know how they smuggled us away with the police watching the  place; but my presence here is sufficient evidence of the fact. Are you  armed?\"    \"No; my pistol was in my raincoat, which is missing.\"    In the dim light from the broken window, I could see Smith tugging  reflectively at the lobe of his left ear.    \"I am without arms, too,\" he mused. \"We might escape from the window--\"    \"It's a long drop!\"    \"Ah! I imagined so. If only I had a pistol, or a revolver--\"    \"What should you do?\"    \"I should present myself before the important meeting, which, I am  assured, is being held somewhere in this building; and to-night would  see the end of my struggle with the Fu-Manchu group--the end of the  whole Yellow menace! For not only is Fu-Manchu here, Petrie, with all  his gang of assassins, but he whom I believe to be the real head of the  group--a certain mandarin--is here also!\"        CHAPTER XIII. THE SACRED ORDER    Smith stepped quietly across the room and tried the door. It proved to  be unlocked, and an instant later, we were both outside in the passage.  Coincident with our arrival there, arose a sudden outcry from some place  at the westward end. A high-pitched, grating voice, in which guttural  notes alternated with a serpent-like hissing, was raised in anger.    \"Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" whispered Smith, grasping my arm.    Indeed, it was the unmistakable voice of the Chinaman, raised  hysterically in one of those outbursts which in the past I had diagnosed  as symptomatic of dangerous mania.    The voice rose to a scream, the scream of some angry animal rather than  anything human. Then, chokingly, it ceased. Another short sharp cry  followed--but not in the voice of Fu-Manchu--a dull groan, and the sound  of a fall.    With Smith still grasping my wrist, I shrank back into the doorway, as  something that looked in the darkness like a great ball of fluff came  rapidly along the passage toward me. Just at my feet the thing stopped  and I made it out for a small animal. The tiny, gleaming eyes looked up  at me, and, chattering wickedly, the creature bounded past and was lost  from view.    It was Dr. Fu-Manchu's marmoset.    Smith dragged me back into the room which we had just left. As he partly  reclosed the door, I heard the clapping of hands. In a condition of  most dreadful suspense, we waited; until a new, ominous sound proclaimed  itself. Some heavy body was being dragged into the passage. I heard the  opening of a trap. Exclamations in guttural voices told of a heavy task  in progress; there was a great straining and creaking--whereupon the  trap was softly reclosed.    Smith bent to my ear.    \"Fu-Manchu has chastised one of his servants,\" he whispered. \"There will  be food for the grappling-irons to-night!\"    I shuddered violently, for, without Smith's words, I knew that a bloody  deed had been done in that house within a few yards of where we stood.    In the new silence, I could hear the drip, drip, drip of the rain  outside the window; then a steam siren hooted dismally upon the river,  and I thought how the screw of that very vessel, even as we listened,  might be tearing the body of Fu-Manchu's servant!    \"Have you some one waiting?\" whispered Smith, eagerly.    \"How long was I insensible?\"    \"About half an hour.\"    \"Then the cabman will be waiting.\"    \"Have you a whistle with you?\"    I felt in my coat pocket.    \"Yes,\" I reported.    \"Good! Then we will take a chance.\"    Again we slipped out into the passage and began a stealthy progress  to the west. Ten paces amid absolute darkness, and we found ourselves  abreast of a branch corridor. At the further end, through a kind of  little window, a dim light shone.    \"See if you can find the trap,\" whispered Smith; \"light your lamp.\"    I directed the ray of the pocket-lamp upon the floor, and there at my  feet was a square wooden trap. As I stooped to examine it, I glanced  back, painfully, over my shoulder--and saw Nayland Smith tiptoeing away  from me along the passage toward the light!    Inwardly I cursed his folly, but the temptation to peep in at that  little window proved too strong for me, as it had proved too strong for  him.    Fearful that some board would creak beneath my tread, I followed; and  side by side we two crouched, looking into a small rectangular room. It  was a bare and cheerless apartment with unpapered walls and carpetless  floor. A table and a chair constituted the sole furniture.    Seated in the chair, with his back toward us, was a portly Chinaman who  wore a yellow, silken robe. His face, it was impossible to see; but he  was beating his fist upon the table, and pouring out a torrent of words  in a thin, piping voice. So much I perceived at a glance; then, into  view at the distant end of the room, paced a tall, high-shouldered  figure--a figure unforgettable, at once imposing and dreadful, stately  and sinister.    With the long, bony hands behind him, fingers twining and intertwining  serpentinely about the handle of a little fan, and with the pointed chin  resting on the breast of the yellow robe, so that the light from the  lamp swinging in the center of the ceiling gleamed upon the great,  dome-like brow, this tall man paced somberly from left to right.    He cast a sidelong, venomous glance at the voluble speaker out of  half-shut eyes; in the act they seemed to light up as with an internal  luminance; momentarily they sparkled like emeralds; then their  brilliance was filmed over as in the eyes of a bird when the membrane is  lowered.    My blood seemed to chill, and my heart to double its pulsations;  beside me Smith was breathing more rapidly than usual. I knew now  the explanation of the feeling which had claimed me when first I had  descended the stone stairs. I knew what it was that hung like a miasma  over that house. It was the aura, the glamour, which radiated from this  wonderful and evil man as light radiates from radium. It was the vril,  the force, of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    I began to move away from the window. But Smith held my wrist as in a  vise. He was listening raptly to the torrential speech of the Chinaman  who sat in the chair; and I perceived in his eyes the light of a sudden  comprehension.    As the tall figure of the Chinese doctor came pacing into view again,  Smith, his head below the level of the window, pushed me gently along  the passage.    Regaining the site of the trap, he whispered to me: \"We owe our lives,  Petrie, to the national childishness of the Chinese! A race of ancestor  worshipers is capable of anything, and Dr. Fu-Manchu, the dreadful being  who has rained terror upon Europe stands in imminent peril of disgrace  for having lost a decoration.\"    \"What do you mean, Smith?\"    \"I mean that this is no time for delay, Petrie! Here, unless I am  greatly mistaken, lies the rope by means of which you made your  entrance. It shall be the means of your exit. Open the trap!\"    Handling the lamp to Smith, I stooped and carefully raised the  trap-door. At which moment, a singular and dramatic thing happened.    A softly musical voice--the voice of my dreams!--spoke.    \"Not that way! O God, not that way!\"    In my surprise and confusion I all but let the trap fall, but I retained  sufficient presence of mind to replace it gently. Standing upright, I  turned... and there, with her little jeweled hand resting upon Smith's  arm, stood Karamaneh!    In all my experience of him, I had never seen Nayland Smith so utterly  perplexed. Between anger, distrust and dismay, he wavered; and each  passing emotion was written legibly upon the lean bronzed features.  Rigid with surprise, he stared at the beautiful face of the girl. She,  although her hand still rested upon Smith's arm, had her dark eyes  turned upon me with that same enigmatical expression. Her lips were  slightly parted, and her breast heaved tumultuously.    This ten seconds of silence in which we three stood looking at one  another encompassed the whole gamut of human emotion. The silence was  broken by Karamaneh.    \"They will be coming"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#16)"],[1,"felt steady and  quiet beneath one's feet, but quivered and jarred. It was a confusing,  unsteady place, and enough to send anyone's thoughts jerking into odd  zigzags. And for three months, while the big strike of the engineers was  in progress, Holroyd, who was a blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere  black, were never out of the stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the  little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates.    Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine  soon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. \"Look at  that,\" said Holroyd; \"where's your 'eathen idol to match 'im?\" And  Azuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi  heard: \"Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent, on the ordinary shares,\" said  Holroyd, \"and that's something like a Gord.\"    Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and  power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and  the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium.  He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which  a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample  of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of his labour--it was  heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd's--Azuma-zi  would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the brushes would  sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear, but all the  rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The band ran shouting over  the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of  the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy shed, with him and  Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as  the other engines he knew--mere captive devils of the British Solomon--had  been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller dynamos Azuma-zi by force  of contrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord of  the Dynamos. They were fretful and irregular, but the big dynamo was  steady. How great it was! How serene and easy in its working! Greater and  calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not  motionless, but living! The great black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings  ran round under the brushes, and the deep note of its coil steadied the  whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly.    Azuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord of  the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get  whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind  the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for  it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand close to the  colossus, and look up at the great leather band running overhead. There  was a black patch on the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow  among all the clatter to watch this return again and again. Odd thoughts  spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people tell us that savages give  souls to rocks and trees,--and a machine is a thousand times more alive  than a rock or a tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage still; the  veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit, his bruises, and  the coal grime on his face and hands. His father before him had worshipped  a meteoric stone, kindred blood, it may be, had splashed the broad wheels  of Juggernaut.    He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the  great dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until  the metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of  service in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning coils  gently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people in London  hid their gods.    At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts,  and at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he  salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then, when Holroyd was away, he  went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant, and  prayed it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a  rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing  machine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was  radiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable  to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and he  had indeed been very much alone in London. And even when his work-time was  over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed.    Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to the  Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, \"Thou seest, O my Lord!\" and the angry  whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it appeared to him  that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the  sounds of the dynamo. \"My Lord bides his time,\" said Azuma-zi to himself.  \"The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe.\" And he waited and watched for  the day of reckoning. One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and  Holroyd, making an unwary examination--it was in the afternoon--got a  rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him jump off and  curse at the peccant coil.    \"He is warned,\" said Azuma-zi to himself. \"Surely my Lord is very  patient.\"    Holroyd had at first initiated his \"nigger\" into such elementary  conceptions of the dynamo's working as would enable him to take temporary  charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the manner in which  Azuma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious. He dimly perceived  his assistant was \"up to something,\" and connecting him with the anointing  of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued  an edict, shouted above the confusion of the machinery, \"Don't 'ee go nigh  that big dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a'll take thy skin off!\" Besides,  if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was plain sense and  decency to keep him away from it.    Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the  Lord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he  turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and  glared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery took  a new rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue.    It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The  incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little  store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy, at last, into  something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a  sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him  with a strange tumult of exultant emotion.    That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed  together. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and  flickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball  governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their pistons  beat loud and steady. The world outside seen through the open end of the  shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely silent, too,  since the riot of the machinery drowned every external sound. Far away was  the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind, and above was  the deep blue sky and the pale little stars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked  across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running,  and went into the shadow by the big dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the  spin of the armature changed.    \"What are you dewin' with that switch?\" he bawled in surprise. \"Han't I  told you----\"    Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi's eyes as the Asiatic came out  of the shadow towards him.    In another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the  great dynamo.    \"You coffee-headed fool!\" gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his throat.  \"Keep off those contact rings.\" In another moment he was tripped and  reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively loosened his  grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine.    The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had  happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter's lodge by the  gate. Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could make  nothing of the black's incoherent English, and hurried on to the shed.  The machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be  disarranged. There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he saw  an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, and,  approaching, recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.    The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut his  eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so that he  should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice and  help.    When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had been  a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt strangely  elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon him. His plan  was already settled when he met the man coming from the station, and the  scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious  conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to  ask a few questions. Did he see Holroyd kill himself? Azuma-zi explained  he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference  in the noise from the dynamo. It was not a difficult examination, being  untinctured by suspicion.    The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from  the machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained  table-cloth. Somebody, by a happy "]]]
