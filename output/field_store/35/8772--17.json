Psamtik descended the steps to welcome the strangers. His austere,  sallow face endeavored to assume a smile. The high officials in his  train bowed down nearly to the ground, allowing their arms to hang  loosely at their sides. The Persians, crossing their hands on their  breasts, cast themselves on the earth before the heir to the Egyptian  throne. When the first formalities were over, Bartja, according to the  custom of his native country, but greatly to the astonishment of the  populace, who were totally unaccustomed to such a sight, kissed the  sallow cheek of the Egyptian prince; who shuddered at the touch of a  stranger's unclean lips, then took his way to the litters waiting to  convey him and his escort to the dwelling designed for them by the king,  in the palace at Sais.    A portion of the crowd streamed after the strangers, but the larger  number remained at their places, knowing that many a new and wonderful  sight yet awaited them.    \"Are you going to run after those dressed-up monkeys and children of  Typhon, too?\" asked an angry priest of his neighbor, a respectable  tailor of Sais. \"I tell you, Puhor, and the high-priest says so too,  that these strangers can bring no good to the black land! I am for the  good old times, when no one who cared for his life dared set foot on  Egyptian soil. Now our streets are literally swarming with cheating  Hebrews, and above all with those insolent Greeks whom may the gods  destroy!       [The Jews were called Hebrews (Apuriu) by the Egyptians; as brought     to light by Chabas. See Ebers, Aegypten I. p. 316. H. Brugsch     opposes this opinion.]    \"Only look, there is the third boat full of strangers! And do you know  what kind of people these Persians are? The high-priest says that in the  whole of their kingdom, which is as large as half the world, there  is not a single temple to the gods; and that instead of giving decent  burial to the dead, they leave them to be torn in pieces by dogs and  vultures.\"       [These statements are correct, as the Persians, at the time of the     dynasty of the Achaemenidae, had no temples, but used fire-altars     and exposed their dead to the dogs and vultures. An impure corpse     was not permitted to defile the pure earth by its decay; nor might     it be committed to the fire or water for destruction, as their     purity would be equally polluted by such an act. But as it was     impossible to cause the dead bodies to vanish, Dakhmas or burying-     places were laid out, which had to be covered with pavement and     cement not less than four inches thick, and surrounded by cords to     denote that the whole structure was as it were suspended in the air,     and did not come in contact with the pure earth. Spiegel, Avesta     II.]    \"The tailor's indignation at hearing this was even greater than his  astonishment, and pointing to the landing-steps, he cried:    \"It is really too bad; see, there is the sixth boat full of these  foreigners!\"    \"Yes, it is hard indeed!\" sighed the priest, \"one might fancy a whole  army arriving. Amasis will go on in this manner until the strangers  drive him from his throne and country, and plunder and make slaves of  us poor creatures, as the evil Hyksos, those scourges of Egypt, and the  black Ethiopians did, in the days of old.\"    \"The seventh boat!\" shouted the tailor.    \"May my protectress Neith, the great goddess of Sais, destroy me, if I  can understand the king,\" complained the priest. \"He sent three barks to  Naukratis, that poisonous nest hated of the gods, to fetch the servants  and baggage of these Persians; but instead of three, eight had to be  procured, for these despisers of the gods and profaners of dead bodies  have not only brought kitchen utensils, dogs, horses, carriages, chests,  baskets and bales, but have dragged with them, thousands of miles, a  whole host of servants. They tell me that some of them have no other  work than twining of garlands and preparing ointments. Their priests  too, whom they call Magi, are here with them. I should like to know what  they are for? of what use is a priest where there is no temple?\"    The old King Amasis received the Persian embassy shortly after their  arrival with all the amiability and kindness peculiar to him.    Four days later, after having attended to the affairs of state, a duty  punctually fulfilled by him every morning without exception, he went  forth to walk with Croesus in the royal gardens. The remaining members  of the embassy, accompanied by the crown-prince, were engaged in an  excursion up the Nile to the city of Memphis.    The palace-gardens, of a royal magnificence, yet similar in their  arrangement to those of Rhodopis, lay in the north-west part of Sais,  near the royal citadel.    Here, under the shadow of a spreading plane-tree, and near a gigantic  basin of red granite, into which an abundance of clear water flowed  perpetually through the jaws of black basalt crocodiles, the two old men  seated themselves.    The dethroned king, though in reality some years the elder of the two,  looked far fresher and more vigorous than the powerful monarch at his  side. Amasis was tall, but his neck was bent; his corpulent body was  supported by weak and slender legs: and his face, though well-formed,  was lined and furrowed. But a vigorous spirit sparkled in the small,  flashing eyes, and an expression of raillery, sly banter, and at times,  even of irony, played around his remarkably full lips. The low, broad  brow, the large and beautifully-arched head bespoke great mental power,  and in the changing color of his eyes one seemed to read that neither  wit nor passion were wanting in the man, who, from his simple place  as soldier in the ranks, had worked his way up to the throne of the  Pharaohs. His voice was sharp and hard, and his movements, in comparison  with the deliberation of the other members of the Egyptian court,  appeared almost morbidly active.    The attitude and bearing of his neighbor Croesus were graceful, and in  every way worthy of a king. His whole manner showed that he had lived  in frequent intercourse with the highest and noblest minds of Greece.  Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes of Miletus, Bias of Priene, Solon of  Athens, Pittakus of Lesbos, the most celebrated Hellenic philosophers,  had in former and happier days been guests at the court of Croesus in  Sardis. His full clear voice sounded like pure song when compared with  the shrill tones of Amasis.       [Bias, a philosopher of Ionian origin, flourished about 560 B. C.     and was especially celebrated for his wise maxims on morals and law.     After his death, which took place during his defence of a friend in     the public court, a temple was erected to him by his countrymen.     Laert. Diog. I. 88.]    \"Now tell me openly,\" began king Pharaoh--[In English \"great house,\" the  high gate or \"sublime porte.\"]--in tolerably fluent Greek, \"what opinion  hast thou formed of Egypt? Thy judgment possesses for me more worth than  that of any other man, for three reasons: thou art better acquainted  with most of the countries and nations of this earth; the gods have not  only allowed thee to ascend the ladder of fortune to its utmost summit,  but also to descend it, and thirdly, thou hast long been the first  counsellor to the mightiest of kings. Would that my kingdom might please  thee so well that thou wouldst remain here and become to me a brother.  Verily, Croesus, my friend hast thou long been, though my eyes beheld  thee yesterday for the first time!\"    \"And thou mine,\" interrupted the Lydian. \"I admire the courage with  which thou hast accomplished that which seemed right and good in thine  eyes, in spite of opposition near and around thee. I am thankful for the  favor shown to the Hellenes, my friends, and I regard thee as related to  me by fortune, for hast thou not also passed through all the extremes of  good and evil that this life can offer?\"    \"With this difference,\" said Amasis smiling, \"that we started from  opposite points; in thy lot the good came first, the evil later; whereas  in my own this order has been reversed. In saying this, however,\" he  added, \"I am supposing that my present fortune is a good for me, and  that I enjoy it.\"    \"And I, in that case,\" answered Croesus, \"must be assuming that I am  unhappy in what men call my present ill-fortune.\"    \"How can it possibly be otherwise after the loss of such enormous  possessions?\"    \"Does happiness consist then in possession?\" asked Croesus. \"Is  happiness itself a thing to be possessed? Nay, by no means! It is  nothing but a feeling, a sensation, which the envious gods vouchsafe  more often to the needy than to the mighty. The clear sight of the  latter becomes dazzled by the glittering treasure, and they cannot but  suffer continual humiliation, because, conscious of possessing power to  obtain much, they wage an eager war for all, and therein are continually  defeated.\"    Amasis sighed, and answered: \"I would I could prove thee in the wrong;  but in looking back on my past life I am fain to confess that its  cares began with that very hour which brought me what men call my good  fortune.\"--\"And I,\" interrupted Croesus, \"can assure thee that I am  thankful thou delayedst to come to my help, inasmuch as the hour of my  overthrow was the beginning of true, unsullied happiness. When I beheld  the first Persians scale the walls of Sardis, I execrated myself and the  gods, life appeared odious to me, existence a curse. Fighting on, but in  heart despairing, I and my people were forced to yield.

Your grief is the best side of you, and  of that you do indeed allow them to catch a glimpse; but where the pain  is you carefully conceal. Every good man longs to heal a wound when he  sees it, but your whole demeanor cries out: 'Stay where you are, and  leave me in peace.'--If only you were good to your uncle!\"    \"But I am, and I have felt prompted a hundred times to confide in  him--but then...\"    \"Well--then?\"    \"Only look at him, Betta; see how he lies as cold as marble, rigid and  apathetic, half dead and half alive. At first the words often rose to my  lips...\"    \"And now?\"    \"Now all the worst is so long past; I feel I have forfeited the right to  complain to him of all that weighs me down.\"    \"Hm,\" said Perpetua who had no answer ready. \"But take heart, my child.  Orion has at any rate learnt how far he may venture. You can hold your  head high enough and look cool enough. Bear all that cannot be mended,  and if an inward voice does not deceive me, he whom we seek...\"    \"That was what brought me here. Are none of our messengers returned  yet?\"    \"Yes, the little Nabathaean is come,\" replied her nurse with some  hesitation, \"and he indeed--but for God's sake, child, form no vain  hopes! Hiram came to me soon after sun-down...\"    \"Betta!\" screamed the girl, clinging to her nurse's arm. \"What has he  heard, what news does he bring?\"    \"Nothing, nothing! How you rush at conclusions! What he found out  is next to nothing. I had only a minute to speak to Hiram. To-morrow  morning he is to bring the man to me. The only thing he told me...\"    \"By Christ's Wounds! What was it?\"    \"He said that the messenger had heard of an elderly recluse, who had  formerly been a great warrior.\"    \"My father, my father!\" cried Paula. \"Hiram is sitting by the fire with  the others. Fetch him here at once--at once; I command you, Perpetua, do  you hear? Oh best, dearest Betta! Come with me; we will go to him.\"    \"Patience, sweetheart, a little patience!\" urged the nurse. \"Ah, poor  dear soul, it will turn out to be nothing again; and if we again follow  up a false clue it will only lead to fresh disappointment.\"    \"Never mind: you are to come with me.\"    \"To all the servants round the fire, and at this time of night? I should  think so indeed!--But do you wait here, child. I know how it can be  managed.    \"I will wake Hiram's Joseph. He sleeps in the stable yonder--and then  he will fetch his father. Ah! what impatience! What a stormy, passionate  little heart it is! If I do not do your bidding, I shall have you awake  all night, and wandering about to-morrow as if in a dream.--There, be  quiet, be quiet, I am going.\"    As she spoke she wrapped her kerchief round her head and hurried out;  Paula fell on her knees before the crucifix over the bed, and prayed  fervently till her nurse returned, Soon after she heard a man's steps on  the stairs and Hiram came in.    He was a powerful man of about fifty, with a pair of honest blue eyes in  his plain face. Any one looking at his broad chest would conclude that  when he spoke it would be in a deep bass voice; but Hiram had stammered  from his infancy; and from constant companionship with horses he had  accustomed himself to make a variety of strange, inarticulate noises in  a high, shrill voice. Besides, he was always unwilling to speak. When  he found himself face to face with the daughter of his master and  benefactor, he knelt at her feet, looked up at her with faithful,  dog-like eyes full of affection, and kissed first her dress, and then  her hand which she held out to him. Paula kindly but decidedly cut  short the expressions of delight at seeing her again which he painfully  stammered out; and when he at length began to tell his story his words  came far too slowly for her impatience.    He told her that the Nabathaean who had brought the rumor that had  excited her hopes, was not unwilling to follow up the trace he had  found, but he would not wait beyond noon the next day and had tried to  bid for high terms.    \"He shall have them--as much as he wants!\" cried Paula. \"But Hiram  entreated her, more by looks and vague cries than by articulate words,  not to hope for too much. Dusare the Nabathaean--Perpetua now took up  the tale--had heard of a recluse, living at Raithu on the Red Sea, who  had been a great warrior, by birth a Greek, and who for two years  had been leading a life of penance in great seclusion among the pious  brethren on the sacred Mount of Sinai. The messenger had not been able  to learn what his name in the world had been, but among the hermits he  was known as Paulus.\"    \"Paulus!\" interrupted the girl with panting breath. \"A name that must  remind him of my mother and of me, yes, of me! And he, the hero of  Damascus, who was called Thomas in the world, believing that I was dead,  has no doubt dedicated himself to the service of God and of Christ, and  has taken the name of Paulus, as Saul, the other man of Damascus did  after his con version,--exactly like him! Oh! Betta, Hiram, you will  see: it is he, it must be! How can you doubt it?\"    The Syrian shook his head doubtfully and gave vent to a long-drawn  whistle, and Perpetua clasped her hands exclaiming distressfully: \"Did  I not say so? She takes the fire lighted by shepherds at night to warm  their hands for the rising sun--the rattle of chariots for the thunders  of the Almighty!--Why, how many thousands have called themselves Paulus!  By all the Saints, child, I beseech you keep quiet, and do not try to  weave a holiday-robe out of airy mist! Be prepared for the worst; then  you are armed against failure and preserve your right to hope! Tell her,  tell her, Hiram, what else the messenger said; it is nothing positive;  everything is as uncertain as dust in the breeze.\"    The freedman then explained that this Nabathaean was a trustworthy man,  far better skilled in such errands than himself, for he understood both  Syriac and Egyptian, Greek and Aramaic; and nevertheless he had failed  to find out anything more about this hermit Paulus at Tor, where  the monks of the monastery of the Transfiguration had a colony.  Subsequently, however, on the sea voyage to Holzum, he had been informed  by some monks that there was a second Sinai. The monastery there--but  here Perpetua again was the speaker, for the hapless stammerer's  brow was beaded with sweat--the monastery at the foot of the peaked,  heaven-kissing mountain, had been closed in consequence of the heresies  of its inhabitants; but in the gorges of these great heights there  were still many recluses, some in a small Coenobium, some in Lauras and  separate caves, and among these perchance Paulus might be found. This  clue seemed a good one and she and Hiram had already made up their minds  to follow it up; but the warrior monk was very possibly a stranger,  and they had thought it would be cruel to expose her to so keen a  disappointment.    Here Paula interrupted her, crying in joyful excitement:    \"And why should not something besides disappointment be my portion for  once? How could you have the heart to deprive me of the hope on which my  poor heart still feeds?--But I will not be robbed of it. Your Paulus  of Sinai is my lost father. I feel it, I know it! If I had not sold my  pearls, the Nabathaean.... But as it is. When can you start, my good  Hiram?\"    \"Not before a fort--a fortnight at--at--at--soonest,\" said the man. \"I  am in the governor's service now, and the day after to-morrow is the  great horse-fair at Niku. The young master wants some stallions bought  and there are our foals to....\"    \"I will implore my uncle to-morrow, to spare you,\" cried Paula. \"I will  go on my knees to him.\"    \"He will not let him go,\" said the nurse. \"Sebek the steward told him  all about it from me before the hour of audience and tried to have Hiram  released.\"    \"And he said...?\"    \"The lady Neforis said it was all a mere will-o'-the-wisp, and my lord  agreed with her. Then your uncle forbade Sebek to betray the matter to  you, and sent word to me that he would possibly send Hiram to Sinai  when the horse-fair was over. So take patience, sweetheart. What are two  weeks, or at most three--and then....\"    \"But I shall die before then!\" cried Paula. \"The Nabathaean, you say, is  here and willing to go.\"    \"Yes, Mistress.\"    \"Then we will secure him,\" said Paula resolutely. Perpetua, however, who  must have discussed the matter fully with her fellow-countryman, shook  her head mournfully and said: \"He asks too much for us!\"    She then explained that the man, being such a good linguist, had already  been offered an engagement to conduct a caravan to Ctesiphon. This  would be a year's pay to him, and he was not inclined to break off his  negotiations with the merchant Hanno and search the deserts of Arabia  Petraea for less than two thousand drachmae.    \"Two thousand drachmae!\" echoed Paula, looking down in distress  and confusion; but she presently looked up and exclaimed with angry  determination: \"How dare they keep from me that which is my own? If my  uncle refuses what I have to ask, and will ask, then the inevitable must  happen, though for his sake it will grieve me; I must put my affairs in  the hands of the judges.\"    \"The judges?\" Perpetua smiled. \"But you cannot lay a complaint without  your kyrios, and your uncle is yours. Besides: before they have settled  the matter the messenger may have been to Ctesiphon and back, far as it  is.\"    Again her nurse entreated her to have patience till the horse-fair  should be over. Paula fixed her eyes on the ground. She seemed quite  crushed; but Perpetua started violently and Hiram drew back a step when  she suddenly broke out in a loud, joyful cry of \"Father in Heaven, I  have what we need!\"    \"How, child, what?\" asked the nurse, pressing her hand to her heart. But  Paula vouchsafed no information; she turned quickly"]]]
