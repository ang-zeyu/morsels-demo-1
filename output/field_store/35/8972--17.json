This increased flow is  beneficial in clearing out any bile stagnating in the gall-bladder. A  subsequent increase in the quantity of bile indicates a greater flow of  bile into the gall-bladder, and this also is of service in emptying out  any stagnant bile, and restoring the normal condition when this is  disturbed. Artificial solutions of alkaline salts were found to have a  similar action to the natural mineral waters, and, as with them, the  action varies according to the concentration of the solution.  Bicarbonate of sodium has a quicker, more powerful, and more lasting  effect on the composition of the bile than the sulphate of sodium, and  weak solutions than strong ones. Vichy was more efficacious than  Carlsbad water. Hot water was found to have an effect on the bile much  like that of the mineral waters.           *       *       *       *       *          VIVISECTION.      Although Magendie is rightly considered the true initiator of  experimentation upon living beings, the practice of vivisection is as  old as science itself.    Galien, the physician of Marcus Aurelius (in the second century of the  Christian era), dissected living animals, and yet he is regarded as  having merited his name (_Galenus_, \"gentle\") from the mildness of his  character. Five centuries before him, under the Ptolemies, Egyptian  experimenters had operated upon condemned persons. So, then, vivisection  is not, as usually thought, a diabolical invention of modern science.    [Illustration: Fig. 1-5 APPARATUS USED IN VIVISECTION.]    In all ages the necessity has been recognized of operating upon animals  that are nearest allied to man, such as the monkey, the hog, and the  dog, and who share with the king of creation the privilege of eating a  little of everything. Claude Bernard, however, had another way of  looking at things. It is true that he especially made researches into  the general laws of physiology, the secret of the vital functions, and  the operation of the various organic systems that constitute living  matter, but his immediate object was not to furnish weapons for the art  of curing. He left to physicians and surgeons the care of drawing  conclusions from his great work in biology, and of acting experimentally  upon animals allied to man in order to found a rational system of  therapeutics. So he preferred to operate upon beings placed low in the  animal scale--the frog especially, an animal that has rendered him  greater service than even man himself could have done. Cold-blooded  animals offer, moreover, the advantage of being less impressionable than  others, and the experiments to which they are submitted present more  accurate conclusions, since it is not necessary to take so much account  of the victim's restlessness. And then it is necessary in many cases to  choose subjects that possess endurance. The unfortunate frog, so aptly  named \"the Job of physiology,\" becomes resigned to living under most  dreadful conditions, and when, through sheer exhaustion, he has  succumbed, his twitching limbs may still he used as an object of  experimentation for twenty-four hours. Thanks are due to nature for  giving so extraordinary a vitality to the tissues of a modest  batrachian! We owe to it the famous experiment of Galvani that led Volta  to the discovery of the pile and what followed it, the astonishing  conquests of electricity and those more marvelous ones still that are  now in their dawn. Science is much indebted to the frog, and may the  homage that we pay him help to alleviate the sufferings that have been  imposed upon this brave animal!    [Illustration: Fig. 6-8 APPARATUS USED IN VIVISECTION.]    The simple fact that we have just enunciated pleads loudly enough for  the cause of vivisection to make it useless to defend it. No one,  however, has risen to ask for an absolute proscription of it, but it is  only desired that the abuse of an abominable practice shall be curbed.  Does the abuse exist? That is the question, and it may be answered in  the affirmative. Yes, we do sometimes impose useless sufferings upon  animals. It is a culpable folly, a beastly cruelty, to constantly repeat  barbarous experiments with the object of exhibiting a well known  physical fact, a hundred times verified and always the same, when it  would only be necessary to enunciate it. But this is not the place to  expatiate upon the subject. After proclaiming the utility of  vivisection, we give it as our opinion that the practice of it should be  confined within narrow limits. It is not too much to ask that it be  confined to the privacy of laboratories, with the exclusion of visitors,  and to require from students a diploma guaranteeing their knowledge and  giving a programme of researches to be made. It is useless to seek in  the living what a study of the corpse reveals in all its details.    [Illustration: Fig. 9-11 APPARATUS USED IN VIVISECTION.]    And now, after these preliminary remarks, we present herewith a series  of cuts representing the various apparatus used in the practice of  vivisection, which are taken from a recent work by Claude Bernard.

[Footnote: Read at the late meeting of the National Association for the  Protection of the Insane and translated for the American Psychological  Journal by Carl Sieler, M.D., of Philadelphia.]    By A. BAER, M.D., of Berlin, Germany.      The benevolent efforts of your society diverge in two different  directions, which have totally different aims and purposes, and which  require different means in order to attain lasting success. Since the  number of insane has increased alarmingly within the last few years, in  all civilized countries, so that the responsibility of the proper charge  of them occupies continually not only the community, but also the State;  and since the public as well as the private asylums are filled almost  before they are finished, it becomes necessary to rid the institutions,  as soon as possible, of those patients which have been cured, as well as  of those which are improved. Patients of this kind are, as early as  possible, returned to the unrestrained enjoyment of liberty with the  expectation that the new scenes and surroundings may have a beneficial  influence, besides having the advantage of relieving the overcrowded  institutions. Unfortunately, however, it has been frequently found that  the hut suddenly restored mental and emotional equilibrium is not of  sufficient stability to withstand the storm of conflicting interests.  Frequently it happens that the but recently discharged patient returns  to the institution, after a short lapse of time, because the \"rudder\"  (steuer) of his intelligence was soon shattered in the turmoil of life.  How can, for instance, the indigent and poor patient, after his  discharge from the institution in which he has found a shelter and the  proper care, stand up in the struggle for existence and the support of  his family? Is it not to be expected that a large proportion of those  who have been discharged as improved, or even cured, cannot withstand  the ever-moving sea of the outside life and bear up under the turmoil  which constantly stirs mind and soul?    Starting with the recognition of this fact, societies of benevolent  people have been formed in all countries in which true civilization and  humanity are at work, to diminish or abolish social evils, whose object  is to assist the restored patient who has been discharged from the  institution, at a time when he is most in need of help and assistance.  Switzerland has taken the lead of all countries by her brilliant  example, and there these societies found the greatest encouragement. It  should be looked upon as a good sign of the spirit of modern times, that  the seed of true humanity, with astonishing rapidity, found its way, far  and wide, for the benefit of suffering mankind. Everywhere, in all  European countries, and also on the American continent, has this branch  of a truly noble thought become acclimated, and many societies have been  organized for the purpose of assisting cured insane patients, by aiding  them in obtaining suitable occupations, or by direct donations of money,  etc., with a view of preventing, if possible, a relapse of the disease.  May this portion of the work of your society be an ever-flowing fountain  of joy and satisfaction to your members!    Of much greater importance is the best portion of your work, namely,  _the prevention of insanity_. It is nevertheless true, and cannot be  doubted, that in all civilized countries insanity increases in a manner  which is out of proportion to the increase of the population. Much  thought has been given to the cause of this phenomenon, and physicians  as well as moralists, national economists as well as philosophers and  philanthropists, have endeavored to fathom the connection"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#16)"],[1," is so able to grasp and appropriate  all the elements of culture, to add to them from the stores of its own  spiritual endowment, and to give back to mankind richer gifts than it  received. It has \"enriched the store of traditional European culture  with new and independent ideas and ideals, and won a position in the great  community of civilized nations which none else could fill.\" \"Depth of  conviction, idealism, universality, the power to look beyond all the  limits of a finite existence, to sympathize with all that is human, to  traverse the realm of ideas in companionship with the noblest of all  nations and ages--this has at all times been the German characteristic;  this has been extolled as the prerogative of German culture.\" [A] To no  nation, except the German, has it been given to enjoy in its inner self  \"that which is given to mankind as a whole.\" We often see in other  nations a greater intensity of specialized ability, but never the same  capacity for generalization and absorption. It is this quality which  specially fits us for the leadership in the intellectual world, and  imposes on us the obligation to maintain that position.    [Footnote A: Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte,\" i., p. 95.]    There are numerous other tasks to be fulfilled if we are to discharge  our highest duty. They form the necessary platform from which we can  mount to the highest goal. These duties lie in the domains of science  and politics, and also in that borderland where science and politics  touch, and where the latter is often directly conditioned by the results  of scientific inquiry.    First and foremost it is German science which must regain its  superiority in unwearying and brilliant research in order to vindicate  our birthright. On the one hand, we must extend the theory of the  perceptive faculty; on the other, we must increase man's dominion over  Nature by exploring her hidden secrets, and thus make human work more  useful and remunerative. We must endeavour to find scientific solutions  of the great problems which deeply concern mankind. We need not restrict  ourselves to the sphere of pure theory, but must try to benefit  civilization by the practical results of research, and thus create  conditions of life in which a purer conception of the ideal life can  find its expression.    It is, broadly speaking, religious and social controversies which  exercise the most permanent influence on human existence, and condition  not only our future development, but the higher life generally. These  problems have occupied the minds of no people more deeply and  permanently than our own. Yet the revolutionary spirit, in spite of the  empty ravings of social democratic agitators, finds no place in Germany.  The German nature tends towards a systematic healthy development, which  works slowly in opposition to the different movements. The Germans thus  seem thoroughly qualified to settle in their own country the great  controversies which are rending other nations, and to direct them into  the paths of a natural progress in conformity with the laws of  evolution.    We have already started on the task in the social sphere, and shall no  doubt continue it, so far as it is compatible with the advantages of the  community and the working class itself. We must not spare any efforts to  find other means than those already adopted to inspire the working class  with healthy and patriotic ambitions.    It is to be hoped, in any case, that if ever a great and common duty,  requiring the concentration of the whole national strength, is imposed  upon us, that the labour classes will not withhold their co-operation,  and that, in face of a common danger, our nation will recover that unity  which is lamentably deficient to-day.    No attempt at settlement has been made in the religious domain. The old  antagonists are still bitterly hostile to each other, especially in  Germany. It will be the duty of the future to mitigate the religious and  political antagonism of the denominations, under guarantees of absolute  liberty of thought and all personal convictions, and to combine the  conflicting views into a harmonious and higher system. At present there  appears small probability of attaining this end. The dogmatism of  Protestant orthodoxy and the Jesuitic tendencies and ultramontanism of  the Catholics, must be surmounted, before any common religious movement  can be contemplated. But no German statesman can disregard this aspect  of affairs, nor must he ever forget that the greatness of our nation is  rooted exclusively on Protestantism. Legally and socially all  denominations enjoy equal rights, but the German State must never  renounce the leadership in the domain of free spiritual development. To  do so would mean loss of prestige.    Duties of the greatest importance for the whole advance of human  civilization have thus been transmitted to the German nation, as heir of  a great and glorious past. It is faced with problems of no less  significance in the sphere of its international relations. These  problems are of special importance, since they affect most deeply the  intellectual development, and on their solution depends the position of  Germany in the world.    The German Empire has suffered great losses of territory in the storms  and struggles of the past. The Germany of to-day, considered  geographically, is a mutilated torso of the old dominions of the  Emperors; it comprises only a fraction of the German peoples. A large  number of German fellow-countrymen have been incorporated into other  States, or live in political independence, like the Dutch, who have  developed into a separate nationality, but in language and national  customs cannot deny their German ancestry. Germany has been robbed of  her natural boundaries; even the source and mouth of the most  characteristically German stream, the much lauded German Rhine, lie  outside the German territory. On the eastern frontier, too, where the  strength of the modern German Empire grew up in centuries of war against  the Slavs, the possessions of Germany are menaced. The Slavonic waves  are ever dashing more furiously against the coast of that Germanism,  which seems to have lost its old victorious strength.    Signs of political weakness are visible here, while for centuries the  overflow of the strength of the German nation has poured into foreign  countries, and been lost to our fatherland and to our nationality; it is  absorbed by foreign nations and steeped with foreign sentiments. Even  to-day the German Empire possesses no colonial territories where its  increasing population may find remunerative work and a German way of  living.    This is obviously not a condition which can satisfy a powerful nation,  or corresponds to the greatness of the German nation and its  intellectual importance.    At an earlier epoch, to be sure, when Germans had in the course of  centuries grown accustomed to the degradation of being robbed of all  political significance, a large section of our people did not feel this  insufficiency. Even during the age of our classical literature the  patriotic pride of that idealistic generation \"was contented with the  thought that no other people could follow the bold flights of German  genius or soar aloft to the freedom of our world citizenship.\" [B]    [Footnote B: Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte,\" i., p. 195.]    Schiller, in 1797, could write the lines:      \"German majesty and honour    Fall not with the princes' crown;    When amid the flames of war    German Empire crashes down,    German greatness stands unscathed.\" [C]    [Footnote C: Fragment of a poem on \"German Greatness,\" published in 1905  by Bernhard Suphan.]    The nobler and better section of our nation, at any rate, holds  different sentiments to-day. We attach a higher value to the influence  of the German spirit on universal culture than was then possible, since  we must now take into consideration the immense development of Germany  in the nineteenth century, and can thus better estimate the old  importance of our classical literature. Again, we have learnt from the  vicissitudes of our historical growth to recognize that the full and due  measure of intellectual development can only be achieved by the political  federation of our nation. The dominion of German thought can  only be extended under the aegis of political power, and unless we act  in conformity to this idea, we shall be untrue to our great duties  towards the human race.    Our first and positive duty consists, therefore, in zealously guarding  the territories of Germany, as they now are, and in not surrendering a  foot's breadth of German soil to foreign nationalities. On the west the  ambitious schemes of the Latin race have been checked, and it is hard to  imagine that we shall ever allow this prize of victory to be snatched  again from our hands. On the south-east the Turks, who formerly  threatened the civilized countries of Europe, have been completely  repulsed. They now take a very different position in European politics  from that which they filled at the time of their victorious advance  westwards. Their power on the Mediterranean is entirely destroyed. On  the other hand, the Slavs have become a formidable power. Vast regions  which were once under German influence are now once more subject to  Slavonic rule, and seem permanently lost to us. The present Russian  Baltic provinces were formerly flourishing seats of German culture. The  German element in Austria, our ally, is gravely menaced by the Slavs;  Germany herself is exposed to a perpetual peaceful invasion of Slavonic  workmen. Many Poles are firmly established in the heart of Westphalia.  Only faint-hearted measures are taken to-day to stem this Slavonic  flood. And yet to check this onrush of Slavism is not merely an  obligation inherited from our fathers, but a duty in the interests of  self-preservation and European civilization."]]]
