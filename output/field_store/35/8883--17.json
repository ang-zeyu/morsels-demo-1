These men certainly held important  lordships in the districts named, but whether so many earldoms, in form  and law, had really been established by the Conqueror at this date, or  were established by him at any later time, is exceedingly doubtful. The  evidence of the chroniclers is easily shown to be untrustworthy in the  matter of titles, and the more satisfactory evidence which we obtain from  charters and the Domesday Book does not justify this extensive list.  But the historian does not find it possible to decide with confidence in  every individual case. Of the earldoms of this list it is nearly certain  that we must drop out those of Cornwall, Holderness, Surrey, Berkshire,  and Richmond, and almost or quite certain that we may allow to stand  those of Waltheof and William Fitz Osbern, of Kent, Chester, and  Shrewsbury.    Independently of the question of evidence, it is difficult to see what  there was in the general situation in England which could have led the  Conqueror to so wide a departure from the established practice of the  Norman dukes as the creation of so many earls would be. In Normandy the  title of count was practically unknown outside the ducal family. The  feudal count as found in other French provinces, the sovereign of a  little principality as independent of the feudal holder of the province  as he himself was of the king, did not exist there. The four lordships  which bore the title of count, Talou or Arques, Eu, Evreux, and Mortain,  were reserved for younger branches of the ducal house, and carried with  them no sovereign rights. The tradition of the Saxon earldom undoubtedly  exercised by degrees a great influence on the royal practice in England,  and by the middle of the twelfth century earls existed in considerable  numbers; but the lack of conclusive evidence for the existence of many  under William probably reflects the fact of his few creations. But in the  cases which we can certainly trace to William, it was not the old Saxon  earldom which was revived. The new earldom, with the possible exception  of one or two earls who, like the old Prankish margrave, or the later  palatine count, were given unusual powers to support unusual military  responsibilities, was a title, not an office. It was not a government of  provinces, but a mark of rank; and the danger involved in the older  office, of the growth of independent powers within the state under local  dynasties which would be, though existing under other forms, as difficult  to control as the local dynasties of feudal France, was removed once for  all by the introduction of the Norman centralization. That no serious  trouble ever came from the so-called palatine earldoms is itself evidence  of the powerful monarchy ruling in England.    This centralization was one of the great facts of the Conquest. In it  resided the strength of the Norman monarchy, and it was of the utmost  importance as well in its bearing on the future history of England.  Delolme, one of the earliest of foreign writers on the English  constitution, remarks that the explanation of English liberty is to be  found in the absolute power of her early kings, and the most careful  modern student can do no more than amplify this statement. That this  centralization was the result of any deliberate policy on the part of  William can hardly be maintained. A conscious modification of the feudal  system as he introduced it into England, with a view to the preservation  of his own power, has often been attributed to the Conqueror. But the  political insight which would have enabled him to recognize the evil  tendencies inherent in the only institutional system he had ever known,  and to plan and apply remedies proper to counteract these tendencies but  not inconsistent with the system itself, would indicate a higher quality  of statesmanship than anything else in his career shows him to possess.  More to the purpose is the fact that there is no evidence of any such  modification, while the drift of evidence is against it. William was  determined to be strong, not because of any theory which he had formed of  the value of strength, or of the way to secure it, but because he was  strong and had always been so since he recovered the full powers of a  sovereign in the struggles which followed his minority. The concentration  of all the functions of sovereignty in his own hands, and the reservation  of the allegiance of all landholders to himself, which strengthened his  position in England, had strengthened it first in Normandy.    Intentional weakening of the feudal barons has been seen in the fact that  the manors which they held were scattered about in different parts of  England, so that the formation of an independent principality, or a quick  concentration of strength, would not be possible. That this was a fact  characteristic of England is probably true. But it is sufficiently  accounted for in part by the gradual spread of the Norman occupation, and  of the consequent confiscations and re-grants, and in part by the fact  that it had always been characteristic of England, so that when the  holding of a given Saxon thane was transferred bodily to the Norman  baron, he found his manors lying in no continuous whole. In any case,  however, the divided character of the Norman baronies in England must not  be pressed too far. The grants to his two half brothers, and the earldoms  of Chester and Shrewsbury on the borders of Wales, are enough to show  that William was not afraid of principalities within the state, and other  instances on a somewhat smaller scale could be cited. Nor ought  comparison to be made between English baronies, or earldoms even, and  those feudal dominions on the continent which had been based on the  counties of the earlier period. In these, sovereign rights over a large  contiguous territory, originally delegated to an administrative officer,  had been transformed into a practically independent power. The proper  comparison is rather between the English baronies of whatever rank and  those continental feudal dominions which were formed by natural process  half economic and half political, without definite delegation of  sovereign powers, within or alongside the provincial countships, and this  comparison would show less difference.    If the Saxon earl did not survive the Conquest in the same position as  before, the Saxon sheriff did. The office as the Normans found it in  England was in so many ways similar to that of the viscount, vicecomes,  which still survived in Normandy as an administrative office, that it was  very easy to identify the two and to bring the Norman name into common  use as an equivalent of the Saxon. The result of the new conditions was  largely to increase the sheriff's importance and power. As the special  representative of the king in the county, he shared in the increased  power of his master, practically the whole administrative system of the  state, as it affected its local divisions, was worked through him.  Administrator of the royal domains, responsible for the most important  revenues, vehicle of royal commands of all kinds, and retaining the  judicial functions which had been associated with the office in Saxon  times, he held a position, not merely of power but of opportunity.  Evidence is abundant of great abuse of power by the sheriff at the  expense of the conquered. Nor did the king always escape these abuses,  for the office, like that of the Carolingian count, to which it was in  many ways similar, contained a possibility of use for private and  personal advantage which could be corrected, even by so strong a  sovereign as the Anglo-Norman, only by violent intervention at intervals.    Some time after the Conquest, but at a date unknown, William set aside a  considerable portion of Hampshire to form a hunting ground, the New  Forest, near his residence at Winchester. The chroniclers of the next  generation describe the formation of the Forest as the devastation of a  large tract of country in which churches were destroyed, the inhabitants  driven out, and the cultivated land thrown back into wilderness, and they  record a contemporary belief that the violent deaths of so many members  of William's house within the bounds of the Forest, including two of his  sons, were acts of divine vengeance and proofs of the wickedness of the  deed. While this tradition of the method of making the Forest is still  generally accepted, it has been called in question for reasons that make  it necessary, in my opinion, to pronounce it doubtful. It is hardly  consistent with the general character of William. Such statements of  chroniclers are too easily explained to warrant us in accepting them  without qualification. The evidence of geology and of the history of  agriculture indicates that probably the larger part of this tract was  only thinly populated, and Domesday Book shows some portions of the  Forest still occupied by cultivators.[9] The forest laws of the Norman  kings were severe in the extreme, and weighed cruelly on beasts and men  alike, and on men of rank as well as simple freemen. They excited a  general and bitter hostility which lasted for generations, and prepared a  natural soil for the rapid growth of a partially mythical explanation to  account in a satisfactory way for the dramatic accidents which followed  the family of the Conqueror in the Forest, by the direct and tangible  wickedness which had attended the making of the hunting ground. It is  probable also that individual acts of violence did accompany the making,  and that some villages and churches were destroyed. But the likelihood is  so strong against a general devastation that history should probably  acquit William of the greater crime laid to his charge, and refuse to  place any longer the devastation of Hampshire in the same class with that  of Northumberland.

He remained  therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;  but he finally came out safe and sound.    One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that  man can breathe in the midst of flames. This marvelous property cannot  be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage  through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great  resistance of our organs to the action of heat. The following, moreover,  are direct proofs of such resistance. In England, in their first  experiment, Messrs. Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr. Solander  remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.  Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat. On  breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several  degrees. Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,  produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the  same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.  When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of  a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience  a sensation like that of a burn. A thermometer placed under the tongue  of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg. Fahr., which is the normal  temperature of the human species.    Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which  the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg. Fahr. He remained therein  eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the  coolest part, which was at 240 deg. Fahr. During all this time he  experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he  felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to  leave the place. His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the  minute, that is to say, double what it usually did. To ascertain whether  there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find  out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot  air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in  the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty  minutes they were baked hard.    A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in  England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate  was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes. In the immediate  vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg. Persons not of  the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in  the eyes, nose, and ears.    A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a  furnace at 132 deg. C.    The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be  attributed to several causes. First, it has been found that the quantity  of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical  phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,  diminish in measure as the external temperature rises. Hence, a conflict  which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living  being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the  surrounding medium. On another hand, it has been observed that man  resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated  with vapors. Dr. Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature  varying from 109 deg. to 110 deg. C. in dry air, could remain only twelve  minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg. to 51.75 deg. At the  Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr. E.  Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes. This  physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg. at  Pekin, 14,000 persons perished. These facts are explained by the cooling  that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the  body. Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater  in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air. The observations become  still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a  solid which suppresses perspiration. Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges  water of 37 deg. for half an hour; but at 45 deg. he could not remain in it more  than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six  minutes. According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near  a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg. C. to them, can hardly  bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg. and mercury at 48 deg.    The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear  one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished  to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries. In a vast vaulted chamber  nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of  posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,  and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods. When this was set  on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the  chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through  pipes made for the purpose. Then the door was suddenly opened before the  neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor  was composed of an incandescent grating.    The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance  \"Sethos,\" printed at the end of last century. Unfortunately literary  frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of  an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources. I have sought  in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,  but I have not been able to find them. I suppose, however, that  this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the  imagination. The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the  grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero  was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose  it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care  to place his feet. But this explanation is inadmissible. He who had the  courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly  would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.  Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no  other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as  soon as possible. We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense  grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a  temperature. It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the  two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had  also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini  experiments. It is even probable that this grating was of copper,  which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying  brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from  the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.      The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to  a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a  solid substance was felt. The early settler contented himself with the  log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone  enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the  surface of the earth. Even after the desirability of more handsome and  durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities  than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded  in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by  the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World. Thus we find the  colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list  of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are  described as being \"fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and  stone,\" were thus provided only with foreign products. Isolated  instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last  century; but they are rare. The edifice known as \"King's Chapel,\"  Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from  American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.    Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also  found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country. The first granite  quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,  and work began at that point early in the present century. The fame of  the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to  New Orleans. The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as  a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in  New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of  Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic  coast. In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole  blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material. It was from  the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;  this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset  River, built in 1827.    Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent  granite. After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island  acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic  therein. Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this  valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been  wrought for monumental purposes. Statues and other elaborate monumental  designs are now extensively made therefrom. Smaller pieces and a coarser  quality of the stone are here and"]]]
