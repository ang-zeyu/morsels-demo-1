Eric walked into the parlour and sat down as bidden. He found himself  in the most old-fashioned room he had ever seen. The solidly made chairs  and tables, of some wood grown dark and polished with age, made even  Mrs. Williamson's \"parlour set\" of horsehair seem extravagantly modern  by contrast. The painted floor was covered with round braided rugs.  On the centre table was a lamp, a Bible and some theological volumes  contemporary with the square-runged furniture. The walls,  wainscoted half way up in wood and covered for the rest with a dark,  diamond-patterned paper, were hung with faded engravings, mostly of  clerical-looking, bewigged personages in gowns and bands.    But over the high, undecorated black mantel-piece, in a ruddy glow of  sunset light striking through the window, hung one which caught and  held Eric's attention to the exclusion of everything else. It was the  enlarged \"crayon\" photograph of a young girl, and, in spite of the  crudity of execution, it was easily the center of interest in the room.    Eric at once guessed that this must be the picture of Margaret Gordon,  for, although quite unlike Kilmeny's sensitive, spirited face in  general, there was a subtle, unmistakable resemblance about brow and  chin.    The pictured face was a very handsome one, suggestive of velvety dark  eyes and vivid colouring; but it was its expression rather than its  beauty which fascinated Eric. Never had he seen a countenance indicative  of more intense and stubborn will power. Margaret Gordon was dead  and buried; the picture was a cheap and inartistic production in an  impossible frame of gilt and plush; yet the vitality in that face  dominated its surroundings still. What then must have been the power of  such a personality in life?    Eric realized that this woman could and would have done whatsoever she  willed, unflinchingly and unrelentingly. She could stamp her desire on  everything and everybody about her, moulding them to her wish and will,  in their own despite and in defiance of all the resistance they might  make. Many things in Kilmeny's upbringing and temperament became clear  to him.    \"If that woman had told me I was ugly I should have believed her,\" he  thought. \"Ay, even though I had a mirror to contradict her. I should  never have dreamed of disputing or questioning anything she might have  said. The strange power in her face is almost uncanny, peering out as it  does from a mask of beauty and youthful curves. Pride and stubbornness  are its salient characteristics. Well, Kilmeny does not at all resemble  her mother in expression and only very slightly in feature.\"    His reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Thomas and Janet  Gordon. The former had evidently been called from his work. He nodded  without speaking, and the two sat gravely down before Eric.    \"I have come to see you with regard to your niece, Mr. Gordon,\" he said  abruptly, realizing that there would be small use in beating about the  bush with this grim pair. \"I met your--I met Neil Gordon in the Connors  orchard, and I found that he has told you that I have been meeting  Kilmeny there.\"    He paused. Thomas Gordon nodded again; but he did not speak, and he  did not remove his steady, piercing eyes from the young man's flushed  countenance. Janet still sat in a sort of expectant immovability.    \"I fear that you have formed an unfavourable opinion of me on this  account, Mr. Gordon,\" Eric went on. \"But I hardly think I deserve it.  I can explain the matter if you will allow me. I met your niece  accidentally in the orchard three weeks ago and heard her play. I  thought her music very wonderful and I fell into the habit of coming to  the orchard in the evenings to hear it. I had no thought of harming her  in any way, Mr. Gordon. I thought of her as a mere child, and a child  who was doubly sacred because of her affliction. But recently I--I--it  occurred to me that I was not behaving quite honourably in encouraging  her to meet me thus. Yesterday evening I asked her to bring me here and  introduce me to you and her aunt. We would have come then if you had  been at home. As you were not we arranged to come tonight.\"    \"I hope you will not refuse me the privilege of seeing your niece, Mr.  Gordon,\" said Eric eagerly. \"I ask you to allow me to visit her here.  But I do not ask you to receive me as a friend on my own recommendations  only. I will give you references--men of standing in Charlottetown and  Queenslea. If you refer to them--\"    \"I don't need to do that,\" said Thomas Gordon, quietly. \"I know more of  you than you think, Master. I know your father well by reputation and  I have seen him. I know you are a rich man's son, whatever your whim in  teaching a country school may be. Since you have kept your own counsel  about your affairs I supposed you didn't want your true position  generally known, and so I have held my tongue about you. I know no  ill of you, Master, and I think none, now that I believe you were not  beguiling Kilmeny to meet you unknown to her friends of set purpose. But  all this doesn't make you a suitable friend for her, sir--it makes you  all the more unsuitable. The less she sees of you the better.\"    Eric almost started to his feet in an indignant protest; but he swiftly  remembered that his only hope of winning Kilmeny lay in bringing Thomas  Gordon to another way of thinking. He had got on better than he had  expected so far; he must not now jeopardize what he had gained by  rashness or impatience.    \"Why do you think so, Mr. Gordon?\" he asked, regaining his self-control  with an effort.    \"Well, plain speaking is best, Master. If you were to come here and  see Kilmeny often she'd most likely come to think too much of you. I  mistrust there's some mischief done in that direction already. Then when  you went away she might break her heart--for she is one of those who  feel things deeply. She has been happy enough. I know folks condemn us  for the way she has been brought up, but they don't know everything. It  was the best way for her, all things considered. And we don't want her  made unhappy, Master.\"    \"But I love your niece and I want to marry her if I can win her love,\"  said Eric steadily.    He surprised them out of their self possession at last. Both started,  and looked at him as if they could not believe the evidence of their  ears.    \"Marry her! Marry Kilmeny!\" exclaimed Thomas Gordon incredulously. \"You  can't mean it, sir. Why, she is dumb--Kilmeny is dumb.\"    \"That makes no difference in my love for her, although I deeply regret  it for her own sake,\" answered Eric. \"I can only repeat what I have  already said, Mr. Gordon. I want Kilmeny for my wife.\"    The older man leaned forward and looked at the floor in a troubled  fashion, drawing his bushy eyebrows down and tapping the calloused  tips of his fingers together uneasily. He was evidently puzzled by this  unexpected turn of the conversation, and in grave doubt what to say.    \"What would your father say to all this, Master?\" he queried at last.    \"I have often heard my father say that a man must marry to please  himself,\" said Eric, with a smile. \"If he felt tempted to go back on  that opinion I think the sight of Kilmeny would convert him. But, after  all, it is what I say that matters in this case, isn't it, Mr. Gordon?  I am well educated and not afraid of work. I can make a home for Kilmeny  in a few years even if I have to depend entirely on my own resources.  Only give me the chance to win her--that is all I ask.\"    \"I don't think it would do, Master,\" said Thomas Gordon, shaking his  head. \"Of course, I dare say you--you\"--he tried to say \"love,\" but  Scotch reserve balked stubbornly at the terrible word--\"you think you  like Kilmeny now, but you are only a lad--and lads' fancies change.\"    \"Mine will not,\" Eric broke in vehemently. \"It is not a fancy, Mr.  Gordon. It is the love that comes once in a lifetime and once only. I  may be but a lad, but I know that Kilmeny is the one woman in the world  for me. There can never be any other. Oh, I'm not speaking rashly or  inconsiderately. I have weighed the matter well and looked at it from  every aspect. And it all comes to this--I love Kilmeny and I want what  any decent man who loves a woman truly has the right to have--the chance  to win her love in return.\"    \"Well!\" Thomas Gordon drew a long breath that was almost a sigh.  \"Maybe--if you feel like that, Master--I don't know--there are some  things it isn't right to cross. Perhaps we oughtn't--Janet, woman, what  shall we say to him?\"    Janet Gordon had hitherto spoken no word. She had sat rigidly upright  on one of the old chairs under Margaret Gordon's insistent picture, with  her knotted, toil-worn hands grasping the carved arms tightly, and her  eyes fastened on Eric's face. At first their expression had been guarded  and hostile, but as the conversation proceeded they lost this gradually  and became almost kindly. Now, when her brother appealed to her, she  leaned forward and said eagerly,    \"Do you know that there is a stain on Kilmeny's birth, Master?\"    \"I know that her mother was the innocent victim of a very sad mistake,  Miss Gordon. I admit no real stain where there was no conscious wrong  doing. Though, for that matter, even if there were, it would be no  fault of Kilmeny's and would make no difference to me as far as she is  concerned.\"    A sudden change swept over Janet Gordon's face, quite marvelous in  the transformation it wrought. Her grim mouth softened and a flood of  repressed tenderness glorified her cold gray eyes.    \"Well, then.\" she said almost triumphantly, \"since neither that nor  her dumbness seems to be any drawback in your eyes I don't see why you  should not have the chance you want. Perhaps your world will say she is  not good enough for you, but she is--she is\"--this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#15)"],[1,"e.    He started slightly, and, stretching out his hand, took a spray out of  the epergne.    \"I thought it was lilac,\" he said, quietly. \"I noticed it when I came  in.\"    She took the spray from him and fastened it in his coat, against which  her hands looked white as the driven snow.    \"You shall take it to your own room, Ley,\" she said. \"You shall take  them all.\"    \"Not for worlds, Lil,\" he said. \"This will do.\"    \"And what are they doing?\" she asked.    \"The usual thing,\" he replied; \"playing, singing, rubber at whist, and  boring each other to death generally.\"    She smiled.    \"And what have you been doing?\"    \"Assisting in the latter amusement,\" he answered, lightly.    \"They told me you had gone out,\" she said.    He nodded.    \"Yes, I took the chestnut for a spin.\"    She laughed, a soft, hushed laugh.    \"And left them the first night! That was like you, Ley!\"    \"What was the use of staying? It was wrong, I suppose. I am  unfortunate! Yes, I went for a ride.\"    \"It was a lovely evening. I watched the sunset,\" and she looked at the  window. \"If I had known you were going, I would have looked for you. I  like to see you riding that big chestnut. You went across the meadows?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"across the meadows.\"    He was silent for a minute, then he said, suddenly, \"Lil, I have seen a  vision to-night.\"    \"A vision, Ley!\" she repeated, looking up at him eagerly.    He nodded.    \"A vision. The most beautiful girl I have ever seen, excepting you,  Lil!\"    She made no protest, but smiled.    \"Ley! A girl! What was she like?\"    \"I can't tell you,\" he said. \"I came upon her in a moment. The chestnut  saw her first, and was human enough to be struck motionless. I was  struck too!\"    \"And you can't tell me what she was like?\"    \"No; if I were to describe her with usual phrases you would smile. You  women always do. You can't help being a woman, Lil!\"    \"Was she dark or fair?\"    \"Dark,\" he replied. \"I did not know it at the time; it was impossible  to think whether she was dark or fair while one looked at her, but I  remembered afterward. Lil, you remember that picture I sent you from  Paris--the picture of the girl with the dark eyes and long, silky  hair--not black, but brown in the sunlight, with long lashes shading  the eyes, and the lips curved in a half-serious smile as she looks down  at the dog fawning at her feet?\"    \"I remember, Ley. Was she like that?\"    \"Yes; only alive. Fancy the girl in the picture alive. Fancy yourself  the dog she was smiling at! I was the dog!\"    \"Ley!\"    \"And she spoke as well as smiled. You can imagine the voice that girl  in the picture would have. Soft and musical, but clear as a bell and  full of a subtle kind of witchery, half serious, half mockery. It was  the voice of the girl I met in the lane this evening.\"    \"Ley! Ley, you have come to make poetry to me to-night. I am very  grateful.\"    \"Poetry! It is truth. But you are right; such a face, such a voice  would make a poet of the hardest man that lives.\"    \"And you are not hard, Ley! But the girl! Who is she? What is her name?\"    \"Her name\"--he hesitated a moment, and his voice unconsciously grew  wonderfully musical--\"is Stella--Stella.\"    \"Stella!\" she repeated. \"It is a beautiful name.\"    \"Is it not? Stella!\"    \"And she is--who?\"    \"The niece of old Etheridge, the artist, at the cottage.\"    Lilian's eyes opened wide.    \"Really, Ley, I must see her!\"    His face flushed, and he looked at her.    She caught the eager look, and her own paled suddenly.    \"No,\" she said, gravely. \"I will not see her. Ley--you will forget her  by to-morrow.\"    He smiled.    \"You will forget her by to-morrow. Ley, let me look at you!\"    He turned his face to her, and she looked straight into his eyes, then  she put her arm round his neck.    \"Oh, Ley! has it come at last?\"    \"What do you mean?\" he asked, not angrily, but with a touch of  grimness, as if he were afraid of the answer.    \"Ley,\" she said, \"you must not see her again. Ley, you will go  to-morrow, will you not?\"    \"Why?\" he asked. \"It is not like you to send me away, Lil.\"    \"No, but I do. I who look forward to seeing you as the sweetest thing  in my life--I who would rather have you near me than be--other than I  am--I who lie and wait and listen for your footsteps--I send you, Ley.  Think! You must go, Ley. Go at once, for your own sake and for hers.\"    He rose, and smiled down at her.    \"For my sake, perhaps, but not for hers. You foolish girl, do you think  all your sex is as partial as you are? You did not see her as I saw her  to-night--did not hear her ready wit at my expense. For her sake! You  make me smile, Lil.\"    \"I cannot smile, Ley. You will not stay! What good can come of it? I  know you so well. You will not be content until you have seen your  Venus again, and then--ah, Ley, what can she do but love you, and love  you but to lose you? Ley, all that has gone before has made me smile,  because with them I knew you were heart-whole; I could look into your  eyes and see the light of laughter in their depths; but not this time,  Ley--not this time. You must go. Promise me!\"    His face went pale under her gaze, and the defiant look, which so  rarely shone out in her presence, came into his eyes, and about his  lips.    \"I cannot promise, Lil,\" he said.          CHAPTER V.           For love lay lurking in the clouds and mist,          I heard him singing sweetly on the mountain side:      \"'Tis all in vain you fly, for everywhere am I--          In every quiet valley, on every mountain side!\"    In the clear, bird-like tones of Stella's voice the musical words  floated from the open window of her room above and through the open  French windows of the old man's studio.    With a little start he turned his head away from the easel and looked  toward the door.    Stella had only been in the house three days, but he had already  learned something of her habits, and knew that when he heard the  beautiful voice singing at the window in the early morning, he might  expect to see the owner of the voice enter shortly.    His expectation was not doomed to disappointment. The voice sounded on  the stairs, in the hall, and a moment afterward the door opened and  Stella stood looking smilingly into the room.    If he had thought her beautiful and winsome on that first evening of  her coming, when she was weary with anxiety and traveling, and dressed  in dust-stained clothes, be sure he thought her more beautiful still,  now that the light heart felt free to reveal itself, and the shabby  dress had given place to the white and simple but still graceful  morning gown.    Mrs. Penfold had worked hard during those three days, and with the aid  of the Dulverfield milliner had succeeded in filling a small wardrobe  for \"her young lady,\" as she had learned to call her. The old artist,  ignorant of the power of women in such direction, had watched the  transformation with inward amazement and delight, and was never tired  of hearing about dresses, and hats, jackets, and capes, and was rather  disappointed than otherwise when he found that the grand transformation  had been effected at a very small cost.    Bright and beautiful she stood, like a vision of youth and health in  the doorway, her dark eyes laughingly contemplating the old man's  gentle stare of wonder,--the look which always came into his eyes when  she appeared.    \"Did I disturb you by my piping, uncle?\" she asked as she kissed him.    \"Oh no, my dear,\" he answered, \"I like to hear you,--I like to hear  you.\"    She leant against his shoulder, and looked at his work.    \"How beautiful it is!\" she murmured. \"How quickly it grows. I heard  you come down this morning, and I meant to get up, but I was so  tired--lazy, wasn't I?\"    \"No, no!\" he said, eagerly. \"I am sorry I disturbed you. I came down as  quietly as I could. I knew you would be tired after your dissipation.  You must tell me all about it.\"    \"Yes, come to breakfast and I will tell you.\"    \"Must I?\" he said, glancing at his picture reluctantly.    He had been in the habit of eating his breakfast by installments,  painting while he ate a mouthful and drank his cup of coffee, but  Stella insisted upon his changing what she called a very wicked habit.    \"Yes, of course! See how nice it looks,\" and she drew him gently to the  table and forced him into a chair.    The old man submitted with a sigh that was not altogether one of  regret, and still humming she sat opposite the urn and began to fill  the cups.    \"And did you enjoy yourself?\" he asked, gazing at her dreamily.    \"Oh, very much; they were so kind. Mrs. Hamilton is the dearest old  lady; and the doctor--what makes him smile so much, uncle?\"    \"I don't know. I think doctors generally do.\"    \"Oh, very well. Well, he was very kind too, and so were the Miss  Hamiltons. It was very nice indeed, and they took so much notice of  me--asked me all sorts of questions. Sometimes I scarcely knew what to  answer. I think they thought because I had been brought up in Italy, I  ought to have spoken with a strong accent, and looked utterly different  to themselves. I think they were a little disappointed, uncle.\"    \"Oh,\" he said, \"and who else was there?\"    \"Oh, the clergyman, Mr. Fielding--a very solemn gentleman indeed. He  said he didn't see much of you, and hoped he should see me in church.\"    Mr. Etheridge rubbed his head and looked rather guilty.    \"I expect that was a back-handed knock for me, Stella,\" he said rather  ruefully. \"You see I don't go to church often. I always mean to go, but  I generally forget the time, or I wander into the fields, or up into  the woods, and forget all about the church till it's too late.\"    \"But that's very wicked, abominably so,\" said Stella, gravely, but with  a twinkle in her dark eyes. \"I must look after your morals as well as  your meals, I see, uncle.\"    \"Yes,\" he assented, meekly--\"do, do.\"    \"Well, then there was a"]]]
