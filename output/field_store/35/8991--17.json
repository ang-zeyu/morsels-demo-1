And that mighty tree bent down with the weight of creepers, with those  five illustrious bowmen who had come there for rest sitting under it,  looked like a mountain with (five) huge elephants resting on its side.\"      SECTION XXV    Vaisampayana said, \"Having fallen into distress, those princes thus  obtained at last a pleasant habitation in that forest. And there in  those woods abounding with _Sala_ trees and washed by the Saraswati,  they who were like so many Indras, began to sport themselves. And the  illustrious king, that bull of the Kuru race, set himself to please all  the _Yatis_ and _Munis_ and the principal Brahmanas in that forest, by  offerings of excellent fruits and roots. And their priest, Dhaumya  endued with great energy, like unto a father to those princes, began to  perform the sacrificial rites of _Ishti_ and _Paitreya_ for the Pandavas  residing in that great forest. And there came, as a guest, unto the  abode of the accomplished Pandavas living in the wood after loss of  their kingdom, the old Rishi Markandeya, possessed of intense and  abundant energy. And that bull of the Kuru race, the high-souled  Yudhishthira, possessed of unrivalled strength and prowess, paid his  homage unto that great _Muni_, reverenced by celestials and Rishis of  men, and possessed of the splendour of blazing fire. And that  illustrious and all-knowing _Muni_, of unrivalled energy, beholding  Draupadi and Yudhishthira and Bhima and Arjuna, in the midst of the  ascetics, smiled, recollecting Rama in his mind. And Yudhishthira the  just, apparently grieved at this, asked him, saying, 'All these ascetics  are sorry for seeing me here. Why is it that thou alone smilest, as if  in glee, in the presence of these?' Markandeya replied, 'O child, I too  am sorry and do not smile in glee! Nor doth pride born of joy possess my  heart! Beholding to-day thy calamity, I recollect Rama, the son of  Dasaratha, devoted to truth! Even that Rama, accompanied by Lakshman,  dwelt in the woods at the command of his father. O son of Pritha, I  beheld him in days of old ranging with his bow on the top of the  _Rishyamuka_ hills! The illustrious Rama was like unto Indra, the lord  of Yama himself, and the slayer of Namuchi! Yet that sinless one had to  dwell in the forest at the command of his father, accepting it as his  duty. The illustrious Rama was equal unto Sakra in prowess, and  invincible in battle. And yet he had to range the forest renouncing all  pleasures! Therefore should no one act unrighteously, saying,--_I am  mighty!_ Kings Nabhaga and Bhagiratha and others, having subjugated by  truth this world bounded by the seas, (finally) obtained, O child, all  the region hereafter. Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,  saying,--_I am mighty!_ And, O exalted of men, the virtuous and truthful  king of Kasi and Karusha was called a mad dog for having renounced his  territories and riches! Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,  saying,--_I am mighty!_ O best of men, O son of Pritha, the seven  righteous Rishis, for having observed the ordinance prescribed by the  Creator himself in the Vedas, blaze in the firmament. Therefore, should  no one act unrighteously, saying,--_I am mighty!_ Behold, O king, the  mighty elephants, huge as mountain cliffs and furnished with tusks,  transgress not, O exalted of men, the laws of the Creator! Therefore,  should none act unrighteously saying, _Might is mine!_ And, O foremost  of monarchs, behold all the creatures acting according to their species,  as ordained by the Creator. Therefore, should none act unrighteously,  saying, _Might is mine_. O son of Pritha, in truth, and virtue, and  proper behaviour, and modesty, thou hast surpassed all creatures, and  thy fame and energy are as bright as fire or the Sun! Firm in thy  promises, O illustrious one, having passed in the woods thy painful  exile, thou wilt again, O king, snatch from the Kauravas thy blazing  prosperity with the help of thy own energy!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having spoken these words unto Yudhishthira  (seated) in the midst of the ascetics with friends, the great Rishi  having also saluted Dhaumya and all the Pandavas set out in a northerly  direction!\"      SECTION XXVI    Vaisampayana said, \"While the illustrious son of Pandu continued to  dwell in the _Dwaita_ woods, that great forest became filled with  Brahmanas. And the lake within that forest, ever resounding with Vedic  recitations, became sacred like a second region of Brahma. And the  sounds of the _Yajus_, the _Riks_, the _Samas_, and other words uttered  by the Brahmanas, were exceedingly delightful to hear. And the Vedic  recitations of the Brahmanas mingling with the twang of bows of the sons  of Pritha, produced a union of the Brahmana and Kshatriya customs that  was highly beautiful. And one evening the Rishi Vaka of the _Dalvya_  family addressed Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti seated in the midst of  the Rishis, saying, 'Behold, O chief of the Kurus, O son of Pritha, the  _homa_ time is come of these Brahmanas devoted to ascetic austerities,  the time when the (sacred) fires have all been lit up! These all, of  rigid vows, protected by thee, are performing the rites of religion in  this sacred region! The descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, along with  those of Vasistha and Kasyapa, the illustrious sons of Agastya, the  offspring of Atri all of excellent vows, in fact, all the foremost  Brahmanas of the whole, are now united with thee! Listen, O son of the  Kuru race born of Kunti, thyself with thy brothers, to the words I speak  to thee! As fire aided by the wind consumeth the forest, so _Brahma_  energy mingling with _Kshatriya_ energy, and _Kshatriya_ might mingling  with Brahma power, might, when they gathered force, consume all enemies!  O child, he should never desire to be without Brahmanas who wisheth to  subdue this and the other world for length of days! Indeed, a king  slayeth his enemies having obtained a Brahmana conversant with religion  and worldly affairs and freed from passion and folly. King Vali  cherishing his subjects practised those duties that lead to salvation,  and knew not of any other means in this world than Brahmanas. It was for  this that all the desires of Virochana's son, the Asura (Vali), were  ever gratified, and his wealth was ever inexhaustible. Having obtained  the whole earth through the aid of the Brahmanas, he met with  destruction when he began to practise wrong on them! This earth with her  wealth never adoreth long as her lord a Kshatriya living without a  Brahmana! The earth, however, girt by the sea, boweth unto him who is  ruled by a Brahmana and taught his duties by him! Like an elephant in  battle without his driver, a Kshatriya destitute of Brahmanas decreaseth  in strength! The Brahmana's sight is without compare, and the  Kshatriya's might also is unparalleled. When these combine, the whole  earth itself cheerfully yieldeth to such a combination. As fire becoming  mightier with the wind consumeth straw and wood, so kings with Brahmanas  consume all foes! An intelligent Kshatriya, in order to gain what he  hath not, and increase what he hath, should take counsel of Brahmanas!  Therefore, O son of Kunti, for obtaining what thou hast not and  increasing what thou hast, and spending what thou hast on proper objects  and persons, keep thou with thee a Brahmana of reputation, of a  knowledge of the Vedas, of wisdom and experience! O Yudhishthira, thou  hast ever highly regarded the Brahmanas. It is for this that thy fame is  great and blazeth in the three worlds!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then all those Brahmanas who were with  Yudhishthira worshipped Vaka of the Dalvya race, and having heard him  praise Yudhishthira became highly pleased. And Dwaipayana and Narada and  Jamadagnya and Prithusravas; and Indradyumna and Bhalaki and Kritachetas  and Sahasrapat; and Karnasravas and Munja and Lavanaswa and Kasyapa; and  Harita and Sthulakarana and Agnivesya and Saunaka; and Kritavak and  Suvakana, Vrihadaswa and Vibhavasu; and Urdharetas and Vrishamitra and  Suhotra and Hotravahana; these and many other Brahmanas of rigid vows  then adored Yudhishthira like Rishis adoring Purandara in heaven!\"      SECTION XXVII    Vaisampayana said, \"Exiled to the woods the sons of Pritha with Krishna  seated in the evening, conversed with one another afflicted with sorrow  and grief. And the handsome and well informed Krishna dear unto her  lords and devoted to them, thus spake unto Yudhishthira, 'The sinful,  cruel, and wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra certainly feeleth no  sorrow for us, when, O king, that evil-hearted wretch having sent thee  with myself into the woods dressed in deer-skin feeleth no regret! The  heart of that wretch of evil deeds must surely be made of steel when he  could at that time address thee, his virtuous eldest brother, in words  so harsh! Having brought thee who deservest to enjoy every happiness and  never such woe, into such distress, alas, that wicked-minded and sinful  wretch joyeth with his friends! O Bharata, when dressed in deer-skin  thou hast set out for the woods, only four persons, O monarch, _viz_.,  Duryodhana, Karna, the evil-minded Sakuni, and Dussasana that bad and  fierce brother of Duryodhana, did not shed tears! With the exception of  these, O thou best of the Kurus, all other Kurus filled with sorrow shed  tears from their eyes! Beholding this thy bed and recollecting what thou  hadst before, I grieve, O king, for thee who deservest not woe and hast  been brought up in every luxury! Remembering that seat of ivory in thy  court, decked with jewels and beholding this seat of _kusa_ grass, grief  consumeth me, O king! I saw thee, O king, surrounded in thy court by  kings!

His arrow is tipped with  a piece of the iron and mistaking Krishna's foot for part of a deer, he  shoots his arrow and hits it. Approaching the mark, he sees Krishna's four  arms and is horrified to discover whom he has wounded. As he begs  forgiveness, Krishna grants him liberation and dispatches him to heaven.    Daruka, Krishna's charioteer, now comes in search of his master. Finding  him wounded, he is overwhelmed with grief. Krishna tells him to go to  Dwarka and inform the surviving Yadavas what has happened. On receiving  the news they must leave Dwarka immediately, for the sea will shortly  engulf it. They must also place themselves under Arjuna's protection and  go to Indraprastha. 'Then the illustrious Krishna having united himself  with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible and universal spirit abandoned  his mortal body.'[45]    Daruka goes mournfully to Dwarka where he breaks the news. Vasudeva with  his two wives, Devaki and Rohini, die of grief. Arjuna recovers the bodies  of Krishna and Balarama and places them on a funeral pyre. Rukmini along  with Krishna's seven other queens throw themselves on the flames.  Balarama's wives, as well as King Ugrasena, also die. Arjuna then appoints  Krishna's great grandson, Parikshit, to rule over the survivors and, after  assembling the remaining women and children, removes them from Dwarka and  travels slowly away. As they leave, the ocean comes up, swallowing the  city and engulfing everything except the temple.    [Footnote 40: Plate 19.]    [Footnote 41: Note 13.]    [Footnote 42: Note 14.]    [Footnote 43: Note 7.]    [Footnote 44: Plate 1 and Note 7.]    [Footnote 45: Plate 2 and Note 7.]          (iv) The _Purana_ Re-considered      Such an account gives us what the _Mahabharata_ epic did not give--a  detailed description of Krishna's career. It confirms the epic's view of  Krishna as a hero and fills in many gaps concerning his life at Dwarka,  his relations with the Pandavas, his life as a feudal prince and finally,  his death. It makes clear that throughout the story Krishna is an  incarnation of Vishnu and that his main reason for being born is to aid  the good and kill demons. At the same time, it shows him in two important  new lights--firstly, as one whose youth was spent among cowherds, in  circumstances altogether different from those of a prince and secondly, as  a delightful lover of women, who explores to the full the joys of sexual  love. The second role characterizes him both as cowherd and prince but  with important differences of attitude and behaviour. As a prince, Krishna  is wedded first to Rukmini and then to seven other wives, observing on  each occasion the requisite formalities. Even the sixteen thousand one  hundred girls whom he rescues from imprisonment receive this formal  status. With all of them Krishna enjoys a variety of sexual pleasures and  their love is moral, respectable and approved. Krishna the prince, in  fact, is Krishna the husband. Krishna the cowherd, on the other hand, is  essentially a lover. The cowgirls whose impassioned love he inspires are  all married and in consorting with them he is breaking one of the most  solemn requirements of the moral code. The first relationship has the  secure basis of conjugal duty, the second the daring adventurousness of  romantic passion.    The same abrupt contrast appears between his character as a cowherd and  his character as a prince. As a youth he mixes freely with the cowherds,  behaving with an easy naturalness of manner and obtaining from them an  intense devotion. This devotion is excited by everything he does and  whether as a baby crying for the breast, a little boy pilfering butter or  a young man teasing the married girls, he exerts a magnetic charm. At no  time does he neglect his prime duty of killing demons but this is  subordinated to his innocent delight in living. He is shown as impatient  with old and stereotyped forms of worship, as scorning ordinary morality  and treating love as paramount. Although he acts continually with princely  dignity and is always aware of his true character as Vishnu, his impact on  others is based more on the understanding of their needs than on their  recognition of him as God. When, at times, Krishna the cowherd is adored  as God, he has already been loved as a boy and a young man. In the later  story, this early charm is missing. Krishna is frequently recognized to  be God and is continually revered and respected as a man. His conduct is  invariably resolute but there is a kind of statesmanlike formality about  his actions. He is respectful towards ritual, formal observances and  Brahmans while in comparison with his encounters with the cowgirls his  relations with women have an air of slightly stagnant luxury. His wives  and consorts lavish on him their devotion but the very fact that they are  married removes the romantic element from their relationship.    Such vital differences are only partially resolved in the _Bhagavata  Purana_. Representing as they do two different conceptions of Krishna's  character, it is inevitable that the resulting account should be slightly  biased in one direction or the other. The _Bhagavata Purana_ records both  phases in careful detail blending them into a single organic whole. But  there can be little doubt that its Brahman authors were in the main more  favourably inclined towards the hero prince than towards the cowherd  lover. There is a tendency for the older Krishna to disparage the younger.  Krishna the prince's subsequent meetings with the cowgirls are shown as  very different from his rapturous encounters with them in the forest and  the fact that his later career involves so sharp a separation from them  indicates that the whole episode was somewhat frowned upon. This is  especially evident from the manner in which Krishna addresses the cowgirls  when they meet him during the eclipse of the sun. By this time he has  become an ardent husband constantly satisfying his many wives. He is very  far from having abjured the delights of the flesh. Yet for all his former  loves who long for him so passionately he has only one message. They must  meditate upon him in their minds. No dismissal could be colder, no  treatment more calculatingly callous. And even the accounts of Krishna's  love-making reflects this bias. The physical charms of the cowgirls are  minimized and it is only the beauty of Rukmini which is stressed. It is  clear, in fact, that however much the one tradition involved a break with  morals, the second tradition shrank from countenancing adultery and it was  this latter tradition which commanded the authors' approval. Finally, on  one important issue, the _Purana_ as a whole is in no doubt. Krishna's  true consort is Rukmini. That Krishna's nature should be complemented by a  cowgirl is not so much as even considered. The cowgirls are shown as  risking all for Krishna, as loving him above all else but none is singled  out for mention and none emerges as a rival. In this long account of  Krishna's life what is overwhelmingly significant is that the name of his  supreme cowgirl love is altogether omitted.          V    THE KRISHNA OF POETRY        (i) The Triumph of Radha      During the next two hundred years, from the tenth to the twelfth century,  the Krishna story completely alters. It is not that the facts as given in  the _Bhagavata Purana_ are disputed. It is rather that the emphasis and  view-point are changed. Krishna the prince and his consort Rukmini are  relegated to the background and Krishna the cowherd lover brought sharply  to the fore. Krishna is no longer regarded as having been born solely to  kill a tyrant and rid the world of demons. His chief function now is to  vindicate passion as the symbol of final union with God. We have already  seen that to Indians this final union was the sole purpose of life and  only one experience was at all comparable to it. It was the mutual ecstasy  of impassioned lovers. 'In the embrace of his beloved, a man forgets the  whole world--everything both within and without; in the same way, he who  embraces the Self knows neither within nor without.'[46] The function of  the new Krishna was to defend these two premises--that romantic love was  the most exalted experience in life and secondly, that of all the roads to  salvation, the impassioned adoration of God was the one most valid. God  must be adored. Krishna himself was God and since he had shown divine love  in passionately possessing the cowgirls, he was best adored by recalling  these very encounters. As a result, Krishna's relations with the cowgirls  were now enormously magnified and as part of this fresh appraisal, a  particular married cowgirl, Radha, enters the story as the enchanting  object of his passions. We have seen how on one occasion in the _Bhagavata  Purana_, Krishna disappears taking with him a single girl, how they then  make love together in a forest bower and how when the girl tires and begs  Krishna to carry her, he abruptly leaves her. The girl's name is not  mentioned but enough is said to suggest that she is Krishna's favourite.  This hint is now developed. Radha, for this is the girl's name, is  recognized as the loveliest of all the cowgirls. She is the daughter of  the cowherd Vrishabhanu and his wife, Kamalavati, and is married to Ayana,  a brother of Yasoda. Like other cowgirls, her love for Krishna is  all-consuming and compels her to ignore her family honour and disregard  her husband. Krishna, for his part, regards her as his first love. In  place, therefore, of courtly adventures and battles with demons, Krishna's  adulterous romance is now presented as all in all.[47] It is the moods,  feelings and emotions of a great love-affair which are the essence of the  story and this, in turn, is to serve as a sublime allegory expressing and  affirming the love of God for the soul.
