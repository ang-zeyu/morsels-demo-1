[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#15)"],[1,"a combination is in favour of the story-teller up to a certain  point, it is not favourable to the highest flights, and it is alien to  dramatic presentation pure and simple.  This implies detachment from  moods and characters, high as well as low, that complete justice in  presentation may be done to all alike, and the one balance that obtains  in life grasped and repeated with emphasis.  But towards his leading  characters Stevenson is unconsciously biassed, because they are more or  less shadowy projections of himself, or images through which he would  reveal one or other side or aspect of his own personality.  Attwater is a  confessed failure, because it, more than any other, testifies this: he is  but a mouth-piece for one side or tendency in Stevenson.  If the same  thing is not more decisively felt in some other cases, it is because  Stevenson there showed the better art o' hidin', and not because he was  any more truly detached or dramatic.  \"Of Hamlet most of all,\" wrote  Henley in his sonnet.  The Hamlet in Stevenson--the self-questioning,  egotistic, moralising Hamlet--was, and to the end remained, a something  alien to bold, dramatic, creative freedom.  He is great as an artist, as  a man bent on giving to all that he did the best and most distinguished  form possible, but not great as a free creator of dramatic power.  \"Mother,\" he said as a mere child, \"I've drawed a man.  Now, will I draw  his soul?\"  He was to the end all too fond to essay a picture of the  soul, separate and peculiar.  All the Jekyll and Hyde and even Ballantrae  conceptions came out of that--and what is more, he always mixed his own  soul with the other soul, and could not help doing so.    4. When; therefore, I find Mr Pinero, in lecturing at Edinburgh, deciding  in favour of Stevenson as possessed of rare dramatic power, and wondering  why he did not more effectively employ it, I can't agree with him; and  this because of the presence of a certain atmosphere in the novels, alien  to free play of the individualities presented.  Like Hawthorne's, like  the works of our great symbolists, they are restricted by a sense of some  obtaining conception, some weird metaphysical _weird_ or preconception.  This is the ground \"Ian MacLaren\" has for saying that \"his kinship is not  with Boccaccio and Rabelais, but with Dante and Spenser\"--the ground for  many remarks by critics to the effect that they still crave from him  \"less symbol and more individuality\"--the ground for the Rev. W. J.  Dawson's remark that \"he has a powerful and persistent sense of the  spiritual forces which move behind the painted shows of life; that he  writes not only as a realist but as a prophet, his meanest stage being  set with eternity as a background.\"    Such expressions are fullest justification for what we have here said: it  adds, and can only add, to our admiration of Stevenson, as a thinker,  seer, or mystic, but the asserting sense of such power can only end in  lessening the height to which he could attain as a dramatic artist; and  there is much indeed against Mr Pinero's own view that, in the dramas, he  finds that \"fine speeches\" are ruinous to them as acting plays.  In the  strict sense overfine speeches are yet almost everywhere.  David Balfour  could never have writ some speeches attributed to him--they are just R.  L. Stevenson with a very superficial difference that, when once detected,  renders them curious and quaint and interesting, but not dramatic.          CHAPTER XIII--PREACHER AND MYSTIC FABULIST      In reality, Stevenson is always directly or indirectly preaching a  sermon--enforcing a moral--as though he could not help it.  \"He would  rise from the dead to preach a sermon.\"  He wrote some first-rate fables,  and might indeed have figured to effect as a moralist-fabulist, as truly  he was from beginning to end.  There was a bit of Bunyan in him as well  as of AEsop and Rousseau and Thoreau--the mixture that found coherency in  his most peculiarly patient and forbearing temper is what gives at once  the quaintness, the freedom, and yet the odd didactic something that is  never wanting.  I remember a fable about the Devil that might well be  brought in to illustrate this here--careful readers who neglect nothing  that Stevenson wrote will remember it also and perhaps bear me out here.    But for the sake of the young folks who may yet have some leeway to make  up, I shall indulge myself a little by quoting it: and, since I am on  that tack, follow it by another which presents Stevenson in his favourite  guise of quizzing his own characters, if not for his own advantage  certainly for ours, if we would in the least understand the fine moralist-  casuistical qualities of his mind and fancy:       THE DEVIL AND THE INNKEEPER       Once upon a time the devil stayed at an inn, where no one knew him,     for they were people whose education had been neglected.  He was bent     on mischief, and for a time kept everybody by the ears.  But at last     the innkeeper set a watch upon the devil and took him in the act.       The innkeeper got a rope's end.       \"Now I am going to thrash you,\" said the inn-keeper.       \"You have no right to be angry with me,\" said the devil.  \"I am only     the devil, and it is my nature to do wrong.\"       \"Is that so?\" asked the innkeeper.       \"Fact, I assure you,\" said the devil.       \"You really cannot help doing ill?\" asked the innkeeper.       \"Not in the smallest,\" said the devil, \"it would be useless cruelty to     thrash a thing like me.\"       \"It would indeed,\" said the innkeeper.       And he made a noose and hanged the devil.       \"There!\" said the innkeeper.    The deeper Stevenson goes, the more happily is he inspired.  We could  scarcely cite anything more Stevensonian, alike in its humour and its  philosophy, than the dialogue between Captain Smollett and Long John  Silver, entitled _The Persons of the Tale_.  After chapter xxxii. of  _Treasure Island_, these two puppets \"strolled out to have a pipe before  business should begin again, and met in an open space not far from the  story.\"  After a few preliminaries:       \"You're a damned rogue, my man,\" said the Captain.       \"Come, come, Cap'n, be just,\" returned the other.  \"There's no call to     be angry with me in earnest.  I'm on'y a character in a sea story.  I     don't really exist.\"       \"Well, I don't really exist either,\" says the Captain, \"which seems to     meet that.\"       \"I wouldn't set no limits to what a virtuous character might consider     argument,\" responded Silver.  \"But I'm the villain of the tale, I am;     and speaking as one seafaring man to another, what I want to know is,     what's the odds?\"       \"Were you never taught your catechism?\" said the Captain.  \"Don't you     know there's such a thing as an Author?\"       \"Such a thing as a Author?\" returned John, derisively.  \"And who     better'n me?  And the p'int is, if the Author made you, he made Long     John, and he made Hands, and Pew, and George Merry--not that George is     up to much, for he's little more'n a name; and he made Flint, what     there is of him; and he made this here mutiny, you keep such a work     about; and he had Tom Redruth shot; and--well, if that's a Author,     give me Pew!\"       \"Don't you believe in a future state?\" said Smollett.  \"Do you think     there's nothing but the present sorty-paper?\"       \" I don't rightly know for that,\" said Silver, \"and I don't see what     it's got to do with it, anyway.  What I know is this: if there is sich     a thing as a Author, I'm his favourite chara'ter.  He does me fathoms     better'n he does you--fathoms, he does.  And he likes doing me.  He     keeps me on deck mostly all the time, crutch and all; and he leaves     you measling in the hold, where nobody can't see you, nor wants to,     and you may lay to that!  If there is a Author, by thunder, but he's     on my side, and you may lay to it!\"       \"I see he's giving you a long rope,\" said the Captain. . . .    Stevenson's stories--one and all--are too closely the illustrations by  characters of which his essays furnish the texts.  You shall not read the  one wholly apart from the other without losing something--without losing  much of the quaint, often childish, and always insinuating personality of  the writer.  It is this if fully perceived which would justify one  writer, Mr Zangwill, if I don't forget, in saying, as he did say, that  Stevenson would hold his place by his essays and not by his novels.  Hence  there is a unity in all, but a unity found in a root which is ultimately  inimical to what is strictly free dramatic creation--creation, broad,  natural and unmoral in the highest sense just as nature is, as it is to  us, for example, when we speak of Shakespeare, or even Scott, or of  Cervantes or Fielding.  If Mr Henley in his irruptive if not spiteful  _Pall Mall Magazine_ article had made this clear from the high critical  ground, then some of his derogatory remarks would not have been quite so  personal and offensive as they are.    Stevenson's bohemianism was always restrained and coloured by this.  He  is a casuistic moralist, if not a Shorter Catechist, as Mr Henley put it  in his clever sonnet.  He is constantly asking himself about moral laws  and how they work themselves out in character, especially as these  suggest and involve the casuistries of human nature.  He is often a  little like Nathaniel Hawthorne, but he hardly follows them far enough  and rests on his own preconceptions and predilections, only he does not,  like him, get into or remain long in the cobwebby corners--his love of  the open air and exercise derived from generations of active lighthouse  engineers, out at all times on sea or land, or from Scottish ministers  who were fond of composing their sermons and reflecting on the  backwardness of human nature as they walked in their gardens or along the  hillsides even among mists and storms,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#15)"],[1,"was that of the windmills; but what I have  ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of  La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his  hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all  around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty where  he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far  out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the  portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace  he reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two  young women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to  Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn;  and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imaged  seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,  the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its  four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the  drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of  the sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at  a short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf  would show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give  notice that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they  were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the  stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who  were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or  lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.    At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the  stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is  what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together,  and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the  signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious  satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man  of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were  turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by  their flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty  visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, \"Your  ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to  the order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to  highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.\" The girls were  looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which  the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens,  a thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their  laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \"Modesty becomes  the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness;  this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none  other than to serve you.\"    The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier  only increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his irritation,  and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had  not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,  seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more  than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all  indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but,  in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it  best to speak him fairly, so he said, \"Senor Caballero, if your worship  wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is  plenty of everything else here.\" Don Quixote, observing the respectful  bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed  in his eyes), made answer, \"Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice,  for    'My armour is my only wear,  My only rest the fray.'\"    The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a  \"worthy of Castile,\" though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from  the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks  as a student or a page. \"In that case,\" said he,    \"'Your bed is on the flinty rock,  Your sleep to watch alway;'    and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of  sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single  night.\" So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who  got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his  fast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,  as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The  landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said,  nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to  see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this  time made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They  had taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor  saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had  fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots,  required to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to,  so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and  oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his  armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree  belonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:    \"Oh, never, surely, was there knight    So served by hand of dame,  As served was he, Don Quixote hight,    When from his town he came;  With maidens waiting on himself,    Princesses on his hack--    or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, and Don Quixote  of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring myself  until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the  necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion  has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. A time,  however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then  the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.\"    The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had  nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to  eat. \"I would gladly eat a bit of something,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I  feel it would come very seasonably.\" The day happened to be a Friday, and  in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call  in Castile \"abadejo,\" in Andalusia \"bacallao,\" and in some places  \"curadillo,\" and in others \"troutlet;\" so they asked him if he thought he  could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \"If there be  troutlets enough,\" said Don Quixote, \"they will be the same thing as a  trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small  change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are  like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat.  But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of  arms cannot be borne without support to the inside.\" They laid a table  for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host  brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a  piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable  sight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver  up, he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless  some one else placed it there, and this service one of the ladies  rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would  have been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in  his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore  with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.    While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he  approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby  completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and  that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,  the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan  of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had  been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not  been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully  engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.          CHAPTER III.    WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED  A KNIGHT      Harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse  supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself  into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \"From  this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the  boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the  human race.\" The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a  speech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing  what to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose  until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \"I looked for no  less, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I  have to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has  granted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that  to-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus  tomorrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire,  enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of"]]]
