Nor did  he, in his matchless argument against the gods of Greece and Rome, take  for his attack those deities whose rites were most degrading and  senseless, and which the thinking world despised, but the most lofty  forms of pagan religion, such as were accepted by moralists and  philosophers like Seneca and Plato. And thus he reached the intelligence  of the age, and gave a final blow to all the gods of antiquity.    It would be instructive to show that the religion of Greece, as embraced  by the people, did not prevent or even condemn those social evils that  are the greatest blot on enlightened civilization. It did not  discourage slavery, the direst evil which ever afflicted humanity; it  did not elevate woman to her true position at home or in public; it  ridiculed those passive virtues that are declared and commended in the  Sermon on the Mount; it did not pronounce against the wickedness of war,  or the vanity of military glory; it did not dignify home, or the virtues  of the family circle; it did not declare the folly of riches, or show  that the love of money is a root of all evil. It made sensual pleasure  and outward prosperity the great aims of successful ambition, and hid  with an impenetrable screen from the eyes of men the fatal results of a  worldly life, so that suicide itself came to be viewed as a justifiable  way to avoid evils that are hard to be borne; in short, it was a  religion which, though joyous, was without hope, and with innumerable  deities was without God in the world,--which was no religion at all, but  a fable, a delusion, and a superstition, as Paul argued before the  assembled intellect of the most fastidious and cultivated city of  the world.    And yet we see among those who worshipped the gods of Greece a sense of  dependence on supernatural power; and this dependence stands out, both  in the Iliad and the Odyssey, among the boldest heroes. They seem to be  reverential to the powers above them, however indefinite their views. In  the best ages of Greece the worship of the various deities was sincere  and universal, and was attended with sacrifices to propitiate favor or  avert their displeasure.    It does not appear that these sacrifices were always offered by priests.  Warriors, kings, and heroes themselves sacrificed oxen, sheep, and  goats, and poured out libations to the gods. Homer's heroes were very  strenuous in the exercise of these duties; and they generally traced  their calamities and misfortunes to the neglect of sacrifices, which was  a great offence to the deities, from Zeus down to inferior gods. We  read, too, that the gods were supplicated in fervent prayer. There was  universally felt, in earlier times, a need of divine protection. If the  gods did not confer eternal life, they conferred, it was supposed,  temporal and worldly good. People prayed for the same blessings that the  ancient Jews sought from Jehovah. In this sense the early Greeks were  religious. Irreverence toward the gods was extremely rare. The people,  however, did not pray for divine guidance in the discharge of duty, but  for the blessings which would give them health and prosperity. We seldom  see a proud self-reliance even among the heroes of the Iliad, but great  solicitude to secure aid from the deities they worshipped.           *       *       *       *       *    The religion of the Romans differed in some respects from that of the  Greeks, inasmuch as it was emphatically a state religion. It was more of  a ritual and a ceremony. It included most of the deities of the Greek  Pantheon, but was more comprehensive. It accepted the gods of all the  nations that composed the empire, and placed them in the Pantheon,--even  Mithra, the Persian sun-god, and the Isis and Osiris of the Egyptians,  to whom sacrifices were made by those who worshipped them at home. It  was also a purer mythology, and rejected many of the blasphemous myths  concerning the loves and quarrels of the Grecian deities. It was more  practical and less poetical. Every Roman god had something to do, some  useful office to perform. Several divinities presided over the birth and  nursing of an infant, and they were worshipped for some fancied good,  for the benefits which they were supposed to bestow. There was an  elaborate \"division of labor\" among them. A divinity presided over  bakers, another over ovens,--every vocation and every household  transaction had its presiding deities.    There were more superstitious rites practised by the Romans than by the  Greeks,--such as examining the entrails of beasts and birds for good or  bad omens. Great attention was given to dreams and rites of divination.  The Roman household gods were of great account, since there was a more  defined and general worship of ancestors than among the Greeks. These  were the _Penates_, or familiar household gods, the guardians of the  home, whose fire on the sacred hearth was perpetually burning, and to  whom every meal was esteemed a sacrifice. These included a _Lar_, or  ancestral family divinity, in each house. There were Vestal virgins to  guard the most sacred places. There was a college of pontiffs to  regulate worship and perform the higher ceremonies, which were  complicated and minute. The pontiffs were presided over by one called  Pontifex Maximus,--a title shrewdly assumed by Caesar to gain control of  the popular worship, and still surviving in the title of the Pope of  Rome with his college of cardinals. There were augurs and haruspices to  discover the will of the gods, according to entrails and the flight  of birds.    The festivals were more numerous in Rome than in Greece, and perhaps  were more piously observed. About one day in four was set apart for the  worship of particular gods, celebrated by feasts and games and  sacrifices. The principal feast days were in honor of Janus, the great  god of the Sabines, the god of beginnings, celebrated on the first of  January, to which month he gave his name; also the feasts in honor of  the Penates, of Mars, of Vesta, of Minerva, of Venus, of Ceres, of Juno,  of Jupiter, and of Saturn. The Saturnalia, December 19, in honor of  Saturn, the annual Thanksgiving, lasted seven days, when the rich kept  open house and slaves had their liberty,--the most joyous of the  festivals. The feast of Minerva lasted five days, when offerings were  made by all mechanics, artists, and scholars. The feast of Cybele,  analogous to that of Ceres in Greece and Isis in Egypt, lasted six days.  These various feasts imposed great contributions on the people, and were  managed by the pontiffs with the most minute observances and legalities.    The principal Roman divinities were the Olympic gods under Latin names,  like Jupiter, Juno, Mars, Minerva, Neptune, Vesta, Apollo, Venus, Ceres,  and Diana; but the secondary deities were almost innumerable. Some of  the deities were of Etruscan, some of Sabine, and some of Latin origin;  but most of them were imported from Greece or corresponded with those of  the Greek mythology. Many were manufactured by the pontiffs for  utilitarian purposes, and were mere abstractions, like Hope, Fear,  Concord, Justice, Clemency, etc., to which temples were erected. The  powers of Nature were also worshipped, like the sun, the moon, and  stars. The best side of Roman life was represented in the worship of  Vesta, who presided over the household fire and home, and was associated  with the Lares and Penates. Of these household gods the head of the  family was the officiating minister who offered prayers and sacrifices.  The Vestal virgins received especial honor, and were appointed by the  Pontifex Maximus.    Thus the Romans accounted themselves very religious, and doubtless are  to be so accounted, certainly in the same sense as were the Athenians by  the Apostle Paul, since altars, statues, and temples in honor of gods  were everywhere present to the eye, and rites and ceremonies were most  systematically and mechanically observed according to strict rules laid  down by the pontiffs. They were grave and decorous in their devotions,  and seemed anxious to learn from their augurs and haruspices the will of  the gods; and their funeral ceremonies were held with great pomp and  ceremony. As faith in the gods declined, ceremonies and pomps were  multiplied, and the ice of ritualism accumulated on the banks of piety.  Superstition and unbelief went hand in hand. Worship in the temples was  most imposing when the amours and follies of the gods were most  ridiculed in the theatres; and as the State was rigorous in its  religious observances, hypocrisy became the vice of the most prominent  and influential citizens. What sincerity was there in Julius Caesar when  he discharged the duties of high-priest of the Republic? It was  impossible for an educated Roman who read Plato and Zeno to believe in  Janus and Juno. It was all very well for the people so to believe, he  said, who must be kept in order; but scepticism increased in the higher  classes until the prevailing atheism culminated in the poetry of  Lucretius, who had the boldness to declare that faith in the gods had  been the curse of the human race.    If the Romans were more devoted to mere external and ritualistic  services than the Greeks,--more outwardly religious,--they were also  more hypocritical. If they were not professed freethinkers,--for the  State did not tolerate opposition or ridicule of those things which it  instituted or patronized,--religion had but little practical effect on  their lives. The Romans were more immoral yet more observant of  religious ceremonies than the Greeks, who acted and thought as they  pleased. Intellectual independence was not one of the characteristics of  the Roman citizen. He professed to think as the State prescribed, for  the masters of the world were the slaves of the State in religion as in  war.

So he assembles together the princes and  elders of Israel, recapitulates his laws, enumerates the mercies of the  God to whom he has ever been loyal, and gives his final instructions. He  appoints Joshua as his successor, adds words of encouragement to the  people, whom he so fervently loves, sings his final song, and ascends  the mountain above the plains of Moab, from which he is permitted to  see, but not to enter, the promised land; not pensive and sad like  Godfrey, because he cannot enter Jerusalem, but full of joyous visions  of the future glories of his nation, and breaking out in the language of  exultation, \"Who is like unto thee, O people saved by Jehovah, the  shield of thy help and the sword of thy excellency!\" So Moses, the like  of whom no prophet has since arisen (except that later One whom he  himself foretold), the greatest man in Jewish annals, passes away from  mortal sight, and Jehovah buries him in a valley of the land of Moab,  and no man knoweth his sepulchre until this day.         \"That was the grandest funeral          That ever passed on earth;        But no one heard the trampling,          Or saw the train go forth,--        Perchance the bald old eagle          On gray Bethpeor's height,        Out of his lonely eyrie          Looked on the wondrous sight.\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"And had he not high honor--          The hillside for a pall--        To lie in state, while angels wait          With stars for tapers tall;        And the dark rock-pines, like tossing plumes,          Over his bier to wave,        And God's own hand, in that lonely land,          To lay him in the grave?\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"O lonely grave in Moab's land!          O dark Bethpeor's hill!        Speak to these curious hearts of ours,          And teach them to be still!        God hath his mysteries of grace,          Ways that we cannot tell;        He hides them deep, like the hidden sleep          Of him he loved so well.\"          SAMUEL.      1100 B.C.    THE HEBREW THEOCRACY, UNDER JUDGES.      After Moses, and until David arose, it would be difficult to select any  man who rendered greater services to the Israelitish nation than Samuel.  He does not stand out in history as a man of dazzling intellectual  qualities; but during a long life he efficiently labored to give to the  nation political unity and power, and to reclaim it from idolatries. He  was both a political and moral reformer,--an organizer of new forces, a  man of great executive ability, a judge and a prophet. He made no  mistakes, and committed no crimes. In view of his wisdom and sanctity it  is evident that he would have adorned the office of high-priest; but as  he did not belong to the family of Aaron, this great dignity could not  be conferred on him. His character was reproachless. He was, indeed, one  of the best men that ever lived, universally revered while living, and  equally mourned when he died. He ruled the nation in a great crisis, and  his influence was irresistible, because favored alike by God and man.    Samuel lived in one of the most tumultuous and unsettled periods of  Jewish history, when the nation was in a transition state from anarchy  to law, from political slavery to national independence. When he  appeared, there was no settled government; the surrounding nations were  still unconquered, and had reduced the Israelites to humiliating  dependence. Deliverers had arisen occasionally from the time of  Joshua,--like Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson,--but their victories were  not decisive or permanent. Midianites, Amorites, and Philistines  successively oppressed Israel, from generation to generation; they even  succeeded in taking away their weapons of war. Resistance to this  tyranny was apparently hopeless, and the nation would have sunk into  despair but for occasional providential aid. The sacred ark was for a  time in the hands of enemies, and Shiloh, the religious capital,--abode  of the tabernacle and the ark,--had been burned. Every smith's forge  where a sword or a spear-head could be rudely made was shut up, and the  people were forced to go to the forges of their oppressors to get even  their ploughshares sharpened.    On the death of Joshua (about 1350 B.C.), who had succeeded Moses and  led the Israelites into Canaan, \"nearly the whole of the sea-coast, all  the strongholds in the rich plain of Esdraelon, and, in the heart of  the country, the invincible fortress of Jebus [later site of Jerusalem],  were still in the hands of the unbelievers.\" The conquest therefore was  yet imperfect, like that of the Christianized Saxons in the time of  Alfred over the pagan Danes in England. The times were full of peril and  fear. They developed the military energies of the Israelites, but bred  license, robbery, and crime,--a wild spirit of personal independence  unfavorable to law and order. In those days \"every man did that which  was right in his own eyes.\" It was a period of utter disorder, anarchy,  and lawlessness, like the condition of Germany and Italy in the Middle  Ages. The persons who bore rule permanently were the princes or heads of  the several tribes, the judges, and the high-priest; and in that  primitive state of society these dignitaries rode on asses, and lived in  tents. The virtues of the people were rough, and their habits warlike.  Their great men were fighters. Samson was a sort of Hercules, and  Jephthah an Idomeneus,--a lawless freebooter. The house of Micah was  like a feudal castle; the Benjamite war was like the strife of Highland  clans. Jael was a Hebrew Boadicea; Gideon, at the head of his three  hundred men, might have been a hero of mediaeval romance.    The saddest thing among these social and political evils was a great  decline of religious life. The priesthood was disgraced by the  prevailing vices of the times. The Mosaic rites may have been  technically observed, but the officiating priests were sensual and  worldly, while gross darkness covered the land. The high-priests  exercised but a feeble influence; and even Eli could not, or did not,  restrain the glaring immoralities of his own sons. In those evil days  there were no revelations from Jehovah, and there was no divine vision  among the prophets. Never did a nation have greater need of a deliverer.    It was then that Samuel arose, and he first appears as a pious boy,  consecrated to priestly duties by a remarkable mother. His childhood was  passed in the sacred tent of Shiloh, as an attendant, or servant, of the  aged high-priest, or what would be called by the Catholic Church an  acolyte. He belonged to the great tribe of Ephraim, being the son of  Elkanah, of whom nothing is worthy of notice except that he was a  polygamist. His mother Hannah (or Anna), however, was a Hebrew Saint  Theresa, almost a Nazarite in her asceticism and a prophetess in her  gifts; her song of thanksgiving on the birth of Samuel, for a special  answer to her prayer, is one of the most beautiful remains of Hebrew  poetry. From his infancy Samuel was especially dedicated to the service  of God. He was not a priest, since he did not belong to the priestly  caste; but the Lord was with him, and raised him up to be more than  priest,--even a prophet and a judge. When a mere child, it was he who  declared to Eli the ruin of his house, since he had not restrained the  wickedness and cruelty of his sons. From that time the prophetic  character of Samuel was established, and his influence constantly  increased until he became the foremost man of his nation, second to no  one in power and dignity since the time of Moses.    But there is not much recorded of him until twenty years after the death  of Eli, who lived to be ninety. It was during this period that the  Philistines had carried away the sacred ark from Shiloh, and had overrun  the country and oppressed the Hebrews, who it seems had fallen into  idolatry, worshipping Ashtaroth and other strange gods. It was Samuel,  already recognized as a great prophet and judge, who aroused the nation  from its idolatry and delivered it from the hand of the Philistines at  Mizpeh, where a great battle was fought, so that these terrible foes  were subdued, and came no more into the borders of Israel during the  days of Samuel; and all the cities they had taken, from Ekron unto Gath,  were restored. The subjection of the Philistines was followed by the  undisputed rule of Samuel, under the name of Judge, during his life,  even after the consecration of Saul.    The Israelitish Judge seems to have been a sort of dictator, called to  power by the will of the people in times of great emergency and peril,  as among the Romans. \"The Theocracy,\" says Ewald, \"by pronouncing any  human ruler unnecessary as a permanent element of the State, lapsed into  anarchy and weakness. When a nation is without a government strong  enough to repress lawlessness within and to protect from foes without,  the whole people very soon divides once more into the two ranks of  master and servant. In Deborah's songs all Israel, so far as lay in her  circle of vision, was divided into princes and people. Hence the nation  consisted of innumerable self-constituted and self-sustained kingdoms,  formed whenever some chieftain elevated himself whom individuals or the  body of citizens in a town were willing to serve. Gaal, son of Zobah,  entered Shechem with troops raised by himself, just like a condottiere  in Italy in the Middle Ages. As it became evident that the nation could  not permanently dispense with an earthly government, it was forced to  rally round some powerful leader; and as the Theocracy was still  acknowledged by the best of the nation, these leaders, who owed their  power to circumstances, could not easily be transformed into regular  kings, but to exceptional dictators the State offered"]]]
