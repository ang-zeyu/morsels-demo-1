The light of God's all-comprehending wisdom was  shining upon the Prophet's soul.    The first public meeting of the Church after the day of its  organization was held at the house of Peter Whitmer in Fayette, on  the 11th day of April, 1830. On that occasion Oliver Cowdery, under  Joseph's direction, proclaimed the word of God for the comfort and  instruction of Saints and strangers. The appointment for this meeting  had gone forth through all the neighborhood; and many persons came to  hear what wonderful things were to be spoken by the men who professed  to be called directly of God to the ministry. This was the first public  discourse delivered by an authorized servant of God in these last days.  At the conclusion of the services a number of persons demanded baptism  and membership among the people of God. They professed to have faith  in Christ, avowed their penitence for all evil done by them, and asked  to be baptized that they might obtain the remission of their sins. The  ordinance was administered to such as were worthy.    Following this meeting, which gave him joy and called forth praise  from his heart to Heaven, Joseph journeyed to Colesville, the home of  the kindly Mr. Knight whose bounty had been extended to the Prophet  and to Oliver in an hour of need. Joseph desired to make known to the  family of Knight all that God had spoken in way of command and promise.  Mr. Knight and several members of his family were Universalists. They  were firm in their conviction, but were glad to listen to the message  delivered by Joseph. It was a plain statement; for Joseph made no  attempt to lend earthly adornments to the pure word of Christ. Joseph  Knight listened and then argued with the Prophet. But he was deeply  impressed and solicited Joseph to hold meetings, in which the public  might hear the young Apostle and have opportunity to judge of the  doctrines which he avowed. Newel, a son of Joseph Knight, became much  interested in the Prophet's words. Many serious conversations ensued,  and newel became so far convinced of the divinity of the work that  he gave a partial promise that he would arise in meeting and offer  supplication to God before his friends and neighbors. But at the  appointed moment he failed to respond to Joseph's invitation. Later  he told the Prophet he would pray in secret, and thus seek to resolve  his doubts and gain strength. On the day following, newel went into  the woods to offer his devotions to Heaven; but was unable to give  utterance to his feelings, being held in bondage by some power which  he could not define. He returned to his home ill in body and depressed  in mind. His appearance alarmed his wife, and in a broken voice he  requested her to quickly find the Prophet and bring him to his bedside.  When Joseph arrived at the house, newel was suffering most frightful  distortions of his visage and limbs, as if he were in convulsions. Even  as the Prophet gazed at him Newel was seized upon by some mysterious  influence and tossed helpless about the room. Through the gift of  discernment Joseph saw that his friend was in the grasp of the evil  one, and that only the power of God could save him from the tortures  under which he was suffering. He took Newel's hand and gently addressed  him. Newel replied, \"I am possessed of a devil. Exert your authority, I  beseech you, to cast him out.\" Joseph replied, \"If you know that I have  power to drive him from your soul, it shall be done.\" And when these  words were uttered, Joseph rebuked the Destroyer and commanded him in  the name of Jesus Christ to depart. The Lord condescended to honor His  servant in thus exercising the power which belonged to his Priesthood  and calling, for instantly Newel cried out with joy that he felt the  accursed influence leave him and saw the evil spirit passing from the  room.    Thus was performed the first miracle of the Church. Many people were  present and witnessed it, and when they would have ascribed to Joseph  honor and praise, he checked them, saying:    \"It was not done by man, nor by the power of man, but was done by God  and the power of His godliness; therefore let the honor and the praise  and the dominion and the glory be ascribed to the Father, the Son and  the Holy Spirit for ever and ever.\"    Since that hour thousands of miracles have been performed by the Elders  of the Church, through the power of the Priesthood restored from  Heaven and in fulfillment of the promises made by the Lord Jesus. But  those who have been honored in performing them have not administered  unto their fellowmen to gratify any wish to behold a miracle--a sign  sought for by a wicked and adulterous generation; but to comply with  the command of the Lord in administering an ordinance designed for the  healing of the faithful sick and to comfort them and strengthen them in  their faith.    Newel Knight believed and was made whole. He became enrapt in  contemplation of the goodness of God, and the visions of eternity were  opened to his view. He saw such a world of glory that he lost his sense  of earthly things. His physical being participated in the exaltation,  and while his spirit soared beyond the narrow confines of his earthly  house, his body was caught up and suspended in the air. When the vision  passed he sank, weak but happy, to the floor. So much was he overcome  that it was necessary to carry him to his bed, and leave him to some  hours of repose.    Of the many persons who witnessed these events nearly all subsequently  became members of the Church.    When Joseph had completed a brief ministry among the people in that  region he returned to Fayette, and found that much excitement prevailed  there because of the coming forth of the word of God. \"The Book of  Mormon was accounted as a strange thing;\" and persecution was heaped  upon the adherents of the Church, and all who would entertain friendly  relations with them.    The first appointed conference of the Church of Jesus Christ in  this dispensation was held at Fayette on the 1st day of June, 1830.  Thirty members were present on the opening day; and scores of people  were there who already believed, or came with the desire to hear  the principles taught by Joseph Smith. The sacrament of the Lord's  supper was administered to all the members of the Church in conference  assembled; and the faith of the congregation was so mighty that the  Heavens were opened to their view, and many beheld the glory of the  celestial kingdom. Newel Knight was one of the believers present,  and he saw, through the parted veil of eternity, the Lord Jesus  Christ seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high. Prophetic  vision flooded his soul with light, and he saw the mighty work of the  dispensation carried to its fulfillment; he saw Joseph Smith laboring,  as the instrument of God's choice, to redeem man and lead him back to  the presence of his Creator. The effect of these visions upon Newel  Knight and the others who beheld them, was to deprive them of their  natural strength, and they were carried to couches, upon which they  rested for a brief time. When their strength was restored they arose  and shouted, \"Hosannah, to God and the Lamb,\" and then, to the wonder  and joy of all who heard them, they rehearsed the glories which they  had beheld.    Many baptisms followed. Those of the brethren who were most suitable  were ordained to the ministry, and received instantly the spirit of  their holy calling. Joseph returned to his own home, at Harmony.  Later, accompanied by his wife and three of the Elders, he went  again to Colesville. Here they found many people awaiting baptism.  Joseph prepared to accede to their demand. A suitable portion of a  little stream in that locality was prepared for the purpose of the  administration of the ordinance; but in the night sectarian priests,  fearful of losing their congregations and their hire, instigated evil  men to desecrate the spot and to destroy all the preparations of the  Elders. But the candidates for baptism remained faithful, and were  confirmed in their belief by this sign flowing from the hatred of the  ungodly; and a few days later the ordinance was administered by Oliver  Cowdery to thirteen persons at Colesville. Among them was Emma, the  Prophet's wife, who believed and humbly went forth to perform the  requirement of Heaven. The joy of Joseph when he welcomed his wife into  the Church was unspeakable.    While the baptisms were in progress an angry mob collected, and  threatened destruction to the Elders and believers. The mob surrounded  the houses of Joseph Knight and his son Newel and railed with devilish  hatred at the inmates. The Prophet spoke to them and made an effort to  calm their passion, but without avail. Wearied with their own impotent  wrath, the mobs departed; but only to concoct new plots.    That night a meeting was to be held, and when the believers and  sympathizers had assembled, and Joseph was about to offer them  instruction and consolation, a constable approached and arrested him on  a warrant charging him with being a disorderly person, for setting the  country in an uproar by circulating the Book of Mormon and by preaching  a gospel of revelation. The officer was a kind man, and some time after  the formal arrest he stated to Joseph that the object of the warrant  was to place the prisoner in the hands of the mob who were determined  to destroy him. These words were verified immediately after; because  when the constable was taking Joseph away from Mr. Knight's house in  a wagon, they found the mob in ambush awaiting the appearance of the  Prophet, and ready to act murderously upon a signal from the constable,  whom they vainly believed was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#15)"],[1,"mine own windows torn my household coat,       Razed out my impress, leaving me no sign,       Save men's opinions and my living blood,       To show the world I am a gentleman.              Richard II.      When the boat which carried the worthy captain on board his vessel had  accomplished that task, the sails began to ascend, and the ship was got  under way. She fired three guns as a salute to the house of Ellangowan,  and then shot away rapidly before the wind, which blew off shore, under  all the sail she could crowd.    'Ay, ay,' said the Laird, who had sought Mannering for some time, and now  joined him, 'there they go--there go the free-traders--there go Captain  Dirk Hatteraick and the Yungfrauw Hagenslaapen, half Manks, half  Dutchman, half devil! run out the boltsprit, up mainsail, top and  top-gallant sails, royals, and skyscrapers, and away--follow who can!  That fellow, Mr. Mannering, is the terror of all the excise and  custom-house cruisers; they can make nothing of him; he drubs them, or he  distances them;--and, speaking of excise, I come to bring you to  breakfast; and you shall have some tea, that--'    Mannering by this time was aware that one thought linked strangely on to  another in the concatenation of worthy Mr. Bertram's ideas,    Like orient pearls at random strung;    and therefore, before the current of his associations had drifted farther  from the point he had left, he brought him back by some inquiry about  Dirk Hatteraick.    'O he's a--a--gude sort of blackguard fellow eneugh; naebody cares to  trouble him--smuggler, when his guns are in ballast--privateer, or  pirate, faith, when he gets them mounted. He has done more mischief to  the revenue folk than ony rogue that ever came out of Ramsay.'    'But, my good sir, such being his character, I wonder he has any  protection and encouragement on this coast.'    'Why, Mr. Mannering, people must have brandy and tea, and there's none in  the country but what comes this way; and then there's short accounts, and  maybe a keg or two, or a dozen pounds, left at your stable-door, instead  of a d--d lang account at Christmas from Duncan Robb, the grocer at  Kippletringan, who has aye a sum to make up, and either wants ready money  or a short-dated bill. Now, Hatteraick will take wood, or he'll take  bark, or he'll take barley, or he'll take just what's convenient at the  time. I'll tell you a gude story about that. There was ance a  laird--that's Macfie of Gudgeonford,--he had a great number of kain  hens--that's hens that the tenant pays to the landlord, like a sort of  rent in kind. They aye feed mine very ill; Luckie Finniston sent up three  that were a shame to be seen only last week, and yet she has twelve bows  sowing of victual; indeed her goodman, Duncan Finniston--that's him  that's gone--(we must all die, Mr. Mannering, that's ower true)--and,  speaking of that, let us live in the meanwhile, for here's breakfast on  the table, and the Dominie ready to say the grace.'    The Dominie did accordingly pronounce a benediction, that exceeded in  length any speech which Mannering had yet heard him utter. The tea, which  of course belonged to the noble Captain Hatteraick's trade, was  pronounced excellent. Still Mannering hinted, though with due delicacy,  at the risk of encouraging such desperate characters. 'Were it but in  justice to the revenue, I should have supposed--'    'Ah, the revenue lads'--for Mr. Bertram never embraced a general or  abstract idea, and his notion of the revenue was personified in the  commissioners, surveyors, comptrollers, and riding officers whom he  happened to know--'the revenue lads can look sharp eneugh out for  themselves, no ane needs to help them; and they have a' the soldiers to  assist them besides; and as to justice--you 'll be surprised to hear it,  Mr. Mannering, but I am not a justice of peace!'    Mannering assumed the expected look of surprise, but thought within  himself that the worshipful bench suffered no great deprivation from  wanting the assistance of his good-humoured landlord. Mr. Bertram had now  hit upon one of the few subjects on which he felt sore, and went on with  some energy.    'No, sir, the name of Godfrey Bertram of Ellangowan is not in the last  commission, though there's scarce a carle in the country that has a  plough-gate of land, but what he must ride to quarter-sessions and write  J.P. after his name. I ken fu' weel whom I am obliged to--Sir Thomas  Kittlecourt as good as tell'd me he would sit in my skirts if he had not  my interest at the last election; and because I chose to go with my own  blood and third cousin, the Laird of Balruddery, they keepit me off the  roll of freeholders; and now there comes a new nomination of justices,  and I am left out! And whereas they pretend it was because I let David  Mac-Guffog, the constable, draw the warrants, and manage the business his  ain gate, as if I had been a nose o' wax, it's a main untruth; for I  granted but seven warrants in my life, and the Dominie wrote every one of  them--and if it had not been that unlucky business of Sandy  Mac-Gruthar's, that the constables should have keepit twa or three days  up yonder at the auld castle, just till they could get conveniency to  send him to the county jail--and that cost me eneugh o' siller. But I ken  what Sir Thomas wants very weel--it was just sic and siclike about the  seat in the kirk o' Kilmagirdle--was I not entitled to have the front  gallery facing the minister, rather than Mac-Crosskie of Creochstone, the  son of Deacon Mac-Crosskie, the Dumfries weaver?'    Mannering expressed his acquiescence in the justice of these various  complaints.    'And then, Mr. Mannering, there was the story about the road and the  fauld-dike. I ken Sir Thomas was behind there, and I said plainly to the  clerk to the trustees that I saw the cloven foot, let them take that as  they like. Would any gentleman, or set of gentlemen, go and drive a road  right through the corner of a fauld-dike and take away, as my agent  observed to them, like twa roods of gude moorland pasture? And there was  the story about choosing the collector of the cess--'    'Certainly, sir, it is hard you should meet with any neglect in a country  where, to judge from the extent of their residence, your ancestors must  have made a very important figure.'    'Very true, Mr. Mannering; I am a plain man and do not dwell on these  things, and I must needs say I have little memory for them; but I wish ye  could have heard my father's stories about the auld fights of the  Mac-Dingawaies--that's the Bertrams that now is--wi' the Irish and wi'  the Highlanders that came here in their berlings from Ilay and Cantire;  and how they went to the Holy Land--that is, to Jerusalem and Jericho,  wi' a' their clan at their heels--they had better have gaen to Jamaica,  like Sir Thomas Kittlecourt's uncle--and how they brought hame relics  like those that Catholics have, and a flag that's up yonder in the  garret. If they had been casks of muscavado and puncheons of rum it would  have been better for the estate at this day; but there's little  comparison between the auld keep at Kittlecourt and the castle o'  Ellangowan; I doubt if the keep's forty feet of front. But ye make no  breakfast, Mr. Mannering; ye're no eating your meat; allow me to  recommend some of the kipper. It was John Hay that catcht it, Saturday  was three weeks, down at the stream below Hempseed ford,' etc. etc. etc.    The Laird, whose indignation had for some time kept him pretty steady to  one topic, now launched forth into his usual roving style of  conversation, which gave Mannering ample time to reflect upon the  disadvantages attending the situation which an hour before he had thought  worthy of so much envy. Here was a country gentleman, whose most  estimable quality seemed his perfect good-nature, secretly fretting  himself and murmuring against others for causes which, compared with any  real evil in life, must weigh like dust in the balance. But such is the  equal distribution of Providence. To those who lie out of the road of  great afflictions are assigned petty vexations which answer all the  purpose of disturbing their serenity; and every reader must have observed  that neither natural apathy nor acquired philosophy can render country  gentlemen insensible to the grievances which occur at elections,  quarter-sessions, and meetings of trustees.    Curious to investigate the manners of the country, Mannering took the  advantage of a pause in good Mr. Bertram's string of stories to inquire  what Captain Hatteraick so earnestly wanted with the gipsy woman.    'O, to bless his ship, I suppose. You must know, Mr. Mannering, that  these free-traders, whom the law calls smugglers, having no religion,  make it all up in superstition; and they have as many spells and charms  and nonsense--'    'Vanity and waur!' said the Dominie;' it is a trafficking with the Evil  One. Spells, periapts, and charms are of his device--choice arrows out of  Apollyon's quiver.'    'Hold your peace, Dominie; ye're speaking for ever'--by the way, they  were the first words the poor man had uttered that morning, excepting  that he said grace and returned thanks--'Mr. Mannering cannot get in a  word for ye! And so, Mr. Mannering, talking of astronomy and spells and  these matters, have ye been so kind as to consider what we were speaking  about last night?'    'I begin to think, Mr. Bertram, with your worthy friend here, that I have  been rather jesting with edge-tools; and although neither you nor I, nor  any sensible man, can put faith in the predictions of astrology, yet, as  it has sometimes happened that inquiries into futurity, undertaken in  jest, have in their results produced serious and unpleasant effects both  upon actions and characters, I really wish you would dispense with my  replying to your question.'    It was easy to see that this evasive answer only"]]]
