He might, indeed, be able when once completely cured  to go to sea again, but he would no longer be the active sailor he  had been; able to set an example of energy to his men when the winds  blew high and the ship was in danger. And unless fully conscious  that he was equal to discharging all the duties of his position,  Captain Martin was not the man to continue to hold it.    Ned longed anxiously for the return of the Good Venture. He knew  that his mother's presence would do much for his father, and that  whatever her own sorrows might be she would cheer him. Captain  Martin never expressed any impatience for her coming; but when  each morning he asked Ned, the first thing, which way the wind was  blowing, his son knew well enough what he was thinking of. In the  meantime Ned had been making inquiries, and he arranged for the  hire of a comfortable house, whose inhabitants being Catholics,  had, when Enkhuizen declared for the Prince of Orange, removed  to Amsterdam. For although the Prince insisted most earnestly and  vigorously that religious toleration should be extended to the  Catholics, and that no one should suffer for their religion, all were  not so tolerant; and when the news arrived of wholesale massacres  of Protestants by Alva's troops, the lower class were apt to rise  in riot, and to retaliate by the destruction of the property of  the Catholics in their towns.    Ned had therefore no difficulty in obtaining the use of the house,  on extremely moderate terms, from the agent in whose hands its  owner had placed his affairs in Enkhuizen. The burgomaster's wife  had at his request engaged two female servants, and the nurse  would of course accompany her patient. The burgomaster and his wife  had both protested against any move being made; but Ned, although  thanking them earnestly for their hospitable offer, pointed out that  it might be a long time before his father could be about, that it  was good for his mother to have the occupation of seeing to the  affairs of the house to divert her thoughts from the sick bed, and,  as it was by no means improbable that she would bring his sisters  with her, it would be better in all respects that they should have  a house of their own. The doctors having been consulted, agreed  that it would be better for the wounded man to be among his own  people, and that no harm would come of removing him carefully to  another house.    \"A change, even a slight one, is often a benefit,\" they agreed;  \"and more than counterbalances any slight risk that there may be  in a patient's removal from one place to another, providing that  it be gently and carefully managed.\"    Therefore it was arranged that as soon as the Good Venture was seen  approaching, Captain Martin should be carried to his new abode, where  everything was kept prepared for him, and that his wife should go  direct to him there.        CHAPTER V    NED'S RESOLVE      On the ninth morning after the departure of the brig Ned was up  as soon as daylight appeared, and made his way to the walls. The  watchman there, with whom he had had several talks during the last  two days, said:    \"There is a brig, hull down, seaward, and I should say that she is  about the size of the one you are looking for. She looks, too, as  if she were heading for this port.\"    \"I think that is she,\" Ned said, gazing intently at the distant  vessel. \"It seems to me that I can make out that her jib is lighter  in colour than the rest of her canvas. If that is so I have no  doubt about its being the Good Venture, for we blew our jib away  in a storm off Ostend, and had a new one about four months ago.\"    \"That is her then, young master,\" the watchman said, shading his  eyes and looking intently at the brig. \"Her jib is surely of lighter  colour than the rest of her canvas.\"    With this confirmation Ned at once ran round to the house he had  taken, and told the servants to have fires lighted, and everything  in readiness for the reception of the party.    \"My father,\" he said, \"will be brought here in the course of an  hour or so. My mother will arrive a little later.\"    Ned then went round to the doctor, who had promised that he would  personally superintend the removing of his patient, and would bring  four careful men and a litter for his conveyance. He said that  he would be round at the burgomaster's in half an hour. Ned then  went back to his father. Captain Martin looked round eagerly as he  entered.    \"Yes, father,\" Ned said, answering the look; \"there is a brig in  sight, which is, I am pretty sure, the Good Venture. She will be  in port in the course of a couple of hours. I have just been round  to Doctor Harreng, and he will be here in half an hour with the  litter to take you over to the new house.\"    Captain Martin gave an exclamation of deep thankfulness, and then  lay for some time with his eyes closed, and spoke but little until  the arrival of the doctor and the men with the litter.    \"You must first of all drink this broth that has just been sent up  for you,\" the surgeon said, \"and then take a spoonful of cordial.  It will be a fatigue, you know, however well we manage it; and you  must be looking as bright and well as you can by the time your good  wife arrives, else she will have a very bad opinion of the doctors  of Enkhuizen.\"    Captain Martin did as he was ordered. The men then carefully raised  the mattress with him upon it, and placed it upon the litter.    \"I think we will cover you up altogether,\" the doctor said, \"as we  go along through the streets. The morning air is a good deal keener  than the atmosphere of this room, and you won't want to look about.\"    The litter was therefore completely covered with a blanket, and  was then lifted and taken carefully down the broad staircase and  through the streets. The burgomaster's wife had herself gone on  before to see that everything was comfortably prepared, and when  the bed was laid down on the bedstead and the blanket turned back  Captain Martin saw a bright room with a fire burning on the hearth,  and the burgomaster's wife and nurse beside him, while Ned and the  doctor were at the foot of the bed.    \"You have not suffered, I hope, in the moving, Captain Martin?\"  the burgomaster's wife asked.    \"Not at all,\" he said. \"I felt somewhat faint at first, but the  movement has been so easy that it soon passed off. I was glad my  head was covered, for I do not think that I could have stood the  sight of the passing objects.\"    \"Now you must drink another spoonful of cordial,\" the doctor said,  \"and then lie quiet. I shall not let you see your wife when she  arrives if your pulse is beating too rapidly. So far you have been  going on fairly, and we must not have you thrown back.\"    \"I shall not be excited,\" Captain Martin replied. \"Now that I  know the vessel is in sight I am contented enough; but I have been  fearing lest the brig might fall in with a Spaniard as she came  through the islands, and there would be small mercy for any on board  had she been detected and captured. Now that I know she is coming  to port safely, I can wait quietly enough. Now, Ned, you can be  off down to the port.\"    The doctor went out with Ned and charged him strictly to impress  upon his mother the necessity for self restraint and quiet when  she saw her husband.    \"I am not over satisfied with his state,\" he said, \"and much will  depend on this meeting. If it passes off well and he is none the  worse for it tomorrow, I shall look to see him mend rapidly; but  if, on the other hand, he is agitated and excited, fever may set  in at once, and in that case, weak as he is, his state will be very  serious.\"    \"I understand, sir, and will impress it upon my mother; but I do  not think you need fear for her. Whatever she feels she will, I am  sure, carry out your instructions.\"    Ned went down to the port. He found that the brig was but a quarter  of a mile away. He could make out female figures on board, and knew  that, as he had rather expected would be the case, his mother had  brought his sisters with her. Jumping into a boat he was rowed off  to the vessel, and climbing the side was at once in his mother's  arms. Already he had answered the question that Peters had shouted  before he was halfway from the shore, and had replied that his father  was going on as well as could be expected. Thus when Ned leapt on  board his mother and the girls were in tears at the relief to the  anxiety that had oppressed them during the voyage lest they should  at its end find they had arrived too late.    \"And he is really better?\" were Mrs. Martin's first words as she  released Ned from her embrace.    \"I don't know that he is better, mother, but he is no worse. He  is terribly weak; but the doctor tells me that if no harm comes to  him from his agitation in meeting you, he expects to see him mend  rapidly. He has been rather fretting about your safety, and I think  that the knowledge that you are at hand has already done him good.  His voice was stronger when he spoke just before I started than  it has been for some days. Only, above all things, the doctor says  you must restrain your feelings and be calm and quiet when you first  meet him. And now, girls, how are you both?\" he asked turning to  them. \"Not very well, I suppose; for I know you have always shown  yourselves bad sailors when you have come over with mother.\"    \"The sea has not been very rough,\" Janet said; \"and except when we  first got out to sea we have not been ill.\"    \"What are you going to do about the girls?\" Mrs. Martin asked. \"Of  course I must go where your father is, but I cannot presume upon  the kindness of strangers so far as to quarter the girls upon them.\"    \"That is all arranged, mother. Father agreed with me that it would  not be pleasant for any of you being with strangers, and I have  therefore taken a house; and he has just been moved there, so you  will have him all to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#15)"],[1,"him or else loved him very much, or  you would never have run away.... Dictate to me!\" she broke off,  half-aloud, her mind evidently once more on Mr. Scobell's unfortunate  cable.    Betty could bear it no longer.    \"I loved him!\" she cried. \"I loved him!\"    She was shaking with dry sobs. She felt the old woman's eyes upon her,  but she could not stop.    A sudden whirr cut through the silence. One of the large clocks near  the door was beginning to strike the hour. Instantly the rest began to  do the same, till the room was full of the noise. And above the din  there sounded sharp and clear the note of the little trumpet.    The noise died away with metallic echoings.    \"Honey!\"    It was a changed voice that spoke. Betty looked up, and saw that the  eyes that met hers were very soft. She moved quickly to the old woman's  side.    \"Honey, I'm going to tell you something about myself that nobody dreams  of. Betty, when I was your age, _I_ ran away from a man because I  loved him. It was just a little village tragedy, my dear. I think he  was fond of me, but father was poor and her folks were the great people  of the place, and he married her. And I ran away, like you, and went to  New York.\"    Betty pressed her hand. It was trembling.    \"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered.    \"I went to New York because I wanted to kill my heart. And I killed it.  There's only one way. Work! Work! Work!\" She was sitting bolt upright,  and the soft look had gone out of her eyes. They were hard and fiery  under the drawn brows. \"Work! Ah, I worked! I never rested. For two  years. Two whole years. It fought back at me. It tore me to bits. But I  wouldn't stop. I worked on, I killed it.\"    She stopped, quivering. Betty was cold with a nameless dismay. She felt  as if she were standing in the dark on the brink of an abyss.    The old woman began to speak again.    \"Child, it's the same with you. Your heart's tearing you. Don't let it!  It will get worse and worse if you are afraid of it. Fight it! Kill it!  Work!\"    She stopped again, clenching and unclenching her fingers, as if she  were strangling some living thing. There was silence for a long moment.    \"What can you do?\" she asked suddenly.    Her voice was calm and unemotional again. The abruptness of the  transition from passion to the practical took Betty aback. She could  not speak.    \"There must be something,\" continued Mrs. Oakley. \"When I was your age  I had taught myself bookkeeping, shorthand, and typewriting. What can  you do? Can you use a typewriter?\"    Blessed word!    \"Yes,\" said Betty promptly.    \"Well?\"    \"Not very well?\"    \"H'm. Well, I expect you will do it well enough for Mr. Renshaw--on my  recommendation. I'll give you a letter to him. He is the editor of a  small weekly paper. I don't know how much he will offer you, but take  it and _work!_ You'll find him pleasant. I have met him at charity  organization meetings on the East Side. He's useful at the  entertainments--does conjuring tricks--stupid, but they seem to amuse  people. You'll find him pleasant. There.\"    She had been writing the letter of introduction during the course of  these remarks. At the last word she blotted it, and placed it in an  envelope.    \"That's the address,\" she said. \"J. Brabazon Renshaw, Office of  _Peaceful Moments_. Take it to him now. Good-by.\"    It was as if she were ashamed of her late display of emotion. She spoke  abruptly, and her pale eyes were expressionless. Betty thanked her and  turned to go.    \"Tell me how you get on,\" said Mrs. Oakley.    \"Yes,\" said Betty.    \"And _work_. Keep on working!\"    There was a momentary return of her former manner as she spoke the  words, and Betty wavered. She longed to say something comforting,  something that would show that she understood.    Mrs. Oakley had taken up the feather duster again.    \"Steena will show you out,\" she said curtly. And Betty was aware of the  stolid Swede in the doorway. The interview was plainly at an end.    \"Good-by, Aunt,\" she said, \"and thank you ever so much--for  everything.\"          CHAPTER XII    \"PEACEFUL MOMENTS\"      The man in the street did not appear to know it, but a great crisis was  imminent in New York journalism.    Everything seemed much as usual in the city. The cars ran blithely on  Broadway. Newsboys shouted their mystic slogan, \"Wuxtry!\" with  undiminished vim. Society thronged Fifth Avenue without a furrow on its  brow. At a thousand street corners a thousand policemen preserved their  air of massive superiority to the things of this world. Of all the four  million not one showed the least sign of perturbation.    Nevertheless, the crisis was at hand. Mr. J. Brabazon Renshaw,  Editor-in-chief of _Peaceful Moments_, was about to leave his post  and start on a three-months' vacation.    _Peaceful Moments_, as its name (an inspiration of Mr. Renshaw's  own) was designed to imply, was a journal of the home. It was the sort  of paper which the father of the family is expected to take back with  him from the office and read aloud to the chicks before bedtime under  the shade of the rubber plant.    Circumstances had left the development of the paper almost entirely to  Mr. Renshaw. Its contents were varied. There was a \"Moments in the  Nursery\" page, conducted by Luella Granville Waterman and devoted  mainly to anecdotes of the family canary, by Jane (aged six), and  similar works of the younger set. There was a \"Moments of Meditation\"  page, conducted by the Reverend Edwin T. Philpotts; a \"Moments among  the Masters\" page, consisting of assorted chunks looted from the  literature of the past, when foreheads were bulged and thoughts  profound, by Mr. Renshaw himself; one or two other special pages; a  short story; answers to correspondents on domestic matters; and a  \"Moments of Mirth\" page, conducted by one B. Henderson Asher--a very  painful affair.    The proprietor of this admirable journal was that Napoleon of finance,  Mr. Benjamin Scobell.    That this should have been so is but one proof of the many-sidedness of  that great man.    Mr. Scobell had founded _Peaceful Moments_ at an early stage in  his career, and it was only at very rare intervals nowadays that he  recollected that he still owned it. He had so many irons in the fire  now that he had no time to waste his brain tissues thinking about a  paper like _Peaceful Moments_. It was one of his failures. It  certainly paid its way and brought him a small sum each year, but to  him it was a failure, a bombshell that had fizzled.    He had intended to do big things with _Peaceful Moments_. He had  meant to start a new epoch in the literature of Manhattan.    \"I gottan idea,\" he had said to Miss Scobell. \"All this yellow  journalism--red blood and all that--folks are tired of it. They want  something milder. Wholesome, see what I mean? There's money in it. Guys  make a roll too big to lift by selling soft drinks, don't they? Well,  I'm going to run a soft-drink paper. See?\"    The enterprise had started well. To begin with, he had found the ideal  editor. He had met Mr. Renshaw at a down-East gathering presided over  by Mrs. Oakley, and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J. Brabazon the  seeds of domestic greatness. Before they parted, he had come to terms  with him. Nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition. He made  an admirable editor. It was not Mr. Renshaw's fault that the new paper  had failed to electrify America. It was the public on whom the  responsibility for the failure must be laid. They spoiled the whole  thing. Certain of the faithful subscribed, it is true, and continued to  subscribe, but the great heart of the public remained untouched. The  great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations  of Mr. Philpotts and the humor of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, and continued  to spend its money along the bad old channels. The thing began to bore  Mr. Scobell. He left the conduct of the journal more and more to Mr.  Renshaw, until finally--it was just after the idea for extracting gold  from sea water had struck him--he put the whole business definitely out  of his mind. (His actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear  of the darned thing again, inasmuch as it gave him a pain in the neck.)  Mr. Renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing, and all matters of  finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of Mr.  Scobell's solicitors, who had instructions to sell the journal, if, as  its owner crisply put it, they could find any chump who was enough of a  darned chump to give real money for it. Up to the present the great  army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned  chumphood.    Ever since this parting of the ways, Mr. Renshaw had been in his  element. Under his guidance _Peaceful Moments_ had reached a level  of domesticity which made other so-called domestic journals look like  sporting supplements. But at last the work had told upon him. Whether  it was the effort of digging into the literature of the past every  week, or the strain of reading B. Henderson Asher's \"Moments of Mirth\"  is uncertain. At any rate, his labors had ended in wrecking his health  to such an extent that the doctor had ordered him three months'  complete rest, in the woods or mountains, whichever he preferred; and,  being a farseeing man, who went to the root of things, had absolutely  declined to consent to Mr. Renshaw's suggestion that he keep in touch  with the paper during his vacation. He was adamant. He had seen copies  of _Peaceful Moments_ once or twice, and refused to permit a man  in Mr. Renshaw's state of health to come in contact with Luella  Granville Waterman's \"Moments in the Nursery\" and B. Henderson Asher's  \"Moments of Mirth.\"    \"You must forget that such a paper exists,\" he said. \"You must dismiss  the whole thing from your mind, live in the open, and develop some  flesh and muscle.\"    Mr. Renshaw had bowed before the sentence,"]]]
