The monster beholding them gnawed himself for rage; and  on their persisting to advance, began plunging like a bull when he  is stricken by the knife of the butcher. They succeeded, however, in  entering the fissure before he recovered sufficiently from his madness  to run at them; and at the foot of the descent, came to a river of  boiling blood, on the strand of which ran thousands of Centaurs armed  with bows and arrows. In the blood, more or less deep according to the  amount of the crime, and shrieking as they boiled, were the souls of the  Inflicters of Violence; and if any of them emerged from it higher than  he had a right to do, the Centaurs drove him down with their arrows.  Nessus, the one that bequeathed Hercules the poisoned garment, came  galloping towards the pilgrims, bending his bow, and calling out from  a distance to know who they were; but Virgil, disdaining his hasty  character, would explain himself only to Chiron, the Centaur who  instructed Achilles. Chiron, in consequence, bade Nessus accompany  them along the river; and there they saw tyrants immersed up to the  eyebrows;--Alexander the Great among them, Dionysius of Syracuse, and  Ezzelino the Paduan. There was one of the Pazzi of Florence, and Rinieri  of Corneto (infestors of the public ways), now shedding bloody tears,  and Attila the Scourge, and Pyrrhus king of Epirus. Further on, among  those immersed up to the throat, was Guy de Montfort the Englishman, who  slew his father's slayer, Prince Henry, during divine service, in  the bosom of God; and then by degrees the river became shallower and  shallower till it covered only the feet; and here the Centaur quitted  the pilgrims, and they crossed over into a forest.    The forest was a trackless and dreadful forest--the leaves not green,  but black--the boughs not freely growing, but knotted and twisted--the  fruit no fruit, but thorny poison. The Harpies wailed among the trees,  occasionally showing their human faces; and on every side of him Dante  heard lamenting human voices, but could see no one from whom they came.  \"Pluck one of the boughs,\" said Virgil. Dante did so; and blood and a  cry followed it.    \"Why pluckest thou me?\" said the trunk. \"Men have we been, like thyself;  but thou couldst not use us worse, had we been serpents.\" The blood and  words came out together, as a green bough hisses and spits in the fire.    The voice was that of Piero delle Vigne, the good chancellor of the  Emperor Frederick the Second. Just though he had been to others, he  was thus tormented for having been unjust to himself; for, envy having  wronged him to his sovereign, who sentenced him to lose his eyes, he  dashed his brains out against a wall. Piero entreated Dante to vindicate  his memory. The poet could not speak for pity; so Virgil made the  promise for him, inquiring at the same time in what manner it was that  Suicides became thus identified with trees, and how their souls were to  rejoin their bodies at the day of judgment. Piero said, that the moment  the fierce self-murderer's spirit tore itself from the body, and passed  before Charon, it fell, like a grain of corn, into that wood, and so  grew into a tree. The Harpies then fed on its leaves, causing both pain  and a vent for lamentation. The body it would never again enter, having  thus cast away itself, but it would finally drag the body down to it by  a violent attraction; and every suicide's carcass will be hung upon the  thorn of its wretched shade.    The naked souls of two men, whose profusion had brought them to a  violent end, here came running through the wood from the fangs of black  female mastiff's--leaving that of a suicide to mourn the havoc which  their passage had made of his tree. He begged his countryman to gather  his leaves up, and lay them at the foot of his trunk, and Dante did so;  and then he and Virgil proceeded on their journey.    They issued from the wood on a barren sand, flaming hot, on which  multitudes of naked souls lay down, or sat huddled up, or restlessly  walked about, trying to throw from them incessant flakes of fire, which  came down like a fall of snow. They were the souls of the Impious. Among  them was a great spirit, who lay scornfully submitting himself to the  fiery shower, as though it had not yet ripened him.[22] Overhearing  Dante ask his guide who he was, he answered for himself, and said, \"The  same dead as living. Jove will tire his flames out before they conquer  me.\"    \"Capaneus,\" exclaimed Virgil, \"thy pride is thy punishment. No martyrdom  were sufficient for thee, equal to thine own rage.\" The besieger of  Thebes made no reply.    In another quarter of the fiery shower the pilgrims met a crowd of  Florentines, mostly churchmen, whose offence is not to be named; after  which they beheld Usurers; and then arrived at a huge waterfall, which  fell into the eighth circle, or that of the Fraudulent. Here Virgil, by  way of bait to the monster Geryon, or Fraud, let down over the side  of the waterfall the cord of St. Francis, which Dante wore about his  waist,[23] and presently the dreadful creature came up, and sate on the  margin of the fall, with his serpent's tail hanging behind him in  the air, after the manner of a beaver; but the point of the tail was  occasionally seen glancing upwards. He was a gigantic reptile, with the  face of a just man, very mild. He had shaggy claws for arms, and a body  variegated all over with colours that ran in knots and circles, each  within the other, richer than any Eastern drapery. Virgil spoke apart  to him, and then mounted on his back, bidding his companion, who was  speechless for terror, do the salve. Geryon pushed back with them from  the edge of the precipice, like a ship leaving harbour; and then,  turning about, wheeled, like a sullen successless falcon, slowly down  through the air in many a circuit. Dante would not have known that he  was going downward, but for the air that struck up wards on his face.  Presently they heard the crash of the waterfall on the circle below,  and then distinguished flaming fires and the noises of suffering.  The monster Geryon, ever sullen as the falcon who seats himself at a  distance from his dissatisfied master, shook his riders from off his  back to the water's side, and then shot away like an arrow.    This eighth circle of hell is called Evil-Budget,[24] and consists of  ten compartments, or gulfs of torment, crossed and connected with  one another by bridges of flint. In the first were beheld Pimps and  Seducers, scourged like children by horned devils; in the second,  Flatterers, begrimed with ordure; in the third, Simonists, who were  stuck like plugs into circular apertures, with their heads downwards,  and their legs only discernible, the soles of their feet glowing with a  fire which made them incessantly quiver. Dante, going down the side of  the gulf with Virgil, was allowed to address one of them who seemed in  greater agony than the rest; and, doing so, the sufferer cried out in a  malignant rapture, \"Aha, is it thou that standest there, Boniface?[25]  Thou hast come sooner than it was prophesied.\" It was the soul of Pope  Nicholas the Third that spoke. Dante undeceived and then sternly  rebuked him for his avarice and depravity, telling him that nothing but  reverence for the keys of St. Peter hindered him from using harsher  words, and that it was such as he that the Evangelist beheld in the  vision, when he saw the woman with seven heads and ten horns, who  committed whoredom with the kings of the earth.    \"O Constantine!\" exclaimed the poet, \"of what a world of evil was that  dowry the mother, which first converted the pastor of the church into a  rich man!\" [26] The feet of the guilty pope spun with fiercer agony at  these words; and Virgil, looking pleased on Dante, returned with him  the way he came, till they found themselves on the margin of the fourth  gulf, the habitation of the souls of False Prophets.    It was a valley, in which the souls came walking along, silent and  weeping, at the pace of choristers who chant litanies. Their faces were  turned the wrong way, so that the backs of their heads came foremost,  and their tears fell on their loins. Dante was so overcome at the sight,  that he leant against a rock and wept; but Virgil rebuked him, telling  him that no pity at all was the only pity fit for that place.[27] There  was Amphiaraus, whom the earth opened and swallowed up at Thebes; and  Tiresias, who was transformed from sex to sex; and Aruns, who lived in  a cavern on the side of the marble mountains of Carrara, looking out on  the stars and ocean; and Manto, daughter of Tiresias (her hind tresses  over her bosom), who wandered through the world till she came and lived  in the solitary fen, whence afterwards arose the city of Mantua; and  Michael Scot, the magician, with his slender loins;[28] and Eurypylus,  the Grecian augur, who gave the signal with Calchas at Troy when to cut  away the cables for home. He came stooping along, projecting his face  over his swarthy shoulders. Guido Bonatti, too, was there, astrologer of  Forli; and Ardente, shoemaker of Parma, who now wishes he had stuck to  his last; and the wretched women who quit the needle and the distaff to  wreak their malice with herbs and images. Such was the punishment of  those who, desiring to see too far before them, now looked only behind  them, and walked the reverse way of their looking.    The fifth gulf was a lake of boiling pitch, constantly heaving and  subsiding throughout, and bubbling with the breath of those within it.  They were Public Peculators. Winged black devils were busy about the  lake, pronging the sinners when they occasionally darted up their backs  for relief like dolphins, or thrust out their jaws like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#16)"],[1,"out by the tall man to lay for me.\"    \"What tall man?\" asked Calder, his wits groping.    \"The one that swung the chair in Morgan's place,\" said Dan. \"Now  you're goin' to take me to your camp. I got something to say to him.\"    \"By the Lord!\" cried the marshal, \"you're trailing Silent.\"    Dan watched him narrowly. It was hard to accuse those keen black eyes  of deceit.    \"I'm trailin' the man who sent you out after me,\" he asserted with a  little less assurance.    Calder tore open the front of his shirt and pushed back one side of  it. Pinned there next to his skin was his marshal's badge.    He said: \"My name's Tex Calder.\"    It was a word to conjure with up and down the vast expanse of the  mountain-desert. Dan smiled, and the change of expression made him  seem ten years younger.    \"Git down, Bart. Stand behind me!\" The dog obeyed sullenly. \"I've  heard a pile of men talk about you, Tex Calder.\" Their hands and their  eyes met. There was a mutual respect in the glances. \"An' I'm a pile  sorry for this.\"    He picked up the gun from the ground and extended it butt first to the  marshal, who restored it slowly to the holster. It was the first time  it had ever been forced from his grasp.    \"Who was it you talked about a while ago?\" asked Dan.    \"Jim Silent.\"    Dan instinctively dropped his hand back to his revolver.    \"The tall man?\"    \"The one you fought with in Morgan's place.\"    The unpleasant gleam returned to Dan's eyes.    \"I thought there was only one reason why he should die, but now I see  there's a heap of 'em.\"    Calder was all business.    \"How long have you been here?\" he asked.    \"About a day.\"    \"Have you seen anything of Silent here among the willows?\"    \"No.\"    \"Do you think he's still here?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I dunno. I'll stay here till I find him among the trees or he breaks  away into the open.\"    \"How'll you know when he leaves the willows?\"    Whistling Dan was puzzled.    \"I dunno,\" he answered. \"Somethin' will tell me when he gets far away  from me--he an' his men.\"    \"It's an inner sense, eh? Like the smell of the bloodhound?\" said  Calder, but his eyes were strangely serious.    \"This day's about done,\" he went on. \"Have you any objections to me  camping with you here?\"    Not a cowpuncher within five hundred miles but would be glad of such  redoubted company. They went back to Calder's horse.    \"We can start for my clearing,\" said Dan. \"Bart'll bring the hoss.  Fetch him in.\"    The wolf took the dangling bridle reins and led on the cowpony. Calder  observed his performance with starting eyes, but he was averse to  asking questions. In a few moments they came out on a small open  space. The ground was covered with a quantity of dried bunch grass  which a glorious black stallion was cropping. Now he tossed up his  head so that some of his long mane fell forward between his ears and  at sight of Calder his ears dropped back and his eyes blazed, but when  Dan stepped from the willows the ears came forward again with a  whinny of greeting. Calder watched the beautiful animal with all the  enthusiasm of an expert horseman. Satan was untethered; the saddle and  bridle lay in a corner of the clearing; evidently the horse was a pet  and would not leave its master. He spoke gently and stepped forward to  caress the velvet shining neck, but Satan snorted and started away,  trembling with excitement.    \"How can you keep such a wild fellow as this without hobbling him?\"  asked Calder.    \"He ain't wild,\" said Dan.    \"Why, he won't let me put a hand on him.\"    \"Yes, he will. Steady, Satan!\"    The stallion stood motionless with the veritable fires of hell in his  eyes as Calder approached. The latter stopped.    \"Not for me,\" he said. \"I'd rather rub the moustache of the lion in  the zoo than touch that black devil!\"    Bart at that moment led in the cowpony and Calder started to remove  the saddle. He had scarcely done so and hobbled his horse when he was  startled by a tremendous snarling and snorting. He turned to see the  stallion plunging hither and thither, striking with his fore-hooves,  while around him, darting in and out under the driving feet, sprang  the great black wolf, his teeth clashing like steel on steel. In  another moment they might sink in the throat of the horse! Calder,  with an exclamation of horror, whipped out his revolver, but checked  himself at the very instant of firing. The master of the two animals  stood with arms folded, actually smiling upon the fight!    \"For God's sake!\" cried the marshal. \"Shoot the damned wolf, man, or  he'll have your horse by the throat!\"    \"Leave 'em be,\" said Dan, without turning his head. \"Satan an' Black  Bart ain't got any other dogs an' hosses to run around with. They's  jest playing a little by way of exercise.\"    Calder stood agape before what seemed the incarnate fury of the pair.  Then he noticed that those snapping fangs, however close they came,  always missed the flesh of the stallion, and the driving hoofs never  actually endangered the leaping wolf.    \"Stop 'em!\" he cried at last. \"It makes me nervous to watch that sort  of play. It isn't natural!\"    \"All right,\" said Dan. \"Stop it, boys.\"    He had not raised his voice, but they ceased their wild gambols  instantly, the stallion, with head thrown high and arched tail and  heaving sides, while the wolf, with lolling red tongue, strolled  calmly towards his master.    The latter paid no further attention to them, but set about kindling a  small fire over which to cook supper. Calder joined him. The marshal's  mind was too full for speech, but now and again he turned a long  glance of wonder upon the stallion or Black Bart. In the same silence  they sat under the last light of the sunset and ate their supper.  Calder, with head bent, pondered over the man of mystery and his two  tamed animals. Tamed? Not one of the three was tamed, the man least of  all.    He saw Dan pause from his eating to stare with wide, vacant eyes among  the trees. The wolf-dog approached, looked up in his master's face,  whined softly, and getting no response went back to his place and lay  down, his eyes never moving from Dan. Still he stared among the trees.  The gloom deepened, and he smiled faintly. He began to whistle, a low,  melancholy strain so soft that it blended with the growing hush of the  night. Calder listened, wholly overawed. That weird music seemed an  interpretation of the vast spaces of the mountains, of the pitiless  desert, of the limitless silences, and the whistler was an  understanding part of the whole.    He became aware of a black shadow behind the musician. It was Satan,  who rested his nose on the shoulder of the master. Without ceasing his  whistling Dan raised a hand, touched the small muzzle, and Satan went  at once to a side of the clearing and lay down. It was almost as if  the two had said good-night! Calder could stand it no longer.    \"Dan, I've got to talk to you,\" he began.    The whistling ceased; the wide brown eyes turned to him.    \"Fire away--partner.\"    Ay, they had eaten together by the same fire--they had watched the  coming of the night--they had shaken hands in friendship--they were  partners. He knew deep in his heart that no human being could ever  be the actual comrade of this man. This lord of the voiceless desert  needed no human companionship; yet as the marshal glanced from the  black shadow of Satan to the gleaming eyes of Bart, and then to  the visionary face of Barry, he felt that he had been admitted by  Whistling Dan into the mysterious company. The thought stirred him  deeply. It was as if he had made an alliance with the wandering wind.  Why he had been accepted he could not dream, but he had heard the word  \"partner\" and he knew it was meant. After all, stranger things  than this happen in the mountain-desert, where man is greater and  convention less. A single word has been known to estrange lifelong  comrades; a single evening beside a camp-fire has changed foes to  partners. Calder drew his mind back to business with a great effort.    \"There's one thing you don't know about Jim Silent. A reward of ten  thousand dollars lies on his head. The notices aren't posted yet.\"    Whistling Dan shrugged his shoulders.    \"I ain't after money,\" he answered.    Calder frowned. He did not appreciate a bluff.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"if we kill him, because no power on earth will  take him alive--we'll split the money.\"    \"If you lay a hand on him,\" said Dan, without emotion, \"we won't be  friends no longer, I figger.\"    Calder stared.    \"If you don't want to get him,\" he said, \"why in God's name are you  trailing him this way?\"    Dan touched his lips. \"He hit me with his fist.\"    He paused, and spoke again with a drawling voice that gave his words  an uncanny effect.    \"My blood went down from my mouth to my chin. I tasted it. Till I get  him there ain't no way of me forgettin' him.\"    His eyes lighted with that ominous gleam.    \"That's why no other man c'n put a hand on him. He's laid out all for  me. Understand?\"    The ring of the question echoed for a moment through Calder's mind.    \"I certainly do,\" he said with profound conviction, \"and I'll never  forget it.\" He decided on a change of tactics. \"But there are other  men with Jim Silent and those men will fight to keep you from getting  to him.\"    \"I'm sorry for 'em,\" said Dan gently. \"I ain't got nothin' agin any  one except the big man.\"    Calder took a long breath.    \"Don't you see,\" he explained carefully, \"if you shoot one of these  men you are simply a murderer who must be apprehended by the law and  punished.\"    \"It makes it bad for me, doesn't it?\" said Dan. \"An' I hope I won't  have to hurt more'n one or two of 'em. You see,\"--he leaned forward  seriously towards Calder--\"I'd only shoot for their arms or their  legs. I wouldn't spoil them altogether.\"    Calder threw up his hands in despair. Black Bart snarled at the  gesture.  "]]]
