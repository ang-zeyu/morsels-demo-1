[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#15)"],[1,"the strangers should be put to death.  And we pray your Supreme  Highnesses to favor our wish.\"    The two little maids looked from the Ki to the Ki-Ki, and frowned and  pouted their rosy lips in evident perplexity.    But Nerle whispered to Prince Marvel:    \"It's all up with us!  I know very well why her royal doublets always  favors the Ki-Ki.  It's because they are young and handsome, while the  Ki are old and ugly.  Both of her will condemn us to death--you see if  she don't!\"    This seemed somewhat mixed, but Nerle was in earnest, and Prince  Marvel, who had not forgotten his fairy lore, began to weave a silent  spell over the head of the nearest twin High Ki.  But just as it was  completed, and before he had time to work the spell on the other twin,  the Ki-Ki grew impatient, and exclaimed:    \"We beg your Highnesses not to keep us waiting.  Let us have your  decision at once!\"    And the twin maidens raised their fair heads and replied.  But the  reply was of such a nature that both the old Ki and both the young  Ki-Ki staggered backward in amazement.  For one of the twin High Ki  said:    \"They shall die!\"    And the other twin High Ki said at the same instant:    \"They shall NOT die!\"    Had twin thunderbolts fallen through the twin roofs of the twin palaces  and struck the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki upon their twin heads it  would have created no more stupendous a sensation than did this remark.  Never before had any two halves of a twin of the Land of Twi thought  differently or spoken differently.  Indeed, it startled the two maidens  themselves as much as it did their hearers, for each one turned her  head toward the other and, for the first time in her life, looked into  the other's face!    This act was fully as strange as their speech, and a sudden horrible  thought came into the startled heads of the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki:  THE HIGH KI OF TWI WAS NO LONGER ONE, BUT TWO.  AND THESE TWO WERE  THINKING AND ACTING EACH INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER!    It is no wonder the shock rendered them speechless for a time, and they  stood swaying their four bodies, with their eight eyes bulging out like  those of fishes and their four mouths wide open, as if the two pairs  had become one quartet.    The faces of the two maids flushed as they gazed upon each other.    \"How DARE you contradict me?\" asked one.    \"How dare you contradict ME?\" demanded the other, and not only were  these questions asked separately, but the accent on the words was  different.  And their twin minds seemed to get farther apart every  moment.    \"I'm the High Ki of Twi!\" said one.    \"You're not!  I'M the High Ki!\" retorted the other.    \"The strangers shall die!\" snapped one.    \"They shall live!\" cried the other.  \"My will is supreme.\"    \"It's not!  MY will is supreme,\" returned the other twin.    The bald heads of the ancient Ki were bobbing in amazement, first to  one maid and then toward the other.  The blond hairs of the two Ki-Ki  were standing almost on end, and their eyes stared straight before them  as if stupefied with astonishment.  Nerle was bellowing with rude  laughter and holding his sides to keep from getting a stitch in them,  while Prince Marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine  amusement.  For he alone understood what had happened to separate the  twin High Ki.    The girls did not seem to know how to act under their altered  conditions.  After a time one of them said:    \"We will leave our dispute to be settled by the Ki and the Ki-Ki.\"    \"Very well,\" agreed the other.    \"Then I say your half is right,\" declared the Ki-Ki, both their right  forefingers pointing to the maiden who had condemned the strangers to  death.    \"And I decide that your half is right,\" exclaimed the Ki, both their  trembling forefingers pointing to the maiden who had said the strangers  should live.    \"Well?\" said one girl.    \"Well?\" said the other.    \"The powers of the Ki and the Ki-Ki are equal,\" said the first.  \"We  are no nearer a settlement of our dispute than we were before.\"    \"My dear young ladies,\" said Prince Marvel, politely, \"I beg you will  take time to think the matter over, and see if you can not come to an  agreement.  We are in no hurry.\"    \"Very well,\" decided the twins, speaking both together this time.  \"We  command you all to remain in the palace until we have settled our own  strange dispute.  The servants will care for you, and when we are ready  to announce our decision we shall again send for you.\"    Every one bowed at this command and retired from the room; but Nerle  looked over his shoulder as he went through the doorway, and saw that  the two High Ki had turned in their seats and were facing each other,  and that both their faces wore angry and determined expressions.        17.  The Separation of the High Ki    For nearly a week Prince Marvel and Nerle remained confined to the  palace and gardens of the High Ki.  Together with the twin Ki, who  seemed to be friendly to them, they occupied one of the twin palaces,  while the Ki-Ki secluded themselves in the other.    The pretty High Ki maidens they did not see at all, nor did they know  what part of the palaces they occupied, not being permitted to wander  away from the rooms allotted to them, except to walk in the garden.  There was no way for them to escape, had they felt inclined to, for the  silver steps had disappeared.    From the garden walks they sometimes caught sight of the solemn heads  of the handsome Ki-Ki looking at them through the twin windows of the  other palace, and although the expression of their faces was always  mild and gentle, Nerle and Marvel well knew the Ki-Ki were only waiting  in the hope of having them killed.    \"Are you nervous about the decision of the pretty High Ki?\" asked Nerle  one day.    \"No, indeed,\" said the prince, laughing; \"for I do not expect them to  kill me, in any event.\"    \"If I felt as sure of my safety,\" returned the boy, \"it would destroy  all my pleasure.  These are really happy days for me.  Every moment I  expect to see the executioner arrive with his ax.\"    \"The executioner is double,\" said the two old Ki, breaking into the  conversation.  \"You should say you expect to see the executioners  arrive with their axes.\"    \"Then how will they cut off my head with two axes?  For I suppose they  will both chop at the same time, and I have but one neck.\"    \"Wait and see,\" answered the two Ki, sighing deeply and rubbing their  red noses thoughtfully.    \"Oh, I'll wait,\" answered the boy; \"but as for seeing them cut off my  head, I refuse; for I intend to shut my eyes.\"    So they sat in their rooms or walked in the gardens, yawning and  waiting, until one day, just as the two clocks on the wall were  striking twenty-four o'clock, the door opened and to their surprise one  of the High Ki twins walked in upon them.    She was as sweet and fair to look upon as when she occupied one of the  beautiful thrones, but at first no one could tell which of the High Ki  she was--their friend or their enemy.  Even the Ki were puzzled and  anxious, until the girl said:    \"My other half and I have completely separated, for we have agreed to  disagree for all time.  And she has gone to ask the Ki-Ki to assist  her, for war is declared between us.  And hereafter her color is to be  the green and mine the yellow, and we intend to fight until one of us  conquers and overthrows the other.\"    This announcement was interesting to Marvel and Nerle, but greatly  shocked the aged Ki, who asked:    \"What is to become of our kingdom?  Half of a High Ki can not rule it.  It is against the law.\"    \"I will make my own laws when I have won the fight,\" returned the girl,  with a lovely smile; \"so do not let that bother you.  And now tell me,  will you help me to fight my battles?\"    \"Willingly!\" exclaimed Nerle and Prince Marvel, almost as if they had  been twins of Twi.  And the Ki rubbed their bald heads a moment, and  then sneezed together and wiped their eyes on faded yellow  handkerchiefs, and finally declared they would \"stick to her Supreme  Highness through thick and thin!\"    \"Then go over the wall to the cities, at once, and get together all the  soldiers to fight for me and my cause,\" commanded the girl.    The twin Ki at once left the room, and the High Ki sat down and began  to ask questions of Prince Marvel and Nerle about the big outside world  from whence they came.  Nerle was rather shy and bashful before the  dainty little maiden, whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with  her pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks; but Prince  Marvel did not mind girls at all, so he talked with her freely, and she  in return allowed him to examine the pretty gold crown she wore upon  her brow.    By and by the Ki came back with both faces sad and gloomy.    \"Your Highness,\" they announced, \"we have bad news for you.  The other  High Ki, who is wearing a green gown, has been more prompt in action  than yourself.  She and the Ki-Ki have secured the silver steps and  will allow no others to use them; and already they have sent for the  soldiers of the royal armies to come and aid them.  So we are unable to  leave the garden, and presently the army will be here to destroy us.\"    Then the girl showed her good courage; for she laughed and said:    \"Then we must remain here and fight to the last; and if I am unable to  save you, who are my friends, it will be because I can not save myself.\"    This speech pleased Prince Marvel greatly.  He kissed the little maid's  hand respectfully and said:    \"Fear nothing, your Highness.  My friend and I are not so helpless as  you think.  We consider it our privilege to protect and save you,  instead of your saving us; and we are really able to do this in spite  of the other High Ki and her entire army.\"    So they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day, and no one  molested them in the least.  In the evening the girl played and sang  for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#15)"],[1,"PA's definitions, the filters' own category criteria,  or against the standard that the Janes study used.  Edelman  tested only 500,000 unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many,  or two billion, that are estimated to exist in the indexable Web.   Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that were most likely  to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we  conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman  identified are erroneously blocked by one or more of the  filtering programs that he tested.  Edelman's and Janes's studies provide numerous specific  examples of Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or  more filtering programs.  The Web pages that were erroneously  blocked by one or more of the filtering programs do not fall into  any neat patterns; they range widely in subject matter, and it is  difficult to tell why they may have been overblocked.  The list  that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pages relating  to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education,  travel, sports, and many other topics.  In the next section, we  provide examples from each of these categories.  6.        Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites      Several of the erroneously blocked Web sites had content  relating to churches, religious orders, religious charities, and  religious fellowship organizations.  These included the following  Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men's  group associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada,  http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828, which was  blocked by Cyber Patrol in the \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\"  category; the Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas,  http://www.agapechurch.com, which was blocked by Websense as  \"Adult Content\"; the home page of the Lesbian and Gay Havurah of  the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center,  http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm, which was blocked by  N2H2 as \"Adults Only, Pornography,\" by Smartfilter as \"Sex,\" and  by Websense as \"Sex\"; Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage  in Honduras that houses 225 children,  http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb_viva, which was blocked by Cyber  Patrol in the \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\" category; Vision Art  Online, which sells wooden wall hangings for the home that  contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and images of the Star  of David, http://www.visionartonline.com, which was blocked in  Websense's \"Sex\" category; and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a  Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to  build a Buddhist nunnery and international retreat center for  women, http://www.tenzinpalmo.com, which was categorized as  \"Nudity\" by N2H2.      Several blocked sites also contained information about  governmental entities or specific political candidates, or  contained political commentary.  These included: the Web site for  Kelley Ross, a Libertarian candidate for the California State  Assembly, http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40, which N2H2 blocked  as \"Nudity\"; the Web site for Bob Coughlin, a town selectman in  Dedham, Massachusetts, http://www.bobcoughlin.org, which was  blocked under N2H2's \"Nudity\" category; a list of Web sites  containing information about government and politics in Adams  County, Pennsylvania, http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa, which  was blocked by Websense as \"Sex\"; the Web site for Wisconsin  Right to Life, http://www.wrtl.org, which N2H2 blocked as  \"Nudity\"; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda,  http://federo.com, which N2H2 blocked as \"Adults Only,  Pornography\"; \"Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,\" a Danish Web  site dedicated to criticizing the American system of capital  punishment, http://www.fdp.dk, which N2H2 blocked as  \"Pornography\"; and \"Dumb Laws,\" a humor Web site that makes fun  of outmoded laws, http://www.dumblaws.com, which N2H2 blocked  under its \"Sex\" category.  Erroneously blocked Web sites relating to health issues  included the following: a guide to allergies, http://www.x-  sitez.com/allergy, which was categorized as \"Adults Only,  Pornography\" by N2H2; a health question and answer site sponsored  by Columbia University, http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu,  which was blocked as \"Sex\" by N2H2, and as \"Mature\" by  Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home Page,  http://www.usinter.net/wasa, which was blocked by N2H2 as  \"Pornography\"; the Web site of the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center,  a Shreveport, Louisiana cancer treatment facility,  http://cancerftr.wkmc.com, which was blocked by Websense under  the \"Sex\" category; and a site dealing with halitosis,  http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs, which was blocked by N2H2 as  \"Adults, Pornography,\" by Smartfilter as \"Sex,\" by Cyber Patrol  as \"Adult/Sexually Explicit,\" and by Websense as \"Adult Content.\"        The filtering programs also erroneously blocked several Web  sites having to do with education and careers.  The filtering  programs blocked two sites that provide information on home  schooling.  \"HomEduStation  the Internet Source for Home  Education,\" http://www.perigee.net/~mcmullen/homedustation/, was  categorized by Cyber Patrol as \"Adult/Sexually Explicit.\"  Smartfilter blocked \"Apricot: A Web site made by and for home  schoolers,\" http://apricotpie.com, as \"Sex.\"  The programs also  miscategorized several career-related sites.  \"Social Work  Search,\" http://www.socialworksearch.com/, is a directory for  social workers that Cyber Patrol placed in its \"Adult/Sexually  Explicit\" category.  The \"Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Southern  Nevada,\" http://www.lambdalv.com, \"a forum for the business  community to develop relationships within the Las Vegas lesbian,  gay, transsexual, and bisexual community\" was blocked by N2H2 as  \"Adults Only, Pornography.\"  A site for aspiring dentists,  http://www.vvm.com/~bond/home.htm, was blocked by Cyber Patrol in  its \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\" category.  The filtering programs erroneously blocked many travel Web  sites, including: the Web site for the Allen Farmhouse Bed &  Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina, http://planet-  nc.com/Beth/index.html, which Websense blocked as \"Adult  Content\"; Odysseus Gay Travel, a travel company serving gay men,  http://www.odyusa.com, which N2H2 categorized as \"Adults Only,  Pornography\"; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters,  http://albertaflyfish.com, which N2H2 blocked as \"Pornography\";  and \"Nature and Culture Conscious Travel,\" a tour operator in  Namibia, http://www.trans-namibia-tours.com, which was  categorized as \"Pornography\" by N2H2.      The filtering programs also miscategorized a large number of  sports Web sites.  These included: a site devoted to Willie  O'Ree, the first African-American player in the National Hockey  League, http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html, which Websense  blocked under its \"Nudity\" category; the home page of the Sydney  University Australian Football Club, http://www.tek.com.au/suafc,  which N2H2 blocked as \"Adults Only, Pornography,\" Smartfilter  blocked as \"Sex,\" Cyber Patrol blocked as \"Adult/Sexually  Explicit\" and Websense blocked as \"Sex\"; and a fan's page devoted  to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team,  http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com, which N2H2 blocked  under the \"Pornography\" category.  7.        Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering  Programs  Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing  with problems created by the provision of Internet access.  The  large amount of sexually explicit speech that is freely available  on the Internet has, to varying degrees, led to patron complaints  about such matters as unsought exposure to offensive material,  incidents of staff and patron harassment by individuals viewing  sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of library  computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography.   In some libraries, youthful library patrons have persistently  attempted to use the Internet to access hardcore pornography.      Those public libraries that have responded to these problems  by using software filters have found such filters to provide a  relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing  sexually explicit material on the Internet.  Nonetheless, out of  the entire universe of speech on the Internet falling within the  filtering products' category definitions, the filters will  incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech.  Thus,  software filters have not completely eliminated the problems that  public libraries have sought to address by using the filters, as  evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking.  Nor is there  any quantitative evidence of the relative effectiveness of  filters and the alternatives to filters that are also intended to  prevent patrons from accessing illegal content on the Internet.  Even more importantly (for this case), although software  filters provide a relatively cheap and effective, albeit  imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from  accessing speech that falls within the filters' category  definitions, we find that commercially available filtering  programs erroneously block a huge amount of speech that is  protected by the First Amendment.  Any currently available  filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing  users from accessing content within the filter's category  definitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Web  pages, the content of which does not match the filtering  company's category definitions, much less the legal definitions  of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  Even  Finnell, an expert witness for the defendants, found that between  6% and 15% of the blocked Web sites in the public libraries that  he analyzed did not contain content that meets even the filtering  products' own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone  CIPA's definitions.      This phenomenon occurs for a number of reasons"]]]
