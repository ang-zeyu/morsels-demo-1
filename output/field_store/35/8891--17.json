(#15)"],[1," Her milder sway endures, then riseth up  The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,  And looking out beholds the plain around  All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites  His thighs, and to his hut returning in,  There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,  As a discomfited and helpless man;  Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope  Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon  The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,  And forth to pasture drives his little flock:  So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw  His troubled forehead, and so speedily  That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge  Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,  He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld  At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well  The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd  With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm  And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,  Computes his labour's issue, that he seems  Still to foresee the effect, so lifting me  Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd  His eye upon another.  \"Grapple that,\"  Said he, \"but first make proof, if it be such  As will sustain thee.\"  For one capp'd with lead  This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,  And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,  Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast  Were not less ample than the last, for him  I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd.  But Malebolge all toward the mouth  Inclining of the nethermost abyss,  The site of every valley hence requires,  That one side upward slope, the other fall.    At length the point of our descent we reach'd  From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,  So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,  I could no further, but did seat me there.    \"Now needs thy best of man;\" so spake my guide:  \"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade  Of canopy reposing, fame is won,  Without which whosoe'er consumes his days  Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,  As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.  Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness  By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd  To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight  Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.  A longer ladder yet remains to scale.  From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.  If well thou note me, profit by my words.\"    I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent  Than I in truth did feel me.  \"On,\" I cried,  \"For I am stout and fearless.\"  Up the rock  Our way we held, more rugged than before,  Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk  I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem  Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss  Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.  Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,  What were the words I knew not, but who spake  Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,  But my quick eye might reach not to the depth  For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:  \"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,  And from the wall dismount we; for as hence  I hear and understand not, so I see  Beneath, and naught discern.\"--\"I answer not,\"  Said he, \"but by the deed.  To fair request  Silent performance maketh best return.\"    We from the bridge's head descended, where  To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm  Opening to view, I saw a crowd within  Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape  And hideous, that remembrance in my veins  Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands  Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,  Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,  Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire  Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,  Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er  Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.    Amid this dread exuberance of woe  Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,  Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,  Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.  With serpents were their hands behind them bound,  Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head  Twisted in folds before.  And lo! on one  Near to our side, darted an adder up,  And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,  Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen  Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd  To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth.  When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again  Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form  Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,  The Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years  Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith  Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life  He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone  And odorous amomum: swaths of nard  And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,  He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd  To earth, or through obstruction fettering up  In chains invisible the powers of man,  Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,  Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony  He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;  So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.    Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out  Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was  My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few  He answer'd: \"Vanni Fucci am I call'd,  Not long since rained down from Tuscany  To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life  And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,  Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.\"    I then to Virgil: \"Bid him stir not hence,  And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once  A man I knew him choleric and bloody.\"    The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me  His mind directing and his face, wherein  Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:  \"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee  In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than  When I was taken from the other life.  I have no power permitted to deny  What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low  To dwell, for that the sacristy by me  Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,  And with the guilt another falsely charged.  But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,  So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm  Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.  Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,  Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.  From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,  A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,  And sharp and eager driveth on the storm  With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,  Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike  Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.  This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.\"          CANTO XXV    WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands  Pointed in mockery, and cried: \"Take them, God!  I level them at thee!\"  From that day forth  The serpents were my friends; for round his neck  One of then rolling twisted, as it said,  \"Be silent, tongue!\"  Another to his arms  Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself  So close, it took from them the power to move.    Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt  To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth  No longer, since in evil act so far  Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,  Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss,  Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,  Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,  Nor utter'd more; and after him there came  A centaur full of fury, shouting, \"Where  Where is the caitiff?\"  On Maremma's marsh  Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch  They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.  Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,  With open wings, a dragon breathing fire  On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:  \"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock  Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.  He, from his brethren parted, here must tread  A different journey, for his fraudful theft  Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found  His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace  Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on  A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.\"    While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:  And under us three spirits came, of whom  Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;  \"Say who are ye?\"  We then brake off discourse,  Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;  But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one  Had need to name another.  \"Where,\" said he,  \"Doth Cianfa lurk?\"  I, for a sign my guide  Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips  The finger lifted.  If, O reader! now  Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,  No marvel; for myself do scarce allow  The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked  Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet  Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:  His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot  Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek  He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs  Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd  Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd  A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs  The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.  Then, as they both had been of burning wax,  Each melted into other, mingling hues,  That which was either now was seen no more.  Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,  A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,  And the clean white expires.  The other two  Look'd on exclaiming: \"Ah, how dost thou change,  Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,    \"Nor only one.\"  The two heads now became  One, and two figures blended in one form  Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths  Two arms were made: the belly and the chest  The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,  As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape  All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd  That image miscreate, and so pass'd on  With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge  Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,  Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems  A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,  So toward th' entrails of the other two  Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,  As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.  In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,  One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell  Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him  But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#15)"],[1,"Is he to speak, whom other will employs.\"    He thus: \"The water and tee plant we pass'd,  Virtue possesses, by th' eternal will  Infus'd, the which so pines me.  Every spirit,  Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg'd  Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst  Is purified.  The odour, which the fruit,  And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,  Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.  Nor once alone encompassing our route  We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:  Pain, said Iolace rather: for that will  To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led  To call Elias, joyful when he paid  Our ransom from his vein.\"  I answering thus:  \"Forese! from that day, in which the world  For better life thou changedst, not five years  Have circled.  If the power of sinning more  Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew'st  That kindly grief, which re-espouses us  To God, how hither art thou come so soon?  I thought to find thee lower, there, where time  Is recompense for time.\"  He straight replied:  \"To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction  I have been brought thus early by the tears  Stream'd down my Nella's cheeks.  Her prayers devout,  Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft  Expectance lingers, and have set me free  From th' other circles.  In the sight of God  So much the dearer is my widow priz'd,  She whom I lov'd so fondly, as she ranks  More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.  The tract most barb'rous of Sardinia's isle,  Hath dames more chaste and modester by far  Than that wherein I left her.  O sweet brother!  What wouldst thou have me say?  A time to come  Stands full within my view, to which this hour  Shall not be counted of an ancient date,  When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn'd  Th' unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare  Unkerchief'd bosoms to the common gaze.  What savage women hath the world e'er seen,  What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge  Of spiritual or other discipline,  To force them walk with cov'ring on their limbs!  But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav'n  Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,  Their mouths were op'd for howling: they shall taste  Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)  Or ere the cheek of him be cloth'd with down  Who is now rock'd with lullaby asleep.  Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,  Thou seest how not I alone but all  Gaze, where thou veil'st the intercepted sun.\"    Whence I replied: \"If thou recall to mind  What we were once together, even yet  Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.  That I forsook that life, was due to him  Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,  When she was round, who shines with sister lamp  To his, that glisters yonder,\" and I show'd  The sun.  \"Tis he, who through profoundest night  Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh  As true, that follows.  From that gloom the aid  Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,  And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,  Which rectifies in you whate'er the world  Made crooked and deprav'd I have his word,  That he will bear me company as far  As till I come where Beatrice dwells:  But there must leave me.  Virgil is that spirit,  Who thus hath promis'd,\"  and I pointed to him;  \"The other is that shade, for whom so late  Your realm, as he arose, exulting shook  Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound.\"          CANTO XXIV    Our journey was not slacken'd by our talk,  Nor yet our talk by journeying.  Still we spake,  And urg'd our travel stoutly, like a ship  When the wind sits astern.  The shadowy forms,    That seem'd things dead and dead again, drew in  At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,  Perceiving I had life; and I my words  Continued, and thus spake; \"He journeys up  Perhaps more tardily then else he would,  For others' sake.  But tell me, if thou know'st,  Where is Piccarda?  Tell me, if I see  Any of mark, among this multitude,  Who eye me thus.\"--\"My sister (she for whom,  'Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say  Which name was fitter ) wears e'en now her crown,  And triumphs in Olympus.\"  Saying this,  He added: \"Since spare diet hath so worn  Our semblance out, 't is lawful here to name  Each one.  This,\" and his finger then he rais'd,  \"Is Buonaggiuna,--Buonaggiuna, he  Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc'd  Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,  Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,  And purges by wan abstinence away  Bolsena's eels and cups of muscadel.\"    He show'd me many others, one by one,  And all, as they were nam'd, seem'd well content;  For no dark gesture I discern'd in any.  I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind  His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,  That wav'd the crozier o'er a num'rous flock.  I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile  To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so  Was one ne'er sated.  I howe'er, like him,  That gazing 'midst a crowd, singles out one,  So singled him of Lucca; for methought  Was none amongst them took such note of me.  Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:  The sound was indistinct, and murmur'd there,  Where justice, that so strips them, fix'd her sting.    \"Spirit!\" said I, \"it seems as thou wouldst fain  Speak with me.  Let me hear thee.  Mutual wish  To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.\"    He, answ'ring, straight began: \"Woman is born,  Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make  My city please thee, blame it as they may.  Go then with this forewarning.  If aught false  My whisper too implied, th' event shall tell  But say, if of a  truth I see the man  Of that new lay th' inventor, which begins  With 'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love'.\"    To whom I thus: \"Count of me but as one  Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,  Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.\"    \"Brother!\" said he, \"the hind'rance which once held  The notary with Guittone and myself,  Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,  Is now disclos'd.  I see how ye your plumes  Stretch, as th' inditer guides them; which, no question,  Ours did not.  He that seeks a grace beyond,  Sees not the distance parts one style from other.\"  And, as contented, here he held his peace.    Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,  In squared regiment direct their course,  Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;  Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn'd  Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike  Through leanness and desire.  And as a man,  Tir'd With the motion of a trotting steed,  Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,  Till his o'erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;  E'en so Forese let that holy crew  Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,  And saying: \"When shall I again behold thee?\"    \"How long my life may last,\" said I, \"I know not;  This know, how soon soever I return,  My wishes will before me have arriv'd.  Sithence the place, where I am set to live,  Is, day by day, more scoop'd of all its good,  And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.\"    \"Go now,\" he cried: \"lo! he, whose guilt is most,  Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels  Of an infuriate beast.  Toward the vale,  Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,  Each step increasing swiftness on the last;  Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him  A corse most vilely shatter'd.  No long space  Those wheels have yet to roll\"  (therewith his eyes  Look'd up to heav'n) \"ere thou shalt plainly see  That which my words may not more plainly tell.  I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose  Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.\"    As from a troop of well-rank'd chivalry  One knight, more enterprising than the rest,  Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display  His prowess in the first encounter prov'd  So parted he from us with lengthen'd strides,  And left me on the way with those twain spirits,  Who were such mighty marshals of the world.    When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes  No nearer reach'd him, than my thought his words,  The branches of another fruit, thick hung,  And blooming fresh, appear'd.  E'en as our steps  Turn'd thither, not far off it rose to view.  Beneath it were a multitude, that rais'd  Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What  Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,  That beg, and answer none obtain from him,  Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,  He at arm's length the object of their wish  Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.    At length, as undeceiv'd they went their way:  And we approach the tree, who vows and tears  Sue to in vain, the mighty tree.  \"Pass on,  And come not near.  Stands higher up the wood,  Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta'en  'this plant.\" Such sounds from midst the thickets came.  Whence I, with either bard, close to the side  That rose, pass'd forth beyond.  \"Remember,\" next  We heard, \"those noblest creatures of the clouds,  How they their twofold bosoms overgorg'd  Oppos'd in fight to Theseus: call to mind  The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop'd  To ease their thirst; whence Gideon's ranks were thinn'd,  As he to Midian march'd adown the hills.\"    Thus near one border coasting, still we heard  The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile  Reguerdon'd.  Then along the lonely path,  Once more at large, full thousand paces on  We travel'd, each contemplative and mute.    \"Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?\"  Thus suddenly a voice exclaim'd: whereat  I shook, as doth a scar'd and paltry beast;  Then rais'd my head to look from whence it came.    Was ne'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen  So bright and glowing red, as was the shape  I now beheld.  \"If ye desire to mount,\"  He cried, \"here must ye turn.  This way he goes,  Who goes in quest of peace.\"  His countenance  Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac'd  Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs.    As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up  On freshen'd wing the air of May, and breathes  Of fragrance, all impregn'd with herb and flowers,  E'en such a wind I felt upon my front"]]]
