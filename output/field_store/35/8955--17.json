Once or twice Leothric saw a star blink  for an instant and reappear again, and this momentary eclipse of a  few stars was all that remained in the world of the body of Thok.  And Lunk, the brother of Thok, who had lain a little behind him, saw  that this must be Sacnoth and fled lumbering away.  And all the while  that he walked between the abysses, the mighty vault of the roof of  the fortress still stretched over Leothric's head, all filled with  gloom.  Now, when the further side of the abyss came into view,  Leothric saw a chamber that opened with innumerable arches upon the  twin abysses, and the pillars of the arches went away into the  distance and vanished in the gloom to left and right.    Far down the dim precipice on which the pillars stood he could see  windows small and closely barred, and between the bars there showed  at moments, and disappeared again, things that I shall not speak of.    There was no light here except for the great Southern stars that  shone below the abysses, and here and there in the chamber through  the arches lights that moved furtively without the sound of  footfall.    Then Leothric stepped from the way, and entered the great chamber.    Even to himself he seemed but a tiny dwarf as he walked under one of  those colossal arches.    The last faint light of evening flickered through a window painted  in sombre colours commemorating the achievements of Satan upon  Earth.  High up in the wall the window stood, and the streaming  lights of candles lower down moved stealthily away.    Other light there was none, save for a faint blue glow from the  steel eye of Tharagavverug that peered restlessly about it from the  hilt of Sacnoth.  Heavily in the chamber hung the clammy odour of a  large and deadly beast.    Leothric moved forward slowly with the blade of Sacnoth in  front of him feeling for a foe, and the eye in the hilt of it looking  out behind.    Nothing stirred.    If anything lurked behind the pillars of the colonnade that held  aloft the roof, it neither breathed nor moved.    The music of the magical musicians sounded from very near.    Suddenly the great doors on the far side of the chamber opened to  left and right.  For some moments Leothric saw nothing move, and  waited clutching Sacnoth.  Then Wong Bongerok came towards him,  breathing.    This was the last and faithfullest guard of Gaznak, and came from  slobbering just now his master's hand.    More as a child than a dragon was Gaznak wont to treat him, giving  him often in his fingers tender pieces of man all smoking from his  table.    Long and low was Wong Bongerok, and subtle about the eyes, and he  came breathing malice against Leothric out of his faithful breast,  and behind him roared the armoury of his tail, as when sailors drag  the cable of the anchor all rattling down the deck.    And well Wong Bongerok knew that he now faced Sacnoth, for it had  been his wont to prophesy quietly to himself for many years as he  lay curled at the feet of Gaznak.    And Leothric stepped forward into the blast of his breath, and  lifted Sacnoth to strike.    But when Sacnoth was lifted up, the eye of Tharagavverug in the butt  of the hilt beheld the dragon and perceived his subtlety.    For he opened his mouth wide, and revealed to Leothric the ranks of  his sabre teeth, and his leather gums flapped upwards.  But while  Leothric made to smite at his head, he shot forward scorpion-wise  over his head the length of his armoured tail.  All this the eye  perceived in the hilt of Sacnoth, who smote suddenly sideways.  Not  with the edge smote Sacnoth, for, had he done so, the severed end of  the tail had still come hurtling on, as some pine tree that the  avalanche has hurled point foremost from the cliff right through the  broad breast of some mountaineer.  So had Leothric been transfixed;  but Sacnoth smote sideways with the flat of his blade, and sent the  tail whizzing over Leothric's left shoulder; and it rasped upon his  armour as it went, and left a groove upon it.  Sideways then at  Leothric smote the foiled tail of Wong Bongerok, and Sacnoth parried,  and the tail went shrieking up the blade and over Leothric's head.  Then Leothric and Wong Bongerok fought sword to tooth, and the  sword smote as only Sacnoth can, and the evil faithful life of Wong  Bongerok the dragon went out through the wide wound.    Then Leothric walked on past that dead monster, and the armoured  body still quivered a little.  And for a while it was like all the  ploughshares in a county working together in one field behind tired  and struggling horses; then the quivering ceased, and Wong Bongerok  lay still to rust.    And Leothric went on to the open gates, and Sacnoth dripped quietly  along the floor.    By the open gates through which Wong Bongerok had entered, Leothric  came into a corridor echoing with music.  This was the first place  from which Leothric could see anything above his head, for hitherto  the roof had ascended to mountainous heights and had stretched  indistinct in the gloom.  But along the narrow corridor hung huge  bells low and near to his head, and the width of each brazen bell  was from wall to wall, and they were one behind the other.  And as he  passed under each the bell uttered, and its voice was mournful and  deep, like to the voice of a bell speaking to a man for the last  time when he is newly dead.  Each bell uttered once as Leothric came  under it, and their voices sounded solemnly and wide apart at  ceremonious intervals.  For if he walked slow, these bells came  closer together, and when he walked swiftly they moved farther  apart.  And the echoes of each bell tolling above his head went on  before him whispering to the others.  Once when he stopped they all  jangled angrily till he went on again.    Between these slow and boding notes came the sound of the magical  musicians.  They were playing a dirge now very mournfully.    And at last Leothric came to the end of the Corridor of the Bells,  and beheld there a small black door.  And all the corridor behind him  was full of the echoes of the tolling, and they all muttered to one  another about the ceremony; and the dirge of the musicians came  floating slowly through them like a procession of foreign elaborate  guests, and all of them boded ill to Leothric.    The black door opened at once to the hand of Leothric, and he found  himself in the open air in a wide court paved with marble.  High over  it shone the moon, summoned there by the hand of Gaznak.    There Gaznak slept, and around him sat his magical musicians, all  playing upon strings.  And, even sleeping, Gaznak was clad in armour,  and only his wrists and face and neck were bare.    But the marvel of that place was the dreams of Gaznak; for beyond  the wide court slept a dark abyss, and into the abyss there poured a  white cascade of marble stairways, and widened out below into  terraces and balconies with fair white statues on them, and  descended again in a wide stairway, and came to lower terraces in  the dark, where swart uncertain shapes went to and fro.  All these  were the dreams of Gaznak, and issued from his mind, and, becoming  gleaming marble, passed over the edge of the abyss as the musicians  played.  And all the while out of the mind of Gaznak, lulled by that  strange music, went spires and pinnacles beautiful and slender, ever  ascending skywards.  And the marble dreams moved slow in time to the  music.  When the bells tolled and the musicians played their dirge,  ugly gargoyles came out suddenly all over the spires and pinnacles,  and great shadows passed swiftly down the steps and terraces, and  there was hurried whispering in the abyss.    When Leothric stepped from the black door, Gaznak opened his eyes.  He looked neither to left nor right, but stood up at once facing  Leothric.    Then the magicians played a deathspell on their strings, and there  arose a humming along the blade of Sacnoth as he turned the spell  aside.  When Leothric dropped not down, and they heard the humming of  Sacnoth, the magicians arose and fled, all wailing, as they went,  upon their strings.    Then Gaznak drew out screaming from its sheath the sword that was  the mightiest in the world except for Sacnoth, and slowly walked  towards Leothric; and he smiled as he walked, although his own  dreams had foretold his doom.  And when Leothric and Gaznak came  together, each looked at each, and neither spoke a word; but they  smote both at once, and their swords met, and each sword knew the  other and from whence he came.  And whenever the sword of Gaznak  smote on the blade of Sacnoth it rebounded gleaming, as hail from  off slated roofs; but whenever it fell upon the armour of Leothric,  it stripped it off in sheets.  And upon Gaznak's armour Sacnoth fell  oft and furiously, but ever he came back snarling, leaving no mark  behind, and as Gaznak fought he held his left hand hovering close  over his head.  Presently Leothric smote fair and fiercely at his  enemy's neck, but Gaznak, clutching his own head by the hair, lifted  it high aloft, and Sacnoth went cleaving through an empty space.  Then Gaznak replaced his head upon his neck, and all the while  fought nimbly with his sword; and again and again Leothric swept  with Sacnoth at Gaznak's bearded neck, and ever the left hand of  Gaznak was quicker than the stroke, and the head went up and the  sword rushed vainly under it.    And the ringing fight went on till Leothric's armour lay all round  him on the floor and the marble was splashed with his blood, and the  sword of Gaznak was notched like a saw from meeting the blade of  Sacnoth.  Still Gaznak stood unwounded and smiling still.    At last Leothric looked at the throat of Gaznak and aimed with  Sacnoth, and again Gaznak lifted his head by the hair; but not at  his throat flew Sacnoth, for Leothric struck instead at the lifted  hand, and through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10814"],[0,"Legends, Tales and Poems (#16)"],[1,", and p. 47, note 1).]        LA CORZA BLANCA      I    En un pequeno lugar[1] de Aragon,[1] y alla por los anos de mil  trescientos y pico, vivia retirado en su torre senorial un famoso  caballero llamado don Dionis, el cual, despues de haber servido a su  rey[3] en la guerra contra infieles, descansaba a la sazon, entregado  al alegre ejercicio de la caza, de las rudas fatigas de los combates.      [Footnote 1: un pequeno lugar. Veraton, a feudal town in the    neighborhood of the Moncayo (see p. 8, note 1). Population (1900),    484.]      [Footnote 2: Aragon. \"An ancient kingdom, now a captaincy-general of    Spain, capital Saragossa, bounded by France on the north, by    Catalonia on the east, by Valencia on the south, and by New Castile,    Old Castile, and Navarre on the west, comprising the provinces of    Huesca, Saragossa, and Teruel. It is traversed by mountains and    intersected by the Ebro. During the middle ages it was one of the    two chief Christian powers in the peninsula. In 1035 it became a    kingdom; was united to Catalonia in 1137; rose to great influence    through its acquisitions in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries    of Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and the Sicilies; and    was united with Castile in 1479 through the marriage of Ferdinand of    Aragon with Isabella of Castile.\" _Century Dict._]      [Footnote 3: The kings who reigned in Aragon during the fourteenth    century were as follows: Jaime II _el Justo_ (1291-1327), Alfonso IV    _el Benigno_ (1327-1336), Pedro IV _el Ceremonioso_ (1336-1387),    Juan I _el Cazador_ (1387-1395), and Martin (1395-1410).]    Acontecio una vez a este caballero, hallandose en su favorita  diversion acompanado de su hija, cuya belleza singular y  extraordinaria blancura le habian granjeado el sobrenombre de la  Azucena, que como se les entrase a mas andar el dia engolfados en  perseguir a una res en el monte de su feudo, tuvo que acogerse,  durante las horas de la siesta, a una canada por donde corria un  riachuelo, saltando de roca en roca con un ruido manso y agradable.    Haria[1] cosa de unas dos horas que don Dionis se encontraba en aquel  delicioso lugar, recostado sobre la menuda grama a la sombra de una  chopera, departiendo amigablemente con sus monteros sobre las  peripecias del dia, y refiriendose unos a otros las aventuras mas o  menos curiosas que en su vida de cazador les habian acontecido, cuando  por lo alto de la mas empinada ladera y a traves de los alternados  murmullos del viento que agitaba las hojas de los arboles, comenzo a  percibirse, cada vez mas cerca, el sonido de una esquililla semejante  a la del guion de un rebano.      [Footnote 1: Haria = 'it must have been.' See p. 5, note 2, and p.    42, note 1.]    En efecto, era asi, pues a poco de haberse oido la esquililla,  empezaron a saltar por entre las apinadas matas de cantueso y tomillo,  y a descender a la orilla opuesta del riachuelo, hasta unos cien  corderos, blancos como la nieve, detras de los cuales, con su caperuza  calada para libertarse la cabeza de los perpendiculares rayos del sol,  y su atillo al hombro en la punta de un palo, aparecio el zagal que  los conducia.    --A proposito de aventuras extraordinarias, exclamo al verle uno de  los monteros de don Dionis, dirigiendose a su senor: ahi teneis a  Esteban el zagal, que de algun tiempo a esta parte anda mas tonto que  lo que naturalmente lo hizo Dios, que no es poco, y el cual puede  haceros pasar un rato divertido refiriendo la causa de sus continuos  sustos.    --?Pues que le acontece a ese pobre diablo? exclamo don Dionis con  aire de curiosidad picada.    --iFriolera! anadio el montero en tono de zumba: es el caso, que sin  haber nacido en Viernes Santo[1] ni estar senalado con la cruz,[2] ni  hallarse en relaciones con el demonic, a lo que se puede colegir de  sus habitos de cristiano viejo, se encuentra sin saber como ni por  donde, dotado de la facultad mas maravillosa que ha poseido hombre  alguno, a no ser Salomon,[3] de quien se dice que sabia hasta el  lenguaje de los pajaros.      [Footnote 1: Viernes Santo = 'Good Friday,' the Friday of Holy Week,    anniversary of the death of Jesus Christ. Friday has long been    considered an unlucky day, and Good Friday, in spite of its name,    has been regarded by popular superstition as a fatal day. One born    on that day might have particular aptitude for witchcraft.]      [Footnote 2: senalado con la cruz = 'marked with the cross.' The    reference here is doubtless to a birth-mark in the form of a cross,    which would indicate a special aptitude for thaumaturgy or    occultism. This might take the form of Christian mysticism, as in    the case of St. Leo, who is said to have been \"marked all over with    red crosses\" at birth (see Brewer, _Dictionary of Miracles_, Phila.,    1884, p. 425), or the less orthodox form of magic, as is suggested    here.]      [Footnote 3: Salomon = 'Solomon.' \"A famous king of Israel, 993-953    B.C. (Duncker), son of David and Bathsheba.... The name of Solomon,    who was supposed to have possessed extraordinary magical powers,    plays an important part in Eastern and thence in European legends,\"    _Century Dict._ \"His wisdom enabled him (as legend informs us) to    interpret the speech of beasts and birds, a gift shared afterwards,    it was said, by his descendant Hillel (Koran, sura 37, Ewald,    _Gesch. Isr._, iii, 407).\" M'Clintock and Strong, _Cyclopedia of    Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature_, N.Y., 1880,    vol. ix, p. 871.]    --?Y a que se refiere esa facultad maravillosa?    --Se refiere, prosiguio el montero, a que, segun el afirma, y lo jura  y perjura por todo lo mas sagrado del mundo, los ciervos que discurren  por estos montes, se han dado de ojo para no dejarle en paz, siendo lo  mas gracioso del caso, que en mas de una ocasion les ha sorprendido  concertando entre si las burlas que han de hacerle, y despues que  estas burlas se han llevado a termino, ha oido las ruidosas carcajadas  con que las celebran.    Mientras esto decia el montero, Constanza, que asi se llamaba la  hermosa hija de don Dionis, se habia aproximado al grupo de los  cazadores, y como demostrase su curiosidad por conocer la  extraordinaria historia de Esteban, uno de estos se adelanto hasta el  sitio en donde el zagal daba de beber a su ganado, y le condujo a  presencia de su senor, que para disipar la turbacion y el visible  encogimiento del pobre mozo, se apresuro a saludarle por su nombre,  acompanando el saludo con una bondadosa sonrisa.    Era Esteban un muchacho de diecinueve a veinte anos, fornido, con la  cabeza pequena y hundida entre los hombros, los ojos pequenos y  azules, la mirada incierta y torpe como la de los albinos, la nariz  roma, los labios gruesos y entreabiertos, la frente calzada, la tez  blanca pero ennegrecida por el sol, y el cabello que le caia en parte  sobre los ojos y parte alrededor de la cara, en guedejas asperas y  rojas semejantes a las crines de un rocin colorado.    Esto, sobre poco mas o menos, era Esteban en cuanto al fisico;  respecto a su moral, podia asegurarse sin temor de ser desmentido ni  por el ni por ninguna de las personas que le conocian, que era  perfectamente simple, aunque un tanto suspicaz y malicioso como buen  rustico.    Una vez el zagal repuesto de su turbacion, le dirigio de nuevo la  palabra don Dionis, y con el tono mas serio del mundo, y fingiendo un  extraordinario interes por conocer los detalles del suceso a que su  montero se habia referido, le hizo una multitud de preguntas, a las  que Esteban comenzo a contestar de una manera evasiva, como deseando  evitar explicaciones sobre el asunto.    Estrechado, sin embargo, por las interrogaciones de su senor y por los  ruegos de Constanza, que parecia la mas curiosa e interesada en que el  pastor refiriese sus estupendas aventuras, decidiose este a hablar,  mas no sin que antes dirigiese a su alrededor una mirada de  desconfianza, como temiendo ser oido por otras personas que las que  alli estaban presentes, y de rascarse tres o cuatro veces la cabeza  tratando de reunir sus recuerdos o hilvanar su discurso, que al fin  comenzo do esta manera:    --Es el caso, senor, que segun me dijo un preste de Tarazona,[1] al  que acudi no ha mucho, para consultar mis dudas, con el diablo no  sirven juegos, sino punto en boca, buenas y muchas oraciones a San  Bartolome,[2] que es quien le conoce las cosquillas, y dejarle andar;  que Dios, que es justo y esta alla arriba, proveera a todo. Firme en  esta idea, habia decidido no volver a decir palabra sobre el asunto a  nadie, ni por nada; pero lo hare hoy por satisfacer vuestra  curiosidad, y a fe a fe que despues de todo, si el diablo me lo toma  en cuenta, y torna a molestarme en castigo de mi indiscrecion, buenos  Evangelios llevo cosidos a la pellica, y con su ayuda creo que, como  otras veces no me sera inutil el garrote.      [Footnote 1: Tarazona. A venerable town of some 8800 inhabitants    situated on the river Queiles, northeast of the Moncayo (see p. 8,    note 1) and northwest of the town of Borja.]      [Footnote 2: San Bartolome--'St. Bartholomew,' one of the twelve    apostles, deemed by some to be identical with Nathanael. \"Little is    known of his work.
