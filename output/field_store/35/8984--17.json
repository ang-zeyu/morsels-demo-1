But in ornamental art the case is entirely different. As it is to be  applied and consequently subordinated to something, and does not exist for  itself, it would be impossible, except in very rare instances, to introduce  in a design a natural object in a realistic manner and not violate some  important law of its growth or the conditions of its well-being. For  instance, to exactly repeat a certain rose, with all the accidents of its  growth, many times in a carpet is not natural. Nature never repeats  herself. Moreover, to tread on that which is supposed to suggest to us real  roses is barbarous. It would really be outraging and distorting nature  while pretending to be her faithful disciple and imitator.    We not only derive from nature the most important materials for our  designs, but also the various modes of arranging this material. Various  modes of repetition--radical, bilateral, etc.--were all probably suggested  by some natural arrangement observed in flowers, leaves, etc. Of these  different arrangements it is curious to note that the bilateral is more  characteristic of the higher forms of nature and the radiating of the  lower. The leading principles of ornament--symmetry, proportion, rhythm,  contrast, unity, variety, repose, etc.--are all exemplified in natural  forms. The latter have also suggested many of the most important  architectural forms. The Gothic cathedral, with its clustered columns  branching and forming pointed arches overhead, was probably suggested by a  grove of trees with overarching branches and boughs. The idea of the column  was derived from the papyrus plant, a species of reed growing in the river  Nile. The bud or flower suggested the capital of the column; the stalk, the  shaft; and the bulbous root, the pedestal. The blue vault of the sky  undoubtedly suggested the dome, etc.    The following are a few of the leading principles of ornamental art as set  forth by Owen Jones in his _Grammar of Ornament_, a fine work,  magnificently illustrated, whose perusal could hardly fail to delight the  most indifferent:    \"All good ornamental art should possess fitness, proportion, harmony, the  result of all which is repose.\"    \"Construction should be decorated. Decoration should never be purposely  constructed.\"    \"All ornament should be based upon geometrical construction.\"    \"Harmony of form consists in the proper balancing and contrast of the  straight, the inclined, and the curved.\"    \"In surface decoration all lines should flow out of a parent stem. Every  part, however distant, should be traced to its branch or root. Natural  law.\"    \"All junctions of curved lines with each other, or with straight lines,  should be tangential to each other. Natural law.\"    \"Natural forms, as subjects of ornament, should not be imitated, but should  be conventionalized.\"      HISTORIC ORNAMENT.    The origin of all attempts at decorating or beautifying objects lies in the  universal love of mankind for the beautiful. Once the necessaries of life  provided for, man instinctively, the world over, turns his attention toward  gratifying this feeling, by improving and decorating the forms around  him--his arms, utensils, dwelling, or his own person. The history of every  nation proves this, and no matter how rude, and even ugly, their efforts  may seem to us, we are bound to recognize in them the same motives that  actuated the builders of the Parthenon or of St. Peter's at Rome. This  awakening and gratification of the aesthetic sense seems to be the first  advance from a condition of mere animal existence, in which food, shelter,  and comfort are the only considerations, to tastes and desires that are  higher and, consequently, more impersonal.    The term historic ornament is applied to the various styles of ornamental  art which have flourished at various periods in the world's history, from  the Egyptian, dating from the 14th century B.C., to those that exist at the  present day. Their number is, consequently, almost unlimited, and we will  confine ourselves to the consideration of a few of the principal ones  only--those that have achieved the most enduring fame, or those that  exercised the most marked influence upon succeeding styles.    In considering the various styles, we must always bear in mind that, with  the exception of the Egyptian, all show very markedly the influence of the  styles that preceded them, being very often merely an outgrowth or  development of a preceding one. Thus the Greeks borrowed many forms from  the Egyptians. The Romans simply adapted and elaborated the Greek style,  etc. So that while each style is usually known by certain prominent  characteristics, it does not follow that these characteristics are peculiar  to it alone.[1] They may be found in other styles, though not to such a  great extent. While similar features will thus be seen to run through many  styles, each will usually be found to possess an individuality of its own.  Every nation, like every individual, possesses different wants and  capabilities, and will develop itself accordingly. Differences in religion,  climate, manners, customs, etc., will cause differences in their art and  literature, the most lasting monuments of their morals, taste, and  feelings.    [Footnote 1: \"Rudiments of Architecture and Building,\" through courtesy of  H.C. Baird.]    It is rather by the study of the art and literature of a people that we  arrive at a true knowledge of them than from the perusal of mere historic  facts concerning them--when they lived, who conquered them, etc.      THE STYLES.

Ancient art is also known as classic, a term which, in architecture,  sculpture, painting, and music, is almost synonymous with _good_ and  _admirable_. Taken as a whole and at its best, classic art has never been  surpassed. The designs of the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, and even the  forms of their buildings, are still copied at the present day.    The horizontal line is a marked feature of classic art. It is visible in  the leading lines of their architecture, in the frequency of horizontal  borders, friezes, etc. It accords admirably with the constructive features  of classic architecture, and thus conforms to the important decorative  principle that ornament should emphasize rather than disguise construction.    1. _Egyptian Art._--The oldest of which we have any record dates from 1800  B.C. Egyptian art is symbolic, that is to say, the forms were chosen not so  much on account of their beauty as for the purpose of conveying some  meaning. The government of Egypt being almost entirely in the hands of the  priests, these symbols were generally of a religious character, signifying  power and protection. The principal ones were: The lotus, signifying  plenty, abundance; the zigzag, symbolic of the river Nile; the winged globe  or scarabaeus, signifying protection and dominion, usually placed over doors  of houses; the fret, type of the Great Labyrinth, with its three thousand  chambers, which was, in its turn, symbolic of the life of a human soul.    The column originated with the Egyptians. It was at first heavy, broad  compared to its length, and was usually covered with hieroglyphics. The  architecture of Egypt, of which the principal forms are pyramids, sphinxes,  obelisks, and temples, is characterized by massiveness of material,  grandeur of proportion, and simplicity of parts--a style well suited to its  flat, sandy soil, though it would look heavy and out of place in a country  where nature had herself supplied the elements of grandeur and massiveness  in the form of lofty mountains or mighty forests. Egyptian art greatly  influenced all the succeeding styles, and to this time is unsurpassed in  many of its qualities.    2. _Greek Art._--The next great historic style is the Greek. Its spirit  differed entirely from the Egyptian, being aesthetic and not symbolic. Its  sole aim was to create beautiful forms, without any thought of attaching to  them a meaning. It adopted many Egyptian forms, such as the lotus, fret,  and scroll, but divested them of all symbolism or significance. The most  characteristic feature of Greek ornament is the anthemion, a  conventionalized flower form resembling our honeysuckle bud, which was  usually alternated with the lotus or lily form bud. The Greeks also  borrowed the column and flat arch from the Egyptians, but changed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#16)"],[1,"that an event  occurred which has exercised the most material influence upon my fate,  though at the time it seemed to me no more than the matter of a day.    \"I had just returned from Canada and was resting in tolerable enjoyment  of a very beautiful autumn at Lake George, when a letter reached me  from a friend then loitering in the vicinity, urging me to join him in  a certain small town in Vermont where trout streams abounded and what is  not so often the case under the circumstances, fishers were few.    \"Being in a somewhat reckless mood I at once wrote a consent, and before  another day was over, started for the remote village whence his letter  was postmarked. I found it by no means easy of access. Situated in the  midst of hills some twenty miles or so distant from any railroad, I  discovered that in order to reach it, a long ride in a stage-coach was  necessary, followed by a somewhat shorter journey on horseback. Not  being acquainted with the route, I timed my connections wrong, so that  when evening came I found myself riding over a strange road in the  darkest night I had ever known. As if this was not enough, my horse  suddenly began to limp and presently became so lame I found it  impossible to urge her beyond a slow walk. It was therefore with no  ordinary satisfaction that I presently beheld a lighted building in the  distance, which as I approached resolved itself into an inn. Stopping  in front of the house, which was closed against the chill night air,  I called out lustily for someone to take my horse, whereupon the door  opened and a man appeared on the threshold with a lantern in his hand. I  at once made my wishes known, receiving in turn a somewhat gruff,    \"'Well it is a nasty night and it will be nastier before it's over;' an  opinion instantly endorsed by a sudden swoop of wind that rushed by at  that moment, slamming the door behind him and awakening over my head a  lugubrious groaning as from the twisting boughs of some old tree, that  was almost threatening in its character.    \"'You had better go in,' said he, 'the rain will come next.'    \"I at once leaped from my horse and pushing open the door with main  strength, entered the house. Another man met me on the threshold who  merely pointing over his shoulder to a lighted room in his rear, passed  out without a word, to help the somewhat younger man, who had first  appeared, in putting up my horse. I at once accepted his silent  invitation and stepped into the room before me. Instantly I found myself  confronted by the rather startling vision of a young girl of a unique  and haunting style of beauty, who rising at my approach now stood with  her eyes on my face and her hands resting on the deal table before which  she had been sitting, in an attitude expressive of mingled surprise  and alarm. To see a woman in that place was not so strange; but such  a woman! Even in the first casual glance I gave her, I at once  acknowledged to myself her extraordinary power. Not the slightness of  her form, the palor of her countenance, or the fairness of the locks of  golden red hair that fell in two long braids over her bosom, could for  a moment counteract the effect of her dark glance or the vivid almost  unearthly force of her expression. It was as if you saw a flame  upstarting before you, waving tremulously here and there, but burning  and resistless in its white heat. I took off my hat with deference.    \"A shudder passed over her, but she made no effort to return my  acknowledgement. As we cast our eyes dilating with horror, down some  horrible pit upon whose verge we suddenly find ourselves, she allowed  her gaze for a moment to dwell upon my face, then with a sudden lifting  of her hand, pointed towards the door as if to bid me depart--when it  swung open with that shrill rushing of wind that involuntarily awakes a  shudder within you, and the two men entered and came stamping up to my  side. Instantly her hand sunk, not feebly as with fear, but calmly as if  at the bidding of her will, and without waiting for them to speak, she  turned away and quietly left the room. As the door closed upon her I  noticed that she wore a calico frock and that her face did not own one  perfect feature.    \"'Go after Luttra and tell her to make up the bed in the northwest  room,' said the elder of the two in deep gutteral tones unmistakably  German in their accent, to the other who stood shaking the wet off his  coat into the leaping flames of a small wood fire that burned on the  hearth before us.    \"'O, she'll do without my bothering,' was the sullen return. 'I'm wet  through.'    \"The elder man, a large powerfully framed fellow of some fifty years or  so, frowned. It was an evil frown, and the younger one seemed to feel  it. He immediately tossed his coat onto a chair and left the room.    \"'Boys are so obstropolous now-a-days,' remarked his companion to me  with what he evidently intended for a conciliatory nod. 'In my time they  were broke in, did what they were told and asked no questions.'    \"I smiled to myself at his calling the broad shouldered six-footer who  had just left us a boy, but merely remarking, 'He is your son is he  not!' seated myself before the blaze which shot up a tongue of white  flame at my approach, that irresistibly recalled to my fancy the  appearance of the girl who had gone out a moment before.    \"'O, yes, he is my son, and that girl you saw here was my daughter; I  keep this inn and they help me, but it is a slow way to live, I can tell  you. Travel on these roads is slim.'    \"'I should think likely,' I returned, remembering the half dozen or so  hills up which I had clambered since I took to my horse. 'How far are we  from Pentonville?'    \"'O, two or three miles,' he replied, but in a hurried kind of a way.  'Not far in the daytime but a regular journey in a night like this?'    \"'Yes,' said I, as the house shook under a fresh gust; 'it is fortunate  I have a place in which to put up.'    \"He glanced down at my baggage which consisted of a small hand bag,  an over-coat and a fishing pole, with something like a gleam of  disappointment.    \"'Going fishing?' he asked.    \"'Yes,' I returned.    \"'Good trout up those streams and plenty of them,' he went on. 'Going  alone?'    \"I did not half like his importunity, but considering I had nothing  better to do, replied as affably as possible. 'No, I expect to meet a  friend in Pentonville who will accompany me.\"    \"His hand went to his beard in a thoughtful attitude and he cast me  what, with my increased experience of the world, I should now consider a  sinister glance. 'Then you are expected?' said he.    \"Not considering this worth reply, I stretched out my feet to the blaze  and began to warm them, for I felt chilled through.    \"'Been on the road long?' he now asked, glancing at the blue flannel  suit I wore.    \"'All summer,' I returned,    \"I again thought he looked disappointed.    \"'From Troy or New York?' he went on with a vague endeavor to appear  good naturally off hand.    \"'New York.'    \"'A big place that,' he continued. 'I was there once, lots of money  stored away in them big buildings down in Wall Street, eh?'    \"I assented, and he drew a chair up to my side, a proceeding that was  interrupted, however, by the reentrance of his son, who without any  apology crowded into the other side of the fire-place in a way to  sandwich me between them. Not fancying this arrangement which I,  however, imputed to ignorance, I drew back and asked if my room was  ready. It seemed it was not, and unpleasantly as it promised, I felt  forced to reseat myself and join in, if not support, the conversation  that followed.    \"A half hour passed away, during which the wind increased till it almost  amounted to a gale. Spurts of rain dashed against the windows with a  sharp crackling sound that suggested hail, while ever and anon a distant  roll as of rousing thunder, rumbled away among the hills in a long and  reverberating peal, that made me feel glad to be housed even under the  roof of these rude and uncongenial creatures. Suddenly the conversation  turned upon the time and time-pieces, when in a low even tone I heard  murmured behind me,    \"'The gentleman's room is ready;' and turning, I saw standing in  the doorway the slight figure of the young girl whose appearance had  previously so impressed me.    \"I immediately arose. 'Then I will proceed to it at once,' said I,  taking up my traps and advancing towards her.    \"'Do not be alarmed if you hear creaks and cracklings all over the  house,' observed the landlord as I departed. 'The windows are loose and  the doors ill-fitting. In such a storm as this they make noise enough  to keep an army awake. The house is safe enough though and if you don't  mind noise--'    \"'O I don't mind noise,' rejoined I, feeling at that moment tired enough  to fall into a doze on the staircase. 'I shall sleep, never fear,' and  without further ado followed the girl upstairs into a large clumsily  furnished room whose enormous bed draped with heavy curtains at once  attracted my attention.    \"'O I cannot sleep under those things,' remarked I, with a gesture  towards the dismal draperies which to me were another name for  suffocation.    \"With a single arm-sweep she threw them back. 'Is there anything more I  can do for you?' asked she, glancing hastily about the room.    \"I thanked her and said 'no,' at which she at once departed with a look  of still determination upon her countenance that I found it hard to  explain.    \"Left alone in that large, bare and dimly lighted room, with the wind  shrieking in the chimney and the powerful limbs of some huge tree  beating against the walls without, with a heavy thud inexpressibly  mournful, I found to my surprise and something like dismay, that the  sleepiness which had hitherto oppressed me, had in some unaccountable  way entirely fled. In vain I contemplated the bed, comfortable "]]]
