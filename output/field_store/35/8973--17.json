I was spending a right happy afternoon in a house where I had  established peace, and then I heard that a birthday was being kept here.  Now this is what I call selfish, after all, said I to myself: you will  only enjoy yourself with those whose broken peace you have mended. Why  cannot you for once go and be happy with friends who keep the peace for  themselves? No sooner said than done. Here I am, as I determined with  myself that I would be.\"    \"Yesterday you would have met a large party here; today you will find  but a small one,\" said Charlotte; \"you will meet the Count and the  Baroness, with whom you have had enough to do already, I believe.\"    Out of the middle of the party, who had all four come down to welcome  him, the strange man dashed in the keenest disgust, seizing at the same  time his hat and whip. \"Some unlucky star is always over me,\" he cried,  \"directly I try to rest and enjoy myself. What business have I going out  of my proper character? I ought never to have come, and now I am  persecuted away. Under one roof with those two I will not remain, and  you take care of yourselves. They bring nothing but mischief; their  nature is like leaven, and propagates its own contagion.\"    They tried to pacify him, but it was in vain. \"Whoever strikes at  marriage,\" he cried;--\"whoever, either by word or act, undermines this,  the foundation of all moral society, that man has to settle with me, and  if I cannot become his master, I take care to settle myself out of his  way. Marriage is the beginning and the end of all culture. It makes the  savage mild; and the most cultivated has no better opportunity for  displaying his gentleness. Indissoluble it must be, because it brings so  much happiness that what small exceptional unhappiness it may bring  counts for nothing in the balance. And what do men mean by talking of  unhappiness? Impatience it is which from time to time comes over them,  and then they fancy themselves unhappy. Let them wait till the moment is  gone by, and then they will bless their good fortune that what has stood  so long continues standing. There never can be any adequate ground for  separation. The condition of man is pitched so high, in its joys and in  its sorrows, that the sum which two married people owe to each other  defies calculation. It is an infinite debt, which can only be discharged  through all eternity.    \"Its annoyances marriage may often have; I can well believe that, and it  is as it should be. We are all married to our consciences, and there are  times when we should be glad to be divorced from them; mine gives me  more annoyance than ever a man or a woman can give.\"    All this he poured out with the greatest vehemence: he would very likely  have gone on speaking longer, had not the sound of the postilions'  horns given notice of the arrival of the visitors, who, as if on a  concerted arrangement, drove into the castle-court from opposite sides  at the same moment. Mittler slipped away as their host hastened to  receive them, and desiring that his horse might be brought out  immediately, rode angrily off.          CHAPTER X      The visitors were welcomed and brought in. They were delighted to find  themselves again in the same house and in the same rooms where in early  times they had passed many happy days, but which they had not seen for a  long time. Their friends too were very glad to see them. The Count and  the Baroness had both those tall fine figures which please in middle  life almost better than in youth. If something of the first bloom had  faded off them, yet there was an air in their appearance which was  always irresistibly attractive. Their manners too were thoroughly  charming. Their free way of taking hold of life and dealing with it,  their happy humor, and apparent easy unembarrassment, communicated  itself at once to the rest; and a lighter atmosphere hung about the  whole party, without their having observed it stealing on them.    The effect made itself felt immediately on the entrance of the  new-comers. They were fresh from the fashionable world, as was to be  seen at once, in their dress, in their equipment, and in everything  about them; and they formed a contrast not a little striking with our  friends, their country style, and the vehement feelings which were at  work underneath among them. This, however, very soon disappeared in the  stream of past recollection and present interests, and a rapid, lively  conversation soon united them all. After a short time they again  separated. The ladies withdrew to their own apartments, and there found  amusement enough in the many things which they had to tell one another,  and in setting to work at the same time to examine the new fashions, the  spring dresses, bonnets, and such like; while the gentlemen were  employing themselves looking at the new traveling chariots, trotting out  the horses, and beginning at once to bargain and exchange.    They did not meet again till dinner; in the meantime they had changed  their dress. And here, too, the newly arrived pair showed to all  advantage. Everything they wore was new, and in a style which their  friends at the castle had never seen, and yet, being accustomed to it  themselves, it appeared perfectly natural and graceful.    The conversation was brilliant and well sustained, as, indeed, in the  company of such persons everything and nothing appears to interest. They  spoke in French that the attendants might not understand what they said,  and swept in happiest humor over all that was passing in the great or  the middle world. On one particular subject they remained, however,  longer than was desirable. It was occasioned by Charlotte asking after  one of her early friends, of whom she had to learn, with some distress,  that she was on the point of being separated from her husband.    \"It is a melancholy thing,\" Charlotte said, \"when we fancy our absent  friends are finally settled, when we believe persons very dear to us to  be provided for for life, suddenly to hear that their fortunes are cast  loose once more; that they have to strike into a fresh path of life, and  very likely a most insecure one.\"    \"Indeed, my dear friend,\" the Count answered, \"it is our own fault if we  allow ourselves to be surprised at such things. We please ourselves with  imagining matters of this earth, and particularly matrimonial  connections, as very enduring; and as concerns this last point, the  plays which we see over and over again help to mislead us; being, as  they are, so untrue to the course of the world. In a comedy we see a  marriage as the last aim of a desire which is hindered and crossed  through a number of acts, and at the instant when it is reached the  curtain falls, and the momentary satisfaction continues to ring on in  our ears. But in the world it is very different. The play goes on still  behind the scenes, and when the curtain rises again we may see and hear,  perhaps, little enough of the marriage.\"    \"It cannot be so very bad, however,\" said Charlotte, smiling. \"We see  people who have gone off the boards of the theatre, ready enough to  undertake a part upon them again.\"    \"There is nothing to say against that,\" said the Count. \"In a new  character a man may readily venture on a second trial; and when we know  the world we see clearly that it is only this positive, eternal duration  of marriage in a world where everything is in motion, which has anything  unbecoming about it. A certain friend of mine, whose humor displays  itself principally in suggestions for new laws, maintained that every  marriage should be concluded only for five years. Five, he said, was a  sacred number--pretty and uneven. Such a period would be long enough for  people to learn each other's character, bring a child or two into the  world, quarrel, separate, and what is best, get reconciled again. He  would often exclaim, 'How happily the first part of the time would pass  away!' Two or three years, at least, would be perfect bliss. On one side  or the other there would not fail to be a wish to have the relation  continue longer, and the amiability would increase the nearer they got  to the parting time. The indifferent, even the dissatisfied party, would  be softened and gained over by such behavior; they would forget, as in  pleasant company the hours pass always unobserved, how the time went by,  and they would be delightfully surprised when, after the term had run  out, they first observed that they had unknowingly prolonged it.\"    Charming and pleasant as all this sounded, and deep (Charlotte felt it  to her soul) as was the moral significance which lay below it,  expressions of this kind, on Ottilie's account, were most distasteful to  her. She knew very well that nothing was more dangerous than the  licentious conversation which treats culpable or semi-culpable actions  as if they were common, ordinary, and even laudable, and of such  undesirable kind assuredly were all which touched on the sacredness of  marriage. She endeavored, therefore, in her skilful way, to give the  conversation another turn, and, when she found that she could not, it  vexed her that Ottilie had managed everything so well that there was no  occasion for her to leave the table. In her quiet observant way a nod or  a look was enough for her to signify to the head servant whatever was to  be done, and everything went off perfectly, although there were a couple  of strange men in livery in the way who were rather a trouble than a  convenience. And so the Count, without feeling Charlotte's hints, went  on giving his opinions on the same subject. Generally, he was little  enough apt to be"]]]
