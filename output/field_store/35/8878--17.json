Chapter VIII                             \"OLD\" BILIBID PRISON        Our trucks entered the main gate of Bilibid, where we dismounted and  walked to a large stone building in the back of the old prison. I was  assigned an area two by six feet in the middle of the hall on the  second floor. My bed was a blanket on the concrete floor. The windows  were all boarded-up.    We were greeted by other prisoners: \"American planes have been making  daily bombing raids on the port area only a few blocks away and on the  ships in the harbor - Manila Bay.\" We thought, \"That's good! Maybe  they won't be able to get    us out.\"    \"MacArthur must be getting close! When the air-raid alarms sounded,  the guards have been chasing all of the prisoners inside the  buildings.\"    \"We were able to find peepholes where we could watch the U.S. planes  dive down through heavy flak of anti-aircraft guns, to drop their  bombs on important targets.\"    It was not long until we had a front seat to a bombing raid.    We watched black smoke billowing up from burning oil tanks really a  great show! It was also quickly evident that slow starvation was the  daily pattern at Bilibid. The high walls made it impossible to get any  extra food. My weight was now 110 pounds.    In November, I developed dengue, a mosquito-born disease called  \"break-bone fever.\" It was properly named-felt .like every bone in my  body was breaking. For ten days I was in the prison hospital,  overlooking the main gate and Rizal Ave. I didn't care much whether I  lived or died - one chill after another. No appetite! I couldn't eat  the thin lugao they brought me. Lost weight and strength. I was in bad  shape to start a trip through MacArthur's blockade.    About December 1st, I was pronounced well! I dragged myself back to  the big stone building and my area on the concrete floor. My bones  were getting very close to the concrete.    Shortly, a typhoon arrived; the winds blew, the skies darkened and  heavy rains beat down-generally very unpleasant. No planes arrived to  make their daily attacks.    In a few days, we began to hear ships' whistles and bells again. That  meant ships were moving in and out of Manila Bay, unmolested by bad  weather and U.S. planes. This was a bad omen! The Japs would probably  get us aboard a ship and on our way through MacArthur's blockade.    Again, the Japanese ordered our medical officers to examine all  prisoners in Bilibid, to determine those healthy enough to complete  the trip to Japan, and those sick enough to remain behind the stone  walls-to be recaptured by MacArthur's troops in a few weeks. My better  sense told me it would be smarter to be sick and be rescued, but my  conscience kept telling me I should go along.       Liberation of Bilibid Prison: MacArthur's invading forces landed on  the beaches of Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, 1945, with the aid of  Col. Russell Volkmann's Northern Luzon guerrillas Headquarters were  established in Dagupan.    On February 4th, a flying column of the 1st Cav. Div. Under Brig. Gen.  William Chase entered Manila and relieved the prisoners from Bilibid.  As a soldier broke down a boarded-up window in the stone wall near  where Ted Winship was busy quanning (cooking), Ted asked, \"Who are  you?\"       The soldier answered, \"I'm Sgt. Jones! We've come to liberate you!\"       Ted countered with: \"Where the hell have you been for three years?\"          Chapter IX JAPAN DETAIL - ORIENTAL TOUR STRICTLY THIRD-CLASS!      In the fall of 1944, when MacArthur's forces were threatening to  retake the Philippines, the Japanese began to evacuate all healthy  prisoners of war to Japan, so that none could be liberated to assist  the invading army. The death of a prisoner by any means was considered  preferable to capture by the invading troops Japanese thinking).    \"Hell Ships\": The \"hell ship\" journey began at old Bilibid Prison.    December 13, 1944: Long before dawn, we were awakened by the ringing  of a large bell at the prison guardhouse. The day we had been dreading  for many months, had arrived; 1619 of us would depart from our  uncomfortable quarters and start a long journey to Japan. Thoughts of  riding on a prison ship filled us with apprehension; several prison  ships had already been sunk and many of our friends had been lost.    We lifted our emaciated bodies from the concrete floor, showered and  shaved in the dark; we didn't know when we might experience such  luxury again. We put our few worldly but worthless possessions into  our packs. Breakfast was the usual half-cup of lugao.    As the first light of day peeked over the high stone wall, we were  lined up with our baggage; we stood for hours as Col. Beecher, USMC,  our commanding officer, and a Japanese guard wandered through our  ranks-trying to get a head count. The guards, a rather ignorant group,  were completely puzzled by such a large number - 1619. Finally about  0800 hours, everything    seemed to be ready. Shouting and waving disabled prisoners filled the  windows and doors as our long line moved slowly through the gate and  dawn Rizal Avenue. When the line was about was quickly reversed and  hurried back into the prison: \"Kura! Hully, Hully! Speeda! Speeda!\"    We couldn't see any planes, but were kept in line far hours. Sweat  rolled freely dawn our faces and backs. Guards went among us, picking  up mosquito nets and tropical helmets: \"Don't need in Japan!\"    At 1100 hours, the long line moved slowly out the gate. Rizal Avenue  was crowded with saber, gaping Filipinas not the, happy-go-lucky ones  we had known before the war. Occasionally when hidden from guards,  they would give us a \"V\" sign. We dared not acknowledge it.    We could see \"pity\" on their faces as we passed dawn the streets, by  the Metropolitan Theater and over the Passig Bridge. The natives'  looked haggard and ragged. Most of them were on foot rather than  riding the usual caratellas or caramettas (pony carts). Many stores  were closed, boarded-up. Many homes showed signs of looting. Metal had  been removed from every available place-iron bars from windows,  manhole covers from streets taken to Japan far making armaments.    We went the long way through Luneta Park; we saw artillery and  anti-aircraft positions there and in the streets. It appeared that the  Nips would put up a good fight to retain the Philippines.    There were many ships in the bay-destroyers and cruisers as well as  transports. Same had been sunk; many were nearly submerged or listing  badly; yet others appeared to be unharmed.    Tugs and tenders moved briskly about the bay; derricks strained aver  damaged vessels. All in all, there was entirely too much activity far  a supposedly blockaded port!    There were many Japanese civilians, mostly women and children, milling  about Pier Seven. They were short and stocky, dark and expressionless.  Most of them were carrying cloth or straw bundles-their possessions.  They were being evacuated to Japan to avoid the battle far the  Philippines that everyone knew was coming.    As we arrived on the pier, we were divided into groups of one hundred  and ordered to \"Sit dawn and stay in place!\" The floor was filthy, but  the rest was welcome.    Oryoko Maru: By squirming around, I could read the name of    the ship, Oryoku Maru, on the bow painted over with gray as was the  whole ship. There was nothing to mark it as a ship carrying prisoners.  Winches were working rapidly, raising American-made appliances and  cars to the deck.    I discovered a water faucet nearby and eased over to it to fill my  canteen, only to be driven away by a jabbering guard. I was not  enthused about making a trip through MacArthur's blockade with an  empty canteen. However, I did get a good look at the ship. It was a  large, modern passenger liner with several big anti-aircraft guns on  the deck. The ship was not to be sunk without a good fight.    Pier Seven showed much evidence of heavy bombing, but was still  definitely usable. Just before dark, prisoners began to climb the  ladders to the deck. The aft hold was loaded first 719 prisoners.  Next, the forward hold with 718 prisoners.    Just as we, the remaining 182 prisoners were ordered into the second  hold (behind the forward hold), we were joined by seven additional  prisoners who had come from Fort McKinley, a few miles east of Manila.  Many others were on the way to join us, when their lead streetcar  conveniently left the tracks.    Our group, now 189, was composed mostly of medics and civilians. The  ship's cabins, dining rooms and parlors were crowded with several  thousand women, children and elderly Japanese civilians. We dropped  our packs into the hold and quickly descended the long ladder into  darkness hurried by the grunting guards and their \"vitamin sticks.\"    There was not enough room for everyone to sit down. Our group of  medics crowded together in the center of the hold. The floor was  filthy, covered with horse manure. The stench burned our eyes; our  roof was the darkening sky. We were glad for its protection. The ship  was soon under way, moving smoothly and rapidly.    We were divided into groups of twenty. A representative of each group  was sent above to get small amounts of fish, rice and water. Our  latrine was a five-gallon can in the center of the hold; it was soon  filled.    Sleeping was difficult; we were awakened each time a neighbor would  move, because of cramps, numbed extremities or the urge to urinate.    December 14, 1945: Thursday - We were awakened at the first sign of  daylight. Three of us who had shared an interest in      a can of Spam saved for several weeks from a Red Cross package-debated  whether or not to eat it. We decided to save it for a suitable  emergency.    Our group representative went above to the kitchen for a bucket of  rice; he brought back bad news from the other holds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#15)"],[1,"talking about it now to dress  for dinner!

The Amsterdam International Exhibition, the opening of which has been  fixed for May 1, 1883, is now in way of realization. This exhibition  will present a special interest to all nations, and particularly to  their export trade. Holland, which is one of the great colonial powers,  proposes by means of this affair to organize a competition between the  various colonizing nations, and to contribute thus to a knowledge of  the resources of foreign countries whose richness of soil is their  fundamental power.    The executive committee includes the names of some of the most prominent  persons of the Netherlands: M. Cordes, president; M. de Clercq,  delegate; M. Kappeyne van di Coppello, secretary; and M. Agostini,  commissary general.    [Illustration: PLAN OF THE DUTCH INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.       1. Exhibition Palace.     2. Netherlands Colonial Exhibition.     3. Fine Arts.     4.

A Retrospective  exhibition of Fine Arts and of Arts applied to the Industries. 4.  Special exhibitions. 5. Lectures and Scientific Reunions.    The colonial part forms the base of the exhibition, and will be devoted  to a comparative study of the different systems of colonization  and colonial agriculture, as well as of the manners and customs of  ultramarine peoples. In giving an exact idea of what has been done, it  will indicate what remains to be done from the standpoint of a general  development of commerce and manufactures. Such is the programme of the  first division.    The second division will include everything that relates to the export  trade.    The third division will be reserved for works of art dating back from  the most remote ages.    The fourth division will be devoted to temporary exhibitions, such as  those of horticultural and agricultural products, etc.    The fifth division will constitute the intellectual part, so to speak,  of the exhibition. It will be devoted to lectures, and to scientific  meetings for the discussion of questions relating to teaching, to the  arts, to the sciences, to hygiene, to international jurisprudence, and  to political economy. Questions of colonial economy will naturally  occupy the first rank.    As will be seen, the programme of this grand scheme organized by the  Netherlands government is a broad one; and, owing the experience  acquired in recent universal exhibitions, especially that of Paris in  1878, very happy results may be expected from it.    At present, we give an illustration showing the general plan of the  exhibition. In future, in measure as the work proceeds, we shall be able  to give further details.--_Le Genie Civil_.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW METHOD OF DETECTING DYES ON YARNS AND TISSUES.    By JULES JOFFRE.      The reagents employed are a solution of caustic potassa in ten parts  of water; hydrochloric acid diluted with an equal bulk of water, or  occasionally concentrated; nitric acid, ammonia, ferric sulphate, and  a concentrated solution of tin crystals. The most convenient method of  operating is to steep small portions of the cloth under examination in a  little of the reagent placed at the bottom of a porcelain capsule. The  bits are then laid on the edge of the capsule, when the changes of color  which they have undergone may be conveniently observed. It is useful to  submit to the same reagents simultaneously portions of cloth dyed in a  known manner with the wares which are suspected of having been used in  dyeing the goods under examination.      RED COLORS.    By the action of caustic potassa, the reds are divided into four groups:  1, those which turn to a violet or blue; 2, those which turn brown;  3, those which are changed to a light yellow or gray; 4, those which  undergo little or no change.    The first group comprises madder, cochineal, orchil, alkanet, and  murexide. Madder reds are turned to an orange by hydrochloric acid,  while the three next are not notably affected. Cochineal is turned by  the potassa to a violet-red, orchil to a violet-blue, and alkanet to a  decided blue. Lac-dye presents the same reactions as cochineal, but  has less brightness. Ammoniacal cochineal and carmine may likewise be  distinguished by the tone of the reds obtained.    A characteristic of madder reds is that, after having been turned yellow  by hydrochloric acid, they are rendered violet on treatment with milk  of lime. A boiling soap-lye restores the original red, though somewhat  paler. Artificial alizarine gives the same reaction. Turkey-reds,  however, are quite unaffected by acid. Garancine and garanceux reds, if  treated first with hydrochloric acid and then with milk of lime, turn to  a dull blue.    Madder dyes are sometimes slow in being turned to a violet by potassa,  and this shade when produced is often brownish. They might thus be  confounded with the dyes of the fourth group, i.e., rosolic acid,  coralline, eosine, and coccine. None of these colors gives the  characteristic reaction with milk of lime and boiling soap-lye. If  plunged in milk of lime, they resume their rose or orange shades, while  the madder colors become violet. Murexide is turned, by potassa, gray  in its light shades and violet in its dark ones. It might, then, be  confounded with orchil, but it is decolorized by hydrochloric acid,  which leaves orchil a red. Moreover, it is turned greenish by stannous  chloride.    A special character of this dye (murexide) is the presence of mercury,  the salts of which serve as mordants for fixing it, and may be detected  by the ordinary reagents.    The second group comprises merely sandal wood or sanders red, which  turns to a brown. On boiling it with copperas it becomes violet, while  on boiling with potassium dichromate it changes to a yellowish brown.    The third group includes safflower, magenta, and murexide (light  shades). If the action of the potassa is prolonged the (soft) red woods  enter into this group. Safflower turns yellow by the action of potassa,  and the original rose shade is not restored by washing with water.  Hydrochloric acid turns it immediately yellow. Citric acid has no  action. Magenta is completely decolorized by potassa, but a prolonged  washing in water reproduces the original shade. This reaction is common  to many aniline colors. These decolorations and recolorations are easily  produced in dark shades, while in very light shades they are less easily  observed, because there is always a certain loss of color. Stannous  chloride turns magenta reds to a violet. Hydrochloric acid renders them  yellowish brown (afterward greenish?). Water restores the purple red  shade.    The fourth group comprises saffranine, azo-dinaphthyldiamine, rosolic  acid, coralline, pure eosine and cosine modified by a salt of lead,  coccina, artificial ponceau, and red-wood.    Saffranine is detected by the action of hydrochloric acid, which turns  it to a beautiful blue; the red color is restored by washing in water.  Azo-dinaphthyl diamine is recognized by its peculiar orange cast, and is  turned by hydrochloric acid to a dull, dirty violet. Rosolic acid and  coralline, as well as eosine, are turned by hydrochloric acid to an  orange-yellow: the two former are distinguished from eosine by their  shade, which inclines to a yellow. Potassa turns rosolic acid and  coralline from an orange-red to a bright red, while it produces no  change in eosine. If the action of potassa is prolonged, modified eosine  is blackened in consequence of the decomposition of the wool, the  sulphur of which forms lead sulphide. Coccine becomes of a light  lemon-yellow on treatment with hydrochloric acid. Washing with water  restores the original shade. It affords the same reactions as eosine,  but its tone is more inclined to an orange.    Artificial ponceau does not undergo any change on treatment with  hydrochloric acid, and resists potash. Red wood shades are turned toward  a gooseberry-red by hydrochloric acid, especially if strong. This last  reaction not being very distinct, red-wood shades might be mistaken  for those of artificial ponceau but for the superior brightness of the  latter. If the action of potassa is prolonged, the red-wood shades  are decolorized, and a washing with water then bleaches the tissue.  Rocelline affords the same reactions as artificial ponceau, but if  steeped in a concentrated solution of stannous chloride it is in time  completely discharged, which is not the case with artificial ponceau.      VIOLET COLORS.    Violets are divided into two groups: those affected by potassa, and  those upon which it has no action. The first group embraces logwood,  orchil, alkanet, and aniline violets, including under the latter term  Perkin's violet, (probably the original \"mauve\"), dahlia, Parme or  magenta violet, methyl, and Hofmann's violets. The action of potassa  gives indications for each of these violets. Logwood violet is browned;  that of orchil, if slightly reddish, is turned to a blue-violet; that of  alkanet is modified to a fine blue. Lastly, Perkin's mauve, dahlia, and  methyl violet become of a grayish brown, which may "]]]
