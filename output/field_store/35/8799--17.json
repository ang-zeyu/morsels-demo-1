For good springs from one selfsame  source, but evil arises in many ways, as Dionysius informs us.  Wherefore to make amends for our iniquities, by which we acknowledge  ourselves to have frequently offended the Creator of all things, in  asking the assistance of their prayers, we have thought fit to exhort  our future students to show their gratitude as well to us as to their  other benefactors in time to come by requiting our forethought for  their benefit by spiritual retribution.  Let us live when dead in their  memories, who have lived in our benevolence before they were born, and  live now sustained by our beneficence.  Let them implore the mercy of  the Redeemer with unwearied prayer, that the pious Judge may excuse our  negligences, may pardon the wickedness of our sins, may cover the  lapses of our feebleness with the cloak of piety, and remit by His  divine goodness the offences of which we are ashamed and penitent.  That He may preserve to us for a due season of repentance the gifts of  His good grace, steadfastness of faith, loftiness of hope, and the  widest charity to all men.  That He may turn our haughty will to lament  its faults, that it may deplore its past most vain elations, may  retract its most bitter indignations, and detest its most insane  delectations.  That His virtue may abound in us, when our own is found  wanting, and that He who freely consecrated our beginning by the  sacrament of baptism, and advanced our progress to the seat of the  Apostles without any desert of ours, may deign to fortify our outgoing  by the fitting sacraments.  That we may be delivered from the lust of  the flesh, that the fear of death may utterly vanish and our spirit may  desire to be dissolved and be with Christ, and existing upon earth in  body only, in thought and longing our conversation may be in Heaven.  That the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation may  graciously come to meet the prodigal returning from the husks; that He  may receive the piece of silver that has been lately found and transmit  it by His holy angels into His eternal treasury.  That He may rebuke  with His terrible countenance, at the hour of our departure, the  spirits of darkness, lest Leviathan, that old serpent, lying hid at the  gate of death, should spread unforeseen snares for our feet.  But when  we shall be summoned to the awful judgment-seat to give an account on  the testimony of conscience of all things we have done in the body, the  God-Man may consider the price of the holy blood that He has shed, and  that the Incarnate Deity may note the frame of our carnal nature, that  our weakness may pass unpunished where infinite loving-kindness is to  be found, and that the soul of the wretched sinner may breathe again  where the peculiar office of the Judge is to show mercy.  And further,  let our students be always diligent in invoking the refuge of our hope  after God, the Virgin Mother of God and Blessed Queen of Heaven, that  we who for our manifold sins and wickednesses have deserved the anger  of the Judge, by the aid of her ever-acceptable supplications may merit  His forgiveness; that her pious hand may depress the scale of the  balance in which our small and few good deeds shall be weighed, lest  the heaviness of our sins preponderate and cast us down to the  bottomless pit of perdition.  Moreover, let them ever venerate with due  observance the most deserving Confessor Cuthbert, the care of whose  flock we have unworthily undertaken, ever devoutly praying that he may  deign to excuse by his prayers his all-unworthy vicar, and may procure  him whom he hath admitted as his successor upon earth to be made his  assessor in Heaven.  Finally, let them pray God with holy prayers as  well of body as of soul, that He will restore the spirit created in the  image of the Trinity, after its sojourn in this miserable world, to its  primordial prototype, and grant to it for ever to enjoy the sight of  His countenance: through our Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.

With these Dicky set forth for El Medineh in the Fayoum, where his  important business lay. As he cantered away from El Wasta, out through  the green valley and on into the desert where stands the Pyramid of  Maydoum, he turned his business over and over in his mind, that he  might study it from a hundred sides. For miles he did not see a human  being--only a caravan of camels in the distance, some vultures overhead  and the smoke of the train behind him by the great river. Suddenly,  however, as he cantered over the crest of a hill, he saw in the  desert-trail before him a foot-traveller, who turned round hastily,  almost nervously, at the sound of his horse's feet.    It was the figure of a slim, handsome youth, perhaps twenty, perhaps  thirty. The face was clean-shaven, and though the body seemed young and  the face was unlined, the eyes were terribly old. Pathos and fanaticism  were in the look, so Dicky Donovan thought. He judged the young Arab to  be one of the holy men who live by the gifts of the people, and who do  strange acts of devotion; such as sitting in one place for twenty years,  or going without clothes, or chanting the Koran ten hours a day, or  cutting themselves with knives. But this young man was clothed in the  plain blue calico of the fellah, and on his head was a coarse brown fez  of raw wool. Yet round the brown fez was a green cloth, which may only  be worn by one who has been a pilgrimage to Mecca.    \"Nehar-ak koom said--God be with you!\" said Dicky in Arabic.    \"Nehar-ak said, efendi--God prosper thy greatness!\" was the reply, in a  voice as full as a man's, but as soft as a woman's--an unusual thing in  an Arab. \"Have you travelled far?\" asked Dicky.    \"From the Pyramid of Maydoum, effendi,\" was the quiet reply.    Dicky laughed. \"A poor tavern; cold sleeping there, Mahommed.\"    \"The breath of Allah is warm,\" answered the Arab. Dicky liked the lad's  answer. Putting a hand in his saddle-bag, he drew out a cake of dourha  bread and some onions--for he made shift to live as the people lived,  lest he should be caught unawares some time, and die of the remembrance  of too much luxury in the midst of frugal fare.    \"Plenty be in your home, Mahommed!\" he said, and held out the bread and  onions.    The slim hands came up at once and took the food, the eyes flashed a  strange look at Dicky. \"God give you plenty upon your plenty, effendi,  and save your soul and the souls of your wife and children, if it be  your will, effendi!\"    \"I have no wife, praise be to God,\" said Dicky; \"but if I had, her soul  would be saved before my own, or I'm a dervish!\" Then something moved  him further, and he unbuttoned his pocket--for there really was a button  to Dicky's pocket. He drew out a five-piastre piece, and held it down to  the young Arab. \"For the home-coming after Mecca,\" he said, and smiled.    The young Arab drew back. \"I will eat thy bread, but no more, effendi,\"  he said quickly.    \"Then you're not what I thought you were,\" said Dicky under his breath,  and, with a quick good-bye, struck a heel into the horse's side and  galloped away toward El Medineh.    In El Medineh Dicky went about his business--a bitter business it was,  as all Egypt came to know. For four days he pursued it, without halting  and in some danger, for, disguise himself as he would in his frequenting  of the cafes, his Arabic was not yet wholly perfect. Sometimes he went  about in European dress, and that was equally dangerous, for in those  days the Fayoum was a nest of brigandage and murder, and an European--an  infidel dog--was fair game.    But Dicky had two friends--the village barber, and the moghassil of the  dead, or body-washer, who were in his pay; and for the moment they  were loyal to him. For his purpose, too, they were the most useful of  mercenaries: for the duties of a barber are those of a valet-de-chambre,  a doctor, registrar and sanitary officer combined; and his coadjutor in  information and gossip was the moghassil, who sits and waits for some  one to die, as a raven on a housetop waits for carrion. Dicky was  patient, but as the days went by and nothing came of all his searching,  his lips tightened and his eyes became more restless. One day, as he  sat in his doorway twisting and turning things in his mind, with an ugly  knot in his temper, the barber came to him quickly.    \"Saadat el basha, I have found the Englishwoman, by the mercy of Allah!\"    Dicky looked at Achmed Hariri for a moment without stirring or speaking;  his lips relaxed, his eyes softening with satisfaction.    \"She is living?\"    \"But living, saadat el basha.\"    Dicky started to his feet. \"At the mudirieh?\"    \"At the house of Azra, the seller of sherbet, saadat el basha.\"    \"When did she leave the mudirieh?\"    \"A week past, effendi.\"    \"Why did she leave?\"    \"None knows save the sister of Azra, who is in the harem. The  Englishwoman was kind to her when she was ill, and she gave her aid.\"    \"The Mudir has not tried to find her?\"    \"Will the robber make a noise if the horse he has stolen breaks free,  effendi?\"    \"Why has she not flown the place?\"    \"Effendi, can the broken-winged bird fly!\"    \"She is ill?\" He caught the barber by the arm.    \"As a gazelle with an arrow in its breast.\"    Dicky's small hand tightened like a vice on the barber's thin arm. \"And  he who sped the arrow, Achmed Hariri?\"    Achmed Hariri was silent.    \"Shall he not die the death?\"    Achmed Hariri shrank back.    Dicky drew from his pocket a paper with seals, and held it up to the  barber's eyes. The barber stared, drew back, salaamed, bowed his head,  and put a hand upon his turban as a slave to his master.    \"Show me the way, Mahommed,\" said Dicky, and stepped out.    Two hours later Dicky, with pale face, and fingers clutching his heavy  riding-whip fiercely, came quickly towards the bridge where he must  cross to go to the mudirieh. Suddenly he heard an uproar, and saw men  hurrying on in front of him. He quickened his footsteps, and presently  came to a house on which had been freshly painted those rough, staring  pictures of \"accidents by flood and field,\" which Mecca pilgrims paint  on their houses like hatchments, on their safe return--proclamation of  their prestige.    Presently he saw in the grasp of an infuriated crowd the Arab youth  he had met in the desert, near the Pyramid of Maydoum. Execrations,  murderous cries arose from the mob. The youth's face was deathly pale,  but it had no fear. Upon the outskirts of the crowd hung women, their  robes drawn half over their faces, crying out for the young man's death.  Dicky asked the ghaflir standing by what the youth had done.    \"It is no youth, but a woman,\" he answered--\"the latest wife of the  Mudir. In a man's clothes--\"    He paused, for the head sheikh of El Medineh, with two Ulema, entered  the throng. The crowd fell back. Presently the Sheikh-el-beled mounted  the mastaba by the house, the holy men beside him, and pointing to the  Arab youth, spoke loudly:    \"This sister of scorpions and crocodiles has earned a thousand deaths.  She was a daughter of a pasha, and was lifted high. She was made the  wife of Abbas Bey, our Mudir. Like a wanton beast she cut off her hair,  clothed herself as a man, journeyed to Mecca, and desecrated the tomb  of Mahomet, who hath written that no woman, save her husband of his  goodness bring her, shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\"    He paused, and pointed to the rough pictures on the walls. \"This  morning, dressed as a man, she went in secret to the sacred purple  pillar for barren women in the Mosque of Amrar, by the Bahr-el-Yusef,  and was found there with her tongue to it. What shall be done to this  accursed tree in the garden of Mahomet?\"    \"Cut it down!\" shouted the crowd; and the Ulema standing beside the  Sheikh-el-beled said: \"Cut down for ever the accursed tree.\"    \"To-morrow, at sunrise, she shall die as a blasphemer, this daughter of  Sheitan the Evil One,\" continued the holy men.    \"What saith the Mudir?\" cried a tax-gatherer. \"The Mudir himself shall  see her die at sunrise,\" answered the chief of the Ulema.    Shouts of hideous joy went up. At that moment the woman's eyes met  Dicky's, and they suddenly lighted. Dicky picked his way through the  crowd, and stood before the Sheikh-el-beled. With an Arab salute, he  said:    \"I am, as you know, my brother, a friend of our master the Khedive, and  I carry his ring on my finger.\" The Sheikh-el-beled salaamed as Dicky  held up his hand, and a murmur ran through the crowd. \"What you have  done to the woman is well done, and according to your law she should  die. But will ye not let her tell her story, so it may be written down,  that when perchance evil voices carry the tale to the Khedive he shall  have her own words for her condemnation?\"    The Ulema looked at the Sheikh-el-beled, and he made answer: \"It is well  said; let the woman speak, and her words be written down.\"    \"Is it meet that all should hear?\" asked Dicky, for he saw the look in  the woman's eyes. \"Will she not speak more freely if we be few?\"    \"Let her be taken into the house,\" said the Sheikhel-beled. Turning to  the holy men, he added: \"Ye and the Inglesi shall hear.\"    When they were within the house, the woman was brought in and stood  before them.    \"Speak,\" said the Sheikh-el-beled to her roughly. She kept her eyes  fixed on Dicky as she spoke: \"For the thing I have done I shall answer.  I had no joy in the harem. I gave no child to my lord, though often I  put my tongue to the sacred pillar of porphyry in the Mosque of Amrar.  My lord's love went from me. I was placed beneath another in the  harem.... Was it well? Did I not love my lord? was the sin mine that no  child was born to him? It is written"]]]
