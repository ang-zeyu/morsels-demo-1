Besides these bubbles, many others sprang up daily, in spite of the  condemnation of the Government and the ridicule of the still sane  portion of the public. The print-shops teemed with caricatures, and  the newspapers with epigrams and satires, upon the prevalent folly. An  ingenious card-maker published a pack of South Sea playing-cards, which  are now extremely rare, each card containing, besides the usual figures,  of a very small size, in one corner, a caricature of a bubble company,  with appropriate verses underneath. One of the most famous bubbles  was \"Puckle's Machine Company,\" for discharging round and square  cannon-balls and bullets, and making a total revolution in the art of  war. Its pretensions to public favour were thus summed up, on the eight  of spades:--         A rare invention to destroy the crowd       Of fools at home, instead of fools abroad.       Fear not, my friends, this terrible machine,       They're only wounded who have shares therein.         The nine of hearts was a caricature of the English Copper and Brass       Company, with the following epigram:--         The headlong fool that wants to be a swopper       Of gold and silver coin for English copper,       May, in Change Alley, prove himself an ass,       And give rich metal for adulterate brass.         The eight of diamonds celebrated the Company for the Colonization of       Acadia, with this doggrel:--         He that is rich and wants to fool away       A good round sum in North America,       Let him subscribe himself a headlong sharer,       And asses' ears shall honour him or bearer.    And in a similar style every card of the pack exposed some knavish  scheme, and ridiculed the persons who were its dupes. It was computed  that the total amount of the sums proposed for carrying on these  projects was upwards of three hundred millions sterling, a sum so  immense that it exceeded the value of all the lands in England at twenty  years' purchase.    It is time, however, to return to the great South Sea gulf, that  swallowed the fortunes of so many thousands of the avaricious and the  credulous. On the 29th of May, the stock had risen as high as five  hundred, and about two-thirds of the government annuitants had exchanged  the securities of the state for those of the South Sea Company. During  the whole of the month of May the stock continued to rise, and on the  28th it was quoted at five hundred and fifty. In four days after this it  took a prodigious leap, rising suddenly from five hundred and fifty to  eight hundred and ninety. It was now the general opinion that the stock  could rise no higher, and many persons took that opportunity of selling  out, with a view of realising their profits. Many noblemen and persons  in the train of the King, and about to accompany him to Hanover, were  also anxious to sell out. So many sellers, and so few buyers, appeared  in the Alley on the 3rd of June, that the stock fell at once from eight  hundred and ninety to six hundred and forty. The directors were alarmed,  and gave their agents orders to buy. Their efforts succeeded. Towards  evening confidence was restored, and the stock advanced to seven hundred  and fifty. It continued at this price, with some slight fluctuation,  until the company closed their books on the 22nd of June.    It would be needless and uninteresting to detail the various arts  employed by the directors to keep up the price of stock. It will be  sufficient to state that it finally rose to one thousand per cent. It  was quoted at this price in the commencement of August. The bubble  was then full-blown, and began to quiver and shake, preparatory to its  bursting.    Many of the government annuitants expressed dissatisfaction against the  directors. They accused them of partiality in making out the lists for  shares in each subscription. Further uneasiness was occasioned by  its being generally known that Sir John Blunt, the chairman, and some  others, had sold out. During the whole of the month of August the stock  fell, and on the 2nd of September it was quoted at seven hundred only.    The state of things now became alarming. To prevent, if possible,  the utter extinction of public confidence in their proceedings, the  directors summoned a general court of the whole corporation, to meet in  Merchant Tailors' Hall, on the 8th of September. By nine o'clock in the  morning, the room was filled to suffocation; Cheapside was blocked up  by a crowd unable to gain admittance, and the greatest excitement  prevailed. The directors and their friends mustered in great numbers.  Sir John Fellowes, the sub-governor, was called to the chair. He  acquainted the assembly with the cause of their meeting, read to them  the several resolutions of the court of directors, and gave them an  account of their proceedings; of the taking in the redeemable and  unredeemable funds, and of the subscriptions in money. Mr. Secretary  Craggs then made a short speech, wherein he commended the conduct of the  directors, and urged that nothing could more effectually contribute to  the bringing this scheme to perfection than union among themselves. He  concluded with a motion for thanking the court of directors for their  prudent and skilful management, and for desiring them to proceed in such  manner as they should think most proper for the interest and advantage  of the corporation. Mr. Hungerford, who had rendered himself very  conspicuous in the House of Commons for his zeal in behalf of the South  Sea Company, and who was shrewdly suspected to have been a considerable  gainer by knowing the right time to sell out, was very magniloquent on  this occasion. He said that he had seen the rise and fall, the decay  and resurrection of many communities of this nature, but that, in his  opinion, none had ever performed such wonderful things in so short a  time as the South Sea Company. They had done more than the crown, the  pulpit, or the bench could do. They had reconciled all parties in one  common interest; they had laid asleep, if not wholly extinguished, all  the domestic jars and animosities of the nation. By the rise of their  stock, monied men had vastly increased their fortunes; country-gentlemen  had seen the value of their lands doubled and trebled in their hands.  They had at the same time done good to the Church, not a few of the  reverend clergy having got great sums by the project. In short, they  had enriched the whole nation, and he hoped they had not forgotten  themselves. There was some hissing at the latter part of this speech,  which for the extravagance of its eulogy was not far removed from  satire; but the directors and their friends, and all the winners in  the room, applauded vehemently. The Duke of Portland spoke in a  similar strain, and expressed his great wonder why anybody should be  dissatisfied: of course, he was a winner by his speculations, and in  a condition similar to that of the fat alderman in Joe Miller's Jests,  who, whenever he had eaten a good dinner, folded his hands upon his  paunch, and expressed his doubts whether there could be a hungry man in  the world.    Several resolutions were passed at this meeting, but they had no effect  upon the public. Upon the very same evening the stock fell to six  hundred and forty, and on the morrow to five hundred and forty. Day  after day it continued to fall, until it was as low as four hundred.  In a letter dated September 13th, from Mr. Broderick, M.P. to Lord  Chancellor Middleton, and published in Coxo's Walpole, the former  says,--\"Various are the conjectures why the South Sea directors have  suffered the cloud to break so early. I made no doubt but they would do  so when they found it to their advantage. They have stretched credit  so far beyond what it would bear, that specie proves insufficient  to support it. Their most considerable men have drawn out, securing  themselves by the losses of the deluded, thoughtless numbers, whose  understandings have been overruled by avarice and the hope of making  mountains out of mole-hills. Thousands of families will be reduced  to beggary. The consternation is inexpressible--the rage beyond  description, and the case altogether so desperate that I do not see any  plan or scheme so much as thought of for averting the blow, so that I  cannot pretend to guess what is next to be done.\" Ten days afterwards,  the stock still falling, he writes,--\"The Company have yet come to no  determination, for they are in such a wood that they know not which way  to turn. By several gentlemen lately come to town, I perceive the very  name of a South-Sea-man grows"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#15)"],[1,"away from Miss Val  Beverley for an hour in the morning, and take advantage of Mr. Camber's  invitation to call upon him.\"    \"Frankly, I doubt if he would acknowledge me.\"    \"Nevertheless, you have a better excuse than I. In the circumstances it  is most important that we should get in touch with this man.\"    \"Very well,\" I said, ruefully. \"I will do my best. But you don't  seriously think, Harley, that the danger comes from there?\"    Paul Harley took his dinner jacket from the chair upon which the man had  laid it out, and turned to me.    \"My dear Knox,\" he said, \"you may remember that I spoke, recently, of  retiring from this profession?\"    \"You did.\"    \"My retirement will not be voluntary, Knox. I shall be kicked out as  an incompetent ass; for, respecting the connection, if any, between the  narrative of Colonel Menendez, the bat wing nailed to the door of the  house, and Mr. Colin Camber, I have not the foggiest notion. In this, at  last, I have triumphed over Auguste Dupin. Auguste Dupin never confessed  defeat.\"          CHAPTER X    THE NIGHT WALKER        If luncheon had seemed extravagant, dinner at Cray's Folly proved to be  a veritable Roman banquet. To associate ideas of selfishness with Miss  Beverley was hateful, but the more I learned of the luxurious life of  this queer household hidden away in the Surrey Hills the less I wondered  at any one's consenting to share such exile. I had hitherto counted an  American freak dinner, organized by a lucky plunger and held at the Cafe  de Paris, as the last word in extravagant feasting. But I learned now  that what was caviare in Monte Carlo was ordinary fare at Cray's Folly.    Colonel Menendez was an epicure with an endless purse. The excellence of  one of the courses upon which I had commented led to a curious incident.    \"You approve of the efforts of my chef?\" said the Colonel.    \"He is worthy of his employer,\" I replied.    Colonel Menendez bowed in his cavalierly fashion and Madame de Staemer  positively beamed upon me.    \"You shall speak for him,\" said the Spaniard. \"He was with me in Cuba,  but has no reputation in London. There are hotels that would snap him  up.\"    I looked at the speaker in surprise.    \"Surely he is not leaving you?\" I asked.    The Colonel exhibited a momentary embarrassment.    \"No, no. No, no,\" he replied, waving his hand gracefully, \"I was only  thinking that he--\" there was a scarcely perceptible pause--\"might wish  to better himself. You understand?\"    I understood only too well; and recollecting the words spoken by Paul  Harley that afternoon, respecting the Colonel's will to live, I became  conscious of an uncomfortable sense of chill.    If I had doubted that in so speaking he had been contemplating his own  death, the behaviour of Madame de Staemer must have convinced me. Her  complexion was slightly but cleverly made up, with all the exquisite  art of the Parisienne, but even through the artificial bloom I saw her  cheeks blanch. Her face grew haggard and her eyes burned unnaturally.  She turned quickly aside to address Paul Harley, but I knew that the  significance of this slight episode had not escaped him.    He was by no means at ease. In the first place, he was badly puzzled;  in the second place, he was angry. He felt it incumbent upon him to save  this man from a menace which he, Paul Harley, evidently recognized to be  real, although to me it appeared wildly chimerical, and the very person  upon whose active cooeperation he naturally counted not only seemed  resigned to his fate, but by deliberate omission of important data added  to Harley's difficulties.    How much of this secret drama proceeding in Cray's Folly was appreciated  by Val Beverley I could not determine. On this occasion, I remember,  she was simply but perfectly dressed and, in my eyes, seemed the most  sweetly desirable woman I had ever known. Realizing that I had already  revealed my interest in the girl, I was oddly self-conscious, and a  hundred times during the progress of dinner I glanced across at Harley,  expecting to detect his quizzical smile. He was very stern, however, and  seemed more reserved than usual. He was uncertain of his ground, I  could see. He resented the understanding which evidently existed between  Colonel Menendez and Madame de Staemer, and to which, although his aid  had been sought, he was not admitted.    It seemed to me, personally, that an almost palpable shadow lay upon  the room. Although, save for this one lapse, our host throughout talked  gaily and entertainingly, I was obsessed by a memory of the expression  which I had detected upon his face that morning, the expression of a  doomed man.    What, in Heaven's name, I asked myself, did it all mean? If ever I saw  the fighting spirit looking out of any man's eyes, it looked out of the  eyes of Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez. Why, then, did he lie down to the  menace of this mysterious Bat Wing, and if he counted opposition futile,  why had he summoned Paul Harley to Cray's Folly?    With the passing of every moment I sympathized more fully with the  perplexity of my friend, and no longer wondered that even his highly  specialized faculties had failed to detect an explanation.    Remembering Colin Camber as I had seen him at the Lavender Arms, it was  simply impossible to suppose that such a man as Menendez could fear such  a man as Camber. True, I had seen the latter at a disadvantage, and  I knew well enough that many a genius has been also a drunkard. But  although I was prepared to find that Colin Camber possessed genius, I  found it hard to believe that this was of a criminal type. That such a  character could be the representative of some remote negro society was  an idea too grotesque to be entertained for a moment.    I was tempted to believe that his presence in the neighbourhood of this  haunted Cuban was one of those strange coincidences which in criminal  history have sometimes proved so tragic for their victims.    Madame de Staemer, avoiding the Colonel's glances, which were  pathetically apologetic, gradually recovered herself, and:    \"My dear,\" she said to Val Beverley, \"you look perfectly sweet to-night.  Don't you think she looks perfectly sweet, Mr. Knox?\"    Ignoring a look of entreaty from the blue-gray eyes:    \"Perfectly,\" I replied.    \"Oh, Mr. Knox,\" cried the girl, \"why do you encourage her? She says  embarrassing things like that every time I put on a new dress.\"    Her reference to a new dress set me speculating again upon the apparent  anomaly of her presence at Cray's Folly. That she was not a professional  \"companion\" was clear enough. I assumed that her father had left her  suitably provided for, since she wore such expensively simple gowns. She  had a delightful trick of blushing when attention was focussed upon her,  and said Madame de Staemer:    \"To be able to blush like that I would give my string of pearls--no,  half of it.\"    \"My dear Marie,\" declared Colonel Menendez, \"I have seen you blush  perfectly.\"    \"No, no,\" Madame disclaimed the suggestion with one of those Bernhardt  gestures, \"I blushed my last blush when my second husband introduced me  to my first husband's wife.\"    \"Madame!\" exclaimed Val Beverley, \"how can you say such things?\" She  turned to me. \"Really, Mr. Knox, they are all fables.\"    \"In fables we renew our youth,\" said Madame.    \"Ah,\" sighed Colonel Menendez; \"our youth, our youth.\"    \"Why sigh, Juan, why regret?\" cried Madame, immediately. \"Old age is  only tragic to those who have never been young.\"    She directed a glance toward him as she spoke those words, and as I had  felt when I had seen his tragic face on the veranda that morning I felt  again in detecting this look of Madame de Staemer's. The yearning yet  selfless love which it expressed was not for my eyes to witness.    \"Thank God, Marie,\" replied the Colonel, and gallantly kissed his hand  to her, \"we have both been young, gloriously young.\"    When, at the termination of this truly historic dinner, the ladies left  us:    \"Remember, Juan,\" said Madame, raising her white, jewelled hand, and  holding the fingers characteristically curled, \"no excitement, no  billiards, no cards.\"    Colonel Menendez bowed deeply, as the invalid wheeled herself from the  room, followed by Miss Beverley. My heart was beating delightfully, for  in the moment of departure the latter had favoured me with a significant  glance, which seemed to say, \"I am looking forward to a chat with you  presently.\"    \"Ah,\" said Colonel Menendez, when we three men found ourselves alone,  \"truly I am blessed in the autumn of my life with such charming  companionship. Beauty and wit, youth and discretion. Is he not a happy  man who possesses all these?\"    \"He should be,\" said Harley, gravely.    The saturnine Pedro entered with some wonderful crusted port, and  Colonel Menendez offered cigars.    \"I believe you are a pipe-smoker,\" said our courteous host to Harley,  \"and if this is so, I know that you will prefer your favourite mixture  to any cigar that ever was rolled.\"    \"Many thanks,\" said Harley, to whom no more delicate compliment could  have been paid.    He was indeed an inveterate pipe-smoker, and only rarely did he truly  enjoy a cigar, however choice its pedigree. With a sigh of content  he began to fill his briar. His mood was more restful, and covertly I  watched him studying our host. The night remained very warm and one of  the two windows of the dining room, which was the most homely apartment  in Cray's Folly, was wide open, offering a prospect of sweeping velvet  lawns touched by the magic of the moonlight.    A short silence fell, to be broken by the Colonel.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I trust you do not regret your fishing  excursion?\"    \"I could cheerfully pass the rest of my days in such ideal  surroundings,\" replied Paul Harley.    I nodded in agreement.    \"But,\" continued my friend, speaking very deliberately, \"I have"]]]
