But Tsou Yen also considered  the form of the world, and was the first to put forward the theory that  the world consists not of a single continent with China in the middle of  it, but of nine continents. The names of these continents sound like  Indian names, and his idea of a central world-mountain may well have  come from India. The \"scholars\" of his time were quite unable to  appreciate this beginning of science, which actually led to the  contention of this school, in the first century B.C., that the earth was  of spherical shape. Tsou Yen himself was ridiculed as a dreamer; but  very soon, when the idea of the reciprocal destruction of the elements  was applied, perhaps by Tsou Yen himself, to politics, namely when, in  connection with the astronomical calculations much cultivated by this  school and through the identification of dynasties with the five  elements, the attempt was made to explain and to calculate the duration  and the supersession of dynasties, strong pressure began to be brought  to bear against this school. For hundreds of years its books were  distributed and read only in secret, and many of its members were  executed as revolutionaries. Thus, this school, instead of becoming the  nucleus of a school of natural science, was driven underground. The  secret societies which started to arise clearly from the first century  B.C. on, but which may have been in existence earlier, adopted the  politico-scientific ideas of Tsou Yen's school. Such secret societies  have existed in China down to the present time. They all contained a  strong religious, but heterodox element which can often be traced back  to influences from a foreign religion. In times of peace they were  centres of a true, emotional religiosity. In times of stress, a  \"messianic\" element tended to become prominent: the world is bad and  degenerating; morality and a just social order have decayed, but the  coming of a savior is close; the saviour will bring a new, fair order  and destroy those who are wicked. Tsou Yen's philosophy seemed to allow  them to calculate when this new order would start; later secret  societies contained ideas from Iranian Mazdaism, Manichaeism and  Buddhism, mixed with traits from the popular religions and often couched  in terms taken from the Taoists. The members of such societies were,  typically, ordinary farmers who here found an emotional outlet for their  frustrations in daily life. In times of stress, members of the leading  _elite_ often but not always established contacts with these societies,  took over their leadership and led them to open rebellion. The fate of  Tsou Yen's school did not mean that the Chinese did not develop in the  field of sciences. At about Tsou Yen's lifetime, the first mathematical  handbook was written. From these books it is obvious that the interest  of the government in calculating the exact size of fields, the content  of measures for grain, and other fiscal problems stimulated work in this  field, just as astronomy developed from the interest of the government  in the fixation of the calendar. Science kept on developing in other  fields, too, but mainly as a hobby of scholars and in the shops of  craftsmen, if it did not have importance for the administration and  especially taxation and budget calculations.        Chapter Five      THE CH'IN DYNASTY (256-207 B.C.)    1 _Towards the unitary State_    In 256 B.C. the last ruler of the Chou dynasty abdicated in favour of  the feudal lord of the state of Ch'in. Some people place the beginning  of the Ch'in dynasty in that year, 256 B.C.; others prefer the date 221  B.C., because it was only in that year that the remaining feudal states  came to their end and Ch'in really ruled all China.    The territories of the state of Ch'in, the present Shensi and eastern  Kansu, were from a geographical point of view transit regions, closed  off in the north by steppes and deserts and in the south by almost  impassable mountains. Only between these barriers, along the rivers Wei  (in Shensi) and T'ao (in Kansu), is there a rich cultivable zone which  is also the only means of transit from east to west. All traffic from  and to Turkestan had to take this route. It is believed that strong  relations with eastern Turkestan began in this period, and the state of  Ch'in must have drawn big profits from its \"foreign trade\". The merchant  class quickly gained more and more importance. The population was  growing through immigration from the east which the government  encouraged. This growing population with its increasing means of  production, especially the great new irrigation systems, provided a  welcome field for trade which was also furthered by the roads, though  these were actually built for military purposes.    The state of Ch'in had never been so closely associated with the feudal  communities of the rest of China as the other feudal states. A great  part of its population, including the ruling class, was not purely  Chinese but contained an admixture of Turks and Tibetans. The other  Chinese even called Ch'in a \"barbarian state\", and the foreign influence  was, indeed, unceasing. This was a favourable soil for the overcoming of  feudalism, and the process was furthered by the factors mentioned in the  preceding chapter, which were leading to a change in the social  structure of China. Especially the recruitment of the whole population,  including the peasantry, for war was entirely in the interest of the  influential nomad fighting peoples within the state. About 250 B.C.,  Ch'in was not only one of the economically strongest among the feudal  states, but had already made an end of its own feudal system.    Every feudal system harbours some seeds of a bureaucratic system of  administration: feudal lords have their personal servants who are not  recruited from the nobility, but who by their easy access to the lord  can easily gain importance. They may, for instance, be put in charge of  estates, workshops, and other properties of the lord and thus acquire  experience in administration and an efficiency which are obviously of  advantage to the lord. When Chinese lords of the preceding period, with  the help of their sub-lords of the nobility, made wars, they tended to  put the newly-conquered areas not into the hands of newly-enfeoffed  noblemen, but to keep them as their property and to put their  administration into the hands of efficient servants; these were the  first bureaucratic officials. Thus, in the course of the later Chou  period, a bureaucratic system of administration had begun to develop,  and terms like \"district\" or \"prefecture\" began to appear, indicating  that areas under a bureaucratic administration existed beside and inside  areas under feudal rule. This process had gone furthest in Ch'in and was  sponsored by the representatives of the Legalist School, which was best  adapted to the new economic and social situation.    A son of one of the concubines of the penultimate feudal ruler of Ch'in  was living as a hostage in the neighbouring state of Chao, in what is  now northern Shansi. There he made the acquaintance of an unusual man,  the merchant Lue Pu-wei, a man of education and of great political  influence. Lue Pu-wei persuaded the feudal ruler of Ch'in to declare this  son his successor. He also sold a girl to the prince to be his wife, and  the son of this marriage was to be the famous and notorious Shih  Huang-ti. Lue Pu-wei came with his protege to Ch'in, where he became his  Prime Minister, and after the prince's death in 247 B.C. Lue Pu-wei  became the regent for his young son Shih Huang-ti (then called Cheng).  For the first time in Chinese history a merchant, a commoner, had  reached one of the highest positions in the state. It is not known what  sort of trade Lue Pu-wei had carried on, but probably he dealt in horses,  the principal export of the state of Chao. As horses were an absolute  necessity for the armies of that time, it is easy to imagine that a  horse-dealer might gain great political influence.    Soon after Shih Huang-ti's accession Lue Pu-wei was dismissed, and a new  group of advisers, strong supporters of the Legalist school, came into  power. These new men began an active policy of conquest instead of the  peaceful course which Lue Pu-wei had pursued. One campaign followed  another in the years from 230 to 222, until all the feudal states had  been conquered, annexed, and brought under Shih Huang-ti's rule.    2 _Centralization in every field_    The main task of the now gigantic realm was the organization of  administration. One of the first acts after the conquest of the other  feudal states was to deport all the ruling families and other important  nobles to the capital of Ch'in; they were thus deprived of the basis of  their power, and their land could be sold. These upper-class families  supplied to the capital a class of consumers of luxury goods which  attracted craftsmen and businessmen and changed the character of the  capital from that of a provincial town to a centre of arts and crafts.  It was decided to set up the uniform system of administration throughout  the realm, which had already been successfully introduced in Ch'in: the  realm was split up into provinces and the provinces into prefectures;  and an official was placed in charge of each province or prefecture.  Originally the prefectures in Ch'in had been placed directly under the  central administration, with an official, often a merchant, being  responsible for the collection of taxes; the provinces, on the other  hand, formed a sort of military command area, especially in the  newly-conquered frontier territories. With the growing militarization of  Ch'in, greater importance was assigned to the provinces, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#16)"],[1," the same first lessons in sawing, planing, lumber dressing, making  mortises, tenons, and joints, and in general use of tools--just the kind  of instruction that every English lad should have before he is shipped  off to the Colonies. This farmer's course in the Kansas College provides  for a general training in mechanical handiwork, but facilities are given  also to those who wish to follow out the trade, and special instruction  is provided in the whole range of work, from framing to stair-building,  as also in iron work, such as ordinary forging, filing, tempering, etc.  Of the students attending this college, 75 percent, are from farmers'  homes, and the majority of the remainder from the families of mechanics  and tradesmen.    The State College of Maine provides courses for both civil and  mechanical engineers, and has two shops equipped according to the  Russian system. Forge and vise work are taught in them, though it is not  the object of the college so much to teach the details of any one trade  as to qualify students by general knowledge to undertake any of them  afterward. A much more complete and thorough technical education is  given in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Boston, where  there are distinct classes for civil, mechanical, mining, geological,  and architectural engineering. The following are the particulars of the  instruction in the architectural branch, which commences in the  student's second year, with Greek, Roman, and Mediaeval architectural  history, the Orders and their applications, drawing, sketching, and  tracing, analytic geometry, differential calculus, physics, descriptive  geometry, botany, and physical geography. In the third year the course  is extended to the theory of decoration, color, form, and proportion;  conventionalism, symbolism, the decorative arts, stained glass, fresco  painting, tiles, terra-cotta, original designs, specifications, integral  calculus, strength of materials, dynamics, bridges and roofs,  stereotomy. In the fourth year the student is turned out a finished  architect, after a course of the history of ornament, the theory of  architecture, stability of structure, flow of gases, shopwork  (carpentry), etc.    The number of students in this very comprehensive Institute of  Technology was, by the latest report, 390, of whom 138 were undergoing  special courses, 39 were in the schools of mechanical art, and 49 in the  Lowell School of Practical Design. Tuition is charged at the rate of 200  dols. for the institute proper, and 150 dols. for the mechanical  schools, the average expenses per student being about 254 dols. There  are 10 free scholarships, of which two are given for mechanical art. The  Lowell School has been established by the trustee of the Lowell  Institute to afford free technical education, under the auspices of the  Institute of Technology, to both sexes--a large number of young women  availing themselves of it in connection with their factory work at  Lowell. The courses include practical designs for manufactures, and the  art of making patterns for prints, delaines, silks, paperhangings,  carpets, oilcloth, etc., and the school is amply provided with pattern  looms. Indeed, the whole of the appliances for practical teaching at the  Institute are on such a complete scale that at the risk of being a  little tedious it is as well to enumerate them. They comprise  laboratories devoted to chemistry, mineralogy, metallurgy, and  industrial chemistry; there are also microscopic, spectroscopic, and  organic laboratories. In other branches there are laboratories and  museums of steam engineering, mining, and metallurgy, biology and  architecture, together with an observatory, much used in connection with  geodesy and practical astronomy. The steam engineering laboratory  provides practice in testing, adjusting, and managing steam machinery.  The appliances in connection with mining and metallurgy include a  five-stamp battery, Blake crusher, automatic machine jigs, an engine  pulverizer, a Root and a Sturtevant blower, with blast reverberating,  wasting, cupellation, and fusion furnaces, and all other means for  reducing ores. The architectural museum contains many thousand casts,  models, photographs, and drawings. The shops for handwork are large and  well arranged, and include a vise-shop, forge shop, machine, tool, and  lathe shops, foundry, rooms for pattern making, weaving, and other  industrial institutions. The vise-shop contains four heavy benches, with  32 vises attached, giving a capacity for teaching 128 students the  course every ten weeks, or 640 in a year of fifty weeks. The forge-shop  has eight forges. The foundry has 16 moulding benches, an oven for core  baking, and a blast furnace of one-half ton capacity. The  pattern-weaving room is provided with five looms, one of them in  20-harness, and 4-shuttle looms, and another an improved Jacquard  pattern loom. It may safely be said that there is nor an establishment  in the world better equipped for industrial and technical education than  this Institute of Massachusetts.--_London Building News_.           *       *       *       *       *    IVORY GETTING SCARCE.--The stock of ivory in London is estimated at  about forty tons in dealers' private warehouses, whereas formerly they  usually held about one hundred tons.

Fakirs are religious mendicants who, for the purpose of exciting the  charity of the public, assume positions in which it would seem  impossible that they could remain, submit themselves to fearful  tortures, or else, by their mode of living, their abstinence, and their  indifference to inclement weather and to external things, try to make  believe that, owing to their sanctity, they are of a species superior to  that of common mortals.    In the Indies, these fakirs visit all the great markets, all religious  fetes, and usually all kinds of assemblages, in order to exhibit,  themselves. If one of them exhibits some new peculiarity, some curious  deformity, a strange posture, or, finally, any physiological curiosity  whatever that surpasses those of his confreres, he becomes the  attraction of the fete, and the crowd surrounds him, and small coin and  rupees begin to fall into his bowl.    Fakirs, like all persons who voluntarily torture themselves, are curious  examples of the modifications that will, patience, and, so to speak,  \"art\" can introduce into human nature, and into the sensitiveness and  functions of the organs. If these latter are capable of being improved,  of having their functions developed and of acquiring more strength (as,  for example, the muscles of boxers, the breast of foot racers, the voice  of singers, etc.), these same organs, on the contrary, can be atrophied  or modified, and their functions be changed in nature. It is in such  degradation and such degeneration of human nature that fakirs excel, and  it is from such a point of view that they are worth studying.    We may, so to speak, class these individuals according to the grades of  punishments that they inflict upon themselves, or according to the  deformities that they have caused themselves to undergo. But, as we have  already said, the number of both of these is extremely varied, each  fakir striving in this respect to eclipse his fellows. It is only  necessary to open a book of Indian travel to find descriptions of fakirs  in abundance; and such descriptions might seem exaggerated or unlikely  were they not so concordant. The following are a few examples:    _Immovable fakirs_.--The number of these is large. They remain immovable  in the spot they have selected, and that too for an exceedingly long  period of time. An example of one of these is cited who remained  standing for twelve years, his arms crossed upon his breast, without  moving and without lying or sitting down. In such cases charitable  persons always take it upon themselves to prevent the fakir from dying  of starvation. Some remain sitting, immovable, and apparently lifeless,  while others, who lie stretched out upon the ground, look like corpses.  It may be easily imagined what a state one of these beings is in after a  few months or years of immobility. He is extremely lean, his limbs are  atrophied, his body is black with filth and dust, his hair is long and  dishevelled, his beard is shaggy, his finger and toe nails have become  genuine claws, and his aspect is frightful. This, however, is a  character common to all fakirs.    We may likewise class among the immovables those fakirs who cause  themselves to be interred up to the neck, and who remain thus with their  head sticking out of the ground either during the entire time the fair  or fete lasts or for months and years.    _Anchylotic Fakirs_.--The number of fakirs who continue to hold one or  both arms outstretched is very large in India. The following description  of one of them is given by a traveler: \"He was a goussain--a religious  mendicant--who had dishevelled hair and beard, and horrible tattooings  upon his face, and, what was most hideous, was his left arm, which,  withered and anchylosed, stuck up perpendicularly from the shoulder. His  closed hand, surrounded by straps, had been traversed by the nails,  which, continuing to grow, had bent like claws on the other side.  Finally, the hollow of this hand, which was filled with earth, served as  a pot for a small sacred myrtle.\"    Other fakirs hold their two arms above their head, the hands crossed,  and remain perpetually in such a position. Others again have one or both  arms extended. Some hang by their feet from the limb of a tree by means  of a cord, and"]]]
