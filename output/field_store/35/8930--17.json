As one  That makes no pause, but presses on his road,  Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need  Impel: so enter'd we upon our way,  One before other; for, but singly, none  That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.    E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing  Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit  The nest, and drops it; so in me desire  Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,  Arriving even to the act, that marks  A man prepar'd for speech.  Him all our haste  Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:  Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip  Stands trembling for its flight.  Encourag'd thus  I straight began: \"How there can leanness come,  Where is no want of nourishment to feed?\"    \"If thou,\" he answer'd, \"hadst remember'd thee,  How Meleager with the wasting brand  Wasted alike, by equal fires consum'd,  This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,  How in the mirror your reflected form  With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems  Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp  Of summer fruit mature.  But that thy will  In certainty may find its full repose,  Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray  That he would now be healer of thy wound.\"    \"If in thy presence I unfold to him  The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead  Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.\"  So Statius answer'd, and forthwith began:  \"Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind  Receive them: so shall they be light to clear  The doubt thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,  Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd,  And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en  From the replenish'd table, in the heart  Derives effectual virtue, that informs  The several human limbs, as being that,  Which passes through the veins itself to make them.  Yet more concocted it descends, where shame  Forbids to mention: and from thence distils  In natural vessel on another's blood.  Then each unite together, one dispos'd  T' endure, to act the other, through meet frame  Of its recipient mould: that being reach'd,  It 'gins to work, coagulating first;  Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd  To bear.  With animation now indued,  The active virtue (differing from a plant  No further, than that this is on the way  And at its limit that) continues yet  To operate, that now it moves, and feels,  As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there  Assumes th' organic powers its seed convey'd.  'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,  That from the generating heart proceeds,  Is pliant and expansive; for each limb  Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.  How babe of animal becomes, remains  For thy consid'ring.  At this point, more wise,  Than thou hast err'd, making the soul disjoin'd  From passive intellect, because he saw  No organ for the latter's use assign'd.    \"Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.  Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,  Articulation is complete, then turns  The primal Mover with a smile of joy  On such great work of nature, and imbreathes  New spirit replete with virtue, that what here  Active it finds, to its own substance draws,  And forms an individual soul, that lives,  And feels, and bends reflective on itself.  And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,  Mark the sun's heat, how that to wine doth change,  Mix'd with the moisture filter'd through the vine.    \"When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul  Takes with her both the human and divine,  Memory, intelligence, and will, in act  Far keener than before, the other powers  Inactive all and mute.  No pause allow'd,  In wond'rous sort self-moving, to one strand  Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,  Here learns her destin'd path.  Soon as the place  Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,  Distinct as in the living limbs before:  And as the air, when saturate with showers,  The casual beam refracting, decks itself  With many a hue; so here the ambient air  Weareth that form, which influence of the soul  Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where  The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth  The new form on the spirit follows still:  Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd,  With each sense even to the sight endued:  Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs  Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount  Th' obedient shadow fails not to present  Whatever varying passion moves within us.  And this the cause of what thou marvel'st at.\"    Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd,  And to the right hand turning, other care  Awaits us.  Here the rocky precipice  Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim  A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff  Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.    Behoov'd us, one by one, along the side,  That border'd on the void, to pass; and I  Fear'd on one hand the fire, on th' other fear'd  Headlong to fall: when thus th' instructor warn'd:  \"Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.  A little swerving and the way is lost.\"    Then from the bosom of the burning mass,  \"O God of mercy!\" heard I sung; and felt  No less desire to turn.  And when I saw  Spirits along the flame proceeding, I  Between their footsteps and mine own was fain  To share by turns my view.  At the hymn's close  They shouted loud, \"I do not know a man;\"  Then in low voice again took up the strain,  Which once more ended, \"To the wood,\" they cried,  \"Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung  With Cytherea's poison:\" then return'd  Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll'd,  Who liv'd in virtue chastely, and the bands  Of wedded love.  Nor from that task, I ween,  Surcease they; whilesoe'er the scorching fire  Enclasps them.  Of such skill appliance needs  To medicine the wound, that healeth last.      CANTO XXVI    While singly thus along the rim we walk'd,  Oft the good master warn'd me: \"Look thou well.  Avail it that I caution thee.\"  The sun  Now all the western clime irradiate chang'd  From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd,  My passing shadow made the umber'd flame  Burn ruddier.  At so strange a sight I mark'd  That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.    This bred occasion first to speak of me,  \"He seems,\" said they, \"no insubstantial frame:\"  Then to obtain what certainty they might,  Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass  The burning pale.  \"O thou, who followest  The others, haply not more slow than they,  But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn  In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these  All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth  Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.  Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself  A wall against the sun, as thou not yet  Into th' inextricable toils of death  Hadst enter'd?\"  Thus spake one, and I had straight  Declar'd me, if attention had not turn'd  To new appearance.  Meeting these, there came,  Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom  Earnestly gazing, from each part I view  The shadows all press forward, sev'rally  Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.  E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,  Peer closely one at other, to spy out  Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.    That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch  Of the first onward step, from either tribe  Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,  Shout \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\" these, \"The cow  Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd  Might rush unto her luxury.\"  Then as cranes,  That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,  Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid  The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off  One crowd, advances th' other; and resume  Their first song weeping, and their several shout.    Again drew near my side the very same,  Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks  Mark'd eagerness to listen.  I, who twice  Their will had noted, spake: \"O spirits secure,  Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!  My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,  Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed  With blood, and sinew-strung.  That I no more  May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.  There is a dame on high, who wind for us  This grace, by which my mortal through your realm  I bear.  But may your utmost wish soon meet  Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,  Fullest of love, and of most ample space,  Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page  Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,  And what this multitude, that at your backs  Have past behind us.\"  As one, mountain-bred,  Rugged and clownish, if some city's walls  He chance to enter, round him stares agape,  Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd  Each spirit.  But when rid of that amaze,  (Not long the inmate of a noble heart)  He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:  \"O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st  Experience of our limits, in thy bark!  Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,  For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard  The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him.  Hence their cry  Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke  Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame.  Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,  Because the law of human kind we broke,  Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,  Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace  Record the name of her, by whom the beast  In bestial tire was acted.  Now our deeds  Thou know'st, and how we sinn'd.  If thou by name  Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now  To tell so much, nor can I.  Of myself  Learn what thou wishest.

For these reasons, the framers of the  Constitution were unwilling to vest in the President exclusively the  immeasurable power of pledging the faith, man-power, and resources of  the nation and of declaring war. The heterogeneous character of our  population especially emphasizes the wisdom of this course, for it would  be difficult, if not impossible, for an American President to make an  offensive and defensive alliance with any nation or declare war against  another nation without running counter to the racial interests and  passions of a substantial part of the American nation. For better or  worse, the United States has limited, but not destroyed, as the world  war showed, its freedom to antagonize powerful nations from whose people  it has drawn large numbers of its own citizenship. The domestic harmony  of the nation requires that before the United States assumes treaty  obligations or makes war such policy shall represent the largely  preponderating sentiment of its people, and nothing could more  effectually secure this end than to require the President, before making  a treaty, to secure the assent of two-thirds of the Senate and a  majority of both Houses of Congress before making war.    While this may lead, as it has in recent years, to temporary and  regrettable embarrassments, yet in the long run, it is not only better  for the United States, but it is even to the best interests of other  nations, for in this way they are safeguarded against the possible  action of an Executive with whom racial instincts might still be very  influential. In your country, where the Government of the day is subject  to immediate dismissal for want of confidence, such power over foreign  relations can be safely entrusted to a few men, but in the United  States, with its fixed tenures of office, a President could pledge the  faith and involve his nation in war against the interests and will of  the people. Suppose the President had unlimited power over our foreign  relations and that within the next ten years an American, whose parents  were born in any European nation, was elected on purely domestic issues,  he could, with his assured four years of power, bring about a new  alignment of nations and shake the political equilibrium of the world.  The Constitution wisely refused to grant such a power. Hence the  provision for the concurrence of the legislative representatives of the  nation. At all events, it constitutes a system which, as the last  presidential election showed, the American people will not willingly  forgo. It is true that this system makes it difficult for the United  States to participate effectively in the main purpose of the League of  Nations to enforce peace by joint action at Geneva, but to ask the  United States to surrender a vital part of its constitutional system,  upon which its domestic peace so largely depends, in order to promote  the League, seems to me as unreasonable as it would be to ask your  country to abolish the Crown, to which it is sincerely attached as a  vital part of its system, as a contribution towards international  co-operation. You would not surrender such an integral part of your  system, and therefore it is not reasonable to expect a similar sacrifice  on our part, even though the meritorious purposes of the League be  freely recognized.    I have thus summarized briefly and most inadequately some of the  essential principles of the Constitution. I have only been able to  suggest very impressionistically what they are and the lessons to be  drawn from them. If I were able to deliver a dozen addresses on the  subject in this historic Hall and with this indulgent audience I would  not scratch even the surface. To understand the Constitution of the  United States you must not only read the text but the thousands of  opinions rendered in the last 130 years by the Supreme Court in its  great task of interpreting this wonderful document. Few documents have  been the subject of more extended commentaries. The four thousand words  have been meticulously examined through intellectual microscopes in  judicial opinions, textbooks, and other commentaries which are as \"thick  as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in Vallombrosa.\"    One can say of this document as Dr. Furness, in his variorum edition of  _Hamlet_, says of the words of that character:        \"No words by him let fall, no syllable by him uttered, but has been      caught up and pondered, as no words except those of Holy Writ.\"    But what of its future and how long will the Constitution wholly resist  the washing of time and circumstance? Lord Macaulay once ventured the  prediction that the Constitution would prove unworkable as soon as there  were no longer large areas of undeveloped land and when the United  States became a nation of great cities. That period of development has  arrived. In 1880 only 15 per cent. of the American population lived in  the cities and the remainder were still on the farms. To-day over 52 per  cent, are crowded in one hundred great cities. Lord Macaulay added:        \"I believe America's fate is only deferred by physical causes.      Institutions purely democratic will sooner or later destroy liberty      or civilization, or both.... The American Constitution is all sail      and no anchor.\"    In this last commentary Lord Macaulay was clearly mistaken. As I have  shown, the Constitution is not \"purely democratic.\" It is amazing that  so great a mind should have so little understood that more than any  other Constitution, that of America imposes powerful restraints on  democracy. The experience of a century and a quarter has shown that  while the anchor may at times drag, yet it measurably holds the ship of  state to its ancient moorings. The American Constitution still remains  in its essential principles and still enjoys not only the confidence but  the affection of the great and varied people whom it rules. To the  latter this remarkable achievement must be attributed rather than to any  inherent strength in parchment or red seals, for in a democracy the  living soul of any Constitution must be such belief of the people in its  wisdom and justice. If it should perish to-morrow, it would yet have  enjoyed a life and growth of which any nation or age might be justly  proud. Moreover, it could claim with truth, if it finally perished, that  it had been subjected to conditions for which it was never intended and  that some of its essential principles had been ignored.    The Constitution is something more than a written formula of  government--it is a great spirit. It is a high and noble assertion,  and, indeed, vindication, of the morality of government. It \"renders  unto Caesar [the political state] the things that are Caesar's,\" but in  safeguarding the fundamental moral rights of the people, it \"renders  unto God the things that are God's.\"    In concluding, I cannot refrain from again reminding you that this  consummate work of statecraft was the work of the English-speaking race,  and that your people can therefore justly share in the pride which it  awakens. It is not only one of the great achievements of that _gens  aeterna_, but also one of the great monuments of human progress. It  illustrates the possibilities of true democracy in its best estate. When  the moral anarchy out of which it was born is called to mind, it can be  truly said that while \"sown in weakness, it was raised in power.\"    To the succeeding ages, it will be a flaming beacon, and everywhere men,  who are confronted with the acute problems of this complex age, can  take encouragement from the fact that a small and weak people, when  confronted with similar problems, had the strength and will to impose  restraint upon themselves by peacefully proclaiming in the simple words  of the noble preamble to the Constitution:        \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more      perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity,      provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and      secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do      ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of      America.\"    Note the words \"ordain and establish.\" They imply perpetuity. They make  no provision for the secession of any State, even if it deems itself  aggrieved by federal action. And yet the right to secede was urged for  many years, but Lincoln completed the work of Washington, Franklin,  Madison and Hamilton by establishing that \"a government for the people,  by the people and of the people should not perish from the earth.\"          _IV. The Revolt Against Authority_      \"Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the  law, happy is he.\"    PROVERBS xxix. 18.    One of the most quoted--and also mis-quoted--proverbs of the wise  Solomon says, as translated in the authorized version: \"Where there is  no vision, the people perish.\" What Solomon actually said was: \"Where  there is no vision, the people _cast off restraint_.\" The translator  thus confused an effect with a cause. What was the vision to which the  Wise Man referred? The rest of the proverb, which is rarely quoted,  explains:    \"Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint: _but he that  keepeth the law, happy is he_.\"    The vision, then, is the authority of law, and Solomon's warning is  that to which the great and noble founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn,  many centuries later gave utterance, when he said:    \"That government is free to the people under it, where the laws rule and  the people are a party to those laws; and all the rest is tyranny,  oligarchy and confusion.\"    It is my present purpose to discuss the moral psychology of"]]]
