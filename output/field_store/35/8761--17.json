The spectator is too ready to look for a meaning in a picture--i.e.,  some outward connection between its various parts. Our materialistic age  has produced a type of spectator or \"connoisseur,\" who is not content to  put himself opposite a picture and let it say its own message. Instead  of allowing the inner value of the picture to work, he worries himself  in looking for \"closeness to nature,\" or \"temperament,\" or \"handling,\"  or \"tonality,\" or \"perspective,\" or what not. His eye does not probe the  outer expression to arrive at the inner meaning. In a conversation with  an interesting person, we endeavour to get at his fundamental ideas and  feelings. We do not bother about the words he uses, nor the spelling of  those words, nor the breath necessary for speaking them, nor the  movements of his tongue and lips, nor the psychological working on our  brain, nor the physical sound in our ear, nor the physiological effect  on our nerves. We realize that these things, though interesting and  important, are not the main things of the moment, but that the meaning  and idea is what concerns us. We should have the same feeling when  confronted with a work of art. When this becomes general the artist will  be able to dispense with natural form and colour and speak in purely  artistic language.    To return to the combination of colour and form, there is another  possibility which should be noted. Non-naturalistic objects in a  picture may have a \"literary\" appeal, and the whole picture may  have the working of a fable. The spectator is put in an  atmosphere which does not disturb him because he accepts it as  fabulous, and in which he tries to trace the story and undergoes  more or less the various appeals of colour. But the pure inner  working of colour is impossible; the outward idea has the mastery  still. For the spectator has only exchanged a blind reality for a  blind dreamland, where the truth of inner feeling cannot be felt.    We must find, therefore, a form of expression which excludes the  fable and yet does not restrict the free working of colour in any  way. The forms, movement, and colours which we borrow from nature  must produce no outward effect nor be associated with external  objects. The more obvious is the separation from nature, the more  likely is the inner meaning to be pure and unhampered.    The tendency of a work of art may be very simple, but provided it  is not dictated by any external motive and provided it is not  working to any material end, the harmony will be pure. The most  ordinary action--for example, preparation for lifting a heavy  weight--becomes mysterious and dramatic, when its actual purpose  is not revealed. We stand and gaze fascinated, till of a sudden  the explanation bursts suddenly upon us. It is the conviction  that nothing mysterious can ever happen in our everyday life that  has destroyed the joy of abstract thought. Practical  considerations have ousted all else. It is with this fact in view  that the new dancing is being evolved--as, that is to say, the  only means of giving in terms of time and space the real inner  meaning of motion. The origin of dancing is probably purely  sexual. In folk-dances we still see this element plainly. The  later development of dancing as a religious ceremony joins itself  to the preceding element and the two together take artistic form  and emerge as the ballet.    The ballet at the present time is in a state of chaos owing to  this double origin. Its external motives--the expression of love  and fear, etc.--are too material and naive for the abstract ideas  of the future. In the search for more subtle expression, our  modern reformers have looked to the past for help. Isadora Duncan  has forged a link between the Greek dancing and that of the  future. In this she is working on parallel lines to the painters  who are looking for inspiration from the primitives.    [Footnote: Kandinsky's example of Isadora Duncan is not perhaps  perfectly chosen. This famous dancer founds her art mainly upon a  study of Greek vases and not necessarily of the primitive period.  Her aims are distinctly towards what Kandinsky calls  \"conventional beauty,\" and what is perhaps more important, her  movements are not dictated solely by the \"inner harmony,\" but  largely by conscious outward imitation of Greek attitudes. Either  Nijinsky's later ballets: Le Sacre du Printemps, L'Apres-midi  d'un Faune, Jeux, or the idea actuating the Jacques Dalcroze  system of Eurhythmics seem to fall more into line with  Kandinsky's artistic forecast. In the first case \"conventional  beauty\" has been abandoned, to the dismay of numbers of writers  and spectators, and a definite return has been made to primitive  angles and abruptness. In the second case motion and dance are  brought out of the souls of the pupils, truly spontaneous, at  the call of the \"inner harmony.\" Indeed a comparison between  Isadora Duncan and M. Dalcroze is a comparison between the  \"naturalist\" and \"symbolist\" ideals in art which were outlined in  the introduction to this book.--M.T.H.S.]    In dance as in painting this is only a stage of transition. In  dancing as in painting we are on the threshold of the art of the  future. The same rules must be applied in both cases.  Conventional beauty must go by the board and the literary element  of \"story-telling\" or \"anecdote\" must be abandoned as useless.  Both arts must learn from music that every harmony and every  discord which springs from the inner spirit is beautiful, but  that it is essential that they should spring from the inner  spirit and from that alone.    The achievement of the dance-art of the future will make possible  the first ebullition of the art of spiritual harmony--the true  stage-composition.    The composition for the new theatre will consist of these three  elements:         (1) Musical movement       (2) Pictorial movement       (3) Physical movement    and these three, properly combined, make up the spiritual  movement, which is the working of the inner harmony. They will be  interwoven in harmony and discord as are the two chief elements  of painting, form and colour.    Scriabin's attempt to intensify musical tone by corresponding use of  colour is necessarily tentative. In the perfected stage-composition the  two elements are increased by the third, and endless possibilities of  combination and individual use are opened up. Further, the external can  be combined with the internal harmony, as Schonberg has attempted in his  quartettes. It is impossible here to go further into the developments of  this idea. The reader must apply the principles of painting already  stated to the problem of stage-composition, and outline for himself the  possibilities of the theatre of the future, founded on the immovable  principle of the inner need.    From what has been said of the combination of colour and form,  the way to the new art can be traced. This way lies today between  two dangers. On the one hand is the totally arbitrary application  of colour to geometrical form--pure patterning. On the other hand  is the more naturalistic use of colour in bodily form--pure  phantasy. Either of these alternatives may in their turn be  exaggerated. Everything is at the artist's disposal, and the  freedom of today has at once its dangers and its possibilities.  We may be present at the conception of a new great epoch, or we  may see the opportunity squandered in aimless extravagance.    [Footnote: On this question see my article \"Uber die Formfrage\"--in \"Der  Blaue Reiter\" (Piper-Verlag, 1912). Taking the work of Henri Rousseau as  a starting point, I go on to prove that the new naturalism will not only  be equivalent to but even identical with abstraction.]    That art is above nature is no new discovery. [Footnote: Cf. \"Goethe\",  by Karl Heinemann, 1899, p. 684; also Oscar Wilde, \"De Profundis\"; also  Delacroix, \"My Diary\".] New principles do not fall from heaven, but are  logically if indirectly connected with past and future. What is  important to us is the momentary position of the principle and how best  it can be used. It must not be employed forcibly. But if the artist  tunes his soul to this note, the sound will ring in his work of itself.  The \"emancipation\" of today must advance on the lines of the inner need.  It is hampered at present by external form, and as that is thrown aside,  there arises as the aim of composition-construction. The search for  constructive form has produced Cubism, in which natural form is often  forcibly subjected to geometrical construction, a process which tends to  hamper the abstract by the concrete and spoil the concrete by the  abstract.    The harmony of the new art demands a more subtle construction  than this, something that appeals less to the eye and more to the  soul. This \"concealed construction\" may arise from an apparently  fortuitous selection of forms on the canvas. Their external lack  of cohesion is their internal harmony. This haphazard arrangement  of forms may be the future of artistic harmony. Their fundamental  relationship will finally be able to be expressed in mathematical  form, but in terms irregular rather than regular.        VIII. ART AND ARTISTS        The work of art is born of the artist in a mysterious and secret  way. From him it gains life and being. Nor is its existence  casual and inconsequent, but it has a definite and purposeful  strength, alike in its material and spiritual life. It exists and  has power to create spiritual atmosphere; and from this inner  standpoint one judges whether it is a good work of art or a bad  one. If its \"form\" is bad it means that the form is too feeble in  meaning to call forth corresponding vibrations of the soul.    [Footnote: So-called indecent pictures are either incapable of  causing vibrations of the soul (in which case they are not art)  or they are so capable. In the latter case they are not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#15)"],[1,"these  first babies were raised and had flown, two more nests were built, and  two other broods flew around the sumac.  By fall the Cardinal was the  father of a small flock, and they were each one neat, trim, beautiful  river birds.    He had lived through spring with its perfumed air, pale flowers, and  burning heart hunger.  He had known summer in its golden mood, with  forests pungent with spicebush and sassafras; festooned with wild  grape, woodbine, and bittersweet; carpeted with velvet moss and starry  mandrake peeping from beneath green shades; the never-ending murmur of  the shining river; and the rich fulfilment of love's fruition.    Now it was fall, and all the promises of spring were accomplished.  The  woods were glorious in autumnal tints.  There were ripened red haws,  black haws, and wild grapes only waiting for severe frosts, nuts  rattling down, scurrying squirrels, and the rabbits' flash of gray and  brown.  The waysides were bright with the glory of goldenrod, and royal  with the purple of asters and ironwort.  There was the rustle of  falling leaves, the flitting of velvety butterflies, the whir of wings  trained southward, and the call of the king crow gathering his  followers.    Then to the Cardinal came the intuition that it was time to lead his  family to the orange orchard.  One day they flamed and rioted up and  down the shining river, raced over the corn field, and tilted on the  sumac.  The next, a black frost had stripped its antlered limbs.  Stark  and deserted it stood, a picture of loneliness.    O bird of wonderful plumage and human-like song! What a precious  thought of Divinity to create such beauty and music for our pleasure!  Brave songster of the flaming coat, too proud to hide your flashing  beauty, too fearless to be cautious of the many dangers that beset you,  from the top of the morning we greet you, and hail you King of  Birdland, at your imperious command: \"See here! See here!\""]]]
