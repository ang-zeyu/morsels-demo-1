It may be added, that not a few are chargeable with both these  faults at once. They are original, or at least anonymous, where there  should have been given other authority than that of the compiler's name;  and they are copies, or, at best, poor imitations, where the author should  have shown himself capable of writing in a good style of his own. What then  is the middle ground for the true grammarian? What is the kind, and what  the degree, of originality, which are to be commended in works of this  sort? In the first place, a grammarian must be a writer, an author, a man  who observes and thinks for himself; and not a mere compiler, abridger,  modifier, copyist, or plagiarist. Grammar is not the only subject upon  which we allow no man to innovate in doctrine; why, then, should it be the  only one upon which a man may make it a merit, to work up silently into a  book of his own, the best materials found among the instructions of his  predecessors and rivals? Some definitions and rules, which in the lapse of  time and by frequency of use have become a sort of public property, the  grammarian may perhaps be allowed to use at his pleasure; yet even upon  these a man of any genius will be apt to set some impress peculiar to  himself. But the doctrines of his work ought, in general, to be expressed  in his own language, and illustrated by that of others. With respect to  quotation, he has all the liberty of other writers, and no more; for, if a  grammarian makes \"use of his predecessors' labours,\" why should any one  think with Murray, \"it is scarcely necessary to apologize for\" this, \"or  for _omitting_ to _insert_ their names?\"--_Introd. to L. Murray's Gram._,  8vo, p. 7.    20. The author of this volume would here take the liberty briefly to refer  to his own procedure. His knowledge of what is _technical_ in grammar, was  of course chiefly derived from the writings of other grammarians; and to  their concurrent opinions and practices, he has always had great respect;  yet, in truth, not a line has he ever copied from any of them with a design  to save the labour of composition. For, not to compile an English grammar  from others already extant, but to compose one more directly from the  sources of the art, was the task which he at first proposed to himself. Nor  is there in all the present volume a single sentence, not regularly quoted,  the authorship of which he supposes may now be ascribed to an other more  properly than to himself. Where either authority or acknowledgement was  requisite, names have been inserted. In the doctrinal parts of the volume,  not only quotations from others, but most examples made for the occasion,  are marked with guillemets, to distinguish them from the main text; while,  to almost every thing which is really taken from any other known writer, a  name or reference is added. For those citations, however, which there was  occasion to repeat in different parts of the work, a single reference has  sometimes been thought sufficient. This remark refers chiefly to the  corrections in the Key, the references being given in the Exercises.    21. Though the theme is not one on which a man may hope to write well with  little reflection, it is true that the parts of this treatise which have  cost the author the most labour, are those which \"consist chiefly of  materials selected from the writings of others.\" These, however, are not  the didactical portions of the book, but the proofs and examples; which,  according to the custom of the ancient grammarians, ought to be taken from  other authors. But so much have the makers of our modern grammars been  allowed to presume upon the respect and acquiescence of their readers, that  the ancient exactness on this point would often appear pedantic. Many  phrases and sentences, either original with the writer, or common to  everybody, will therefore be found among the illustrations of the following  work; for it was not supposed that any reader would demand for every thing  of this kind the authority of some great name. Anonymous examples are  sufficient to elucidate principles, if not to establish them; and  elucidation is often the sole purpose for which an example is needed.    22. It is obvious enough, that no writer on grammar has any right to  propose himself as authority for what he teaches; for every language, being  the common property of all who use it, ought to be carefully guarded  against the caprices of individuals; and especially against that  presumption which might attempt to impose erroneous or arbitrary  definitions and rules. \"Since the matter of which we are treating,\" says  the philologist of Salamanca, \"is to be verified, first by reason, and then  by testimony and usage, none ought to wonder if we sometimes deviate from  the track of great men; for, with whatever authority any grammarian may  weigh with me, unless he shall have confirmed his assertions by reason, and  also by examples, he shall win no confidence in respect to grammar. For, as  Seneca says, Epistle 95, 'Grammarians are the _guardians_, not the  _authors_, of language.'\"--_Sanctii Minerva_, Lib. ii, Cap. 2. Yet, as what  is intuitively seen to be true or false, is already sufficiently proved or  detected, many points in grammar need nothing more than to be clearly  stated and illustrated; nay, it would seem an injurious reflection on the  understanding of the reader, to accumulate proofs of what cannot but be  evident to all who speak the language.    23. Among men of the same profession, there is an unavoidable rivalry, so  far as they become competitors for the same prize; but in competition there  is nothing dishonourable, while excellence alone obtains distinction, and  no advantage is sought by unfair means. It is evident that we ought to  account him the best grammarian, who has the most completely executed the  worthiest design. But no worthy design can need a false apology; and it is  worse than idle to prevaricate. That is but a spurious modesty, which  prompts a man to disclaim in one way what he assumes in an other--or to  underrate the duties of his office, that he may boast of having \"done all  that could reasonably be expected.\" Whoever professes to have improved the  science of English grammar, must claim to know more of the matter than the  generality of English grammarians; and he who begins with saying, that  \"little can be expected\" from the office he assumes, must be wrongfully  contradicted, when he is held to have done much. Neither the ordinary power  of speech, nor even the ability to write respectably on common topics,  makes a man a critic among critics, or enables him to judge of literary  merit. And if, by virtue of these qualifications alone, a man will become a  grammarian or a connoisseur, he can hold the rank only by courtesy--a  courtesy which is content to degrade the character, that his inferior  pretensions may be accepted and honoured under the name.    24. By the force of a late popular example, still too widely influential,  grammatical authorship has been reduced, in the view of many, to little or  nothing more than a mere serving-up of materials anonymously borrowed; and,  what is most remarkable, even for an indifferent performance of this low  office, not only unnamed reviewers, but several writers of note, have not  scrupled to bestow the highest praise of grammatical excellence! And thus  the palm of superior skill in grammar, has been borne away by a _professed  compiler_; who had so mean an opinion of what his theme required, as to  deny it even the common courtesies of compilation! What marvel is it, that,  under the wing of such authority, many writers have since sprung up, to  improve upon this most happy design; while all who were competent to the  task, have been discouraged from attempting any thing like a complete  grammar of our language? What motive shall excite a man to long-continued  diligence, where such notions prevail as give mastership no hope of  preference, and where the praise of his ingenuity and the reward of his  labour must needs be inconsiderable, till some honoured compiler usurp them  both, and bring his \"most useful matter\" before the world under better  auspices? If the love of learning supply such a motive, who that has  generously yielded to the impulse, will not now, like Johnson, feel himself  reduced to an \"humble drudge\"--or, like Perizonius, apologize for the  apparent folly of devoting his time to such a subject as grammar?    25. The first edition of the \"Institutes of English Grammar,\" the doctrinal  parts of which are embraced in the present more copious work, was published  in the year 1823; since which time, (within the space of twelve years,)  about forty new compends, mostly professing to be abstracts of _Murray_,  with improvements, have been added to our list of English grammars. The  author has examined as many as thirty of them, and seen advertisements of  perhaps a dozen more. Being various in character, they will of course be  variously estimated; but, so far as he can judge, they are, without  exception, works of little or no real merit, and not likely to be much  patronized or long preserved from oblivion. For which reason, he would have  been inclined entirely to disregard the petty depredations which the  writers of several of them have committed upon his earlier text, were it  not possible, that by such a frittering-away of his work, he himself might  one day seem to some to have copied that from others which was first taken  from him. Trusting to make it manifest to men of learning, that in the  production of the books which bear his name, far more has been done for the  grammar of our language than any single hand had before achieved within the  scope of practical philology, and that with perfect fairness towards other  writers; he cannot but feel a wish that the integrity of his text should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#16)"],[1,"ability, he  could not make me love him. I'm not a child. I saw through him in the  first hour. There's not enough in him to win my love. I'll show him I  think no more of him than of the caterpillars on the old tree there. I'm  not a booby that will fall in love with every gussie I see. Bah, there's  no fear of that! I hate and detest men!\"    \"I suppose you are rehearsing some more airs to show off with tonight,\"  sneered a voice behind me.    \"No, I'm realisticing; and how _dare_ you thrust your obnoxious presence  before me when I wish to be alone! Haven't I often shown--\"    \"While a girl is disengaged, any man who is her equal has the right to  pay his addresses to her if he is in earnest,\" interrupted Mr Hawden. It  was he who stood before me.    \"I am well aware of that,\" I replied. \"But it is a woman's privilege to  repel those attentions if distasteful to her. You seem disinclined to  accord me that privilege.\"    Having delivered this retort, I returned to the house, leaving him  standing there looking the fool he was.    I do not believe in spurning the love of a blackfellow if he behaves in  a manly way; but Frank Hawden was such a drivelling mawkish style of  sweetheart that I had no patience with him.    Aunt Helen and Everard had vacated the drawing-room, so I plumped down  on the piano-stool and dashed into Kowalski's galop, from that into  \"Gaite de Coeur\" until I made the piano dance and tremble like a thing  possessed. My annoyance faded, and I slowly played that saddest of  waltzes, \"Weber's Last\". I became aware of a presence in the room, and,  facing about, confronted Everard Grey.    \"How long have you been here?\" I demanded sharply.    \"Since you began to play. Where on earth did you learn to play? Your  execution is splendid. Do sing 'Three Fishers', please.\"    \"Excuse me; I haven't time now. Besides I am not competent to sing to  you,\" I said brusquely, and made my exit.    \"Mr Hawden wants you, Sybylla,\" called aunt Helen. \"See what he wants  and let him get away to his work, or your grannie will be vexed to see  him loitering about all the morning.\"    \"Miss Sybylla,\" he began, when we were left alone, \"I want to apologize  to you. I had no right to plague you, but it all comes of the way I love  you. A fellow gets jealous at the least little thing, you know.\"    \"Bore me with no more such trash,\" I said, turning away in disgust.    \"But, Miss Sybylla, what am I to do with it?\"    \"Do with what?\"    \"My love.\"    \"Love!\" I retorted scornfully. \"There is no such thing.\"    \"But there is, and I have found it.\"    \"Well, you stick to it--that's my advice to you. It will be a treasure.  If you send it to my father he will get it bottled up and put it in the  Goulburn museum. He has sent several things there already.\"    \"Don't make such a game of a poor devil. You know I can't do that.\"    \"Bag it up, then; put a big stone to make it sink, and pitch it in the  river.\"    \"You'll rue this,\" he said savagely.    \"I may or may not,\" I sang over my shoulder as I departed.          CHAPTER TWELVE    One Grand Passion      I had not the opportunity of any more private interviews with Everard  Grey till one morning near his departure, when we happened to be alone  on the veranda.    \"Well, Miss Sybylla,\" he began, \"when I arrived I thought you and I  would have been great friends; but we have not progressed at all. How do  you account for that?\"    As he spoke he laid his slender shapely hand kindly upon my head. He was  very handsome and winning, and moved in literary, musical, and artistic  society--a man from my world, a world away.    Oh, what pleasure I might have derived from companionship with him! I  bit my lip to keep back the tears. Why did not social arrangements allow  a man and a maid to be chums--chums as two men or two maids may be to  each other, enjoying each other without thought beyond pure platonic  friendship? But no; it could not be. I understood the conceit of men.  Should I be very affable, I feared Everard Grey would imagine he had  made a conquest of me. On the other hand, were I glum he would think the  same, and that I was trying to hide my feelings behind a mask of  brusquerie. I therefore steered in a bee-line between the two manners,  and remarked with the greatest of indifference:    \"I was not aware that you expected us to be such cronies--in fact, I  have never given the matter a thought.\"    He turned away in a piqued style. Such a beau of beaux, no doubt he was  annoyed that an insignificant little country bumpkin should not be  flattered by his patronage, or probably he thought me rude or  ill-humoured.    Two mornings later uncle Jay-Jay took him to Gool-Gool _en route_ for  Sydney. When departing he bade me a kindly good-bye, made me promise to  write to him, and announced his intention of obtaining the opinion of  some good masters re my dramatic talent and voice, when I came to Sydney  as promised by my grandmother. I stood on the garden fence waving my  handkerchief until the buggy passed out of sight among the  messmate-trees about half a mile from the house.    \"Well I hope, as that dandified ape has gone--and good riddance to  him--that you will pay more heed to my attentions now,\" said Mr Hawden's  voice, as I was in the act of descending from the fence.    \"What do you mean by your attentions?\" I demanded.    \"What do I mean! That is something like coming to business. I'll soon  explain. You know what my intentions are very well. When I am  twenty-four, I will come into my property in England. It is  considerable, and at the end of that time I want to marry you and take  you home. By Jove! I would just like to take you home. You'd surprise  some English girls I know.\"    \"There would be more than one person surprised if I married you,\" I  thought to myself, and laughed till I ached with the motion.    \"You infernal little vixen! What are you laughing at? You've got no more  sense than a bat if such a solemn thing only provokes your mirth.\"    \"Solemn--why, it's a screaming farce!\" I laughed more and more.    \"What's a farce?\" he demanded fiercely.    \"The bare idea of you proposing to me.\"    \"Why? Have I not as much right to propose as any other man?\"    \"Man!\" I laughed. \"That's where the absurdity arises. My child, if you  were a man, certainly you could propose, but do you think I'd look at a  boy, a child! If ever I perpetrate matrimony the participant in my  degradation will be a fully developed man--not a hobbledehoy who falls  in love, as he terms it, on an average about twice a week. Love! Ho!\"    I moved in the direction of the house. He barred my path.    \"You are not going to escape me like that, my fine lady. I will make you  listen to me this time or you will hear more about it,\" and he seized me  angrily by the wrist.    I cannot bear the touch of any one--it is one of my idiosyncrasies. With  my disengaged hand I struck him a vigorous blow on the nose, and  wrenching myself free sprang away, saying, \"How dare you lay a finger on  me! If you attempt such a thing again I'll make short work of you. Mark  my words, or you'll get something more than a bleeding nose next time, I  promise you.\"    \"You'll hear more of this! You'll hear more of this! You fierce, wild,  touch-me-not thing,\" he roared.    \"Yes; my motto with men is touch-me-not, and it is your own fault if I'm  fierce. If children attempt to act the role of a man with adult tools,  they are sure to cut themselves. Hold hard a bit, honey, till your  whiskers grow,\" I retorted as I departed, taking flying leaps over the  blossom-burdened flower-beds.    At tea that night, after gazing interestedly at Mr Hawden's nose for  some time, uncle Julius inquired, \"in the name of all that's mysterious,  what the devil have you been doing to your nose? You look as though you  had been on the spree.\"    I was quaking lest he would get me into a fine scrape, but he only  muttered, \"By Jove!\" with great energy, and glowered menacingly across  the table at me.    After tea he requested an interview with grannie, which aroused my  curiosity greatly. I was destined to hear all about it next morning.  When breakfast was over grannie called me into her room and interviewed  me about Mr Hawden's interview. She began without any preliminaries:    \"Mr Hawden has complained of your conduct. It grieves me that any young  man should have to speak to me of the behaviour of my own  grand-daughter. He says you have been flirting with him. Sybylla, I  scarcely thought you would be so immodest and unwomanly.\"    On hearing this my thoughts of Frank Hawden were the reverse of  flattering. He had persecuted me beyond measure, yet I had not deigned  to complain of him to either uncle, grannie, or auntie, as I might  reasonably have done, and have obtained immediate redress. He had been  the one to blame in the case, yet for the rebuffs he had brought upon  himself, went tattling to my grandmother.    \"Is that all you have to say, grannie?\"    \"No. He wants to marry you, and has asked my consent. I told him it all  rested with yourself and parents. What do you say?\"    \"Say,\" I exclaimed, \"grannie, you are only joking, are you not?\"    \"No, my child, this is not a matter to joke about.\"    \"Marry that creature! A boy!\" I uttered in consternation.    \"He is no boy. He has attained his majority some months. He is as old as  your grandfather was when we married. In three years you will be almost  twenty, and by that time he will be in possession of his property which  is very good--in fact, he will be quite rich. If you care for him there  is nothing against him as I can see. He is healthy, has a good  character, and comes of a high family. Being a bit wild won't matter.  Very often, after they sow their wild oats, some of those scampy young  fellows settle down and marry a nice young girl and turn out very good  husbands.\"    \"It is disgusting, and you ought to be downright ashamed of yourself,  grannie!"]]]
