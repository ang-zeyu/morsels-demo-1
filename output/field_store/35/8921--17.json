[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#15)"],[1,"p--and you win the bet!\"    Vance shook his head as though in protest and struck his hand across his  face. He dared not let her see the joy that contorted his features.  Triumph here on the very verge of defeat! It misted his eyes. Joy gave  wings to his thoughts. He was the master of the valley.    \"But--you'll think before you do anything, Elizabeth?\"    \"I've done my thinking already--twenty-four years of it. I'm going to do  what I promised I'd do.\"    \"And that?\"    \"You'll see and hear in time. What's yonder?\"    The men were rising, one after another, and bunching together. Before  Vance could answer, there was a confusion in the hall, running feet here  and there. They heard the hard, shrill voice of Wu Chi chattering  directions and the guttural murmurs of his fellow servants as they  answered. Someone ran out into the hall and came back to the huddling,  stirring crowd in the living room.    \"He's not dead--but close to it. Maybe die any minute--maybe live through  it!\"    That was the report.    \"We'll get young Hollis and hold him to see how the sheriff comes out.\"    \"Aye, we'll get him!\"    All at once they boiled into action and the little crowd of men thrust  for the big doors that led into the hall. They cast the doors back and  came directly upon the tall, white-headed figure of Gainor.        CHAPTER 15      Gainor's dignity split the force of their rush. They recoiled as water  strikes on a rock and divides into two meager swirls. And when one or two  went past him on either side, he recalled them.    \"Boys, there seems to be a little game on hand. What is it?\"    Something repelling, coldly inquiring in his attitude and in his voice.  They would have gone on if they could, but they could not. He held them  with a force of knowledge of things that they did not know. They were  remembering that this man had gone out with the sheriff to meet,  apparently, his death. And yet Gainor, a well-tried friend of the  sheriff, seemed unexcited. They had to answer his question, and how could  they lie when he saw them rushing through a door with revolvers coming to  brown, skillful hands? It was someone from the rear who made the  confession.    \"We're going to get young Black Jack!\"    That was it. The speech came out like the crack of a gun, clearing the  atmosphere. It told every man exactly what was in his own mind, felt but  not confessed. They had no grudge against Terry, really. But they were  determined to hang the son of Black Jack. Had it been a lesser deed, they  might have let him go. But his victim was too distinguished in their  society. He had struck down Joe Minter; the ghost of the great Black Jack  himself seemed to have stalked out among them.    \"You're going to get young Terry Hollis?\" interpreted Gainor, and his  voice rose and rang over them. Those who had slipped past him on either  side came back and faced him. In the distance Elizabeth had not stirred.  Vance kept watching her face. It was cold as ice, unreadable. He could  not believe that she was allowing this lynching party to organize under  her own roof--a lynching party aimed at Terence. It began to grow in him  that he had gained a greater victory than he imagined.    \"If you aim at Terry,\" went on Gainor, his voice even louder, \"you'll  have to aim at me, too. There's going to be no lynching bee, my friends!\"    The women had crowded back in the room. They made a little bank of stir  and murmur around Elizabeth.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Gainor, shaking his white hair back again in his  imposing way, \"there has been no murder. The sheriff is not going to die.  There has been a disagreement between two men of honor. The sheriff is  now badly wounded. I think that is all. Does anybody want to ask  questions about what has happened?\"    There was a bustle in the group of men. They were putting  away the weapons, not quite sure what they could do next.    \"I am going to tell you exactly what has happened,\" said Gainor. \"You  heard the unfortunate things that passed at the table today. What the  sheriff said was not said as an insult; but under the circumstances it  became necessary for Terence Hollis to resent what he had heard. As a man  of honor he could not do otherwise. You all agree with me in that?\"    They grunted a grudging assent. There were ways and ways of looking at  such things. The way of Gainor was a generation old. But there was  something so imposing about the old fellow, something which breathed the  very spirit of honor and fair play, that they could not argue the point.    \"Accordingly Mr. Hollis sent for the sheriff. Not to bring him outdoors  and shoot him down in a sudden gunplay, nor to take advantage of him  through a surprise--as a good many men would have been tempted to do, my  friends, for the sheriff has a wide reputation as a handler of guns of  all sorts. No, sir, he sent for me also, and he told us frankly that the  bad blood between him and the sheriff must be spent. You understand? By  the Lord, my friends, I admired the fine spirit of the lad. He expected  to be shot rather than to drop the sheriff. I could tell that by his  expression. But his eye did not falter. It carried me back to the old  days--to old days, sirs!\"    There was not a murmur in the entire room. The eye of Elizabeth Cornish  was fire. Whether with anger or pride, Vance could not tell. But he began  to worry.    \"We went over to the group of silver spruce near the house. I gave them  the directions. They came and stood together, back to back, with their  revolvers not drawn. They began to walk away in opposite directions at my  command.    \"When I called 'Turn,' they wheeled. My gun was ready to shoot down the  first man guilty of foul play--but there was no attempt to turn too soon,  before the signal. They whirled, snatching out their guns--and the  revolver of the sheriff hung in his clothes!\"    A groan from the little crowd.    \"Although, upon my word,\" said Gainor, \"I do not think that the sheriff  could have possibly brought out his gun as swiftly as Terence Hollis did.  His whirl was like the spin of a top, or the snap of a whiplash, and as  he snapped about, the revolver was in his hand, not raised to draw a  bead, but at his hip. The sheriff set his teeth--but Terry did not fire!\"    A bewildered murmur from the crowd.    \"No, my friends,\" cried Gainor, his voice quivering, \"he did not fire. He  dropped the muzzle of his gun--and waited. By heaven, my heart went out  to him. It was magnificent.\"    The thin, strong hand of Elizabeth closed on the arm of Vance. \"That was  a Colby who did that!\" she whispered.    \"The sheriff gritted his teeth,\" went on Gainor, \"and tore out his gun.  All this pause had been such a space as is needed for an eyelash to  flicker twice. Out shot the sheriff's Colt. And then, and not until then,  did the muzzle of Terry's revolver jerk up. Even after that delay he beat  the sheriff to the trigger. The two shots came almost together, but the  sheriff was already falling when he pulled his trigger, and his aim was  wild.    \"He dropped on one side, the revolver flying out of his hand. I started  forward, and then I stopped. By heaven, the sheriff had stretched out his  arm and picked up his gun again. He was not through fighting.    \"A bulldog spirit, you say? Yes! And what could I do? It was the  sheriff's right to keep on fighting as long as he wished. And it was the  right of Terence to shoot the man full of holes the minute his hand  touched the revolver again.    \"I could only stand still. I saw the sheriff raise his revolver. It was  an effort of agony. But he was still trying to kill. And I nerved myself  and waited for the explosion of the gun of Terence. I say I nerved myself  for that shock, but the gun did not explode. I looked at him in wonder.  My friends, he was putting up his gun and quietly looking the sheriff in  the eye!    \"At that I shouted to him, I don't know what. I shouted to the sheriff  not to fire. Too late. The muzzle of the gun was already tilting up, the  barrel was straightening. And then the gun fell from Minter's hand and he  dropped on his side. His strength had failed him at the last moment.    \"But I say, sirs, that what Terence Hollis did was the finest thing I  have ever seen in my life, and I have seen fine things done by gentlemen  before. There may be unpleasant associations with the name of Terry's  father. I, for one, shall never carry over those associations to the son.  Never! He has my hand, my respect, my esteem in every detail. He is a  gentleman, my friends! There is nothing for us to do. If the sheriff is  unfortunate and the wound should prove fatal, Terence will give himself  up to the law. If he lives, he will be the first to tell you to keep your  hands off the boy!\"    He ended in a little silence. But there was no appreciative burst of  applause from those who heard him. The fine courage of Terence was, to  them, merely the iron nerve of the man-killer, the keen eye and the  judicious mind which knew that the sheriff would collapse before he fired  his second shot. And his courtesy before the first shot was simply the  surety of the man who knew that no matter what advantage he gave to his  enemy, his own speed of hand would more than make up for it.    Gainor, reading their minds, paid no more heed to them. He went straight  across the room and took the hand of Elizabeth.    \"Dear Miss Cornish,\" he said so that all could hear, \"I congratulate you  for the man you have given us in Terence Hollis.\"    Vance, watching, saw the tears of pleasure brighten the eyes of his  sister.    \"You are very kind,\" she said. \"But now I must see Sheriff Minter and be  sure that everything is done for him.\"    It seemed that the party took this as a signal for dismissal. As she went  across the room, there were a dozen hasty adieus, and soon the guests  were streaming towards the doors.    Vance and Elizabeth and Gainor went to the sheriff. He had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#15)"],[1,"if they're beautiful an' fiery, bent  on havin' their way, as this new lass is, all hell couldn't hold a  candle to them. We don't need the Shawnees an' Girtys, an' hoss  thieves round this here settlement to stir up excitin' times, now  we've got this dark-eyed lass. An' yet any fool could see she's sweet,  an' good, an' true as gold.\"    Toward the middle of the afternoon Jonathan sauntered in the direction  of Metzar's inn. It lay on the front of the bluff, with its main doors  looking into the road. A long, one-story log structure with two doors,  answered as a bar-room. The inn proper was a building more  pretentious, and joined the smaller one at its western end. Several  horses were hitched outside, and two great oxen yoked to a cumbersome  mud-crusted wagon stood patiently by.    Jonathan bent his tall head as he entered the noisy bar-room. The  dingy place reeked with tobacco smoke and the fumes of vile liquor. It  was crowded with men. The lawlessness of the time and place was  evident. Gaunt, red-faced frontiersmen reeled to and fro across the  sawdust floor; hunters and fur-traders, raftsmen and farmers, swelled  the motley crowd; young men, honest-faced, but flushed and wild with  drink, hung over the bar; a group of sullen-visaged, serpent-eyed  Indians held one corner. The black-bearded proprietor dealt out  the rum.    From beyond the bar-room, through a door entering upon the back porch,  came the rattling of dice. Jonathan crossed the bar-room apparently  oblivious to the keen glance Metzar shot at him, and went out upon the  porch. This also was crowded, but there was more room because of  greater space. At one table sat some pioneers drinking and laughing;  at another were three men playing with dice. Colonel Zane, Silas, and  Sheppard were among the lookers-on at the game. Jonathan joined them,  and gazed at the gamesters.    Brandt he knew well enough; he had seen that set, wolfish expression  in the riverman's face before. He observed, however, that the man had  flushed cheeks and trembling hands, indications of hard drinking. The  player sitting next to Brandt was Williams, one of the garrison, and a  good-natured fellow, but garrulous and wickedly disposed when drunk.  The remaining player Jonathan at once saw was the Englishman,  Mordaunt. He was a handsome man, with fair skin, and long, silken,  blond mustache. Heavy lines, and purple shades under his blue eyes,  were die unmistakable stamp of dissipation. Reckless, dissolute, bad  as he looked, there yet clung something favorable about the man.  Perhaps it was his cool, devil-may-care way as he pushed over gold  piece after gold piece from the fast diminishing pile before him. His  velvet frock and silken doublet had once been elegant; but were now  sadly the worse for border roughing.    Behind the Englishman's chair Jonathan saw a short man with a face  resembling that of a jackal. The grizzled, stubbly beard, the  protruding, vicious mouth, the broad, flat nose, and deep-set, small,  glittering eyes made a bad impression on the observer. This man,  Jonathan concluded, was the servant, Case, who was so eager with his  knife. The borderman made the reflection, that if knife-play was the  little man's pastime, he was not likely to go short of sport in  that vicinity.    Colonel Zane attracted Jonathan's attention at this moment. The  pioneers had vacated the other table, and Silas and Sheppard now sat  by it. The colonel wanted his brother to join them.    \"Here, Johnny, bring drinks,\" he said to the serving boy. \"Tell Metzar  who they're for.\" Then turning to Sheppard he continued: \"He keeps  good whiskey; but few of these poor devils ever see it.\" At the same  time Colonel Zane pressed his foot upon that of Jonathan's.    The borderman understood that the signal was intended to call  attention to Brandt. The latter had leaned forward, as Jonathan passed  by to take a seat with his brother, and said something in a low tone  to Mordaunt and Case. Jonathan knew by the way the Englishman and his  man quickly glanced up at him, that he had been the subject of  the remark.    Suddenly Williams jumped to his feet with an oath.    \"I'm cleaned out,\" he cried.    \"Shall we play alone?\" asked Brandt of Mordaunt.    \"As you like,\" replied the Englishman, in a tone which showed he cared  not a whit whether he played or not.    \"I've got work to do. Let's have some more drinks, and play another  time,\" said Brandt.    The liquor was served and drank. Brandt pocketed his pile of Spanish  and English gold, and rose to his feet. He was a trifle unsteady; but  not drunk.    \"Will you gentlemen have a glass with me?\" Mordaunt asked of Colonel  Zane's party.    \"Thank you, some other time, with pleasure. We have our drink now,\"  Colonel Zane said courteously.    Meantime Brandt had been whispering in Case's ear. The little man  laughed at something the riverman said. Then he shuffled from behind  the table. He was short, his compact build gave promise of unusual  strength and agility.    \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Mordaunt, rising also. He looked  hard at Case.    \"Shiver my sides, cap'n, if I don't need another drink,\" replied the  sailor.    \"You have had enough. Come upstairs with me,\" said Mordaunt.    \"Easy with your hatch, cap'n,\" grinned Case. \"I want to drink with  that ther' Injun killer. I've had drinks with buccaneers, and bad men  all over the world, and I'm not going to miss this chance.\"    \"Come on; you will get into trouble. You must not annoy these  gentlemen,\" said Mordaunt.    \"Trouble is the name of my ship, and she's a trim, fast craft,\"  replied the man.    His loud voice had put an end to the convention. Men began to crowd in  from the bar-room. Metzar himself came to see what had caused the  excitement.    The little man threw up his cap, whooped, and addressed himself to  Jonathan:    \"Injun-killer, bad man of the border, will you drink with a jolly old  tar from England?\"    Suddenly a silence reigned, like that in the depths of the forest. To  those who knew the borderman, and few did not know him, the invitation  was nothing less than an insult. But it did not appear to them, as to  him, like a pre-arranged plot to provoke a fight.    \"Will you drink, redskin-hunter?\" bawled the sailor.    \"No,\" said Jonathan in his quiet voice.    \"Maybe you mean that against old England?\" demanded Case fiercely.    The borderman eyed him steadily, inscrutable as to feeling or intent,  and was silent.    \"Go out there and I'll see the color of your insides quicker than I'd  take a drink,\" hissed the sailor, with his brick-red face distorted  and hideous to look upon. He pointed with a long-bladed knife that no  one had seen him draw, to the green sward beyond the porch.    The borderman neither spoke, nor relaxed a muscle.    \"Ho! ho! my brave pirate of the plains!\" cried Case, and he leered  with braggart sneer into the faces of Jonathan and his companions.    It so happened that Sheppard sat nearest to him, and got the full  effect of the sailor's hot, rum-soaked breath. He arose with a  pale face.    \"Colonel, I can't stand this,\" he said hastily. \"Let's get away from  that drunken ruffian.\"    \"Who's a drunken ruffian?\" yelled Case, more angry than ever. \"I'm not  drunk; but I'm going to be, and cut some of you white-livered border  mates. Here, you old masthead, drink this to my health, damn you!\"    The ruffian had seized a tumbler of liquor from the table, and held it  toward Sheppard while he brandished his long knife.    White as snow, Sheppard backed against the wall; but did not take the  drink.    The sailor had the floor; no one save him spoke a word. The action had  been so rapid that there had hardly been time. Colonel Zane and Silas  were as quiet and tense as the borderman.    \"Drink!\" hoarsely cried the sailor, advancing his knife toward  Sheppard's body.    When the sharp point all but pressed against the old man, a bright  object twinkled through the air. It struck Case's wrist, knocked the  knife from his fingers, and, bounding against the wall, fell upon the  floor. It was a tomahawk.    The borderman sprang over the table like a huge catamount, and with  movement equally quick, knocked Case with a crash against the wall;  closed on him before he could move a hand, and flung him like a sack  of meal over the bluff.    The tension relieved, some of the crowd laughed, others looked over  the embankment to see how Case had fared, and others remarked that for  some reason he had gotten off better than they expected.    The borderman remained silent. He leaned against a post, with broad  breast gently heaving, but his eyes sparkled as they watched Brandt,  Williams, Mordaunt and Metzar. The Englishman alone spoke.    \"Handily done,\" he said, cool and suave. \"Sir, yours is an iron hand.  I apologize for this unpleasant affair. My man is quarrelsome when  under the influence of liquor.\"    \"Metzar, a word with you,\" cried Colonel Zane curtly.    \"Come inside, kunnel,\" said the innkeeper, plainly ill at ease.    \"No; listen here. I'll speak to the point. You've got to stop running  this kind of a place. No words, now, you've got to stop. Understand?  You know as well as I, perhaps better, the character of your so-called  inn. You'll get but one more chance.\"    \"Wal, kunnel, this is a free country,\" growled Metzar. \"I can't help  these fellars comin' here lookin' fer blood. I runs an honest place.  The men want to drink an' gamble. What's law here? What can you do?\"    \"You know me, Metzar,\" Colonel Zane said grimly. \"I don't waste words.  'To hell with law!' so you say. I can say that, too. Remember, the  next drunken boy I see, or shady deal, or gambling spree, out you go  for good.\"    Metzar lowered his shaggy head and left the porch. Brandt and his  friends, with serious faces, withdrew into the bar-room.    The borderman walked around the corner of the inn, and up the lane.  The colonel, with Silas and "]]]
