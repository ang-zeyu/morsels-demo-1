[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#15)"],[1,"s, some of whom, as Julius Caesar (to whom  Tacitus particularly refers, 28), were themselves the chief actors in  what they relate. These authors, some of whose contributions to the  history of Germany are now lost (e.g. the elder Pliny, who wrote twenty  books on the German wars), must have all been in the hands of Tacitus,  and were, doubtless, consulted by him; not, however, as a servile  copyist, or mere compiler (for he sometimes differs from his authorities,  from Caesar even, whom he declares to be the best of them), but as a  discriminating and judicious inquirer. The account of German customs and  institutions may, therefore, be relied on, from the intrinsic credibility  of the author. It receives confirmation, also, from its general  accordance with other early accounts of the Germans, and with their  better known subsequent history, as well as from its strong analogy to  the well-known habits of our American aborigines, and other tribes in a  like stage of civilization (cf. note, ยง 15). The geographical details are  composed with all the accuracy which the ever-shifting positions and  relations of warring and wandering tribes rendered possible in the nature  of the case (cf. note, ยง 28). In sentiment, the treatise is surpassingly  rich and instructive, like all the works of this prince of philosophical  historians. In style, it is concise and nervous, yet quite rhetorical,  and in parts, even poetical to a fault (see notes passim, cf. also,  Monboddo's critique on the style of Tacitus). \"The work,\" says La  Bletterie, \"is brief without being superficial. Within the compass of a  few pages, it comprises more of ethics and politics, more fine  delineations of character, more substance and pith (_suc_), than can be  collected from many a ponderous volume. It is not one of those barely  agreeable descriptions, which gradually diffuse their influence over  the soul, and leave it in undisturbed tranquillity. It is a picture in  strong light, like the subject itself, full of fire, of sentiment, of  lightning-flashes, that go at once to the heart. We imagine ourselves  in Germany; we become familiar with these so-called barbarians; we pardon  their faults, and almost their vices, out of regard to their virtues; and  in our moments of enthusiasm, we even wish we were Germans.\"    The following remarks of Murphy will illustrate the value of the  treatise, to modern Europeans and their descendants. \"It is a draught of  savage manners, delineated by a masterly hand; the more interesting, as  the part of the world which it describes was the seminary of the modern  European nations, the VAGINA GENTIUM, as historians have emphatically  called it. The work is short but, as Montesquieu observes, it is the work  of a man who abridged every thing, because he knew every thing. A  thorough knowledge of the transactions of barbarous ages, will throw more  light than is generally imagined on the laws of modern times. Wherever  the barbarians, who issued from their northern hive, settled in new  habitations, they carried with them their native genius, their original  manners, and the first rudiments of the political system which has  prevailed in different parts of Europe. They established monarchy and  liberty, subordination and freedom, the prerogative of the prince and the  rights of the subject, all united in so bold a combination, that the  fabric, in some places, stands to this hour the wonder of mankind. The  British constitution, says Montesquieu, came out of the woods of Germany.  What the state of this country (Britain) was before the arrival of our  Saxon ancestors, Tacitus has shown in the life of Agricola. If we add to  his account of the Germans and Britons, what has been transmitted to us,  concerning them, by Julius Caesar, we shall see the origin of the  Anglo-Saxon government, the great outline of that Gothic constitution  under which the people enjoy their rights and liberties at this hour.  Montesquieu, speaking of his own country, declares it impossible to form  an adequate notion of the French monarchy, and the changes of their  government, without a previous inquiry into the manners, genius, and  spirit of the German nations. Much of what was incorporated with the  institutions of those fierce invaders, has flowed down in the stream of  time, and still mingles with our modern jurisprudence. The subject, it is  conceived, is interesting to every Briton. In the manners of the Germans,  the reader will see our present frame of government, as it were, in its  cradle, _gentis cunabula nostrae_! in the Germans themselves, a fierce  and warlike people, to whom this country owes that spirit of liberty,  which, through so many centuries, has preserved our excellent form of  government, and raised the glory of the British nation:             ------Genus unde Latinum,      Albanique patres, atque altae      moenia Romae.\"      CHAP. I. _Germania_ stands first as the emphatic word, and is followed by  _omnis_ for explanation. _Germania omnis_ here does not include Germania  Prima and Secunda, which were Roman provinces on the left bank of the  Rhine (so called because settled by Germans). It denotes _Germany  proper_, as a _whole_, in distinction from the provinces just mentioned  and from the several tribes, of which Tacitus treats in the latter part  of the work. So Caesar (B.G. 1,1) uses _Gallia omnis_, as exclusive of  the Roman provinces called Gaul and inclusive of the three _parts_, which  he proceeds to specify.    _Gallis--Pannoniis_. People used for the countries. Cf. His. 5,6:  _Phoenices. Gaul_, now France; _Rhaetia_, the country of the Grisons and  the Tyrol, with part of Bavaria; _Pannonia_, lower Hungary and part of  Austria. Germany was separated from Gaul by the Rhine; from Rhaetia and  Pannonia, by the Danube.--_Rheno et Danubio_. Rhine and Rhone are  probably different forms of the same root (Rh-n). Danube, in like manner,  has the same root as Dnieper (Dn-p); perhaps also the same as Don and  Dwina (D-n). Probably each of these roots was originally a generic name  for river, water, stream. So there are several _Avons_ in England and  Scotland. Cf. Latham's Germania sub voc.    _Sarmatis Dacisque_. The Slavonic Tribes were called Sarmatians by the  ancients. _Sarmatia_ included the country north of the Carpathian  Mountains, between the Vistula and the Don in Europe, together with the  adjacent part of Asia, without any definite limits towards the north,  which was terra incognita to the ancients--in short, Sarmatia was  _Russia_, as far as known at that time. _Dacia_ lay between the  Carpathian mountains on the north, and the Danube on the south, including  Upper Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia.    _Mutuo metu_. Rather a poetical boundary! Observe also the alliteration.  At the same time, the words are not a bad description of those wide and  solitary wastes, which, as Caesar informs us (B.G. 6, 23), the Germans  delighted to interpose between themselves and other nations, so that it  might appear that _no one dared to dwell near them.--Montibus_. The  Carpathian.--_Cetera_. Ceteram Germaniae partem.    _Sinus_. This word denotes any thing with a curved outline (cf. 29, also  A. 23); hence bays, peninsulas, and prominent bends or borders, whether  of land or water. Here _peninsulas_ (particularly that of Jutland, now  Denmark), for it is to the author's purpose here to speak of land rather  than water, and the ocean is more properly said to _embrace peninsulas_,  than _gulfs_ and _bays_. Its association with _islands_ here favors the  same interpretation. So Passow, Or., Rit. Others, with less propriety,  refer it to the _gulfs_ and _bays_, which so mark the Baltic and the  German Oceans.--_Oceanus_ here, includes both the Baltic Sea, and the  German Ocean (Oceanus Septentrionalis).    _Insularum--spatia. Islands of vast extent_, viz. Funen, Zealand, &c.  Scandinavia also (now Sweden and Norway) was regarded by the ancients as  an island, cf. Plin. Nat. His. iv. 27: quarum (insularum) clarissima  Scandinavia est, incompertae magnitudinis.    _Nuper--regibus_. Understand with this clause _ut compertum est_. The  above mentioned features of the Northern Ocean had been _discovered_  in the prosecution of the late wars, of the Romans, among the tribes  and kings previously unknown. _Nuper_ is to be taken in a general  sense==recentioribus temporibus, cf. _nuper additum_, ยง 2, where it goes  back one hundred and fifty years to the age of Julius Caesar.--_Bellum_.  War in general, no particular war.--_Versus_. This word has been  considered by some as an adverb, and by others as a preposition. It is  better however to regard it as a participle, like _ortus_, with which it  is connected, though without a conjunction expressed. Ritter omits _in_.    _Molli et clementer edito. Of gentle slope and moderate elevation_ in  studied antithesis to _inaccesso ac praecipiti, lofty and steep_. In like  manner, _jugo, ridge, summit_, is contrasted with _vertice, peak,  height_, cf. Virg. Ecl. 9, 7: _molli clivo_; Ann. 17, 38: _colles  clementer assurgentes_. The _Rhaetian_ Alps, now the mountains of the  Grisons. _Alp_ is a Celtic word==hill. _Albion_ has the same root==_hilly  country. Mons Abnoba_ (al. Arnoba) is the northern part of the  Schwartzwald, or Black Forest.--_Erumpat_, al. erumpit. But the best MSS.  and all the recent editions have _erumpat_: and Tacitus never uses the  pres. ind. after _donec, until_, cf. Rup. & Rit. in loc. Whenever he uses  the present after _donec, until_, he seems to have conceived the relation  of the two clauses, which it connects, as that of a means to an end, or a  condition to a result, and hence to have used the subj. cf. chap. 20:  _separet_; 31: _absolvat_; 35: _sinuetur_; Ann. 2, 6: _misceatur_. The  two examples last cited, like this, describe the course of a river and  boundary line. For the general rule of the modes after _donec_, see H.  522; Z."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#15)"],[1,"========================    Mr. B. acting as secretary of this meeting, will say aye;--those  opposed will say no.\"  If the motion is lost the question is put on Mr.  C., and so on, till some one is elected.  In large meetings the  secretary takes his seat near the chairman:  he should in all cases keep  a record of the proceedings as described in Sec. 51.    (b) Adoption of Resolutions.  These two officers are all that are  usually necessary for a meeting; so, when the secretary is elected, the  chairman asks, \"What is the further pleasure of the meeting?\"  If the  meeting is merely a public assembly called together to consider some  special subject, it is customary at this stage of the proceedings for  some one to offer a series of resolutions previously prepared, or else  to move the appointment of a committee to prepare resolutions upon the  subject.  In the first case he rises and says, \"Mr.  Chairman;\" the  chairman responds, \"Mr. C.\"  Mr. C., having thus obtained the floor,  then says, \"I move the adoption of the following resolutions,\" which he  then reads and hands to the chairman;* [The practice in legislative  bodies, is to send to the clerk's desk all resolutions, bills, etc., the  title of the bill and the name of the member introducing it, being  endorsed on each.  In such bodies, however, there are several clerks and  only one chairman.  In many assemblies there is but one clerk or  secretary, and, as he has to keep the minutes, there is no reason for  his being constantly interrupted to read every resolution offered. In  such assemblies, without there is a rule or established custom to the  contrary, it is allowable, and frequently much better, to hand all  resolutions, reports, etc., directly to the chairman.  If they were read  by the member introducing them, and no one calls for another reading,  the chairman can omit reading them when be thinks they are fully  understood.  In reference to the manner of reading and stating the  question, when the resolution contains several paragraphs, see Rules of  Order, Sec. 44.]    === Page 102 ===========================================================    some one else says, \"I second the motion.\"  The chairman sometimes  directs the secretary to read the resolutions again, after which he  says, \"The question is on the adoption of the resolutions just read,\"  and if no one rises immediately, he adds, \"Are you ready for the  question?\"  If no one then rises, he says, \"As many as are in favor of  the adoption of the resolutions just read, will say aye;\" after the ayes  have voted, he says, \"As many as are of a contrary opinion will say no;\"  he then announces the result of the vote as follows:  \"The motion is  carried--the resolutions are adopted,\" or, \"The ayes have it--the  resolutions are adopted.\"    (c) Committee to draft Resolutions.  If it is preferred to appoint a  committee to draft resolutions, a member, after he has addressed the  Chair and been recognized, says, \"I move that a committee be appointed  to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of this meeting on,\"    === Page 103 ===========================================================    etc., adding the subject for which the meeting was called.  This motion  being seconded, the Chairman states the question [Sec. 67] and asks, \"Are  you ready for the question?\"  If no one rises, he puts the question,  announces the result, and, if it is carried, he asks, \"Of how many shall  the committee consist?\"  If only one number is suggested, he announces  that the committee will consist of that number; if several numbers are  suggested, he states the different ones and then takes a vote on each,  beginning with the largest, until one number is selected.    He then inquires, \"How shall the committee be appointed?\"  This is  usually decided without the formality of a vote.  The committee may be  \"appointed\" by the Chair--in which case the chairman names the  committee and no vote is taken; or the committee may be \"nominated\" by  the Chair, or the members of the assembly (no member naming more than  one, except by unanimous consent), and then the assembly vote on their  appointment.  When the chairman nominates, after stating the names he  puts one question on the entire committee, thus:  \"As many as are in  favor of these gentlemen constituting the committee, will say    === Page 104 ===========================================================    aye.\"  If nominations are made by members of the assembly, and more  names mentioned than the number of the committee, a separate vote should  be taken on each name.  (In a mass meeting it is safer to have all  committees appointed by the chairman.)    When the committee are appointed they should at once retire and agree  upon a report, which should be written out as described in Sec. 53.  During  their absence other business may be attended to, or the time may be  occupied with hearing addresses.  Upon their return the chairman of the  committee (who is the one first named on the committee, and who quite  commonly, though not necessarily, is the one who made the motion to  appoint the committee), avails himself of the first opportunity to  obtain the floor,* [See Rules of Order, Sec. 2.] when he says, \"The  committee appointed to draft resolutions, are prepared to report.\"  The  chairman tells him that the assembly will now hear the report, which is  then read by the chairman of the committee, and handed to the presiding  officer, upon which the committee is dissolved without any action of the  assembly.    A member then moves the \"adoption\" or    === Page 105 ===========================================================    \"acceptance\" of the report, or that \"the resolutions be agreed to,\"  which motions have the same effect if carried, namely, to make the  resolutions the resolutions of the assembly just as if the committee had  had nothing to do with them.* [A very common error is, after a report  has been read, to move that it be received; whereas, the fact that it has  been read, shows that it has been already received by the assembly.  Another mistake, less common but dangerous, is to vote that the report  be accepted which is equivalent to adopting it), when the intention is  only to have the report up for consideration and afterwards move its  adoption.]    When one of these motions is made, the chairman acts as stated above  when the resolutions were offered by a member.  If it is not desired to  immediately adopt the resolutions, they can be debated, modified, their  consideration postponed, etc., as explained in Sec.Sec. 55-63.    When through with the business for which the assembly were convened, or  when from any other cause it is desirable to close the meeting, some one  moves \"to adjourn;\" if the motion is carried and no other time for  meeting has been appointed, the chairman says, \"The motion is carried;  --this assembly stands adjourned without day.\"  [Another method by which  the meeting may be conducted is shown in Sec. 48.]    (d) Additional Officers.  If more officers are    === Page 106 ===========================================================    required than a chairman and secretary, they can be appointed before  introducing the resolutions, in the manner described for those officers;  or the assembly can first form a temporary organization in the manner  already described, only adding \"pro tem.\" to the title of the officers,  thus:  \"chairman pro tem.\"  In this latter case, as soon as the  secretary pro tem. is elected, a committee is appointed to nominate the  permanent officers, as in the case of a convention [Sec. 47].  Frequently  the presiding officer is called the President, and sometimes there is a  large number of Vice Presidents appointed for mere complimentary  purposes.  The Vice Presidents in large formal meetings, sit on the  platform beside the President, and in his absence, or when he vacates  the chair, the first on the list that is present should take the chair.    47. Meeting of a Convention or Assembly of Delegates.  If the members  of the assembly have been elected or appointed as members, it becomes  necessary to know who are properly members of the assembly and entitled  to vote, before the permanent organization is effected.  In this case a  temporary organization is made, as already described, by the election of  a chairman    === Page 107 ===========================================================    and secretary \"pro tem.,\" when the chairman announces, \"The next  business in order is the appointment of a committee on credentials.\"  A  motion may then be made covering the entire case, thus:  \"I move that a  committee of three on the credentials of members be appointed by the  Chair, and that the committee report as soon as practicable;\" or they  may include only one of these details, thus:  \"I move that a committee  be appointed on the credentials of members.\"  In either case the Chair  proceeds as already described in the cases of committees on resolutions  [Sec. 46, (c)].    On the motion to accept the report of the committee, none can vote  except those reported by the committee as having proper credentials.  The committee, beside reporting a list of members with proper  credentials, may report doubtful or contested cases, with  recommendations, which the assembly may adopt, or reject, or postpone,  etc.  Only members whose right to their seats is undisputed, can vote.    The chairman, after the question of credentials is disposed of, at least  for the time, announces that \"The next business in order is the election  of permanent officers of the assembly.\"  Some one then moves the  appointment of a    === Page 108 ===========================================================    committee to nominate the officers, in a form similar to this:  \"I move  that a committee of three be appointed by the Chair to nominate the  permanent officers of this convention.\"  This motion is treated as  already explained."]]]
