The sun went down, they look'd from side to side,  Nor aught except the gathering sea descried;  Dark and more dark, more wet, more cold it grew,  And the most lively bade to hope adieu:  Children by love then lifted from the seas,  Felt not the waters at the parent's knees,  But wept aloud; the wind increased the sound,  And the cold billows as they broke around.     \"Once more, yet once again, with all our strength,  Cry to the land--we may be heard at length.\"  Vain hope if yet unseen! but hark! an oar,  That sound of bliss! comes dashing to their shore;  Still, still the water rises; \"Haste!\" they cry,  \"Oh! hurry, seamen; in delay we die;\"  (Seamen were these, who in their ship perceived  The drifted boat, and thus her crew relieved.)  And now the keel just cuts the cover'd sand,  Now to the gunwale stretches every hand:  With trembling pleasure all confused embark,  And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark;  While the most giddy, as they reach the shore,  Think of their danger, and their GOD adore.

Desire of Country Gentlemen for Town Associations--Book Clubs--Too  much of literary Character expected from them--Literary Conversation  prevented; by Feasting, by Cards--Good, notwithstanding, results--  Card Club with Eagerness resorted to--Players--Umpires at the Whist  Table--Petulances of Temper there discovered--Free and Easy Club;  not perfectly easy or free--Freedom, how interrupted--The superior  Member--Termination of the Evening--Drinking and Smoking Clubs--The  Midnight Conversation of the delaying Members--Society of the poorer  Inhabitants; its Use; gives Pride and Consequence to the humble  Character--Pleasant Habitations of the frugal Poor--Sailor returning  to his Family--Freemasons' Club--The Mystery--What its Origin--Its  professed Advantages--Griggs and Gregorians--A kind of Masons--  Reflections on these various Societies.    YOU say you envy in your calm retreat  Our social Meetings;--'tis with joy we meet.  In these our parties you are pleased to find  Good sense and wit, with intercourse of mind;  Composed of men who read, reflect, and write,  Who, when they meet, must yield and share delight.  To you our Book-club has peculiar charm,  For which you sicken in your quiet farm;  Here you suppose us at our leisure placed,  Enjoying freedom, and displaying taste:  With wisdom cheerful, temperately gay,  Pleased to enjoy, and willing to display.     If thus your envy gives your ease its gloom,  Give wings to fancy, and among us come.  We're now assembled; you may soon attend -  I'll introduce you--\"Gentlemen, my friend.\"     \"Now are you happy? you have pass'd a night  In gay discourse, and rational delight.\"     \"Alas! not so:  for how can mortals think,  Or thoughts exchange, if thus they eat and drink?  No! I confess when we had fairly dined,  That was no time for intercourse of mind;  There was each dish prepared with skill t'invite,  And to detain the struggling appetite;  On such occasions minds with one consent  Are to the comforts of the body lent;  There was no pause--the wine went quickly round,  Till struggling Fancy was by Bacchus bound;  Wine is to wit as water thrown on fire,  By duly sprinkling both are raised the higher;  Thus largely dealt, the vivid blaze they choke,  And all the genial flame goes off in smoke.\"     \"But when no more your boards these loads contain,  When wine no more o'erwhelms the labouring brain,  But serves, a gentle stimulus; we know  How wit must sparkle, and how fancy flow.\"  It might be so, but no such club-days come;  We always find these dampers in the room:  If to converse were all that brought us here,  A few odd members would in turn appear;  Who, dwelling nigh, would saunter in and out,  O'erlook the list, and toss the books about;  Or yawning read them, walking up and down,  Just as the loungers in the shops in town;  Till fancying nothing would their minds amuse,  They'd push them by, and go in search of news.     But our attractions are a stronger sort,  The earliest dainties and the oldest port;  All enter then with glee in every look,  And not a member thinks about a book.     Still, let me own, there are some vacant hours,  When minds might work, and men exert their powers:  Ere wine to folly spurs the giddy guest,  But gives to wit its vigour and its zest;  Then might we reason, might in turn display  Our several talents, and be wisely gay;  We might--but who a tame discourse regards,  When Whist is named, and we behold the Cards?     We from that time are neither grave nor gay;  Our thought, our care, our business is to play:  Fix'd on these spots and figures, each attends  Much to his partners, nothing to his friends.     Our public cares, the long, the warm debate,  That kept our patriots from their beds so late;  War, peace, invasion, all we hope or dread,  Vanish like dreams when men forsake their bed;  And groaning nations and contending kings  Are all forgotten for these painted things;  Paper and paste, vile figures and poor spots,  Level all minds, philosophers and sots;  And give an equal spirit, pause, and force,  Join'd with peculiar diction, to discourse:  \"Who deals?--you led--we're three by cards--had you  Honour in hand?\"--\"Upon my honour, two.\"  Hour after hour, men thus contending sit,  Grave without sense, and pointed without wit.     Thus it appears these envied Clubs possess  No certain means of social happiness;  Yet there's a good that flows from scenes like these -  Man meets with man at leisure and at ease;  We to our neighbours and our equals come,  And rub off pride that man. contracts at home;  For there, admitted master, he is prone  To claim attention and to talk alone:  But here he meets with neither son nor spouse;  No humble cousin to his bidding bows;  To his raised voice his neighbours' voices rise,  To his high look as lofty look replies;  When much he speaks, he finds that ears are closed,  And certain signs inform him when he's prosed;  Here all the value of a listener know,  And claim, in turn, the favour they bestow.     No pleasure gives the speech, when all would speak,  And all in vain a civil hearer seek.  To chance alone we owe the free discourse,  In vain you purpose what you cannot force;  'Tis when the favourite themes unbidden spring,  That fancy soars with such unwearied wing;  Then may you call in aid the moderate glass,  But let it slowly and unprompted pass;  So shall there all things for the end unite,  And give that hour of rational delight.     Men to their Clubs repair, themselves to please,  To care for nothing, and to take their ease;  In fact, for play, for wine, for news they come:  Discourse is shared with friends or found at home.     But Cards with Books are incidental things;  We've nights devoted to these queens and kings:  Then if we choose the social game, we may;  Now 'tis a duty, and we're bound to play;  Nor ever meeting of the social kind  Was more engaging, yet had less of mind.     Our eager parties, when the lunar light  Throws its full radiance on the festive night,  Of either sex, with punctual hurry come,  And fill, with one accord, an ample room;  Pleased, the fresh packs on cloth of green they see,  And seizing, handle with preluding glee;  They draw, they sit, they shuffle, cut, and deal;  Like friends assembled, but like foes to feel:  But yet not all,--a happier few have joys  Of mere amusement, and their cards are toys;  No skill nor art, nor fretful hopes have they,  But while their friends are gaming, laugh and play.     Others there are, the veterans of the game,  Who owe their pleasure to their envied fame;  Through many a year with hard-contested strife,  Have they attain'd this glory of their life:  Such is that ancient burgess, whom in vain  Would gout and fever on his couch detain;  And that large lady, who resolves to come,  Though a first fit has warn'd her of her doom!  These are as oracles:  in every cause  They settle doubts, and their decrees are laws;  But all are troubled, when, with dubious look,  Diana questions what Apollo spoke.     Here avarice first, the keen desire of gain,  Rules in each heart, and works in every brain:  Alike the veteran-dames and virgins feel,  Nor care what graybeards or what striplings deal;  Sex, age, and station, vanish from their view,  And gold, their sov'reign good, the mingled crowd pursue.     Hence they are jealous, and as rivals, keep  A watchful eye on the beloved heap;  Meantime discretion bids the tongue be still,  And mild good-humour strives with strong ill-will  Till prudence fails; when, all impatient grown,  They make their grief by their suspicions known,     \"Sir, I protest, were Job himself at play,  He'd rave to see you throw your cards away;  Not that I care a button--not a pin  For what I lose; but we had cards to win:  A saint in heaven would grieve to see such hand  Cut up by one who will not understand.\"     \"Complain of me! and so you might indeed  If I had ventured on that foolish lead,  That fatal heart--but I forgot your play -  Some folk have ever thrown their hearts away.\"     \"Yes, and their diamonds; I have heard of one  Who made a beggar of an only son.\"     \"Better a beggar, than to see him tied  To art and spite, to insolence and pride.\"     \"Sir, were I you, I'd strive to be polite,  Against my nature, for a single night.\"     \"So did you strive, and, madam! with success;  I knew no being we could censure less!\"     Is this too much?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#15)"],[1,"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SECOND.    \"And when it comes to silver, I'm a connoisseur; I have goblets as big as  wine-jars, a hundred of 'em more or less, with engraving that shows how  Cassandra killed her sons, and the dead boys are lying so naturally that  you'd think 'em alive.  I own a thousand bowls which Mummius left to my  patron, where Daedalus is shown shutting Niobe up in the Trojan horse,  and I also have cups engraved with the gladiatorial contests of Hermeros  and Petraites: they're all heavy, too.  I wouldn't sell my taste in these  matters for any money!\"  A slave dropped a cup while he was running on in  this fashion.  Glaring at him, Trimalchio said, \"Go hang yourself, since  you're so careless.\"  The boy's lip quivered and he immediately commenced  to beg for mercy.  \"Why do you pray to me?\"  Trimalchio demanded, at  this: \"I don't intend to be harsh with you, I'm only warning you against  being so awkward.\"  Finally, however, we got him to give the boy a pardon  and no sooner had this been done than the slave started running around  the room crying, \"Out with the water and in with the wine!\"  We all paid  tribute to this joke, but Agamemnon in particular, for he well knew what  strings to pull in order to secure another invitation to dinner.  Tickled  by our flattery, and mellowed by the wine, Trimalchio was just about  drunk.  \"Why hasn't one of you asked my Fortunata to dance?\"  he  demanded, \"There's no one can do a better cancan, believe me,\" and he  himself raised his arms above his head and favored us with an  impersonation of Syrus the actor; the whole household chanting:                                    Oh bravo                               Oh bravissimo    in chorus, and he would have danced out into the middle of the room  before us all, had not Fortunata whispered in his ear, telling him,  I suppose, that such low buffoonery was not in keeping with his dignity.  But nothing could be so changeable as his humor, for one minute he stood  in awe of Fortunata, but his natural propensities would break out the  next.          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-THIRD.    But his passion for dancing was interrupted at this stage by a  stenographer who read aloud, as if he were reading the public records,  \"On the seventh of the Kalends of July, on Trimalchio's estates near  Cumae, were born thirty boys and forty girls: five hundred pecks of wheat  were taken from the threshing floors and stored in the granaries: five  hundred oxen were put to yoke: the slave Mithridates was crucified on the  same date for cursing the genius of our master, Gaius: on said date ten  million sesterces were returned to the vaults as no sound investment  could be found: on said date, a fire broke out in the gardens at Pompeii,  said fire originating in the house of Nasta, the bailiff.\"  \"What's  that?\" demanded Trimalchio.  \"When were the gardens at Pompeii bought for  me?\"  \"Why, last year,\" answered the stenographer, \"for that reason the  item has not appeared in the accounts.\"  Trimalchio flew into a rage at  this.  \"If I'm not told within six months of any real estate that's  bought for me,\" he shouted, \"I forbid it's being carried to my account at  all!\"  Next, the edicts of his aediles were read aloud, and the wills of  some of his foresters in which Trimalchio was disinherited by a codicil,  then the names of his bailiffs, and that of a freedwoman who had been  repudiated by a night watchman, after she had been caught in bed with a  bath attendant, that of a porter banished to Baioe, a steward who was  standing trial, and lastly the report of a decision rendered in the  matter of a lawsuit, between some valets.  When this was over with, some  rope dancers came in and a very boresome fool stood holding a ladder,  ordering his boy to dance from rung to rung, and finally at the top, all  this to the music of popular airs; then the boy was compelled to jump  through blazing hoops while grasping a huge wine jar with his teeth.  Trimalchio was the only one who was much impressed by these tricks,  remarking that it was a thankless calling and adding that in all the  world there were just two things which could give him acute pleasure,  rope-dancers and horn blowers; all other entertainments were nothing  but nonsense.  \"I bought a company of comedians,\" he went on, \"but I  preferred for them to put on Atellane farces, and I ordered my  flute-player to play Latin airs only.\"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FOURTH.    While our noble Gaius was still talking away, the boy slipped and fell,  alighting upon Trimalchio's arm.  The whole household cried out, as did  also the guests, not that they bore such a coarse fellow any good will,  as they would gladly have seen his neck broken, but because such an  unlucky ending to the dinner might make it necessary for them to go into  mourning over a total stranger.  As for Trimalchio, he groaned heavily  and bent over his arm as though it had been injured: doctors flocked  around him, and Fortunata was among the very first, her hair was  streaming and she held a cup in her hand and screamed out her grief and  unhappiness.  As for the boy who had fallen, he was crawling at our feet,  imploring pardon.  I was uneasy for fear his prayers would lead up to  some ridiculous theatrical climax, for I had not yet been able to forget  that cook who had forgotten to bowel that hog, and so, for this reason, I  began to scan the whole dining-room very closely, to see if an automaton  would come out through the wall; and all the more so as a slave was  beaten for having bound up his master's bruised arm in white wool instead  of purple.  Nor was my suspicion unjustified, for in place of punishment,  Trimalchio ordered that the boy be freed, so that no one could say that  so exalted a personage had been injured by a slave.          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIFTH.    We applauded his action and engaged in a discussion upon the instability  of human affairs, which many took sides. \"A good reason,\" declared  Trimalchio, \"why such an occasion shouldn't slip by without an epigram.\"  He called for his tablets at once, and after racking his brains for a  little while, he got off the following:                        The unexpected will turn up;                      Our whole lives Fortune bungles up.                      Falernian, boy, hand round the cup.    This epigram led up to a discussion of the poets, and for a long time,  the greatest praise was bestowed upon Mopsus the Thracian, until  Trimalchio broke in with: \"Professor, I wish you'd tell me how you'd  compare Cicero and Publilius.  I'm of the opinion that the first was the  more eloquent, but that the last moralizes more beautifully, for what can  excel these lines?         Insatiable luxury crumbles the walls of war;       To satiate gluttony, peacocks in coops are brought       Arrayed in gold plumage like Babylon tapestry rich.       Numidian guinea-fowls, capons, all perish for thee:       And even the wandering stork, welcome guest that he is,       The emblem of sacred maternity, slender of leg       And gloctoring exile from winter, herald of spring,       Still, finds his last nest in the--cauldron of gluttony base.       India surrenders her pearls; and what mean they to thee?       That thy wife decked with sea-spoils adorning her breast            and her head       On the couch of a stranger lies lifting adulterous legs?       The emerald green, the glass bauble, what mean they to thee?       Or the fire of the ruby?  Except that pure chastity shine       From the depth of the jewels: in garments of woven wind clad       Our brides might as well take their stand, their game            naked to stalk,       As seek it in gossamer tissue transparent as air.\"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SIXTH.    \"What should we say was the hardest calling, after literature?\" he asked.  \"That of the doctor or that of the money-changer, I would say: the  doctor, because he has to know what poor devils have got in their  insides, and when the fever's due: but I hate them like the devil, for my  part, because they're always ordering me on a diet of duck soup: and the  money-changer's, because he's got to be able to see the silver through  the copper plating.  When we come to the dumb beasts, the oxen and sheep  are the hardest worked, the oxen, thanks to whose labor we have bread to  chew on, the sheep, because their wool tricks us out so fine.  It's the  greatest outrage under the sun for people to eat mutton and then wear a  tunic.  Then there's the bee: in my opinion, they're divine insects  because they puke honey, though there are folks that claim that they  bring it from Jupiter, and that's the reason they sting, too, for  wherever you find a sweet, you'll find a bitter too.\" He was just putting  the philosophers out of business when lottery tickets were passed around  in a cup.  A slave boy assigned to that duty read aloud the names of the  souvenirs: \"Silver s--ham,\" a ham was brought in with some silver vinegar  cruets on top of it; \"cervical\"--something soft for the neck--a piece of  the cervix--neck--of a sheep was brought in; \"serisapia\"--after wit--\"and  contumelia\"--insult--we were given must wafers and an apple-melon--and a  phallus--contus--; \"porri\"--leeks--\"and persica,\" he picked up a whip and  a knife; \"passeres\"--sparrows\" and a fly--trap,\" the answer was  raisins--uva passa--and Attic honey; \"cenatoria\"--a dinner toga--\"and  forensia\"--business dress--he handed out a piece of meat--suggestive of  dinner--and a note-book--suggestive of business--; \"canale\"--chased by a  dog--\"and pedale\"--pertaining to the foot--, a hare and a slipper were  brought out; \"lamphrey\"--murena--\"and a letter,\" he held up a  mouse--mus--and a frog--rana--tied together, and a bundle of  beet--beta--the Greek letter beta--.  We laughed long and loud, there  were a thousand of these jokes, more or less, which have now escaped my  memory.          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SEVENTH. "]]]
