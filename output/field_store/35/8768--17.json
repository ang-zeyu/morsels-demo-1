But the Tin Woodman, having no fear of fire, averted the stampede by a few  sensible words.    \"Look at the Field Mouse!\" he shouted. \"The fire does not burn her in the  least. In fact, it is no fire at all, but only a deception.\"        167    Indeed, to watch the little Queen march calmly through the advancing flames  restored courage to every member of the party, and they followed her without  being even scorched.    \"This is surely a most extraordinary adventure,\" said the Woggle-Bug, who  was greatly amazed; \"for it upsets all the Natural Laws that I heard  Professor Nowitall teach in the school-house.\"    \"Of course it does,\" said the Scarecrow, wisely. \"All magic is unnatural,  and for that reason is to be feared and avoided. But I see before us the  gates of the Emerald City, so I imagine we have now overcome all the magical  obstacles that seemed to oppose us.\"    Indeed, the walls of the City were plainly visible, and the Queen of the  Field Mice, who had guided them so faithfully, came near to bid them good-  bye.    \"We are very grateful to your Majesty for your kind assistance,\" said the  Tin Woodman, bowing before the pretty creature.    \"I am always pleased to be of service to my friends,\" answered the Queen,  and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home.        168               Full page line-art drawing.        169               The Prisoners of the Queen      Approaching the gateway of the Emerald City the travelers found it guarded  by two girls of the Army of Revolt, who opposed their entrance by drawing  the knitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that  came near.    But the Tin Woodman was not afraid.\"    At the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate,\" he said. \"But  there will be no 'worst,' for I think I can manage to frighten these absurd  soldiers very easily. Follow me closely, all of you!\"    Then, swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him, he  advanced upon the gate, and the others followed him without hesitation.    The girls, who had expected no resistance whatever, were terrified by the  sweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city; so that our        170  travelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble  pavement of the wide street toward the royal palace.    \"At this rate we will soon have your Majesty upon the throne again,\" said  the Tin Woodman, laughing at his easy conquest of the guards.    \"Thank you, friend Nick,\" returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. \"Nothing can  resist your kind heart and your sharp axe.\"    As they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men  were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in  groups, gossiping and laughing.    \"What has happened?\" the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy  beard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the  sidewalk.    \"Why, we've had a revolution, your Majesty as you ought to know very well,\"  replied the man; \"and since you went away the women have been running things  to suit themselves. I'm glad you have decided to come back and restore  order, for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the  strength of every man in the Emerald City.\"    \"Hm!\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. \"If it        171  is such hard work as you say, how did the women manage it so easily?\"    \"I really do not know\" replied the man, with a deep sigh. \"Perhaps the women  are made of castiron.\"    No movement was made, as they passed along the street, to oppose their  progress. Several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast  curious looks upon our friends, but immediately they would turn away with a  laugh or a sneer and resume their chatter. And when they met with several  girls belonging to the Army of Revolt, those soldiers, instead of being  alarmed or appearing surprised, merely stepped out of the way and allowed  them to advance without protest.    This action rendered the Scarecrow uneasy.\"    I'm afraid we are walking into a trap,\" said he.    \"Nonsense!\" returned Nick Chopper, confidently; \"the silly creatures are  conquered already!\"    But the Scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt, and Tip  said:    \"It's too easy, altogether. Look out for trouble ahead.\"    \"I will,\" returned his Majesty. Unopposed they reached the royal palace and  marched up the marble steps, which had once been        172               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"IT'S TOO EASY, ALTOGETHER.\"        173  thickly crusted with emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the  jewels had been ruthlessly torn from their settings by the Army of Revolt.  And so far not a rebel barred their way.    Through the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the  Tin Woodman and his followers, and here, when the green silken curtains fell  behind them, they saw a curious sight.    Seated within the glittering throne was General Jinjur, with the Scarecrow's  second-best crown upon her head, and the royal sceptre in her right hand. A  box of caramels, from which she was eating, rested in her lap, and the girl  seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings.    The Scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her, while the Tin Woodman  leaned upon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his  Majesty's person.    \"How dare you sit in my throne?\" demanded the Scarecrow, sternly eyeing the  intruder. \"Don't you know you are guilty of treason, and that there is a law  against treason?\"    \"The throne belongs to whoever is able to take it,\" answered Jinjur, as she  slowly ate another caramel. \"I have taken it, as you see; so just now I am  the Queen, and all who oppose me are guilty of        174  treason, and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned.\"    This view of the case puzzled the Scarecrow.    \"How is it, friend Nick?\" he asked, turning to the Tin Woodman.    \"Why, when it comes to Law, I have nothing to, say\" answered that personage.  \"for laws were never meant to be understood, and it is foolish to make the  attempt.\"    \"Then what shall we do?\" asked the Scarecrow, in dismay.    \"Why don't you marry the Queen? And then you can both rule,\" suggested the  Woggle-Bug.    Jinjur glared at the insect fiercely. \"Why don't you send her back to her  mother, where she belongs?\" asked Jack Pumpkinhead.    Jinjur frowned.    \"Why don't you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself, and  promises to be good?\" enquired Tip. Jinjur's lip curled scornfully.    \"Or give her a good shaking!\" added the Saw-Horse.    \"No,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"we must treat the poor girl with gentleness.  Let us give her all the Jewels she can carry, and send her away happy and  contented.\"        175    At this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud, and the next minute clapped her pretty  hands together thrice, as if for a signal.    \"You are very absurd creatures,\" said she; \"but I am tired of your nonsense  and have no time to bother with you longer.\"    While the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent  speech, a startling thing happened. The Tin Woodman's axe was snatched from  his grasp by some person behind him, and he found himself disarmed and  helpless. At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the  devoted band, and turning to see whence this came they found themselves  surrounded by the Army of Revolt, the girls bearing in either hand their  glistening knitting-needles. The entire throne room seemed to be filled with  the rebels, and the Scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were  prisoners.    \"You see how foolish it is to oppose a woman's wit,\" said Jinjur, gaily;  \"and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the Emerald City than  a Scarecrow. I bear you no ill will, I assure you; but lest you should prove  troublesome to me in the future I shall order you all to be destroyed. That  is, all except the boy, who belongs to old Mombi and must be restored to her  keeping. The rest of        176  you are not human, and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you. The  Saw-Horse and the Pumpkinhead's body I will have chopped up for kindling-  wood; and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts. The Scarecrow will do nicely  to start a bonfire, and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to  the goats. As for this immense Woggle-Bug--\"    \"Highly Magnified, if you please!\" interrupted the insect.    \"I think I will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you,\" continued  the Queen, reflectively.    The Woggle-Bug shuddered.    \"Or, if that won't do, we might use you for a Hungarian goulash, stewed and  highly spiced,\" she added, cruelly.    This programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked  upon one another in a panic of fear. The Scarecrow alone did not give way to  despair. He stood quietly before the Queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep  thought as he strove to find some means to escape.    While thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently. At once  his expression changed from sadness to joy, and raising his hand he quickly  unbuttoned the front of his jacket.    This action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd        177  of girls clustering about him, but none of them suspected what he was doing  until a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#15)"],[1,"rogue of the gang, or the completest    cheat.
