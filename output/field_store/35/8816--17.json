Who shall describe the theatrical attitudes assumed by the old ladies  as they reappeared at the front-door,--being luckily out of direct  range,--and set the handkerchiefs in wilder motion than ever? They  brandished them, they twirled them after the manner of the domestic  mop, they clasped their hands, handkerchiefs included. Meanwhile their  friends in the wood popped away steadily at us, with small effect; and  occasionally an invisible field-piece thundered feebly from another  quarter, with equally invisible results. Reaching the wharf, one  company, under Lieutenant (now Captain) Danil-son, was promptly deployed  in search of our assailants, who soon grew silent. Not so the old  ladies, when I announced to them my purpose, and added, with extreme  regret, that, as the wind was high, I should burn only that half of  the town which lay to leeward of their house, which did not, after  all, amount to much. Between gratitude for this degree of mercy, and  imploring appeals for greater, the treacherous old ladies manoeuvred  with clasped hands and demonstrative handkerchiefs around me, impairing  the effect of their eloquence by constantly addressing me as \"Mr.  Captain\"; for I have observed, that, while the sternest officer is  greatly propitiated by attributing to him a rank a little higher than  his own, yet no one is ever mollified by an error in the opposite  direction. I tried, however, to disregard such low considerations,  and to strike the correct mean between the sublime patriot and the  unsanctified incendiary, while I could find no refuge from weak  contrition save in greater and greater depths of courtesy; and so  melodramatic became our interview that some of the soldiers still  maintain that \"dem dar ole Secesh women been a-gwine for kiss de  Cunnel,\" before we ended. But of this monstrous accusation I wish to  register an explicit denial, once for all.    Dropping down to Fernandina unmolested after this affair, we were kindly  received by the military and naval commanders,--Colonel Hawley, of  the Seventh Connecticut (now Brigadier-General Hawley), and  Lieutenant-Commander Hughes, of the gunboat Mohawk. It turned out very  opportunely that both of these officers had special errands to suggest  still farther up the St. Mary's, and precisely in the region where I  wished to go. Colonel Hawley showed me a letter from the War Department,  requesting him to ascertain the possibility of obtaining a supply  of brick for Fort Clinch from the brickyard which had furnished the  original materials, but which had not been visited since the perilous  river-trip of the Ottawa. Lieutenant Hughes wished to obtain information  for the Admiral respecting a Rebel steamer,--the Berosa,--said to  be lying somewhere up the river, and awaiting her chance to run the  blockade. I jumped at the opportunity. Berosa and brickyard,--both were  near Wood-stock, the former home of Corporal Sutton; he was ready  and eager to pilot us up the river; the moon would be just right that  evening, setting at 3h. 19m. A.M.; and our boat was precisely the one  to undertake the expedition. Its double-headed shape was just what was  needed in that swift and crooked stream; the exposed pilot-houses had  been tolerably barricaded with the thick planks from St. Simon's; and  we further obtained some sand-bags from Fort Clinch, through the aid of  Captain Sears, the officer in charge, who had originally suggested the  expedition after brick. In return for this aid, the Planter was sent  back to the wharf at St. Mary's, to bring away a considerable supply  of the same precious article, which we had observed near the wharf.  Meanwhile the John Adams was coaling from naval supplies, through the  kindness of Lieutenant Hughes; and the Ben De Ford was taking in  the lumber which we had yesterday brought down. It was a great  disappointment to be unable to take the latter vessel up the river; but  I was unwillingly convinced that, though the depth of water might be  sufficient, yet her length would be unmanageable in the swift current  and sharp turns. The Planter must also be sent on a separate cruise,  as her weak and disabled machinery made her useless for my purpose. Two  hundred men were therefore transferred, as before, to the narrow hold  of the John Adams, in addition to the company permanently stationed on  board to work the guns. At seven o'clock on the evening of January 29th,  beneath a lovely moon, we steamed up the river.    Never shall I forget the mystery and excitement of that night. I know  nothing in life more fascinating than the nocturnal ascent of an unknown  river, leading far into an enemy's country, where one glides in the  dim moonlight between dark hills and meadows, each turn of the channel  making it seem like an inland lake, and cutting you off as by a  barrier from all behind,--with no sign of human life, but an occasional  picket-fire left glimmering beneath the bank, or the yelp of a dog from  some low-lying plantation. On such occasions every nerve is strained to  its utmost tension; all dreams of romance appear to promise immediate  fulfilment; all lights on board the vessel are obscured, loud voices  are hushed; you fancy a thousand men on shore, and yet see nothing; the  lonely river, unaccustomed to furrowing keels, lapses by the vessel with  a treacherous sound; and all the senses are merged in a sort of anxious  trance. Three tunes I have had in full perfection this fascinating  experience; but that night was the first, and its zest was the keenest.  It will come back to me in dreams, if I live a thousand years.    I feared no attack during our ascent,--that danger was for our return;  but I feared the intricate navigation of the river, though I did not  fully know, till the actual experience, how dangerous it was. We passed  without trouble far above the scene of our first fight,--the Battle  of the Hundred Pines, as my officers had baptized it; and ever, as we  ascended, the banks grew steeper, the current swifter, the channel more  tortuous and more encumbered with projecting branches and drifting wood.  No piloting less skilful than that of Corporal Sutton and his mate,  James Bezzard, could have carried us through, I thought; and no  side-wheel steamer less strong than a ferry-boat could have borne the  crash and force with which we struck the wooded banks of the river. But  the powerful paddles, built to break the Northern ice, could crush the  Southern pine as well; and we came safely out of entanglements that at  first seemed formidable. We had the tide with us, which makes steering  far more difficult; and, in the sharp angles of the river, there was  often no resource but to run the bow boldly on shore, let the stern  swing round, and then reverse the motion. As the reversing machinery  was generally out of order, the engineer stupid or frightened, and  the captain excited, this involved moments of tolerably concentrated  anxiety. Eight times we grounded in the upper waters, and once lay  aground for half an hour; but at last we dropped anchor before the  little town of Woodstock, after moonset and an hour before daybreak,  just as I had planned, and so quietly that scarcely a dog barked, and  not a soul in the town, as we afterwards found, knew of our arrival.    As silently as possible, the great flat-boat which we had brought from  St. Simon's was filled with men. Major Strong was sent on shore with  two companies,--those of Captain James and Captain Metcalf,--with  instructions to surround the town quietly, allow no one to leave it,  molest no one, and hold as temporary prisoners every man whom he found.  I watched them push off into the darkness, got the remaining force ready  to land, and then paced the deck for an hour in silent watchfulness,  waiting for rifle-shots. Not a sound came from the shore, save  the barking of dogs and the morning crow of cocks; the time seemed  interminable; but when daylight came, I landed, and found a pair of  scarlet trousers pacing on their beat before every house in the village,  and a small squad of prisoners, stunted and forlorn as Falstaff's ragged  regiment, already hi hand. I observed with delight the good demeanor  of my men towards these forlorn Anglo-Saxons, and towards the more  tumultuous women. Even one soldier, who threatened to throw an old  termagant into the river, took care to append the courteous epithet  \"Madam.\"    I took a survey of the premises. The chief house, a pretty one with  picturesque outbuildings, was that of Mrs. A., who owned the mills  and lumber-wharves adjoining. The wealth of these wharves had not been  exaggerated. There was lumber enough to freight half a dozen steamers,  and I half regretted that I had agreed to take down a freight of  bricks instead. Further researches made me grateful that I had already  explained to my men the difference between public foraging and private  plunder. Along the river-bank I found building after building crowded  with costly furniture, all neatly packed, just as it was sent up from  St. Mary's when that town was abandoned. Pianos were a drug; china,  glass-ware, mahogany, pictures, all were here. And here were my men, who  knew that their own labor had earned for their masters these luxuries,  or such as these; their own wives and children were still sleeping on  the floor, perhaps, at Beaufort or Fernandina; and yet they submitted,  almost without a murmur, to the enforced abstinence. Bed and bedding  for our hospitals they might take from those store-rooms,--such as the  surgeon selected,--also an old flag which we found in a corner, and an  old field-piece (which the regiment still possesses),--but after this  the doors were closed and left unmolested. It cost a struggle to some  of the men, whose wives were destitute, I know; but their pride was very  easily touched, and when this abstinence was once recognized as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#15)"],[1,"  So in the dusk of evening they went down to the river-side, Chalciope and  Medeia the witch-maiden, and Argus, Phrixus' son.  And Argus the boy  crept forward, among the beds of reeds, till he came where the heroes  were sleeping, on the thwarts of the ship, beneath the bank, while Jason  kept ward on shore, and leant upon his lance full of thought.  And the  boy came to Jason, and said--    'I am the son of Phrixus, your Cousin; and Chalciope my mother waits for  you, to talk about the golden fleece.'    Then Jason went boldly with the boy, and found the two princesses  standing; and when Chalciope saw him she wept, and took his hands, and  cried--'O cousin of my beloved, go home before you die!'    'It would be base to go home now, fair princess, and to have sailed all  these seas in vain.'  Then both the princesses besought him; but Jason  said, 'It is too late.'    'But you know not,' said Medeia, 'what he must do who would win the  fleece.  He must tame the two brazen-footed bulls, who breathe devouring  flame; and with them he must plough ere nightfall four acres in the field  of Ares; and he must sow them with serpents' teeth, of which each tooth  springs up into an armed man.  Then he must fight with all those  warriors; and little will it profit him to conquer them, for the fleece  is guarded by a serpent, more huge than any mountain pine; and over his  body you must step if you would reach the golden fleece.'    Then Jason laughed bitterly.  'Unjustly is that fleece kept here, and by  an unjust and lawless king; and unjustly shall I die in my youth, for I  will attempt it ere another sun be set.'    Then Medeia trembled, and said, 'No mortal man can reach that fleece  unless I guide him through.  For round it, beyond the river, is a wall  full nine ells high, with lofty towers and buttresses, and mighty gates  of threefold brass; and over the gates the wall is arched, with golden  battlements above.  And over the gateway sits Brimo, the wild  witch-huntress of the woods, brandishing a pine-torch in her hands, while  her mad hounds howl around.  No man dare meet her or look on her, but  only I her priestess, and she watches far and wide lest any stranger  should come near.'    'No wall so high but it may be climbed at last, and no wood so thick but  it may be crawled through; no serpent so wary but he may be charmed, or  witch-queen so fierce but spells may soothe her; and I may yet win the  golden fleece, if a wise maiden help bold men.'    And he looked at Medeia cunningly, and held her with his glittering eye,  till she blushed and trembled, and said--    'Who can face the fire of the bulls' breath, and fight ten thousand armed  men?'    'He whom you help,' said Jason, flattering her, 'for your fame is spread  over all the earth.  Are you not the queen of all enchantresses, wiser  even than your sister Circe, in her fairy island in the West?'    'Would that I were with my sister Circe in her fairy island in the West,  far away from sore temptation and thoughts which tear the heart!  But if  it must be so--for why should you die?--I have an ointment here; I made  it from the magic ice-flower which sprang from Prometheus' wound, above  the clouds on Caucasus, in the dreary fields of snow.  Anoint yourself  with that, and you shall have in you seven men's strength; and anoint  your shield with it, and neither fire nor sword can harm you.  But what  you begin you must end before sunset, for its virtue lasts only one day.  And anoint your helmet with it before you sow the serpents' teeth; and  when the sons of earth spring up, cast your helmet among their ranks, and  the deadly crop of the War-god's field will mow itself, and perish.'    Then Jason fell on his knees before her, and thanked her and kissed her  hands; and she gave him the vase of ointment, and fled trembling through  the reeds.  And Jason told his comrades what had happened, and showed  them the box of ointment; and all rejoiced but Idas, and he grew mad with  envy.    And at sunrise Jason went and bathed, and anointed himself from head to  foot, and his shield, and his helmet, and his weapons, and bade his  comrades try the spell.  So they tried to bend his lance, but it stood  like an iron bar; and Idas in spite hewed at it with his sword, but the  blade flew to splinters in his face.  Then they hurled their lances at  his shield, but the spear-points turned like lead; and Caineus tried to  throw him, but he never stirred a foot; and Polydeuces struck him with  his fist a blow which would have killed an ox, but Jason only smiled, and  the heroes danced about him with delight; and he leapt, and ran, and  shouted in the joy of that enormous strength, till the sun rose, and it  was time to go and to claim Aietes' promise.    So he sent up Telamon and Aithalides to tell Aietes that he was ready for  the fight; and they went up among the marble walls, and beneath the roofs  of gold, and stood in Aietes' hall, while he grew pale with rage.    'Fulfil your promise to us, child of the blazing Sun.  Give us the  serpents' teeth, and let loose the fiery bulls; for we have found a  champion among us who can win the golden fleece.'    And Aietes bit his lips, for he fancied that they had fled away by night:  but he could not go back from his promise; so he gave them the serpents'  teeth.    Then he called for his chariot and his horses, and sent heralds through  all the town; and all the people went out with him to the dreadful  War-god's field.    And there Aietes sat upon his throne, with his warriors on each hand,  thousands and tens of thousands, clothed from head to foot in steel  chain-mail.  And the people and the women crowded to every window and  bank and wall; while the Minuai stood together, a mere handful in the  midst of that great host.    And Chalciope was there and Argus, trembling, and Medeia, wrapped closely  in her veil; but Aietes did not know that she was muttering cunning  spells between her lips.    Then Jason cried, 'Fulfil your promise, and let your fiery bulls come  forth.'    Then Aietes bade open the gates, and the magic bulls leapt out.  Their  brazen hoofs rang upon the ground, and their nostrils sent out sheets of  flame, as they rushed with lowered heads upon Jason; but he never  flinched a step.  The flame of their breath swept round him, but it  singed not a hair of his head; and the bulls stopped short and trembled  when Medeia began her spell.    Then Jason sprang upon the nearest and seized him by the horn; and up and  down they wrestled, till the bull fell grovelling on his knees; for the  heart of the brute died within him, and his mighty limbs were loosed,  beneath the steadfast eye of that dark witch-maiden and the magic whisper  of her lips.    So both the bulls were tamed and yoked; and Jason bound them to the  plough, and goaded them onward with his lance till he had ploughed the  sacred field.    And all the Minuai shouted; but Aietes bit his lips with rage, for the  half of Jason's work was over, and the sun was yet high in heaven.    Then he took the serpents' teeth and sowed them, and waited what would  befall.  But Medeia looked at him and at his helmet, lest he should  forget the lesson she had taught.    And every furrow heaved and bubbled, and out of every clod arose a man.  Out of the earth they rose by thousands, each clad from head to foot in  steel, and drew their swords and rushed on Jason, where he stood in the  midst alone.    Then the Minuai grew pale with fear for him; but Aietes laughed a bitter  laugh.  'See! if I had not warriors enough already round me, I could call  them out of the bosom of the earth.'    But Jason snatched off his helmet, and hurled it into the thickest of the  throng.  And blind madness came upon them, suspicion, hate, and fear; and  one cried to his fellow, 'Thou didst strike me!' and another, 'Thou art  Jason; thou shalt die!'  So fury seized those earth-born phantoms, and  each turned his hand against the rest; and they fought and were never  weary, till they all lay dead upon the ground.  Then the magic furrows  opened, and the kind earth took them home into her breast and the grass  grew up all green again above them, and Jason's work was done.    Then the Minuai rose and shouted, till Prometheus heard them from his  crag.  And Jason cried, 'Lead me to the fleece this moment, before the  sun goes down.'    But Aietes thought, 'He has conquered the bulls, and sown and reaped the  deadly crop.  Who is this who is proof against all magic?  He may kill  the serpent yet.'  So he delayed, and sat taking counsel with his princes  till the sun went down and all was dark.  Then he bade a herald cry,  'Every man to his home for to-night.  To-morrow we will meet these  heroes, and speak about the golden fleece.'    Then he turned and looked at Medeia.  'This is your doing, false  witch-maid!  You have helped these yellow-haired strangers, and brought  shame upon your father and yourself!'    Medeia shrank and trembled, and her face grew pale with fear; and Aietes  knew that she was guilty, and whispered, 'If they win the fleece, you  die!'    But the Minuai marched toward their ship, growling like lions cheated of  their prey; for they saw that Aietes meant to mock them, and to cheat  them out of all their toil.  And Oileus said, 'Let us go to the grove  together, and take the fleece by force.'    And Idas the rash cried, 'Let us draw lots who shall go in first; for,  while the dragon is devouring one, the rest can slay him and carry off  the fleece in peace.'  But Jason held them back, though he praised them;  for he hoped for Medeia's help.    And after awhile Medeia came trembling, and wept a long while before she  spoke.  And at last--    'My end is come, and I must die; for my father has found out that I have  helped you.  You he would kill if he dared; but he will not harm you,  because you have been his guests.  Go then, go, and remember poor Medeia  when you"]]]
