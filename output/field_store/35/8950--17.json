XXIX.--When the Aduatuci, of whom we have written above, were coming  with all their forces to the assistance of the Nervii, upon this battle  being reported to them, they returned home after they were on the march;  deserting all their towns and forts, they conveyed together all their  possessions into one town, eminently fortified by nature. While this  town had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices, there  was left on one side a gently ascending approach, of not more than 200  feet in width; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double  wall: besides, they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened  stakes upon the walls. They were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones,  who, when they were marching into our province and Italy, having  deposited on this side the river Rhine such of their baggage-trains as  they could not drive or convey with them, left 6000 of their men as a  guard and defence for them. These having, after the destruction of their  countrymen, been harassed for many years by their neighbours, while one  time they waged war offensively, and at another resisted it when waged  against them, concluded a peace with the consent of all, and chose this  place as their settlement.    XXX.--And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies  from the town, and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes:  afterwards, when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet [in height], and  fifteen miles in circuit, they kept themselves within the town. When,  vineae having been brought up and a mound raised, they observed that a  tower also was being built at a distance, they at first began to mock  the Romans from their wall, and to taunt them with the following  speeches. \"For what purpose was so vast a machine constructed at so  great a distance?\" \"With what hands,\" or \"with what strength did they,  especially [as they were] men of such very small stature\" (for our  shortness of stature, in comparison with the great size of their bodies,  is generally a subject of much contempt to the men of Gaul), \"trust to  place against their walls a tower of such great weight.\"    XXXI.--But when they saw that it was being moved, and was approaching  their walls, startled by the new and unaccustomed sight, they sent  ambassadors to Caesar [to treat] about peace; who spoke in the following  manner: \"That they did not believe the Romans waged war without divine  aid, since they were able to move forward machines of such a height with  so great speed, and thus fight from close quarters: that they resigned  themselves and all their possessions to [Caesar's] disposal: that they  begged and earnestly entreated one thing, viz., that if perchance,  agreeably to his clemency and humanity, which they had heard of from  others, he should resolve that the Aduatuci were to be spared, he would  not deprive them of their arms; that all their neighbours were enemies  to them and envied their courage, from whom they could not defend  themselves if their arms were delivered up: that it was better for them,  if they should be reduced to that state, to suffer any fate from the  Roman people, than to be tortured to death by those among whom they had  been accustomed to rule.\"    XXXII.--To these things Caesar replied, \"That he, in accordance with his  custom, rather than owing to their desert, should spare the state, if  they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch  the wall; but that there was no condition of surrender, except upon  their arms being delivered up; that he should do to them that which he  had done in the case of the Nervii, and would command their neighbours  not to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the Roman  people.\" The matter being reported to their countrymen, they said that  they would execute his commands. Having cast a very large quantity of  their arms from the wall into the trench which was before the town, so  that the heaps of arms almost equalled the top of the wall and the  rampart, and nevertheless having retained and concealed, as we  afterwards discovered, about a third part in the town, the gates were  opened, and they enjoyed peace for that day.    XXXIII.--Towards evening Caesar ordered the gates to be shut, and the  soldiers to go out of the town, lest the townspeople should receive any  injury from them by night. They [the Aduatuci], by a design before  entered into, as we afterwards understood, because they believed that,  as a surrender had been made, our men would dismiss their guards, or at  least would keep watch less carefully, partly with those arms which they  had retained and concealed, partly with shields made of bark or  interwoven wickers, which they had hastily covered over with skins (as  the shortness of time required) in the third watch, suddenly made a  sally from the town with all their forces [in that direction] in which  the ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult. The signal  having been immediately given by fires, as Caesar had previously  commanded, a rush was made thither [_i.e._ by the Roman soldiers] from  the nearest fort; and the battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously  as it ought to be fought by brave men, in the last hope of safety, in a  disadvantageous place, and against those who were throwing their weapons  from a rampart and from towers; since all hope of safety depended on  their courage alone. About 4000 of the men having been slain, the rest  were forced back into the town. The day after, Caesar, after breaking  open the gates, which there was no one then to defend, and sending in  our soldiers, sold the whole spoil of that town. The number of 53,000  persons was reported to him by those who had bought them.    XXXIV.--At the same time he was informed by P. Crassus, whom he had sent  with one legion against the Veneti, the Unelli, the Osismii, the  Curiosolitae, the Sesuvii, the Aulerci, and the Rhedones, which are  maritime states, and touch upon the [Atlantic] ocean, that all these  nations were brought under the dominion and power of the Roman people.    XXXV.--These things being achieved, [and] all Gaul being subdued, so  high an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians, that  ambassadors were sent to Caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the  Rhine, to promise that they would give hostages and execute his  commands. Which embassies Caesar, because he was hastening into Italy  and Illyricum, ordered to return to him at the beginning of the  following summer. He himself, having led his legions into winter-quarters  among the Carnutes, the Andes, and the Turones, which states  were close to those regions in which he had waged war, set out for  Italy; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those  achievements, upon receiving Caesar's letter; [an honour] which before  that time had been conferred on none.        BOOK III    I.--When Caesar was setting out for Italy, he sent Servius Galba with  the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry against the Nantuates, the  Veragri, and Seduni, who extend from the territories of the Allobroges,  and the lake of Geneva, and the river Rhone to the top of the Alps. The  reason for sending him was, that he desired that the pass along the  Alps, through which [the Roman] merchants had been accustomed to travel  with great danger, and under great imposts, should be opened. He  permitted him, if he thought it necessary, to station the legion in  these places, for the purpose of wintering. Galba having fought some  successful battles, and stormed several of their forts, upon ambassadors  being sent to him from all parts and hostages given and a peace  concluded, determined to station two cohorts among the Nantuates, and to  winter in person with the other cohorts of that legion in a village of  the Veragri, which is called Octodurus; and this village being situated  in a valley, with a small plain annexed to it, is bounded on all sides  by very high mountains. As this village was divided into two parts by a  river, he granted one part of it to the Gauls, and assigned the other,  which had been left by them unoccupied, to the cohorts to winter in. He  fortified this [latter] part with a rampart and a ditch.    II.--When several days had elapsed in winter quarters, and he had  ordered corn to be brought in, he was suddenly informed by his scouts  that all the people had gone off in the night from that part of the town  which he had given up to the Gauls, and that the mountains which hung  over it were occupied by a very large force of the Sedani and Veragri.  It had happened for several reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed the  design of renewing the war and cutting off that legion. First, because  they despised a single legion, on account of its small number, and that  not quite full (two cohorts having been detached, and several  individuals being absent, who had been despatched for the purpose of  seeking provision); then, likewise, because they thought that on account  of the disadvantageous character of the situation, even their first  attack could not be sustained [by us] when they would rush from the  mountains into the valley, and discharge their weapons upon us. To this  was added, that they were indignant that their children were torn from  them under the title of hostages, and they were persuaded that the  Romans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps, and unite those  parts to the neighbouring province [of Gaul], not only to secure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#16)"],[1,"the commodity of the power of vision, or hearing, or of  seeing. Has then God given you eyes to no purpose? and to no purpose has  he infused into them a spirit so strong and of such skilful contrivance  as to reach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are  seen? What messenger is so swift and vigilant? And to no purpose has he  made the interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the  vision penetrates through the atmosphere which is in a manner moved? And  to no purpose has he made light, without the presence of which there  would be no use in any other thing?    Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget the things  which are superior to them. But indeed for the power of seeing and  hearing, and indeed for life itself, and for the things which contribute  to support it, for the fruits which are dry, and for wine and oil give  thanks to God: but remember that he has given you something else better  than all these, I mean the power of using them, proving them, and  estimating the value of each. For what is that which gives information  about each of these powers, what each of them is worth? Is it each  faculty itself? Did you ever hear the faculty of vision saying anything  about itself? or the faculty of hearing? or wheat, or barley, or a  horse, or a dog? No; but they are appointed as ministers and slaves to  serve the faculty which has the power of making use of the appearances  of things. And if you inquire what is the value of each thing, of whom  do you inquire? who answers you? How then can any other faculty be more  powerful than this, which uses the rest as ministers and itself proves  each and pronounces about them? for which of them knows what itself is,  and what is its own value? which of them knows when it ought to employ  itself and when not? what faculty is it which opens and closes the eyes,  and turns them away from objects to which it ought not to apply them and  does apply them to other objects? Is it the faculty of vision? No, but  it is the faculty of the will. What is that faculty which closes and  opens the ears? what is that by which they are curious and inquisitive,  or on the contrary unmoved by what is said? is it the faculty of  hearing? It is no other than the faculty of the will. Will this faculty  then, seeing that it is amidst all the other faculties which are blind  and dumb and unable to see anything else except the very acts for which  they are appointed in order to minister to this (faculty) and serve it,  but this faculty alone sees sharp and sees what is the value of each of  the rest; will this faculty declare to us that anything else is the  best, or that itself is? And what else does the eye do when it is opened  than see? But whether we ought to look on the wife of a certain person,  and in what manner, who tells us? The faculty of the will. And whether  we ought to believe what is said or not to believe it, and if we do  believe, whether we ought to be moved by it or not, who tells us? Is it  not the faculty of the will?    But if you ask me what then is the most excellent of all things, what  must I say? I cannot say the power of speaking, but the power of the  will, when it is right ([Greek: orthae]). For it is this which uses the  other (the power of speaking), and all the other faculties both small  and great. For when this faculty of the will is set right, a man who is  not good becomes good: but when it fails, a man becomes bad. It is  through this that we are unfortunate, that we are fortunate, that we  blame one another, are pleased with one another. In a word, it is this  which if we neglect it makes unhappiness, and if we carefully look after  it, makes happiness.    What then is usually done? Men generally act as a traveller would do on  his way to his own country, when he enters a good inn, and being pleased  with it should remain there. Man, you have forgotten your purpose: you  were not travelling to this inn, but you were passing through it. But  this is a pleasant inn. And how many other inns are pleasant? and how  many meadows are pleasant? yet only for passing through. But your  purpose is this, to return to your country, to relieve your kinsmen of  anxiety, to discharge the duties of a citizen, to marry, to beget  children, to fill the usual magistracies. For you are not come to select  more pleasant places, but to live in these where you were born and of  which you were made a citizen. Something of the kind takes place in the  matter which we are considering. Since by the aid of speech and such  communication as you receive here you must advance to perfection, and  purge your will and correct the faculty which makes use of the  appearances of things; and since it is necessary also for the teaching  (delivery) of theorems to be effected by a certain mode of expression  and with a certain variety and sharpness, some persons captivated by  these very things abide in them, one captivated by the expression,  another by syllogisms, another again by sophisms, and still another by  some other inn ([Greek: paudocheiou]) of the kind; and there they stay  and waste away as they were among sirens.    Man, your purpose (business) was to make yourself capable of using  conformably to nature the appearances presented to you, in your desires  not to be frustrated, in your aversion from things not to fall into that  which you would avoid, never to have no luck (as one may say), nor ever  to have bad luck, to be free, not hindered, not compelled, conforming  yourself to the administration of Zeus, obeying it, well satisfied with  this, blaming no one, charging no one with fault, able from your whole  soul to utter these verses:      Lead me, O Zeus, and thou too Destiny.           *       *       *       *       *    TO (OR AGAINST) A PERSON WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT VALUED  (ESTEEMED) BY HIM.--A certain person said to him (Epictetus): Frequently  I desired to hear you and came to you, and you never gave me any answer;  and now, if it is possible, I entreat you to say something to me. Do you  think, said Epictetus, that as there is an art in anything else, so  there is also an art in speaking, and that he who has the art, will  speak skilfully, and he who has not, will speak unskilfully?--I do think  so.--He then who by speaking receives benefit himself, and is able to  benefit others, will speak skilfully; but he who is rather damaged by  speaking and does damage to others, will he be unskilled in this art of  speaking? And you may find that some are damaged and others benefited by  speaking. And are all who hear benefited by what they hear? Or will you  find that among them also some are benefited and some damaged? There are  both among these also, he said. In this case also then those who hear  skilfully are benefited, and those who hear unskilfully are damaged? He  admitted this. Is there then a skill in hearing also, as there is in  speaking? It seems so. If you choose, consider the matter in this way  also. The practice of music, to whom does it belong? To a musician. And  the proper making of a statue, to whom do you think that it belongs? To  a statuary. And the looking at a statue skilfully, does this appear to  you to require the aid of no art? This also requires the aid of art.  Then if speaking properly is the business of the skilful man, do you see  that to hear also with benefit is the business of the skilful man? Now  as to speaking and hearing perfectly, and usefully, let us for the  present, if you please, say no more, for both of us are a long way from  everything of the kind. But I think that every man will allow this, that  he who is going to hear philosophers requires some amount of practice in  hearing. Is it not so?    Why then do you say nothing to me? I can only say this to you, that he  who knows not who he is, and for what purpose he exists, and what is  this world, and with whom he is associated, and what things are the good  and the bad, and the beautiful and the ugly, and who neither understands  discourse nor demonstration, nor what is true nor what is false, and who  is not able to distinguish them, will neither desire according to nature  nor turn away nor move towards, nor intend (to act), nor assent, nor  dissent, nor suspend his judgment: to say all in a few words, he will go  about dumb and blind, thinking that he is somebody, but being nobody. Is  this so now for the first time? Is it not the fact that ever since the  human race existed, all errors and misfortunes have arisen through this  ignorance?    This is all that I have to say to you; and I say even this not  willingly. Why? Because you have not roused me. For what must I look to  in order to be roused, as men who are expert in riding are roused by  generous horses? Must I look to your body? You treat it disgracefully.  To your dress? That is luxurious. To your behavior, to your look? That  is the same as nothing. When you would listen to a philosopher, do not  say to him, You tell me nothing; but only show yourself worthy of  hearing or fit for hearing; and you will see how you will move the  speaker.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT LOGIC IS NECESSARY.--When one of those who were present said,  Persuade me that logic is necessary, he replied, Do you wish me to prove  this to you? The answer was, Yes. Then I must use a demonstrative form  of speech. This was granted. How then will you know if I am cheating you  by my argument? The man was silent. Do you see, said Epictetus, that you  yourself are admitting that logic is necessary, if without it you cannot  know so much as this, whether logic is necessary or not necessary?           *       *       *       *       *    OF FINERY IN DRESS.--A certain young man, a rhetorician, came to see  Epictetus, with his hair dressed more carefully than was usual and his  attire in an ornamental style; whereupon Epictetus said, Tell me if you  do not think that "]]]
