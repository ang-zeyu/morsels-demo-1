I need not say to you, fair  uncle, that I do in course suppose that these secret commissions must  needs be honourable.\"    \"For whom or for what take you me, fair nephew,\" said Balafre, somewhat  sternly; \"I have not been trained, indeed, in the cloister, neither can  I write or read. But I am your mother's brother; I am a loyal Lesly.  Think you that I am like to recommend to you anything unworthy? The best  knight in France, Du Guesclin himself, if he were alive again, might be  proud to number my deeds among his achievements.\"    \"I cannot doubt your warranty, fair uncle,\" said the youth; \"you are the  only adviser my mishap has left me. But is it true, as fame says, that  this King keeps a meagre Court here at his Castle of Plessis? No repair  of nobles or courtiers, none of his grand feudatories in attendance,  none of the high officers of the crown; half solitary sports, shared  only with the menials of his household; secret councils, to which only  low and obscure men are invited; rank and nobility depressed, and men  raised from the lowest origin to the kingly favour--all this seems  unregulated, resembles not the manners of his father, the noble  Charles, who tore from the fangs of the English lion this more than half  conquered kingdom of France.\"    \"You speak like a giddy child,\" said Le Balafre, \"and even as a child,  you harp over the same notes on a new string. Look you: if the King  employs Oliver Dain, his barber, to do what Oliver can do better than  any peer of them all, is not the kingdom the gainer? If he bids his  stout Provost Marshal, Tristan, arrest such or such a seditious burgher,  take off such or such a turbulent noble, the deed is done, and no more  of it; when, were the commission given to a duke or peer of France, he  might perchance send the King back a defiance in exchange. If, again,  the King pleases to give to plain Ludovic le Balafre a commission which  he will execute, instead of employing the High Constable, who would  perhaps betray it, doth it not show wisdom? Above all, doth not a  monarch of such conditions best suit cavaliers of fortune, who must  go where their services are most highly prized, and most frequently  in demand?--No, no, child, I tell thee Louis knows how to choose his  confidants, and what to charge them with; suiting, as they say, the  burden to each man's back. He is not like the King of Castile, who  choked with thirst, because the great butler was not beside to hand his  cup.--But hark to the bell of St. Martin's! I must hasten, back to the  Castle--Farewell--make much of yourself, and at eight tomorrow morning  present yourself before the drawbridge, and ask the sentinel for me.  Take heed you step not off the straight and beaten path in approaching  the portal! There are such traps and snap haunches as may cost you a  limb, which you will sorely miss. You shall see the King, and learn to  judge him for yourself--farewell.\"    So saying, Balafre hastily departed, forgetting, in his hurry, to pay  for the wine he had called for, a shortness of memory incidental to  persons of his description, and which his host, overawed perhaps by the  nodding bonnet and ponderous two handed sword, did not presume to use  any efforts for correcting. It might have been expected that, when left  alone, Durward would have again betaken himself to his turret, in order  to watch for the repetition of those delicious sounds which had soothed  his morning reverie. But that was a chapter of romance, and his uncle's  conversation had opened to him a page of the real history of life.  It was no pleasing one, and for the present the recollections and  reflections which it excited were qualified to overpower other thoughts,  and especially all of a light and soothing nature.    Quentin resorted to a solitary walk along the banks of the rapid Cher,  having previously inquired of his landlord for one which he might  traverse without fear of disagreeable interruption from snares and  pitfalls, and there endeavoured to compose his turmoiled and scattered  thoughts, and consider his future motions, upon which his meeting with  his uncle had thrown some dubiety.        CHAPTER VI: THE BOHEMIANS         Sae rantingly, sae wantingly,       Sae dantingly gaed he,       He play'd a spring and danced a round       Beneath the gallows tree!         OLD SONG      [The Bohemians: In... Guy Mannering the reader will find some remarks  on the gipsies as they are found in Scotland. Their first appearance in  Europe took place in the beginning of the fifteenth century. The account  given by these singular people was, that it was appointed to them, as  a penance, to travel for a certain number of years. Their appearance,  however, and manners, strongly contradicted the allegation that they  travelled from any religious motive. Their dress and accoutrements were  at once showy and squalid; those who acted as captains and leaders of  any horde,... were arrayed in dresses of the most showy colours, such  as scarlet or light green; were well mounted; assumed the title of dukes  and counts, and affected considerable consequence. The rest of the tribe  were most miserable in their diet and apparel, fed without hesitation  on animals which had died of disease, and were clad in filthy and scanty  rags.... Their complexion was positively Eastern, approaching to that of  the Hindoos. Their manners were as depraved as their appearance was poor  and beggarly. The men were in general thieves, and the women of the most  abandoned character. The few arts which they studied with success were  of a slight and idle, though ingenious description. They practised  working in iron, but never upon any great scale. Many were good  sportsmen, good musicians.... But their ingenuity never ascended into  industry.... Their pretensions to read fortunes, by palmistry and by  astrology, acquired them sometimes respect, but oftener drew them under  suspicion as sorcerers; the universal accusation that they augmented  their horde by stealing children, subjected them to doubt and  execration.... The pretension set up by these wanderers, of being  pilgrims in the act of penance, although it... in many instances  obtained them protection from the governments of the countries through  which they travelled, was afterwards totally disbelieved, and they  were considered as incorrigible rogues and vagrants.... A curious and  accurate account of their arrival in France is quoted by Pasquier \"On  August 27th, 1427, came to Paris twelve penitents,... viz. a duke,  an earl, and ten men, all on horseback, and calling themselves good  Christians. They were of Lower Egypt, and gave out that, not long  before, the Christians had subdued their country, and obliged them  to embrace Christianity on pain of being put to death. Those who were  baptized were great lords in their own country, and had a king and queen  there. Soon after their conversion, the Saracens overran the country,  and obliged them to renounce Christianity. When the Emperor of Germany,  the King of Poland, and other Christian princes heard of this, they fell  upon them, and obliged the whole of them, both great and small, to quit  the country, and go to the Pope at Rome, who enjoined them seven years'  penance to wander over the world, without lying in a bed. They had been  wandering five years when they came to Paris first.... Nearly all of  them had their ears bored, and wore two silver rings in each.... The men  were black, their hair curled; the women remarkably black, their only  clothes a large old duffle garment, tied over the shoulders with a  cloth or cord, and under it a miserable rocket;... notwithstanding  their poverty, there were among them women who, by looking into people's  hands, told their fortunes, and what was worse, they picked people's  pockets of their money, and got it into their own, by telling these  things through airy magic, et cetera.\" Pasquier remarks upon this  singular journal that however the story of a penance savours of a trick,  these people wandered up and down France, under the eye, and with the  knowledge, of the magistrates, for more than a hundred years; and it was  not till 1561, that a sentence of banishment was passed against them  in that kingdom. The arrival of the Egyptians (as these singular people  were called) in various parts of Europe, corresponds with the period in  which Timur or Tamerlane invaded Hindostan, affording its natives the  choice between the Koran and death. There can be little doubt that  these wanderers consisted originally of the Hindostanee tribes, who,  displaced, and flying from the sabres of the Mohammedans, undertook this  species of wandering life, without well knowing whither they were going.  When they are in closest contact with the ordinary peasants around  them, they still keep their language a mystery. There is little doubt,  however, that it is a dialect of the Hindostanee, from the specimens  produced by Grellman, Hoyland, and others, who have written on the  subject. S.]    The manner in which Quentin Durward had been educated was not of a kind  to soften the heart, or perhaps to improve the moral feeling. He, with  the rest of his family, had been trained to the chase as an amusement,  and taught to consider war as their only serious occupation, and that it  was the great duty of their lives stubbornly to endure, and fiercely to  retaliate, the attacks of their feudal enemies, by whom their race had  been at last almost annihilated. And yet there mixed with these feuds a  spirit of rude chivalry, and even courtesy, which softened their rigour;  so that revenge, their only justice, was still prosecuted with some  regard to humanity and generosity. The lessons of the worthy old monk,  better attended to, perhaps, during a long illness and adversity, than  they might have been in health and success, had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#15)"],[1,"am at a distance. How can I, therefore,  show my regard for her?' And when Utanka was anxious about this, the man  addressed him and said, 'Ride this horse, Utanka, and he will in a moment  carry thee to thy master's abode.' And Utanka having signified his assent,  mounted the horse and presently reached his preceptor's house.    \"And his preceptress that morning after having bathed was dressing her  hair sitting, thinking of uttering a curse on Utanka if he should not  return within time. But, in the meantime, Utanka entered his preceptor's  abode and paid his respects to his preceptress and presented her the ear-  rings. 'Utanka', said she, 'thou hast arrived at the proper time at the  proper place. Welcome, my child; thou art innocent and therefore I do not  curse thee! Good fortune is even before thee. Let thy wishes be crowned  with success!'    \"Then Utanka waited on his preceptor. And his preceptor said, 'Thou art  welcome! What hath occasioned thy long absence?' And Utanka replied to his  preceptor, 'Sir, in the execution of this my business obstruction was  offered by Takshaka, the King of serpents. Therefore I had to go to the  region of the Nagas. There I saw two damsels sitting at a loom, weaving a  fabric with black and white threads. Pray, what is that? There likewise I  beheld a wheel with twelve spokes ceaselessly turned by six boys. What too  doth that import? Who is also the man that I saw? And what the horse of  extraordinary size likewise beheld by me? And when I was on the road I  also saw a bull with a man mounted thereon, by whom I was endearingly  accosted thus, \"Utanka, eat of the dung of this bull, which was also eaten  by thy master?\" So I ate of the dung of that bull according to his words.  Who also is he? Therefore, enlightened by thee, I desire to hear all about  them.'    \"And his preceptor thus addressed said unto him, 'The two damsels thou  hast seen are Dhata and Vidhata; the black and white threads denote night  and day; the wheel of twelve spokes turned by the six boys signified the  year comprising six seasons. The man is Parjanya, the deity of rain, and  the horse is Agni, the god of fire. The bull that thou hast seen on the  road is Airavata, the king of elephants; the man mounted thereon is Indra;  and the dung of the bull which was eaten by thee was Amrita. It was  certainly for this (last) that thou hast not met with death in the region  of the Nagas; and Indra who is my friend having been mercifully inclined  showed thee favour. It is for this that thou returnest safe, with the ear-  rings about thee. Then, O thou amiable one, I give thee leave to depart.  Thou shall obtain good fortune.'    \"And Utanka, having obtained his master's leave, moved by anger and  resolved to avenge himself on Takshaka, proceeded towards Hastinapura.  That excellent Brahmana soon reached Hastinapura. And Utanka then waited  upon King Janamejaya who had some time before returned victorious from  Takshashila. And Utanka saw the victorious monarch surrounded on all sides  by his ministers. And he pronounced benedictions on him in a proper form.  And Utanka addressed the monarch at the proper moment in speech of correct  accent and melodious sounds, saying, 'O thou the best of monarchs! How is  it that thou spendest thy time like a child when there is another matter  that urgently demandeth thy attention?'\"    Sauti said, \"The monarch Janamejaya, thus addressed, saluting that  excellent Brahmana replied unto him, 'In cherishing these my subjects I do  discharge the duties of my noble tribe. Say, what is that business to be  done by me and which hath brought thee hither.'    \"The foremost of Brahmanas and distinguished beyond all for good deeds,  thus addressed by the excellent monarch of large heart, replied unto him,  'O King! the business is thy own that demandeth thy attention; therefore  do it, please. O thou King of kings! Thy father was deprived of life by  Takshaka; therefore do thou avenge thy father's death on that vile serpent.  The time hath come, I think, for the act of vengeance ordained by the  Fates. Go then avenge the death of thy magnanimous father who, being  bitten without cause by that vile serpent, was reduced to five elements  even like a tree stricken by thunder. The wicked Takshaka, vilest of the  serpent race, intoxicated with power committed an unnecessary act when he  bit the King, that god-like father, the protector of the race of royal  saints. Wicked in his deeds, he even caused Kasyapa (the prince of  physicians) to run back when he was coming for the relief of thy father.  It behoveth thee to burn the wicked wretch in the blazing fire of a snake-  sacrifice. O King! Give instant orders for the sacrifice. It is thus thou  canst avenge the death of thy father. And a very great favour shall have  also been shown to me. For by that malignant wretch, O virtuous Prince, my  business also was, on one occasion, obstructed, while proceeding on  account of my preceptor.'\"    Sauti continued, \"The monarch, having heard these words, was enraged with  Takshaka. By the speech of Utanka was inflamed the prince, even as the  sacrificial fire with clarified butter. Moved by grief also, in the  presence of Utanka, the prince asked his ministers the particulars of his  father's journey to the regions of the blessed. And when he heard all  about the circumstances of his father's death from the lips of Utanka, he  was overcome with pain and sorrow.\"    And thus endeth the section called Paushya of the Adi Parva of the blessed  Mahabharata.      SECTION IV    (Pauloma Parva)    Ugrasrava Sauti, the son of Lomaharshana, versed in the Puranas, while  present in the forest of Naimisha, at the twelve years' sacrifice of  Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, stood before the Rishis in attendance. Having  studied Puranas with meticulous devotion and thus being thoroughly  acquainted with them, he addressed them with joined hands thus, \"I have  graphically described to you the history of Utanka which is one of the  causes of King Janamejaya's Snake-sacrifice. What, revered Sirs, do ye  wish to hear now? What shall I relate to you?\" The holy men replied, \"O  son of Lomaharshana, we shall ask thee about what we are anxious to hear  and thou wilt recount the tales one by one. Saunaka, our revered master,  is at present attending the apartment of the holy fire. He is acquainted  with those divine stories which relate to the gods and asuras. He  adequately knoweth the histories of men, serpents, and Gandharvas. Further,  O Sauti, in this sacrifice that learned Brahmana is the chief. He is able,  faithful to his vows, wise, a master of the Sastras and the Aranyaka, a  speaker of truth, a lover of peace, a mortifier of the flesh, and an  observer of the penances according to the authoritative decrees. He is  respected by us all. It behoveth us therefore to wait for him. And when he  is seated on his highly respected seat, thou wilt answer what that best of  Dwijas shall ask of thee.\"    Sauti said, \"Be it so. And when the high-souled master hath been seated I  shall narrate, questioned by him, sacred stories on a variety of subjects.\"  After a while that excellent Brahmana (Saunaka) having duly finished all  his duties, and having propitiated the gods with prayers and the manes  with oblations of water, came back to the place of sacrifice, where with  Sauti seated before was the assembly of saints of rigid vows sitting at  ease. And when Saunaka was seated in the midst of the Ritwiks and Sadhyas,  who were also in their seats, he spake as followeth.      SECTION V    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Saunaka said, \"Child, thy father formerly read the whole of the Puranas,  O son of Lomaharshana, and the Bharata with Krishna-Dwaipayana. Hast thou  also made them thy study? In those ancient records are chronicled  interesting stories and the history of the first generations of the wise  men, all of which we heard being rehearsed by thy sire. In the first place,  I am desirous of hearing the history of the race of Bhrigu. Recount thou  that history, we shall attentively listen to thee.\"    Sauti answered, \"By me hath been acquired all that was formerly studied  by the high-souled Brahmanas including Vaisampayana and repeated by them;  by me hath been acquired all that had been studied by my father. O  descendant of the Bhrigu race, attend then to so much as relateth to the  exalted race of Bhrigu, revered by Indra and all the gods, by the tribes  of Rishis and Maruts (Winds). O great Muni, I shall first properly recount  the story of this family, as told in the Puranas.    \"The great and blessed saint Bhrigu, we are informed, was produced by the  self-existing Brahma from the fire at the sacrifice of Varuna. And Bhrigu  had a son, named Chyavana, whom he dearly loved. And to Chyavana was born  a virtuous son called Pramati. And Pramati had a son named Ruru by  Ghritachi (the celestial dancer). And to Ruru also by his wife Pramadvara,  was born a son, whose name was Sunaka. He was, O Saunaka, thy great  ancestor exceedingly virtuous in his ways. He was devoted to asceticism,  of great reputation, proficient in law, and eminent among those having a  knowledge of the Vedas. He was virtuous, truthful, and of well-regulated  fare.\"    Saunaka said, \"O son of Suta, I ask thee why the illustrious son of  Bhrigu was named Chyavana. Do tell me all.\"    Sauti replied, \"Bhrigu had a wife named Puloma whom he dearly loved. She  became big with child by Bhrigu. And one day while the virtuous continent  Puloma was in that condition, Bhrigu, great among those that are true to  their religion, leaving her at home went out to perform his ablutions. It  was then that the Rakshasa called Puloma came to Bhrigu's abode. And  entering the Rishi's abode, the Rakshasa saw the wife of Bhrigu,  irreproachable in everything. And seeing her he became filled with lust  and lost his senses. The beautiful Puloma entertained the Rakshasa"]]]
