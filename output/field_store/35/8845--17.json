He  had caught hundreds--thousands--and had sold them well. But now nothing  but pigeons would they have. Pigeons! Always pigeons! He caught  starlings still, but what was the good of that? The dealers would only  take a few, and they were worth nothing--no more than greenfinches and  yellow-hammers.    My colloquy with my enemy on the common tempts me to a fresh digression  in this place--to have my say on a question about which much has already  been said during the last three or four decades, especially during the  'sixties, when the first practical efforts to save our wild-bird life  from destruction were made.    There is a feeling in the great mass of people that the pursuit of any  wild animal, whether fit for food or not, for pleasure or gain, is a  form of sport, and that sport ought not to be interfered with. So strong  and well-nigh universal is this feeling, which is like a superstition,  that the pursuit is not interfered with, however unsportsmanlike it may  be, and when illegal, and when practised by only a very few persons in  any district, where to others it may be secretly distasteful or even  prejudicial.    Even bird-catching on a common is regarded as a form of sport and the  bird-catcher as a sportsman--and a brother.    A striking instance of this tameness and stupidly acquiescent spirit in  people generally was witnessed during the intensely severe frosts of the  early part of the late winter (1882-3), when incalculable numbers of  sea-birds were driven by hunger and cold into bays and inland waters. At  this time thousands of gulls made their appearance in the Thames, but no  sooner did they arrive than those who possessed guns and licences to  shoot began to shoot them. The police interfered and some of these  sportsmen were brought before the magistrates and fined for the offence  of discharging guns to the public danger. For upwards of a fortnight  after the shooting had been put a stop to, the gulls continued to  frequent the river in large numbers, and were perhaps most numerous from  London Bridge to Battersea, and during this time they were watched every  day by thousands of Londoners with keen interest and pleasure. The river  here, flowing through the very centre and heart of the greatest city of  the world, forms at all hours and at all seasons of the year a noble and  magnificent sight; to my eyes it never looked more beautiful and  wonderful than during those intensely cold days of January, when there  was nothing that one could call a mist in a chilly, motionless  atmosphere, but only a faint haze, a pallor as of impalpable frost,  which made the heavens seem more white than blue, and gave a hoariness  and cloud-like remoteness to the arches spanning the water, and the vast  buildings on either side, ending with the sublime dome of the city  cathedral; and when out of the pale motionless haze, singly, in twos and  threes, in dozens and scores, floated the mysterious white bird-figures,  first seen like vague shadows in the sky, then quickly taking shape and  whiteness, and floating serenely past, to be succeeded by others and yet  others.    It was not merely the ornithologist in me that made the sight so  fascinating, since it was found that others--all others, it might almost  be said,--experienced the same kind of delight.  Crowds of people came  down to the river to watch the birds; workmen when released from their  work at mid-day hurried down to the embankment so as to enjoy seeing the  gulls while eating their dinners, and, strangest thing of all, to feed  them with the fragments!    And yet these very men who found so great a pleasure in observing and  feeding their white visitors from the sea, and were exhilarated with the  novel experiences of seeing wild nature face to face at their own  doors--these thousands would have stood by silent and consenting if the  half-a-dozen scoundrels with guns and fish-hooks on lines had been  allowed to have their will and had slaughtered and driven the birds from  the river! And this, in fact, is precisely what happened at a distance  from London, where guns could be discharged without danger to the  public, in numberless bays and rivers in which the birds sought refuge.  They were simply slaughtered wholesale in the most wanton manner; in  Morecambe Bay a hundred and twelve gulls were killed at one discharge,  and no hand and no voice was raised to interfere with the hideous sport.  Not because it was not shocking to the spectators, but because it was  \"Sport.\"    Doubtless it will be said that this wholesale wanton destruction of bird  life, however painful it may be to lovers of nature, however  reprehensible from a moral point of view, is sanctioned by law, and  cannot therefore be prevented. This is not quite so. We see that the  Wild Birds Protection Act is continually being broken with impunity, and  where public opinion is unfavourable to it the guardians of the law  themselves, the police and the magistrates, are found encouraging the  people to break the law. Again, we find that where commons are enclosed,  and the law says nothing, the people are accustomed to assemble together  unlawfully to tear the fences down, and are not punished. For, after  all, if laws do not express or square with public will or opinion, they  have little force; and if, in any locality, the people thought proper to  do so--if they were not restrained by that dull, tame spirit I have  spoken of--they would, lawfully or unlawfully, protect their sea-fowl  from the cockney sportsmen, and sweep the bird-catchers out of their  lanes and waste lands.    One day I paid a visit to Maidenhead, a pleasant town on the Thames,  where the Thames is most beautiful, set in the midst of a rich and  diversified country which should be a bird's paradise. In my walks in  the town, I saw a great many stuffed kingfishers, and, in the shops of  the local taxidermists, some rare and beautiful birds, with others that  are fast becoming rare. But outside of the town I saw no kingfishers and  no rare species at all, and comparatively few birds of any kind. It  might have been a town of Philistine cockneys who at no very distant  period had emigrated thither from the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.  I came home with the local guide-book in my pocket. It is now before me,  and this is what its writer says of the Thicket, the extensive and  beautiful common two miles from the town, which belongs to Maidenhead,  or, in other words, to its inhabitants: \"The Thicket was formerly much  infested by robbers and highwaymen. The only remains of them to be found  now are the snarers of the little feathered songsters, who imprison them  in tiny cages and carry them off in large numbers to brighten by their  sweet, sad sighs for liberty the dwellers in our smoky cities.\"    On this point I consulted a bird-catcher, who had spread his nets on the  common for many years, and he complained bitterly of the increasing  scarcity of its bird life. There was no better place than the Thicket  formerly, he said; but now he could hardly make his bread there. I  presume that a dozen men of his trade would be well able to drain the  country in the neighbourhood of the Thicket of the greater portion of  its bird life each year so as to keep the songsters scarce. Will any  person maintain for a moment that the eight or nine thousand inhabitants  of Maidenhead, and the hundreds or thousands inhabiting the surrounding  country could not protect their songbirds from these few men, most of  them out of London slums, if they wished or had the spirit to do so?    It is true that the local authorities in some country towns have made  by-laws to protect the birds in their open spaces. Thus, at Tunbridge  Wells, since 1890, bird-trapping and bird's-nesting have been prohibited  on the large and beautiful common there; but, so far as I know, such  measures have only been taken in boroughs after the birds have been  almost exterminated.    Doubtless the day will come when, law or no law, the bird-catcher will  find it necessary to go warily, lest the people of any place where he  may be tempted to spread his nets should have formed the custom of  treating those of his calling somewhat roughly. That it will come soon  is earnestly to be wished. Nevertheless, it would be irrational to  cherish feelings of animosity and hatred against the bird-catcher  himself, the \"man and brother,\" ready and anxious as we may be to take  the bread out of his mouth. He certainly does not regard himself as an  injurious or disreputable person; on the contrary he looks on himself as  a useful member of the community, and in some cases even more. If anyone  is to be hated or blamed, it is the person who sends the bird-catcher  into the fields; not the dealer, but he who buys trapped birds and keeps  them in cages to be amused by their twitterings. This is not a question  of morality, nor of sentimentality, as some may imagine; but rather of  taste, of the sense of fitness, of that something vaguely described as  the feeling for nature, which is not universal. Thus, one man will dine  with zest on a pheasant, partridge, or quail, but would be choked by a  lark; while another man will eat pheasant and lark with equal pleasure.  Both may be good, honest, moral men; only one has that something which  the other lacks. In one the soul responds to the skylark's music  \"singing at heaven's gate,\" in the other not; to one the roasted lark is  merely a savoury morsel; the other, be he never so hungry, cannot  dissociate the bird on the dish from that heavenly melody which  registered a sensation in his brain, to be thereafter reproduced at  will, together with the revived emotion. It is a curious question, and  is no nearer to a settlement when one of these two I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#15)"],[1,"this green earth for a dwellingplace. But when I remembered my own  brutal bull of Bashan performance, my face, there in the dark, was on  fire with shame; and I cursed the ignorant, presumptuous folly I had  been guilty of in roaring out that abominable \"Vicar of Bray\" ballad,  which had now become as hateful to me as my trousers or boots. The  composer of that song, the writer of the words, and its subject, the  double-faced Vicar himself, presented themselves to my mind as the three  most damnable beings that had ever existed. \"The devil take my luck!\" I  muttered, grinding my teeth with impotent anger; for it seemed such hard  lines, just when I had succeeded in getting into favor, to go and spoil  it all in that unhappy way. Now that I had become acquainted with their  style of singing, the supposed fib, about which there had been such a  pother, seemed a very venial offense compared with my attempt to lead  the singing. Nevertheless, when the concert was over, not a word was  said on the subject by any one, though I had quite expected to be taken  at once to the magisterial chamber to hear some dreadful sentence passed  on me; and when, before retiring, anxious to propitiate my host, I began  to express regret for having inflicted pain on them by attempting to  sing, the venerable gentleman raised his hands deprecatingly, and begged  me to say no more about it, for painful subjects were best forgotten.  \"No doubt,\" he kindly added, \"when you were lying there buried among the  hills, you swallowed a large amount of earth and gravel in your efforts  to breathe, and have not yet freed your lungs from it.\"    This was the most charitable view he could take of the matter, and I was  thankful that no worse result followed.              Chapter 10    At length the joyful day arrived when I was to cease, in outward  appearance at all events, to be an alien; for returning at noon from the  fields, on entering my cell I beheld my beautiful new garments--two  complete suits, besides underwear: one, the most soberly colored,  intended only for working hours; but the second, which was for the  house, claimed my first attention. Trembling with eagerness, I flung off  the old tweeds, the cracked boots, and other vestiges of a civilization  which they had perhaps survived, and soon found that I had been measured  with faultless accuracy; for everything, down to the shoes, fitted to  perfection. Green was the prevailing or ground tint--a soft sap green;  the pattern on it, which was very beautiful, being a somewhat obscure  red, inclining to purple. My delight culminated when I drew on the hose,  which had, like those worn by the others, a curious design, evidently  borrowed from the skin of some kind of snake. The ground color was light  green, almost citron yellow, in fact, and the pattern a bright maroon  red, with bronze reflections.    I had no sooner arrayed myself than, with a flushed face and palpitating  heart, I flew to exhibit myself to my friends, and found them assembled  and waiting to see and admire the result of their work. The pleasure I  saw reflected in their transparent faces increased my happiness a  hundredfold, and I quite astonished them with the torrent of eloquence  in which I expressed my overflowing gratitude.    \"Now, tell me one secret,\" I exclaimed, when the excitement began to  abate a little. \"Why is green the principal color in my clothes, when no  other person in the house wears more than a very little of it?\"    I had no sooner spoken than I heartily wished that I had held my peace;  for it all at once occurred to me that green was perhaps the color for  an alien or mere hireling, in which light they perhaps regarded me.    \"Oh, Smith, can you not guess so simple a thing?\" said Edra, placing her  white hands on my shoulders and smiling straight into my face.    How beautiful she looked, standing there with her eyes so near to mine!  \"Tell me why, Edra?\" I said, still with a lingering apprehension.    \"Why, look at the color of my eyes and skin--would this green tint be  suitable for me to wear?\"    \"Oh, is that the reason!\" cried I, immensely relieved. \"I think, Edra,  you would look very beautiful in any color that is on the earth, or in  the rainbow above the earth. But am I so different from you all?\"    \"Oh yes, quite different--have you never looked at yourself? Your skin  is whiter and redder, and your hair has a very different color. It will  look better when it grows long, I think. And your eyes--do you know that  they never change! for when we look at you closely they are still  blue-gray, and not green.\"    \"No; I wish they were,\" said I. \"Now I shall value my clothes a hundred  times more, since you have taken so much pains to make them--well, what  shall I say?--harmonize, I suppose, with the peculiar color of my mug.  Dash it all, I'm blundering again! I mean--I mean--don't you know----\"    Edra laughed and gave it up. Then we all laughed; for now evidently my  blundering did not so much matter, since I had shed my outer integument,  and come forth like a snake (with a divided tail) in a brand new skin.    Presently I missed Yoletta from the room, and desiring above all things  to have some word of congratulation from her lips, I went off to seek  her. She was standing under the portico waiting for me. \"Come,\" she  said, and proceeded to lead me into the music-room, where we sat down on  one of the couches close to the dais; there she produced some large  white tablets, and red chalk pencils or crayons.    \"Now, Smith, I am going to begin teaching you,\" said she, with the grave  air of a young schoolmistress; \"and every afternoon, when your work is  done, you must come to me here.\"    \"I hope I am very stupid, and that it will take me a long time to  learn,\" said I.    \"Oh\"--she laughed--\"do you think it will be so pleasant sitting by me  here? I am glad you think that; but if you prefer me for a teacher you  must not try to be stupid, because if you do I shall ask some one else  to take my place.\"    \"Would you really do that, Yoletta?\"    \"Yes. Shall I tell you why? Because I have a quick, impatient temper.  Everything wrong I have ever done, for which I have been punished, has  been through my hasty temper.\"    \"And have you ever undergone that sad punishment of being shut up by  yourself for many days, Yoletta?\"    \"Yes, often; for what other punishment is there? But oh, I hope it will  never happen again, because I think--I know that I suffer more than any  one can imagine. To tread on the grass, to feel the sun and wind on my  face, to see the earth and sky and animals--this is like life to me; and  when I am shut up alone, every day seems--oh, a year at least!\" She did  not know how much dearer this confession of one little human weakness  made her seem to me. \"Come, let us begin,\" she said. \"I waited for your  new clothes to be finished, and we must make up for lost time.\"    \"But do you know, Yoletta, that you have not said anything about them?  Do I look nice; and will you like me any better now?\"    \"Yes, much better. You were a poor caterpillar before; I liked you a  little because I knew what a pretty butterfly you would be in time. I  helped to make your wings. Now, listen.\"    For two hours she taught me, making her red letters or marks, which I  copied on my tablet, and explaining them to me; and at the conclusion of  the lesson, I had got a general idea that the writing was to a great  extent phonographic, and that I was in for rather a tough job.    \"Do you think that you will be able to teach me to sing also?\" I asked,  when she had put the tablets aside.    The memory of that miserable failure, when I \"had led the singing,\" was  a constant sore in my mind. I had begun to think that I had not done  myself justice on that memorable occasion, and the desire to make  another trial under more favorable circumstances was very strong in me.    She looked a little startled at my question, but said nothing.    \"I know now,\" I continued pleadingly, \"that you all sing softly. If you  will only consent to try me once I promise to stick like cobbler's  wax--I beg your pardon, I mean I will endeavor to adhere to the morendo  and perdendosi style--don't you know? What am I saying! But I promise  you, Yoletta, I shan't frighten you, if you will only let me try and  sing to you once.\"    She turned from me with a somewhat clouded expression of face, and  walked with slow steps to the dais, and placing her hands on the keys,  caused two of the small globes to revolve, sending soft waves of sound  through the room.    I advanced towards her, but she raised her hand apprehensively. \"No, no,  no; stand there,\" she said, \"and sing low.\"    It was hard to see her troubled face and obey, but I was not going to  bellow at her like a bull, and I had set my heart on this trial. For the  last three days, while working in the fields, I had been incessantly  practicing my dear old master Campana's exquisite _M'appar sulla  tomba_, the only melody I happened to know which had any resemblance  to their divine music. To my surprise she seemed to play as I sang a  suitable accompaniment on the globes, which aided and encouraged me,  and, although singing in a subdued tone, I felt that I had never sung so  well before. When I finished, I quite expected some word of praise, or  to be asked why I had not sung this melody on that unhappy evening when  I was asked to lead; but she spoke no word.    \"Will you sing something now?\" I said.    \"Not now--this evening,\" she replied absently, slowly walking across the  floor with eyes cast down.    \"What are you thinking of, Yoletta, that you look so serious?\" I asked.    \"Nothing,\" she returned, a little impatiently.    \"You look very solemn about nothing, then. But you have not said one  word about my singing--did you not like it?\"    \"Your singing? Oh no! It was a pleasant-tasting little kernel in a very  rough rind--I should like one"]]]
