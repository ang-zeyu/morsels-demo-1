And half he watched a thorn tree ahead as he plowed  and half he took in the whole hill sloping south and the wide lands  below it, far beyond which was the sea. They had a railway now down in  the valley. The sunlight glittering near the end of winter shone on a  train that was marked with great white squares and red crosses on  them.    John Plowman stopped his horses and looked at the train. \"An  ambulance train,\" he said, \"coming up from the coast.\" He thought  of the lads he knew and wondered if any were there. He pitied the men  in that train and envied them. And then there came to him the thought  of England's cause and of how those men had upheld it, at sea and in  crumbling cities. He thought of the battle whose echoes reached  sometimes to that field, whispering to furrows and thorn trees that  had never heard them before. He thought of the accursed tyrant's cruel  might, and of the lads that had faced it. He saw the romantic  splendour of England's cause. He was old but had seen the glamour for  which each generation looked. Satisfied in his heart and cheered with  a new content he went on with his age-old task in the business of man  with the hills."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#15)"],[1,"nose\"  --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the  handkerchief again)--\"beware of  traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs;  always walk upon your hind legs.\"  Pigling Bland who was a sedate  little pig, looked solemnly at his  mother, a tear trickled down his  cheek.    Aunt Pettitoes turned to the  other--\"Now son Alexander take  the hand\"--\"Wee, wee, wee!\"  giggled Alexander--\"take the hand of  your brother Pigling Bland, you  must go to market. Mind--\" \"Wee,  wee, wee!\" interrupted Alexander  again. \"You put me out,\" said Aunt  Pettitoes--\"Observe signposts and  milestones; do not gobble herring  bones--\" \"And remember,\" said I  impressively, \"if you once cross the  county boundary you cannot come  back. Alexander, you are not  attending. Here are two licenses  permitting two pigs to go to market in  Lancashire. Attend Alexander. I  have had no end of trouble in getting  these papers from the policeman.\"  Pigling Bland listened  gravely; Alexander was hopelessly  volatile.    I pinned the papers, for safety,  inside their waistcoat pockets;  Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little  bundle, and eight conversation  peppermints with appropriate  moral sentiments in screws of  paper. Then they started.    Pigling Bland and Alexander  trotted along steadily for a mile; at  least Pigling Bland did. Alexander  made the road half as long again  by skipping from side to side. He  danced about and pinched his  brother, singing--         \"This pig went to market, this pig stayed            at home,       \"This pig had a bit of meat--    let's see what they have given US for  dinner, Pigling?\"    Pigling Bland and Alexander sat  down and untied their bundles.  Alexander gobbled up his dinner in  no time; he had already eaten all  his own peppermints--\"Give me  one of yours, please, Pigling?\" \"But  I wish to preserve them for  emergencies,\" said Pigling Bland  doubtfully. Alexander went into squeals  of laughter. Then he pricked Pigling  with the pin that had fastened  his pig paper; and when Pigling  slapped him he dropped the pin,  and tried to take Pigling's pin, and  the papers got mixed up. Pigling  Bland reproved Alexander.    But presently they made it up  again, and trotted away together,  singing--         \"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig            and away he ran!       \"But all the tune that he could play, was            `Over the hills and far away!'\"      \"What's that, young Sirs? Stole a  pig? Where are your licenses?\" said  the policeman. They had nearly run  against him round a corner. Pigling  Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander,  after fumbling, handed over  something scrumply--    \"To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties  at three farthings\"--\"What's this?  this ain't a license?\" Alexander's  nose lengthened visibly, he had lost  it. \"I had one, indeed I had, Mr.  Policeman!\"      \"It's not likely they let you start  without. I am passing the farm.  You may walk with me.\" \"Can I  come back too?\" inquired Pigling  Bland. \"I see no reason, young Sir;  your paper is all right.\" Pigling  Bland did not like going on alone,  and it was beginning to rain. But it  is unwise to argue with the police;  he gave his brother a peppermint,  and watched him out of sight.    To conclude the adventures of  Alexander--the policeman sauntered  up to the house about tea  time, followed by a damp subdued  little pig. I disposed of Alexander in  the neighborhood; he did fairly  well when he had settled down.    Pigling Bland went on alone  dejectedly; he came to cross roads and  a sign-post--\"To Market-town 5  miles,\" \"Over the Hills, 4 miles,\"  \"To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles.\"    Pigling Bland was shocked, there  was little hope of sleeping in Market  Town, and tomorrow was the  hiring fair; it was deplorable to  think how much time had been  wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.    He glanced wistfully along the  road towards the hills, and then set  off walking obediently the other  way, buttoning up his coat against  the rain. He had never wanted to  go; and the idea of standing all by  himself in a crowded market, to be  stared at, pushed, and hired by  some big strange farmer was very  disagreeable--    \"I wish I could have a little garden  and grow potatoes,\" said Pigling  Bland.    He put his cold hand in his  pocket and felt his paper, he put his  other hand in his other pocket and  felt another paper--Alexander's!  Pigling squealed; then ran back  frantically, hoping to overtake  Alexander and the policeman.    He took a wrong turn--several  wrong turns, and was quite lost.    It grew dark, the wind whistled,  the trees creaked and groaned.    Pigling Bland became frightened  and cried \"Wee, wee, wee! I can't  find my way home!\"    After an hour's wandering he got  out of the wood; the moon shone  through the clouds, and Pigling  Bland saw a country that was new  to him.    The road crossed a moor; below  was a wide valley with a river twinkling  in the moonlight, and beyond  --in misty distance--lay the hills.    He saw a small wooden hut,  made his way to it, and crept inside  --\"I am afraid it IS a hen house,  but what can I do?\" said Pigling  Bland, wet and cold and quite tired  out.      \"Bacon and eggs, bacon and  eggs!\" clucked a hen on a perch.    \"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle,  cackle!\" scolded the disturbed  cockerel. \"To market, to market!  jiggettyjig!\" clucked a broody white  hen roosting next to him. Pigling  Bland, much alarmed, determined  to leave at daybreak. In the meantime,  he and the hens fell asleep.    In less than an hour they were all  awakened. The owner, Mr. Peter  Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern  and a hamper to catch six  fowls to take to market in the  morning.    He grabbed the white hen roosting  next to the cock; then his eye  fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed  up in a corner. He made a singular  remark--\"Hallo, here's another!\"  --seized Pigling by the scruff of the  neck, and dropped him into the  hamper. Then he dropped in five  more dirty, kicking, cackling hens  upon the top of Pigling Bland.    The hamper containing six fowls  and a young pig was no light  weight; it was taken down hill,  unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling,  although nearly scratched to pieces,  contrived to hide the papers and  peppermints inside his clothes.    At last the hamper was bumped  down upon a kitchen floor, the lid  was opened, and Pigling was lifted  out. He looked up, blinking, and  saw an offensively ugly elderly  man, grinning from ear to ear.    \"This one's come of himself,  whatever,\" said Mr. Piperson, turning  Pigling's pockets inside out. He  pushed the hamper into a corner,  threw a sack over it to keep the  hens quiet, put a pot on the fire,  and unlaced his boots.    Pigling Bland drew forward a  coppy stool, and sat on the edge of  it, shyly warming his hands. Mr.  Piperson pulled off a boot and  threw it against the wainscot at the  further end of the kitchen. There  was a smothered noise--\"Shut  up!\" said Mr. Piperson. Pigling  Bland warmed his hands, and eyed  him.    Mr. Piperson pulled off the other  boot and flung it after the first,  there was again a curious noise--  \"Be quiet, will ye?\" said Mr. Piperson.  Pigling Bland sat on the very  edge of the coppy stool.    Mr. Piperson fetched meal from  a chest and made porridge, it  seemed to Pigling that something  at the further end of the kitchen  was taking a suppressed interest in  the cooking; but he was too hungry  to be troubled by noises.    Mr. Piperson poured out three  platefuls: for himself, for Pigling,  and a third-after glaring at Pigling--  he put away with much scuffling,  and locked up. Pigling Bland  ate his supper discreetly.    After supper Mr. Piperson consulted  an almanac, and felt Pigling's  ribs; it was too late in the  season for curing bacon, and he  grudged his meal. Besides, the hens  had seen this pig.    He looked at the small remains  of a flitch [side of bacon], and then  looked undecidedly at Pigling. \"You  may sleep on the rug,\" said Mr.  Peter Thomas Piperson.    Pigling Bland slept like a top. In  the morning Mr. Piperson made  more porridge; the weather was  warmer. He looked how much  meal was left in the chest, and  seemed dissatisfied--\"You'll likely  be moving on again?\" said he to  Pigling Bland.    Before Pigling could reply, a  neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson  and the hens a lift, whistled  from the gate. Mr. Piperson hurried  out with the hamper, enjoining  Pigling to shut the door behind him  and not meddle with nought; or  \"I'll come back and skin ye!\" said  Mr. Piperson.    It crossed Pigling's mind that if  HE had asked for a lift, too, he  might still have been in time for  market.    But he distrusted Peter Thomas.    After finishing breakfast at his  leisure, Pigling had a look round  the cottage; everything was locked  up. He found some potato peelings  in a bucket in the back kitchen.  Pigling ate the peel, and washed up  the porridge plates in the bucket.  He sang while he worked--         \"Tom with his pipe made such a noise,       He called up all the girls and boys--       \"And they all ran to hear him play,            \"Over the hills and far away!--\"    Suddenly a little smothered voice  chimed in--         \"Over the hills and a great way off,       The wind shall blow my top knot            off.\"    Pigling Bland put down a plate  which he was wiping, and listened.    After a long pause, Pigling went  on tiptoe and peeped round the  door into the front kitchen; there  was nobody there.    After another pause, Pigling  approached the door of the locked  cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole.  It was quite quiet.    After another long pause, Pigling  pushed a peppermint under the  door. It was sucked in immediately.    In the course of the day Pigling  pushed in all his remaining six  peppermints.    When Mr. Piperson returned, he  found Pigling sitting before the fire;  he had brushed up the hearth and  put on the pot to boil; the meal was  not get-at-able.    Mr."]]]
