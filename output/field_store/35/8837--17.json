[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#15)"],[1," is a sacred spring. If you will come  with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's  country. Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward  you, too. But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to  accept something at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you  would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and  the famous pot and spoon which you possess.' With these in your  possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a  man has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished  mansion will be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will  supply him with all manner of the rarest and most delicious foods.\"    Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and  prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. \"O master!\"  exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do.  \"What shall we do? Where shall we go?\"    \"Wait for me here,\" he replied. \"I am not going far. I shall not be  long away.\" On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to  sight.    \"Now what shall we do?\" said the dog to the cat.    \"We must remain here,\" replied the cat, \"as our master ordered. Do not  be anxious about food. I will go to the people's houses and get plenty  of food for both of us.\" And so the cat did, and they both lived very  comfortably till their master came again and joined them.    The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and  information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness  commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake  refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was  released from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible  death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and  embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his  dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he  received the Raja's right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in  recognition of His Highness's gratitude to him for having delivered  his son. He then returned. On reaching the top of the spring he found  his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting for him. They told one  another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other,  and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together to the river  side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and  pot and spoon.    The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful  house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the  pot and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were  provided for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very  happily for several years, until one morning the princess, while  arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed  and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window. The  reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by  the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden  hair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked  himself up in his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen  desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and  refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to  him. The king, his father, was in great distress about the matter, and  did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave  him without an heir. At last he determined to seek the counsel of his  aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and  bade him not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed  in getting the beautiful woman for his son's wife.    She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing,  and buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful  princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a  stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful  princess and said, \"I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before,  because I left the country just after your birth.\" She also embraced  and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The  beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's  embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she  could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress  thought to herself, \"I shall soon accomplish my errand.\" When she had  been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring,  and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter  was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and  might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband  for the ring, and he readily gave it to her.    The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious  thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the  ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away  with it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point  of death. \"Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,\" she said to him. \"The  woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the  charm, whereby you may bring her before you.\" The prince was almost  mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing  the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the  house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace  garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful  princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no  escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he  would wait one month for her.    Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was  terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the  place only, just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring  which Raja Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put  an end to himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone  away and hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything  disappear. \"O master!\" they said, \"stay your hand. Your trial is  great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and  try to recover your wife and house.\"    \"Go,\" said he, \"and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my  wife, and I shall live.\"    So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they  reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.  \"We may have some difficulty here,\" said the cat. \"Look, the king has  taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will  go to the house and try to see her.\" So the dog sat down, and the cat  climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess  was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and  informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them.    \"But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?\" she  asked.    \"Yes,\" replied the cat, \"if you can tell me where the charmed ring  is.\"    \"The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,\" she said.    \"All right,\" said the cat, \"I will recover it. If we once get it,  everything is ours.\" Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and  went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at  that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat  community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were  assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.  The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The  cat got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the  bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently,  when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping  in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and  pounced down on him. \"Oh! let me go, let me go,\" cried the terrified  rat. \"Oh! let him go,\" squealed all the company. \"It is his wedding  day.\"    \"No, no,\" replied the cat. \"Not unless you do something for me.  Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his  wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will  procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do  not, then your prince dies under my feet.\"    \"Very well, we agree,\" said they all. \"Nay, if we do not get the ring  for you, devour us all.\"    [Illustration: THE CHARMED RING]    This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the  thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats  went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail  into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring  came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the  precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and  went at once to the cat and released its son.    As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to  go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They  had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the  house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything  would go on as happily as before. \"How glad master will be!\" they  thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the  way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its  back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring,  and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it  up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at  once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it.    \"Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?\" said the dog.    \"What is done is done,\" replied the cat. \"We must try to recover it,  and if we do not succeed we had better drown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#15)"],[1,"le. The  Greek Emperor, on his part, thought it compatible neither with his  dignity nor his safety to seek the German, and several days were spent  in insincere negotiations. Manuel at length agreed to furnish the  crusading army with guides to conduct it through Asia Minor; and Conrad  passed over the Hellespont with his forces, the advanced guard being  commanded by himself, and the rear by the warlike Bishop of Freysinghen.    Historians are almost unanimous in their belief that the wily Greek  gave instructions to his guides to lead the army of the German Emperor  into dangers and difficulties. It is certain, that instead of guiding  them through such districts of Asia Minor as afforded water and  provisions, they led them into the wilds of Cappadocia, where neither  was to be procured, and where they were suddenly attacked by the  Sultaun of the Seljukian Turks, at the head of an immense force.  The  guides, whose treachery is apparent from this fact alone, fled at the  first sight of the Turkish army, and the Christians were left to wage  unequal warfare with their enemy, entangled and bewildered in desert  wilds. Toiling in their heavy mail, the Germans could make but little  effective resistance to the attacks of the Turkish light horse, who  were down upon them one instant, and out of sight the next. Now in the  front and now in the rear, the agile foe showered his arrows upon them,  enticing them into swamps and hollows, from which they could only  extricate themselves after long struggles and great losses. The  Germans, confounded by this mode of warfare, lost all conception of the  direction they were pursuing, and went back instead of forward.  Suffering at the same time for want of provisions, they fell an easy  prey to their pursuers. Count Bernhard, one of the bravest leaders of  the German expedition, was surrounded, with his whole division, not one  of whom escaped the Turkish arrows. The Emperor himself had nearly  fallen a victim, and was twice severely wounded. So persevering was the  enemy, and so little able were the Germans to make even a show of  resistance, that when Conrad at last reached the city of Nice, he found  that, instead of being at the head of an imposing force of one hundred  thousand foot and seventy thousand horse, he had but fifty or sixty  thousand men, and these in the most worn and wearied condition.    Totally ignorant of the treachery of the Greek Emperor, although he had  been warned to beware of it, Louis VII. proceeded, at the head of his  army, through Worms and Ratisbon, towards Constantinople. At Ratisbon  he was met by a deputation from Manuel, bearing letters so full of  hyperbole and flattery, that Louis is reported to have blushed when  they were read to him by the Bishop of Langres. The object of the  deputation was to obtain from the French King a promise to pass through  the Grecian territories in a peaceable and friendly manner, and to  yield to the Greek Emperor any conquest he might make in Asia Minor.  The first part of the proposition was immediately acceded to, but no  notice was taken of the second and more unreasonable. Louis marched on,  and, passing through Hungary, pitched his tents in the outskirts of  Constantinople.    On his arrival, Manuel sent him a friendly invitation to enter the  city, at the head of a small train. Louis at once accepted it, and was  met by the Emperor at the porch of his palace. The fairest promises  were made; every art that flattery could suggest was resorted to, and  every argument employed, to induce him to yield his future conquests to  the Greek. Louis obstinately refused to pledge himself, and returned to  his army, convinced that the Emperor was a man not to be trusted.  Negotiations were, however, continued for several days, to the great  dissatisfaction of the French army. The news that arrived of a treaty  entered into between Manuel and the Turkish Sultan changed their  dissatisfaction into fury, and the leaders demanded to be led against  Constantinople, swearing that they would raze the treacherous city to  the ground. Louis did not feel inclined to accede to this proposal,  and, breaking up his camp, he crossed over into Asia.    Here he heard, for the first time, of the mishaps of the German  Emperor, whom he found in a woeful plight under the walls of Nice. The  two monarchs united their forces, and marched together along the  sea-coast to Ephesus; but Conrad, jealous, it would appear, of the  superior numbers of the French, and not liking to sink into a vassal,  for the time being, of his rival, withdrew abruptly with the remnant of  his legions, and returned to Constantinople. Manuel was all smiles and  courtesy. He condoled with the German so feelingly upon his losses, and  cursed the stupidity or treachery of the guides with such apparent  heartiness, that Conrad was half inclined to believe in his sincerity.    Louis, marching onward in the direction of Jerusalem, came up with the  enemy on the banks of the Meander. The Turks contested the passage of  the river, but the French bribed a peasant to point out a ford lower  down: crossing the river without difficulty, they attacked the Turks  with much vigour, and put them to flight. Whether the Turks were really  defeated, or merely pretended to be so, is doubtful; but the latter  supposition seems to be the true one. It is probable that it was part  of a concerted plan to draw the invaders onwards to more unfavourable  ground, where their destruction might be more certain. If such were the  scheme, it succeeded to the heart's wish of its projectors. The  crusaders, on the third day after their victory, arrived at a steep  mountain-pass, on the summit of which the Turkish host lay concealed so  artfully, that not the slightest vestige of their presence could be  perceived. \"With labouring steps and slow,\" they toiled up the steep  ascent, when suddenly a tremendous fragment of rock came bounding down  the precipices with an awful crash, bearing dismay and death before it.  At the same instant the Turkish archers started from their  hiding-places, and discharged a shower of arrows upon the foot  soldiers, who fell by hundreds at a time. The arrows rebounded  harmlessly against the iron mail of the knights, which the Turks  observing, took aim at their steeds, and horse and rider fell down the  steep into the rapid torrent which rushed below. Louis, who commanded  the rear-guard, received the first intimation of the onslaught from the  sight of his wounded and flying soldiers, and, not knowing the numbers  of the enemy, he pushed vigorously forward to stay, by his presence,  the panic which had taken possession of his army. All his efforts were  in vain. Immense stones continued to be hurled upon them as they  advanced, bearing men and horse before them; and those who succeeded in  forcing their way to the top, were met hand-to-hand by the Turks, and  cast down headlong upon their companions. Louis himself fought with the  energy of desperation, but had great difficulty to avoid falling into  the enemy's hands. He escaped at last under cover of the night, with  the remnant of his forces, and took up his position before Attalia.  Here he restored the discipline and the courage of his disorganized and  disheartened followers, and debated with his captains the plan that was  to be pursued. After suffering severely both from disease and famine,  it was resolved that they should march to Antioch, which still remained  an independent principality under the successors of Bohemund of  Tarentum.  At this time the sovereignty was vested in the person of  Raymond, the uncle of Eleanor of Aquitaine. This Prince, presuming upon  his relationship to the French Queen, endeavoured to withdraw Louis  from the grand object of the Crusade--the defence of the kingdom of  Jerusalem, and secure his co-operation in extending the limits and the  power of his principality of Antioch. The Prince of Tripoli formed a  similar design, but Louis rejected the offers of both, and marched  after a short delay to Jerusalem. The Emperor Conrad was there before  him, having left Constantinople with promises of assistance from Manuel  Comnenus; assistance which never arrived, and was never intended.    A great council of the Christian princes of Palestine and the leaders  of the Crusade was then summoned, to discuss the future operations of  the war. It was ultimately determined that it would further the cause  of the Cross in a greater degree if the united armies, instead of  proceeding to Edessa, laid siege to the city of Damascus, and drove the  Saracens from that strong position. This was a bold scheme, and, had it  been boldly followed out, would have insured, in all probability, the  success of the war. But the Christian leaders never learned from  experience the necessity of union, that very soul of great enterprises.  Though they all agreed upon the policy of the plan, yet every one had  his own notions as to the means of executing it. The Princes of Antioch  and Tripoli were jealous of each other, and of the King of Jerusalem.  The Emperor Conrad was jealous of the King of France, and the King of  France was disgusted with them all. But he had come out to Palestine in  accordance with a solemn vow; his religion, though it may be called  bigotry, was sincere; and he determined to remain to the very last  moment that a chance was left, of effecting any good for the cause he  had set his heart on.    The siege of Damascus was accordingly commenced, and with so much  ability and vigour that the Christians gained a considerable advantage  at the very outset. For weeks the siege was pressed, till the shattered  fortifications and diminishing resistance of the besieged gave evidence  that the city could not hold out much longer. At that moment the insane  jealousy of the leaders led to dissensions that soon caused the utter  failure, not only of the siege, but of the Crusade. A"]]]
