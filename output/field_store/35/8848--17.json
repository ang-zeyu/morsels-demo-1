[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#15)"],[1," do not know whether other observers have  paid any attention to the matter or not, but I am very familiar with the  manners of the parasitical starling or cow-bird of South America. The  warning cries of the foster parent have no effect on the young cow-bird  at any time. Until they are able to fly they will readily devour worms  from the hand of a man, even when the old birds are hovering close by  and screaming their danger notes, and while their own young, if the  parasite has allowed any to survive in the nest, are crouching down in  the greatest fear. After the cow-bird has left the nest it is still  stupidly tame, and more than once I have seen one carried off from its  elevated perch by a milvago hawk, when, if it had understood the warning  cry of the foster parent, it would have dropped down into the bush or  grass and escaped. But as soon as the young cow-birds are able to shift  for themselves, and begin to associate with their own kind, their habits  change, and they become suspicious and wild like other birds.    On this point--the later period at which the parasitical young bird  acquires fear of man--and also bearing on the whole subject under  discussion, I shall add here some observations I once made on a dove  hatched and reared by a pigeon at my home on the pampas. A very large  ombu tree grew not far from the dove-cote, and some of the pigeons used  to make their nests on the lower horizontal branches. One summer a dove  of the most common species, Zenaida maculata, in size a third less than  the domestic pigeon, chanced to drop an egg in one of these nests, and a  young dove was hatched and reared; and, in due time, when able to fly,  it was brought to the dove-cote. I watched it a great deal, and it was  evident that this foster-young, though' with the pigeons, was not nor  ever would be of them, for it could not take kiudly to their flippant  flirty ways. Whenever a male approached it, and with guttural noises and  strange gestures made a pompous declaration of amorous feelings, the  dove would strike vigorously at its undesirable lover, and drive him  off, big as he was; and, as a rule, it would sit apart, afoot or so,  from the others. The dove was also a male; but its male companions, with  instinct tainted by domestication, were ignorant alike of its sex and  different species. Now, it chanced that my pigeons, never being fed and  always finding their own living on the plain like wild birds, were,  although still domestic, not nearly so tame as pigeons usually are in  England. They would not allow a person to approach within two or three  yards of them without flying, and if grain was thrown to them they would  come to it very suspiciously, or not at all. And, of course, the young  pigeons always acquired the exact degree of suspicion shown by the  adults as soon as they were able to fly and consort with the others. But  the foundling Zenaida did not know what their startled gestures and  notes of fear meant when a person approached too near, and as he saw  none of his own kind, he did not acquire their suspicious habit. On the  contrary, he was perfectly tame, although by parentage a wild bird, and  showed no more fear of a man than of a horse. Throughout the winter it  remained with the pigeons, going afield every day with them, and  returning to the dove-cote; but as spring approached the slight tie  which united him to them began to be loosened; their company grew less  and less congenial, and he began to lead a solitary life. But he did not  go to the trees yet. He came to the house, and his favourite perch was  on the low overhanging roof of a vine-covered porch, just over the main  entrance. Here he would pass several hours every day, taking no notice  of the people passing in and out at all times; and when the weather grew  warm he would swell out his breast and coo mournfully by the hour for  our pleasure.    We can, no doubt, learn best by observing the behaviour of nestlings and  young birds; nevertheless, I find much even in the confirmed habits of  adults to strengthen me in the belief that fear of particular enemies is  in nearly all cases--for I will not say all--the result of experience  and tradition.    Hawks are the most open, violent, and persistent enemies birds have; and  it is really wonderful to see how well the persecuted kinds appear to  know the power for mischief possessed by different raptorial species,  and how exactly the amount of alarm exhibited is in proportion to the  extent of the danger to be apprehended. Some raptors never attack birds,  others only occasionally; still others prey only on the young and  feeble; and, speaking of La Plata district, where I have observed hawks,  from the milvago chimango--chiefly a carrion-eater--to the destructive  peregrine falcon, there is a very great variety of predatory habits, and  all degrees of courage to be found; yet all these raptors are treated  differently by species liable to be preyed on, and have just as much  respect paid them as their strength and daring entitles them to, and no  more, So much discrimination must seem almost incredible to those who  are not very familiar with the manners of wild birds; I do not think it  could exist if the fear shown resulted from instinct or inherited habit.  There would be no end to the blunders of such an instinct as that; and  in regions where hawks are extremely abundant most of the birds would be  in a constant state of trepidation. On the pampas the appearance of the  comparatively harmless chimango excites not the least alarm among small  birds, yet at a distance it closely resembles a henharrier, and it also  readily attacks young, sick, and wounded birds; all others know how  little they have to fear from it. When it appears unexpectedly,  sweeping over a hedge or grove with a rapid flight, it is sometimes  mistaken for a more dangerous species; there is then a little flutter of  alarm, some birds springing into the air, but in two or three seconds of  time they discover their mistake, and settle down quietly again, taking  no further notice of the despised carrion-eater. On the other hand, I  have frequently mistaken a harrier (Circus cinereus, in the brown state  of plumage) for a chimango, and have only discovered my mistake by  seeing the commotion among the small birds. The harrier I have  mentioned, also the C. macropterus, feed partly on small birds, which  they flush from the ground and strike down with their claws. When the  harrier appears moving along with a loitering flight near the surface,  it is everywhere attended by a little whirlwind of alarm, small birds  screaming or chirping excitedly and diving into the grass or bushes; but  the alarm does not spread far, and subsides as soon as the hawk has  passed on its way. Buzzards (Buteo and Urubitinga) are much more feared,  and create a more widespread alarm, and they ars certainly more  destructive to birds than harriers. Another curious instance is that of  the sociable hawk (Rostrhanrus sociabilis). This bird spends the summer  and breeds in marshes in La Plata, and birds pay no attention to it, for  it feeds exclusively on water-snails (Ampullaria). But when it visits  woods and plantations to roost, during migration, its appearance creates  as much alarm as that of a true buzzard, which it closely resembles.  Wood-birds, unaccustomed to see it, do not know its peculiar preying  habits, and how little they need fear its presence. I may also mention  that the birds of La Plata seem to fear the kite-like Elanus less than  other hawks, and I believe that its singular resemblance to the common  gull of the district in its size, snowy-white plumage and manner of  flight, has a deceptive effect on most species, and makes them so little  suspicious of it.    The wide-ranging peregrine falcon is a common species in La Plata,  although, oddly enough, not included in any notice of the avifauna of  that region before 1888. The consternation caused among birds by its  appearance is vastly greater than that produced by any of the raptors I  have mentioned: and it is unquestionably very much more destructive to  birds, since it preys exclusively on them, and, as a rule, merely picks  the flesh from the head and neck, and leaves the untouched body to its  jackal, the carrion-hawk. When the peregrine appears speeding through  the air in a straight line at a great height, the feathered world, as  far as one able to see, is thrown into the greatest commo-tion, all  birds, from the smallest up to species large as duck, ibis, and curlew,  rushing about in the air as if distracted. When the falcon has  disappeared in the sky, and the wave of terror attending its progress  subsides behind it, the birds still continue wild and excited for some  time, showing how deeply they have been moved; for, as a rule, fear is  exceedingly transitory in its effects on animals.    I must, before concluding this part of my subject, mention another  raptor, also a true falcon, but differing from the peregrine in being  exclusively a marsh-hawk. In size it is nearly a third less than the  male peregrine, which it resembles in its sharp wings and manner of  flight, but its flight is much more rapid. The whole plumage, is  uniformly of a dark grey colour. Unfortunately, though I have observed  it not fewer than a hundred times, I have never been able to procure a  specimen, nor do I find that it is like any American falcon already  described; so that for the present it must remain nameless. Judging  solely from the effect produced by the appearance of this hawk, it must  be even more daring and destructive than its larger relation, the  peregrine. It flies at a great height, and sometimes descends vertically  and with extraordinary velocity, the wings producing a sound like a  deep-toned horn. The sound is doubtless produced at will, and is  certainly less advantageous to the hawk than to the birds it pursues.

But the \"pressure\" theory does not  sustain examination.    The task thrust upon Peron in the writing of the historical narrative of  the voyage was one for which he had not prepared himself, and which did  not properly pertain to him. The death of Baudin, whose work this would  naturally have been, compelled the naturalist to become historian. He had  not kept the log, and it may be reasonably assumed that he had not  concerned himself in a particular degree with those events of which he  would have made careful notes had it been intended from the beginning  that he should be the official recorder. He had applied himself with  passionate energy to the collection and classification of zoological  specimens. This was his special vocation, and he pursued it worthily. It  is probably safe to say that no expedition, French or English, that ever  came down to Australasian waters, added so much that was new to the  world's scientific knowledge, or accumulated so much material, as did  this one whose chief naturalist was Francois Peron. When it is added that  two of the greatest figures in British scientific history, Darwin and  Huxley, were among the workers in this fruitful field, it will be  admitted that the acknowledgment is not made in any niggard spirit. But  we are now concerned with Peron as historian of what related to Terre  Naploeon and the surrounding circumstances. Here his statements have been  shown to be unreliable. It is probable that he wrote largely from memory;  almost certainly from insufficient data. Further, he was weak and ill  when engaged upon the book. The hardships and unhealthy conditions of the  voyage had undermined his constitution. One would conclude from his style  of writing that he was by temperament excitable and easily subject to  depression. A zealous savant, to whom fishes and birds, beetles and  butterflies, were the precious things of the earth, and for whom the  discovery of a new species was as great a source of joy as a glorious  victory was to his imperial master, Peron appeals to us as a pathetic  figure whom one would rather screen from blame than otherwise. He  suffered severely, and did his final work under the difficulty of  breaking health. He died in 1810, before his second volume was ready for  publication.    Freycinet wrote a series of notes by way of preface to volumes 2 and 3,  in attempted justification of the Terre Napoleon maps.* (* The second  volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes was published--out of its due  order--in 1816, the third in 1815.) He was put on the defensive because  \"the audacious attempt which was made in the first volume of this work,  to rob Captain Flinders of the well-earned merit of his nautical labours  and discoveries, while he was basely and barbarously kept in prison in a  French colony, was regarded with becoming indignation throughout Europe,  and with shame by the better part of the French nation.\"* (* Quarterly  Review volume 17 (1817) page 229.) That that is a fair description of the  state of feeling among people concerned with the advancement of  knowledge, is beyond question; and the French above all, with their love  of enterprise, their sentiment of honour, their eager applause of high  achievement, their chivalrous sense of justice, and their quick sympathy  with suffering wrongly inflicted and bravely borne, would have no taste  for laurels plucked in their name from the brow of him who was entitled  to wear them. Thoroughly repugnant to French intellect and feeling was  conduct of this description. National animosities were more bitter at  this period than they have ever been at any other time, but science knows  no nationality. Even when the two governments had ceased to have  relations with each other, we still find English and French men of  science communicating on friendly terms; and Napoleon himself was willing  to grant the requests of an English savant while English arms and English  diplomacy were at furious war with him. Thus Sir Joseph Banks, who was a  corresponding member of the Institute of France, could write in 1805, \"I  have obtained the release of five persons from the gracious condescension  of the Emperor, the only five, I believe, that have been regularly  discharged from their parole.\"    Freycinet, then, had to defend his charts. But there never was a more  complete example of the remark that \"qui s'excuse s'accuse.\" He argued  that when Le Geographe cruised along the coasts discovered by Flinders,  there was no published work in which they were described, therefore the  French were justified in applying their own names. But this plea ignored  the fact that if the coasts were not charted in any work published before  1807, they had been, to the full knowledge of the French officers,  charted by Flinders, whose work would have been published earlier if he  had not been forcibly detained. Again he argued* (* Preface to volume 3.)  that, inasmuch as \"jamais Peron ni moi\"--where Freycinet assumed part of  the responsibility--knew of the work done by Flinders until his book was  published, the work of the French was truly one of discovery; and as to  the names given by the English navigator, \"it is certain that we could  not employ them without knowing them.\" But it was not true that  Freycinet, Peron, or Baudin was unaware of the discoveries made by  Flinders. Even were there not his specific statement that he explained  his discoveries and showed one of his charts to illustrate them, it would  be incredible that while the French and English ships lay together for  some weeks at Port Jackson, with tents erected on the same piece of  ground, the officers frequently meeting on friendly terms, Freycinet and  Peron should not have learnt what the Investigator had been doing. Both  the French authors are individually mentioned by Flinders as having been  present on one or other of these occasions, and Freycinet does not deny  the statement. Further, Captain Hamelin reported to the French  Government, in 1803, that Flinders had traced the coast from the Leeuwin  to Encounter Bay, and had discovered a large and beautiful island which  he had named \"L'Ile des Kangaroux.\"* (* Moniteur, 27 Thermidor,  Revolutionary Year 11.)    It is true that the French were not acquainted with Flinders' names,  except in the one case of Kangaroo Island. He told Baudin what name he  had given in that case. Nevertheless they ignored it, and called the  island Ile Decres. But even when they did know of the names given to  features of the coast by a previous English navigator, Peron and  Freycinet disregarded them. Grant's Narrative of the Voyage of the Lady  Nelson was published, together with his eye-chart of the coast from Cape  Banks to Wilson's Promontory, in 1803. Flinders states positively that  Grant's \"discoveries were known to M. Peron and the French expedition in  1802\";* (* Voyage 1 201.) as indeed we might well suppose, for Grant was  not the man to allow any one with whom he came in contact to remain  unaware of his achievements, and he was in Sydney just before the French  arrived there. They would hear of him from many people. Yet Grant's  names, inscribed in plain print on his published chart, were all ignored  on the Terre Napoleon charts--his Cape Nelson becoming Cap Montaigne; his  Cape Otway, Cap Desaix; his Cape Schanck, Cap Richelieu; and so forth.    The contention that the south coast exploration of the French was  \"entirely a work of discovery,\"* (* Freycinet, 2 page 23.) although they  were forestalled in it by Flinders and Grant, is neither true nor  sensible. If it could be held that the voyage of a vessel sailing without  a chart or a pilot along a coast previously unknown to its officers was  \"entirely a work of discovery,\" then a ship that should sail under such  conditions along any piece of coast--say from Boulogne to La Hague--would  accomplish \"a work of discovery.\" Discovery is a matter of priority, or  the word is meaningless.    Freycinet's notes nowhere meet the gravest feature of the case--the  prolongation of the imprisonment of Flinders until the French could  complete their own charts for publication. The talk about not knowing  what Flinders' names were, the affected ignorance of his prior claims,  were crudely disingenuous. Freycinet knew perfectly where Flinders was,  and why his charts were not issued. The Moniteur contained several  references to his case. Sir Joseph Banks repeatedly pressed leading  members of the Institute to lend their influence to secure his  liberation. But Freycinet, who had shared in the generous hospitality of  the British governor in Sydney--extended at a time when the French crews  were sorely stricken--and should have been moved by gratitude, to say  nothing of justice, to help in undoing an act of wrong to a  fellow-navigator, does not seem to have taken the slightest step in this  direction, nor does he in any of his writings express any regret  concerning the unhappy fate that overtook the English captain.    The claim made in behalf of Baudin's expedition can best be stated in the  language of Peron. Dentrecasteaux, he wrote, not having advanced beyond  the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, which form the extremity of  Nuyts Land, and the English not having carried their researches farther  than Westernport, \"it follows that all the portion between the  last-mentioned port and Nuyts Land was unknown at the time when we  arrived on these shores.\" Peron's words were not candid. It is true that  part of the shores in question were unknown when Baudin's ships  \"arrived.\" They \"arrived\" off Cape Leeuwin in May 1801, before Flinders  left England, though not before Grant had discovered his stretch of  coast. (Grant reached Sydney, having roughly traced the coast from Cape  Banks to Cape Schanck, on December 16, 1800.) If, however, Peron meant to  convey that"]]]
