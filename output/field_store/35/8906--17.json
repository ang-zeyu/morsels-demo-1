[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#15)"],[1,"curious sensation to Tom and the others to feel that they were  actually walking along the bed of the ocean.  All around them was the  water, and as they turned on the small electric lights in their  helmets, which lights were fed by storage batteries fastened to the  diving suits, they saw the fish, big and little, swarm up to them,  doubtless astonished at the odd creatures which had entered their  domain. On the sand of the bottom, and in and out among the shells and  rocks, crawled great spider crabs, big eels and other odd creatures  seldom seen on the surface of the water.  The three divers found no  difficulty in breathing, as there were air tanks fastened to their  shoulders, and a constant supply of oxygen was fed through pipes into  the helmets. The pressure of water did not bother them, and after the  first sensation Tom began to enjoy the novelty of it. At first the  inability to speak to his companions seemed odd, but he soon got so he  could make signs and motions, and be understood.    They walked about for some time, and once the lad came upon a part of a  wrecked vessel buried deep in the sand.  There was no telling what ship  it was, nor how long it had been there, and after silently viewing it,  they continued on.    \"It was great!\" were the first words Tom uttered when he and the others  were once more inside the submarine and had removed the suits. \"If we  can only walk around the wreck of the Boldero that way, we'll have all  the gold out of her in no time. There are no life-lines nor air-hose to  bother with in these diving suits.\"    \"They certainly are a success,\" conceded Mr. Sharp.    \"Bless my topknot!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I'll try it next time. I've  always wanted to be a diver, and now I have the chance.\"    The trip was resumed after the diving chamber had been closed, and on  the third day Captain Weston announced, after a look at his chart, that  they were nearing the Bahama Islands.    \"We'll have to be careful not to run into any of the small keys,\" he  said, that being the name for the many little points of land, hardly  large enough to be dignified by the name of island. \"We must keep a  constant lookout.\"    Fortune favored them, though once, when Tom was steering, he narrowly  avoided ramming a coral reef with the submarine.  The searchlight  showed it to him just in time, and he sheered off with a thumping in  his heart.    The course was changed from south to east, so as to get ready to swing  out of the way of the big shoulder of South America where Brazil takes  up so much room, and as they went farther and farther toward the  equator, they noticed that the waters teemed more and more with fish,  some beautiful, some ugly and fear-inspiring, and some such monsters  that it made one shudder to look at them, even through the thick glass  of the bulls-eye windows.          Chapter Fifteen    At the Tropical Island      It was on the evening of the fourth day later that Captain Weston, who  was steering the craft, suddenly called out:    \"Land ho!\"    \"Where away?\" inquired Tom quickly, for he had read that this was the  proper response to make.    \"Dead ahead,\" answered the sailor with a smile. \"Shall we make for it,  if I may be allowed the question?\"    \"What land is it likely to be?\" Mr. Swift wanted to know.    \"Oh, some small tropical island,\" replied the seafaring man. \"It isn't  down on the charts. Probably it's too small to note. I should say it  was a coral island, but we may be able to find a spring of fresh water  there, and some fruit.\"    \"Then we'll land there,\" decided the inventor. \"We can use some fresh  water, though our distilling and ice apparatus does very well.\"    They made the island just at dusk, and anchored in a little lagoon,  where there was a good depth of water.    \"Now for shore!\" cried Tom, as the submarine swung around on the chain.  \"It looks like a fine place. I hope there are cocoanuts and oranges  here. Shall I get out the electric launch, dad?\"    \"Yes, you may, and we'll all go ashore. It will do us good to stretch  our legs a bit.\"    Carried in a sort of pocket on the deck of the submarine was a small  electric boat, capable of holding six. It could be slid from the  pocket, or depression, into the water without the use of davits, and,  with Mr. Sharp to aid him, Tom soon had the little craft afloat. The  batteries were already charged, and just as the sun was going down the  gold-seekers entered the launch and were soon on shore.    They found a good spring of water close at hand, and Tom's wish  regarding the cocoanuts was realized, though there were no oranges. The  lad took several of the delicious nuts, and breaking them open poured  the milk into a collapsible cup he carried, drinking it eagerly. The  others followed his example, and pronounced it the best beverage they  had tasted in a long time.    The island was a typical tropical one, not very large, and it did not  appear to have been often visited by man. There were no animals to be  seen, but myriads of birds flew here and there amid the trees, the  trailing vines and streamers of moss.    \"Let's spend a day here to-morrow and explore it,\" proposed Tom, and  his father nodded an assent. They went back to the submarine as night  was beginning to gather, and in the cabin, after supper, talked over  the happenings of their trip so far.    \"Do you think we'll have any trouble getting the gold out of the  wrecked vessel?\" asked Tom of Captain Weston, after a pause.    \"Well, it's hard to say. I couldn't learn just how the wreck lays,  whether it's on a sandy or a rocky bottom. If the latter, it won't be  so hard, but if the sand has worked in and partly covered it, we'll  have some difficulties, if I may be permitted to say so. However, don't  borrow trouble.  We're not there yet, though at the rate we're  traveling it won't be long before we arrive.\"    No watch was set that night, as it was not considered necessary. Tom  was the first to arise in the morning, and he went out on the deck for  a breath of fresh air before breakfast.    He looked off at the beautiful little island, and as his eye took in  all of the little lagoon where the submarine was anchored he uttered a  startled cry.    And well he might, for, not a hundred yards away, and nearer to the  island than was the Advance, floated another craft--another craft,  almost similar in shape and size to the one built by the Swifts. Tom  rubbed his eyes to make sure he was not seeing double. No, there could  be no mistake about it. There was another submarine at the tropical  island.    As he looked, some one emerged from the conning tower of the second  craft. The figure seemed strangely familiar. Tom knew in a moment who  it was--Addison Berg. The agent saw the lad, too, and taking off his  cap and making a mocking bow, he called out:    \"Good morning! Have you got the gold yet?\"    Tom did not know what to answer. Seeing the other submarine, at an  island where he had supposed they would not be disturbed, was  disconcerting enough, but to be greeted by Berg was altogether too  much, Tom thought. His fears that the rival boat builders would follow  had not been without foundation.    \"Rather surprised to see us, aren't you?\" went on Mr. Berg, smiling.    \"Rather,\" admitted Tom, choking over the word.    \"Thought you'd be,\" continued Berg. \"We didn't expect to meet you so  soon, but we're glad we did. I don't altogether like hunting for sunken  treasure, with such indefinite directions as I have.\"    \"You--are going to--\" stammered Tom, and then he concluded it would be  best not to say anything. But his talk had been heard inside the  submarine. His father came to the foot of the conning tower stairway.    \"To whom are you speaking, Tom?\" he asked.    \"They're here, dad,\" was the youth's answer.    \"Here? Who are here?\"    \"Berg and his employers. They've followed us, dad.\"          Chapter Sixteen    \"We'll Race You For It\"      Mr. Swift hurried up on deck. He was accompanied by Captain Weston. At  the sight of Tom's father, Mr. Berg, who had been joined by two other  men, called out:    \"You see we also concluded to give up the trial for the Government  prize, Mr. Swift. We decided there was more money in something else.  But we still will have a good chance to try the merits of our  respective boats. We hurried and got ours fitted up almost as soon as  you did yours, and I think we have the better craft.\"    \"I don't care to enter into any competition with you,\" said Mr. Swift  coldly.    \"Ah, but I'm afraid you'll have to, whether you want to or not,\" was  the insolent reply.    \"What's that?  Do you mean to force this matter upon me?\"    \"I'm afraid I'll have to--my employers and I, that is. You see, we  managed to pick up your trail after you left the Jersey coast, having  an idea where you were bound, and we don't intend to lose you now.\"    \"Do you mean to follow us?\" asked Captain Weston softly.    \"Well, you can put it that way if you like,\" answered one of the two  men with Mr. Berg.    \"I forbid it!\" cried Mr. Swift hotly. \"You have no right to sneak after  us.\"    \"I guess the ocean is free,\" continued the rascally agent.    \"Why do you persist in keeping after us?\" inquired the aged inventor,  thinking it well to ascertain, if possible, just how much the men knew.    \"Because we're after that treasure as well as you,\" was the bold reply.  \"You have no exclusive right to it. The sunken ship is awaiting the  first comer, and whoever gets there first can take the gold from the  wreck. We intend to be there first, but we'll be fair with you.\"    \"Fair? What do you mean?\" demanded Tom.    \"This: We'll race you for it. The first one to arrive will have the  right to search the wreck for the gold bullion. Is that fair? Do you  agree to it?\"    \"We agree to nothing with you,\" interrupted Captain Weston, his usual  diffident manner all gone. \"I happen to be in partial command of this  craft, and I warn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#15)"],[1,"the remark, but I said:    \"There's something beside love, Marshal. Love's for the heart; is there  nothing my brother might like for his head?\"    \"I pray that you wrong him, sire.\"    \"Marshal, I'm leaving Strelsau for a few days. Every evening I will  send a courier to you. If for three days none comes, you will publish an  order which I will give you, depriving Duke Michael of the governorship  of Strelsau and appointing you in his place. You will declare a state of  siege. Then you will send word to Michael that you demand an audience of  the King--You follow me?\"    \"Ay, sire.\"    \"--In twenty-four hours. If he does not produce the King\" (I laid my  hand on his knee), \"then the King is dead, and you will proclaim the  next heir. You know who that is?\"    \"The Princess Flavia.\"    \"And swear to me, on your faith and honour and by the fear of the living  God, that you will stand by her to the death, and kill that reptile, and  seat her where I sit now.\"    \"On my faith and honour, and by the fear of God, I swear it! And may  Almighty God preserve your Majesty, for I think that you go on an errand  of danger.\"    \"I hope that no life more precious than mine may be demanded,\" said I,  rising. Then I held out my hand to him.    \"Marshal,\" I said, \"in days to come, it may be--I know not--that you  will hear strange things of the man who speaks to you now. Let him be  what he may, and who he may, what say you of the manner in which he has  borne himself as King in Strelsau?\"    The old man, holding my hand, spoke to me, man to man.    \"I have known many of the Elphbergs,\" said he, \"and I have seen you.  And, happen what may, you have borne yourself as a wise King and a brave  man; ay, and you have proved as courteous a gentleman and as gallant a  lover as any that have been of the House.\"    \"Be that my epitaph,\" said I, \"when the time comes that another sits on  the throne of Ruritania.\"    \"God send a far day, and may I not see it!\" said he.    I was much moved, and the Marshal's worn face twitched. I sat down and  wrote my order.    \"I can hardly yet write,\" said I; \"my finger is stiff still.\"    It was, in fact, the first time that I had ventured to write more than  a signature; and in spite of the pains I had taken to learn the King's  hand, I was not yet perfect in it.    \"Indeed, sire,\" he said, \"it differs a little from your ordinary  handwriting. It is unfortunate, for it may lead to a suspicion of  forgery.\"    \"Marshal,\" said I, with a laugh, \"what use are the guns of Strelsau, if  they can't assuage a little suspicion?\"    He smiled grimly, and took the paper.    \"Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim go with me,\" I continued.    \"You go to seek the duke?\" he asked in a low tone.    \"Yes, the duke, and someone else of whom I have need, and who is at  Zenda,\" I replied.    \"I wish I could go with you,\" he cried, tugging at his white moustache.  \"I'd like to strike a blow for you and your crown.\"    \"I leave you what is more than my life and more than my crown,\" said I,  \"because you are the man I trust more than all other in Ruritania.\"    \"I will deliver her to you safe and sound,\" said he, \"and, failing that,  I will make her queen.\"    We parted, and I returned to the Palace and told Sapt and Fritz what  I had done. Sapt had a few faults to find and a few grumbles to  utter. This was merely what I expected, for Sapt liked to be consulted  beforehand, not informed afterwards; but on the whole he approved of my  plans, and his spirits rose high as the hour of action drew nearer and  nearer. Fritz, too, was ready; though he, poor fellow, risked more than  Sapt did, for he was a lover, and his happiness hung in the scale. Yet  how I envied him! For the triumphant issue which would crown him with  happiness and unite him to his mistress, the success for which we were  bound to hope and strive and struggle, meant to me sorrow more certain  and greater than if I were doomed to fail. He understood something of  this, for when we were alone (save for old Sapt, who was smoking at the  other end of the room) he passed his arm through mine, saying:    \"It's hard for you. Don't think I don't trust you; I know you have  nothing but true thoughts in your heart.\"    But I turned away from him, thankful that he could not see what my heart  held, but only be witness to the deeds that my hands were to do.    Yet even he did not understand, for he had not dared to lift his eyes to  the Princess Flavia, as I had lifted mine.    Our plans were now all made, even as we proceeded to carry them out, and  as they will hereafter appear. The next morning we were to start on the  hunting excursion. I had made all arrangements for being absent, and  now there was only one thing left to do--the hardest, the most  heart-breaking. As evening fell, I drove through the busy streets to  Flavia's residence. I was recognized as I went and heartily cheered. I  played my part, and made shift to look the happy lover. In spite of my  depression, I was almost amused at the coolness and delicate hauteur  with which my sweet lover received me. She had heard that the King was  leaving Strelsau on a hunting expedition.    \"I regret that we cannot amuse your Majesty here in Strelsau,\" she said,  tapping her foot lightly on the floor. \"I would have offered you more  entertainment, but I was foolish enough to think--\"    \"Well, what?\" I asked, leaning over her.    \"That just for a day or two after--after last night--you might be happy  without much gaiety;\" and she turned pettishly from me, as she added, \"I  hope the boars will be more engrossing.\"    \"I'm going after a very big boar,\" said I; and, because I could not help  it, I began to play with her hair, but she moved her head away.    \"Are you offended with me?\" I asked, in feigned surprise, for I could  not resist tormenting her a little. I had never seen her angry, and  every fresh aspect of her was a delight to me.    \"What right have I to be offended? True, you said last night that every  hour away from me was wasted. But a very big boar! that's a different  thing.\"    \"Perhaps the boar will hunt me,\" I suggested. \"Perhaps, Flavia, he'll  catch me.\"    She made no answer.    \"You are not touched even by that danger?\"    Still she said nothing; and I, stealing round, found her eyes full of  tears.    \"You weep for my danger?\"    Then she spoke very low:    \"This is like what you used to be; but not like the King--the King I--I  have come to love!\"    With a sudden great groan, I caught her to my heart.    \"My darling!\" I cried, forgetting everything but her, \"did you dream  that I left you to go hunting?\"    \"What then, Rudolf? Ah! you're not going--?\"    \"Well, it is hunting. I go to seek Michael in his lair.\"    She had turned very pale.    \"So, you see, sweet, I was not so poor a lover as you thought me. I  shall not be long gone.\"    \"You will write to me, Rudolf?\"    I was weak, but I could not say a word to stir suspicion in her.    \"I'll send you all my heart every day,\" said I.    \"And you'll run no danger?\"    \"None that I need not.\"    \"And when will you be back? Ah, how long will it be!\"    \"When shall I be back?\" I repeated.    \"Yes, yes! Don't be long, dear, don't be long. I shan't sleep while  you're away.\"    \"I don't know when I shall be back,\" said I.    \"Soon, Rudolf, soon?\"    \"God knows, my darling. But, if never--\"    \"Hush, hush!\" and she pressed her lips to mine.    \"If never,\" I whispered, \"you must take my place; you'll be the only one  of the House then. You must reign, and not weep for me.\"    For a moment she drew herself up like a very queen.    \"Yes, I will!\" she said. \"I will reign. I will do my part though all my  life will be empty and my heart dead; yet I'll do it!\"    She paused, and sinking against me again, wailed softly.    \"Come soon! come soon!\"    Carried away, I cried loudly:    \"As God lives, I--yes, I myself--will see you once more before I die!\"    \"What do you mean?\" she exclaimed, with wondering eyes; but I had no  answer for her, and she gazed at me with her wondering eyes.    I dared not ask her to forget, she would have found it an insult. I  could not tell her then who and what I was. She was weeping, and I had  but to dry her tears.    \"Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?\"  said I. \"A thousand Michaels should not keep me from you!\"    She clung to me, a little comforted.    \"You won't let Michael hurt you?\"    \"No, sweetheart.\"    \"Or keep you from me?\"    \"No, sweetheart.\"    \"Nor anyone else?\"    And again I answered:    \"No, sweetheart.\"    Yet there was one--not Michael--who, if he lived, must keep me from  her; and for whose life I was going forth to stake my own. And his  figure--the lithe, buoyant figure I had met in the woods of Zenda--the  dull, inert mass I had left in the cellar of the hunting-lodge--seemed  to rise, double-shaped, before me, and to come between us, thrusting  itself in even where she lay, pale, exhausted, fainting, in my arms, and  yet looking up at me with those eyes that bore such love as I have never  seen, and haunt me now, and will till the ground closes over me--and  (who knows?) perhaps beyond.          CHAPTER 12    I Receive a Visitor and Bait a Hook      About five miles from Zenda--on the opposite side from that on which  the Castle is situated, there lies a large tract of wood. It is rising  ground, and in the centre of the demesne, on the top of the hill, stands  a fine modern chateau, the property of a distant kinsman of Fritz's, the  Count Stanislas von Tarlenheim. Count Stanislas himself was a student  and a recluse. He seldom visited the house, and had, on Fritz's request,  very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and  my party. This, then, was our destination; chosen ostensibly for the  sake of the boar-hunting (for the wood was carefully preserved, and  boars, once common all over Ruritania, were still to be found there  "]]]
