Thus to thy husband's house    Wilt thou a blessing prove, and not a curse.    What thinks Gautami of this advice?    GAUTAMI.    An excellent compendium, truly, of every wife's duties! Lay it  well to heart, my daughter.    KANWA.    Come, my beloved child, one parting embrace for me and for thy  companions, and then we leave thee.    [S']AKOONTALA.    My father, must Priyamvada and Anasuya really return with you?  They are very dear to me.    KANWA.    Yes, my child; they, too, in good time, will be given in marriage  to suitable husbands. It would not be proper for them to  accompany thee to such a public place. But Gautami shall be thy  companion.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                    [_Embracing him_.    Removed from thy bosom, my beloved father, like a young  tendril of the sandal-tree torn from its home in the western  mountains[71], how shall I be able to support life in a foreign  soil?    KANWA.    Daughter, thy fears are groundless.      Soon shall thy lord prefer thee to the rank    Of his own consort; and unnumbered cares    Befitting his imperial dignity    Shall constantly engross thee. Then the bliss    Of bearing him a son--a noble boy,    Bright as the day-star, shall transport thy soul    With new delights, and little shalt thou reck    Of the light sorrow that afflicts thee now    At parting from thy father and thy friends.           [[S']AKOONTALA _throws herself at her foster-father's feet_.    KANWA.    Blessings on thee, my child! May all my hopes of thee be  realized!    [S']AKOONTALA                           [_Approaching her friends_.    Come, my two loved companions, embrace me both of you together.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.                         [_Embracing her_.    Dear [S']akoontala, remember, if the King should by any chance be  slow in recognizing you, you have only to show him this ring, on  which his own name is engraved.    [S']AKOONTALA.    The bare thought of it puts me in a tremor.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    There is no real cause for fear, dearest. Excessive affection is  too apt to suspect evil where none exists.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Come, lady, we must hasten on. The sun is rising in the heavens.    [S']AKOONTALA.                    [_Looking towards the hermitage_.    Dear father, when shall I ever see this hallowed grove again?    KANWA.    I will tell thee; listen:--      When thou hast passed a long and blissful life    As King Dushyanta's queen, and jointly shared    With all the earth his ever-watchful care;    And hast beheld thine own heroic son,    Matchless in arms, united to a bride    In happy wedlock; when his aged sire,    Thy faithful husband, hath to him resigned    The helm of state; then, weary of the world,    Together with Dushyanta thou shalt seek    The calm seclusion of thy former home[72];    There amid holy scenes to be at peace,    Till thy pure spirit gain its last release.    GAUTAMI.    Come, my child, the favourable time for our journey is fast  passing. Let thy father return. Venerable Sire, be thou the first  to move homewards, or these last words will never end.    KANWA.    Daughter, detain me no longer. My religious duties must not be  interrupted.    [S']AKOONTALA.                [_Again embracing her foster-father_.    Beloved father, thy frame is much enfeebled by penitential  exercises. Do not, oh! do not, allow thyself to sorrow too much  on my account.    KANWA.                                                [_Sighing_.      How, O my child, shall my bereaved heart    Forget its bitterness, when, day by day,    Full in my sight shall grow the tender plants    Reared by thy care, or sprang from hallowed grain    Which thy loved hands have strewn around the door--    A frequent offering to our household gods[73]?    Go, my daughter, and may thy journey be prosperous.                               [_Exit_ [S']AKOONTALA _with her escort_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.              [_Gazing after_ [S']AKOONTALA.    Alas! alas! she is gone, and now the trees hide our darling from  our view.    KANWA.                                                [_Sighing_.    Well, Anasuya, your sister has departed. Moderate your grief,  both of you, and follow me, I go back to the hermitage.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Holy father, the sacred grove will be a desert without  [S']akoontala. How can we ever return to it?    KANWA.    It is natural enough that your affection should make you view it  in this light.    [_Walking pensively on_.]    As for me, I am quite surprised at myself. Now that I have fairly  dismissed her to her husband's house, my mind is easy; for,  indeed,      A daughter is a loan--a precious jewel    Lent to a parent till her husband claim her.    And now that to her rightful lord and master    I have delivered her, my burdened soul    Is lightened, and I seem to breathe more freely.

MA[T.]HAVYA.                                          [_Listening_.    Hark! my dear friend, listen a minute, and you will hear sweet  sounds proceeding from the music-room. Some one is singing a  charming air. Who can it be? Oh! I know. The queen Hansapadika is  practising her notes, that she may greet you with a new song.    KING.    Hush! Let me listen.    A VOICE SINGS BEHIND THE SCENES.      How often hither didst thou rove,    Sweet bee, to kiss the mango's cheek;    Oh! leave not, then, thy early love,    The lily's honeyed lip to seek.    KING.    A most impassioned strain, truly!    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Do you understand the meaning of the words?    KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.    She means to reprove me, because I once paid her great attention,  and have lately deserted her for the queen Vasumati. Go, my dear  fellow, and tell Hansapadika from me that I take her delicate  reproof as it is intended.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Very well.    [_Rising from his seat_.]    But stay--I don't much relish being sent to bear the brunt of her  jealousy. The chances are that she will have me seized by the  hair of the head and beaten to a jelly. I would as soon expose  myself, after a vow of celibacy, to the seductions of a lovely  nymph, as encounter the fury of a jealous woman.    KING.    Go, go; you can disarm her wrath by a civil speech; but give her  my message.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    What must be must be, I suppose.                                                             [_Exit_.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    Strange! that song has filled me with a most peculiar sensation.  A melancholy feeling has come over me, and I seem to yearn after  some long-forgotten object of affection. Singular, indeed! but      Not seldom In our happy hours of ease,    When thought is still, the sight of some fair form,    Or mournful fall of music breathing low,    Will stir strange fancies, thrilling all the soul    With a mysterious sadness, and a sense    Of vague yet earnest longing. Can it be    That the dim memory of events long past,    Or friendships formed in other states of being[74],    Flits like a passing shadow o'er the spirit?                                          [_Remains pensive and sad_.    _Enter the_ CHAMBERLAIN[75], _named_ VATAYANA.    CHAMBERLAIN.    Alas! to what an advanced period of life have I attained!      Even this wand betrays the lapse of years;    In youthful days 'twas but a useless badge    And symbol of my office; now it serves    As a support to prop my tottering steps.    Ah me! I feel very unwilling to announce to the King that a  deputation of young hermits from the sage Kanwa has arrived, and  craves an immediate audience. Certainly, his Majesty ought not to  neglect a matter of sacred duty, yet I hardly like to trouble him  when he has just risen from the judgment-seat. Well, well; a  monarch's business is to sustain the world, and he must not  expect much repose; because--      Onward, for ever onward, in his car    The unwearied Sun pursues his daily course,    Nor tarries to unyoke his glittering steeds.    And, ever moving, speeds the rushing Wind    Through boundless space, filling the universe    With his life-giving breezes. Day and night,    The King of Serpents on his thousand heads[76]    Upholds the incumbent earth; and even so,    Unceasing toil is aye the lot of kings,    Who, in return, draw nurture from their subjects.    I will therefore deliver my message.    [_Walking on and looking about_.]    Ah! here comes the King.      His subjects are his children; through the day,    Like a fond father, to supply their wants,    Incessantly he labours; wearied now,    The monarch seeks seclusion and repose;    E'en as the prince of elephants defies    The sun's fierce heat, and leads the fainting herd    To verdant pastures, ere his wayworn limbs    He yields to rest beneath the cooling shade.    [_Approaching_.]    Victory to the King! So please your Majesty, some hermits who  live in a forest near the Snowy Mountains have arrived here,  bringing certain women with them. They have a message to deliver  from the sage Kanwa and desire an audience. I await your  Majesty's commands.    KING.                                            [_Respectfully_.    A message from the sage Kanwa, did you say?    CHAMBERLAIN.    Even so, my liege.    KING.    Tell my domestic priest Somarata to receive the hermits with due  honour, according to the prescribed form. He may then himself  introduce them into my presence. I will await them in a place  suitable for the reception of such holy guests."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#16)"],[1," of life--but also for the  alteration in his handwriting.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Thorndyke, \"that seems to be so. By the way, what did the  change in the handwriting amount to?\"    \"Very little,\" replied Marchmont. \"It was hardly perceptible. Just a  slight loss of firmness and distinctness; such a trifling change as you  would expect to find in the handwriting of a man who had taken to drink  or drugs, or anything that might impair the steadiness of his hand. I  should not have noticed it, myself, but, of course, the people at the  bank are experts, constantly scrutinizing signatures and scrutinizing  them with a very critical eye.\"    \"Is there any other evidence that bears on the case?\" Thorndyke asked.    Marchmont turned over the bundle of papers and smiled grimly.    \"My dear Thorndyke,\" he said, \"none of this evidence has the slightest  bearing on the case. It is all perfectly irrelevant as far as the will  is concerned. But I know your little peculiarities and I am indulging  you, as you see, to the top of your bent. The next evidence is that of  the chief porter, a very worthy and intelligent man named Walker. This  is what he says, after the usual preliminaries.    \"'I have viewed the body which forms the subject of this inquiry. It is  that of Mr. Jeffrey Blackmore, the tenant of a set of chambers on the  second floor of number thirty-one, New Inn. I have known the deceased  nearly six months, and during that time have seen and conversed with him  frequently. He took the chambers on the second of last October and came  into residence at once. Tenants at New Inn have to furnish two  references. The references that the deceased gave were his bankers and  his brother, Mr. John Blackmore. I may say that the deceased was very  well known to me. He was a quiet, pleasant-mannered gentleman, and it  was his habit to drop in occasionally at the lodge and have a chat with  me. I went into his chambers with him once or twice on some small  matters of business and I noticed that there were always a number of  books and papers on the table. I understood from him that he spent most  of his time indoors engaged in study and writing. I know very little  about his way of living. He had no laundress to look after his rooms, so  I suppose he did his own house-work and cooking; but he told me that he  took most of his meals outside, at restaurants or his club.    \"'Deceased impressed me as a rather melancholy, low-spirited gentleman.  He was very much troubled about his eyesight and mentioned the matter to  me on several occasions. He told me that he was practically blind in one  eye and that the sight of the other was failing rapidly. He said that  this afflicted him greatly, because his only pleasure in life was in the  reading of books, and that if he could not read he should not wish to  live. On another occasion he said that \"to a blind man life was not  worth living.\"    \"'On the twelfth of last November he came to the lodge with a paper in  his hand which he said was his will'--But I needn't read that,\" said  Marchmont, turning over the leaf, \"I've told you how the will was signed  and witnessed. We will pass on to the day of poor Jeffrey's death.    \"'On the fourteenth of March,' the porter says, 'at about half-past six  in the evening, the deceased came to the Inn in a four-wheeled cab. That  was the day of the great fog. I do not know if there was anyone in the  cab with the deceased, but I think not, because he came to the lodge  just before eight o'clock and had a little talk with me. He said that  he had been overtaken by the fog and could not see at all. He was quite  blind and had been obliged to ask a stranger to call a cab for him as he  could not find his way through the streets. He then gave me a cheque for  the rent. I reminded him that the rent was not due until the  twenty-fifth, but he said he wished to pay it now. He also gave me some  money to pay one or two small bills that were owing to some of the  tradespeople--a milk-man, a baker and a stationer.    \"'This struck me as very strange, because he had always managed his  business and paid the tradespeople himself. He told me that the fog had  irritated his eye so that he could hardly read, and he was afraid he  should soon be quite blind. He was very depressed; so much so that I  felt quite uneasy about him. When he left the lodge, he went back across  the square as if returning to his chambers. There was then no gate open  excepting the main gate where the lodge is situated. That was the last  time that I saw the deceased alive.'\"    Mr. Marchmont laid the paper on the table. \"That is the porter's  evidence. The remaining depositions are those of Noble, the night  porter, John Blackmore and our friend here, Mr. Stephen. The night  porter had not much to tell. This is the substance of his evidence:    \"'I have viewed the body of the deceased and identify it as that of Mr.  Jeffrey Blackmore. I knew the deceased well by sight and occasionally  had a few words with him. I know nothing of his habits excepting that he  used to sit up rather late. It is one of my duties to go round the Inn  at night and call out the hours until one o'clock in the morning. When  calling out \"one o'clock\" I often saw a light in the sitting-room of the  deceased's chambers. On the night of the fourteenth instant, the light  was burning until past one o'clock, but it was in the bedroom. The light  in the sitting-room was out by ten o'clock.'    \"We now come to John Blackmore's evidence. He says:    \"'I have viewed the body of the deceased and recognize it as that of my  brother Jeffrey. I last saw him alive on the twenty-third of February,  when I called at his chambers. He then seemed in a very despondent state  of mind and told me that his eyesight was fast failing. I was aware that  he occasionally smoked opium, but I did not know that it was a confirmed  habit. I urged him, on several occasions, to abandon the practice. I  have no reason to believe that his affairs were in any way embarrassed  or that he had any reason for making away with himself other than his  failing eyesight; but, having regard to his state of mind when I last  saw him, I am not surprised at what has happened.'    \"That is the substance of John Blackmore's evidence, and, as to Mr.  Stephen, his statement merely sets forth the fact that he had identified  the body as that of his uncle Jeffrey. And now I think you have all the  facts. Is there anything more that you want to ask me before I go, for I  must really run away now?\"    \"I should like,\" said Thorndyke, \"to know a little more about the  parties concerned in this affair. But perhaps Mr. Stephen can give me  the information.\"    \"I expect he can,\" said Marchmont; \"at any rate, he knows more about  them than I do; so I will be off. If you should happen to think of any  way,\" he continued, with a sly smile, \"of upsetting that will, just let  me know, and I will lose no time in entering a caveat. Good-bye! Don't  trouble to let me out.\"    As soon as he was gone, Thorndyke turned to Stephen Blackmore.    \"I am going,\" he said, \"to ask you a few questions which may appear  rather trifling, but you must remember that my methods of inquiry  concern themselves with persons and things rather than with documents.  For instance, I have not gathered very completely what sort of person  your uncle Jeffrey was. Could you tell me a little more about him?\"    \"What shall I tell you?\" Stephen asked with a slightly embarrassed air.    \"Well, begin with his personal appearance.\"    \"That is rather difficult to describe,\" said Stephen. \"He was a  medium-sized man and about five feet seven--fair, slightly grey,  clean-shaved, rather spare and slight, had grey eyes, wore spectacles  and stooped a little as he walked. He was quiet and gentle in manner,  rather yielding and irresolute in character, and his health was not at  all robust though he had no infirmity or disease excepting his bad  eyesight. His age was about fifty-five.\"    \"How came he to be a civil-service pensioner at fifty-five?\" asked  Thorndyke.    \"Oh, that was through an accident. He had a nasty fall from a horse,  and, being a rather nervous man, the shock was very severe. For some  time after he was a complete wreck. But the failure of his eyesight was  the actual cause of his retirement. It seems that the fall damaged his  eyes in some way; in fact he practically lost the sight of one--the  right--from that moment; and, as that had been his good eye, the  accident left his vision very much impaired. So that he was at first  given sick leave and then allowed to retire on a pension.\"    Thorndyke noted these particulars and then said:    \"Your uncle has been more than once referred to as a man of studious  habits. Does that mean that he pursued any particular branch of  learning?\"    \"Yes. He was an enthusiastic Oriental scholar. His official duties had  taken him at one time to Yokohama and Tokio and at another to Bagdad,  and while at those places he gave a good deal of attention to the  languages, literature and arts of the countries. He was also greatly  interested in Babylonian and Assyrian archaeology, and I believe he  assisted for some time in the excavations at Birs Nimroud.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Thorndyke. \"This is very interesting. I had no idea that  he was a man of such considerable attainments. The facts mentioned by  Mr. Marchmont would hardly have led one to think of him as what he seems  to have been: a scholar of some distinction.\"    \"I don't know that Mr. Marchmont realized the fact himself,\" said  Stephen; \"or that he would have considered it of any moment if he had.  Nor, as far as that goes, do I. But, of course, I have no experience of  legal matters.\"    \"You can never tell beforehand,\" said Thorndyke, \"what facts may turn  out to be of moment, so that it is best to collect all you can get. By  the way, were you aware that your uncle was an opium-smoker?\"    \"No, I was"]]]
